1,fail,"If you must watch this I would prepare something to multitask with. I regret that I gave this movie my undivided attention.This movie made no sense and its plot was about as coherent as a reality tv show. The special effects were good, yes, but if it had no effects this movie would not have anything to stand on. The producer's standpoint is fully transparent in that the only function of the movie is to cater to a certain audience (14-16 years old).And this is NOT jealousy speaking but I could not shake the vibe that the main character was supposed to have a ""look how cute I am"" thing going on at all times. And yes his girlfriends was hot but besides them both modeling around aimlessly this movie has no substance whatsoever."
2,Buffy The Vampire Slayer had a better story...,interesting premise...but not a very good movie...fast forwarded a lot...dont waste your money.it seems like a B movie written by the same person as Twilight....over a weekend...not impressed.
5,great movie. Spiritual battle,"I related this DVD to a biblical story, the hero has a POWER INSIDE him that blasts forth when evil is near. Evil activates his super power. 10 stars, this should be shown in every church in the world.Believers have the HOLY SPIRIT living inside, When Evil manifests. Gods power is released to crush evil/ 10 stars.No refeference to church or religon. it is not about church on the surface, But it is deep.."
3,Godd,This was a good story. I don't know why it bombed. I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it if asked.
2,All is as expected.,"No spoiler here.I thought is was well done, no doubt, but ... Well, to me, it's a shallow action movie. I was hoping for a bit better plot. Perhaps my hopes were misplaced."
1,"HE MAY VERY WELL BE NUMBER FOUR, BUT THIS MOVIE IS NUMBER TWO!","Good Lord! What is going on in this world when this ""Twilight"" Sci-Fi drama can pass for entertainment? I mean this film makes the Twilight series almost seem watch-able. I really wanted to like this film, as the premise sounded interesting, but after only minutes I could see what franchise audience this film was after and it certainly wasn't mine. It's just a terrible film on all levels, even as an adolescent coming of age movie with puppy love romance, it just fails. Horrible and a complete waste of time."
1,???,The book was great but the movie was quite disappointing. Really glad I read the book first. Maybe I just expected too much. Really tired of good books being made into poor movies. Another example is Eragon. Highly recommend the book but not the movie.
1,New version of Teenage - wolf vs vampire movie,"Ugghh! the same ol'dumb story. Pretty girl, pretty boy, some monsters and cool music and lets call it a movie and not a 2 hour long music video. The plot was simple early in the beginning you've pretty much figured out what is going to happen. The kid is arrogant and his behavior contradicts normal convention. When being chased you don't draw attention to yourself, you especially don't stop to take the time to develop pictures. Hey, I only spent a dollar and two hours of my life, if you have the money and time to waste Knock yourself out."
1,Mainstream B movie at best,this is a b movie advertised as a mainstram one.... It has terrible acting.... bad effects... I could not even sit through the whole movie...
2,This movie is like twilight but with an alien!,I had high hopes for this film but the entire movie feels like a bad high school kids tv show it gets really old with the romance and all that the story its pretty weak and alex pettyfer its an irritating guy i honestly cant stomach the guy he just pisses me off the entire movie the movie itself has some action scenes that are decent but most of the movie its like an episode of dawsons creek and its not good i would say just fast forward the movie to the ending that its the only entertaining part in the entire film.
4,Good Movie,Action Packed. Great special effects. Very entertaining. I would recommend this movie to my friends and anyone else. It was ok for my 12 yr old to see. I appreciated that.
4,Twilight for SciFi,"I actually enjoyed this movie, especially since the hero has my kinda dog! As my title suggests, this was a movie made more for young people than adults. But, it's still a whole lot better than almost any of the films in sci-fi you can watch for free on Amazon Instant Videos that it was well worth the $1.99!And a much better love story than Twilight!"
2,Wasn't believable,"The storyline couldn't keep me engages, and I love these sort of fantastical stories. The execution of the special effects didn't help things any...."
1,horrible,usually the book is better and this situation is no different. this was more of a meant for tv movie that a major motion picture. they could have done better.
3,Decent pilot for the TV series,"Decent pilot for the TV series. Sets up the premise well, introduces some interesting and contrasting characters, and launches them on a quest (like a lot of adventure shows in the 70s which traveled from location to location around the country each episode). The show still needs some development but should settle in after a few episodes especially if Marti Noxon (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) stays on board - perhaps even as story editor.What? It's not a TV pilot? It's supposed to be a feature film?Well, for a feature film it makes a good TV pilot."
2,Twilight knock-off gone wrong,This movie has some decent effects and had the potential to be good but it fails to deliver. It plays out like a poor Twilight knock-off using an alien instead of a Vampire.
2,I am Number Four,I knew this movie would be bad but I decided to see it anyway because of Timothy Olyphant.The movie was slow and I didn't like most of the characters.I only liked the last 20 minutes of the movie.The aliens look like something from Star Trek:The Next Generation.The special effects were bad.The best part of this movie was the dog.This movie will probably appeal to teenagers and college kids but adults(I'm 35)will probably not like this movie.
3,I Am Number Four,"The film does a reasonable job of adapting the novel to the screen. It is not a blockbuster, however. The novel contains some really descriptive battle scenes, and CGI could have brought them to life much better than this film did. Also, the details of the box, and the orb that reveals the nature of their home galaxy, should have been included in the film. It leaves a big gap for subsequent films to overcome or fill in. I am looking forward to the next novel in the series, but have doubts if the number two and/or three will ever make it to the silver screen."
3,Teen Fantasy,"Who is number four? The first three are killed shortly after the movie starts, and in the rest of the movie we watch John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) with his guardian (Timothy Olyphant) try to blend in and survive. Any romance? Sure, John Smith gets tangled with Sarah in high school, and that complicates everything.This is a light movie, and you have to suspend your logic and disbelief. In some ways it reminded me of X-men series of movies. The movie ends in such a way that there is a possibility for a sequel.One more thing: John Smith punishes the bully and his thugs in high school and gets the girl. I also liked the number six with her special abilities. The special effects look cheesy, but who cares, it is an entertainment.It is a mindless light movie to watch at your own risk! :)"
3,"Petyfer Pretty, but Four Homely","While there's no doubt that Petyfer is easy on the eyes, the movie on the whole is pretty homely. Not a whole lot going on that isn't a tease for sequels. Not much action either until the last third of the film and then pretty cheesy at that. So, this is just another mediocre entry in the watch this if you haven't got anything better to do and you can rent it for a buck at Redbox category."
3,*Yawn* - Fast Forward Past the Fluff to the End..,"Part Teenage Soap Opera, part Sci-Fi actioner, I Am Number Four has trouble deciding what it wants to be - until the very end.The Teen angst riddled main character is an alien hiding out on Earth. He has special powers but very little common sense. He meets a girl, falls for her, then has to contend with her Ex; moaning and complaining along the way. At one point I was rooting for the bad aliens to get him. *Yawn*..But then things got interesting at the end, TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE...*ZAP* *BANG* *SLASH* *MONSTER ATTACK* *GUNPLAY* = It was good enough to wake me up, since I fell asleep watching the lame first hour.A decent rental - Just do yourself a favor, FF to the end."
2,"More action, less talking!",It was an okay movie. I was disappointed that all the action seemed to be in the last twenty minutes.
3,A Lesson In Investment,"Man, never before have I seen such a varied audience reaction for an Amazon product. 1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star, and 5 star reviews all by the exact same number of people.Here's what I think happened. I think the movie set out to be a special effects superhero blockbuster, but then realized it didn't really have much character in the protagonist to build on, and so it wisely figured to cut the funding necessary to be a blockbuster. With a cut budget, it padded much of the movie with a romantic teeny-bopper subplot, and saved all the good action-packed special-effect stuff until the very end. I bet it made a good profit too. Just not as much as the even more mediocre Roger Corman movies (percentage-wise and adjusted for inflation).Definitely mediocre, but as my fiancee said, it's worth a buck to see."
1,All Of That For Nothing,"Take one sociopath stalker ex boyfriend, the token nerdy kid, the Australian bad ass girl that tosses out the random sexual innuendos during the last epic battle, the girl-next-door-once-cheerleader, and scary aliens you get this movie.It was like watching a boring episode of Dawson's Creek with all the lovey-dovey, night attack by psycho-ex boyfriend, and ""small town"" feeling.The best part of this movie was the dog at the END when he showed back up!We had a lot of ""Why didn't you do that in the first place?"" moments with this movie. It's as if the main male lead (do any of the girls count since they were in the movie so little and did so little to move the plot?) forgets he has powers and just hides for a bit.The book has to be a completely stellar work compared to this shoddy movie."
3,Second half is better than the first,"I turned this video off after watching half of it and went to write a review. I saw so many positive reviews that I was thinking I must have watched a different story. Curious, I went back and watched the rest of it, and the second half was much better than the first. It's not a bad way to kill a couple of hours. Most of it I considered mediocre - the plot, the dialogue, the acting - but the action in the second half saved this movie from being a total dud. The younger set might enjoy it more."
1,One word Twilight,"I think this is the same story as Twilight as far as I could stomach it. Although I will say, far better acting than that other schlock."
3,Much better than expected.,"The movie surprised me. There was more of a story than I expected, the plot held together, the casting was good, and the acting was not overwrought. As baby boomers, the superhero-teenager-coming-of-age-first-love genre is usually gag-worthy, but this story was surprisingly sweet, engaging, and dramatic. The whole killing-children thing is a pretty sick artefact of our modern movie craze, but this screenplay treated the whole subject with more sensitivity and depth - as in these kids are about the age of young soldiers and they are indeed at war in defense of all of us."
3,It was Good but it could've been Great,"I enjoy Micheal Bay Productions they are futuristic and visually impactful but this, seemed to have a great premise even if it was for only one movie but it appeared to be second rate given the super quality of Micheal Bay's work. The performances were good but overall it seemed to lack a true commitment from the screenwriter. The whole alien nation with a few survivors being deployed to earth was a great plot but nothing more came of it. The back story needed to be integrated throughout the movie so we as viewers become invested in the reason for the conflict in the first place."
3,ehhhh,I have watched better movies. Might have liked this more if i thought the story was going somewhere. They don't appear to be making anymore movies involving these characters.
3,Its OK,"This movie takes a while to get going and eventually works its way up to make it mildly entertaining. I'm not sure that I would rent it again, but it was worth $1.99."
5,Damn Good Remake of Book-Make More!!,"Based off the book.... Really good interpretation of it. Spot on, or nearly! Please make more of the books into movies!!"
3,High School Themed SciFi,"It wasn't that bad.....it's just that it was really aimed at kids so, it was not my cup of tea.Typical....bully picking on geek.....hero gets the girl....redeems geek etc.....just with cheezy aliens. :-)Overall, it was still fun to watch.Acting - 4 out of 5Special Effects - 4 out of 5Plot - 3 out of 5"
4,surprisingly good movie,"I did not think this one to be that good.Amazing action scenes, great special effects.....Really good.I am shocked about the dumb, simple-minded teenager ""highschool-love""scenes...... Body language and facial expressions of the actors look as ifthey belong into a Melrose-Ave episode.....How in the world can Dreamworks allow something like that to happen?That ruined a much bigger success and a possible multiple-movie series...hope they`ll still do another one......"
4,I'll see the sequel,"Rented it from a red machine, and it exceeded my expectations in part because I read the comments here first and was expecting worse. I can understand anyone's opinion that the movie is lacking, if more was paid.There are enough in-depth reviews, so I'll spare mine. But, I will definitely check out the sequel because I liked the story line enough.And, where can I get my own dog like that? :)"
3,For teens only,"Watch this movie if:1. You have not got enough of the Twilight series.2. you want to have a change from vampires and werewolves to aliens, and good looking ones at that3. you are in your teens4. you are not in your teens but wished you were in your teens... 5. you are in love or wished to be in love6. relive your school day puppy love7. need some eye candy to go with your wine"
4,"good story, lots of action","Good story-line, likeable characters, lots of action. What more do you need from good sci-fi? Ends with the possibility of a sequel."
1,I AM UNORIGINAL,"Guy comes from outer space with a mission, falls in love with misfit girl, saves the day. This film was summed up with the two minute movie trailer. No need to spend money. Seriously one of the Top Four Worst movies of 2011. 15 minutes into the movie, I kept checking my watch to see how much longer I had to endure and suffer before the movie ended. The script was full of cheesy lines, the special effects looked like the film was made for some cheesy 60's horror movie. It's films like this, that make you wish there were evil space villains out there, just so they could put you out of your misery while you suffer through this film."
3,Clark Kent/Buffy meets H2O for kiddies,The main character played byBeastlyPetits Four is part Buffy part John Connor on the run from Terminator. It's a well made film but it's not for grown-ups. The main baddie is played by The Blob from Weapon X and the mystery woman is played by the Australian exciting version of Kristen Stewart.
4,I WATCHED THIS MOVIE WITH MY 14 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER WE BOTH ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH,"MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND I BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, LOTS OF ACTION ETC. WE WERE BOTH HAPPY THAT IT DID NOT CONTAIN SEX/NUDE SCENES LIKE SO MANY MOVIES DO TODAY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES, THIS HAS PLENTY."
2,Lacks cohesiveness and overly ambitious,"""I Am Number Four"" is an action science-fiction thriller with an interesting premise. Number Four (Alex Pettyfer) is an alien whose home planet, Lorien, was destroyed by an evil race of hit men called the Mogadorians. Four is one of nine Lorien children sent to Earth to escape their planet's destruction. Legend says that they will eventually gain enough power to vanquish the Modadorians. So the Mogadorians have tracked them to Earth, intent on wiping out all nine. One, Two and Three have already been killed. Four must act quickly and decisively, but first he must hide in plain sight. How? By enrolling in his local high school.This movie is all over the place and far too ambitious. Sometimes it aspires to be ""The Matrix,"" other times ""The X Files,"" and still others a John Hughes flick. Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Combo Pack include a making-of featurette, bloopers, and six deleted scenes."
5,Great Action and Story,It is really nice when I and my wife and teenager can all go see a movie and all enjoy the heck out of it. This was an excellent movie well worth seeing. I hope they make a sequel. Good family fun.
3,Sci-fi horror,"Grown up Alex Pettyfer demonstrates wonders while saving the world from allies.Personally, I am not in this sort of horror sci-fi but better than nothing as entertainment system was at last repaired for a few hours left before landing."
1,Not worth paying for...,"I did not enjoy this film in the least, and I'm generally pretty forgiving about films and like this genre. The storyline was jumbled, and the acting was terrible. Too bad really, since it has so much potential."
2,An empty shell of a movie,Perhaps the book explains more. This movie left me wondering why and what was going on. I was was certainly not expecting Citizen Kane here but if you pick a movie like this to watch a little more substance would be nice regardless.
2,Lifetime Teen Movie,"The only part of this movie I liked was the dog. If you want to watch a good show with teens, watch Buffy. Buffy is way better. Better acting, much better script, lots of humor and suspense. This movie could have used a little humor, and I got tired of Sarah. I wanted Number Four to get up with Number Six, and Sam to get up with Sarah."
4,I'd like to see sequels,Well played. Good movie for teens and older ages. I would like to see sequels. Maybe what happens when all of the surviving numbers get together.
3,"Action good, Story good","All around fun movie. For me it wasn't a movie to see over and over again. For a rent, it was fun and worth the price."
3,I am #4,"Really great story line, hope there is a sequel. They had some great special effects but some really slow and boring parts..."
4,I am four,Watched the trailer and that was enough to get me to watch the movie. This is not a deep movie but what I like to call a good popcorn flick. Alien boy learns what his superpowers are and falls in love with the girl. This is a basic plot but fun to watch the process.
3,Really?!,"I read the book I am Number Four and loved it so when I found out there was a movie about it I was excited. In the beginning I was amazed at the detail but as the movie went on events were skipped, things were rushed, even key things in the book were absent in the movie. The movie itself was okay if not a bit confusing. However, the book to movie transition was terrible. I was very disappointed with the movie but recommend picking the I am Number Four book up and reading it so you can really appreciate the story line."
4,Liked it a lot,I hope there is a sequale for this one. I liked it . Too bad Timothy Olophant will not be in the future ones.
4,Pretty good,"This was a good enough translation of the book. I like the story. Liked the actors and the SE, too. I got this for Christmas."
2,The book is better,This dvd was ok. I feel that the book was much better. I liked the action starting right from the beginning. There did seem like there were some gaps in the story but not as bad as to not make sense. Probably not a movie I would seek out to watch again but it is good for the teen age crowd.
4,Great Original Movie,"It certainly isn't a thought-provoking mind bender, but an enjoyable 2 hours nonetheless. It helps it's original and not a remake of something else (as so often is the case with this genre). Enjoy."
2,Was Hoping for More.....,"As I am sure with many reviewers of movies whom have read the book - I was hoping for more along that story line contained in the pages. The video just didn't drag me in the way the book was able too. Not enough backdrop and the life the ""aliens"" had left behind to completely gring the viewer into the picture of just why they were there and what the reasons for same were. The acting is acceptable more focused for the teenage crowd. I felt that with a little more aged theme the movie could have come across much better. Have read the sequel ""The Power of Six"" and enjoyed it as much as the first - but will not be waiting with baited breathed if a movie sequel is made."
4,Much better then I expected,"I rented this movie to have something to watch while I ate. I really wasn't expecting much, just a little entertainment. I was pleasently surprised. The plot was as expected, however the acting was very good, the special effects were good and the movie left me feeling good. Plus I own a beagle...Overall the movie is a very good hero movie."
4,Great Movie. Not As Good As The Book,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.. So much so that I decided to read the book after it... The book itself is amazing and I can't wait to read the other sequels to it.. This movie was very different from the book as far as the action scences.. Either way I did enjoy the movie just wish it was a little closer to the book.. I hope they would make sequels but I don't think it made enough money.. Action is great, Acting is great, I think everyone should give the movie a try then also read the book after.."
3,Interesting Concept,"The movie had an interesting premise, which my husband and I (as lovers of sci-fi/fantasy) enjoyed. The movie overall is nothing to write home about, but if you are desperate for something to watch you won't hate it."
3,My initial reaction after watching the movie,This movie was a good telling of a story. It had a good pace about it; not too fast or too slow. Some characters could have been built up a little more in substance/background. A few parts were juvenile and since it didn't take itself too seriously that was ok to.
5,"Thrilling, With Very Scary Bad Guys","I'm amazed at how many reviewers disliked this film. I found itgripping right from the get go--the ""aliens at war witheach other on earth"" theme starts in the very first scene. I didfind the young hero's stubbornness irritating; he's the sort who,when you have to get away *now* just stands there. There are plentyof twists in the plot, special effects, and all that suspense stuff,so even if you aren't grooving on the plot, you won't be bored. And--this is NOT a spoiler--make sure you take note of the girl whosets something on fire early on without any explanation. It paysoff later in the action."
4,Very good movie,"I wasn't expecting much, but I love scifi and it was 1.99 and you know what it was a really good movie. If you're into scfi it's worth the watch."
4,SEQUELS PLEASE!!,"I must admit I had my doubts when I rented this video ""I Am Number Four"", but no doubts remain anymore! This is an excellent, well put together action, thriller, suspense movie, it is all in there even special effects! I am like a lot of others who have done reviews on this, I hope they make several sequels!! Love the Beagle dog, #6, and Sam, in this, watch it, you will see what I mean! If you like aliens, and people with super-powers in movies, you will like this!"
3,I am #4,A good plot but overall not something that I would watch again. Many elements in this film seem out of contexts of the plot. Basically a kid flick.
5,great movie,"It has action, romance, comedy this movie was great to watch if u like sci fi movies or super hereo movies u will dig this. Number four is an alien who has super powers who parents died on his planet an had to be sent to earth with a protector."
4,AND I GIVE YOU A 4,"Big, loud and overblown, this Michael Bay production obviously aims for the teen audience in its TWILIGHTish movie. They even throw in GLEE's Diana Argon for good measure!Is I AM NUMBER FOR a great movie? Not really. Is it enjoyable? Yes, it entertains with its chaotic action sequences and good special effects. Like other reviewers, I question the kill in order motive, where's number five..etc.Alex Pettyfer looks good but doesn't have a very wide emotional range, but I'm sure that's not what the producers wanted. Ms. Argon inherits the Kristen Stewart role admirably. Reliable Timothy Oliphant does well with little to work with. Kevin Durand's Tim Curry impersonation is fun and Jake Abel's jock is appropriately smarmy.Director D.J. Caruso handles the movie well and hits his target audience.Ultimately, it's enjoyable and a sequel inevitable which will probably feature more of Teresa Palmer's hot #6!"
2,Not an action movie. It is a high school love story with a guy who has power to use gravity to fight.,I am not great movie at all. Lets just say this is a horrible high school drama crap movie with a 30 min action scene. Not the greatest movie to spend 3.99 on. I just did not enjoy this movie. I have to say that the special effects look nice other than that its not that great. Its a waste of time even to read or write a review for this movie. I am writing this review for the people out there. This movie is like a huge mix of Twilight and any super hero movies which did not come out that great. The squeal might be better than this since the book seemed a lot more interesting than the movie.
1,Really poor script,"Some of the special effects are entertaining - butthe characters are underdeveloped and the story morethan predictable. Overall, NOT a movie worth seeing."
5,Entertaining and Nicely Put Together,I wasn't expecting the greatest film of all time when I watched this but it turned out to be very entertaining for a sci-fi blockbuster. I like how the story unfolded and the acting was not poor. If anything this had much more substance than Twilight in terms of character development and plot so the influx of negative movie reviews are surprising to me.
4,Cool sci-fi movie...accept it for what it is,Don't over analyze and accept this movie for what it is. It's not trying to be an Academy Award winner. It's just an entertaining sci-fi at it's best with great special effects and cool story line. Can't wait for the sequel.
2,Don't care about a sequel,The lead actor is supposed to be in high school and looks nearly 30. I laughed at some of the bad dialog and acting. The last 10 minutes were ok. The first 90 were yawn-inducing.The bully in this movie turned good-guy in 10 seconds. This whole thing made no sense. I realize it's fantasy. But at least give me something to hold onto.
3,Decent movie,"I remember the critics' opinions being very neutral to negative about this movie. I found it moved a bit slower than necessary but otherwise is was moderately enjoyable. I felt like I got what I paid for - no more, no less."
4,Good,"The dvd played well and it arrived within the time frame. I'm very happy with it to aid in my ""I Am Number Four"" series collection."
4,Better than I expected,"I watched this because my husband wanted to. It isn't really one of the genres I usually enjoy, but it actually was better than I expected!"
4,Very Enjoyable,I have watched this movie on two different occasions and have enjoyed it both times. Sheer entertainment for me. I would recommend this to anyone interested.
2,Nothing new here,So predictable in the first few minutes that I couldn't watch all of it. Nothing new or exciting here. Movies like this are a dime a dozen.
3,Good adaptation,The movie followed the book to a certain extent but as with all movies they thought they could improve the original and failed. If I had not read the books I would have given the movie a higher rating but because I did I am going with 3 stars; Hollywood needs to learn to leave the books as is when filming if possible and in this case it was.
4,The Stuff works!,"i have used this product for a few years now and it works great.i usually put a few tablespoons in when i transplant things or get new plants and it really helps them take off to a good running start.the espoma name is well known and respected for a reason, give it a try and stand back!"
1,What is this guy doing- writing his own reviews????,Is Mr. Shubin writing his own reviews? I guess it shows just how crazy he is?
2,Bronson in a differnt kind of role,"I just watched Somebody Behind the Door for the second time. The first time was about 12 years ago. This movie has a good story and is worth seeing. It is a bit dated now. You can tell it was shot on a low budget. But it is an interesting concept. Anthony Perkins is his usual creepy self with a twist as he manipulates a mental patient under his ""care"". Jill Ireland is beautiful and Bronson is... well Bronson (menacing). This is a stretch for Bronson from his usual macho revenge rolls but he holds up well. Its worth a look."
4,man behind,as always charles bronson at his usual best.his acting is is good as ever.you can always get a good film.
3,so-so,"I an a big Charles Bronson fan, but this was really not one of his better movies. His acting is very good, so I think it is the story itself that is not great."
2,Good book - don't bother with the Kindle version.,"First and foremost, this review is about the Kindle version of the product and not about the paperback one. When I started learning Spanish, I found this book to be very useful as a basic grammar for beginners and helped me to progress greatly. A couple of years later though I made the mistake of buying the Kindle version to brush up on my Spanish. Unless there is a new version of the product available, I would strongly advise you not to do the same. The book is essentially a scanned PDF of the entire book, which means you can't take notes with your Kindle nor search for a specific section. What good is that to learners who want to brush up on a specific section of grammar or have a particular query? Furthermore, it is horribly formatted as the publishers don't seem to have adapted the paperback format in any way.Simply put, spend your money on a paperback version or on a product adapted for Kindles."
2,Hard to Understand!,"I find this book extremely frustrating. It does a really poor job of explaining things. Half the time, I can't even understand what it's trying to say (and I'm an A student in Spanish). It's also poorly organized. Very disappointing!"
2,Not the best book...,"Not the best book simply because it gives the examples of the WRONG things to say. I.e. the numerous ""Avoid the Blunder..."" text boxes which each include several examples of what NOT to say, with crosses next to every one of them. Sorry, but I think every time I peruse this book, the incorrect phrases are being drilled into my brain. I would like to see the correct way written alongside the blunders.As such, this book is the last one of my small collection of spanish books that I would choose to pick up and read. Yes, in all honesty, I haven't read it... but that's why it deserves only two stars. For that reason & that and it is too advanced for me."
1,NOT IN GOOD CONDITION,First I want to say this is a great book I give it a 100%. It was a used book which was not problem at first until I recieved the book. The seller said good condition my rating for the used book is on a scale from 1-10 it was a zero. The cover had dog ears the book looks like a dog played with it. The book also had been written in. I was totaly shocked because the person did not tell the truth. It said good condition. I have bought things from Amazon and it has been great this was a person who sold their item on amazon . First time buying a used book because it cost less. My sugestion is to only buy new books. If you dont care about the condition. I like my books in really good conditon and from now on I will buy new books. I rather pay more from Amazon and get a new book then to buy used from a seller using amazon to promote their productThanks
5,This book will help you correct your Spanish Blunders,"While I do think the author should change the box that says, ""Avoid the Blunder"" to ""Speak Like a Native Speaker, Say..."" and then list the correct phrase(s) to say, the content of the rest of the book is excellent. The author clearly states the rules to follow and gives good examples. The book is well written and comprehensive. To get past the minor shortcoming of the book, the reader can pencil in the correct way to say things into the blunder boxes so they're imprinted in the reader's brain. I also learned a lot from reading ""Pitfalls of Spanish"" but I find this book to be more comprehensive and with more numerous examples.Jade Lindquist'Finally Learn Spanish' podcasts by Edufone"
2,"A mi, no me gusta este libro","I have been studying Spanish for 5 years or more, and am always looking for another book to help me improve. This book may be beneficial to some.....it depends on how your brain is wired. This book has a highlighted box around each ""blunder"" while the correct way to express the Spanish is not highlighted, and in fact, at times can be difficult to find in the paragraphs preceding or following the highlighted blunder. So I am blinded by the glare from the highlighted blunder, without being able to see the correction. I agree with a previous reviewer: I feel that the errors are being cemented in my brain, not the correction. This is the only Spanish instructional book for which I have ever wanted a refund. But I own it now. I keep picking it up, thinking maybe this time it will help me. Then I put it down, thinking that this book and I really do not get along. Good luck to you, but I would not buy this one."
2,I Agree That The Book's Presentation Is Not Great,I never liked books that point out the wrong things. That is because you will remember those things more than the correct things as one reviewer rightly pointed out. I remember going to a cashier's training for spotting conterfeit money. Rather than show us conterfeits they made us spend hours examining genuine bills and later tried to throw in some conterfeits and they were easy to spot because we were so used to the real thing. That being said the book could have been made more effective by having more emphasis on the correct way to say these things and de-emphasis on the incorrect way of saying the same things.
1,fails to capture the fun of the tv show,"very limited game play opportunity. maybe it's just me, but i never thought of this show as an opportunity for a video game. how exciting is removing a bolt for an entire minute (with a little graphic on the side showing how far out of the car it has traveled)??just like the show, you have a set number of days and set number of tasks (buying or cannibalizing and installing parts with a budget) to complete the build. you control 3 team members plus jesse james. unlike the show, you just rip the car apart and put the new parts on before the days run out. just as a guage of interest, my kids spent 10 minutes on this game and spent the rest of the day playing ""need for speed 2 - undeground"". i would not recommend this game at all. it's very poorly done."
1,doesn't work with Mac,"This game was advertised at Mac compatible, but that was not the case, had to return."
5,fantastic,"This cd is fantastic for about 5.00 dollars you cant go wrong with a from rush song , to better off with him ,the art of making sense, this cd is great.No fillers here either just straight ahead high enery rocking ,great song writting and playing .I recomend them highy to anyone who wants to try something new they really grown alot since their first album ,and you can hear that in their music .Try them the a ,iam sure you will give them a a allso .I hope this review was helpfull to you"
2,radio for GBA SP,"great radio but does not work well when your in the car moving it's good in a solid area does not work on GB, GBC, GBA, only on GBA SP."
4,Good advice,"I find that this book is simple, and to the point in it's approach, but has a wealth of information. Very beneficial for those who are first generation college graduates, or raising that first to be college graduate. Helpful in building that foundation that many Blacks are still trying to build/re-build."
2,Common Sense,My favorite parts of this book were the autobiographical details. Itfs always interesting to read how a father raised his children. The rest of it was mostly common sense and easily found in the headlines and commercials of popular culture. Do your homework. Socialize with people who do THEIR homework. Support and discipline your children to the aforementioned ends.
3,Very simplistic book,"This book does provide some useful tools, but I thought it was often overly simplistic. The most helpful section - which does not apply to me - was the section on dealing with anger and your children. I would recommend the book for that section to parents having this problem."
4,WOW!,"I was reaaly impressed with the song entitled ""I Must Go On"" it was absolutely wonderful and beautifully written. I also really enjoyed the songs by Daisey. Overall, if you like freestyle, old school freestyle, then this is the CD for you."
5,THIS IS A MUST FOR FREESTYLE LOVERS,"This CD brings out the essential flavor of what romantic freestyle is all about. The producers did a great job of giving us that same flavors that they once came out with "" in a dream "" . If you loved the 1st one youll love the second one ."
1,words can't say how BAD this is...,"""Galaxy Freestyle Compilation II"" Is the final nail in the coffin of played-out freestyle. Metropolitan Records has some awful freestyle compilations but this lemon really takes the cake. A friend of mine showed it to me in his ride and I was astonished at how cheesy and syrupy the songs were. You already heard the same music in Volume one- just imagine the same ol' samples and tired out chord changes rehashed for a second helping... My friend literally THREW the disc out the window when we'd heard enough! I know there's not much new freestyle coming out these days but trust me- SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
2,Sex is not as simple as Hirshman makes out,"This book represents another step in the reduction of human affairs to legally arbitrated exchanges and misses the unique quality of sex. The very power of sex lies in its connection to a hoped-for reciprocity, a spontaneous and unstoppable expression of passion or love. Such an expression cannot be compared to, for instance, the exchange between a merchant and client. In such an expression there is no buyer and seller, personal walls break down. Hirshman's humorless account of sex does violence to the emotional and spiritual experience of the act, missing, in fact, that it is not an act at all, but an event."
3,It's ok.,This cartridge is nothing to get excited about. It is as good as the generic stuff. It gets all the 3 stars that I have for this product.
1,Disappointing,"This album was extremely disappointing. It sounded like the Hot Boyz ""Get it How You Live""(which was actually tight) all over again. The artists used the same lines on different albums. Not recommended."
5,louisiana rap,"im from louisiana, and have been listening to all the local music for a long time, this album is one of the top ten rap albums to ever come out of this state, Lil wayne, one of the nations top rappers, spits some killer verses to some of manny freshes best beats, apperances by the other ""hot boys"" members can also be found on this album which features the rap talents of manny fresh and bryan williams before they went all comercial and screwed up cash money records, because in my opinion, after the release of juveniles ""the G code"" and B.G.s chopper city in the ghetto, cash money just went down hill, but if you get all the stuff that came out before that, you may throw away any other rap CDs you have, because between UNLV's uptown4life and lil waynes the block is hot album, cash money, song for song, is right up there with death row"
3,good album,"The big tymers were decent in this album. This is the best two non rappers can do. Throughout the album is good songs and beats but their lyrics get so repetive. Cars hoes and money by halfway its gets bad but with the cash money gang making appearences on most of the songs it is good. All the songs are good but track ten is stupid, mannie fresh can't sing at all. U can't go wrong with the album unless you are looking for deep lyrics cause this ain't it"
3,A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING,"THIS DISC IS A SLEEPER. PEOPLE ARE REVIEWING THE BIG TYMERS AS HORRIBLE RAPPERS BUT THESE ARE TWO GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS GAME FOR 8 YEARS NOW AND ARE SIMPLY HAVING FUN AND TALKIN ****. THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN'T RAP, BUT NEITHER CAN MASTER P BUT YALL LUV HIS ****. SO WHAT'S UP? BESIDES THE MEAT AND POTATOES OF C.M.R IS THE HOT BOYZ AND THERE ISN'T ANY GROUP OUT HERE WHO CAN TOUCH THESE TEENAGE SOULJAS. bUY THEIR DISC YOU'LL SEE"
4,Has its moments,"This soundtrack has its moments. The final score, ""End of another year,"" captures the mood perfectly (as, incidentally, does Dumbledore's speech). I love the scores for the wizard competition. While Doyle isn't John Williams, he adds to the excitement of the film."
4,getting ready for Harry Potter Death hallows,"Harry Potter sequel rus in my house every so often. Its nice having all the DVD, from beginning to end and on Amazon, the used copies are as good as the new copies. (I don't often buy new DVD)."
3,Falls Short,"I must admit that when I first heard the score for this movie, I was disappointed. It simply just didn't ""capture the magic"" like the three previous scores by John Williams. I am not attempting to say that Patrick Doyle doesn't have talent, his musical creativity for this movie was good. But it's just that, good.I think that while watching the movie, the music will lend its compliments, but I do not see myself humming the tunes in my head. In the end, it simply falls short of John Williams utter magical ability with music. But then again, who can truly match that?"
4,Surprisingly good,"I was both shocked and disappointed to see that John Williams had been ditched and replaced with a new composer for the music, and was sad to see that this new guy for the most part rewrote it all.Despite all this however, I really enjoyed what was done and really enjoyed the remix of the Harry Potter theme. I'm sad it wasn't used more.All in all, the music was good enough that it made the movie seem much more enjoyable to me, which is saying something since The Goblet of Fire is by far my least favorite of the group."
1,"actually, negative 8","hey, it's not 2 bad. but not good at all.puh-leezpatrick doyle has nice music for other movies, just not harry potterjohn williams is my favorite composer, and will always bthe music really doesn't fit with the moviei think the 4th movie would have been much more popular if the music had just been better"
3,i'm so sorry...,"first i gave 5 stars for this album and pre-order it 1 month before but when i realized that John Williams is not tbe composer,i really got angry and sorry... also i watched the film and i can say that i didn't hear the music... in first 3 films,music was everything... it was givin' the magic.. but now it was really boring.. John Williams was feeling magic and givin it with his sounds.. but now Harry Potter lost one of his souls :( i'm really sorry..."
1,Yawn!,"A very dull offering, especially after the best soundtrack in the series and the best thing I have heard from John Williams in quite a while. If you want a good Harry Potter soundtrack, get Prisoner of Azkaban. Skip the others, especially this one. It has no dynamic range, no imagination, and no emotion."
1,"""Hated It!""","I am sorry to disagree with you all, but I HATED IT!!! The music didn't flow with the movie at all. In fact the movie itself didn't flow. I have nothing against Patrick Doyle, but I think I would have liked the movie alot more if John Williams had done the music. I know composers sometimes need a break when doing films like these, but in my opinion, If you do the first 3 movies, you must be commited and do all the movies."
2,Bland,This score is lack luster compared to the previous by John Williams. I didn't know Williams was not the composer for this film until I went to see. The music from this soundtrack is uninspiring and unmoving. Compared to Azkaban this is just background noise.
1,WHY??,"Why did John Williams stop writing the music? All I can say is that I hope he returns for the next one. This soundtrack is a waste of time to listen to. Don't buy it. The movie was very good, so I had higher expectations for the soundtrack. However, I was to be extremely disappointed. This soundtrack doesn't even come close to the first three films' music."
1,John Williams. . . .where were you??????!!!!!!!!,"I was sorely disappointed in this soundtrack. I was looking forward to hearing John Williams once again as I sat down to watch the movie. I was looking forward to the musical journey that Williams always takes you on. His music brings deep impact and brings a ""magic touch"" with it. This soundtrack was a dud; I was not moved in any way. I just sat there and thought to myself, ""Is this it?"". I really hope they bring John Williams back for the next Harry Potter movie."
2,Harry Potter GOB Soundtrack,"I think that John Williams should have written the Goblet of Fire soundtrack. I was disappointed after listening to Patrick Doyle's soundtrack. It lacks substance and that Harry Potter magical quality that John Williams has always given us. After all, John Williams is a musical genus."
4,Mostly good,"I was disappointed to hear that John Williams didn't do the score for the forth in the Potter series, but I have to admit that Doyle, et. al. did a great job. The music captures the spirit of HP4 while still being true to the themes originated by Williams in HP1, 2, and 3. Some of the pieces are quite powerful, somewhat reminiscent of the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack (which is a must-buy).If it were not for the three Weird Sisters songs at the end of the CD, I would have given it 5 stars. But these three tracks seriously detract from the CD's overall appeal. It's like mixing AC/DC with Beethoven; they both have their place, but not together.Buy the CD then re-burn it to another disk leaving off the last three tracks."
5,A GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!,"Even though John Williams didn't do anything with this soundtrack, this was a very well done soundtrack and I don't and won't regret buying it. It's a great soundtrack and do listen to it on a ragular basis."
2,The new guy...,"I actually don't have this soundtrack, and will never buy it. Why? Because I really, really dislike the music in the fourth movie.I saw the movie of course, and spent quite a bit of time hissing to my friends, ""What's the deal with this music? It's like a daytime soap or something! Where's the Harry Potter theme?"" I stayed to watch the credits, and, sure enough, John Williams has clearly disappeared.I work at a movie theatre, and I must say that the orchestral music at the end of Disney's ""Chicken Little"" sounds more like Harry Potter music than the music at the end of the Harry Potter film.I am not happy with this new music at all--it actually distracted me from the movie."
4,very good indeed,"Overall, Patrick Doyle's composition was great, he's very good at representing darkness through the music. And the three vocal songs from the Yule Ball were great. (If the music wasn't played during the Yule Ball, I would have hated having this music. There is no place for vocal music in the background for this type of film)My only gripe about the soundtrack is that John Williams theme is nowhere to be found. I understand that the reason for having a new composer is to come up with new themes for various things, but the main theme that is so recognizable as the Harry Potter theme by everyone who's seen the films should not be cut out completely. For this reason alone, I had to mark down the soundtrack, but if I could have given it four and a half, I would haveI haven't seen the film as of yet, so if the theme is still in the movie, I apologize. I'm going by what I heard on the soundtrack."
5,Musically Spellbinding,"This album is a must for an Harry Potter fan, both young and old, from the mild to the extreme. I also recommend the entire collection of soundtracks to the movies. Each one is full of calm, soothing melodies we have come to enjoy from Harry Potter."
3,Okay..................................,"I'm a very, very, very, very, very loyal Williams fan, and I will remain so. I'll say that some tracks are good, but Williams will always be the best Potter composer ever."
5,Great Music and Great Film!!!!!,"This score is better than any of the pervious Harry Potter Scores/Soundtracks!! John William's music in the previous Harry Potter films had gotten too repetitive. Each film had become almost the same soundtrack with a few changes, basically cut and paste. I personally love how Patrick Doyle takes the original Harry Potter theme but changes the accompaniment/chords to give it a new dimension in this soundtrack. This soundtrack is intense and is a must have! Patrick Doyle couldn't have done any better!"
4,... Delectably Different ...,"When I heard that John Williams wasn't doing the soundtrack quite frankly I was relieved. After listening to the music for the first time it was like a breath of fresh air. Don't get me wrong I am a big fan of John Williams. his music just is always obviously JOHN WILLIAMS, and it is really hard to get away from that. I like how Patrick Doyle changed things around and did his own thing. It is a very well composed soundtrack and is definitely a must-have."
5,Doyle at Top Form!,"I'm sure stepping into the shoes of John Williams is enough to give anybody a case of the jitters... However, Doyle manages with such grace and elegance that one wouldn't notice. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is not just a great score, it's a masterpiece of classical music that I'm sure Doyle is very proud of. Unlike his successor (Hooper) Patrick Doyle chose to take the Potter series an entirely different direction with a sobering and dramatic work. While tracks like ""Harry in Winter"" pull at the heartstrings, ""The Yule Ball"" and it's like are pure classical bliss. Also keep your ears peeled for Doyle's reworking of ""Hedwig's Theme"" which sounds very akin to a Bohemian/gypsy tune mixed with a gothic flair."
2,Please Mr Williams come back,"After seeing this movie and owning all the other soundtracks for Harry Potter I added this to my Christmas list. Upon opening presents I realized I could not recall the music from this film, which was not the case with the others. Now I know why. Without John Williams at the helm this music is empty and disapointing. It's just not Harry Potter-ish. I have nothing against this composer and am sure he is very talented. Just not for the Harry Potter movies. Mr Williams who is a musical genius did all the Star Wars movies so why not these? Not going to be playing this CD very often."
4,a little short of my expectations,"I had very high expectations for this film soundtrack. I loved Patrick Doyle's work for Sense and Sensibility and others. I like the Quidditch World Cup track and Foreign Visitors Arrive, but I found myself liking the Prisoner of Azkaban Soundtrack much more. The good parts of The Goblet of Fire Soundtrack are very short and I wish there was more of a theme throughout. I'm not sure it's worth the money, but parts of it are enjoyable. The movie is good, go see it!"
4,Nice Score!,"I was disappointed when John Williams was not going to write the score for this movie, since he is one of my favorite movie score composers. It's sad that Patrick Doyle only uses the original harry potter tune a couple times in the whole movie, but his score is also much different from the past 3 Harry Potter movies. I think it should also be noted that the UK version of this soundtrack includes 3 bonus songs, including the song sung during the Yule Ball scene by the Weird Sisters."
3,Unremarkable and Unmemorable,"A big change from the previous three scores, The Goblet of Fire is a dark and heavy score with little of the whimsy and fun we've come to expect. That's not necessarily a bad thing as this is a much darker story than what has come before. It's just too bad that this score doesn't leave much of an impact. After listening to it four times through, I still have a hard time recalling any of the new themes. It works well enough in the film, but it's just not that fun to listen to on its own.The last three songs are preformed by the Weird Sisters. They are loud rockers with lots of screaming and goofy lyrics (Runnin' like a hairy troll, learnin to rock and roll). Frankly, I plan to never listen to them again."
2,A disappointment...,"This score regrettably fails to deliver. It has some good (and on occasion impressive) moments; Patrick Doyle's score will most likely work better with the film. Unfortunately, as a standalone listen, it never reaches the complexity and emotions provided by John Williams' compositions."
3,"Different, but still okay...","Though this soundtrack doesn't have the same magical qualities as the John Williams soundtracks, I thought that Doyle's work still did the job. Just as any other soundtrack, it has its ups and downs, but I think, all in all, it was adequate.This film represents a transition from the old Harry Potter to the more mature, more graphic stories. I think that another fanciful John Williams soundtrack would have been inappropriate for this change.The action sequences were a little humdrum, but still appropriate. Neville's waltz was particularly effective. It played throughout the entire portion of the film during which the students (and teachers) were preparing for the dance, and the music created a soothing mood rather than playing on the awkwardness of the characters.Overall, it was a good soundtrack, though not one likely to go down in history."
3,Fell short,"This fell short of magical almost entirely. The whole thing is either dark or intense and when there is a soothing section it's sounds almost depressing. Plus the three lyrical songs suck. The guys they got to perform them have no talent. And, even for the wizarding world the lyrics are aweful. I recommend sampling some of this before you buy it. I know I will for the next one. If this is what surrounds the new world of ""Harry Potter"" the next one is going to be Dark and Depressing most of the time. If you've read the books, then you know what I'm talking about."
3,"Not bad, just not great","Patrick Doyle is very talented - I own other soundtracks that he has done (Dead Again, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing) and consider myself a fan. However, this score just doesn't seem to have the same resonance as those done by John Williams.It isn't just the CD on its own - I had bought but not listened to the score before I saw the movie, and during the movie realized that none of the music had made an impact on me. It feels the same when I listen to the CD. It is good music, some of Williams' themes can be heard at times, in other areas the themes are reminiscent of Doyle's other work. But I've listened to it about five times through, and now I'm going to listen to ""Azkaban."""
2,Okay,"Fine in the film...bland on CD. Divorced from the film, Patrick Doyle's score simply cannot touch the sense of wonder, anticipation & magic that John Williams pours into the previous three scores. It's just is not very interesting to listen to on it's own. I guess that's the difference between good and great."
2,Let's wave the wand and bring John Williams back for the Order of the Phoenix.,"While Doyle is a fine composer in his own right, there simply is no comparison to John Williams. Subsequently, the discerning Potter fan will no doubt agree that this soundtrack is subpar. Music often helps make the film as Williams' scores did for Potter- this score does not. It's just there. Here's hoping that from these ashes, Williams rises next time with the Phoenix."
3,Disappointingly pedestrian,"Let me start by saying I sympathize with Patrick Doyle. Yes, a Harry Potter composer is a great gig but you have to follow three soundtracks by John Williams. Doyle has a quite respectable pedigree of smallish British films to his credit, BUT this ain't ""Sense and Sensibility"". You have to bring it up a notch. Unfortunately, like the film itself, the soundtrack feels to episodic; as though there are pieces missing.Goblet starts off promising: ""The Story Continues"" is an excitingly dramatic opener that deftly weaves in ""Hedwig's Theme"" and hints at Elfman-esque grandeur. Similarly, ""The Quidditch World Cup"" and ""Foreign Visitors Arrive"" are solid tunes but from there the album devolves into atmospheric music in search of a film to accompany. Several of the songs ARE pretty in a pensive way, but its just too little."
5,what a great tape deck!,"for those of you looking for quality at a good price, this is the way to go. I began building my home theatre on a shoe string budget. After the TV, the speakers, the tuner and the DVD player, I was a little tapped for cash to spend on things like the tape deck. However, we all need one. So, I got this one from amazon. Its proved to be indestructible and very reliable. I've had no problems and it even survived being left in a snowstorm by my moron room mate. it still works like brand new! and the price, you cant go wrong. ... ! save some money and get a good tape deck!"
3,not exactly as expected,"i bought two pairs of these pants for work. i previously had two pairs that lasted a couple of years (also as work pants). the string color on this page is NOT khaki. i, unfortunately, assumed it was khaki since the only colors listed were black and string and the pants pictured are khaki. string is quite a bit lighter than khaki, almost approaching cream color. the pants i had before seemed thicker than these (which is helpful when they are work pants) and not quite as long. my old pants were a 9/10L and fit perfectly...these are the same size, but are much longer for some reason."
3,Nice but a little short,"If you're tall or borderline (need a 32-34"" inseam) then these pants are not for you. I can wear 32"" inseams with flats, but prefer a tad longer so I can wear them with 1-2"" heels. These were barely long enough when new, and after the 1st wash--forget it. Other than that, they are comfy and look nice."
4,True Fit but not short,"What is ""short""? I know it is variable, but I don't think a 5'9"" woman is short. These jeans are nice and fit well, but they are about 5"" too long for me (I'm 5'4""). Their style is such that they don't look good rolled, so I'm off to the cleaners to get them altered. Therefore, I haven't worn them yet, so I cannot attest to their wearability/washability.Otherwise, they are very nice."
1,frumpy pants,I ordered a size 1 and they are huge. The do not look like the picture featured and they look more 80's style. I will return them tomorrow.
3,I wasn't aware of the MONO,"It sounds really good. The only thing that threw me off, was that it only worked in one ear/ear-bud. With a little tweaking of not letting the jack go all the way in the socket, makes up for the stereo sounds I was looking for. It's not a bad buy, but the wire is fragile!"
3,you get what you pay for here,it performs as well as the radio shack $39 mic. not professional audio unless you have a way to cut the noise but seems to do ok
2,didn't work that well,Bought this mike to go with the amplifier to stop feedback when turned up loud enough to be heard. Didn't work any better. Feedback was just as bad.
1,Does not work on Laptops,I could not get this microphone to work on a MAC PowerBook Pro laptop or an IBM ThinkPad laptop. :-(
2,It's a mono microphone.,I bought the Microphone because it was linked to the Olympus WS-300M Digital recorder and recommended on the web site. Unfortunately it is a mono Microphone and the recorder is stereo with an excellent stereo condensor microphone. I did not need an external Microphone the ME-15 was a waste of money for me.
2,Not that great,"Simply put, this mic has slightly worse sound quality then the one built into the Olympus VN-5200PC (and I suspect most of the others). It is not remotely directional and can be expected to pick up the same sound whether you are pointing it at your subject or not. In other words, in a noisy room you can expect to get sound salad from everything more than 4 inches away from it.The only situation where it would be usefull is one in which you need to have the mic close to your mouth and for some reason can't pick up the 1 ounce digital recorder it is plugged into."
5,Works well with laptops,"To improve dictation for Dragon Software, I got this crystal clear microphone to use in place of my built in microphone. Use to have a Bluetooth Plantronics, but this wired tie clip is easier to use and never dies. XD"
3,"A little pricey, but definitely better than the OEM that came with my recorder","I purchased this to replace the entirely inadequate microphone that came with my dictation recorder. The length is superb and the swivel clip allows you to attach the microphone neatly under my tie, or shirt collar. Excellent background noise reduction and no static detected."
4,Not bad for the price.,"If you are looking for a professional high quality lav mic, this is definitely not it. The sound is actually quite good but the volume is down compared to other mics. For my purposes it was perfect. The tone was good and I will be only using it occasionally, so for me it is great. It was for a video interview and I had to put the voice track through an audio program to bump up the volume and then it was very good. The volume is really the only issue."
2,Great When it Worked,"This was a great microphone when it actually worked. The sound quality is pretty amazing for the price. However, this isn't the most durable microphone. I was able to use it for 3 or 4 video shoots before it just stopped working all together. I take pride in caring for my equipment. I don't believe its lack of durability was affected by the way I treated the microphone. As I was always sure to put it in my camera bag immediately following use.One day I attempted to plug it in for a wedding I was shooting. I did a test, as always, before filming and it just didn't work.Very difficult to find a durable wired microphone as I have been through 2 other mics that stopped working shortly after or immediately after purchasing them.If you need a mic for a shoot or two and don't mind wasting $25 buy this mic. If you're looking for something more durable, good luck."
4,good deal for the money,I do a lot of Wedding videos and needed to use my digital voice recorder on the groom for the best sound. This mic worked great! The cord is just the right length and is easy to hide on the groom. The only thing I wish it had is the clip that comes with it is chrome and sticks out a lot on a Black Tux. I change the clip to a black one I had and now you can't even see it on the groom at all. The sound quality is very good. This work great for me and is a lot cheaper fix for a mic and a digital recorder on the groom then a Wireless $200.00+ set up.
1,Piece of rubbish,I purchased this mic and it hasn't worked from the minute I pulled it out of the box.How hard is it to supply a basic microphone that doesn't arrive Dead On Arrival? Rubbish. Took it to my local video store to confirm its worthiness and they confirmed it was dead.Very disappointing.
4,Clear as a bell,Works great. Only draw back is I catch the wiring once in a while and catapult the mic to the floor. Ooops.
3,Good but needs stereo Adapter,This is good clear mic but needs stereo adapter. Great price for the sound quality.
4,"Works Great, But...","I bought this for my Olympus WS-311M.The mic works great; good fidelity and eliminates the rustling noises produced when handling the recorder during record; but it plays back in mono to ONE channel only.You will not notice this when listening on the recorder's speaker, of course, but will hear only on either left or right side with headphones/earbuds, etc.The recorder has stereo record capabilities, so they should have designed the plug to input both channels, eliminating this playback annoyance."
3,Not a stereo microphone,"This is an attractive little microphone but the specs do not mention that it is mono, not stereo, and I did not notice the image of the mono jack in the photo. Monaural recordings play back in the left ear but not the right, breaking symmetry."
5,Works very well!,"Good mic! Records in mono only but that's all it promised. Picks up sound well, even at meetings. Nice to be able to clip the mic in place, too."
5,deal or no deal?,"I bought this mic. based on a special offer given when I puchased a sony ICD-SX-750 voice recorder. The digital recoder itself, nevertheless, contains nice built-in microphones. With this ""extra"" Olympus mic, sound qualities are even better! The voice coming out is just like you are talking in an acoustic studio and noises from the ambient environment is further reduced. I am very happy with this device!"
4,Olympus ME-15 Mic,"The ME-15 not to be confused with the ME-12 (which has no cord) is a great microphone to use with a digital recorder. It is very sensitive which is good if you are in a group and want to pick up comments from others (it will). The cord is pretty long, but not a major issue. I don't like the alligator clip since it can damage your clothes when you attach it. I would suggest putting a piece of cloth on the teeth of the clip to prevent it from poking holes in your garments.The clip can not be moved up or down so the mic is pretty much where the clip is. For the price it was a good deal since I did not want to hold the recorder (RCA) while speaking and it had no way to clip to your clothes. Overall I am very satisfied."
4,I think its OK,"The price is reasonable.I did not get a good recording where I initially wanted to do it, such as in class or in a piano practice room, but it's probably because of my fault, since in class I couldn't place the microphone right in front of the instructor. Also, the practice room is small so that sound reflects too much. In addition, the rocorder I use is Olympus VN-2100, which might not be a perfect recorder.Still, I can't find a good digital voice recorder with a microphone that records better than my old SONY Mini-Disk rocorder/player with no external microphone. WHY....?"
4,Good but,"Great little mic, but when played back, sound only comes from 1 speaker, because the plug is mono. The stereo mic is bigger and cost more, but for about $2.00 you can get a mono to stereo plug adapter at radio shack. That makes a big difference, and sound now comes out both speakers"
4,"Clear sound, nice clip","I bought this to replace my headset, since I own a nice set of headphones I'd rather use when audio conferencing (generally Skype through my computer).The first thing I noticed was the short cord (3 feet long). You'll almost certainly need an extension cord if you aren't using the front/top mic jack on your desktop or a laptop. The clip swivels, which is quite nice, so you can clip it anywhere and still point it at your mouth. I generally clip it to my headphone wires or my shirt.Volume was a bit of an issue. This is my first time using a clip on microphone, and I had to max the microphone volume on my computer to get adequate sound out of it. This was more of a problem with the Linux version of Skype than the Windows one. The microphone is fairly directional, so talking into it helps.Audio quality is a big step up over my previous no-name brand headset, and everyone I talk to mentions how much clearer I sound.Pros:-Nice clip-Clear soundCons:-Pricy-Short wire-Low volume"
2,Not a quality item,"You get what you pay for. The Olympus ME-15 is a small, lightweight lavalier style microphone. The cord is just three feet long, which makes it too short for most uses except recording your own voice. The mic is omnidirectional (picks up sound from all directions), which means it's pretty useless except under very quiet conditions. If you use the attached clip, the mic has a tendency to pick up extraneous sounds like clothing rubbing against it. If you don't use the clip, your fingers can cause annoying extraneous sounds, too. Bottom line, it's compact and works as designed. It just isn't designed all that well. And for the price, I suppose that's all you can really expect. I'll keep it as an emergency back-up travel mic, but it's really no better than the built-in mic on my Olympus 300M."
5,pretty handy!,"This is a pretty handy little tool to have when conducting interviews, or if you just don't want to hold the recorder up to your face 24/7. Would definitely recommend the product. It improves sound quality immensely!"
1,Bad Idea,"This is NOT an authorized Britax car seat cover. Real Britax covers are cuter,cheaper AND safer! Get the real thing!"
3,"Prefer last years ""regular"" Mom's Plan it","I love the 7 spaces. A space for each of us AND one extra for pets. However, I was very disappointed when I opened the box. There is no ""hanger"" as there was with the 2005 and 2006 calenders. And I was quite surprised to see that it was Christian based. There was no indication of that in the description. I was also sad to see there were no tabbed paged in the back for phone numbers and kids contacts. Overall, I think I prefer the past 2 years models. Had I known all the above, I probably would not have purchased this. I think I'll go back to buying my calenders at the book store so I can physically look them over."
4,Best. Koala Slasher. Ever.,"This ain't Australia! Only from Japan could we get a 6ft. psyko-ala bear. This killer furball ain't playing around!The cute cuddly dude's name is Tamura. He's your basic suit and tie business exec that has some serious 5 o'clock shadow. Beneath the grey fur he's a pretty nice normal guy.But one day his beautiful girlfriend turns up dead, and he is the chief suspect. Tamura is forced to enlist the help of his boss(a white rabbit) and a nearby convience store clerk(a frog).This is of course some silly arthouse cinema, but it is often hilarious. These large hairy creatures are integrated pretty naturally into society, and nothing is ever explained.I'll admit, I was hoping to see some sweaty girl-on-koala action, but no such luck. Phooey! Plus the bloody carnage and campiness was much less than I expected, which was a tad dissappointing.Still there is some nice koala kung-fu fighting and good satire. Not bad.FINAL GRADE 3.5 Stars, rounded up for originality."
4,Great Price,This is a nice above-average home theatre speaker system. Thesatellites are fairly powerful and easy to hide if necessary. I agreethat they do lack the midrange of the more expensive systems. I replaced the center channel satellite with an Infinity center channel speaker (this is by no means a must). The small subwoofer offers plenty of punch. The only really bad thing I can say is that I have had trouble with the speaker wires. Three of the connectors have gone bad. It's not easy to replace them since they are JBL-type connections. If you can't spend $1000 then I would recommend this system to anyone. END
3,Okay performance at a VERY cheap price.,"My roommate purchased these speakers and I must admit that I was very disappointed with the sound when listening to music. I much rather listen to my car audio system for music.I rented a couple of movies and took the time to adjust the gains, delays and tune controls on the receiver and was suprised with what I heard. When used for home theater, it is actually a good system. Not as good as another friend's Klipsch but it is less than HALF the price.If you are budget minded and already have speakers for music, this system is a good home theater system."
1,Don't buy for music reproduction.,"This system is at best adequate for Home Theatre in a smaller room. The center speaker, the identical match to the front and rear satellites is devoid of ability to reproduce understandable dialogue. For music, this system is totally lacking in any mid range. A big hole is left in the sound stage mid ranges between an OK tweeter and very boomy bottom end. Do not be fooled by its good looks and solid construction, for even the best amplification will not hide its shortcomings."
1,Poor Quality,"I have the crib bedding to match this cover and the bedding is fabulous. However the changing pad cover quality was very, very poor. The polka-dots were only on the side of changing pad - the top was all white (can you say dirty) and the fabric was very thin. I returned it immediately."
4,super cute,got almost this whole set for my daughters room and its super cute. changing pad fits good
5,The best book I ever read,I have now read and re re-read this book many times.It shows how she transformed the British economy from the poorman of Europe into the rich man of Europe.This should be compulsory reading in schools.
4,Very Interesting,"I bought this book after seeing ""The Iron Lady"" film. This book gives you a real feel for what was going on in the UK in the 1970's. I also learned several things regarding the parliamentary system of government that I found very interesting."
3,A Decent Memoir,"A Decent Memoir, June 28, 2004This was a decent read, though I think that Lady Thatcher hastily wrote it as a prequel to the more celebrated ""Downing Street Years."" That being said, it was interesting to read about her rise from backbencher to Conservative Party leader. In grabbing the reigns of Tory leadership, she toppled a mindset that accepted Britain's economic decline as being part of ""the natural order of things."" She also offers insights on the European and international scenes during the middle to late 1970s. On this, she criticized the idea of detente as being a recipe for disaster. The memoir ends with Britain's so-called Winter of Discontent, which propelled her into Downing Street."
4,Excellent Book! Interesting from Begining to the End,"This book is quite attractive, has a nice cover & would make a very nice gift, or addition to a library. The print is also large enough so you probably won't have to ""squint"".Anyone who has the faintest interest in politics, or the structure of policies & politics in Britain will find this book quite facinating. Margarets' autobiography is quite detailed, and depicts her life from childhood to her ""primping & priming"" for her Grandioso role as the ""Iron Lady"". What's even more gratifying is the fact that there are some great photos of family, friends, and also other political figures within the arena.A book that will interest you from the begining, to the very end. ."
2,Not nearly enough of what I expected,"This otherwise well-written book spent way too many words telling me about what food and liquids Mr. Wilson ingested during his days and too many flowery descriptions of the sunsets and other things he viewed out the window.I wanted to know much more about his initial training (almost no information provided about that), the operation/maintenance chores of the tractors and trailers (some of that provided, but not enough) and the financial aspects of being a long-haul trucker (very little mention of that). Also almost completely missing was information about the well-known sordid aspects of truck stops.Mr. Wilson seems to be a fine writer and should know his stuff about trucking so I'd ask him to write another book, this time mostly about what he omitted from his first book."
2,Disappointing,"This book could have been interesting, but was written in a boring diary format that desperately needed some polishing with the help of a professional writer.Being a former truck driver I can tell you that the world of OTR trucking is a bizarre sub-culture of America. The average person would be very surprised, shocked -- and a bit scared if they knew what goes on out on the highways, in the rest stops, and in the truck stops of this country. And watch out after the sun goes down! Truckers rarely speak of this as it portrays the profession in a bad light, but sometimes the truth hurts.Wilson could have written about this sub-culture, but instead wrote incessantly about the most boring and mundane parts of the job. I have no doubt that Wilson was one of the few who did not take part in this renegade trucker behavior; however, he could never convince me that he did not see it."
3,Journeymen,"The problem with being a journeyman group is that, no matter how good you are or how much you grow, you tend to have the same stalwart fans. Ocean Colour Scene were overrated when they first happened on the Britrock scene, but they got better and better from then on. Problem is, most U.S. exposure was to their Faces-like debut, and the taste of the time was not for blues-based rockers. Too bad. Because OCS's last release, Mechanical Wonder, was wonderful. And their latest, with its long and awkward title, is almost as good. Their rockers are good here (if unspectacular), but its the ballads where Simon Fowler shines. ""I Love You"" is as grand and simple as its title. And -- here here -- it's felt, not processed like so much other rock and roll on both sides of the Atlantic."
5,Castanets are all that I expected these to be!!,"I bought these castanets for a costume, and really like the crisp sound these create. Check out videos on you tube and ivillage.com to pick up the basics on how to play these castanets!!"
4,Confused,Well they are good quality but I'm confused by the fact that one says f and the other says m also the strings are both very different lengths !!!
3,Too tight in the back,"I ordered at 36D, and I know the size is correct, this bra however was WAY to tight in the back, so I have to return it."
4,The little heater that could,"As others have noted, this heater is smaller than I imagined, but it does a good job of heating up a 14X14' room on cold days.When I first turned it on, I noticed that the fan did not produce much force. I actually thought it was broken, but after a few minutes my room was warm.Also, as others have noted, the unit is well-built and solid. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is I feel the fan could be a bit more powerful."
1,Worked amazing until they stopped working altogether,"I loved these heaters - I purchased 2 of them. They are so stylish and smaller than many other models, but yet worked so well. They heated a room faster than another heater I have that is twice the size. However, we only ran them each for less than 2 months when they both just stopped working. The first one went out and I thought it may have just been something I did or a flaw with that specific one, but then about a week later the other one did the same thing. I'm so upset because these were amazing, but they are not worth it if they die out so fast. I didn't move them around a lot or treat them harshly, one sat in the living room and the other in the foyer. Very frustrating. I have a cheaper sunbeam one I bought at Walmart over 3 years ago that is still trucking away working fine, but it just isn't as pretty as these ones."
4,Great little heater!,This heater warms up a chilly 11 x 14 room in just minutes. Wish it had a timer though.
3,only good for personal heater,"Don't buy this Sunpentown SPT SH-1507 if you are using it to heat an area its only good for personal heater. Heat comes out ok but very poor projection only 2ft after that you can't feel anything. Using this unit in 10x12 bathroom it does not do the job at heating it you can't even feel it unless you are next to it. Not what I expexted, I don't understand why so many people rated this high."
3,"Very cool, but smelly and color isn't exactly what you think","Summarizing some of what I read before purchasing, the pros are great: very compact, very quiet, pretty amazing how it can heat a small room like it does. The cons are that it still has a bit of a smell to it (less over time--I hope it isn't bad for anyone's health!).I don't know if this one was mentioned: all photos I've seen on it (including the packaging it comes in) make you think it is white and orange. The base color is truly ivory/offwhite and the orange is befitting of the 70s (kinda muted). The worst color is the light orange on the top panel. Would be really great in true white and intense orange!The two I ordered had the same odd tape job on the box edge. I believe that's how they come from the manufacturer--the repackaging would've been very expert if they had both been returned and you'd guess that the tape would be different (both were clear packing tape)."
1,Terrible!,"I received this heater the other day. When I opened the Amazon box, I noticed the tape on the outside looked odd and like the box was part of a return from another customer. But, I thought a return could be for more than just damaged. I plugged in the heater and it worked for less than 60 seconds. Now it doesn't even turn on. This heater might work fine normally. Why I'm giving this 1 star is that this company sent me out a heater that had already clearly been returned by another customer. And, I'm no rocket scientist, but I'm guessing they returned it because it didn't work. Poor practice to send out broken product."
3,"Purchased in Feb, died in Oct","This was a great little unit while it was working. We took it out of storage and the heating portion was working, but the fan and ocillation arent.Strike 1Not wanting to overheat the unit, we unplugged it and looked up the warranty information. We've contacted SUNPENTOWN and we find out that we're required to ship the unit back at our expense, even though the website advises a year warranty.Strike 2I'm hoping to get this unit repaird and back in my hands before winter comes in too cold. Lets see how timely the service period is. Will update when this has been process is finished."
2,Inadequate,"I have a 200 sq foot RV and this might heat about 30 of it. If I heat the RV with propane, this little heater will sustain the temperature but it is pretty worthless for raising the temp more than 3 degrees. After a year of use, it seems to have gotten dirty on the inside and shuts itself off frequently due to overheating (I presume). Other RV owners swear by their small space heaters of lesser cost that this one."
3,It's ok but needs to be taken care of,"This heater worked pretty well for the first month. It was very quiet and the oscillating option is nice. However after that the fan stopped working well and the device got overheated really fast. Now I realized it was because of the filter being obstructed, but this is the first heater I need to take care of such thing. If you keep the filter clean it is still a nice device."
3,Works sort of....,"Worked well for the first few months; have it warming up the area around my computer desk and it handled it well until last month. It began shutting off automatically after anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour. I'd then turn the dial to 'off' and perhaps 15 minutes later I'd turn it back on again and go through the same process all day long. When it worked properly, it was an excellent little space heater, but now, it's just about useless."
4,"Great, for small spaces","The greatest pro: very quiet (I have had many heaters in the past, since I have cold feet, they were all noisy. This one exceeded my expectations in that respect) . Also stylish looking.Con: Good for small areas. Like my bathroom.I will certainly recommend to buy it!"
5,Perfect for office,"I bought this heater after reading reviews on Amazon and other websites. My office is too cold. If I wear a skirt in the summer, I have to go outside to warm up every couple of hours. I needed a heater that is small and quiet enough that nobody would notice when I hide it under my desk. This is just the perfect one! It is not bulky at all, and the noise level is well below my expectation. I can only hear it working if I put my ear within 1 feet of it. Otherwise, complete silence in my office. Very happy with my purchase so far. Don't know about the quality yet, but I hope it will last a while."
3,Without a thermostat it's kind of stupid,"It doesn't matter than this unit only draws 600W on low and 1200W on high...without a thermostat you're just throwing your money away if you intend to use this while you sleep because your room will become too warm. Instead, get a heater that has a higher wattage but also has a thermostat so your room is warmed up only as needed. Such a heater may draw more power while it's on but it'll be off most of the time, whereas you're burning a constant 600W the entire night with this heater."
3,Disappointed,"I like Sunpentown appliances in general. I bought two of these this after reading the reviews. I sent one to my mother in law before I tried it out. First, seems well built. As mentioned in other reviews the knob is slippery and will be hard for someone with arthritis to use, such as my mother in law. The fan is very weak. The heat comes out ok. I am sending it back. Probably will send hers back also. Very disappointed.Update: I asked my Mother in law to try it and she liked it so much she kept it. Same with my wife. I told both I could modify the knob but have not done so to date. Because they like it so much I am upgrading the rating from a one to a three."
3,"Excellent heater, but limited lifetime","This is an excellent heater - it puts out very hot air, and looks very sleek. However, the lifetime is limited (mine just now kicked out, after a year of use), and the problems I'm experiencing now prompted me to write a review to shed light on the poor manufacturing. Obviously, a heater at this price is indicative of oriental manufacturing, so I took it apart and attempted to repair it. What I found was the most unimaginably poor soldering job I've ever seen for the control knob. It must have been the assembly line worker's first day on the job, because it looked like child's work (and by my previous assumption of oriental manufacturing, it's possible that it is literally child's work). But seriously, how hard is it to connect a button and a four-state dial to a heater?Anyways, I'm more ballsy now than I was a year ago, so I'm going to make the plunge into a more expensive, more reliable heater that will hopefully last longer than this one."
2,Disappointed,"After I read all positive and negative reviews, I decided to buy this product because as noted in many 5 star reviews, it could provide enough heat for a room. Well, the unit is functioning but its heating capacity is very poor. As long as you are within 1 meter diameter from the unit, you can feel the heat. Otherwise, it is a waste. I don't understand how people say it can provide enough heat for a 12X12 bedroom even with a vaulted ceiling! Are you kidding me?"
3,Not thermostat in this unit,"There is contradictory information regarding the temperature control on this heater. I want to confirm that the unit does NOT have any built-in control for temperature. I verified this with the manufacturer. It generates heat as long as it's on setting ""1"" (600 watts) or ""2"" (1200 watts). I like the unit, it's pretty, it's quiet, and it heats my 14x14 home office so well (even at the lowest setting) that I unfortunately have to return it because I simply do not want to keep turning it on and off. Like another reviewer said, I wish they included a thermostat: that would be a winner."
2,Does its job so far but shoddy construction,"I've been using the SPT SH-1507 for a little over a week, and it does a reasonable job pumping out warm air. However, it has already started intermittently making a very annoying rattling noise, a testament to its cheap construction, I suppose. I expected more given its price."
2,Not great even when it works.,"A poor fan plagues this heater. After a minute the fan reaches top speed, which provides such weak airflow you can barely feel it at a distance of 2 feet. After a week, the heater began shutting off after a few minutes. I suspect the fan is not strong enough to push the heat away from the unit, causing an overheat malfunction."
5,"Very quiet, bit ugly but so far works great","I've had it a few months and it's whisper quite, puts out nice heat and is space-saving. Has a re-useable filter and a lower (preferred) 600W setting. Most are 900 on low, so that's a nice feature if you just need a little heat.My only complaints are: No thermostat and the power knob is a bit slick, should be textured so you can turn easier. I'll get out the fine sandpaper to fine tune it.I'm ordering another one soon! Had purchased another supentown (tower style ceramic heater) and it pooped out after a week. This one seems to be simpler and fool-proof."
4,"Patience, Its great little heater.","I thought I bought a dud at first, like a couple reviews I noticed right away the fan wasn't pushing out air as much as I would have liked, it seems on high the heat gets higher but you can hear the fan speed slow a little. This heater isn't about fan speed though. Leave it in a room alone for half an hour and you'll see what I mean. It can get straight up toasty if you leave it on high all night, I've had to wake up several times to turn it off. For the price it looks good and works great. I have been noticing some discoloration in the orange 6 months later though."
4,Great small heater,"It works great, not noisy, and looks great. If I buy another one, I will buy this one. It is a bit expensive in my opinion. So, I will give it a 4 star."
3,A Little Bit Of Heat,"I bought this unit for my basement. It does not put out enough heat to warm up an unfinished basement area. It will warm up the area right in front of it, and the oscillating feature is very nice. I have since purchased a Kenmore oscillating ceramic heater from K-Mart for about the same price that did much better of providing warmth in our unfinished basement."
1,Did not even last a season.,I loved it when it actually worked but burnt out half way through winter. This item is not worth buying. Just don't bother.
4,does the job well,"I researched quite a bit for a space heater for my toddler's room as safety was my number one priority, and this is the one I settled on. It is a bit pricey because you could get one that does the same job for $15-$20 less but it doesn't get too hot anywhere on the surface and it has a shut down safety feature if it got too hot. it also has a shut down feather it the heater is knocked over by accident.it heats up 14x14 room reasonably well even though i only use the low heat (600 watts). My toddler doesn't keep the cover all night but still stays warm.I wish it had a thermostat so it didn't run all night but i try to make up by lowering the main furnace by couple degrees. Also, i wish the fan had little more power to it. Other than that I am satisfied with the product."
2,Did not last long,"We used this from time to time, and it lasted nine months -- several of which were summer months when we did not use it at all. It looks good, and, when it worked it was fine. But who wants to buy a new unit every six months?"
4,Kool Looking Heater,I really like this heater. It looks really cool and it does the job (for a small room). It's perfect for a small room.
3,Excellent Quality But Lacks Adjustable Thermostat,"First, this heater is very well made. I only removed a point because it lacks an adjustable thermostat and it's a bit expensive even at $45. Yes, I should have looked at the specifications more closely before buying, but I'm still not disappointed in my purchase. Personally, I like the temperature around 60 degrees F, not the default 68 degrees F. It's a compact heater and most owners will appreciate it's usefulness around the house."
1,Broken Failure,"We were having trouble keeping our toddlers room warm enough at night, so after reading about this product on another website I decided to pick it up. Like another review I just read, the box was all taped up when it arrived, so it looked like it had been returned previously by another customer. After having it on and working for about a minute, it just completely died on me and there are no signs of it recovering.I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product and its manufacturer. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
1,Lasted about 3 weeks,We typically buy a new space heater every year. Comparing this to that last 15 or so we have purchased it was the worst.
2,Smell,"I like the compact size and how no noise it makes.But it has very odd burning smell when it's on. Is it just me? The package box was taped around... I am suspecting restocked item. Seller, any help?"
3,It is working for a small room and with a little noise.,"Length:: 0:19 MinsThe unit does its job in my study room with the door closed (about 10x11), not in the living room with high ceiling (I lives in New England). If in the living room, it only heats the area near your feet.The other thing I don't like is the noise. It is not very quiet, though not that loud to bother me during daytime. However, if you want to use it during sleep at night, then you won't have a good sleep."
2,Return to Sender,"Our experience is similar to that of others who gave this heater a low rating. I like the looks and size of the unit and both of us are incredibly impressed with its quiet operation. Even in the oscillating mode it's hard to tell if the heater is even on.But...The control button on the unit's top is stiff and not easy to turn.Though the heater puts out decent heat, air flow is anemic. One has to be within inches of the heater to feel any air blowing from it.Worst of all the heater shuts off spontaneously and doesn't come back on for various waiting periods. Since the unit was intended to keep Mrs. Spudman warm while she smokes in a very cool room, the spontaneous heater turn offs are a turn off for her.The heater is being returned to Amazon while I search the listings for a replacement."
1,Doesn't work correctly - frequently doesn't start up or shuts down quickly,"From the time I received the heater, the fan never ran properly. It sometimes starts up and within a minute or so the heater will shut down and won't start up again until I let it cool down for half an hour or so. Even then, it is hit or miss whether the heater will work."
1,"Don""t Buy, it will died on you","It worked ok in a small room on the high setting, not useful on the low setting. After three months, it just stopped working all together. No purchase price is worth the value of something that last only 3 months."
2,Not a good choice.`,We have been using this for a few weeks now. It takes too much time to throw any heat at all. We are using it in a fairly small room. It stopped working two times now. We tried to plug it in later and it did come back on but we are worried it is going to stop working altogether. We are planning on sending it back.
3,"OK for the money, but don't expect too much","This lift is adequate for occasional use by a do-it-yourselfer, but is certainly not professional quality. The drwyall sheet wobbled a lot when the lift was extended to 9 feet, not enough to be dangerous but enough to require that some care be taken. It's cheap and it works, but you need to be careful with it."
5,Fantastic!,"This book is a ""must have"" for any school or home library. It is part of the fantastic series by Linda Glaser that takes a close-up look at many of nature's creations.The book provides a wealth of information about the Monarch, with many additional details in the back of the book for readers (and their teachers or parents) to explore further.The wonderful text in this informative book can only be surpassed by its fantastic artwork! The beautiful images by Gay Holland are like photographs, only better. They show you wonderful details in the close-ups: much closer than most of us can ever get to one of these amazing creatures!If you have or know of any children in the appropriate age range, or are purchasing for a school library, I HIGHLY recommend this book! Even my adult friends who have read it find it fascinating!"
5,Get it read it,I have been in sales for over 30 years. I have seen things and people I have no desire to be like or do. This book helps a great deal in working with people I would not normally hang out with........Get it......Read it...Apply it...........jmho
2,what??,Very excited to start this book BUT just did not understand what the writer was trying to tell me. I was disappointed that it didn't deliver any message to me.
3,its ok,"I knew it was a used product, and it works very well, many thanks for the item.I will stongly recomend this Phone."
1,Not Whats up lol,This phone dosent have a camra. they dont tell yoy everything about there phones so be cearfule if you like this phone.
4,One of the best new freestyle artists,"Synthia Figueroa is one of the best new freestyle artists and her ""Dreaming"" cd is a must have for any freestyle fan. There isnt 1 bad song on this cd. ""You Were Meant For Me"", ""Touch Me"" and ""Dreaming"" are 3 excellent songs. Her duet with Willie Valentin called ""Love You Need You"" is one of the best freestyle duets Ive ever heard! I also love her remake of ""What Will You Do"". And her remake of ""Will U Still Love Me Tomorrow"", a classic song, is really nice. I recommend this cd to everyone...especially all the die-hard freestyle fans out there!"
2,Wake up!,"I got this album a few months ago after hearing that it was good. The truth is, this cd is actually another good reason as to why latin hip-hop dance music is struggling. I gave ""Dreaming"" 2 stars (and I'm being real generous) only because of it's commercial releases which tricked me into purchasing this piece of garbage. What's a shame is that Synthia has a good voice but she's constantly singing the same played out, predictable lyrics over played out, predictable beats. This cd hits its lowest point with an extremely agonizing and corny cover of ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"". Save your money, just get the singles."
3,"Great Idea, mediocre execution","I really wanted this item to work as it is a great time saver, however, my 25' Craftsman tape measure has an end that was too thick to fit in the groove of the SpeedRocker. It would fit but would need take some effort. Well after about 3 days of intensive drywall cutting and somewhat forcing the tab of the tape measure into the groove, it bent the two body pieces apart enough (that is to say less than half a mm) that the blade no longer opened and shut properly. I'm not sure if this is a design flaw or just a product or perhaps an incompatibility with my tape measure. I had to return it to the Blue Borg where I got it from and finished the job using a fixed blade knife.If they changed the design to better lock the body securely this would have gotten 5 stars no problem, the feel of the tool (LOVED the large thumb pad area) and the utility of the drywall saw and rasp was awesome."
1,Dangerous,"I saw this in my local home improvement store thought it might work well for me. I do alot of sheetrock work so I bought this tool thinking it will save time and I would have to carry less tools in my pouch.One day I was using the saw to cut an outlet and my grip on the tool pushed out the razor blade which i had just replaced and it sliced open the side of my pinky!!!!! Needless to say, but it is now in the dumpster.Extremely poor engineering"
3,Not what I expected,"The photo above is deceptive. This tape is 1/8"" thick and 1/4"" wide. From the photo I thought it would be wider."
2,Maul or Sledge Hammer?,"I have split firewood with an eight pound splitting maul for 13 years and love it. My son, who is 14 wanted a lighter one so that he could split with me so I bought him this one. It does have a nice handle but the head is pathetic. Neither one of us could reliably get the thing to split logs. One of us would swing it and it would just dent the log. I would switch to my eight pound and the log would split. I compared the two and there is not nearly as much taper on the the Truper six pound as there is on my eight so I took a grinder to it and tapered the head to match my older maul. The maul splits like a dream now.If you're having trouble getting this maul to split consistently try having more of a taper ground into the head, something Truper might want to do from the factory."
2,all crust/ no lobster,"IT HAS BEEN 14 MONTHS SINCE I HAVE HAD THIS DISH.. BUT, I REMEMBER CLEARLY, THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE LOBSTER...THAT SAID, THERE IS SOMEPLACE WHERE YOU CAN GET A LOBSTER PIE WITH ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT GUANTIED..."
1,Unbearably pretentious and superficial,"Like many others, I hoped this book would offer me another satisfying glimpse into the McCourt family. However, my husband and I, both obsessive readers, could not stand reading beyond the first 25 pages. The writing style was cute, but the narrative totally lacked substance."
1,No body likes a drunk,"I read through to the end hoping to reach justification for having done so. Malachy is a sad, wretched man and now I have his filth filling my head. I currently seek a Malachy McCourt lobotamy. He wants sympathy from his readers for not having had a father growing up but there will be none from me for this whore-monging, egotisitical sop. I'm sure his children are so proud. (The gracious one star is for his good writing skills.)"
1,No body likes a drunk,"I read to the end of this book hoping for justification in having done so. Malachy wants sympathy from his readers for having grown old without a father but this whore-monging, egotistical sop will get none from me. I'm sure his children are so proud. (The one star is for the good writing skills.)"
2,"not great, but a fun read",Malachy is clearly tied to his brothers coattails. A Monk Swimming has none of the nuances or poetry of Angela's Ashes; Malachy seems to have learned nothing from his misspent life. But he tells his tales (tall and otherwise) with wit and charm.
2,I was disappointed with this book,I must say that I missed the humor in this book. It appears to me that the author is trading off the popularity of his brother. The best writing was on the last two pages.If the author had written his book with the same feeling as these pages it would have been an excellent piece of work.
2,"Congrats, Malachy! You've made a quick buck!","I was one of many who first read Angela's Ashes, and then moved on to A Monk Swimming. Having siblings myself, I realized that the two books would most likely be different. What I didn't expect however was to have to slog through a couple hundred pages of name dropping, stories of macho bar hopping, fighting, abandoning wife and children....for what? To help Malachy make a a few dollars by riding on brother Frank's coattails! Granted there were moments of hilarious humor too real to be made up, but I would not have missed a thing had I NOT read the book! One would appreciate this book only if one appreciates hearing tall tales and name dropping whilst imbibing SEVERAL stouts in the local bar! My advice: skip the book and wait for the movie starring Malachy as himself."
3,"A delightful tale from this ""Angela's Ashes"" younger brother","Although his spelling is atrocious (He says `sez' a lot), Mr. McCourt depicts his adventures colorfully. He describes a life full of highs and lows, bouts with depression and alcoholism, love and heartbreak. His voyages make a truly wonderful story. In fact, I am in love with him. Is he still alive?"
2,"Entertaining enough, but disappointing","Malachy McCourt certainly has a way with words, but I'm afraid his adventrues are not all that riveting, and the few tantalising glimpses that we have into other aspects of his life are not fully developed (for instance, who is Diana, to whom the book is dedicated with such love?).""Angela's Ashes"", by big brother Frank, is far superior."
1,A Rip Off,This book was a rip off. I felt as though I was Malachy's latest victim in his con game. Can I rate this book lower than 1 star?
2,Clever phrases can't excuse Malachy McCourt's sordid youth.,"Malacy McCourt isn't the writer his brother Frank is, although he can sometimes turn a clever phrase. However, his facility for language can't hide the fact that he spent his early days in New York engaged in boozing, whoring, and illegal activity. Perhaps we're supposed to find his antics amusing or cute, but to me this is a tale of a wasted, squalid life. Since the book ends somewhere in the 60's, I smell a sequel coming, wherein I'm sure Mr. McCourt has an ephiphany and turns his life around. I won't be wasting my time reading it, though. Let's be honest--were it not for the success (and rightfully earned success) of ""Angela's Ashes,"" would anyone care about Malachy McCourt or his book?"
3,"M. McCourt is not F. McCourt, so don't compare, just read!","C'mon, haven't any of you reviewers ever read P.G. Wodehouse's books? This is a good (not excellent) takeoff on old Plum's style of writing - an Irish version as it were. This is where the comparisons should be made, not with brother Frank McCourt's style. Frank is subtle and graceful, Malachy is heavy-handed and raucous. If the reader has a brother or sister, he will recognoze immediately that no two siblings view the family in the same way. The point is, BOTH VIEWS ARE VALID."
1,A Drunkalogue From An Expert Practicioner Thereof,"Anyone who has ever attended a 12 step meeting will recognize A MONK SWIMMING for what it is, a typical ""drunkalogue."" McCourt regales the reader with tales of binges and betrayals intermixed with a healthy dose of name dropping. He talks of illegal acts (gold smuggling) as if they were something to be proud of. He seems to think that he's cute. I happen to think that he's not.His brother, Frank, has written a very good book. Malachy should leave the writing to the writer in the family and stick to his day job."
5,Let Malachy McCourt show you the town.,"Malachy McCourt's book had me captured in the first two pages by his turn of phrase and lust for life. It doesn't get any better than this. His surpasses most memoirs of his generation by the force of his personality, wit and use of language. I suffered due to the fact that I didn't want to put the book down and I didn't want it to end. A Monk Swimming brought to mind the fine adventures of Art Buchwald's New York tale, but McCourt's storytelling is an unsurpassed read. I was on the phone after the laughing my way through the first few pages imploring my friends to join me and Malachy as we ""hit the town"". What a joy. Don't miss out on the fun!"
1,Let me save you some time if you haven't read this book yet...,"Here's the deal: Do you enjoy poorly written books about constant drinking, boorish behavior, and sexual athleticism that left me wondering if he wasn't a candidate for constant STDs or worse. Egad, this was bad! AND lots of namedropping, but don't look for interesting tales of these famous men, because there are none...just the names of those he met and drank with. What a total waste of time, ink and paper. YUCK!!!"
2,A major dissappointment after reading Angela's Ashes.,"On the coattails of his brother's classic hit(Angela's Ashes), A Monk Swimming by Malachy McCort is a singular dissapointment. This memoir can be summed up as a superficial glimpse into an arrogant Irishman's experience getting laid and drunk in America. I wish I had spent my money buying 'Tis by Frank McCourt, instead. However, I gave the book two stars because I'm Irish, too, and can relate to some of his humorous midadventures."
2,Reader must assume the role of a bartendar,"Granted - there are a number of very witty lines in this book, and I don't doubt that I'd find Malachy quite hilarious were I serving him in a pub. However, this book has no depth and seems extremely egotistical - no plot, no theme, just the constant rambling and repetition that is known all too well by anyone who has loved an alcoholic."
1,Disgusting,"I don't consider myself a prude, but I found A Monk Swimming to be a disgusting, waste-of-time book about a drunk and a womanizer with no redeeming qualities. Some humor in spots, but they were overshadowed by the unpleasant escapades that he endulged in. 'Tis a shame that I write this after enjoying his brother's book."
1,Very dissapointing,"Enjoyed Angela's Ashes and had hoped that Malachy had some of the talent for writing that his brother Frank showed. However, it would seem Malachy's talents are all inherited from what we have read of his father - he is a drunkard, womanizer and has no education. He even brags that his brother is the only Teacher in the US without a High School diploma. If that is indeed so, it certainly does not show in Frank's writing, but is typical of the sort of down play Malachy makes of all his characters. He appears as a thoroughly dispicable character and his book is not worth the time to plough through!"
2,"Some interesting moments, but McCourt needs writing lessons","Like many others, I loved Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, the brother of Malachy McCourt. I wanted to hear more of the McCourt story. I ignored the bad review in the New York Times.I should have listened to the New York Times.Though the book has some interesting moments, McCourt has trouble describing them. His writing is stilted, awkward, and preachy. That's too bad because there were some good bits, like when he claims to have meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. With better editing and perhaps writing lessons, this book could have been so much better.There is only one reason this book is on the best seller list: Angela's Ashes. On its own, I cannot see how A Monk Swimming could generate such interest."
1,chronic debauchery with no redeeming moment,"Despite the wonderfully colorful, brilliantly whimsical prose, this book was frustrating. I read on and on, enduring the sad path of chronic alcoholism and eggregiously amoral behavior, waiting hopefully for Malachy to reflect some insight or remorse, but it never happens. He must have had friends who tried to intercept this destructive behavior but they are not mentioned. He never brings us up to the present time."
1,"Memoirs of a drunk, a gold smuggler and a philanderer!!!","Whereas Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt was hilarious and heartwarming, the reader felt that Malachy is riding on his brother's successes. This book is severely lacking warmth or regard for humanity; the guy was totally self-centered. In a nutshell, I suppose I don't enjoy reading about a drunken slob. Perhaps if the book had ended at a later point in Malachy's life, I would have discovered some redeeming qualities."
2,A somewhat entertaining but shallow read.,"I was looking forward to reading this memoir by Malachy McCourt, especially after having read (and loved)""Angela's Ashes"", by Frank McCourt. Although I knew when I began the book that it was a completely different book in tone, I was disappointed by the shallow and insensitive narration of past events. Malachy seemed unable to care about anyone around him except in the most superficial of ways (ie, ""the mother""). When I finished the book, I felt less like I'd been entertained and more like I'd been cautioned."
1,He isn't his brother.,"This book sucks so bad that I returned it !! I was expecting something on the lines of Angela's Ashes and what I got was garbage. Malachy saw a chance to ride on brother Frank's success, and wrote a sordid memoir of a drunken failure who spends his life leeching on others. What a waste of paper and my time."
2,"An embarrassment to his brother, Frank.","This is a cheap way to cash in on brother Frank McCourt's success with ""Angela's Ashes"". Even without comparing the two books (and you can't), this book is trash. Malachy boldly writes of drinking, his sexual conquests and more drinking. I thought he had it bad in Ireland, but maybe he'd be better off there, poor. Can't believe I wasted my money on this."
1,Absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . . .,"When I read Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes,"" I was intrigued by Frank's affectionate portrayal of his brother Malachy. So intrigued, that I immediately bought ""A Monk Swimming"" to learn more about this amusing character. What an amazing disappointment. He has abolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. During the course of the book, I found him more and more offensive. I didn't even finish it, and I rarely put a book away without finishing it."
1,The worst book I have read in ages!,"This is the worst book I have read in ages. Not only is it extremely badly written, but it is badly written by a chauvinistic, alcoholic & obnoxious bore with an over-inflated ego."".....in my opinion, there wasn't a party in New York City that was complete without my wit & my exuberance, not to mention my presence.""The content of this book is extremely poor. Malachy has nothing worthwhile to tell & has learned nothing from his harsh childhood.If you liked 'Angela's Ashes', try 'Bridge Across my Sorrows' by Christina Noble. Also about a harsh, Irish Catholic childhood. The difference being that Christina Noble has done something worthwhile with her life."
2,There really isn't much,"in this book. I definitely got the idea that it was published only because of the success of his brother's books. I thought it might be an eye-witness account of NYC life in the '50's and 60's but it is not. He was too drunk at the time to remember anything. Couple a bothersome writiing style with the repetitious re-telling of the same story over and over and you have this book. There was only one story that made me laugh. He finds his hated father in bed with two bald old women. Malachy shakes his dad awake who looks around and asks "" Who are these guys?""That's it - now you don't have to read the book."
2,OK...2+ stars...Enjoy it for what it is,"If you're expecting Frank's brother to have the same lyrical writing style or the same quality, you will be sorely disappointed. Except for the hype, one would not know these two were brothers by the writing. However, at times it is uproariously funny, but the drunken larks and women seem to get somewhat repetitive and tiresome. For the most part, it held my attention, but it's one of those books you could open about anywhere and not have missed that much. Pretty good for a book to read on a plane."
3,"Lighten up and have a laugh, People!","Some of you ""critics"" are far too harsh. You should be reviewing THIS book, not M. McCourt's morals and lifestyle. And you should not be comparing this novel to Angela's Ashes. This is a humorous, bawdy, sad tale of Malachy's life after Ireland. He does not claim to be a good person; nor does he seek sympathy from the reader for his ""bad"" choices. He was a horrid drunk, a bad husband, and a pretty rotten father...but he told you this without ever pretending to be a saint. My only wish after reading this book was to hear how Malachy met Diana (mentioned in the dedication) and finally got his act together to find some happiness in his life."
4,"Yes, there were some low spots but overall a satisfying read","The final chapter of the book, as well as the last two pages of epilogue were worth the doldurms in the middle of the book. The retelling and sometimes glorification of past battles with ""Nancy Whiskey"" I found similiar to most retrospectives. It reminded me of a adult recounting a childhood of abuse. Some fact, some fiction, a little pride, a little humiliation, and ultimately recognition of imperfect life. We should all be so honest. We should all be so free. Tog' go bog e' (""take it easy"" in Irish)"
1,a real ego trip,"IF I HEARD ONCE MORE OF HIS DIPPING HIS WICK AND LEAVING HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AT HOME WHILE HE DRANK THE DAY AWAY AND SMUGGLED GOLD..., THERE IS NOTHING TO ADMIRE IN THIS MAN. HE IS TOTALLY SELF-CENTERED AND THIS ENTIRE BOOK IS AN EGO TRIP. THIS DOES NOT EVEN TOUCH ANGELA'S ASHES........"
3,He kept the book afloat,"I enjoyed this book and feel that it should be given consideration for being a story about Malachy McCourt, not the story of Frank McCourt's brother. I have read a few reviews that belittle the book for not being on the same level as Frank's book. Well this is true but that is because it is written by a character driven man who enjoys telling stories. His life has been transformed into a series of stories and from that this book have arisen. I found it interesting to learn about how society was forty-odd years ago. There were many diferences, yet many problems which stem from similar situations found in today's society. I liked the book and am eager to discover how Malachly's next phase of life was lived."
2,"Trust the others, I didn't; it's not worth it!","I really wanted to read this book, I read all of the reviews, most of them bad. I figured that they were snobs who had read his brother's book. Since I enjoy a good laugh and a light read occasionally I went ahead and bought the book in spite of the reviews. Trust me, they were right. It's not that funny (one LOL), it's mostly boring, talk-show kind of crap. Suit yourself, but I'll admit that I should have listened."
1,This book put the Irish race back 400 years! Sad!,"My own Irishness enjoyed his rapier Irish wit at first--after that fun beginning his book traveled ever downhill. The only reason I continued reading was to find the place where ""until he (Malachy) had no choice but to stop and turn and face his past"" as stated on the jacket cover. Was that part of the story left out? Maybe he's planning on writing a sequel. I'd like to think Malachy grew up. His childhood was indeed horrible, but when he matured (?) he must have sometime realized that he had to take responsibily for his own actions. His ""words"" to God especially sickened me. Glad I got this book from the library rather than putting money out for it. His ""bro"" Frank is a prince!"
1,Waste of time,I should have waited for the paperback - what a waste of time and money. The only thing I got out of it was the proper way to pronounce 'Cead Mille Failte'. I was half-expecting something similar to Hamill's 'A Drinking Life' (five stars in my eyes) but was very disappointed
2,Angela's Ashes-Malachy's Misadventures,"I read this book for two reasons: Frank McCourt's book and Malachy's appearance on an NPR talk show. Unfortunately, Malachy's vibrance and humor doesn't translate from radio interviews to his first book. However, this book was fairly enjoyable because it picks up where Frank left off. The voice of Malachy is distinctive.He lives brazenly while Frank follows a more traditional immigrant route. Essentially, it's the continuation of the McCourt story told through a different family member's perspective. Families (especially Irish ones) wouldn't be what they are without the characters."
3,Intriguingly comical but does not capture complete interest,"Frank McCourt, author of Angela's Ashes is a seasoned writer compared to his brother Malachy McCourt, author of A Monk Swimming. Completing Angela's Ashes and moving on to Malachy's memoir leaves me searching for the type of depth Frank can deliver. It is cruel to make a comparison, but I only speak the truth."
2,A disappointment,"Even though I had heard that ""A Monk Swimming"" was no ""Angela's Ashes"", I was expecting something better. While I enjoyed the author's command of the language and his wonderful prose, I was bored with the constant tales of drinking etc. A somewhat depressing book, and I did not find it funny at all. Sad."
1,Abysmal!,"Wonder what Frank's younger brother Malachy (or is it Malady?) has been up to? He's gone off and written himself a book with the thought that those of us who loved Angela's Ashes will at least pony up the $16.77 to feed what must be one of the all-time big egos. Malachy's book has none of the charm, poignancy or appeal of the elder McCourt's. Malachy bypasses most of the obvious opportunities to write something worth reading, opting instead to name-drop and describe incredibly boorish feats of bravado (disrobing in a restaurant where he was asked to check his topcoat--gosh, was I impressed!). My advice? Readers-save your dough; Malachy-don't give up your soaps."
1,The wrong McCourt,"This hackneyed 12-step ""drunk-a-log"" is a load of Irish tripe. And I say that as an Irish fan of Frank McCourt."
1,Laughing all the way to the bank,"Talk about brand extension! If you weren't cynical about publishers before, you will be now. McCourt can't write. The book collapses after the first chapter. The space devoted to his gold-smuggling career is repetitious filler, not funny the first time around. Who edited this mess? The problem with the book is not that McCourt was a womanizing drunk: it's that he can't make the life of a womanizing drunk sound funny or interesting."
1,A Monk Sucking,"It's a story filled with dichotomies. Malachy continually lauds himself for standing up for the downtrodden yet casually refers to women as ""fleshpots"". He villifies his father by calling him irresponsible, oversexed, drunk. This self-pitying fool seems to be unaware that his actions prove that he is no better, and possibly even worse, than his father.In the back of the book it says that he is happily married. I kept waiting to hear about the love of his life. Instead you'll hear him glorify the mire of his former life.I so desperately wanted to like this book but I found myself doing just the opposite."
3,Makes a good companion book.,"This is a good companion to go along with Frank McCourt's two biography books (Angela's Ashes; 'Tis). However, this book is better than average, but still not a besteller quality book. I enjoyed reading the book because it extended my perspective on the story of the McCourt family. I'm sure any other reader would appreciate the value of this extended perspective."
2,Better Than This,"I wanted to like Malachy McCourt, I met him in Angela's Ashes, and was so glad he'd made his way to the US and a possible fortunate future with food and housing.Malachy McCourt takes all the goodness and prosperity that was before him and drinks it away, just like his father. That isn't reason to give this book a 2 star rating though.The rating is because the book is a shallow account of a shallow man who in writing this book is a name dropping account of his tenuous stardom.The book started of well enough; McCourt can be a very clever writer but it just got so egotistical- how many women he could and did sleep with, how many drinks he could and did drink. how many people he could and did swear at, how many well known people he could and did insult. His writing ability deserved better than thisThe best of the book is to be read in the last part five- Father to the Man. It is heartbreaking and so well written. Would that the whole book had been so well written...."
1,"Fat, Drunk and Stupid","...is no way to go through life.Unfortunately, the time I lost reading this book cannot be returned to me. You've been warned."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME....,"This book is a great dissappointment. If you are looking for the artistry Frank McCourt's ANGELAS ASHES you are not going to find it here. Malachy does not have his brother's gift for words. And who cares about his irresponsible youth all over New York and India?? It is a book that would never have been printed if it was not for brother Frank and his glowing succes with the fabulous ANGELAS ASHES. Take my word for it, don't waste your time with A MONK SWIMMING....please!"
1,Who cares,"I had just finished reading ""Tis"" by Frank McCourt which I was already dissapointed in, but thought a quick follow up of Malachy's book would be an interesting comparison since both were written basically about the same years in their lives here in America. Why would the author think that readers would want to know about every drunken escapade in his life? Every chapter was about drinking, womanizing and name dropping. I did not find anything likable or funny about him. After reading ""Tis"" and ""Monk Swimming"", I no longer felt that pain for either author for their poverty stricken childhood. Neither one of these boys grew into nice men. The chip on the shoulder remains throughout."
1,Don't bother reading this book,Narvel is correct. I should not have wasted both the money and time in purchasing and reading this lousy book.
3,Malachy McCourt - waste of space?,"This book does not tell the story of a man's life as an adult, but merely documents the destruction of that life. His travels leave a trail of exploitation. I am only reading this story for traces of Frank McCourt. There are occasions where Malachy mentions his despair, but through the countless episodes in which he takes advantage of others, there is no witness, observation or analysis of the situations that he placed himself into. I was disappointed by the numerous mentions of encounters with the famous, unfortunately who have no impact on the story. I do not take pleasure in humour at the tragic expense of others."
1,Strange,"Frank McCourt wasn't really perfect. He drank quite a bit, left his wife and child. And yet, despite all of that and his affairs he is somewhat endearing. He also went on to become a teacher struggling to teach teenagers who had their minds on other things.But, his bother on the other hand. I just don't get him. The way he did foolish things wtihout much thought and was rude to his wife...Perhaps I am just judgemental, but I just don't like a Monk Swimming as much as Angela's Ashes. I know the books are entirely different, by different people, but still. Frank's story is the more interesting of the two."
1,Pure Junk with Letters Thrown In,"This book is junk. How dare Frank McCourt's brother sponge off Frank like this! I couldn't get past the first few pages, it was so bad. I wasn't expecting an Angela's Ashes; I would have settled for a little bit of honesty from the author! Is that too much to ask? I quickly got tired of the author telling of his exuberant, extraverted adventures as a boy, then having either the audacity or the blindness to claim a page later how he was just this ""shy"" little creature. Malachey couldn't be shy if his life depended on it! What a bunch of mularkey. This whole book was a scam. Don't waste your money. What little I read was terribly poor writing. This man had no business entering the field of writing, he is an actor and bartender who has obviously spent very little time honing any sort of craft, he is simply a remora fish eating the crumbs off the tailfin of his brother.And the countless, shameless name-dropping! Who cares! This was a fiasco."
1,Tired barstool tales retold to capitalize on Frank's success,"I agree that M. McCourt's book should not be compared with Angela's Ashes. One is a heartfelt and beautifully written childhood memoir; the other is a hodgepodge of apochryphal stories, much embellished over the years, put down on paper to make a fast buck. I am not surprised by M. McCourt's desire to do this. The praise lavished on the book's style and language by people who should know better is a surprise. I find the book thin,self involved and above all intensely repetitive. Change the names, change the location,add the usual diatribe about the Brits and you've completed another chapter. This was easy money for Malachy McCourt. Thank heaven mine was a borrowed copy. I own Angela's Ashes, book and unabridged on tape. But then as we have all agreed the two books should not be compared!"
2,A Loser's Lament,"As some recent reviews mention, I don't think McCourt is truly proud of his past. But he clearly is not too proud to immerse his readers in the graphic details of his drunken, selfish days. (Which the dust jacket assures us are over and that he is happily married.) Honest? About as honest as a typical guest on Jerry Springer and just as eager to shock. I detect more than a pinch of blarney (B.S.) in these twice told tales. Funny? I never even snickered at his tiresome exploits. Perhaps McCourt's is funnier in person. What's left is a long, boring litany of self-pity, selfishness and exaggeration. Happily married? Let's ask his second wife."
2,Can't believe they are brothers...,"I was so eager to read A MONK SWIMMING after finishing brother Frank's ANGELA'S ASHES...I wanted to know what happenned to the McCourt brothers after their arrival in N.Y. What a disappointment! While Frank becomes a teacher and a Purlitzer Price winner, brother Malachy becomes a self-destructing, womanizing drunk, worse than his father because he knew better! I read Malachy's book because of ""Angela's Ashes"", and it is hard not to compare them and be disappointed."
1,Don't waste your time reading this book.,It is apparant that Malachy McCourt scribbled this book in order to receive some benefits of his brother's fame.
1,I should have stopped with his brother's book!,"Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading ""Angela's Ashes"". Fifty pages into ""A Monk Swimming"", I realized I should not have bought it. After 100 pages, I stopped reading it. Malachy's story is a drunken braggard's tale of shameless debauchery. I found it had no literary value and I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,took after his pa quite a bit who he professes to hate a lot,"I listened to this as a book on tape.I felt that the author reading the account is the best way.I did not really like it all that well as it just seemed an account of how many drinks he could toss down and how many women he could bed and who was the latest celebrity he met.I kept thinking why soes he not put aside a little of the money and keep relying on chance and luck to get him out of trouble.Then when i think back on the book by Frank McCort i realize that that is how he was taught to survive and only by chance luck and the grace of God did he survive the years in Ireland to even get to America.I do prefer the actual life stories,but his life is part of all that."
1,Dont even try to compare this to his Big Brother Frank's Hit,"I was so dissapointed in this book. I had so looked forward to seeing Malachy's version of growing up in Ireland. I ended up reading about a drunken man who couldnt control his temper and bragged about bedding women. It gets even worse. He talks about how important he was, who he knew and how he knew them and we even got to hear about what a jerk Caroll O'Connor really is. Give it a rest Malachy. I wanted a story that wasnt about you bragging the whole story through. It made me wonder if this book shouldve been on the fiction shelf."
1,"A long winded story, but short on depth",I was impressed by Malachy's ignorance of the consequences of his own behavior. this was not a mea culpa even though it could have or should have been. I think this could have been written as a short story and of all the things he has experienced i wished this be could have been a less formulaic read.
5,Lively tales spun together by a first rate storyteller.,"Malachy McCourt picks up where his childhood left off in his brother Frank's memoir, ""Angela's Ashes"". McCourt is an excellent writer in his own right and tells the tales of his alcoholic young adulthood with humor, sadness, and a great love of the English language. An excellent read, much more than a lark."
1,A Book for Masochists,"Let's hope that a three hundred year heritage of great Irish literature hasn't fizzled down to the level of Malachy McCourt's memoirs. It is just barely possible that the autobiographical tales of a dissolute, profane, self-absorbed, drunken, under-employed name-dropper might turn out to be interesting. But not in this volume. While reading this book, the reader is likely to find himself or herself wishing that McCourt, like a few of his unfortunate siblings, had remained on Irish soil."
3,"good first half, dull second half","I loved the first half of this book, but the second half suceeds in telling us nothing more than MM was a drunk and liked to sleep around. I liked him at first, and then (unfortunatly) saw him as nothing more than an obnoxious bore."
3,"Lovely tone and musicality, but poor editions","I wish prominent recording artists and groups (particularly choral groups) of Renaissance music would use editions that were historically correct, for this recording contains numerous errors with regard to cadential formulae. Why not hire (or simply ask . . .) a scholar to review those scores or make an edition that is more accurate? I understand that this is 1993, but Apel's book was out for years at that point.I'm hoping that this changes more consistently in the professional music world."
5,Drop-dead funny,"I had the great privilege and honor of knowing the Love Goddess/Petite Princess when I lived in Chicago, and I've attended some of her accordeon-wielding performances in person. So it was a great treat to see her in performance at a university in Texas, complete with the cheesy prom dress, the accordeon and the lovingly abusive attitude toward her audience. Judy Tenuta does dead-to-rights imitations of everyone from Princess Diana (""She was kinda sassy, kinda brassy"") to Diana Ross. She channels Elvis Presley to say outlandishly rude things. And she sets up a tableau of slavery involving two audience members that had me down on the floor in hysterics. This is not for the weak-willed, and it is certainly not for anyone who picketed ""South Park"". But for anyone who wants to see over-the-top adult humor, it doesn't get any better than Judy Tenuta."
2,its ok,It makes a freaking mess so have your swivel sweeper or what it may be on standby!!! Other than that they have fun digging the bones out & in some cases it's worth it!
4,Haunting and Strong,"These original tunes feel like Hawaii to me. Charged with energy and tradition, these songs will transport you not to a fake Tiki-filled hotel lounge, but to the mist-kissed mountains, and the rainy warmth of Hilo. I have listened to this CD many times in Hawaii, and am buying another to take me there on cold winter nights. Some of the songs combine Hawaiian and English, which I found a bit jarring. The words, thank goodness, are written in the CD liner in Hawaiian with the English translation, unlike most other Hawaiian CD's. This goes a long way to educating us haoles, and greatly enhanced my enjoyment."
3,Could use a re-design,"After the first week or so using this product, I noticed the ventilation to the back portion of the cushion dwindled & only the seat portion pushed air. I suspect that the manufacturer's materials are not robust enough to hold up to the weight of an average person (although I would expect the seat to fail first). The concept is good, the execution does not live up to the potential."
4,Review of Self-cooling Car Seat Cusion,"This is a very good product. I have a skin condition that itches when I get hot and this car seat provides cooling to allow me to drive in reasonable comfort.If I had a recommendation it would be to design it such that over time a 225 pound person would not crush it, thereby reducing the air flow to the back area."
3,Not quite as advertised,"It is a great idea, but the functionality is very lacking. One other reviewer stated his weight may have hindered the seats air flow. I weigh barely more than half his weight and there was still very litle air flow. I bought the product when my car's a/c went out, and hoped my back would stay dry on the way to work. No such luck. Not worth the price until improved."
4,Cool and quick,"It's not as cooling as cars that have the cooled seats built it, but it does help in 90+ heat in NYC. Quick shipping and good customer service. Thank you!"
1,If you like sitting on bricks buy this item,"The concept is great, the design is good and YES it will cool your body in summer days especially when the inside of your car is cool. The problem I have with it is that it is too stiff. It does feel like you are sitting on concrete, it is very hard, the material used in building this product is very hard and it does not have to be.We had to lower the seat to the lowest level possible due to the position this product makes you sit in the car.It cools your body by using the inside air of the car, so if the inside air is hot you will get hot air but if the inside is cool then you get cool air. The question you need to ask yourself, if the air inside the car is cool do I really need this?In all fairness and honesty, it does work and lowers your body temperature. It is just uncomfortable."
1,Went bad right at 3 months!,I bought this form my husband and it went bad right at the end of the 3 month warranty period. I was very disappointed. I have now had to purchase a second seat cooler from Comfort Wheels and hopefully that will last longer.
5,A mysterious man who solved a mysterious puzzle,"Linear B was a script of unknown language that appeared in bits and pieces in archaelogical digs in an around Greece. Nobody could decipher it; in fact, they couldn't even agree on what language the script represented. Andrew Robinson tells the fascinating story of Michael Ventris, the architect/amateur linguist who 'cracked' the code of Linear B and proved to the world that it contained an ancient form of Greek.The story unfolds with the same drama as a murder mystery or detective story. Robinson makes what could have been a complicated story eloquent and clear.Although I recommend this book highly, at the end of it I still felt in the dark about Ventris himself. He seems to have been a great eccentric and very private individual. His sudden death at the age of 34 seems to have occurred under a cloud of deep depression that Robinson does not really explain. Linear B may be deciphered, but Ventris is still a mystery."
3,The Best Case for Conquering Death Till Now,A very inspiring read. Alan Harrington mustered the best case for conquering Old Age and Death in 1969. But he was a bit too much ahead of the science. Did not have stem-cell research and the coming-of-age of biotech and genetic engineering and cloning. So in the end he was a bit tentative. You should buy book anyway. It is an Immortalist standard.
5,A very thought-provoking book,"""The time has come to kill Death.""This book reviews the possibility of making people immortal and examines the philosophical and other consequences of doing so. It is a wonderful concept, and turns the book into a model giant essay, providing an excuse for examining the key role that death plays in human civilization. They don't write 'em like this any more.Someone should start writing The New Immortalist. It's about time."
3,interesting,"This is a good product to really practice and perfect speaking the correct way. I found it really interesting. It comes with a headset for listening and speaking into. However, I had to take the program off my computer because it slowed everything down. I will reinstall it at a later time when I have time to use it. But to have it sitting on my computer for me to use it a few minutes a day isn't worth the headache of it slowing everything down."
5,looks great,They were nice and heavy look great on the wall. Would recommend them to any one. Great size majority of them were pretty big.
4,Good Sexy Sci-Fi Movie,"Well I must give this movie a 4 star rating. The main characters aren't all that great but the characters that they encounter back in time are hot. Especially King Louis wife, who stands around naked for about half the movie and doesn't throw on any clothes what so ever. There is also some lesbian action, and close-ups of the females genitels, which lead the movie more X-rated than R-rated."
3,Connects OK; but typing is difficult,"This Keyboard and its individual keys is/are too narrow to typeefficiently.This results in your making many typing errors to go back over ( such as 'tanks' for 'thanks',etc.On the other hand; it does connect to the receivor pretty good as long as you have an unobstructed view and they are on the same level.The Keyboard needs to be revised badly before it can rate 5 or more stars!"
2,Price could not be beat but...,A few of the keys stuck but It was better than the one I had to replace.
2,"There's ""Sister Cecil,"" ""Sunny Day"" and then...","there's everything else. Sister is a great tale of family and of ... boldness versus introversion. It's delivered with flair, love, and passion, and every note rings true. Sunny Day kicks off the CD with a joyous ode to new beginnings. The quality drop after those two songs is dramatic, unfortunately. To this listener, the rest of the CD is overwritten, overproduced, and at times borders on the histrionic. I guess a Yale education may not be the best available passport to some professions. There's plenty of promise, but here it is unfulfilled. I'd like to see another CD from her where she eases up a bit -- she needs to write about what she knows rather than trying to be ""artist,"" and to learn that there are more than two speeds -- power ballad and power power -- to performing. You don't have to turn the amps and the voice up to 11 all the time!"
3,"Less Texas,more Jersey and Britrock. Still good.","When Mary and her Telecaster, w/ ""Yale"" written on the headstock, came down to Texas, all her club gigs were more countryfied. Then she did a spell playing guitar for Jimmie Dale Gilmore. I think most of us were surprised by her CD...pleasantly surprised.A more rockin' sound. She has the goods- she can write,play,and perform. She derserves to be heard.Get this CD."
5,Definitely a page-turner,"Denise Tyrrell has created what must surely be an insider's view of Hollywood, with a cast of fascinating characters. From her spunky protagonist Izzy to the creepy game show producer Arthur Franco, they are interesting, original people. You may have suspected that show business was like this, and now you'll believe it. Vivid settings, gripping plot, some laugh-out-loud moments, and a satisfying ending. This book kept me turning pages to find out ""what happens next""."
4,It's Special...,"When I first bought this album, a long time ago, I didn't listen to it much. In fact, I didn't listen to the whole thing until recently. I purchased it at the same time as a bunch of other albums, and it just sort of sank to the bottom. However, I recently got a random urge to listen to it, and it's really grown on me. I've been listening to it for several days now... I'll listen to this when I'm on my computer, and then Catch 22's Keasbey Nights when I'm elsewhere... I spend most of my time on the computer... The Specials and Catch 22 are really not similar in any way, I just happen to be listening to the two of them a lot."
2,reggae and other jamacan rooted songs-all covers,"i'm not a huge fan of reggae, mostly Ska and Two tone, but since this was a cover album...I'm giving it a kinda low score. i think if this had some of their stuff, I'd like it more. still, its The Specials, and it does complete your specials collection"
5,Can't Get Enough of This One,I keep this one in my car stereo. This is my highway-daily ride to work music. I love his voice and the lyrics to every song.
2,Not what I expected,"I am a huge Willie Hutch fan. I would not recommend this disk though. It seems to be mostly his later music and not the early classics from the films ""The Mack"" and ""Foxy Brown"". I would definitely recommend picking up both of those soundtracks instead of this compilation. This disk does include a few tracks from The Mack soundtrack and the theme song from Foxy Brown. However, there is too much filler. Not the real soulful songs you would expect from Willie Hutch. Very disappointed."
5,New Author Hits a Homer,"Lizzy Morrow's no-holds-barred look at the day-to-day struggles of a thirty-something single woman trying to create sense and security for herself is a masterful stroke for a first-time author. Rarely does a book make me laugh, cry, cringe and clap; this book did all that and kept me turning the pages late into the night. As a former writing teacher, I also found this to be a solidly crafted document with occasional flashes of writing brilliance. If this is Ms. Morrow's number one, I can't wait for number two!"
4,"Dated, but a worthwhile perspective","Published in 1976, this is hopelessly outdated in terms of interpreting many of the laws of the game, particularly laws 11 (offside) and 12 (fouls). However, as a monograph on the philosophy of refereeing, or how to think about the game as a referee, it is very good. As a new youth referee, I have found a small number of books on this subject so far, and this is definitely worth reading, so long as the caveats on laws changed since 1976 are observed.Note: one might think that author Eric Sellin was inspired by the excellent 2001 book - For the Good of the Game, by Robt. Evans and Ed Bellion. In fact, it seems he excerpted small pieces from the 25-year later work verbatim. The explanation is found in the footnotes, which give credit to magazine articles and pamphlets written by Robt. Evans early in his referee career."
4,Metal awakening in Italy,"While most of the bands that you could fit into this sort of metal have one guitarist and one keyboardist, Labyrinth has two guitarists and a keyboardist. This benefits hugely ""Return to Heaven Denied"". Amazing instrumental interludes featuring power guitar riffing, keyboard background and guitar solos at the same time, make of this a great album.Rob Tyrant, the new vocalist of the band, is nowhere near it's predecesor, Fabio Lione (now in Rhapsody) but gets the job done. Though the band is not technically bright, I enjoyed very much Mat Stanciou's druming."
3,Good album....,"A good album this is.But just that.In my opinnion,a little overrated.Of course,it's an exquisitelly worked album,musically speaking.The only thing that I find a little incoherent,is the lyrics.Why?Well,I shouldn't call my first major release ""Return to heaven denied"".Why?Because it makes me think that we are missing something that happened Before.The lyrics need some kinda explanation that you cannot find within the whole album.Anyway,it's a good album,for progressive metal fans,and for power metal fans.Enjoy it!"
5,Excelent Glory Metal piece,"From their first 2 CDs not so admirable... This Album seems to be an interesting disc..this band from Italy Have done an excelent work and unique style (I think), Their new singer show as an incredible vocalist despite their previous singer who was excelent too; now he is in an Amazing band called Rhapsody!. I recommend this CD ""Return to Heaven Denied"" for anyone who like the true metal music."
5,The best into to modern logic there is.,"Hodges, please get a second edition of this wonderful book back into print!!This is probably the best intro there is to modern logic for people without prior training in science and math. The examples are all taken form linguistics and philosophy. Ironically, the author is also a high power mathematician, but he does not let that show. This is the book Quine should have written instead of his Elementary Logic. Also clearer and less threatening to sanity than Spencer Brown's Laws of Form."
5,60's Era Surfers!,"What can I say?What 1960's era surfer DIDN'T rock to Surfer Joe? LOL!This a fun blast from the past.For me, Surfer Joe was the reason to pick it up but I'm a Hog for You is also a kick in the pants.Lots of tunes you may remember listening to on the way to and from the beach.Wipe Out isn't quite the Venture's version(no maniacal intro! I miss that... :) but is still fun.Recommended to help recapture those aging memories of fun and care free times. :)Stay k00l Gremmies and Hodads! LOL!"
5,Delightful,This is one of my favorite Elizabeth Peters books. I love all the Vicky Bliss books. I just wish Ms. Peters would write more of them. I enjoy all her books but this one is by far the best.
5,A Must Read!,"This book is one of the best written mysteries I have ever read. The main character Vicky Bliss is surrounded by some of the most entertaining secondary characters ever put into a novel. Her lovable boss Schmidt and deceptive love intrest John will you keep you reading Elizabeth Peters books untill all hours of the night. This is a fast paced adventure that will take you to Egypt and back, it is impossible to walk away from!"
3,Exceptional writing - good if you like comfy mystery,"Well I wanted to read EP's book as I heard her interviewed a few years back and have read her romances. She's an excellent writer and seems like she would be very comforting for cozy readers. While I liked her writing, the story was too slow for me to finish. But alas I am not a mystery reader (except DL Sayers and AG). Would recommend for those who love the nice slow paced mystery."
5,"Vicky takes a cruise and discovers murder,love,and anger.","Vicky Bliss takes a nile cruise and runs into her lost love, John,and he's married!She's too busy to deal with it because Dr.Max is back and a new scandel is aloof. Will all end well?Does John still love Vicky.Is the marriage for real,and will Dr. Bliss escape the hands of evil? Find out for yourself!The only disapointment is the book has to end"
2,Not too exited about it,"I have no idea where do those 5 stars from the numerous reviews come from. This book is closer to a soap opera then to a serious mystery novel. It reminds me little of M.C. Beaton novels, only that in my opinion those are significantly more enjoyable to read. Perhaps it has been a mistake to start with a 5th book in the series, if the 1st book in the series comes my way I will give it a try, if only to verify that the rest is not much better then the 5th. I guess these books are targeted towards female audience.On the other thought, I might give this author miss in a future it took a considerable effort to get to the end of this book. Not my cup of tea."
2,Hard to believe,"Sorry guys, but I have been using the demo and it is hard to believe most of the reviews I am reading here. Clearly, they were not written by ESL students and they seem very professional and with a lot of info about the software (looks like written by the developers). I find the inter phase to be crowded and difficult to follow. This software is not intuitive at all and it is hard to follow any logical sequence of learning. Anyway, download the demo and try for yourself."
4,Good product,"I'm Vietnamese student. Pronunciation Patterns is very good one as follows:1/ Clearly sound and easy to repeat.2/ There are thousands of new words to learn.3/ program is very good at automaticly repeating, recording and replaying4/ Customer service is very kindness and willingness.Excellent!Some points that the author needs to improve:1/ Some words do not match with the sounds2/ Lack of some dipthong souds3/ Diagram is not very perfect. It means that it's very difficult to realize what s student need to improve after recording his or her voice.4/ In CD, the authour should only use the words that you already set up in your program. I saw some words in the screen, but in fact they are not in the program so it makes customer unsatisfied.5/ I do not like to use CD to much, because it may harm CD driver; Why don't you think about the way to copy it into only one computer and open it without CD?6/The price is too high for a student.Anyway, it is 4/5Hope you enjoy it."
4,Pronunciation Patterns is a great spoken english self-taught material.,"I got the PP weeks ago and have been using it since then. I just love it because of a lot of reasons:1. Systemmatically teach me the American Phonetic Alphabet that I missed when I started to study English. It helps me correct many pronunciation errors;2. The more practice by following the sound of each word, the more confident and comfortable to communicate with people in English;3. It is a effective and convenient approach to study, especially I have to work in the day time;4. It is not boring at all, actually it is fun;5. Quick and satisfactory supports from the company;6. I wish I could find the material years ago;I think the only drawback is that I have to insert the CD to play even if I install it to my computer."
2,"Awkward to play, had to return it","Guitar looked great, sounded great, but was extremely awkward to play. Since thereare no cutaways on this guitar I felt it was hard to maneuver around the frets. I'm 5'9"" and I felt dwarfed by the size of this bad boy. I think if you're 6'7"" this might be the guitar for you."
5,Spectacular Instrument,"This guitar is among many of which I have owned. I'm a seasoned bass player so I look for quality in my instruments. This guitar meets and exceeds the expectations I had for it, given the price posted. Although it doesn't have a top notch on it for a guitar strap that really means nothing to someone who wants a really nice guitar for a value price. The guitar plays well and sounds great, The electronic pickup on it is touchy but, who's to argue for the price. I've read many good things about Dean brand guitars, and I must say that so far all that I have read has been true. To a beginning bass player looking for a good bass I say this is a great buy for the price. To a seasoned bass player I say play this guitar and see if you can put it down.. So far I have had more fun with this guitar than any other that I have owned."
3,I felt that this story was VERY slow...,"I didn't care for this book very much. Olivia Byrde is a level minded young woman who has a knack for making brillant matches between eligible young men and suitable young ladies and from the title you would think that Olivia's matchmaking talents would shine throughout the book, but she's away from London most of the time, therefore little matchmaking is done. Although the hero, Neville Hawke, is a drunk, he is very likeable. He is haunted by his terrifying memeories of the war and he drinks to get away from the pain. And while I liked the attraction between Neville and Olivia, there are too many false starts and the romance doesn't get going until the end and then it's wrapped up too quickly.I wouldn't spend the money. Borrow or buy a second hand copy."
1,Simply Awful,"Our hero (and I use the term loosely) is one of the most irritating men I have ever read about in a romance novel. Not only is he constantly insulting Olivia, but he actually sneaks into her room, rifles through her belongings and reads her journal. INEXCUSABLE. And Olivia actually refers to him as ""charming"". If someone had so little respect for me that they would invade my privacy in such a manner, I would be hard pressed not to assault them physically. Anyone who finds Neville ""adorable"" has a screw loose. He doesn't strike me as particularly vulnerable, he comes across as insufferably cocky. If I was Olivia, I would sell my childhood home and move as far away from him as I could get. What a jerk. His wartime experiences (which we learn about on the LAST PAGE of the book) do not excuse his annoying, insulting, disrespectful and UNheroic behavior. This book can be summed up in a four letter work: YUCK"
1,Annoying,"Olivia is attracted to Neville Hawke, but fights her feeling for most of the book. The story drags. Am I the only one who found her mother obnoxious? Her sister Sarah was annoying as well. I will not pick up a book from this author again."
2,"Boring, boring, boring ( snore )",I truly love Rexanne Becnel's books. All but this one. The hero was a big alcoholic loser and the heroine was an annoying prude. I hope Ms. Becnel's future books show the same spirit as in her previous ones.
1,Bewildered,"I had read ""The Troublemaker"" first. It was a good book and I am glad I read it first or I never would have enjoyed it. The Troublemaker made Olivia seem like the sweetest of women but in he Matchmaker which is Olivias story all she does is cry. I was hoping by the end that she would just kill herself. I had to put the book down so many times because the cry baby in Olivia was quite trying. The hero seemed like such a nice guy. What he saw in her is beyond me."
4,"good, but where's Merideth ?","Glad to see a decent,respectable collection for the show. I really prefer the later years with Merideth MacRae and Mike Minor. I hope more will come, I love when Betty Jo and Steve get married, have a baby, etc."
3,Where is season 3?,Bring season 3 out and 4 and so on! No reason to have all the sister shows out on DVD and not all of Petticoat Junction!
4,Petticoat Junction- Ultimate Collection,This was a fun video. We especially enjoyed the introductions. The video quality was top-notch. We hope there will there be similar packages for later seasons!
2,Preposterous,"You have only to look at any portrait of Edward, Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria, to see that he was her natural father. The physiognomy - everything is identical - something that Queen Victoria herself did not always appreciate. Melbourne described her as ""...le Roi Georges en petticoats..."" (so forcibly did she resemble George III, her paternal grandfather) and whenever people commented on her strong likeness to her father, she would reply rather hopefully, ""We think we have more from our mother"" - Victoire, Duchess of Kent, had been a very pretty woman in her youth. The supposition - unsubstantiated - that Victoria may have had an unknown father - i.e. that the Duchess of Kent had taken a lover - is preposterous. The book is neither satisfying nor well written. I give it two stars from charity rather than from conviction."
3,grandmother of europe,queen victoria was the grandmother of europe who brought hemophilla to many european royal houses that ended in great tragic.
4,Good movie -but,"While I did not read all reviews those that I did read I mostly agree with.I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was longer than it had to be to tell the story.I noticed one glaring error (but did not let it affect my rating) and that wasthe scene in which the airfield operator was repairing a piece of electronic equipment.The board that he was working on showed a series of power transistors but the mostrudimentary transistor was not invented until after the war in 1947.This movie did make me wish that some Hollywood producer would have the foresightto make a Doc-u Drama on the Woman's Air Service Pilots (WASP). There is a story thatis dieing to be told in a movie format. I only wish that I had the money to do it. :-)I think the directer of ""A League of There Own"" could do a good job of it.As I'm a war movie buff this DVD will go in my library but a lot of time will go by before watching it again."
1,Should have been a great story,"As a World War II Commemorative Tour Director for the past 28 years, I anticipated that this movie would reveal the little-known history of aircraft were flown across the Atlantic. However this movie is a farce. The history is there, but the acting is amateur and the story line is ridiculous."
1,everything great except for one thing,Wonderful movie except for the un-called for illicit intimacy displayed on the screen where young people will probably be watching. It added nothing whatsoever to what otherwise could have been a great story.
4,An entertaining story based on real events 1,"I enjoyed this series and especially appreciated the story since it was based on actual events that occurred. It was a little melodramatic at times and sluggish, but definitely held my interest from beginning to end. The cinematic scenes were spectacular and well done. I would definitely recommend the film. Great acting, a good story, and all the special camera affects to make it a stunningly brilliant film."
4,Great history,"I enjoyed this movie. I was not aware of thispart of the history of World War II. These werebrave men who did get ""the shaft"" by the RoyalBritish Military. They were the ground breakers.Hooray for them!!"
3,others,Have seen others on the subject that were more interesting. . but it is ok for a rainy afternoon . .
4,Interesting Historically,"This video is well done as a historical mini-series. It is not so well acted and produced that it is something to watch over-and-over, but the little-known history behind this video is worth learning and those who actually flew those missions are worthy of our respect and thanks."
1,"Sorry, but it's just ...","This reads like poorly researched graduate-school blathering (which I expect it is).Mr Lock appears to have approached his sources with his thesis already formed and to have avoided all contact with anything that might force him to reconsider. Check out his footnote admitting that his use of Ellington's song title is totally inappropriate to what he's trying to make it mean, yet he decided to use it anyway!His comparison of Sun Ra's mythological musings and autobiographical confessions with slave narratives is ridiculous in that it reveals a thorough lack of knowledge of comparative religion. The author acts as though the experience of death and rebirth or of choosing a new name to reflect a new station in life were phenomena unique to (and invented by) African-Americans. He clearly didn't research this topic thoroughly.This is a really shoddy work and not worth your time, much less your money."
5,Soft and smooth,"I love everything Pure Fiji makes and this soap is no exception. While it melts fairly quickly in my bath water, it smooths and softens very noticably. It has a very faint coconut scent. I was extremely impressed the first time I used it with how much it softened my skin and silkened it on contact. When this soap is wet it feels soft on the surface. I am willing to pay a premium to use this exquisite soap from Fiji. The nut oils from the south Pacific are the best thing I've ever used on my skin. This is the only soap I want to use. I think it replenishes the essential fatty acids of the skin with it's nut oils and coconut oil. Simply the best there is, and I am a fancy soap fanatic."
1,Is less quality best?,"Bought the lamp for a second time because I love the design, but was ""surprised"" to find that the Chinese manufacturers have once again managed to decrease the quality of the product. Dimensions were imprecise so on bending the parts the metal grinds in unexpected area; my lamp's metal arm came already bent (though beautifully packaged) and I had to figure out what was happening. And, it is about an inch shorter than the previous model. Big disappointment, perhaps a better deal to buy the expensive version from the beginning. Also, the coils rusted very quickly."
3,Not built as well as I had hoped,"Upon receiving the lamp, I was impressed with the box weight. It felt like something substantial was inside. I got it all put together, and that feeling slowly diminished. The 'handle' that goes into the top of the lamp (used for moving it for adjustment) could not be tightened enough to not wiggle. I figured I would just deal with this. I then went to tighten the knob on the base and the knob twisted right off. This was with my hand, and not because of excessive force.I guess I needed to spend more, but at this price I thought I would get a better made lamp of a better grade steel. Maybe I just got a bad unit, but I'm returning and not replacing with the same lamp.I'm giving it 3 stars because the amazon return process was so easy and pain free."
1,"Absolute Second Rate Junk sold as ""Premium"" quality","The base screw of this lamp broke less than 2 months after receiving it. I have probably adjusted it 4-5 times in that interval. Poor quality parts likely from dubious sources. Stay away from this product. Otherwise, all I can say it looks very nice, while it stands."
3,"good........well so,so","It is nice because it is high frequency, which follows to a clear image. It is goo for it's price."
2,What a Disappointment !,"I LOVE this movie,but this DVD version leaves a lot to be desired.It's 2 stars for technical quality only.Otherwise it's a VERY enjoyable film.Be warned-this is not a Region one version of the Australian DVD of Starstruck that came out last year.In this version the colors are faded and muddy. The picture definition is poor.There are no additional features to speak of.It is full screen with no other options.It looks like someone did a video to DVD transfer on some very low budget equipment.What a disappointment ! I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for years.Stick with the VHS version of Starstruck until a better DVD version comes out !"
1,Big disappointment,"I'll have to agree with everyone on this title. I remember seeing this in the theater, then finally purchasing the laser disc when it was released. This has to be one of my favorite Aussie flicks, but this version is not worth the money even if they charged a dollar. The color is muted, the sound was poor even though the box claims ""enhanced"" and nowhere does it state on the box or on any purchase sites that it is fullscreen, so you're left with the feeling of being taken once it arrives. WHO transfers a film musical to full screen these days? The US version is a rip off. Wait until someone in Australia takes pity on us here in the US and releases a widescreen enhanced version. I purchased mine from Barnes and Noble and immediately sent it back."
4,Return to Deadtown,"Heavily influenced by ""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts"" by Brian Eno & David Byrne, Leimer's 1982 ""Land of Look Behind"" drew on similar rock rhythm beds, overlaid with droney synthesizers and the occasional found vocal. Although composed for a film about Bob Marley's funeral in Jamaica, the beats are all 4/4 American as opposed to the loping 1/5 beats of reggae.In fact, one of the things that made MLITBOG so kaleidoscopically mind-bending was the rampant cultural appropriation. By comparison, LOLB uses traces of rhythms and snippets of voices taken from the movie as mere ingredients in Leimer's introspective style, stripping them of context and meaning. Although this album is alone in Leimer's catalog as containing rock rhythms, it is at heart not so different from his usual rarified ambient music."
5,One great story,"The main character has little feeling and reading about how she came to be that way was great. The entire plot was wonderful, cleanly written with nothing left hanging and Cleo was endearing but maddening. The author's description of the era and township was flattering and understandable. You will never forget Cleo."
4,Good collection of basic information,"This handbook, writen by several authors, is a solid collection of some basic administrative information. Although several chapters are not as well developed as they could be, there is enough here to get you started. To balance this shortcoming, there are extensive lists of additional readings that can provide more detail. There are chapters on finances, special events, staff, leadership, organization, and more."
5,A wonderful handbook for Church Administration.,"This book was wonderfully constructed. It is a must have for all pastors, chairmen of deacons, trustees and administrative assistants. If you have a question about how a proceedure should be done, more than likey this book has covered it. It will certainly be a compliment to your personal library.Bless Your SpiritRev. Matt Yarbrough, Jr."
3,Could be helpful,"This book provides a lot of information regarding the operation of a church. There are a number of helpful examples of things such as finacial forms, meeting itineraries, and other items. This book is somwhat dated in the area of technology, but otherwise is fairly good. This book covers the most minute details of the church administration. I had this as an assigned text for a class, and my classmates generally reffered to the book as the Church Micromanagment Handbook, which should give you a feel for what I disliked about this book."
2,Poor Page Binding,"The informational contents of the book itself is good reading, very informative. The problem I encountered with the book is in the difficulty which has now presented itself in reading it. After only a few days, the pages began to come loose from the binding and are now falling out. I have never had this happen on any other hardbound book I have ordered from Amazon. I would have returned the book but by the time this issue surfaced, I had already put my name in the book and done extensive highlighting of the text during my study time in preparation for class discussions of assigned reading. Very disappointing.Thank you for the opportunity to provide my feedback."
3,ME FE/EIT,"This textbook serves as a review only, for it lacks the content required to solve the problems. As a study guide does a good job, but requires more clarity when presenting the content. There is also several mistakes associated with numbers only."
2,Just a bunch of problems,"Not very thorough in explanatory the concept behind the problems. It seems like a collection or problems with their solution , which is not very self explanatory. It did not help me in preparing for the FE exam."
3,"Excellent in Part, But Becoming Outdated","Published in 2000, this is an excellent book for one to begin to get information on bladder cancer. However, we find it is becoming quite outdated. For example, chemotherapy drugs have progressed beyond those referenced in the text and CT equipment is now newer than that which appears to have been standard when the book was written. The authors could do a tremendous service by updating this book, and in so doing, provide a great service to many people with this disease."
4,PLACING A DIFFICULT TOPIC INTO PERSPECTIVE,"Dr. Schoenberg writes not only to the patient but to the caregiver(s). His optimistic and reassuring approach is straight forward, no beating around the bush. The reader obtains a thoroughly well rounded education through Dr.Schoenbergs' discussion of anatomy, analogies, drawings, treatments, and outcomes.Great reference book should be in everyones library. My suggestion for the book would have been to list the major Bladder Cancer Centers in the United States. Enabling an individual to seek assistance in their own state other than Johns Hopkins, which is a fine Hospital.I agree with previous reader websites would have been helpful.Reading this book prior to visting your physician is strongly reccommended."
5,A Must Read for Anyone Diagnosed with Bladder Cancer,This book was recommended to me shortly after my husband was diagnosed with bladder cancer. It's outstanding and should be the first read upon learning of this diagnosis. It covers everything that a patient (and loved ones) should know.
1,Worthless,"Worthless propaganda... not worth reading. If you want to get a well-rounded education on abortion, run far away from this book."
5,magnificent,Matthew Good's lyrics are so intoxicating this is one of the best bands of the 90's no doubt. The melodies are haunting and quite different from the rest of the rock groups that have surfaced this decade.
5,I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.,Canada's best kept secret. This CD is the best I've heard in ages. I hate to see this music fade into obscurity because the record company isn't doing their job.
5,amazing,"This cd is the 2nd best cd i've ever listened to, it's hard to beat clumsy by our lady peace. but this has my favourite song of all time, apparitions. great song. rico is the 2nd best song on the cd, everything is automatic, deep six, indestructible, prime time deliverance, and so many more....... go out and buy this right now, don't even wait"
4,"Good dimmer, easy to install, does its job.... picture a little deceiving","This is a good dimmer switch: easy to install, works well, and durable. It does its job. And it come screw on wire connectors which is a plus. But I had to give it 4 stars because unlike the picture, this unit does not come with a wall plate. Other than that, its a fine dimmer switch."
4,Works as designed,"I bought this to replace a Lutron dimmer that is similar, except that it has an on/off switch under the dimmer slider. However, after having three of them die on me, I have decided to just switch to simpler slider model. This switch works as intended and was easy to install."
4,Good basic light dimmer,"Have this set to my smaller ceiling fan, worth putting it in and installing it, and most importantly it works well. One thing is that if you don't have any previous experience, installing this will be a hassle for you. Just be forewarned."
5,Quiet dimmer,"Lutron is the only brand of dimmer I have tried that does cause electrical interference. I had a Lutron dimmer fail after thirty years, so I replaced it with this. Other than being made in China, the new one seems about the same. I have since bought two more Lutron dimmers."
4,The dark side of the moon,"I must say that this is a collection of some excellent stories, may of which are either somewhat dark, or have unhappy endings. But these are the type that scare us somewhat, because we look into our soul and examine ourselves in a new light.A good read for any time of the day, Harry Harrison's ""Galactic Dreams"" is a well done collection of short stories, whose plots range from funny familiars, to hauntingly frightening newbies."
4,Decent Value,"I have read a few of the reviews, and feel they are pretty accurate. I don't yet have any issues with the screen, inputs, or outputs. It seems to be a pretty good value for the $699.00 I paid, but much over that, look for a good deal on a 1080p. Best Buy was charging 899.00 for this unit, but that is to much money for this particular set. I made them do a price match, and left the store with it. Look at your budget and what you are going to use it for, if you can spare the few hundred extra, go with the 1080p. If 699.00 or less is your max, this set can compete with anything in it's price range. I bought it as a replacement for my livingroom CRT set(also a Sharp). Quite a dramatic improvement."
4,Great Picture - Slow tuner,The picture is great and we have been very happy with the product.Only on small complaint - while channel surfing it takes some time between stations. Since this is our first hi def digital TV I am not sure if this is the norm for all of these types of TV's or if it is unique to this product.
4,Great LCD for the money,"For the money this is a really good LCD. The picture quality is fantastic, but I have to agree with several other reviewers who noted the sound quality of the speakers is pretty disappointing. I had to hookup a pair of external speakers the same afternoon I bought the television. Even with the volume turned up high these speakers just don't deliver much sound. The other thing worth mentioning is that the base of the set doesn't swivel, so if you were hoping to rotate the screen forget it. Setup was easy, and the television weighs next to nothing (I'm guessing 25 lbs or so) compared to our old 27"" CRT!"
3,Dead Pixel already,"Just purchased this unit and have a blown pixel. I don't know if it came out of the box this way or if it just occured after 3 weeks of usage. In anycase, I looked this up on google and it seems to be a not so uncommon problem with some SHARP LCD's. I am a bit frustrated, but atleast the blown pixel is on the bottom right portion of the screen and not dead smack in the middle. I called SHARP customer service and was on hold for about ten minutes. The service rep was pleasant and responsive. She offered me a few options to fix my problem. We documented this problem and will request service if I see more dead pixels appear in the future.All in all, this television is good. Blow pixel seems to be the luck of the draw with LCDs. I also own a SAMSUNG 42inch plasma which I think is excellent."
3,Didn't say Easy Piano...,"I ordered this book off of amazon since I've been wanting it for awhile and it was a lot cheaper than it is other places. I was very excited when it arrived only to be disappointed that it was the easy piano version. I skimmed over the pages and noticed that all the songs (from what I saw) were in the key of C major. While this is a very good book for beginners, I wanted the more advanced book. I may have missed it, but I usually check each item on the site very carefully before ordering, so I'm not sure how this happened. Just a warning for anyone who is not aware of this."
4,This is a very good book,"They selected the best songs and I'm very glad to have a copy. It's a bit difficult to play these numbers on a harp (I have no piano)... but I like having it anyway, being a Phantom nut as I am. There's not much I can say about sheet music but I recommend this."
3,Music book Review,Not what I was going for. Had some of the sogns I needed but I was looking for the entire selection of songs not just the most famous ones.
5,Phantom of thr Opera (Easy Piano),"This book has surpassed my expectations. The music is simple enough that I can play it with very little difficulty and can add my own improvisations. I am very pleased with its simplicity. Some of the lyrics are slightly different than the movie lyrics, but the change is very insignificant.I would definitely recommend this piano book to anyone who enjoys playing the songs from this musical."
5,Phantom of the Opera is great !,This music is definitely for piano players who like easier arrangements. The songs can be played easily and include all the most popular songs in the musical. I really love mine.
5,Good for intermediate pianists,"I made my mother buy me this book. I read the novel, bought the CD, and now have the piano music. It's wonderfully written and very true to the original. The songs are not hard, but some of the keys are. You get used to it."
3,ONLY FOR BEGINNERS!!!!!!,Please read the notation before buying this. I did not and I learned a lesson. This is for beginners!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,This is so cool!,"I love this play, book, and movie! The music is really fun to play, but watch out for the chords! ""The Point of No Return"" calls for all 5 fingers spread across more than one octave, ouch! The chords in TPONR and the theme song were the hardest for me, but the rest is easy and fun! Buy this!!"
5,Wow!,"This music is so fun to play! Every time I sit at the piano I feel that I can't leave it without playing through the Phantom of the Opera. The music isn't really all that complicated and the songs are rich and full like the ones on the C.D. I only wish I had an organ to play the Phantom's theme on. Very cool. I imagine my family is extremely sick of hearing me play this music everyday, but I can't help it. : ) All I can say is if you love the music and can play piano... buy it!"
5,Dirked,"The item was shipped to me quickly, and matched exactly to the description. I was very pleased with the knife."
1,Absolute CRAP!,I'd rate this product ZERO STARS if Amazon would let me. This toner cartridge made awful noises right out of the box & failed within a week and that wasn't even under extreme printing conditions. Avoid buying this product at all cost; it's not worth it! Spend the few extra bucks & buy the real thing & you won't have any problems or regrets.
2,Looks Good But Disappoints,"We chose this microscope based on the safety features and the fact that it has two different lights and some acessories. We figured our 9 year old daughter would spend hours using it.Out of the box, it looked really impressive but the lights are poor at best, the slides hard to position and it is impossible to place a hair for example beteen two slides to examine it. Images are less than acceptable to say the least.I don't care if it is all plastic, but it at least should do what a microscope should do!Now less than a month after the purchase, one of the bulbs have blown and my daughter is asking me to buy her a microscope that ""works""I should have sent it back, and now regret it. I do not recommend this to anyone! Too bad, because it really is an interesting and stylish design!"
4,Great gift,"I bought this Giant Microbe for my little brother, who had giardia during this last summer.He loved it, and it proved to be a great gift.I imagined it a little larger, though..."
1,What????,"I recently purchased this cd based on a review I read in a music magazine. They gave it the ""thumbs up"". I anticipated some great music in the vein of Angie Stone, Pru Renfro, Joe, et al. I can't for the life of me figure out what they were listening to! This cd offers nothing to promote it other than the fact Mr. Simmonds wrote or co-wrote every song on the cd. His voice here is not remarkable in any setting he presents, the songs are dull, the playing is uninspired. In addition to the aforementioned shortcomings, there is a sameness to every song on this disk. Not just because the same person wrote each song, but more so because Mr. Simmonds lacks objectivity in his work and he either did not seek outside input or ignored the input given. Skip this cd; maybe next time or check him out in another setting doing someone else's music. He could be a great R&B singer."
5,THE SONG ALONE BROKE MY HEART,his song ALONE MADE ME CRY. I LIKE THE FACT THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGES HIS LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST IN THE FOLD. HE IS UNDERRATED AND TALENTED . LOVE AND MISS YOU STEPHEN
4,Checkerboard cake set,This is a wonderful tool. It gets the job done; is economical and reasonably durable to re-use for several years if properly cared for.
5,Good quality bits,"The bit is exactly as described. Freud makes good quality cutting tools, and this bit was no exception.Not cheap, but worth the money."
3,On the boring side,Book was not put together very good. It was also very boring in alot of areas. The middle section that has pictures...fell completely out of the book and into my hands. Very bad binding job and cheaply made book. Would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,It doesn't come any better!,"Here in SW Florida, I find it difficult to locate spinach pastas. I've now ordered this pasta at least several times and I'm always more than satisfied...with the quality, the taste, the cost. What I especially like is the cooking time. This pasta seems to be ready for serving in about two-thirds the time other pasta takes. Ordering in quantities of six allows me to also share a bag or two or three with friends."
4,Not quite as advertised,"The pasta is fine, tastes very good and the package is plenty for 5-6 people. The problems I have are A) one of the bags arrived with a tear and some of the pasta was spilled inside the box and B) package says cooks in 3 minutes but that is NOT true. It takes about 10 minutes unless you like your pasta REALLY firm. The quick cooking was a major part of the reason I made this purchase so that, combined with the torn bag are the reasons I won't purchase again."
2,"OK, but did not function in my Eljer Titan",My Eljer Titan did not work well with this flapper. It closes too quickly resulting in insufficient flow to do a decent job of flushing. I just put it in my pile of flappers that didn't work. I am considering tossing the 11 year old toilet as getting parts is just a pain and going to Toto. I blame Eljer mostly for trying to retrofit a 1.6gpf feature in a toilet that wasn't designed for it.
5,Must have,"A year ago i started using ""Simply Yoga"" by Yolanda which i simply love I could feel the benefits instantly a sense of calm and well being.I went on to order her other two dvd's ""Yoga Easy""and ""Yoga 2 Easy""which have been amazing this is a ""must have"" collection !It's great for beginners and for those with a little more experience looking for a graceful stretch this is the dvd for you Yolanda is the best buy the dvd you wont be sorry ."
4,Gotta love the honest approach to tolerance!,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is obvious that the author has selected the most sincere questions and responses from what must be a great collection of sticky material. Some topics are amusing, some heartbreaking, but all of them are honest.Adding the opinion of experts on each topic provides a great summary, while still allowing the reader to ponder the question and arrive at his own conclusion, or at least arrive at a better understanding about persons different from himself.We need this book, if for nothing else, than to open our minds to understanding, tolerance and acceptance."
1,Mine had bugs and/or were stale! Them they sent more!@!,"Ordered with another chocolate product which was fine. The Monds looked like they had bugs or were stale, yuck. I am waiting for he replacement box and will update review then, customer service was EXCELLENT as always. I wish I could order everything through them! Update: They sent me a replacement which had bugs all through it!!! They haven't even pulled these!!!"
3,Hard to swallow,"The writing is good. The history and customs are interesting. The premise that a decorated cop is immediately suspected of a crime and disbelieved by friends and workers is difficult to grasp. Then come superhuman escapes and coincidence upon coincidence, and all the virtures are obscured. I turned the pages, but was sorely disappointed."
5,great resource,This book is great for anyone interested in learning more about yoga. It also offer gentle and advanced moves.
4,Great Examples,"In trying to relieve pain and stress, my doctors suggested yoga. I go to classes but wanted something at home so i could practice holds. This book gives very clear examples and has helped a lot.Hatha Yoga Illustrated"
4,Very Interesting,I had to order this book for a class and I must say that I have in fact found this very helpful.
4,Informative and easy to use,"As a yoga beginner, I wanted something that would show and explain the most common yoga poses that I do in my DVD sessions. This book does that in a clear, user-friendly manner. I keep it on hand to reinforce pose instruction and also to do occassional poses in isolation here and there. The beginning text is also interesting and motivating."
2,It was sent as a gift per a request of recipient,"Our grandaughter requested the book as a birthday gift. She received it, and we have heard no complaints; so, we assume it was satisfactory."
4,Hatha Yoga Book,"This book is perfect for a beginner like me, seeing the poses and reading how to perform them really helps. I can practice at home at my own pace without feeling inadequate. I like being able to use the routines in the back of the book too."
2,The content of the book if great but buy the printed version,"Despite books with a lot of formatting are usually suboptimal in the Kindle, this one includes a lot of tiny text comments embedded into the postures images. You can't zoom the images, and and least in my case it is very difficult if not impossible to read those comments. This is a great book, content is five starts, but buy the printed version."
4,Clear and precise instruction on Yoga poses,I enjoyed reading this book on a Yoga retreat trip. My yoga skills are at intermediate and the book is very helpful to augment the home practice.There are clear elaborations on different types of yoga and meditation which are concise but educational. The pose guide is definitely the highlight of the book. Each pose is dissected. The given written instruction and pictorial guidance helps a lot to get into and out of poses with gradual movement onto difficult poses.
5,Joanna MacGregor Scarlatti,"Joanna MacGregor does a beautiful job on this CD of playing music of Dominico Scarlatti in her own way. She uses the full spectrum of sounds of the Modern piano to make this music come alive with beautiful and intimate expression.I have quite a few recordings of the Scarlatti sonatas and I always come back to this one, it's a definite favorite.It saddens me that this item is so hard to get now, as it is really a wonderful recording of incredible, timeless music.If you are fortunate enough to get your hands on a copy, consider yourself lucky!"
4,Nice high end salt box,"This is a great marble salt box. I'm not sure that it's completely air tight if that's a concern, but it's close. It's also bigger than I thought, about 6 inches in diameter. Hinge seems like it's good quality."
5,Nice looking,This was a great addition to my kitchen. I have both the black and white. Great workmanship.
4,A Gift,"I received this swivel container as a gift. It is well made and has a nice weight to it. This is one of those items you see at yard sales and wonder, who the hell buys these things? A $20+ salt box? Why would you want this over a nice salt shaker?"
5,Excellent!,"In this volume Keitaro, Naru and Mutsumi visit Mutsumi's parents. But the promise comes into play again. Just when they think they are about to find who the promise was made to, the only person who can answer that question (Mutsumi), comes down with a severe case of amnesia. Not to mention the fact that in order to try to get her memory backtehy have to act out one of her fantasies. That fantasy just happens to be where the two get married. But very quickly things start to become very realistic... And finally for the second half of his classes Keitaro decides to study abroad in America with Seta. Can Naru come to terms with her feelings yet? Find out in this volume of Love Hina!"
4,I (Still) Love Hina!,"Ken Akamatsu, Love Hina, vol. 10 (Tokyopop, 2000)Keitaro and Naru are finally getting their relationship started. Or are they? We finally get to the root of Naru's indecisiveness, and of course Mutsumi has to show up again and complicate things... Love Hina has consistently been one of the best manga series I've read, and this issue is no different. Great stuff. ****"
5,Exactly what was expected,Product meant all expectation. This was a Christmas present for a 9 month old - she totally loved playing with it.
4,Very well made !!,"I bought this for my 9 month old baby for Christmas. She likes it. It has activities for each side. I think she may grow into liking it more. The dragon has a rattle in it which she likes. My only drawback is that I thought it would be bigger. I didn't pay attention to the size details. My baby can look at it like a book, not fit inside it !! My mistake. Otherwise, it is cute, well made and fun !"
5,A Fav Returns,"I first read this book in the mid 1950s. Then and now I enjoyed the author's deep insights into jazz, race, personalitiesand the culture of that world at that time. When I saw the book listed on Amazon I recalled whole passages which I had retained,not by memorization but by osmosis. Now I've got it back. ...Floyd Nower"
2,Object-oriented experts only need apply,"If you are making the gradual ascension into more complex Flash programming and want to explore the object-oriented approach then stay away. This is for programming experts only.If you are a professional programmer with a good amount of existing object-oriented skill then this might be what you are looking for.The examples used in this assume a very high knowledge of many of ActionScript's existing (and some would see as obscure) elements such as the drawing API . You end up trying to learn object-oriented concepts AND very complex unrelated material at the same time. It would be nice to start with simple examples that show the concepts and then build upon them.By chapter 3(of 12) I had enough, but forced myself through a few more and it all became a blur. Maybe after I learn OOP from another source I will come back to this one."
1,don't buy this juggalos,"this is not the anybody killa, ABK, this is another birth kult, ABK. ABK International actually, it is not bad rap, but dude looks goofy and he needs to change his name. mmfcl"
4,Up to speed Quickly,"This book, covers the early eras of digital photography in a succinct and concise manner."
2,Reconfigured Eye...,"An intresting book, however its language is so frustrating take some ginko before reading. The book is well researched and the images in it are phenomenal. The author has tried to prove his vast knowledge of the English language a little too forcefully. It is wordy and complicated to get through. If this is a required text for you, try and get a used copy, as you won't see the value out of it on the first read."
5,Hand Glaze,only material that really works removing swirl marks and light scratches in paint. down side is that is totally manual in application for best results.
4,from Minneapolis!,"this is very good music, and should be heard! You may like the REMIX CDof the songs, called Carbon Lily, a bumped up version of the songs."
3,Rent it first....,"When I first rented True Crime, I was very excited. The missions are either simple or impossible. What I don't understand is why in a mission, you can't just pull out your gun and use that!But still, True Crime also has lots of positive elements. I enjoy cuisin' in LA andarresting criminals. Yes, you can go on rampages, but it just isn'tthe same as GTA. Overall, this game is fun for about 2-4 days.Rent this game first and see what you think of it."
4,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is soooooo much better than the gta's the driving, shooting and fighting in this game is unbeleivable and its also funny! If you dont buy this game than you have nothing to live for:GRAPHICS-9/10GAMEPLAY-10/10SOUND-10/10OVERALL-10/10"
2,True Crime: Streets of LA,"Graphics aren't great, how many of the same person can you have walking down the street?? Game play not very realistic. I do not recomend anyone to buy this brand new. Rent it first then MAYBE by it used! GTA Vice City is much better."
4,TRUE DISAPPOINTMENT,"WARNING.....THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE. I HAD BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS GAME FOR A WHILE, SO WHEN I GOT A GAMECUBE I WALKED TO THE LOCAL BLOCKBUSTER THE NEXT DAY TO RENT IT. WHAT A LETDOWN. IT SEEMS AS IF THEY TOOK GTA, CHANGED A FEW THINGS, THEN PUT IT ON THE MARKET TO MAKE SOME MONEY. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THESE GOOD REVIEWS. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED AND IT REALLY SUCKS A$$. THEY SAY RENT IT, THEN BUY IT IF YOU LIKE IT. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR A GIFT CARD RENTING THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF @$#%.....IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MATURE TITLE ON THE GAMECUBE, GET HITMAN 2. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
2,5.0 out of 10,wuz up all GTA fans but if u're thinking this game is better than GTA3 or vicecity Ure WRONG....i have this game and i played it for 2 hours and is so boring the only thing that i good is the size of the city...is sos so so HUGE that's cool...but this game is as good as the getaway....lacks story ties..lacks of good weapons..and most of the city is pretty much the same I'll GIVE THIS GAME A 5 OUT OF TEN......DON'T BUY IT JUST RENT IT FIRST THEN BUY IT IF U LIKE IT...DON'T WASTE UR MONEY!
1,4 hours of gameplay not worth the price,"The maps of LA are cute. Except for all the strip malls that they put in where they haven't bothered to find out if it is a residential neighborhood or not.From start to finish, the game was done in under 4 hours. Not even worth the price of the game.Lackluster plot, limited fighting moves. The only thing that could be considered fun about the game is driving around the streets and taking over cars. If you want a game to do that, buy GTA, not this garbage."
4,Bad...Just plain Bad,"Pretty much, its just not good. Its reaLY a knock off of vice city. Get that or The Lord of the Rings if you want a GOOD game. Seriously, I know a lot about games and this game is just a stupid bad knock off."
2,Not so good.,Really fun game one of my favorites. It the game I bought was really badly scratched. When I played it would freez up and I couldn't play it. I could still hear the background music but that's it. It does this repeatedly so I don't even play it anymore.
3,Worth the Money,"Worth the $1.90 plus shipping that I paid.I gave it to my friend as a gift and he enjoyed it overall. The game is fun, but gets repetitive after a while."
3,Not worth a buy.,"I rented this game an after an hour of playing it I realised that it was a mesh of different genres put into one game. But it really hasnt been done well. The driving mechanics are similare to those of gta, the fighting system sucks, and the shooting is too simplistic. The story is horrible on top of that and the main character is an annyoying prick who digs up cliche lines that are suppose to be humurous. It plays second hand to gta but it's too repetitive none of ur missions have a clear objective and u just run, gun and fight ur way through a fairly short game. The story wasnt even immersive. I cant imagine buying this game, give it a rent first."
3,for black people olny,this game is too black for me but its good if you dont GTA but remember its for black people olny and im not black
2,Steve Ordhun,"GOD THIS GAME SSUX! IT'S NOT VIOLENT ENOUGH TO EVEN BE RATED m FOR MATURE. IF I COULD, I'DE GO KICK THE MAKER'S ASS!

I swear
5,"A Must - Have Game for Gamecube, Playstation 2, or X Box","True Crime: Streets of L.A. is a must have game for any of the three systems that it's out for. I totally disagree when people say that it's better than the Grand Theft Auto series. True Crime is different from GTA in several ways, whether it's shooting, driving, cuts-scenes, etc. However, it is the GTA look alike game for the Gamecube. It is a must have for all Gamecube owners. What really surprises me about the game is the 250 square MILES of L.A. re-created. What technology these days. Overall, if I was asked to say a few words about True Crime, i'd say,Freewill. Enjoy!"
3,fake crime and take your mama out to dinner BAD!,"First of all I'd like to point out that this game takes forever to load. Even for gamecube, for ps2, I'd understan, but gamecube.The graphics are like simple plan singing a love song to guys! I mean that in a bad way. It's a cool game but the game play is terrible, and the levels are short."
3,I was expecting a GTA and I got a game with every part of it's presentation flawed.,"Here's ten reason not to get this:1) Better games of the same genre are out, making this obsolete.2) No multi player or online play of any kind3) Slow motions is everywhere and it gets annoying.4) Repetitive! Driving, fighting, shooting, and none are done well.5) City looks bland.6) Sound track can be improved on completely.7) All there is to do is story mode8) Characters aren't at all lovable. They are annoying.9) Aiming system isn't that good10)Combat system is weak!"
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"This game could have been a whole lot better than it really is. The story line is interesting but some of the missions are just BORING. The missions that are the most boring is when you have to drive around following a car for at least 10 minutes, which gets really annoying. The graphics could have been better. If you arrest somebody on a hill when they fall to the ground half of their body sticks out. This game does not have alot of weapons that you can choose from. You can only hold 2 weapons at a time which is not that good. You have a variety of cars to choose from. But I would recommend a GTA game rather than this."
5,Don't Even Think About NOT Owning This CD,"This is simply the best CD since Lucinda Williams Car Wheels! Listen to it once and you will listen to it 100 times. Awsome voice,lyrics,music. How often can you get all three?"
5,Unlike anything you have heard before - buy this CD!,"When was the last time you listened to a CD and loved every track? The last time it happened to me was the first time I listened to ""The Joshua Tree"" and it hasn't happened since; until I played ""No Mermaid."" Sinead's beautiful voice, her prowess playing the guitar, and brilliant songwriting ability ranks her right at the top (and possible sets her apart) from the plethora of female pop singers. Although ""Whatever it takes"" and ""No Mermaid"" are the two songs getting the most press/airplay. I think Sinead particularly shines on ""Don't I know,"" ""Out of the woods,"" and ""People and Tables."" Finally, I recommend seeing her in concert before her popularity necessitates larger venues. I was fortunate to see her performance at the Somerville Theater (a small 900 seat theater a few miles outside of Boston) last week. Her performance was flawless (and she was seven months pregnant!). You will not be disappointed!"
2,not that impressed,"It's been done before.....and much better. This is a little too pop for me , but I do appreciate pop when it's done right (listen to xtc's latest)..Maybe she'll get some more depth as she matures."
4,"""No Mermaid""","A colleague of mine, a fellow music teacher, shared this CD with me because it had affected her so deeply. She and I are critical types, easily bored by sameness or gimmicks in music because we hear and make so much music daily. We both agreed this CD has everything going for it: Lyrics; instrumentation; singing style; a balanced combination of heart and guts. She spun the title track, ""No Mermaid,"" and the final track, ""Diving To Be Deeper,"" and I couldn't wait to plug it back in and hear the entire album.While the CD speaks eloquently to women (at least to these two), our spouses also enjoyed listening."
5,Buy this CD - see Sinead in concert!,"""No Mermaid"" is one of my favorite CD's from last year. Every song on the album tugs at your emotions. All of the songs are beautifully crafted and elegantly sung. You will not be disappointed! You will be equally satisfied if you get the chance to see her perform live. I am going to see Sinead at the Somerville Theatre (just outside of Boston) on September 28th and I cannot wait!"
5,Wonderful,"Hauntingly beautiful at times, this CD is a pleasure to listen to, beginning to end. Try listening without nodding your head to the beat....can't be done. I was lucky enough to pick this up at a garage sale, but will happily pay full price for her other CD's, knowing that she is consistantly original and enjoyable. Something for everybody in this fine sampling of her work."
1,Don't buy reeves oil pastels!,"This is a classic case of the axiom, ""you get what you pay for"". These are the cheapest oil pastels on the shelf because they are the lowest quality. There is not nearly enough oil in them and them come off looking like kindergarten crayons. They won't adhere the paper properly, they won't smudge or even out, and are far messier than any other oil pastels I've ever used. Spend a few more bucks on a better set, you won't be sorry. As for the ones I bought, they're going to the salvation army donation box at earliest opportunity."
4,VERY HELPFUL!,"This book goes hand-in-hand with Laura Robb's, ""Teaching Reading in Middle School."" The activities and lessons that she presents in the mentioned book are available in this book. All you have to do is copy the page - everthing else is done for you! Although you do not need to purchase ""Teaching Reading in Middle School"" it will be helpful to see how Laura Robb implements the assessments and record keeping forms."
1,Totally misled about this horrible film ...,"Anyone who's looking for a Tony Jaa action flick will terribly disappointed by this movie. It's totally misleading the way it's advertised featuring Tony. Tony has a very MINOR role in this film. As for it being a schlocky ""B"" film, it's ok. Some of the action was decent at best however that's as good as it gets. The story was boring and the acting was even worse. Production value was barely there. I wouldn't recommend this film at all unless you're absolutely bored with time to waste."
3,not the best of his flicks,"I have a feeling that this became available after the success of Tony Jaa's other movies, it's an early work and some other guy is actually the star. It reminds me of other early asian martial arts movies."
2,CRAPPYDOOO!!!!!!!,"NEVER EVEN SEEN TONY JAA TILL THE END!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM.,IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Worth seeing,Tony Jaa is in about only 10 minutes of the film but it is 10 minutes worth watching; he was amazing even at 17/18. The story line is interesting and I enjoyed watching the entire film. Jaa picked a great mentor and with this film you can tell why. The picture quality is not always the best but you can get past it. Remember this film was made about 12 to 13 years ago and the Thai film industry was just beginning to figure things out. After watching Ong-Bak and Tom Yum Goong you can see just how far they have come and how they are beginning to rival Hong Kong. I don't think Tony Jaa needs Hollywood. Looking forward to more of Panna and Jaa's early work being released to the U.S.
2,Boo!,"I purchased this DVD for my husband. We watched it, but didn't make it all the way through the movie, because the plot was atrocious. It tended to drag, and the fight scenes weren't even good enough to say that Tony Jaa was a part of them. Overall, I'd say skip this movie and watch ong-Bak 2 to truly enjoy Jaa's skills."
1,Not a Tony Jaa movie...terrible flick too,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I go for a martial arts movie I am looking for fighting. A good story line and acting is a plus but I want fists flying.This movie fails in every possible way. Poor story, lousy acting, lousy filmography...oh and I couldn't find Tony Jaa anywhere in this movie. The fight scenes were flat and had no style...they looked like bar brawls than martial arts.This is a Panna Rikkikrai movie, he's one of the main characters. Don't be fooled by the cover, you won't find Tony or his style here. I wouldn't even rent this, it's that bad."
1,Don't buy this Movie!,"Tony Jaa is on the DVD cover, but I couldn't find him in the film! If Tony Jaa is in this movie, it must be a brief cameo. This movie was really poorly made, poorly acted... and has really cheesy martial arts in it. This film was marketed with ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"", two really awesome films... and they even charged more for this piece of crap! Their marketing ploy is a total rip-off!"
1,Do not fall for it!!!!!,This movie is wack Jaa is only in it for 30secs so they repackaged it off the strength of his better films. If I could give it no stars I would. Don't make the same mistake I did! If you do it will be a one watcher film turned dust collector unless you trick someone else into buying it from you....
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!,They have tony jaa all over cover but he is only in the movie for like 5 min. they didn't even use the same film for the movie... just a waste of money... but even worse its a waste of time
3,A little Jaa?,"This movie, though good in the classic Kung Fu movie set, is no Ong Bak. It features the amazing athelete that is Jaa's mentor , but very little Jaa. This wouldnt be a huge deal but the cover art prominently featuring Jaa is mighty misleading. Neither of the shots ever happens in the movie. If you are a Kung Fu fan and a Jaa freak this is for you, otherwise go watch Ong Bak or Tom Yum Goong."
2,It Sucked,All I can say is it sucked. I don't remember seeing Tony Jaa. I'll give this movie away for free.
4,Don't be fooled by reviews,"This movie gets a bad wrap because of the Lack of Tony Jaa. He's in it for like 30 seconds and he's all over the cover of the DVD. Then again if you didn't notice everything from the DVD cover with Tony is from other movies. That being said, Spirited Killer is a really good movie. If you like kung fu movies you will most likely enjoy this. It has a 70s/80s style kung fu movie to it but with a totally original story to it.Plus the features on the DVD are great, shows a lot of clips from other Thai action movies that look totally fun an awesome."
1,Lame!!,"If you're Tony's fan, DON'T BUY THIS CHEATING DVD. I'm from Thailand and I'm so disappointed in this stupid DVD. I bought it from WalMart 'cause I thought that it was a new Tony's movie. It turns out a real old movie that shot by Tony's producer long long time ago with a stupid location and cheap actor and actress."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I thought the movie was gonna be way better than it was. A little disappointing and the fighting and action wasn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Good for a laugh,"This movie was pretty terrible. I never did see Tony Jaa, and he was the reason I bought it. I noticed later that the picture on the back of the DVD case was taken straight from The DVD case of ""Ong Bak"". The camera quality was terrible, as was the editing and overall acting. There were times when the camera shot would turn a shade of blue, then red, then regular. I can say, however, that my friends and I shared a good laugh over how terrible this movie is."
5,Great author!,I've been an avid listener to Dave Edwards for many years. He always has something relavent to say and is hilarious! This book teaches a great new way to view God and His opinion of life. It's definitely a book you could read over and over.
4,ways for Loving Fully & Living Freely,"It is written from heart. There are lot of stories, real life events and observations. The single theme is GOD is love. In strict theological terms, it is vedantic or zen buddhist kind. In the chapter on Undoing unworthiness, he rejects the sinner concept of Christanity. There are lot of page length poems of deep meaning. There are some interesting diagrams. It is a book one can read again and again atleast parts of it. Discussion on Jesus in the chapter Dancin' up the path is interesting. It reminds Capras's urge to equate Siva's dance and quantum vibrations."
4,The Dragon Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"The content of the book was very good. The book was written and highlighted the entire way through, and had the jacket torn in the upper right corner. It was not stated to be new, and did not interfere with the content. Couldn't beat the price. I'm well satisfied."
4,Dragons live,This book is one I will keep as it speaks of his search through different religious paths and what he learned on his journey. There are essays and daily meditations included.
3,Good for those starting on the healing path,I thought I would enjoy Cohen's work but have decided that it is not my cup of tea or reading!I have passed this book on to a women's shelter as well.
3,The quote about hunger was wonderful;,"Considering the fact that I did not entirely read the book, i can not ilberally write such a review. But, the part about the man feeding the people was very helpful in explaining my civic consciousness project, a hunger awareness project."
5,Great painting book by Thomas Kinkade for Artists,This great book is by Thomas Kinkade. My wife does Oil/Acrylic/Watercolor painting. She loved this book. It helped her to practice the techniques used in the paintings. Colors used in the books were very romantic as the title of the books says.
2,expensive but cheaply made,"I purchased this single pair of/hard to find, flare leg panties at the same time I ordered a 3 pair pkg deal of similar but cheaper brand. I thought this more expensive single item might be better quality, better material etc. This product was more expensive, thinner material, without the double panel and other features of cheaper brand. Just glad I didn't order more."
5,just what I wanted,"I needed a measuring device that would not glare with the flash from the camera. This handy tool is perfect in every way.- Large readable numbers for accurate measuring.- Does not retract on you, you have to manually push it back into the holder.- Very good quality - will last as long as you will most likely need it."
5,just love it,Just love the big letters and how tape will stand by itself for photo measurements. Just wish it has a belt clip built in it.
2,A Dubious Work,"No matter what the editors' & contributors' intent was or wasn't with this ""New History"", it has failed and disqualified itself by ignoring the following writers, to name only those that loom largest: Angelus Silesius, Johannes Beer, Hoffmann v. Hoffmannswaldau, Hebel, Lenau, Platen, Morgenstern, Lasker-Schueler, Robert Walser, Tucholsky, Arno Schmidt, Wolfgang Koeppen, Doderer, Erich Kaestner, Strittmatter, Aichinger, Bobrowski. Women writers are largely absent, as well as the literature of exile.Is one to find solace for these omissions by noting 26 references for Hitler in the index? No, this is not a 'new' history, this is not a 'history' at all."
2,Excellent Louis; lousy recordings,"As always, Louis and his band are in fine shape, playing with love and respect for Dixieland music. My problems lie with the engineering. It's doubtful if any major label would have issued these recordings. Many of the musicians are way off the microphone on some tracks. You strain to hear them, then Louis cuts loose directly into the microphone and knocks you backwards. There is blurring and other types of distortion here and there. And, most annoying of all, many of the songs are faded out halfway through. The short time (about 41 minutes) makes me think these tapes were originally prepared to cut LPs. But, what did I expect to get for $2.98?"
3,"Loved Cybil Sitcom, Not so Much for the CD","I loved Cybill when she did this show, love the reruns on Lifetime. Her voice made me buy this cd yet I was disappointed. Not with her singing she does have a nice voice, but it wasn't what I expected. Had I known it was a minute song or two minute or what I purchased I wouldn't have bought it. I thought it would have her singing with Tony Bennett ""Nice work if you can get it"" not commercials she did on the show which were cute then but not on an album. Cybill I have bought your other cd's after purchasing this and the other albums show your range, this one wasn't worth the money except for one song, Doris Day had sung""Secret Love"""
3,Beware of Bosch Service,I have a Bosch washer and had to replace the motor after 3 years. I had to wait 2 weeks for the Bosch service rep to come (NYC) and then another 3 weeks for the motor. I am still waiting...Their response and service is degrading.
5,Wonderful,"I bought this book because it written by Watase, I LOVE Watase. All her manga has been really good except for Ceres, though I've read that too. I picked bought it, I read it, I WANT MORE! It was really good but not Watase's normal stuff, there was no killer Celestial maidens, no magical books, or ""Inner Heart"", No magic at all! Very non-Watase, and no violence, but I loved it, very cute and happy. But I warn you later on Imadoki gets more dramatic and Soap Opera-ish. The artwork was wonderful and the main character was Wonderful, I highly recommend Imadoki to any Watase fan, or any manga fan at all!"
2,They should pay ME to watch this.,"Unless you want to pay to see a 30-minute commercial for Mid-South Institute, and a little bit of shooting, don't go near this tape. If they'd called it ""Mid-South Institute,"" that would have at least been more accurate, but to call it ""Shooting Disciplines""...well, that's stretching it waaaay too much. The ten or so minutes that John Shaw spends with the shotgun and MP5 are impressive, but it's hardly worth the price of the tape. The production is bad, sound is bad, lighting is awful--there's a pretty good commercial for another ""Train Hard, Fight Easy"" video at the end, but none of this justifies the blatant mislabeling."
3,Rietbergen as a teacher vs Rietbergen as a writer,"As a student of the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, I had the honour to have a course given by P.Rietbergen. I enjoyed the classes very much for you must know that this writer is a brilliant story-teller who really takes you into the subjects he's telling about. This is a book you should read in your own free time and for your own development but not for study. Mister Rietbergen gives you a very clear image of the ancient times with not just the boring facts but with imagery and all, like in a novel. A very agreeable book, but one thing I found a pitty; Mr Rietbergen should have written it or in Dutch or, have it translated in English/American style. But that's my opinion. When you want to know more of Europe's history without having to read boring books, take this one!"
4,"God's Name, John 1:1,","This review is of the 1909 Third Edition. Edited and partly revised by Ernest Hampden-Cook, M.A.This edition uses LORD all capitals in certain quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures such as at Acts 2:21 where it quotes from Joel and Acts 2:25 where it quotes from Psalms.In the first six verses of chapter 19 of Revelation he uses ""Hallelujah"" four times along with the footnote on the first occurrence indicating the meaning of this word is ""Praise Jah"", Jah""being a contracted form of the name Jehovah.""At John 1:1 he mistranslates ""the Word was God.""There may be some variation in different re-prints of this Bible translation."
3,Missing Gay Persons,"Photography is not just pictures. It is the representation of icons that help us understand our world. For older people, a picture of them during their youth represents how they see themselves despite their age. Pictures are a reflection of how we see ourselves. It is rare for a book to position itself as a reflection of the gay community. I was thrilled to see that such a book existed. The pictures are fantastic and the biographies were very real. What troubled me was that there was not one image of an African-American woman. Asian-Americans were not represented either. I strikes me as strange that not one representative from these groups could be found at Gay Pride in NY. The selection of representative members of the Gay Community smacked only of the element that is present in the mainstream community, racism. It is noble to archive and document this community; it is a disservice to omit some of its members."
3,not exactly Darkthrone's BEST album.....,"... I like Darkthrone purely for their black metal releases, so this album disappointed me. I'd say 70% of this album is early death metal work (from their demos, soulside journey, and some live stuff) the rest is from their other releases (A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Transylvanian Hunger, and Under a Funeral Moon). There are 2 unreleased tracks (Neptune Towers and Iconoclasm Sweeps Cappadoria) but they are also Darkthrone's early death metal work. This album is not for fans out there that like Darkthrone for their black metal work. Personally, it would be much more worth it to buy the individual black metal albums by them instead of buying this cd. BUT if you're into Darkthrone for their early death metal work then this is the choice for you. Hope this helped (or warned) some people."
3,Good music - terrible recordings,"I am sure everyone will agree that Darkthrone's finest compositions are included here. However, the most annoying thing is production. While we can get used to listening to a badly produced CD to feel more evil (HA!),getting used to songs from 4 differently produced albums really reduces the entertainment value. In fact, it becomes outright annoying to keep adjusting your stereo to different production levels. This is what reduces the rating from 5 stars (for songs) to 3 stars (for extremely annoying production).I would give this a miss and just go for all of darkthrone's albums instead and listen to them individually."
5,Understanding Lebbeus,"Lebbeus Woods is the master architect: his theoretical explorations and investigations lay as exhibits that modern architects pull and borrow for their own artistic palate. His investigations are rooted in deep concepts that are difficult to follow at times, but understanding his drawings and his attempts are easily understaning his genius. The politcal connections he pulls from are all relevant and his drawings are indescribably beautiful, very active with the reader, exciting and full of life and vibrance."
4,The Wonderful World of Classical Music,This is a great bargain! A nice selection of classical music for the beginner or anyone who enjoys varied music (perfect for loading onto an IPod). The quality is very good and the breadth of the collection is impressive.
3,Good but Deer Hunter is better,"This is a pretty good hunting game, but I would have thought that Activision would have tried to better Ataris Deer Hunter and they haven't. There is still no online mode ! and no multiplayer. The graphics in Deer Hunter are better too. A good game if you already have deer hunter but I if not. I would get Deer Hunter instead cos even after a year it still has more features."
3,"Ok, but unrealistic.","Especially the last few missions ... come on - when is that last time that you tried to shoot a deer from AT LEAST 200 YARDS AWAY! Whatever happened to get close, take a careful shot, etc. If you don't have the ORIGINAL Dangerous Hunts - get that one instead."
2,big game hunter is MUCH better,I think this game is so frustrating. You will be hunting white tailed deer and all of a sudden you get attacked by a wolf!!! I mean this is DEER HUNTER not wolf / deer hunter. The funnest part of this game is the cabins. They're cool. That's the only reason I give this game 2 stars.
3,ok game,This game is ok but it is really slow moving. Everything scares the deers so you have to let them come to you. If you want a good hunting game buy Cabela's Dangerous Hunts.
1,Time to burn...,"Sit behind the tree, with your gun, waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Stand up, get a bag of chips and a can of pop. Don't bother to hit the pause button. Just wait. Soon a deer will show up. But it's the wrong type. So let it go. And wait. And wait. And ignore the fox and other animals who walk right up to you. You're deer hunting.If I was training myself to hunt real deer or if I was already a deer hunter or if I was brain damamged I might find a reason to play this game a lot more. But I could never enjoy it. There is no real adventure, no heart pounding action, no challenge. At least the Big Game Hunter game has animals stalking and attacking you!I've found deer trapped by the landscape, not able to even run. Or they just run at you or by you or stop and eat grass while you take aim. Why make a hunting game if you're going to have rules and fines!?!?!In other words it is either too hard or too easy and ALL boring."
2,Beyond just rubbish,"This is a very poor sequel to the best film ever made!(for me) The buckets of water being thrown at the 'jenny' remind me of the 'generation game'! No worse. Nothing fits the origional exept the upsidedown bit, I'm suprised that these actors can show themselfs in public! Its so rediculously funny that its really a must see!"
3,Action Packed Film!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is an excellent well done movie. Sally Field was a great actress in this movie. This movie is worth buying. But please be sure to get the 1st part of the movie first, so you know what is going on. But if you are in for an action packed movie (like me) go on ahead and buy it. Enjoy!!!!!!"
3,Beyond the Poseidon Adventure. Decent.,"I think Michael Caine and even Telly Savalas holds the movie together,Sally Fields shouldn't have been in it.Slim Pickens was good too,the action? For it's time mediocre,The movie isn't exactly outstanding but as I mentioned the Main Characters are what hold it best."
2,Annoying movie,"The DVD quality was fine, but the movie was boring and unnecessary. I loved the original, so I was hoping this sequel would be good but is wasn't. There wasn't anything original about it, and I couldn't wait for it to end."
1,Unseaworthy sequel.,"I do not know what possessed Irwin Allen to do a sequel to the superb Poseidon Adventure. The plot alone is absurd, as Captain Mike Turner (Played by Michael Caine) tries to salvage the capsized Poseidon with Sally Fields and Karl Malden in tow. Telly Savalas plays Stefan Svevo, a terrorist posing as a doctor to help with any survivors. His intentions are less than honorable as he is after a shipment of plutonium in the Poseidon's holds. Plutonium! When does the military ship weapon grade plutonium on a Carnival cruise! Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, and Slim Pickens round out the cast. The film is a waste of incredible talent on a sequel that should of stayed on the bottom of the ocean. Rescue yourself from this one by not seeing it."
2,Not a very good movie!,"It is pretty hard to make a sequel about an capsized ocean liner, anyway. There are a lot of things which don't make sense. First, they bring the ship's nurse back! Didn't she drowned with the people who went forward in the last film? Besides that who would want to go in a sinking ship anyway? Not I! The truth is you are better off to wait until it comes on tv. There are better films to buy!"
2,WHERE'S SHELLEY AND STELLA?,NOT VERY GOOD SEQUEL TO THE BEST DISASTER MOVIE OF ALL TIME. WITHOUT STELLA CLIMBING AROUND IN THOSE PUMPS AND SHELLEYS PANTIES THIS JUST ISN'T NEAR AS GOOD.
1,Terrible Beyond Imagination,"With the phenomenal success of ""The Poseidon Adventure"", the first disaster movie of its kind, the sequel was sure to be a hit. Not so. A plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great. Having a leading lady (Sally Fields) fresh from an Oscar win and a few veteran actors (Michael Caine, Karl Malden), might also sound promising. Unfortunately, the magic of the set production of the original is not even close. Instead of upside ballrooms, barber shops, kitchens and bathrooms, the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes. The rest of the cast is comprised of television actors, who are as wooden as the script. There's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous, you won't even laugh in disbelief. Irwin Allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel. Considering the original, that's a terrible shame."
1,Even the sharks would hate it,"could not watch it . Painful acting, ridiculous concept. Bouncing curls and clorox clean suit while cimbing into a submerged ocean liner, explosions all around you .. who wouldn't?????"
3,Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,"This sequel has two salvage parties boarding the Poseidon hoping to retrieve some valuables from the wreck. Soon they find themselves trapped and voila: you've got the same story again: they need to get out. Add one plot twist where Telly Savalas turns out not to be a good guy (don't say I spoiled it, you could figure that out yourself). Add some cheesy scenes with Sally Field crying and Michael Caine calling her a monkey, and Jack Warden playing a blind surviving passenger and you've got a slightly enjoyable but not very good movie. ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" doesn't live up to its predecessor, but is entertaining enough and interesting as a curiosity piece."
3,Beyond the Poseidon Adventure still floats,"Captain Michael Turner (Michael Caine) lost his cargo overboard in the storm that capsized the Poseidon. Now strapped for cash, he and his crew of Sally Field and Karl Malden descend with their little tug onto the crippled hulk of the Poseidon to claim salvage rights. Complications arise when Telly Savalas and his crew of ""paramedics"" also arrive, and the two camps set up an uneasy alliance. Of course, Telly and company are terrorists looking to retrieve their shipment of plutonium aboard the ship. That causes trouble aside from all the exploding metal and rushing water. Caine and his people find some survivors, including obnoxious Peter Boyle, blind Jack Warden, drunken Slim Pickens, and friendly nurse Shirley Jones. Unecessary but enjoyable bubble gum fare. A critical and commercial failure, Michael Caine learned enough from this experience to star in ""Jaws the Revenge."""
1,This is a dumb movie; don't waste your time watching it,"I like ship movies. This one was just a big waste of time. Bad acting by every member of the cast, flimsy story line. After about 15 minutes of the movie, I realized that I would get just as much out of it if I watched most of it on ""fast forward"". I wish I could sell this or get my money back from the person I bought it from. The original Poseidon Adventure was enough. It did not need this sequel."
2,BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE,This is a fair movie to watch and a must have for anybody who wants to comeplet there POSEIDON ADVENTURE movie set this movie puicks up after the first group of people is taken off the upside down ocean liner the movie is fair but not is good as the first one.
2,Boring,"This movie is soooooo boring. But, if you're a Poseidon fan, you should still see it. But even then, it will still be boring."
3,Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,Not as good as the first one but I liked it. I have watched it a few times the value in this film is if your having a Poseidon move night and you wanna watch them all. As a stand alone not the best movie but for the price you'll get some entertainment out of it.
2,For fans of disaster movies only,"I grew up watching these all star disaster movies and even if this one is bottom of the barrel, it's fun to watch. If you want something that makes sense look someplace else,but if very bad disaster movies are your thing then kick back and enjoy."
3,Beyond the Poseidon Adventure,Not as great as the first movie but it's ok you gotta see just because it's a the seqel to the orignal
2,Unworthy Sequel,"In 1978, when film critic Roger Ebert interviewed Irwin Allen, the mega-producer suggested a potential story idea for a planned sequel to ""The Poseidon Adventure""...The survivors of the Poseidon disaster would be rescued and taken to land in Italy where they would be placed on a train which would go through a tunnel in the Alps. The tunnel would collapse and everyone would be trapped under the mountain. Ebert thought it was an excellent idea. And as it turns out Mr. Allen should have went with it. Because the movie he wound up making is an idiotic waste of time; ranks among the worst sequels ever made; and marked the beginning of the end of Allen's reign as the ""Master of Disaster."" Side note: Allen directed this mess and, as ""Beyond TPA"" star Michael Caine said in his autobiography, good ol' Irwin should have stuck to producing! Worth a look for ""Poseidon"" fans, but that's about it."
2,Fun to watch! Better than the last 2 remakes!,"In 2004 we had the made for TV remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"". In 2005 we had the mega-budget remake ""The Poseidon"". However there was this little known sequel that was made by the master of disaster himself Irwin Allen! The remakes were just bad! However don't miss this one! This picks up ""The Morning After"" the original ends! 3 people go into the ship to salvage items from the safe. Also joining them is a group of terrorist who are after well I don't want to give away too much more. Its lots of fun to see this movie! Its very campy!"
2,not very accurate,"These were a great price, but were not consistently accurate. They show a negative reading where it should read positive. I found an old review online of someone else who had this problem. The ReliOn brand I get from Walmart are better, a little more expensive. I did compare the two several different times."
1,Don't Bother buying these test strips!!,"These urinalysis strips repeatedly gave a negative result, even though I knew I was in ketosis. As a test I used Ketostix and these test strips at the same time. The Ketostix indicated ketone, these strips didn't. I tossed them in the garbage. I guess you get what you pay for . . . oh well!"
4,It works.,"I think they work. Make sure you hit the basket when throwing them out. Otherwise, your signifigant other will be pissed.If you drink lots of water, I think it dilutes your urine not showing a true result. I think that may be the case with any strips."
5,Works,The strips work and are well packaged. I use them to keep track of ketosis on Atkins. They're definitely helpful.
3,Good price but packaging needs work,"It's a good price for pee sticks, I bought to support my low carb diet that is supposed to put me in ketosis.My one major complaint is the font they used on the bottle, especially when reading the test strip. I had to find my magnifying glass to read the numbers by the color chart. This really bugs me in cases like this, where they had loads of room to use a regular sized font. It almost seems intentional."
4,ketone strips,I bought these to use when I was on the Akins diet. they were very helpfull. they worked great. I could not have done it with out them
2,Non-dairy = funky taste!,"I've been drinking these Sweet Success shakes every morning for a while. The Sweet Success Vitatein shakes in vanilla and chocolate are both great and I wish I could say the same for this product because I'd hoped the non-dairy shake would be just as good, but truthfully, this shake has a semi-bitter and unnaturally odd aftertaste. My husband and I both tried to choke these down, but wound up getting rid of close to half a case because we were both dreading drinking them every morning.If you can tolerate dairy, stick with the regular Vitatein shakes."
3,Interesting piece on religious conflict,"In this book about Chinese history of the T'ang Dynasty, Cooney seems to be the writer and Altieri the interpreter of the art work which plays an important part.The story follows Magistrate Dee Hen-chie from his role as a young assistant to his work as Chief Magistrate in solving murders. The authors blend the details to string the story along effeectively.The events are played against the background of China's only ruling empress and the incursion of Buddhism into Chinese life. The sometimes conflicting philosophies of Buddhism and Confucianism is seen in how government work and laws are created and applied.This story is mainly a good detective piece with an exotic background and an esoteric milieu of religion causing havoc to logic. The authors keep the long story riveting as it tkaes fifty plus years to develop."
4,7th Century Tang Dynasty China,"This story uses what is known about the real 7th century Tang Dynasty magistrate Judge Dee Jen-chieh, who is more popularily known as the Judge Dee created by Robert Van Gulik. Van Gulik's Dee, however, was eroneaously placed in the much later Ming Dynasty and this is more accurate to the Tang. We include this story because of the key involvement of the Empress Wu Zetian in the plot. Wu's particularly nasty side is highlighted in this story, and the good judge labors often in vain against the corruption, betrayal and perversion of Tang Dynasty political life. There is excellent additional information on the Empress in the author's postscript. A caveat: While the details of the setting and historical events are valuable, this is not a book for younger readers."
1,review,"I am a PH.D candidate of Wuhan University, China.My research field is rice gene isolation and clone. So I want to buy this book."
3,Ok...,"I was very dissapointed with the quality of the addam's family section, and the Munster's wasn't as good as I expected. Way to short only 30 minutes each!"
2,Pro Fishing?,"First I understand that the title is Rapala but please. For choices of rod/reel selection there are no baitcasters... what's up with that. Secondly the weight of the fish versus the drag setting is a joke, I fish numerous tournaments and have never had a 5 to 6 lb Largemouth bass break my line with my drag set as tight as it can go, yet it happens in this game. The actuall setting of the hook well as the other reviews point out it is pretty much random as there is no skill here, there always seems to be way to much slack in the line. There is no changing the speed of which you reel-in just start or stop. Lastly the amount of lake available to fish is really pathetic. At least for the price, you only out 20 dollars."
5,Great fun!,Great selection of rods/reels and fish to go after. Graphics are good. We play in a big group and its always fun. Drag is fine .. we never have problems. There's lots of fishing games we've tried but always come back to this one.
2,it's ok,"This product is just ok. It does sting when you put it on so do not do so if you have chapped lips as I would imagine that it would hurt a lot. It increases the staying power of your lipstick by only a little. Not that much better than nothing. The price is inexpensive, but it cost just as much for shipping so I can't say that I would purchase this product again."
2,Lipstix Lipstick Sealer,"In my opinion, Lipstix Lipstick Sealer does not work at all. Every time I have coffee, I have lipstick on the cups and I have to wipe it off. I used another product for 15 years. I am very disapointed in this product."
2,Wish it was not a roller ball,"WHile the product itself is decent, the roller ball design is very poor. it constantly sticks and actaully takes off lipstick vs sealing it. They shoudl have used a brush instead. I would not buy this item again unless they replaced ör vastly improved the functionality of the roller ball."
2,verismo,"Another inadequate live performance of Giordano's opera. It may be a little better than the earlier version with Zambon however Jeong-Won Lee does not seem to be able to count or come in on time. I felt sorry for Benzi, the conductor."
5,I wish this was out a year ago!,"I have read just about every presentation, white paper, and web page there is on vertex and pixel shaders. Now I am kicking myself for having not just waited for this book to come out. It fills in all the gaps, and is full of tricks I never would have thought of on my own."
5,This is a great true adventure story for everyone.,"Helen Thayer is an amazing woman who inspires us to overcome negative thoughts when faced with difficult challenges. Her adventure is fascinating and exciting. I had a hard time putting this book down. My wife and children have all read this book and loved it too. If you want an exciting true-life adventure story, this is the one. Very inspirational and motivational."
5,Best Book,"Best book I read in a long time, couldn't put it down! A must read for those who love true adventure.Bonnie"
4,I like this video,"I really like this video, and many of Kathy Smith's videos. Even though I consider myself between beginner and intermediate, I am able to modify the moves and follow this video. Kathy Smith almost always shows ways of modifying the workout to your fitness level. There is about one six minute segment that I will fast forward, because she gets a little crazy and hard to follow, but the other 55 minutes is a great workout. As I get better, I'll do the whole tape. I also own her functionally fit, kickboxing, step aerobics (from 1992), and her beginner's yoga video. My favorite is the step aerobics from 1992."
4,where the band showed how to blues,"This CD was the first record of LF I happened to hear. The music represented is classical progressive rock of the 70's with all those keyboards, violins and stuff. The groups to be compared are King Crimson, Uriah Heep, Atomic Rooster. The song HOBO is more than a bit like Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" though the rest of the musical content is highly professional and unique. Such songs as ""Where the Grouppies Killed the Blues"", ""Mother"" and ""Burnig Ships"" can without any doubt be called progressive-rock classics. Marvellous singing of John Lawton (later the member of Uriah Heep), Zappa-styled solos of the guitarist Peter Hesslein, strange bass sounds and crazy rythms of drums made me the fan of the band. So, you may need some time to understand this record but if you do -- you won't regret."
3,A Flawed History of Hell's Fringe and Its Denizens,"Glenn was an Oklahoma Lawman and as such his predjudice keeps this book from being as good as it could be. Your reviewer is the son of Oklahoma bootleggers and a descendent of a Doolin gang member...as you read the book notice how many times Marshalls supposedly call from perfect ambush positions..""hands up""....For someone who has seen Oklahoma law enforcement at close range I find those scenarios tough to swallow....not that I blame the Marshalls for this, these outlaws were desparate men and have already killed 3 marshalls in a direct confrontation in Ingalls....to his credit he does show the importance of informers as opposed to smart detective work...all in all if he wasn't so ready to swallow whole all the Marshalls accounts this would be a better book..but then in so many instances the lawmen were the only surviving witnesses"
1,Didn't fit my camera,If you need the Kodak Klic-8000 for your camera do yourself a favor and just order the Kodak battery. Very disappointed batter was too large for my Kodak Z712 IS camera. Had to bang the camera to get the batter out. Don't buy this one.
3,Only one problem.. it's a tight fit,"They work great! They were even charged and read to go out of the box, the only problem, which was previously mentioned on a review, is they are a tight fit! I had to get something to pull out the battery. Everything else is great, but .. you will need something to pull it out.."
4,Satisfied,The Wiha Slotted screwdriver we have had a different number on the handle so when ordering the Wiha 30817 Slotted Screwdriver I was so glad is was what we were looking for. Very happy with the product.
1,Yawn.,"I usually give the book a good chance, but after 300 pages and it still isn't good?? I had to donate it to the library !!"
3,important? in it's own way...,"I don't quite know what to say about this. John Ford is an important director. I suppose this is important historically speaking, but it is very racist. It's propoganda, and not against the enemy, but against out own people. This is the type of work that allowed us to have our deterrment camps. On the plus side, Huston, who plays Uncle Sam, does argue that they are Japanese-Americans are as American and as loyal as any other. But we have Mr. C., which is U.S.'s conscience telling us different. I'd like to think that the rational side won the arguement in the film, but we know from history it didn't. And the film ended with our people as the enemy."
5,a brilliant and unique classic exegetical masterpiece,"Brilliantly written and insightfully rich exposition of the New Testament. Unlike any other modern day N.T. commentary. Lenski is a master of Greek grammar and unwavering in his high view of Scriptural authority. His analysis bring the text of the New Testament to light. He probes deeply and passionately arguing his conclusions masterfully. His conservative Lutheran persuation assures a clear, unbiased perspective. A classic that all preachers of God's word will use over and over."
5,great screw driver,"This is a great screw driver, it is on of the tool in my small kitwith this and a chanel lock plyers you can repair most things"
1,Not what I expected,"I thought this book would be more in-depth as to what future employers looked for when hiring recent graduates. For example, what to major in, in order to improve their chances of landing a good job. Instead it was redundant in its advice. Anyways, it was not worth paying for a bunch of advice that did not pertain to what the title suggested, ""...an employer's perspective"""
5,Back support,I have had two of these belts over the last 10 years. They are great to guard against back injury when lifting moderate weight or when your lifting technique is not optimum. The sizing is accurate as well. I am a 32-34 waist and the medium size was correct.
2,Another disappointment from MoS,"Although you get alot of songs for $25, you get a lot of garbage which has been typical from MoS in the past two years. The best songs are from the album that features hits from the past. You can't really go wrong there. You'd be better downloading the 10 good songs from iTunes and saving $15."
2,seat covers for very small car seats,"the seat covers are short in length. so, either part of seat or headrest are not covered (your choice). the pile hight is 1/2 inch [some of other brands seat covers have it 1 inch]. because of rubberized back, it holds in place well."
2,poor backing and straps,The straps that holds the seat cover to the seat doesn't keep the seat covers in place. This has caused the back of the seat to fold under. Now the rubber backing has creases that make the seat backs uncomfortable.
1,You get what you pay for?,"I have to agree... I am returning mine. I ordered 2 of these seatcovers. One feels silky and pulls like nylon... the other feels rough like wool. However, both have the consistancy of a synthetic. There was a faded stain on one (maybe someone tried to clean it?). And another thing... the color does not match when comparing the 2.IMHO, If it is fur (I doubt it), then it is fur from 2 different species of animal. And I doubt either of them were sheep.sorry to say this... But, A very poor quality item. This was a gift for my girlfriend. Which is a bummer. Oh well, I'm sure I can find a replacement."
2,sheepskin seat covers,"The quality of the covers is good, however they don't even come close to fitting over the headrest area as shown in the ad. It looks funny on my HHR bucket seats. Works okay but not what I thought I was buying. Cost factor good it's just too bad they don't fit like the add shows."
5,Works great!,This was a replacement cover for my wife's car. She had trouble with another type that kept slipping around on her car seat. This one stays put and looks great.
5,I was able to find what I was looking for...,"After searching countless stores looking for the only powder that doesn't make my face breakout, I realized I could amazon it. It was easy to find online and arrived quickly."
5,GOOD PERFORMANCE OF FREUD CUTTING SAW,"Since more than 10 years we use FREUD LU89M014 noon ferrous for cutting copper bar, obtaining a good performance and a long life, so we are happy with this product."
1,One star for one awesome song: YDM,"THINK FUTURE! I can't understand why Matts Altar holds on to the ""traditional"" rock sound with this new CD. When there are so many possibilities with technology to break some experimental ground. The band members have the talent and creativity to break more than barriers! Young Dumb and Miserable has an almost((Industrial))sound quality to it. It would be interesting, if they did allow this single to be remixed over with a complete industrial sound to it...."
3,Not bad,"My first job with this saw blade was ripping 2"" maple. It worked hard but managed to cut through it. I don't believe it's recommended for such use. As a blade for smaller stock, it's more than adequate."
1,Does not stand up to a 'moderate' chewer,"My 6 month old cockapoo is more or less a moderate chewer. She has two other plastic toys from Nylabone's Moderate Chewer line: the corn cob from the Bar-B-Chew series and a Flexi-Chew bone. Both were introduced into the household over a month ago when her adult teeth came in and both have yet to show any wear. I introduced the Bar-B-Chew Rib yesterday afternoon along with the Bar-B-Chew Steak (for powerful chewers) and a few other toys. This morning I found that she had managed to break one of the 'bone' tips off the the ribs. I was afraid that she had ingested it but later found the missing piece deposited in another room.I'm very disappointed in this product. When I buy a Nylabone product, I expect it to last longer than 24-hours."
1,Very Dissatisfied!,"I consider my dog a moderate chewer, and she chewed the white part off in ten mins. I was sitting right beside her and noticed she was chewing on something that was not the chew! I looked at the chew and she had already swallowed an ""adult human molar"" size amount and was about to swallow another one! Shes only 5 months old, she is getting in her adult teeth, so I thought this would soothe her gums. She has the Cob Nylabone and has barely put a dent in it. I would not recommend this product!"
3,Well played but poorly recorded...,"Mr. Fulkerson gives an overall good performance of the Bach pieces...two problems, however...first,it sounds as though it was recorded in a large empty hall...the pervasive echo grates on one's nerves after a while and greatly distracts from the performance...second, what is his hurry?!...does he want to outrace Heifetz's performances?...if you have a short attention span you might like the blinding speed at which he attacks many of these pieces...on the other hand, Szeryng's recording is phonically better and the pace is ever so much more pleasant."
2,availble on DVD -- don't overpay for used VHS,"I see people selling used VHS copies here for close to $80. Why?Extra Terrestrial Visitors is available, new, on DVD. Amazon ASIN: B00078809SI first saw this film on TV as The Unearthling. Like most bad, low budget films, it's had several titles.Despite being bad, Extra Terrestrial Visitors has a weirdness quality. Part Alien, part E.T. One alien goes on a killer rampage while his/her child alien is adopted by a human, and we're supposed to think it's all cute & cuddly.Really weird, of the ""so bad it's good"" variety."
3,Tip Came Off,This company is an excellent company to work with. The tip for the stylus/pen came off and the stylus got stuck. We had to use tweezers to get it out. It could have been that mine was just bad.
5,stylus for xv6700,"I've ordered other stylus' before for my xv6700, they were wrong! This is the proper stylus. Thank you so much! Great service too!"
5,Love the Stylus,These stylus's are perfect for the Audiovox 6700 - I have used them (and lost) (and bought new ones!) several times. Forget my own head if it wasn't fastened on...
3,Letter from Death Row,"If you are a fan of Brett Michaels then you will like the album. My wife loves it. It was a gift for her. It is not my fav, but I never cared for Brett Michaels."
4,DEATHLY PRODUCED CD - By a Poison member,"Wow, cool great CD soundtrack to the suspenseful thriller film. 'A Letter from Death Row'. All the songs on this CD just makes the movie so much more interesting.There is so much energy that goes into each song. Each one is written well and was powerfully inspired by the film, staring Bret Michales.All you Poison fans go out there and get yourself a copy of the soundtrack as well, the movie (what a great package).Well, what can I say - just buy it and you will know how good it is."
1,As bad as the movie,"Michaels rightly couldn't get anyone to distribute his poorly conceived, written and acted golden turkey of a movie, so he was reduced to sell it on his own website. For those thinking that the soundtrack would be the ""silver lining"" of this dark storm forget it. It's mundane and trite...just like Bret!"
3,this will tide u over until new POISON cd,"the first couple of listens, i was a little disappointed..but it gets much better after repeated listenings. the production quality isn't all there, but it has heart..and bret michaels is a hell of a songwriter..his lyrics are often funny, poignant, touching, etc. i guess my faves on here are 'human zoo' and 'times like these', both of which would please any Poison fan. i actually give this record 3 & 1/2 stars. i love poison, but still look forward to bret's solo career. see ya!"
1,Michaels Death Row,"I love Poison but this album is terrible with the exception of maybe 2-3 songs. I was very disappointed after listening to it. The lyrics are cheesy and the tunes are not catchy. I do not know what the other poison fans see in this album. If you really want to hear this album, borrow your friends and dub it."
4,Gorgeous Illustrations,"I discovered this book on a trip to the crystal fields in Arkansas when I encountered a retired chiropractor who recommended it. It was great serendipity for me. It was just what I needed at the time.This is a short, thin book, but packs a whallop. The illustrations of angels channeled by the author are simply delicious. As a painter myself, I can appreciate the delicacy and sincerity of these works. In short, she captures each angel's essence in a beauty way. The invocations for each angel resonate with authenticity. I cannot say that of most channeled works, but I can definitely say that of this one.Lois J Wetzel, MFAAuthor""Akashic Records: Case Studies of Past Lives"""
3,Review: The Expansion of Everyday Life,"A great book for students studying the Civil War (like myself). Gives amazing insight to the lives of people during the Reconstrucion era after the war. Pages of great information about soldiers' lives, homes, churches, schools, rites of passage, working life, daily woes, and enjoying life in the late 19th century. However, the info somewhat dry, and gets a little tedious at times, but the amount of details and great facts evens it out a bit."
5,Expansion of Everyday Life - Expansion of Knowledge,"I found this book to be extremely information about life in the 1860s as I am into Civil War Re-enacting. There were so many interesting facts of everyday life, etc. that it was as if I had been transported back nearly 150 years."
5,Do what he says and what he does,"I am continually impressed by Wade Cook, the values he esposes and practices. In Business Buy The Bible, you will learn perhaps why Wade has been so blessed. Notice that he is one of the only seminar leaders that does not have seminars on Sundays?Why? Respect the sabbath.By the way, WADE IS BACK. To appreciate what he is doing check out his website at www.wadecook.org. If you buy this book, throw away the postcard inside and DO NOT call the toll free number inside the book. It's for another company that obviously does NOT have the same values as Wade. Go to wadecook.org for the new toll free number."
4,Do you believe?,"If you believe in God and the Bible and are in business at all...this is a book for you. Full of Scriptures, this book really gets you thinking."
1,check out his name for reviews,"I just purchased his book..because to me if someone quotes from the bible..I like to hear what he has to say..From the few pages I just read he does sound sincere...So I purchased his book..I should have known for 1.98 somethings up...After my purchase I decided to look up reviews about the author...In doing so I find out,,he's made a ton of money off other people..he's being sued..he went bankrupt (in his book he claims he's always made money)(in his book,,he says he want to help people)..In reading the few pages from his book..and in reading his reviews..I cant believe it's the same person...Is he trying to make a few more dollars off of the bible?? When I receive his book I will through it in the garbage,,because someone that lies,,and quotes from the bible is just a ******* **** ******"
3,,"This is heavy metal that's pretty laid-back and ear-friendly. At times it can be very majestic, which is when this Spanish band shines even more, and at other times the material sounds very straightforward, which makes it predictable. The verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure is applied firmly on most songs, but Dark Moor does it with such nobility. Mandatory ballads like ""Green eyes"" do not sound forced or romantic, which is a plus unlike many metal bands out there experimenting with their softer sides. Romero's singing accentuates the music very nicely. It doesn't require him to scream or hit long-range notes; it simply gets the job done according to what the music calls for. Tracks like ""The silver key"" and the title track itself are very traditional, and the use of keyboards here and there add color to the music. This is recommended listening for those relaxing Sunday afternoons, but also expect top-notch musicianship."
2,Doesn't stay on well,"Although I think this robe is incredibly cute, my dog refuses to keep it on. She normally doesn't mind wearing clothes, but the tie around the waist makes it easy for her to get her legs out of the sleeves. Also, I wouldn't use it to dry off the dog. I dry mine off with a towel and then put her in the robe to keep her from getting cold."
3,Cute Bathrobe,REALLY CUTE! Helps to keep your Pet warm and absorbs some water before towel & blow drying.
2,The Vinyl Picture disc,"On this record (not CD) we have a cute product by the Cute Beatle. Unfortunately, the pressing on the song ""Ever Present Past"" reminds us of the inconsistancies of the vinyl era when we could lick our collective chops waiting for our favorite artist's latest release, only to finally get it in our hot little hands, plop it on to our turntable (record player, for those who remember) and fire it up....when all of a sudden we hear the song weaving in and out of tune! Upon looking down at the needle, we see it going back and forth, toward and away from the center where the record fits over the spindle.Both copies of McCartney's vinyl single, ""Dance Tonight"", do JUST THAT. Bummer. I guess I'll just have to enjoy looking at it, knowing I have it, but NOT playing it unless I decide I want to get the sensation of hearing it DRUNK!But hang on tight if you can catch the VIDEO on YouTube. It's HOT!!!"
2,Book contains serious misinformation on taxes,"""Don't Die Broke,"" contains gross errors on pp. 244-245. The author claims that an estate of $1 million is subject to $550,000 in federal estate tax (error #1) and that heirs are subject to income tax on the balance of $450,000 (error #2). These errors follow an ""analysis"" that suggests that an estate of $1 million could be subject to estate and income taxes that total $946,000. This nonsense that leads me to doubt any information in this book and question the quality of editing at the Bloomberg Press. Even if these figures refer to an estate in excess of the unified credit (which is not at all evident from the context), the author states incorrectly that an inheritance is subject to income tax (see IRS pub. 525, ""Taxable and Nontable Income, p. 21)."
1,Expectations not meet; sub-title is deceiving; disappointed,"I was expecting a much more complete discussion on how to manage retirement funds especially guidelines for taking distributions from various types of retirement instruments. Only one chapter of the whole book really treated this issue. The primary pracital advice I got out of it is ""use taxable assets before deferred assets"".Most of the book (not devoted to filler pages) described the various kinds of retirement accounts. This was presented well and is informative. But given all the definitions and account alternatives, I did not get much in the way of useful advice on ""How to turn your retirement savings into lasting income""."
1,Don't believe the subtitle,"The subtitle is ""Taking Money out of your IRA, 401(k), or other savings plan-- and creating lasting retirement income, but there's precious little useful how-to here. There's basically one chapter (9) that deals with the details of setting up a withdrawal plan and the advice boils down to ""go find an investment advisor"". Most of the book is spent explaining 401ks, IRAs, workplace plans, etc.It's my own fault, though. Next time I'll read the TOC before buying!"
3,A Solid Effort!,"Many rules and regulations govern pension plans. The technicalities are complicated and change constantly. People can make irrevocable errors doing something as simple as moving assets from one plan to another. Margaret A. Malaspina cuts through retirement plan red tape and explains the jargon. She shows you how to get to your money after you have worked hard to save it. This book demystifies your options and clarifies the consequences of your choices. The author makes reading about taxes relatively painless. We at getAbstract recommend this book to anyone planning retirement, switching retirement plans, or withdrawing retirement funds. However, because of its discussion of United States tax law, it is not useful to those in other countries."
3,"Decent sound, quite comfortable, poor range","These headphones fit well, and have decent sound. On the down side the 100-foot range is wishful thinking, at least indoors. I bought these headphones for use our treadmill. Unfortunately, the treadmill motor interfered with the headphones unless the transmitter was placed directly next to the treadmill, headphone volume was set low and T.V. volume was moderate. This worked out well in my house. I ran a headphone extension cord from Radio Shack from the T.V. to a table next to the treadmill and got good sound. If your T.V. doesn't have a headphone jack like mine this is a great improvement. If you are looking for a set of wireless headphones for use near the audio source, and don't need mind blowing sound, these headphones are well worth forty dollars."
2,use with a treadmill,"My unit is several years old. I use an Emerson EHP1000 head set to listen to my TV while walking on my treadmill. When I first start walking, I get a lot of static. After about 10 minutes the static is reduced somewhat. If I put my left hand over the left bubble, the static is reduced by about 95%. I have tried my right hand over the right bubble and it does not help. I have tried my right hand over the left bubble and it does not help. Would buying a new headset resolve my problem? When I turn off my treadmill, the static is eliminated, but then, it is almost eliminated when I put my left hand over the left bubble, while it is running.I hope someone can give me some help so I can walk on my treadmill and listen to my TV. If anyone out there uses a headset while walking on a treadmill and does not get static, I would like to know the name and model of the headset."
4,Not up to the original,"Although a good game there are too many issues to call it great. It is not better than the first game which was a disappointment to me.Pros:Good Story, New items, maps, lightsaber's now have 6 slots to upgrade, item creation and breakdown, 9 additional characters, story tie in to the first gameCons:Long load times, glitches, freezes, poor end to the story, lack of character involvement even with 9 characters, too much errand running (more than the first)I liked this game and I am not sorry I own it but the first is still the one to own."
1,WTF is this price about,"Okay what the heck is up with the price of this game? $145 why is this game being sold for this price? Is this a type-o. There is no way this game, even as a collectors edition is worth this much. I own this game paid $20.00 for it brand new when it came out. And seriously I didn't believe it when my friend told me it was being sold on amazon for 145. It has great replay value, but no game is worth $145. I bought the collectors edition of The Old Republic and it didn't cost me over $80. So what makes this one worth $145? Someone please tell me why this is."
3,Could have been better,"I like the graphics, the sound and the worlds you visit in this game. I like that their are different light sabers and crystals that go into them. The Force is always frn. The characters are a point of interest. They have depth and each has their own weapons. I don't like that there is not much chance to explore what you want. The maps are little more than big interlocking squares in most places with monsters scattered around. The fighting is boring and the bad guys are repetative. The small details I like aren't able to carry the whole game. Overall, I got pretty board after a few worlds and have not played in since."
4,"A good sequel, as far as sequels go","I'll make this quick. This game is worth buying used for $20 for the nostalgia factor, (or if you have an original first gen Xbox, because it runs VERY choppy on 360) but definitely not worth paying $120 for a brand new copy. While KOTOR II has similar game play and familiar battle systems to its predecessor, the storyline and characters are just kind of weak in comparison. The first KOTOR was a masterpiece in my opinion. I base many RPGs that I play today on KOTOR and the feelings I got back when I first played it. Again KOTOR II is not a BAD game in any sense of the word. It just isn't quite up there with the first of it's kind. Id suggest going and purchasing The Old Republic for PC or MAC and enjoy everything the KOTOR games offer with much much more."
3,Dissapointed :-(,"Just to let the viewers know, I have a ""Xbox"". After playing the first KOTOR. Which was excellent. I was expecting this one to be the same or even better. They did not finish takening out the bugs and finishing with the final touch ups. It keeps locking up when you use the Workbenches ( for upgrades) on the planet Peragus. Also it would skip certain movies. So I finally took mine back to the store and exchanged with a newer/updated one. It still had problems, but enough that I could finish the story. You can see they were too much in a hurry to have it released on time (very big mistake). FYI: Next time if it is not ready for release then wait til it is. You really disappointed many Star Wars Fans. I have been a fan since the 70's."
4,kotor 2,"great game with horrible load times but once u get past this is a lot of fun, not much different from the first one but has a few added elements, its just as fun as the first one except weve already seen it all"
3,Interesting Story Interupted by Design Flaws,"The game was very fun and engaging. The battle systems are more hands on than other RPG games and can be changed quickly. I did find that I relied on only 2 or 3 attacks 99% of the time though which got a bit repetitive. Also, I found it hard to find the best equipment and really needed a cheat sheet with the armor and weapons listed in detail. The story is very good and the relationship with the characters was good too. However, I wasted about 5 hours of my time repeating events when the game would freeze on a black screen after a cut sceen or just lock up after I switch characters during a fight. I did a Internet search and found lots of others with the same problems; so, I am sure it's the game and not my machine. Anyways, make sure to save a lot and you'll be fine..."
1,Great game untill you realize what could have been,"Bottom line is that this game could have lived up to its predicessor, and that is saying a lot. Sadly, The publisher (lucusarts) pushed this game out the door in a sad attempt at making a few pennies before the game was finished.Much content was cut from this game (the missing files have been found in the PC versions directories) and it was put togather with chewing gum and duct tape as a result. The ending makes no sense at all, and some of the vital portions of the story had to be cut.Do not buy this game untill a content patch is allowed or a bonus disk is given out to make this game whole."
5,A fantastic RPG!,"I had a glitchy copy below, traded it in for a another that works perfectly and now I'm playing the best RPG ever...a masterpiece!!!"
1,My God!,"FOr the love of god, this game blows! I heard this KOTOR 2 game was the best. I hated it! These guys are telling me ""you need to flush out a near-by console without have slice throught destonon hydroxolyant. After that, reach the Fanta Base at ground level 16 grey, you must activate the sylington elevator and pick the Anti-screw hand held device"" What the crap!?!? I needed the game too make more sense! It's like trying to understand a Thailandic person who's having a seizure! THis game is crap! I returned it. THe gameplay is sad too. All you do is see your little character standing there, shooting his crappy laser and missing every fricking time! ITs like watching Ray Charles hit a retarded boy with a bat! KOTOR gets a 1/5. Game of the year my ass..."
1,lame,"This game has too many glitches to be considered a quality game. The first one was much, much better. Save your money."
4,Knights rides again,"I experienced some problems with choppy frame rates but overall I enjoyed this game as much as the first. Loved the addition of the prestige classes (although if you've played other Bioware titles this should come as no surprise) but I would have preferred to be able to go to more planets.Overall, it was a great game although I found the ending abrupt with a minor plot inconsistency. The new lightsaber ungrades and colours were also a nice addition If you liked the first and love the Star Wars universe you'll like this game as well, the playable demo of republic commando should get your mouth watering also."
3,Excellente! But with one problem...,"This is an excellent game and the gameplay is great. New force powers and abilities are awesome. I would have given this game one hundred stars if there was not a serious problem. A word of advice: if you buy a game used, buy it on a friday or saturday so you can play it non-stop to see if there are any problems. I got mine and it worked fine...until about the time I got my lightsaber. From about the time I left Peragus (a level in the game which is very early on) to about the time I got halfway through Nar Shadda (my first choice in planet selection) and it would freeze up entirley. I could not even get to the start menu it froze up so much. Plus with all the loading times, it would literally freeze probably every five minutes, but if you buy it new, it should be fine. So don't listen to me...except about the excellent part."
3,Doesn't measure up to KOTOR 1,"I did enjoy playing this game, but I found it to not nearly be as fun as KOTOR 1.The story was less compelling, and while the new force powers and ability to affect your comerades' alignment is nice, the game just felt more hollow as a whole.My biggest gripe is that the ending was a SEVERE disappointment. After all the time you put into the game, don't you deserve a little more (Like, say, in KOTOR 1?)"
5,Star Wars knights of the old republic 2 the sith lords,"This is one game that actually is much better than the original. The game starts off 5 years after the 2003 game of the year.There are numerous new features in the game but the best is the amount of force powers, there are 30 more force powers than in the first game. You start the game off as a Jedi and the sith are hunting you down thinking that you are the last remaining Jedi of the order. The game spans over a massive seven worlds that are much larger than the worlds previously. However the game itself is one of the greatest games I have had the pleasure of playing if you don't like this game you don't belong anywhere near an Xbox."
4,star wars knights of the old republic II,"What I wanted of the product first to be in a good condition to be play with out any problems, product came in great condition and right know I am enjoy playing with friends."
3,Interesting and Melancholic Story,"The player starts out as a Jedi knight who can not remember much of his or her past. It is not as great as its predecessor, but still a very fun role playing game. The characters are a little smaller in this game. There are more and also new enemies to fight besides the Sith. Battle takes place with a system of rounds and character statistics as was with the first game. There are many new and peculiar things compared with the first one such as styles of lightsaber fighting to suit different situations. It has a few bugs. Saving the game in different slots is safer than overwriting saved games."
2,Game Has Huge Freeze Problems,"Beware if you purchase this game - myself, along with numerous others, have had problems with the game freezing up without warning at various times. All you have to do is go to a search engine, type in ""KOTOR II"" and ""freeze"" and about 20 sites will appear referencing complaints.Also, for anyone that played the first version of this game, this is basically the same thing with a new story. Very little has been added to the actual gameplay, although over the course of 3 years you'd expect more improvement. Overall its a below average effort."
2,GREAT GAME RUINED BY BUGS,"The original KOTOR is my fav. game of all time, but I bought Halo 2 and KOTOR 2 and Halo 2 is blowing KOTOR 2 out of the water (but it wouldn't if there wasn't so many bugs and I could actually enjoy the game). THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BUGS AND GLITCHES. I CAN'T EVEN GET PAST A VITAL POINT IN THE GAME. BUY THIS AND PRAY THAT YOUR COPY ISN'T BUGGY."
2,Kotor 2 -- Unfinished,"Wow, a great game! This game is easily 5 stars worth of fun and gameplay, but the ending...:LA [LucasArts] did not give Obsidian enough time to develop the game. It was a Christmas-rush job, you can totally tell. I loved the game, but it's liek you are playing for nothing. How could you do that to a long-awaited sequel?!?!? I loved kotor 1, great ending(s), but the whole 6 SECONDS of Kotor 2's ending blew. BioWare or Obsidian can do Kotor 3, they are both great, good job guys, unless you have barely a year to do the game!EDIT: This game is very glitchy too, due to the lack of time. May wanna think first before you buy it, unless you wanna screw up your XBox, which has happened to people..."
3,"Loved the game, HATED the ending.","I won't spoil the ending for you, but it feels like the writers weren't done, and some boss said, just make some crap up and finish it in the next 15 minutes. Awesome game, awesome gameplay, crappy crappy ending. Also, it goes back and ruins the previously somewhat happy ending you had if you played the light side in the first game. I have never felt so betrayed by a game. I was so excited to get it, and so in love with the whole gameplay, plot, everything... then the ending destroyed it. I hope that the sequel (if any) can repair the damage, because I just heard thousands of angry voices cry out, then suddenly get silenced.Surprisingly, I just played a game with a worse ending: Dreamfall, the longest journey. My review on that is another story."
2,This game is sub-quality...,"This game is so full of bugs it's ridiculous. The first time through the game I encountered a few lock ups, the more I tried to unlock in the game the more I locked up. I really enjoyed the first game, and had high hopes for this one, but between no story line and all the lock ups I don't think Obsidian Entertainment even has a quality assurance program. This game is a sad failure compared to the original."
3,Man this game rules!!,Let me start off by saying that this game was much harder than the first one.All i liked about this game was the part where you get to do the lightsaber and fight all the sithlords.
3,"More of the same plus More bugs, More loading time","Continues the fun from the first game -- except the new story is like a pale copy of the first KOTOR, the loading times are actually worse (I eat during loading times) and the bugs are horrible. My XBox has crashed at least twice a day. They don't even have an XBOX Live component to download patches or new material.KOTOR I was an incredibly great game. KOTOR II is an okay, sloppy game. (Guess they had to rush it out for Christmas shopping season)."
1,Dull,Don't get this game. it is confusing and hard to play. also how did almost all of the party members die?
3,first one was better,"The first KOTOR was better than this 2 one. It was storyline than there was fighting & all. I mean the first one was more detail in fighting,disguising yourself so you can get thru security & less talking but in this one,when you talk it seems like forever till you can actually go fight or even visit a planet. I mean I enjoyed it & the graphics was bettter than the first but the first was better abovwe all else. IN this one you are already a jedi but yhave to pick a class to be in & color lightsaber n all other crap. Still have the same hold 2 weapons n everything else like the first but lacks other stuff that the first episode had. *I would expect star wars fans to think bout getting this 2nd KOTOR 2 before buying it."
2,"I buy Everything through Amazon,even souless games.","After many years of playingRPGs, I find that The Sith Lords, did not create an intimate concern or connection with me(the player).While the battles were very Jedi, there was nothing of concern to fight for. If you are a true RPGer buy this game only if you're jonesing for a lightsaber spar fest. It lacks a soul. No Cheers, No Tears."
3,Nothing stands out,"This game isn't terrible, but then it doesn't really stand out either. The first game was amazing with a killer story, but the sequel doesn't offer anything remotely comparable. The story is weak and half the time I found myself not even following the plot and it didn't bother me. The ending just plain sucked. The dialog trees offer more choices when deciding on how to reply to npcs, but I never really felt like I had total control of my destiny like in the first game. In the first game I played through twice just to get the light and darkside experiences. And it was awesome each time. I couldn't handle playing this game twice, no way. One other thing that I simply have to comment on...the fetch quests. I can understand one or two per world but it seems like this is all you do in this game... how dissappointing. If you liked the first one than by all means play this one. Just be forewarned you're getting a watered down version with no imagination."
3,Uninspired story line,"I loved the first version of the game -- an engaging story with fascinating characters and plot twists. The sequel, rather than taking the franchise to new heights, slips into linear and flat stories, and tons of exposition.Some play enhancements are to be found, but they are overshadowed by story and tech problems.Any comparison to Republic I is going to be a tough act to follow. Unfortunately, Republic II moves the franchise in the wrong direction."
4,Pretty good overall,"This game is pretty good overall. It has good graphics and lots of features. There are also many good elements and the plot is very exciting. In some places it can be very challenging though. I don't recommend it if you dont have much time on your hands, it sucks you in and keeps you playing for hours. So you might not want to play if it is a week night or there is something important the next morning because if you play it will keep most people up all night. People have a very high level of attraction to this game due to the plot. It has not lived up to expectations though, most people agree that the original Knights of the Old Republic was better overall. Very fun but remember it is absorbing and people will get attracted and play for hours at a time."
4,Good Sequel,"KOTOR II is a good sequel. The gameplay didn't change that much since the first which I thought was ok. Overall I think it's a good game but not as good as Part 1. The Sith were too easy to beat, not just the last one (I don't remember her name) but all of them and it didn't take me long to figure out anything. I was expecting a plot twist like with Revan but that never happened. None of the characters held up like part 1 either, nothing special about them. I haven't played the ""Dark Side"" yet but I was dissapointed in the light side ending, way way to short, like they left it open for a sequel with your character. Anyways I still had fun with the game mostly because I love the Star Wars series. Hopefully they'll continue to make more of these games in the future."
3,Too many gltiches!!!!!!!!,The story is fine and everything else about the game tops the original but t's totally broken with far too many glitches and choppy frame rates and freezes etc. that totally ruin the epxerience. Obviously Obsidian released this game way way too soon before they had a chance to iron out the problems. Buy this game only if you don't mind losing 30 hours of your saved game due to a glitch or constant slow down or pop up or game freezes etc. Very Frustrating!!!!!!!!!
3,More of the same....,"While the first Knights of the Old republic kept me interested, this one seemed to fall short of my expectations. This game used almost the exact same formula as the previous. The same basic game mechanics are there, you run around and make decisions that guide you to either the Light or the Dark side of the force, and your team is influenced by your alignment. Different options are available based on these decisions and how you build your character up. It took almost half the game for the story line to peak to a point where I was able to keep my interest. I played as a Jedi throughout, and for me the ending was incredibly disappointing. The end villain was long-winded and boring in their final speech. While the ending leaves the series open to a third installment, I'm not sure I would really care if one was made after this one. If your a die hard Star Wars fan or a really big fan of the first KOTOR, then I would recommend you look into this one, otherwise I would say skip it."
3,it's better than most sequels.,"Of course, I had to purchase this due to loving the first one, but as usual, it does not have the same ""umph"" as the first one. RPG and Star Wars fans (the KOTOR 1 ones) should still play this. Rent it, or purchase it used or brand new for cheap. I thought it is a worthy to have in my x-box collection. It's not that bad. Yes, there are some of the same 'ol stuff, leaving things unchanged, but if you loved the first one, you will not have problems picking this up. The strongest point of it I bealive is the story. It made me want to keep going.My biggest complaint was that the battle with the Sith Lord featured on the cover was not that great. I mean he was sith-scary, but a push over fight."
4,KOTOR 2 is more than you think,"If you play this game do not just skip through the story and do all the main missions, every character has an extended story. Your influence gets them to tell you who they truely are. The game is much too short, there is almost no way you can do everything this game has to offer in the short time you have. The first KOTOR characters are dull they are exactly who you think they are and they help you only in battle. Kriea for example increases your max force points all the time, you just have to talk to her. Every character is like this. If you have this game and do not already know all this play it again and see for yourself how good this game really is."
5,kotor ii will rule,This will be one of the best Xbox rpgs ever right with kotor fable and all the rest.
5,When does it come out.,Different websites say that it comes out in December but this website says Febuary. It was anounced that it was goint to come out in Febuary but they are way ahead of schedual and now people(games sites) are saying before christmass. It has it at christmas for ebgames. Does anyone know what is going on.
5,best kept secret in LA.,"it's really hard to say what you want everybody to experience when someone like barry has been on the scene for so long and has just barely broke ground on a fan basis,i've seen this man play,and his performances are unbelievable from a fans point of view. when i watch him play,he turns into a virtouso that only a few people have seen before,his abilities are beyond perfection,his music is probabley the best that's out right now as far as a purest to the blues. his heart is true to his hand,he only plays what he knows and thats the blues,in the purest form! what he is able to bring to the table in his music is beyond belief,he will make you cry,he will make happy,and he will make you understand what the blues is about!he has the gratitude of many,many musicians that want to play with him,or have him produce. i will always remember barry levenson,for what he has done for the blues scene!!"
3,Theosophical Society and Bhagavadgita,"Bhagavadgita, the holy book of Hinduism has been studied and commentaries written upon by gurus, monks, academics, Christian scholars and by organizations such as ISKCON, Theosophical Society, Vedanta Society, etc. In this book the author gives theosophical society's point of view of Bhagavadgita. Considering the fact the theosophical society is interested in both theology and philosophy of Gita, the author's commentaries reflects this in spirit and tone; the author discusses how a man who perfects himself in devotion finds himself in the progress of time, and in the 5th chapter he discusses the fruit of renunciation. If you are serious about the philosophy of Bhagavadgita, there are several excellent books, but if are interested in theology and theosophical society's views of Bhagavadgita, this is your book."
4,False Advertising,"This ""IS NOT"" a 1/2"" shank router bit set. Please correct the product description. It is a 1/4"" shank set."
2,Wasn't very helpful,All the things the author talks about have been talked about in GOBS of other books and isn't an inciteful book for it's time. Wasn't worth the money.
1,"Hot, but smart book","from short, a great,full of science, life book.If you need it, buy it,If you don't, buy it you'll learn any way....oriol"
4,Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Electric Kettle,Great Product. It heats my water in an instant. You must have this product if you heat water for coffee or tea. I highly recommend it.
4,Great design -- both form and function,"So far so good. I use it every day and I love the convenience. It's a good weight, looks sharp, and most importantly, it boils water. I do wish it turned off as soon as the water came to boil, but it stays on for about 10 seconds -- and that's a very *minor* grievance.I like the flip top so you never have to touch a potentially hot lid. Not having exposed coils makes it very easy to clean.It has two anti-clutter features which I like -- one is that the cord wraps under the base so you only have as much cord exposed as you need -- and it's feet slide easily across the counter so storage against the counter wall after the steam has ceased is easy.Highly recommended."
4,Still going strong after 3 years Plus,I would buy this model again even though the interior is not seamless and does develop rust stains. It's huge and works fast.
1,STICKER LEAVES UN-REMOVABLE MARK!?!?!,"I purchased this kettle as it was predominately stainless steel. IT'S A BRILLIANT kettle! It works well, I have no problem with the way it pours, it boils at a decent speed, the small amount of plastic in the lid does not bother me - it's not that poisonous people!.. it looks great and the quality seems good. I REALLY would like to have given it 5 stars but unfortunately I believe the manufacturer shot themselves in the foot with such a pathetic reason. *THIS ITEM COMES WITH A STICKER AFFIXED TO THE SIDE OF THE KETTLE - THE KETTLE IS A BRUSHED STAINLESS STEEL FINISH. UPON REMOVING THIS STICKER ALL YOU ARE LEFT WITH IS A BIG ROUND MARK WHERE THE STICKER WAS - SAID MARK IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE & THEREFOR LEAVING THE KETTLE LOOKING LIKE CRAP. THIS IS SUCH A PATHETIC FLAW I HAD TO RETURN THE ITEM. WHAT A WASTE!"
2,broken within three months,"We got our kettle about 3 months ago after having our last plastic one for 3 years. We went with the metal kettle after reading about boiling in plastic being not so great for you. It was heaver and did not hold as much water. Worked well enough if you poured slowly, if not it ran down the front of the kettle. A metal piece just broke off between the kettle and the heater. Bummed it broke so soon. Will be replacing with another kind."
2,"Just the specs we wanted, but it leaks.","UPDATE 12/31/12: ""Leak"" is an understatement. This kettle POURS water from the bottom under the handle; we've tried all kinds of different tricks because we like the specs. Oh well, I'm giving up and returning it today.I'm hoping that it's user error, but the kettle leaks (a lot). I'll contact the seller to see what my options are. We used to have a cheap one, and while it wasn't as attractive, I didn't have the same safety concerns."
5,LOVE IT!,"This kettle works perfectly and is everything I wanted. The ""cool-touch"" is a great safety feature. While it is quite warm to touch, it is not hot enough to burn skin. The auto shut-off works effectively, which allows me to hit the start button in the morning and get on with my morning routine, without concern. I get back to it when I can and the double layer of metal keeps the water piping hot for several minutes. And as other reviews point out-it is very fast to boil, 4 minutes for a full pot (which at the maximum fill line is only 4 Cups-not 8). I got this to use with my french press coffee pot- HOT coffee for me and tea for my daughter."
3,Ok but,"The first one we received had a rust spot within the first week of using it. The replacement, which we are using now, arrived with a dent at the bottom inside the metal container. Too much trouble to send back for another replacement so we just keep using it."
4,Nice HOT water!,"So far, this has been a great electric kettle. The water is nice and HOT. I use it every night. The only thing I miss on this unit is the fill level. Not a deal breaker but it would be nice if it had some marks on the inside to know how many cups you are making. I think I undershot it a few times."
4,Good pot with minor flaws,"Good pot, but not as fast coming to a boil as the last pot I had, which I ruined by absent-mindedly putting it on the gas stove. It does the job, but the cover is so designed that if you make a full pot of water, the cover goes into the water, which means you need to be sure to keep it clean."
2,Not My Cup of Tea!,"I purchased this kettle because of the reviews that stated there was no plastic in contact with the water. I'm trying to eliminate BPA's from my diet! The part that holds the water is stainless and plastic free, however inside of the lid is totally plastic and subject to condensation which drips down into the kettle water. So, this is, more than likely, adding BPA's to the water. The lid is also a pain as far as I'm concerned, having to remove it and line up tabs every time it's replaced on the kettle. Water level is also difficult to see, so I'm not happy about that. I will keep this kettle because it's too much trouble to return, and it does offer less plastic contact with the water than most, but as soon as something better comes along, i.e. completely plastic free, it's out of here!"
1,Horrible.,"We've had this kettle for about 1.5 months. We discovered today that when there is water in the kettle, water leaks out the bottom of the kettle, in the area just below the on/off switch. Needless to say, we are returning the product because we don't want to be electrocuted.We've also had problems since day 1 with pouring water without having water leak all over the place - I think the spout is poorly designed and when you pour, water dribbles down the side of the kettle.It's really too bad because this is a nice looking kettle and it is stainless steel."
1,This kettle isn't worth a $1,You can't pour the boiling water out without it going everywhere. The spout doesn't function. Useless piece of CR** - very unhappy with it.
1,Leaks!,Leaks like hell! It seems leaks from both top and bottom! Don't buy it!!!! Complete waste of money:( a a
2,Base Unstable,While the unit functioned correctly and looked good the base is very unstable and easy to tip over a kettle full of boiling water. Returning item for one with much more solid base
1,New Math 64 oz. = 38 ozs... Capacity vs. Max,"I'm confused. The specs boast 64 oz. capacity. The directions strongly caution against filling beyond the MAX line, as steam and water will drip from the bottom of the kettle. The yield from the max line is 38 ozs... not enough to fill our 48 oz. French press coffee maker. So how can they call it an 8 cup capacity machine?Also, filling water to the top yielded 54 ozs, cold, in our measurement. I never was that good at math, but.... Wha? Help?"
1,Worked a grand total of two (2) times,I bought this because it's steel inside and out (prevents the plastic smell) and has a wide opening on top so it would get cleaned easier. The first time it boiled the water fast and the automatic shut off kicked in a few seconds after the water hit the boiling point. The second time the automatic shut off failed and when I tried a third time this sorry excuse for a product wouldn't even turn on! What a waste. It's a shame the quality is terrible because it's a good concept.
1,Lasted 9 months,"My primary requirement was that boiled water should not have an off-taste. This kettle was perfect in that regard. There were a few minor issues, though: (a) the two parts of the plastic handle divided somewhat, (b) I never seemed able to pour boiled water without some leaking down the side of the kettle on to the counter, & (c) the water seemed to boil quite a while before shutting off. Even so, I'd say I was happy with the unit until this morning. Maybe, in a perfect world, I would have only given the kettle 3.5 stars, but looking at the problems reported by users of different brands, maybe it deserves 4.5 stars.However, it died this morning, just one minute into boiling a full kettle. The green on-light remained on. I ordered the item on 8/29/09. Received it almost exactly 9 months ago. Hence the lowest rating."
4,Perfect if the spout didn't drip,"This is the second Hamilton Beach Cool-Touch kettle I've owned. The base to my last one quit working after about 5 years, and after shopping around and realizing that even most of the high-end stainless kettles were not insulated, I purchased another one of these. It heats water quickly, shuts off at boiling and holds the water at temp. The only flaw with it is that the spout is not pronounced enough, so it is really difficult to pour water without having it dribble down the side of the kettle onto the counter. However, it seems to be about the best choice available, if you don't want plastic coming in contact with your boiling water."
3,Works well but with flaws.,The water drops all over the place when pouring. My wife and I are in a perpetual hunt for the perfect electric kettle.
1,Worst kettle I have ever owned,This kettle gave me problems in less than 2 months and finally died. I had a very bad coil burnt smell in the water for nearly 2 months and now it stopped working completely. I dont understand why Hamilton Beach makes such useless consumer products.
3,Really god but not durable,"The product is great. Sleek, simple, convenient. But after about a year of usage I had to rotate the kettle on its base at an exact angle with the cord in order for the electrical contact to work. Now, after less than 3 years, the contact is not established at all. I'll have to buy another kettle, even though I was quite satisfied with the rest of the product."
1,Always a mess,"Yes it heats water quickly, but only 2 cups at a time and the water spreads over top when pouring! A waste of money and always a mess to clean. Not happy; read all reviews and none highlighted this point. Would not purchase again."
4,A little too big,"It's larger than appears in photos. The top is a little strange, i worry it's going to get water everywhere. But it looks really good."
3,"Great looks, bad usability","This kettle looks great, it does. But there's no way to quickly check water level, the base station is really unstable and pouring in water is inconvenient because of rotating lid design.Other than that it just works."
1,It broke in 6 months almost to the day.,"Other than the fact that the heating element or the plastic turn on flip switch broke within 6 months (I'm not sure which it was), it has been a somewhat good pot for heating water.The pour spout was leaky when the top was closed so I opened the top to pour the water in my cup. I liked the fact it is stainless steel and the heating element is contained, but I will buy another brand next time with those features.It is not worth the money when it only lasts 6 months."
3,really great.... until the bottom rusted.,"this seems to be one of very few electric kettles that is predominantly stainless (i.e. no plastic ""window"") though the lid is plastic and the very hot steam does interact with that during boiling process. but i was living with that, no complaints. use it 3-5 (or more) times a day sometimes, it generally has been fantastic UNTIL rust looking deposit is forming on the bottom of the inside of the kettle. it is not calcium deposit, it does not some off with scrubbing or vinegar or such methods. it's rust. isn't it stainless? i'm not sure what to do."
5,"funky lid, no water level indicator, does heat water as advertised","Well this is a good pot with it's own unique characteristics. First is the lid. It rotates from a closed position to a 90 degree angle. Doesn't sound bad, but in practice the lid is still in the way when you try to fill the pot. Keep the lid clean because the water you add is going to come in contact with that surface.Second, for a hot water pot, it is unusual to NOT have a water level indicator. Even if you never check it, you have no option here. That means opening the lid to check how much water is in it.It does boil water rather quickly and that is it's main function at my house. I have noticed that it doesn't hold as much water as other kettles we've had. So it gets refilled often. Then that lid comes into play again."
1,Terrible product design -- causes scalding and lid to fall out,"I tried this product because it was rated so highly by others on this site and was sorely disappointed. During normal operation of pouring hot water from the unit, the lid falls out and steaming hot water comes rushing out. I got scalded a couple of times. This is a terrible product and a lawsuit in the making for this company."
1,Not for kitchen use,"The kettle works fine but the lid is sunk below the edge of the kettle. The lid also flips to below the kettle edge line. This means that if anything is spilled on top of the kettle, when you try to clean the top, the crumbs fall into the kettle. The lid is not removable and the opening is not big enough (especially with the filter) to clean the inside. While I only used water in the kettle, our water is hard and I like to occasionally wash the inside of my kettle. It is not possible with this kettle. The description does not state that the lid can't be removed, nor that it can not be hand cleaned. This is not the kettle to use in a kitchen."
3,Leaks toward the back of the pot on the bottom where the boil lever is located,"I really wanted to like this kettle and in fact, we do like it, as the weather cools, I'm wanting more warm and hot drinks and this kettle boils so quickly, it's really great. Also, some of the bad reviews say that the kettle drips as you pour which I have not found to be the case. HOWEVER, last night, after hubby used the kettle and set it back onto the base, I noticed there's some water by the base and toward the back of the pot where the handle is and it looked like it was leaking where the ""press to boil"" lever/button is. I was like, no way, maybe he didn't wipe it dry from filling it up or whatever. So I called him over and upon closer inspection it looks like it really is dripping/leaking there. We're disappointed but we're going to give it one more try and ask to replace it, but if the next one is also a lemon, then I guess we'll just have to return for a refund. I wonder what's going on?"
1,Quit working in less than two years,"I am so sorry I bought this. I really liked it but it stopped working. For what I paid for it, it should still be functioning."
2,Top broke in 3 weeks,"We really liked this kettle for the first three weeks and then the top would not stay closed. I agree with reviewers that the max line is hard to read and that the top is an odd design but, when it worked, we thought it was great. I have to send it back to the manufacturer but, I am afraid that the same thing will happen again."
2,Nearly perfect but died very quickly,"If this kettle hadn't died so quickly, I'd strongly recommend it.Love the fact that it's all stainless steel so there's no plastic in contact with the water (research shows this is important for health reasons, due to leaching of toxins from plastic into water, especially at high temperatures).Also, the double vacuum walls of the kettle are a great feature that i wish were on every electric kettle, as they serve two valuable functions: keeping the water inside hotter for longer, while keeping the outside of the kettle cool to the touch.Unfortunately, the kettle suddenly stopped working (with no warning or obvious symptoms) after about 6 months of use over an 18-month period, which is unacceptable."
1,Did not last 6 months - useless,"Used this kettle for 5 months on a daily basis, never treated it rough - just boiled water 1-2 times per day. My expectation for any electric kettle is that it works for as long as I own it (I used my previous electric kettle for 12 years and I decided to buy this one as a change, not because the previous one was broken).Do not buy this product, go with another manufacturer - I am extremely disappointed."
5,So far so good,It has been only 5 days since I used it; it is better than I expected. First all stainless steell (only lid is plastic but it doesn't touch the hot water) and it is so fast .I hope it doesn't give me a problem for a long time ..Hamilton Beach 40898 Cool-Touch Cordless 8 Cup Electric Kettle
2,Good if you like scalding hot water...pouring on you,"I chose this item because of all the positive reviews, but I am very disappointed. Sure the design is awesome. It is 99.99% metal, which is great. It heats up well. But it also has the WORST spout I have ever seen. It is next to impossible to get a clean pour without wonderfully boiled water pouring ALL over the place...like on my FOOT!!This leads me to ask about all the glowing reviews. There are three explanations that I can come up with for the good reviews: 1. There is some magical way to get the boiling water not to pour all over the place, but since I did not go to Hogwarts, I do not know what it is; 2. The good reviews are from people who do not actually use it for anything that involves boiling water; 3. The people who wrote the reviews were paid to write them.I still give it 2 stars because the design is pretty awesome, if not functional."
2,One year limited warranty,Loved this product because there is no plastic that comes into contact with the water loved it until it stopped working one year and two months after purchase.
2,Plastic still touches the hot water!,"Does noboy notice that the underside of the lid is all plastic? Also, that black shadowing in the photo near the ""spout"" on top of the lid is not shadowing or light reflection. It's plastic! Worse yet, there is no way to pour out your water without it flowing along all that plastic at the spout unless you completly remove the lid before heating the water! I'm sending this back and asking for my shipping fees credited to me as well. This is a misrepresented product!"
1,Not for tea drinkers with a sensitive palette or nose,"I am a regular tea drinker and nearly burn the house down every couple of years when the whistle on my stove top tea kettle breaks and I boil the kettle dry. I decided after a great deal of research to try a stainless electric kettle and this one had the fewest reviews regarding odor or taste. It is fine for brewing a robust cup of tea; however, there is a distinct chemical flavor that comes through with lighter teas such as a green/black tea mix that I have as a second cuppa.I'm not sure what to do or what product to try next, but I am quite disappointed. Additionally, as it comes to a full roiling boil, it is very loud. Rather like a dull roar."
3,works well but drips,"We've had this kettle for a couple years now and it's still going strong. The only thing is that the water drips down the front as you pour... leaving a little puddle on the counter right under the base. At first it was just a few drops but now they're getting larger. If you pour more than one cup, you'll need another cup to capture the drips.Another thing is that the lid swivels at the middle which causes the back of the lid to dip inward into the kettle. If you try to fill it up too much, the lid will touch the water. You'll need to clean it often if you don't want anything on the lid to touch the water."
4,Not exactly 'Cool-Touch' and spout dribbles but still pretty good and almost completely plastic-free,"Pros:- Boils quickly- Looks nice- Easy to clean, the entire top lid easily removable- No plastic parts touch the water while heating up- No exposed heating element- Leaves no taste in waterCons:- Spout is wide and dribbly, must be careful when you pour- Not exactly what I would call ""Cool-Touch"" but more like ""slightly warm touch""- Plastic on lid and spout filterPros far outnumber the cons. The reason I got this was because I wanted a plastic-free electric kettle. Plastic parts do not touch the water while boiling, but they will when you pour it out. You can avoid this by removing the top lid when you pour the water out, which is really easy to do."
2,Not a great product,"Given the price I expected somethign better. But let's start with what's good:Pro:- All stainless steel inside, no heating coil or plastic- Acceptable volumeCons:- Spout leaks towards the base while pouring water out of the kettle. Unbelievable! A major design flaw.- Can hardly see the MAX line when filling up with water- Switch stays in the ""on"" position when kettle removed from the base.The cons may not be that many but just the fact that the spout is leaking water along the kettle to the base should be an issue that prohibits further production of ths kettle.I would not recommend to buy it but the problem is that the US market has not many alternatives for kettles without plastic, heating coil and fill gage (which is also always a major issue with almost any kettle)."
2,Misleading measurement,"64 US fluid ounces = 1.89270589 liters, unless you're Hamilton Beach.Everything in the literature on this kettle states 8 cups. And 8 cups = 64 oz (which is precisely the measurement used in the description on Amazon). But the kettle holds no more than 1.2 liters (and states as much on the box).I am very disappointed. I purchased this to replace a 1.7 liter Breville, based on its reviews. Were I to do this over, I'd buy the Breville again.It does a fine job of boiling water, as long as you don't want more than 1.2 liters."
2,Smells just like a band-aid,"One of the main reasons I bought this kettle was due to the stainless steel interior. Boiling water in a plastic kettle never seemed like such a great idea. This one looked pretty good and several people commented that there was no plastic smell. Sadly, I was not so fortunate. I don't know if my nose is more sensitive than most or if they changed factories in China, but my kettle has that plastic 'band-aid' smell to it when it boils. I've determined that the smell comes from where the handle attaches to the kettle. On the inside of the kettle there's exposed plastic which gives off this nasty smell. I've tried putting lemon juice on it, white vinegar, etc. Nothing's helped. I've boiled maybe 20-30 kettles of water and it still stinks, although slightly less. I'm hopeful it will completely fade soon, but wow. What a disappointment."
1,water coming out of the bottom after two uses,"I spent hours looking over reviews in order to replace my old (cheap) electric kettle. I decided on this one based on price and ratings. However, after just two uses, water is leaking out of the bottom little holes of the kettle. I would definitely not recommend this kettle."
3,Spout leaks,"I spent ages looking for a good electric tea kettle and read all the reviews on a number of sites. The Hamilton Beach Cool Touch looks good and works well, that is until you pour the hot water into a mug and then it leaks along the spout onto the counter. We've still been using it, but will be buying a new kettle soon."
1,"horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE!!","From the onset, this has always dribbled a bit while pouring which I have considered a minor nuisance until now when I burnt my leg while filling my mug. I would like to chuck this into the rubbish but need to keep it until I find a suitable replacement. I do not recommend this product unless you enjoy hot water burns."
3,the good and the bad,"I've had this teapot for 3 months now - I was very happy with the insulated sides and general ease of use. However, while most of the teapot seems incredibly sturdy and well made, there are two tiny little plastic nibs that move in and out to allow you to open and close the lid of the pot. While seemingly tiny and insignificant, the teapot becomes much less useful when the little nibs get stuck inside the walls of the pot. The lid will no longer stay closed, and the teapot will no longer shut off on its own when it's finished boiling - never mind that there is steam and heat escaping all over the place.I've found that I can use my fingernail to flick down and get them to pop out again, but it's been a few days of this and I'm tired of it. With such a well made product, why would they include such a flimsy lid closure? Fix that and the pot gets 5 stars."
2,"Not 8 cups, more like under 6","The container may actually hold 8 cups BUT and it is a big BUT the interior metal has a MAX line at the just under 6 cup level. So if you think you are able to boil one full quart with this one, don't buy it. I'm disappointed."
2,not good enough for the price,"""Cool Touch"" is nothing cool about. It still get really really hot if you have max amount of water boiling. (maybe around the bottom part, you could touch and keep your hands on, but definitely not around top! Couldn't even keep my hands on for a second! I couldn't use this because i have a small child with hands busy like a raccoon. He'll burn his hands sooner or later.(for the kettle stays hot for a while..)Spout is really poorly designed, water seeps out too wide if I tip it too fast/too low for the water amount.The way the lid opens makes it hard for me to pour water in to fill. I wonder if other people take the lid off every time...It is a beautiful kettle, but not good enough for me to keep."
3,All the Department know when I make tea!,"I am happy of that, it works fine, and the price was not that high. The only thing I wish I could fix is that it makes a lot of noise when starts working, and everyone know when I make tea!"
4,"good style, functional","i like the style, takes up little space on my countertops. the cool touch is a great feature. only 4 stars due to occasional whistling and can be very messy if poured too quickly. i'm usually in a hurry and end up getting water everywhere, but the problem is avoidable."
1,Do not buy,"This kettle worked for less than one month. When I returned it, I was charged ten dollars ""re-stocking"" I would not buy a thing from these people."
5,exactly what i have been looking for,"Forget the stovetop kettle - this is the way to go.We are very happy with this purchase.- water boils quickly- kettle is insulated- kettle is stainless inside and out- there is some plastic on the lid, but there is minimal contact with the plastic when pouring. You could pour without touching the plastic if it bothers you that much.- auto shut off- no drips- wide mouth means no need for a water level indicator. Simply flip the lid and look inside.- simple, sleek design means it does not clutter the counter top."
5,Great kettle for daily use,"I got this for the kitchen in my office and everyone loves it. It is heating a lot of water every day and doing great. Boils really fast, especially if not completely filled and/or with water still warm from a previous run. Very comfortable handle, and easy to pour. The only criticism I've had is the the built-in filter that you pour through seems pretty pointless -- but it doesn't get in the way or hurt the experience of using it at all. We just use pre-filtered water in the kettle anyway.Highly recommended!"
5,Well engineered product,"I wanted to order a stainless steel electric kettle that didn't have any plastic touching the water, and this product fits the bill. On top of that, it is very fast to boil, stylish and well engineered. The only room for improvement would be a ""bell"" when the water has boiled."
2,Spills when pouring,"I liked the design of this kettle and it does boil quickly, however, it leaks almost every time I pour water from the kettle. This is a major flaw, as it means that I need to wipe the counter each time I pour, but it also unsafe as the hot water that spills can also flow off the counter and cause burns."
2,Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle,Inserting and using the lid is not user friendly. Our water is soft and a coating appeared on inside of kettle and was almost impossible to remove. Loud noise and vibrations are heard as the water comes to a boil. The automatic shutoff takes too long to function.
5,Classy looking piece,I've been using this for about a week now and I just love it. Using water out of the tap leaves a horrible looking film and water spots on the inside. I've been using purified water and it stays clean if water remains in there for any period of time and it boils really quickly. The lid is a little tricky to get on but nothing I would complain about. This is definitely a plus for sure and I'm loving mine.
4,Would be perfect if it didn't dribble,"I was trying to avoid plastic when heating water, and this kettle fits the bill. I only have two complaints: it puts out more steam when heating than my plastic kettle, so I have to move it out from under my wooden cabinets and it dribbles most of the time when you pour the hot water into a cup or other container. I also miss knowing how much water is inside, but giving up the plastic window was worth it until they figure out another indicator."
4,Great Kettle,"We bought this kettle perhaps three years ago to replace our previous plastic-lined kettle. We were a little surprised about the actual fillable volume, thus the 4 stars. As long as you do not fill much past the max of 40 ounces, it works like a charm, bringing water to a boil very quickly and quietly.Make sure you let the kettle come off the boil before pouring out or else the kettle will leak out the bottom. If you overfill the kettle, it will leak out the bottom as well. I cannot imagine that this is good for the insides of the kettle.I would definitely recommend this kettle."
2,DRIPS....ALWAYS,This kettle boils well but drips whether the lid is closed or open for pouring. It drives me nuts. I'm sorry I bought it.
1,NOT SAFE. AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF ONLY WORKS IF LID IS SHUT.,"We have an elder in the house who set of the fire alarms with this kettle last night. If that's your issue, DON'T GET IT. It is too easy to set it to boil with the lid popped open. Also, ALWAYS pours funny and drips on my pets at my feet. Low capacity."
2,Not 8 cups,Kettle description says it holds 8 cups. When filled with 8 cups this kettle leaks out of an overflow hole at the top of the handle then it flows down to weep holes in the base. Max fill line is at around 5 cups. It probably won't leak if only filled to max line. Unfortunately I need more capacity.
2,"Nice looks, completely dysfunctional","This kettle has one nice feature in its completely stainless steel design with cool touch - the outside does not get as hot as the liquid inside. Apart from that it is hopeless in actual use. Filling it is not easy: there's no spout really so you open the lid; the flip lid design then has the filter neatly covering where you'd normally put the faucet. But you get it full, turn it on, and it boils, that much works. Next be *very* careful pouring it and do so very slowly: the lid does not seal against the sides and boiling water escapes from more than just the notched spout. After this the lack of a water level indicator is just a minor nuisance.If you need a smart looking kitchen, it is perfect. If you need something functional for making hot water, it is far from perfect."
5,"Fast, Looks Great, Easy to Clean","This electric tea kettle was the best purchase I have made in awhile. I was sort of put off by the price, but this kettle is worth it. It looks great sitting on my counter-top and heats water to a rapid boil in minutes.PROS:- Looks awesome. It's very shiny and lets me check out how badly I need to shave in the morning. Also matches all my other stainless steel appliances.- Heats up water to very hot in just a few minutes- Easy to clean- Has a filter to keep all the solids inside. It's also easy to remove to clean.- Flip top lid with button release = easy filling and dumping- Always cool to the touch and impossible to burn yourself onCONS:- Only one I can see is that it fits more like 5 cups of water rather than 8, but that didn't bother me too much because it's extremely fast"
4,very good,I like this stainless steel kettle because it is detached from the base. When the water boils it turns itself off. the water stays hot for a long while. It is easy to clean inside and out. The lid pivots for filling and pouring water. The minor item I dont like is that it is not easy to fill it with the lid closed . I keep the lid open for filling and pouring.
1,Sent it back,"The top never fit on it. Ridiculous! The appearance is attractive enough. So, I wonder why the basics weren't covered."
2,Takes very long to pop up,"I purchased this product because of it's stainless interior, it's quality and style, but I was surprised to see that the automatic pop up doesn't work properly, after the water reaches boiling, it would continue to bubble for at least a minute or two, (and for boiling water that's allot, making wet the whole cabinet above it from the steam) till it finally stops, I have had other Kettle's (cheaper) that popped immediately as water reached boiling."
2,8 cups,"You can only fill half of the kettle for maximum. I measure the water, only around 1100 ml(about 5 cups) but it says 8 cups."
3,Needs More Bike Building,"I bought this game as most probably have because they love the show. So I get home pop it in the PS2 and this is when I realize you can not build a bike anytime you want. I like the idea for missions in the game but I also want to be able to design bikes at any time. Instead I have beat a bunch of missions to build two total bikes so far in the game. Maybe something happens after you beat the game, but Im at 92% complete and cannot figure out how to unlock the extra missions yet. Not to mention some missions are difficult and irritating. The missons are either long, or you have to drive perfect for like 8 minutes. The thing I hate the most is the traffic that stops or angles out a front end for no reason and you fall off the bike. If I wanted an racing game that enrages me I would have bought one, I want a bike building game. I would recommend renting before buying to see how you like the game."
4,"good, but could be better","This game is great if you love the show. The game is overall great but there our some flas. Like you have to beat missions to start building bikes and you can only use the analog stick to move, but the worst thing of all is when you wreck the camra angle gets all odd and you watch yourself fall. Overall the game is great and if you love the show you will love the game"
4,American Choppers Love 'em or Leave 'em,"If you're a fan of the show, you'll like the game. The only big things I didn't like, it didn't have a side view button so you could check it out from the side and my remote control would let me assign the buttons I prefer for the gas and brake. It should have had more bikes to build and it was kind of shallow. I'm a big fan of the show so it was well worth the money I paid for the game. terribleatom"
1,Big waste of time and money,"To be honest I love the television series American Chopper.This game was not in stores, so I bought it. BIG MISTAKE! This game barely has a resemblence to the series. The cut scenes look like playstation 1 graphics. Also when you build your chopper the options are limited. On American Chopper I never saw Paulie do missions or race. When you are racing, he makes stupid sounds when you pass him. I never saw Hex or that guy with the patch over his eye on the series. Must have missed that episode, lol. I tried to sell this game at a yard sale for 10 dollars and a kid said it was too much. He must have played the game before. Dont ever spend any amount of money on this worthless chewtoy for your dog."
3,CHOPPPERS,"This game is pretty fun. Especially if you like the tv show. The only thing that would make it better is if there was a free ride mode ware you can take any bike that's unlocked and ride where ever and whenever you want. The only way you can play this game is in career mode where you complete certain tasks in order to earn parts for your own custom chopper. Once your career is over and you have beat the game, there is nothing left do do, but start over again. Kind of boring. I hope they will add more game modes and options if they make an American Choppers 2 game."
3,Cute Toy ----- But,"This is a really cute toy but I was searching for a replacement for a certain grey mouse to replace the one my pug has chosen since she was a puppy. Can't find it anywhere. While this one is a mouse and is the right color, she doesn't like it! Go figure! That's a pug for you!"
4,floppy dog flops in the shipping department,"While I loved these toys almost as much as my Labrador retriever, the shipping was an absolute pain! Please convey to your merchant that shipping to an APO address is no different from shipping to a PO Box in the US!"
5,I love Sure Fit,"I love my Sure Fit. Now it looks like Sure Fit ([...]) is researching creating sectional slipcovers. If enough people take their survey (look on the lower part of their home page to take the survey. It's called ""Have a sectional?""), maybe they'll start making them. I just filled out the survey and hope to receive word that they are available soon!"
3,"Love this show, both auditory and visual, but...","Quality of the transfer to the DVD is subpar, they decided to cram everything (if you can call a little over 2 hours everything). Not really a lot of extras if thats your thing. The stroies were great though - I watched all 1 disk of this in a single sitting and I laughed and cried, sometimes at the same time. Its shows like this that make paying for cable worthwhile."
5,One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time.,"What an incredible introduction to a new author. THE CLEANSING is easily one of the best, most enjoyable books I've read in a long time. Not since King's THE STAND have I been so unhappy about finishing a novel. It was a joy to read from the opening paragraph until the last page. At times horrific, intriguing and endearing, it grabs your full attention and never lets go. Each of John D. Harvey's characters, both major and minor, are multi-dimensional and unique with their own distinct voices. The reader will even find themselves empathizing with the villain in this book, a preternatural wolf named Wanata, who not only wreaks terror wherever he goes but is, himself, struggling with his own crises. Don't let the cover price keep you from grabbing this one! You won't be disappointed."
4,Good product,"Nice daisy chain, If it's bought along with the 1 spot adapter, just make sure to avoid using all the connectors, since it could overload the adapter and you'll have noise problems and performance issues, if you use 4 analog pedals connected (as I do) there won't be any problem, I had to play around and also realized that some pedals might use little more power on their funtions, so what I do is that I have a 1 spot adapter connected to a power strip with my 3 boss pedals and a Wah, and in the other power strip slot I have another generic adapter connected with my MXR noise clamp so it doesn't interferes with them. I works just fine."
4,This has me re-thinking how I power my board,"All in all I think this is a really good product. Like a previous reviewer said, it would have been nice if there was a little more space between the plugs, but I just added another quiet wall wart for that pedal. I'm having better luck with wall warts keeping hum off the board then I did with a pedal board power supply. With a couple of these with a couple quiet wall warts I'm able to power all the pedals on my Pedaltrain Pro board."
4,Just what a pedalphile needs.,"I bought this to supplement my current 1-spot, so now instead of being able to power just five pedals, I can power nine! My only complaints are:1. When I use this on my delay, there is a fairly audible hum. If my delay has its own power source, there is no hum at all. The pedal is probably more to blame than the 1-Spot extension, but I thought I'd mention it.2. I wish there was a bit more space in between plugs. It's not normally an issue, but when I have to plug my honkin' wah in, I have to make it stretch just a bit more than I'd like it to.Good product, though. Will save you hundreds on batteries, and more than a power strip of space."
5,It works.,I only need it for 2 pedals so I haven't tested this extensively. It works and doesn't give me any noise.
1,Great if you need a noise generator,"I recently purchased this to power my delay and tuner pedals. It did that just fine. What it also did was create a significant hum throughout the system. I pinpointed it to this product by adjusting where on the chain each of the items was connected. When connected closest to the power supply the noise was less, and even then unbearable but once an item was connected to the 4th or 5th connector on the chain the hum was significantly louder. By removing this and powering only the delay or the tuner (and using the batteries for the other item) the noise was gone."
5,Extension lead for Visual Sound 1 SPOT Space-Saving 9V Adapter,"Run out of power leads of your Visual Sound 1 SPOT Space-Saving 9V Adapter.This gives you another 4/5 pedals' power.If you already have the 1 spot, and need to plug in more pedals (subject to tthe standard compatibility warning), then you can't go wrong."
3,only 5 spots...could really use 1 or 2 more!,"Works great with the OneSpot, I've had one for awhile with no problem. If I had my wish, I'd have 1 or 2 extra connections on it...if you don't have a big pedalboard, this should work fine for you!"
2,Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable,"I started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked, but when I tried to add a second/third stomp box, I couldn't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz. I returned this product I did further testing, I would not recommend it to anyone. With my personal experience in mind, I would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply. hope this helps"
2,The book is fine but...........,The book is everything I expected but the DVD that comes with it doesn't work. I tried it in every player I have but the only thing I got in return was a loud whirring noise that continued endlessly. It finally worked in my laptop but I could barely here the instructor over the noise of the disc. So I'm going to send it back and if that DVD actually works then I will update my rating for this item.
2,Not Enough Information!,"When I bought this C.D. I was under the impression that the songs listed were actually performed by the bands that wrote them. I should have known since the bands were not listed, but since there was no listing of who was performing the songs--like most tribute albums--I actually was naive enough to believe I would be listening to Iron Maiden, Ozzy, Metallica, etc... Instead this is at best a tribute album that could have been performed by anyone. Some of the songs aren't that bad, and the unknown singers do a reasonable job of faking the vocalists they are copying, but overall this was a huge disappointment."
1,COVER BAND ALERT,"I bought the CD version of this album from that other online CD dealer. If you read the teeny print on the back of the cd, it reads, ""All newly recorded, digitally mastered music by The Hit Crew""While they're admittedly a pretty good cover band, particularly when they're doing old Black Sabbeth tracks, this is not a recording by the original artists."
2,buyer beware,"the promo for this product looked great! I should have looked a lot closer. All songs are recorded by ""the crew"" and is musically proficient but not the same. I thought these songs were the original releases. I was wrong. I guess these songs would work great in an elevator or the DMV; I just needed the originals."
3,"Nice idea, so-so execution","The PC software used for programming the remote is very easy to use and a nice surprise coming from the kings of bad user interface design--Microsoft. You will have no trouble setting it up nor will it be difficult to modify the setup at a later date. Unfortunately, the remote itself eats batteries (I use NiMH rechargeables, but they still only last a month or so) and the touch screen is balky (it has trouble accurately sensing pressure at the edges in particular.) You can do anything with this remote, but its just not the panacea I had hoped for. I would not recommend it, nor would I condemn anyone for buying it. If you have very, very complicated home theater needs, it will certainly be able to meet them."
1,Dog slow,"I tried one of these (I forget if it was this exact model, but it was one of the two or three using the MS co-developed platform) in a local show room and the scrolling response was abyssmal --- on the order of a second to go from one menu item to the next. I would make sure to get hands on before buying."
1,Check out the Philips Pronto,"I almost bought this remote. I am a strong follower of Microsoft products and I still have to speak poorly of this one. For the money, the Philips Pronto is a far better value. The Pronto will control any number of devices where the Take Control can handle only 15. Also, the Take Control is all text based that you scroll through, but the Pronto will let you design your own remote with any number of screens. You can even import better looking buttons. I highly recommend the Pronto."
2,"Big, Heavy, Dumb.","I've wanted a programmable touch-screen remote for a long time. While I worked at microsoft, I saw details for the prototype before it was released and decided I just had to get one.Big mistake. For one, I shouldn't have expected so much from a microsoft product.The unit itself is big and heavy, enough to be inconvenient. It's only BARELY configurable without plugging it into a computer. If you don't have a windows machine to use to configure it, you're stuck with the pre-defined layouts which are nearly useless. If you do manage to customize it with your computer, it ALMOST becomes usable, but the size and slowness of the operating system make it more worthwhile to just find your real remotes.My TC-1000 has been sitting on the lower shelf of my coffee table for 4 months, gathering dust."
3,The Fubulous Fifties (used CD),"Good oldies on this CD, however,one of thesongs on the used CD I ordered skips.I would have like to known that before Iplaced my order.Izzy Cruz"
4,The Elements of Hitting,"The Elements of Hitting was something I picked up because of my love of Baseball, figuring it was another Dad and Son connect through ""the Game"" story. But it was much more than that. It illustrates how life throws curveballs and how you react to them, do you get into the game or sit on the sidelines. The use of the chapters switching back and forth between Walter Innis' current thoughts and his memories makes for an interesting read."
4,Very Good Book,"This was a very good book focusing not only the aspects of baseball, but more towards the aspects of life."
2,Sad Beyond The Story,"This is the kind of book that with a better writer may have had a chance. Instead, it's just another poorly executed story by a writer without a lot of talent. The story of the loser son, his fighting and uneducated parents and the tenuous baseball connection around which its story is hatched rings hollow and is perhaps only sightly more compelling reading than the minutes from a local school board meeting. None of the characters are well developed, the story is tired, the stakes are low. I struggled to finish this book and probably only did so because every now and then Jones would break from his formulaic characterizations and predictable plot for a quick flourish of imagination and inspiration. The Elements of Hitting is sad as a story and as a book. It takes a depressing story, which in better hands should have been interesting, and leaves it stranded at first base while the writer strikes out without so much as taking a good swing. And that's sad."
1,Unbearably bad book,"To give you an idea about how little merit should be placed in this author's work, consider this: of the four example problems used in the book, three of them are solved incorrectly! Once again an education professor proves how useless a degree in education really is. As a math teacher and math major, I advocate for the content experts over the so-called education experts. The whole book can be summed up by the following observation: ""Word problems in most math textbooks seem contrived."" So? They're useful tools to gradually warm up to real-world math applications which may be more useful but are certainly less beautiful. I was hoping for an honest critique of math education, what I got was a petulant diatribe on the nature of word problems. Disappointing to the Nth degree!"
5,A must for anyone wanting to improve education,"This book literally changed my life. It helped me be brave enough to think critically and creatively about learning and teaching. Some of the things we hold as ""gospel truth"" DO need to be re-examined.Michael Smith helps explode lots of myths surrounding math education, but more importantly reminds us of what the Holy Grail is... helping every student discover their UNIQUE potential.By the way, Humble Pi triggered thoughts and images that lead me on my own journey resulting in me writing my own book --a ""children's book"" called The North Star. Thanks, Michael Smith!Peter Reynolds Massachusetts"
5,19th century poetry with 21st century sensibility,"Back in high school I struggled through Red Badge of Courage. Likewise, Crane's novel about a young prostitute, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, bored me in college. But along the way I discovered that Crane wrote poetry as well. His poetry is not the sentimental and genteel poetry often associated with the 19th century. His aggresive free-verse is more an agonized scream and a punch in the gut. Crane delights in calling out hypocrisy and exposing it to the light of day.Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce and H.L. Menken were the ""paragons of pessimism"" during their days. To that group add the voice of Stephen Crane who was their equal in expressing the cynicism of the age; but Crane's cynicism often came wrapped around a seed of hope for mankind.Both this volume and The Black Riders and Other Lines are highly recommended."
5,Stupid Not to Buy It,"With out a doubt, this is one of the best albums I have heard all year. These guys are able to slam together hard power riffs and then follow it up with smoothe transitions into dynomite melodies. They album will have you singing along just as much as screaming along.I also got the chance to check these guys out at the beginning of the summer with a static lullaby, and they certainly didnt disapoint. My only complaint was that their set was too short (but for an opening band...they all are right?)-i wanted to hear more cause they really ARE that good live.So if you like good slammin tunes i recommend picking up this album and checkin em out live. It'd probably even be cheaper to catch em live first and then buy the album right from the band vendors. Either way, best coin ive spent on an album and a show in a long time."
4,Surprising Screamo With A Rock Twist,"I bought this album the other day and with having a collection of nearly 800 cd's it takes something interesting to catch my attention. Like the rest of you the whole emo/screamo scene is starting to bore me with bands like the used only capable of holding my interest. However this album rocks its starts out with a statement from the singer which immediately catches your attention, each song flows nicely with the emo 'make tonight' and breathe underwater being personal favourites. This is one of my picks for new band of the year. Do Yourself a favour and buy this album and rock out like a motherf**ker!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent toy for your budding Archaelogist,"My 6 year old son received this for his birthday and LOVED it! It is a huge brick and it comes w/ safetly goggles, a chistle and a hammer. You have to chip away at this huge brick to get to the bones of whatever dinosaur you bought. Then you get to put it all together and then paint it! It took my son and I a few hours to do the whole thing and it now sits on his shelf in his room. A GREAT toy. My son was running around like a crazy man when he found his first bone. He felt like a real live archaelogist!"
2,"Good book, but exercises assume too much of the student.","I am using this book in my first year of latin in college. I confess that I can't compare this book to any others as I haven't read any others; nevertheless, the exercises are very hard and use concepts in one chapter that aren't discussed until later chapters."
3,Good if you already have some idea about correct Latin,"The Jenney text is a good book if you are not a first time teacher of Latin. I have used it for the past two years, and the errors in the answer key are enough to drive me and my more conscientious students to defenestrate the thing. We do, however, like the arrangement of the text and the features such as the cultural items at teh beginning of each lesson and the phrases to use. We do not like the way it gets so hard so fast!! We could not finish more than 25 lessons with any degree of comfort level with our mastery of it. If I did not have other texts for reference, I would not feel confident in the accuracy of some of the grammatical information in the text. Many of the explanations of specific grammar points are vague-- especially several of the ablative constructions. They tend to all start to sound the same after lesson 20. Just some food for thought."
3,16 MONTH OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED THIS TOY!,THIS TOY WAS FOR MY 16 MONTH OLD GRANDDAUGHTER FOR HALLOWEEN. SHE HUGGED IT AND LOVES IT.
4,"Distinctively unique, and funny!","This book of poetry definately has a unique twist, I found the poems in this book to be filled with humour; also the topics were clear there is something good in this book for any one who enjoys poetry."
2,It leaves you with the question: how to use the modes.,"I bought this one seven years ago. This book is mostly an inventory of the modes: it gives you the scales, the relative and parallel approach and some cool melodic patterns, but the question remains: how to use them: there are no chord progressions here. Now I know there are better resources: Don Mock's Modal Mojo , Chad Johnson's Guitarist Guide to Scales over Chords or Tom Kolb's Modes for Guitar give really good information and examples,which this book lacks."
1,Straw Polemic,"The entire argument presented here is a straw man. Mainstream environmentalists have never even attempted to enforce vegetarianism or ban people from national parks, as suggested by this book.""Well, it's exaggerated for satire."" you might say. Except that the book admits that watching out for the environment is a good principle. So it's claiming the ground of reasonable environmentalism for itself, while painting the people who actually do that work as an extremist enemy. I wonder what Ms. Pride would characterize as good environmental ideas beyond just assuming that everyone and every company will judiciously avoid damaging the environment and responsibly clean up after themselves if theres a mistake.We should all be teaching kids to think critically about current issues, in a way and on a level they can grasp; but that's not what's done here. This is pure political propaganda that distorts the issues and facts to con kids into an adult agenda."
2,Total troll-bait. :),"So, if this is supposed to be a gag gift for conservation-minded friends, I think it's absolutely brilliant. It is so straight-faced that it's hysterically funny.Of course, if you are thinking of actually getting this for a child, as a ""Christian alternative"" to Suess's ""The Lorax,"" (of which it's an obvious knock-off), I wouldn't waste your money. The art is amateurish, the rhymes weak, and it's so busy being self-indulgently righteous that it misses being something kids would have fun reading. Ironically, it ends up a lot like the overly finger-wagging environmentalist it's trying to put down.But hey, it makes great troll bait!"
3,easy to understand,Most men know everthing in this book. Weddings are a female thing. Most men would rather run off to Vegas or the local court house.
5,Gave to my future son-in-law,"I gave this to my future son-in-law so he wouldn't feel so left out, but more importantly, so his mother would realize it's my daughter's wedding not hers. Worked both ways. I haven't read it, but so far, so good."
5,The best groom's book out there,"All of the other books for grooms are condescending, treat the groom like he's an idiot, or warn him about his ""bridezilla"". This one's the antithesis of all of that, and actually provides good information for the groom with a question about any part of the wedding. It doesn't need to be read cover-to-cover, and provides a positive spin on handling tough situations."
3,NICE CHRISTMAS MUSIC,Nice variety of music for the holidays. I noticed several guests singing along during holiday festivities. Quite a few favorites.
3,Very Good,"Some songs just didn't do it for me because I wasn't use to that particular artist singing them. Overall, not a bad choice for soulful holiday sounds."
4,Very useful book,"This book provides a huge amount of helpful information for amateur Scrabble players who want to improve their game. When my husband and I got it six or seven years ago we used it to help learn three letter words. That was only the beginning. The book has chapters on high point tiles, the best tiles for making sevens and much more. The part I like is best is the exhaustive list of anagrams (which for some reason the authors call alphagrams) - great for the player who thought he or she had a seven couldn't come up with one, and wants to see after the game whether one was out there."
2,Be very careful,Young kids should not play with this. If a child (or adult for that matter) swallow 2 or more of these and it can bind their intestines. Keep away from small children.
3,"I miss Grade, but I guess this will do","first of all, this band is not following the scene and joining the bandwagon. The members of this band created what is the screamo/ emocore scene today. This album isn't bad, and all of you emo kids will eat it up. its got good clean vocals with decent music behind it. And for the person who claimed that once you hear one victory band that you've heard them all.. go listen to Dead to Fall and say the same thing."
1,What the hell?,"DO NOT listen to what that sticker tells you..the used, AFI, and Muse are way better bands/different styles than the BLack Maria...this cd is not worth the money..i am really dissapointed"
4,Better then i expected,"When i first heard of the band and the cd i expected them to be exactly like taking back sunday or hawethorne heights(hate both of them) but even though some tracks may sound like them they are less emo and more towards the punk side. However, the label states they sound like AFI and Muse. They sound nothing like them. The song closest to a AFI song would be ""Rats in the Prison"" and the closest to Muse ""Ash"" but overall they sound nothing like those two bands.I think they're a pretty good band and would be good for the fans of Taking Back Sunday mixed with a little bit of punk."
1,BORING!,"The tape is a short loop of a small cheesy home made aquarium...hardly any fish, and the few in there are as dull as one can get. The quality of the tape is so poor that the picture all seems to be one color.....so unlike a professional saltwater aquarium and film presentation....a real flop!"
1,"Poor quality, poor visibility of fish.","There is nothing tropical about this video. The fish appear to be freshwater, no color other than silver and blur. My copy had tracking lines that appeared periodically through out the tape. Two thumbs down."
1,Avoid...,Appalling sound quality. Even the most casual listener couldn't fail to cringe at this! Great album much improved by the extra tracks on the expanded version (which is issued on a very reliable label). You've been warned!!!
3,Good,"It is a good battery, but I thought it would give me a little more talk time than the original. It's about the same."
1,did not work properly,"Did not work properly, most products I but from Acessory one I have no problems w/ so I didnt ask for my m oney back & I did not contact them for a refund or to complain. (it was $3)"
4,Works fine as advertised,At least for me it has more battery life than the stock one shipped with my TYTN/8525/Hermes. It fits fine and charges quickly. No problems at all.
5,Great service !,Battery is as ordered and shipping was timely. I would do business with this company again without hesitation.
4,Another winner!,"I have read many of Tracie Peterson's other books, so I eagerly picked this one up. This is an interesting story about trust. If you don't your family, can you bring yourself to trust your feelings? Alex's father is a rat, basically--always throwing his infidelities in her mother's face. Seeing this has soured her on all men. Luke is her friend, and he loves her but cannot bring himself to tell her.THere is betrayal, murder, mystery and romance all wrapped up in 370 pages. A fast read that will have you perched on the edge of your seat. Enjoy!"
4,Tracie is wonderful,"When I picked up this book I thought it would be ok. It was wonderful I couldnt put it down. I thought that the one girl shouldnt have been hurt like she did, but it was a good story about Alex and how she learns to trust and love."
1,So many mistakes,"This may be the worst road atlas on the market today. There are multiple errors on just about every map. The 2006 edition states that the Westpark Tollway in Houston will open in 2004. It did, but they forgot to update the map. Capitol Reef National Park in Utah has misteriously disappeared. The Big Island of Hawaii is shown with several divided highways (they're actually single lane roads). I could go on and on..."
5,AWESOME......,Chris Grabenstein is an excellent writter. Holds your interest from beginning to end. Exciting characters. Ceepak & Danny rule!! I didn't want the book to end.
4,"Very comfortable, but be carefull","These shoes are very comfortable and have a great arch which was important to me. My only negative is that they are very slippery when trying to walk on wet pavement. The shoes slip as though you are on ice, so that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Black addiction walker brooks shoes,"I was unable to find this shoe, in black, in my size at the old online company. I was happy to find this at Amazon.com I will continue to need this shoe in black, and I also purchase the same shoe in white, but not as often. I'm glad it was available! Very quick shipping!"
4,good bit but long,I ordered two of these bits to replace one that broke. I was expecting the same size bit but these are about twice as long as the bit I broke. They work great and I haven't had a problem with them in my router table but if I used them in my hand-held router they I might not be able to do a shallow cut.
3,Indices of credibility are relatively useful,"Evidence is written for people deliberating on a policy position. As such, it seems written from a debate coach's frame of reference. Ideally, decision-makers in government and elsewhere should be aware of Newman's indices of credibility. Sadly, too often they are not. Academics judging the credibility of sources such as newspaper reports should find Evidence useful in evaluating the press. Much of Evidence deals with conflicts such as the Viet Nam war, and there are obvious lessons to be learned about credibility of sources during that war. If there is a weakness in Evidence it is the absence of checks on the accuracy of reports of documents, e.g., news reports summarizing government documents. That, of course, is much easier today than when Evidence was published. A check on logic of sources would also have strengthened the book."
1,not good for snoring,"I bought these earplugs to allow me to sleep with one who snores. It muffled the noise slightly, but not enough to help with sleeping."
3,Color Atlas of Normal Cytology,"One of the very few cytology books dealing with the normal cytology of various body sites. It is very well known fct that to learn abnormal things you have to know normal things first. I found the book very useful when dealing with cytology slides from breast lesions suspicious of malignant cells, especially when the differentiation of malignant cells from normal cells was difficult. Also useful were chapters on salivary glands and female genital tract."
4,A comic giant still at the peak of his powers,"Carl Reiner is clearly a comic genius -- as a performer with Mel Brooks, as the director of numerous film comedies including ""The Jerk"" and in more recent years as an author. This collection is subtle but still another impressive part of his legacy"
2,Rushed,"While this book is a decent size for a graphic novel , the scenes are rushed, just as something is heating up , it moves on.The artwork, although color, is just average for detail, try Paris Quinn or Duvet if you're looking for something a little more exciting."
2,Twenty (Not Janice),"For some reason the Amazon title for this books reads ""Twenty (Trouble of Janice)"" but this book has nothing to do with Erich Von Gotha's ""Janice"" series other than he drew both of them. Unfortunately Twenty is very unlike Janice and doesn't have a lot going for it. The story is negligible and the artwork is not up to par with the Janice comics. Even as a Von Gotha fan I can't really recommend this book. You're much better off seeking out any of his other titles."
1,twenty,"This was not what I expected.I thought this was going to be reading, not a picture book. Needless to say I was disappointed."
4,VHS Cassette Adapter,My Son lost my original vhs adapter that came WITH my vcr so I purchased a replacement .
4,Valuable Insights,"I have a completely different take on this book than the last reviewer. While I haven't completed it yet, either, what I have read has helped me to deal with my own daughter's rage with more LOVE (which is the KEY to the whole concept). I am a teacher and work directly with children on a daily basis,as well as a single mom.I've have dealt with anger issues all my life. Not only my own anger, but my family of origin and my (now 16) daughter. I wish I had a book like this when my daughter was a toddler!I plan to continue reading with an OPEN MIND, and use what I can in my work with children and anger. I have already noticed a 'shift' in the way my daughter and I relate...it is more loving and I am able to deal much more effectively with the out of control anger that she has displayed so often. That is dissapating also, as I become more aware of my role and how I can best meet her needs as an Indigo.It is a very helpful book and well worth exploring!"
4,"A must read for parents, teachers, counselors, pediatricians","I was honored to have Dianne ask me to preview her book and write a recommendation. I found the book to be very informative, inspirational, and encouraging for the adults who have the respsonsibility to be guides and helpers for these very gifted children who are being born. As a pediatrician, I have seen many of these children, and have worked with some in my own homeopathy practice. I am very grateful to have a book like this to help me understand these children and their needs."
2,well...,"The first two days I could see a difference but then my teeth started to get darker instead of whitening it. Not buying this again. It kind of worked for my mom though, it probably works for people with very yellow teeth. It tastes so weird and it leaves your tongue feeling slightly strange, like numb or something."
4,Pretty Good,"This does what it says it does. However, for the money, I have found that Crest/Colgate? (It's in the bright red box) does an equally amount of whitening and is a lot cheaper."
4,love love love,I love this toothpaste. It makes my gums healthier and my teeth squeeky clean. The whitening is gentle and does not irritate my gums. I cannot go back to the store brands!! Just wish it wasnt so pricey
2,NO WHITENING YET!!!! :(,I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I am still waiting for my teeth to whiten. I thought I would see a difference by now but nothing...I am super disappointed but i will continued to use the product till i finish it because I bought it... I don't want my money going to waste....don't buy this product go to a denist for a professional whitening.
3,Super white,I thought that the toothpaste would make my teeth super white. It did whiten them but I still have slight yellowing on the bottom teeth. I wish that this could be removed with this toothpaste.
1,Don't Beleave It!,"I have used this item for a few weeks now, and it only works right after you use it, once you dring coffee or have tea or anything else, your teeth look just like they did before."
1,Terrible Product,"This is the worst whitening system I've ever used! It created canker sores all over my tongue, it was extremely painful, and to top it off, it didn't even work!"
1,Doesn't work,I really wanted this to work and used it religiously. I had read that it works on caps etc but it doesn't work at all.
2,Just so so,"I purchased the whitening system and the accelerating mouthwash all together. I have not been impressed with the level of whitening they have delivered, and they did make my teeth hurt from time to time. I have finished all of the products and have not seen any real noticeable results. My teeth are not terribly stained, I just need a pick me up every 6 months or so from my coffee and red wine habits. This definitely didn't do it. I have had much more success from Crest Whitestrips and will go back to using those when I need whitening."
1,All Hype.,"There is Nothing Special about this toothpaste as far as I can tell. I did not have terribly stained teeth when I started, but I drink a lot of coffee so I like to use whitening toothpaste and occasional white strips.This did nothing more than any Crest Whitening Toothpaste, which I usually use. I saw NO DIFFERENCE at all in appearance and, in fact, my teeth felt less clean. I use a sonicare toothbrush and I felt this toothpaste did not have enough grit or something. I wanted to brush my teeth 3 or 4 times a day, instead of my usual 2 because they just felt kind of slimy or something.Also, it is a pain in the a$$ to use the 2 tubes. Can they not utilize the technology developed by Aquafresh or other brands where the 2 types of paste are separated but both flow from a single tube or canister? Nothing special here at all. Total Hype."
1,"Small, overpriced, doesn't really whiten",It's too overpriced for the amount of paste and it doesn't whiten my teeth. I give it three stars because it does clean the teeth and it prevents from build up of tartar.UPDATE------ RUINS TEETH ENAMEL!! MAKES TEETH SENSITIVE!!! BE WARNED. DONT USE IT!
5,Great for the Money!!,"Well I had some stains on my teeth and I definitely wanted them whiter. After reading the reviews on here I decided to try it and boy am I glad!! My stains were gone completely by the fourth day and my teeth are definitely whiter than before. I even had someone ask me how my teeth were so white. I dont think you are going to get those super super white teeth that you would get from a pro job but this def helps. For the money I think it does an excellent job. Its so easy to use, no sitting around with that nasty plastic stuff in your mouth or trays for 30-45 min. Just brush your teeth for two minutes twice a day. The tubes are small but you only use a pearl size amount of each. I havent noticed any tooth sensitivity yet and I have been using it almost a month. I would order it again and will prob order some for my hubby too."
3,Slightly Lightens,This toothpaste should be cheaper. It does lighten the color of your teeth but not dramatically. This is a worthwhile purchase if you just buy the toothpaste not this exact one with the whitening excelerator.
3,It's just ok,This product is overpriced in my opinion. For what it does - crest whitening can do the same. Nothing to write home about or tell your friends to run out and buy. Just another ploy to get you to spend a lot of $ on little product. Most whitening toothpastes in stores do just-as-good-a job if not better. Save your $ and head to the grocery store.
4,Super Smile,"I hsve been using SuperSmile for about 9 months, I love coffee and will not give it up, but that stains my teeth, Supersmile fixes that problem and I can still enjoy my coffee"
2,"Wanted to love it,","I tried this product after reading the reviews. I truly wanted the product to work for me. I used it as directed for close to a week. My teeth became so sensitive that breathing actually HURT. I saw no lightening in my teeth either, so I discontinued use. I wish it had been a workable product for me. However, it was a waste of money in my experience. :("
5,Great Product,Gentle and effective for helping to remove stains. I recommend this product and will order it again in the future.
2,Not great - works somewhat,"Been using this for a month and notice some whitening, but not what I expected. Too $$$ for what it does."
3,"Works, but ....","The Supersmile Whitening System does its job of lightening tooth color, although you're never going to get those shining white celebrity teeth without veneers. Nonetheless, I found Supersmile easy to use and effective on achieving several shades of tooth lightening. It worked quicker than competing products, and, at the price, it should. Supersmile is still much cheaper than dental office whitening and achieves the same time limited effect.I initially ordered the starter system. It was effective, so I then ordered the larger economy size for future use. Big mistake. The larger tubes use a thick plastic that makes it difficult to squeeze the last half of the toothpaste out of the tube, effectively wasting it.Brush your teeth twice a day, rinse after meals, and floss daily. Still the best way for your teeth to look good and stay healthy. If you've got some yellow, Supersmile is effective in lightening the color and reducing the amount of plaque. Just don't buy the large size tubes."
4,I think it actually works!,I purchased this hoping that it would whiten my teeth that had been veneered...and I think it actually works! Nothing else has ever worked despite testimonials that said they would and were of course very costly. My husband was impressed and started using my toothpaste and his teeth too are whiter. I'm very impressed.
3,Didnt notice much of a difference,"My teeth felt cleaner after using this paste. It would've worked better I'm sure if I'd have bought more and used it longer. Supersmile has a good reputation. It used to be sold at Sephora and is still sold at bath and Body works. One of the best tooth whiteners after professional whitening, dentist whitening kits and gosmile."
1,Super Smile- Worth it or Not?,"After reading many reviews I bought this product, I have to see if you want great whitening results you are better off buying Crest Professional Effects for $43.99 at Walmart. I haven't noticed anything different with this toothpaste than the Crest Brand Whitening toothpaste at a substantially cheaper price. Nothing Whitens like Crest White Strips, save your money and don't buy this toothpaste, spend 10 bucks more and it'll be well worth it."
1,Rip off,"I recently purchased the Super Smile Professional Whitening system. I did not work, I called their Customer Service and was told to return the product (even after I told them I bought it on Amazon) and they would refund the purchase price but not the postage. I returned it and about a week later the unused tubes were returned to me with a note saying they will not refund or exchange the product. They said there was no record in their system I bought it (I told them I bought it on Amazon!). This product does not work and customer service gives you the run around."
1,Supersmile Whitening System,I am still waiting for my product after two weeks and have not received it. I just would like to get my products already. This is a nightmare!
2,Not really as pictured,"The product I received was all right but not really what I thought it would be, and the picture makes it hard to tell. I thought this would be the kind of mat with little raised ""fingers"" to get dirt off your shoe treads. The one I received has big raised square areas, which isn't nearly as effective. Also, pay attention to the listed dimensions, since this seems larger than standard mats."
2,"Well, the acne patches came just in time. ...","Well, the acne patches came just in time. I had a nice trial area right on my chin. After two nights with the patches, the size of the pimple was slightly reduced. That wasn't the effect I was looking for! On the other hand, these patches don't seem to dry out my skin like many other acne treatments. All in all, though, I don't think they're worth the money."
2,Just didn't make it !,Very disjointed. I had to reread it to find Andrew as a character. .Characters were very weak.. It had all the ingredients for a great book but it never came together. I would have put it down if it had not been required reading.
1,no title,"How I loathed, absolutely loathed this book. Almost three solid weeks of plodding. And I did so much like her other book ""African Laughter"". But this! Narcissistic, if ever I read one. Lessing at 70 or so is saying, ""Here, look at me! At how wonderfully I write."" To ask the reader to believe that three men, all under the age of 40, are in love with a 65-year-old woman, is ludicrous. And that she, who, hopefully would have gained some insight and wisdom by now, is so grief-stricken over the loss of the 35-year-old (whom she never sleeps with or even kisses or seems to have any meaningful conversations with) that it takes two years to get over, is simply beyond my suspension of disbelief. These people never really talk to one another, never, ever say what they think, at least what Lessing says they think. The world of theatre and its convulsive relationships. I think not."
4,Very well adapted,"THE CROOKED MAN is not a faithful adaptation of the original story, but it is a good one. Visual media differ from print, and one must make allowances for this. It's a fine mystery in its own right with a very convincing Indian flashback. Jeremy Brett is a little more brusque than usual in this episode but is still the definitive Holmes. I love the shot where he measures out clues in an extreme longshot that reduces him to little more than a black stick figure on screen. The other actors are all first rate and this is a very atmospheric and eerie episode."
4,Clear and well written,"This is a well organized book full of useful facts that show how our political history has evolved over the years. Full of antdotes and trivia, the book reveals quite a bit about America. Very well condenced stories of each election. Reports things as historical facts rather than a political leaning (except for the 1988 race maybe). Overall a very good read."
1,"Not pre-seasoned, Not non-stick","This is no different from any other cast iron cooking product. You do have to season it before you can use it and it requires the same care as ordinary cast iron. The ""non-stick"" coating isn't like any non-stick coating I have ever seen. Food sticks quite easily. If you are looking for a large cast iron wok and that is all, this wok may do the trick. But do not expect easy cleaning or a non stick surface."
1,Wok,We followed instructions on how to get ready before first use. FORGET IT! It did it did not work.WE had to do three times and the WOK now looks very old and not worth the time I researched to purchas it.
2,Item not complete,The item came without its own packaging...just thrown in a large box with the other items I ordered. It was also without the long handle. Was a gift and person who received it may have a handle from an old wok to use that would work. Just disappointed in general.
4,Good Finish,"I agree with the previous reviews in that this one moved a little slow and took a little longer to read. I am not from Seattle, actually I have never been there, so the apparent errors in geography did not effect my enjoyment of the book. I still think it's worth the purchase price and will continue to read her work."
5,THE KILL moves at breathtaking speed,"Allison Brennan has handed her readers yet another incredible thriller. Olivia St. Martin as ""Livie"" has lived with survivor's guilt since the death of her older sister. The only thing helping her make it through each day is knowing the man who abducted her sister - the man she testified against - is behind bars...until DNA turns him loose.The story takes off and never slows down while she joins forces with Police Detective Zack Travis to stop a serial killer on the loose.Allison's first two brilliant novels were just a warm up for THE KILL."
5,a new favorite author!,Allison Brennan quickly has become one of my top 5 favorite authors. She delivers with full bodied characters and exciting story line.
3,The same story thrice,Albeit this is a good book and so well paced that you won't be able to put it down is almost a copy of its prequels:The plot:In the three books is the same. Twenty years or more before a killer kills somebody. After twenty years the next of kin of the victim became an FBI agent and she captures the killer.The love story:In the three books she's (like that yore song) Torn Between Two Lovers.So if you already read one of the prequels you don't have to read this book because is exactly the same. Or if this is your first one you'll enjoy it but you don't have to read the other two.
5,Love this author,I absolutely love the way this author keeps you riveted until the very last page. I can't get enough of her.
3,"Not bad, other than being incomplete.","<Sigh>. Another long, drawn-out series of books that do not, individually, tell stories but that require reading the entire, 9-book series in order to get any closure. What can I say? The story here, such as it is, is pretty well told, as is normal for Vornholt. He handles the characters well, has good pacing, good action, all of that. But the ending leaves us thoroughly unsatisfied; it's going to be necessary to wade through the entire series to get any feeling of completion.If you like this sort of thing, and enjoy ongoing storylines that drag on forever, this is for you. If, like me, you hate it, then don't start. Unless, like me, you're a Star Trek junkie and just HAVE to read every Star Trek book."
4,a time to be born,"i thought this book and a time to die were much better than a time to sow and a time to harvest. i almost didnt want to read the rest of a time to sow it was so bad. vornholt did a good job of showing that picard is human, that he does have flaws and vulnerabilities."
4,a decent book,"the rashanar battle sight was one of the most fierces sights in the donminion war. it is also a big mystery. it is a graveyard of ships from both sides that all went on fighting until they had no more weapons. since no one lived to tell about it, it is a big enigma. the enterprise is assinged to the area to collect bodies and to keep scalpers away from the ships. easier said then done. the battle sight holds many mysteries as to how so many ships lost in this battle and if the enterprise is not careful, they can end up in the same shape.for all you star trek fans, this book starts out very slow, building up to a spectacular ending. don't let the first part deter you from finishing or you will be disappointed. it also brings back a dear friend that i am also glad they introduced. happy reading"
4,Review for Star trek A Time to Be Born,"Overall this book was great. I loved the character interation. The story was ok. My only problems werethe three admirals: Ross, Paris and Niqimoria. I could see Ross and Nick going after Picard because both have political agendas, Ross worked with Section 31 in Ds9 Season 7 and Nick is predugest aganist Data, I could not however see Paris going after Picard a decorated Starfleet vet. Paris from what we saw in Voyager was a fair and just man. I just couldn't see him looking for a scape goat. One other problem is why is Ross incharge of Nechyev who is off higher rank and been in Starfleet longer, those are my only problems."
1,Quality of eBook is lacking,"Returned eBook due to faulty formatting: each italicized word - and one tends to be every page or so - leaves the rest of the paragraph italicized.Amazon says they can't ""troubleshoot"" with me due to having returned it.Sarcasm: Great introduction to a series of books.Willing to update if formatting is fixed."
2,If only the writing were as good as the plot....,"I made the mistake of ordering seven of the series at once, and I can't even make it through the first book! Vornholt obviously has no idea who these characters are and how they interacted with each other on the show. It's irritating when someone tries to write characters they know nothing about. If you don't watch much TNG or don't care about dialogue, the plot will keep you reading, but I can't get over how bad the writing is, so I'm done with this author."
1,"""Familiar"" Characters?","This novel, while containing a good premise, suffers deplorably from one of Vornholt's most noted issues: familiarity with established characters and poor writing.Readers familiar with the characters of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" may find themselves wondering, based on the dialogue and actions of his characters, if Vornholt has ever actually seen the characters in action on a television screen. The two simply do not match.Added to this is an excessivly florid writing style that attempts to describe but ultimately annoys, and a failure to understand that using the word ""said"" is actually okay.The sum total of the novel, despite the interesting premise, is not enough to make it a worthy read unless you really haven't got anything else to read at all."
3,Intriguing Plot Marred By Poor Writing,"John Vornholt has been among the most consistent writers of good Star Trek fiction, but alas he falls a bit short in ""Star Trek: A Time To Be Born"". This book will appeal only to those diehard Star Trek fans who are interested in finding out what happened to Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the USS Enterprise after the film ""Star Trek: Insurrection"". Vornholt presents a very intriguing premise in his depiction of the Rashanar Sector's interstellar graveyard of warships left over from the epic Battle of Rashanar during the Dominion War. However, it is a premise marred frequently by poor writing and inconsistent plotting. At best this was an inexpensive, mildly entertaining read."
2,Not Good,"I'm sorry, but this book is, simply put, not good. The writing level is extremely elementary and the dialogue is robotic and completely unrealistic. The plot line contained potential that was never explored and the entire time the story spends in Rashanar is a garbled mess of ridiculous occurrences. I rarely give books less than three stars but I was very disappointed with A Time to be Born. The only reason why I spent time finishing it was because I had paid for it and continued to hope that it would get better. It didn't. I have been a Star Trek fanatic since I was 5 and this ranks as my least favorite Star Trek book I have read."
1,I'd rather watch Zoobully Zoo than be like her!,"Hello, my name is Alexandrea Marie Anna Bunitorisua and i am reviewing ""Sailor Uranus"". I think that Sailor Uranus Doll is very ugly and wrong. What are toys trying to teach children these days?!? That it is fine to graduate schools? Girls should stay home and help their mothers until they are four teen, and then they get married and have children at fifteen. These dolls are very bad for young girls because they make it seem like girls can particapate in sports, which they cannot. That is my opinion and i hope you follow by it. its true. THE SAILOR SCOUTS SHOULD BE BOYS...NOT WHIMPY WHINY WUSSY WEAK GIRLY GIRLS!"
3,Jewelry boxes,Very small & cheaply made. They didn't meet my expectations of how they appeared in the photo. They were just ok
5,Music Box,"This was a gift for my granddaughter's 11th birthdy. She loved it and all the drawers that were in it.I got it very quickly and I would order from, amazon again."
4,Very durable,My granddaughter is a ballerina lover and loved this Music Box. The little drawers are handy for the small earrings she has and looks great on her dresser.
4,perfect treasure box for a little girl,This product was exactly what I wanted for my granddaughter. It will be a gift for h er birthday and all she can talk about is a jewelry box with a ballerina on it. Perfect!
1,Not as shown,My grand-daughter is into purple and this picture shows a color of purple. Not true it is as pink as pink is. goods cute like she would like if color was right. delivery was very good. Says i can't get money back so if I do that will be great if not then i will not purchase toys again.
3,She loves it but....,Got this for my wife who had one as a child but it was destroyed and I thought it would be nice to get her one. She ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT but I take issue with the size.It can sit in the palm of my hand. It's about the size of those boxes used to store 3x5 recipe cards maybe a wee bit bigger but that's it and it's made of pressed cardboard so it's fragile and will warp/fall apart if it gets wet.My mother has one from when she was a kid and it's the size of a small/medium cookie tray. Guess they just don't make them like they used to.
3,enchanting!,"I purchased the ballerina jewelry box for my granddaughters, and they were entranced and delighted to see the little ballerina spin to the tune of the music. It is constructed of heavy paperboard, and will probably not hold up as well as if it were constructed of wood. This ""toy"" is not one that is meant to be played with in the traditional sense of the word play, but is to be enjoyed for the lovely artwork and the sweet music it plays."
2,Expected just a little quality...,"I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter. My initial impression was it was just covered cardbord. It looked and felt cheap. By the time I paid tax and shipping it was anything but cheap.Almost didn't give it to her and was going to send it back. However, she saw it in the bag and wanted it. She seem to like it, however, I didn't."
3,"Beautiful, but it breaks","I SO want to give a four or five star review for this little ballerina box. It's gorgeous! The cunning little drawers! The sweet, soft ballerina paintings! It plays Swan Lake! But, oops, it DID play Swan Lake. The wind up mechanism broke after only a few days, and now the ballerina does not twirl and the pretty box is silent. My little girl still likes it, and maybe this is just the way of ballerina boxes, but I wish it were more durable."
2,omega scratch box wide,THIS SCRATCH BOX IS CHEAP QUALITY. THE CARDBOARD MICE GET IN THE WAY OF THE CAT TRYING TO SCRATCH. IT IS SMALL EVEN THOUGH IT STATES WIDE. MY CATS STILL SCRATCH ON IT BUT IT IS CHEASY. THE WALMART BOX IS MUCH BETTER QUALITY FOR AROUND THE SAME PRICE.
4,better than most,"For a basic scratch board this is good. It's wider than the ones you get at Walmart type stores, and lasts a lot longer. I always reverse sides on these things so they last longer anyway but this is much better than comparable ones for a dollar or two more."
4,5 Stars for the show and -1 star for the DVD = 4 Stars!,"This is a very great show. I must say this is the only gundam series that I have ever liked. at first glance, the show may seem kiddy and cheesey but after 5 min. i guarantee it'll get u hooked. this has anime style fighting with dbz type humor. I especially like the dialog between the characters. i especially like the story line of Zero the winged knight. I can't wait for season two.My only complaint is that this DVD only contains like 2-3 episodes. Seriously a DVD can hold a lot more than 75min, considering the amount of infomation a regular movie have hold, this is seriously not worth the money."
4,Great for the beginner,"This book covers the basic aspects of loudspeaker design in an easy to understand language and includes useful software on the CD-ROM. If you want to build your own speaker system, this is the book for you. Don't expect it, however, to go further in mathematical or theoretical contents."
2,very reduced volume !!!!!,"This book is a poor example of the first David Weems book which is far superior in content,mathematics, projects, and experimental projects,how to test drivers using Oscopes audio generators,omni directional speakers,appendix useful formulas,12 db per octive crossovers,transmission lines, it even has a EQ design for bass reproduction, so if you can find the first David Weems book 336 pages of one of the best books ever written on speaker building!! And if you think things have changed since then, they have! better drivers for less, but you cannot change the laws of physics all of the info in the first edition is still very relevent!!!!!RickElectronics Tech, I have been building and designing speaker systems since 1978........"
3,If you're looking for small cabinets this is your book,"Basically I experienced an expectatives problem. I was looking for a general coverage book and this came out to be a small cabinets one. If this is what you're looking for this is an excelent book, covering from A to Z. If you're looking for folded horns or large subwoofers, keep on trying."
5,Excellent organization and presentation of material,"The author's present the material i na graphical, logical way. I wish all writers of textbooks and reference materials would present information the same way. A concept map of the entire topic and then concept maps for each of the main topics / chapters"
5,Perfect for understanding how people learn to read,I purchased this book for a graduate course I took last year. It is now an important part of my professional library. O'Donnell and Wood cover everything from the whole language v. phonics approach to creating your own assessments.
1,Fell apart just sitting on my counter,"I bought this Bamboo Steamer because of the Fox Run brand. Other items that I've used made by that company have always been satisfactory. This was purchased Jan 9, 2013 and sat on my counter unpacked but unused. Today I picked up the top tray and the bottom just fell apart. Did not use it one time and the time limit for returning expired Feb 9. Any ideas for a bamboo steamer with a broken tray bottom? You sure can't cook in it."
3,Not a fan of the flavor,"I thought mint flavor would be refreshing, but I don't like it at all. It's very difficult for me to drink water with this mixed in! This is just a personal preference, but the product didn't work for me, as someone who is trying to start taking chlorophyll."
5,The recipes taste just like Mom's home cooking,"The recipes are authentic. The tastes are great and the recipes are generally easy to follow. If I wanted to be critical, I'd say I don't need the basic cooking techniques nor the ingredient descriptions. But being Cantonese (born is the US) I've been around Cantonese cooking all my life. So I can understand these chapters are important to those not born into a Cantonese family. I just bought my third copy recently. My first one was given to me in the 70's which disappeared. I bought a second one and again it disappeared... I think members in my family must have been ""borrowing"" mine... So, now I'm on my 3rd one..."
2,2 year warranty,"Bought this item from a reputable dealer online just for the 2 year warranty that came with it. I was sick and tired of always having to replace an underwater light every 3 months. Well this one did not work as well as I thought it would. Not even 4 months into usage,the light no longer works. I don't know if the light just burned out or the outdoor transformer just blew out. The transformer is protected from the sun and rain and wind as I built an outdoor cover just to protect it from the elements. Just waiting now to see if Alpine lives up to it's guarentee. If not I' will be contacting the Better Business Bureau.Alpine did replace the entire light.It was not the bulb that burnt out,The inside of the light was all corroded from wetness,unable to fix and received a new one within 2 days.As long as you save your receipt when you purchase these lights, they DO stand behind them. KUDO'S go out to Alpine."
4,Ephesians: Pattern for Christian Living,"I purchased the book for a gift to give to an English teacher. The author used a lot of English grammar terms to explain the book of Ephesians. My friend is a Christian, so I thought she would enjoy the material. She and I both thought the book could be used for teaching purposes. The book did have some underlining in it, but was in good condition. I am glad there is a source to find older out of print books."
1,bad fit,They are gigantic even when I ordered my regular boot size. I like the style but they are so stiff just couldn't keep them.
4,Motorbike boots,"I received the boots in great time and in good order. They are a bit long and wide for me, but hubby says to wear thick socks. So all good otherwise."
3,In dry climate the banana leaves are cracking,"I absolutely love the other one we have, but this one the leaves are cracking after 6 months. I can't really keep it around humidity because a) we live in Colorado but b) it contains photos which don't fare well in humidity. I would recommend selecting one that has fewer leaves; even though they are beautiful."
5,Simply The Best,"I had been searching for two years for a great handmade photo/scrapbook album. I have had great luck purchasing from Amazon and decided to give them a try. I discovered Cozee World and were impressed with the photos of there merchandise. I decided to try them and bought two beautiful handmade albums that exceeded my expectations in beauty, design originality and quality of workmanship."
2,Natural pretty but might have mold problem,"I bought 4 albums with different designs, but will return one today. They are pretty unique and natural. However, this one has a ""mold"" problem. There are black molds on the cover especialy on the spine of the album. I guess without proper drying process, the leaves used on the album are easy to get molds later on. But I still keep the other three, because they look fine."
4,"Beautiful Album, Minor Flaws","The album is beautiful and unique. My only complaint is that some of the picture didn't fit in the slots properly. Otherwise, it was the perfect photo album to capture my travel memories."
5,Great glasses!,"These glasses look good, are built well, block out the sun, and carry an extremely affordable price! Not to mention that they are pretty darn comfortable! Look and feel great without spending $100+."
5,Great quality and good looking!,"I'm just about to buy a pair myself. I've read into them and the quality is definitely there, and the value is incredible. The US army, navy, and military has all used these sunglasses. Plus it doesn't hurt that Don Draper in Mad Men has been sporting them as well!- Brennan[...]"
5,I love this book. I love this series. It's unique.,"I read this book at age 9. I loved it. I loved reading about Ashleigh, and Charlie, and Len, the Townsends, and later Sammy. I am now 14. I still love the book. There is nothing like this series. I love Wonder, and I still do. I knew she was special from the start. I also love the way she didn't just give the foal a bottle, and now she's winning the Derby. No, she had her trials and tribulations. Overall, this book is one in a million, and it deserve 1,010! I reccomend it to everyone."
2,What is everyone talking about??,"Wonder was a good filly, but the jerk Brad, messed up her radical carrer. But it wasn't like the authors were going to let her win the Triple Crown, none of the Whitebrook, Townsend Acres or Edgardale horses were good enough for that even though they tried to make it sound like it. Face it guys, why did they say those great things about the above farms if none of the horses won anything but the Classic and Kentucky Derby? Think about it. Joanna Campbell is fooling everyone of us. (Until I caught on)"
1,NOT so Good,"Really, there isn't enough details in this boook. I love the thoroughbred series, but this noe is NOT GOOD!"
5,Awsome Book,When I saw this book from the cover I didn't think I would like it. That just goes to show you don't judge a book by it's cover! This book is about a beautiful little filly and a nice girl who love eachother dearly. Please by it and you will get attached and keep reading. These are the best books!!!!!!
5,a great book!,wow! what a a great book! if you love horses you deffinently read it. it is deffinetly the best throughbred book ever! i recomend it!
5,The best Thoroughbred ever,"A Horse Called Wonder is in my opinion, the best Thoroughbred. It's about a girl named Ashleigh, who tries to save a sick foal from dying. After, she's sure the foal will live, she has to save the foal from being sold by the owners of the foal. If you want to start reading the series, start with this one."
5,A Horse Called Wonder is a superb book! I loved it!,"A Horse Called Wonder was one of the most touching and one of the greatest books I ever read. It was SUPER! Ashleigh is one of my many idols! Keep it up, Joanna! -Sophie P."
5,This series is absolutely the best!,"I really love the first book in th Tb series. I think Ashleigh's determination not to let the sick filly die is really moving.I also like the way Charlie is introduced. If you haven't read this series before, you'd better start right away. I want to buy the series so I'm saving my money. (Don't have enough yet)This series makes me want to move to Kentucky!"
5,perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have never read a better book. Usally I get a little bored with some books, but with this book, I was on my towes the intire time! I love her detirmination and will. Thanks for a grand book!-Jessie"
5,THE THROUGHDBRED SERIES IS SO COOL!!!!,"Who couldn't think that Ashleigh's Wonder wouldn't make it without Ash? I DID!! My favourite character was Wonder of course, she is such a sweetheart isn't she? I WOULD LOVE TO OWN A THROUGHBRED HORSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like how Wonder's high spirits kick in at the very last moment! Anyone who wants to talk horses, email me!!!!"
5,A classic read for all horse lovers.,"I read this book over and over and over again. The pages are wearing out because of it. I love it so much. I started reading the series when I was young and even though I'm 16 now, I still read the series but especially this one."
2,poor service/poor quality,I contacted the vendor right after ordering and cancelled order. They shipped anyway and made it my problem to return item. Item had fault in the stone on top of not being wanted. poor quality and poor service.
3,"Cute, but way to small.","This is a cute shirt, and the color was great, but it runs VERY small. I consistently wear a size medium, ordered this in a medium, and had to return it because of the size. I didn't try a large, because I was doubtful it would even fit."
2,weird sizing,"I thought I'd purchased this brand before. Oops. I wear a women's 14 or XL. The sleeve are three inches too long. I'm 5'8"" and have long arms. The body, laid out on a table, is the same size as a medium from last winter. Would I recommend this? Perhaps to a teenage boy, but never to a woman."
3,if it wasnt for i told the storm,"I HAVE HAD THE OPPERTUNITY TO LISTEN TO GREG O' QUIN ALBUM. IT WASNT BAD BUT I MUST SAY IT WASNT THE BOMB! BUT I TOLD THE STORM, YES, THAT SONG REALLY MINISTERS TO MY SPIRIT. I AM THE SOLOIST OF THAT SONG AT MY CHURCH AND I GET JOY EVERYTIME I SING IT. THAT SONG LETS ME KNOW THAT THERE IS PEACE AND HOPE FOR EVERY STORM THAT ARISES IN MY LIFE!!!"
4,Good CD,Gospel CDs usually are very similar taken the fact that they are in the same genre of music and this CD is not really that unique from any other gospel CD. It is a good CD now. Two songs that I particularly like are the first song I WANNA KNOW YOU and the hit I TOLD THE STORM. Now the latter song is definitely 1 of the bondage breaking songs where one can jus let loose. I recommend this CD!
5,Want Encourgement?!?,"I brought this cd when it first came out and someone stole it. I guess they need encouragement as well. But I just purchase this cd it can really speak to your heart and soul. My favorite tracks I suggest for you to listen to are Dry Your Eyes, Know You, and I Told The Storm. Purchase this cd it will change your walk in Christ."
2,I WANT THIS CD,MY NAME IS SAKEEM DAVIS I LIVED IN NEW HAVEN CT AND WHEN I HEARD THIS CD I GOT LIFT IT AND THE SONGS THAT I LIKED ON THIS ALBUM IS FOR THE LOVE OF YOU AND DRY YOUR EYES AND ROCK SO I BEGGING YOU CAN PLEASE HAVE THIS CD PLEASE CAN YOU MAIL TO 51 TAYLOR AVENUE IN NEW HAVEN CT. P.S MY NUMBER IS 389-1290
4,Excellent Cassette Case from Todd in D.C.,I found this product to be an extremely effective way to organize and carry my cassettes. I think a vinyl exterior would have been more attractive than the nylon exterior.
4,An excellent first pencil or large pencil made in the USA,"This is a wonderfully made wood pencil, with a triangular-shaped barrel. The lead core is very good and probable between an HB and B grade. Ideal size for small children as a first pencil, or for those that need to grip a larger diameter pencil. Made in the USA. Highly recommended. Good eraser as well. Compares with the Dixon 13082 Tri-Write large diameter pencil, but those are not made in the USA, if that matters to you..."
4,"""O.B.I.T."" foresees fear of electronic privacy invasion","Would you believe that ""O.B.I.T."" anticipates, 30-odd years ahead, the very contemporary paranoa of privacy invasion via... watchamacallits, whether they're ordinary personal computers... or Outer Band Individuated Teletracers, as is the case in this slick B&W Outer Limits episode?! This might now look as the real horror behind this alien-in-disguise story. Cool, snapping courtroom lines are superbly delivered, notably by Peter Breck and Jeff Corey, and beside stock shots of a plane trip, not a second seems wasted, either visually or dramatically... or sonically. Indeed, the sound effects of the terrifying, obnoxious personnel and personal spying computer (albeit with graphite knobs instead of a mouse!) are truly unsettling and perfectly edited in. If we would be living in a fun epoch, this would have been the first episode of the new Outer Limits to be remade. Too daring a subject?"
1,Made with the cheapest plastic available.,"I bought this card two months ago from amazon and yesterday the card fell apart, first the readonly button fell off leaving the card locked and useless, than the card simply fell apart in two parts, the memory is now exposed and I have no use for it anymore. its a shame because it was a fast card and holds a lot of music for my pda."
3,Informative but Unkind to Mrs. Lincoln,"I've read all I've found on Lincoln and yet I found new details about his death here that I had not read elsewhere. It doesn't rehearse the ins and outs of the conspiracy which is good if you've read ""Blood on the Moon"" and, even more so, ""American Brutus"". My cavil with 'Darkest Dawn"" is that it portrays Booth all but sympathetically and Mrs. Lincoln as the devil herself. Mary Todd Lincoln was, without doubt, a manic-depressive who was dogged by bad health and hellish luck. She was a difficult lady who nevertheless withstood considerable slander and ridicule from both North and South. However, she was a staunch abolitionist who loved her husband dearly and was a kind and devoted mother. The author has the irritating habit of referring to her consistently as the ""woman"" and even finds her breakdown immediately after the assassination as reason for criticism. I guess if she hadn't, he'd be accusing her being part of the murder plot."
5,Long and effective,This is easy to hold and long enough to reach everywhere I want. I love the sleek look and mellow color - I prefer a vibrator that looks more like a toy and less like what it's substiting for. A good choice for versatility and enjoyment!
1,Didnt like it,It looks nice on here. The plastic is hard and the noise is loud ... I didnt find it pleasurable at all.Cant get grip it very well either.Its pretty cheaply made to be honest...Im sorry I think its a waste of money.
1,Terrible!,"So I purchased this toy not sure whether or not I was going to like it. I bought it solely because I felt the price couldn't be beat. Well, I'm regretting that decision. Sure, it looks pretty and it vibrates. That's about the extent of it. Using this vibrator is kind of like trying to shower with a faucet that only drips. Sure it will work...but why bother? It's loud, awkward to hold, sounds like its rattling during use and isn't even powerful enough to use as a body massager. I don't think I'll ever use this."
3,Pretty good for the Price,"Here's the deal. If you're looking for something that will last you for a few years until you have enough money to purchase a nice dining room set, this is what you are looking for. We have had the set for over a month and haven't had too many problems with it. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to put it together. The leaf fits in very easily and extends the table to accommodate all six chairs. I have two small kids and this set is holding well after much climbing on the table and jumping off of the chairs :) I researched many tables at low cost places and found this to be the best buy. The only issue I've had so far is with the wood pieces that cover over the screws in the chairs. Almost all of them have fallen out of the holes, but that is small in comparison to the overall construction of the chair. I am pretty satisfied, but can see that we'll probably be replacing it in five years or so since that is how long our previous ""cheap"" table lasted our family."
2,Incomplete set,"I am not sure on what to say about the table/chairs. The table is fine, and so are 5 of the chairs, however one of the barrel nuts of the 6th chair was defective. I repeatedly tried to get Amazon to help me, but I was told I'm on my own. I was told to contact the manufacturer (it didn't even say on the instructions who manufactured it, let alone a phone number/email address). So now i have a great table, plus 5 chairs, but I paid for 6!!! The other recommendation amazon gave me was to find it at a hardware store, but those are very specific items, that no hardware store carries. Thanks a lot!!!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"The stories are continuous on these CDs - you cannot skip from one fairy tale to the next. When you push the skip button, it just fast forwards. Every time you play the CD, it starts at the beginning. So, to get to a different story, you have to keep searching and searching. Very difficult to find the beginning of the fairy tales. Much more trouble than it's worth!!!"
3,Love the stories but be forewarned!,"These stories are the real tales as written by the original authors so there is some ""chopping off of heads"" and witchcraft and whatnot. You will want to listen to them before deciding whether or not to share them with your children. I will say that my six year old son loves them and listens to the CDs repeatedly (and he's a smart, normal boy). The worst part is that the stories don't break so you have to start at the first story each time you pop a CD in. There's no skipping ahead unless you do a manual forward. That's no fun but kids don't seem to mind that as much as we adults do."
2,A little graphic for my taste,These are the original tales so it has a lot of death and to me graphic detail that our generation is not accustomed too. After about 5 stories I had to turn it off. I did not want my kids who are around 4 to hear any more without me going through the rest of the tales myself first.
5,Great Companion Book,"After reading the Apple pro training series:Shake 3 traing book, it left me with a lot of un answered questions about what each individual control does in shake 3. This handbook fills in those gaps. Now I feel I know how to use shake more than ever. Detailed pictures, brief hints and tips, and thorough explainations of each node and control are what this book covers. I highly recomend this book for anybody who has already gone through the shake 3 traing book by peachpit press."
3,"USFL Lives on, sort of...Doug F. book by Barbara Siegel from back in Doug's N.J. Generals days",USFL redux! Doug book from WAAYYYY BACKwhich is now a collector's item. Pickup on it!
5,Almost as fabulous as the concert,"I saw the concert in Seattle this summer and it was one of the top 5 concerts I have ever seen. This CD is a faithful representation of the sound, and almost captures some of the live energy, although nothing quite compares with a live version of ""Church!"" I only wish the CD had ""Pontiac"" on it -- I was moved to tears in the concert, and the audience was dead silent for each and every crisp note. Otherwise, a perfect album, and one of my favorites of the year."
3,Recording way too bright!,"I love the performance itself. The addition of Rickie Lee Jones and the Cello solo are wonderful, but this is by far the ""brightest"" live recording that I own. I much prefer the tonal balance on his studio made recordings. On my system, if I have the volume level set to where I get any decent mid range, my head will get cut right off from the highs. I also agree with comments about this album not adding much over the other albums if you already own them."
5,Lovett makes the top grade once again,"Lyle Lovett's done it again. He has made me run out and purchase an album. I would rank this up there with the likes of Dylan, Neil Young and Springsteen. True American Classics."
4,Terrific live album of Lovett favorites,"Most live albums come out for two or three reasons. Usually the artist wants to 1) make money on his or her old songs now that they've made it big ; 2)To capture the unique sound of a particular tour and provide a souvenir for the fans; 3)or provide a sense of closure to some portion of the an artist's career.Unfortunately, most live albums are just plain disappointing. A lot of musicians overdub the performances (the two Eagles live albums) or fail to live up to the expectations generated by their studio albums. Lyle Lovett is an exception to all of these situations. His album, Live In Texas, is a terrific representation of his energetic band. Mixing a dash of R&B, rock, country, swing, gospel and big band to produce a sound uniquely his own. Although this fine album doesn't have any tracks from his last two albums, it provides a very good summation of where Lyle's been and where he's headed to. Thanks for taking us along for the ride!Wayne Klein"
5,"Amazing, Versitile","I was dragged into listening to Live in Texas by a co-worker. I had never bothered to actually listen to any of Lyle Lovett's work. I regret that it took me so long.Lovett's aim, it seems, is to drop all pretense and just have a lot of fun by making good music, even while pushing the envelope with almost punishing craftsmanship. He must go through endless rehearsal to make that Large Band work like a well-oiled machine. There is not a single weak track on the album.I defy anyone to find a passage that isn't tight, clean, and beautifully arranged and voiced. Outstanding work. It is also a measure of Lovett's immense respect for the music and the musicians that his picture on the cover is no larger than anyone else's, and that he lets other artists (like vocalist Francine Reed and cellist John Hagen) shine through with some brilliant solo work.Live in Texas is class act, and worth owning."
4,"fresh, not stagnant or cooky-cutter nashville sounding","This record is refreshing. It does not sound just like every other country artist's project out there today being exploited by the industry that really does not know anything about true country music roots... Lyle has a distinctive sound... Every time you here him, you know it's Lyle... The songs talk about real stories.. although cute, they have a positive message that makes sense.. Plus, He shows some Texas swing roots.. I like it. Chip Bricker, Producer, Rite Records"
2,This is Not the Original Book by this author.,"This is Not the Original book writen by the author. One should purchase Volume 1 in the Saint Germain Series to get the Original ""Unveiled Mysteries"" which does make a difference since it is charged with Light from Beloved Saint Germain. It will cost more but is priceless in its value. Also, this one has been changed from what the author originaly wrote. That can make a very big difference!!!"
5,A true gift - like finding gold,"I fortunately stumbled upon this book (Unveiled Mysteries) and have been so amazed at its depth and wisdom that I've ordered the next two volumes. I've long had a passing interest in St. Germain and now realize that his teachings are pure gold. I only wish they had resonated with me a bit earlier. Godfré Ray King, the author of the first three books, has done a great service to humanity. Read this book and be prepared to embark on a fantastic journey."
2,The Mysteries of Life,"'Unveiled Mysteries' is an easy read, however it needs to be read slowly and with contemplation in order to avoid psychic indigestion or to get any value from its concealed information. Some profound truths for those looking for them and an alternative view of the world; reading makes more sense to those who have had some training. A 'New Age' book before it became a popular modern day movement.There is some reliance on old stories of a fabulous Utopia called 'Atlantis' and a bit of propaganda for the USA as a future Utopia!! G.R. King is the pen name of a channeller before channellers,; G.W. Ballard is his name and he gives voice to the teachings of the 'Ascended Master' Comte Saint Germain. There is much information on the NET. Key in 'Godfre Ray King' or 'Ascended Master'."
5,Love it!,I got the LAST one on amazon and i couldnt believe he was 75.00 :o but i love him he is by far the best breyer i have and i have a lot i hope you enjoy him as much as me :)
2,East and West by Gerald Green,"I am halfway through the subject book (Gerald Green's ""East and West""). I have found several historical discrepancies and I'm wondering how many there are that I don't know about. 1. Mr. Green refered to Camp Pendleton, twice in the timeframe of 1941. The US governement did not buy the land for Camp Pendleton until March of 1942. 2. He refers to Japan's Imperial Marines. Japan did not have marines. They had a Special Naval Landing force often called marines by US troops, but that is not what they were. 3. He refers to a Japanese major's rank insignia as ""leaves"". This one I'll have to look up, but I don't believe Japan used the same type of rank insignia as the US. Has anyone else complained about authors blowing it like this ? I think it casts doubt on the credibility of his work. Can you comment as well ? Thank You, Lee Rash"
5,Donnatello Upright Vacuum,Purchased this vacuum because I didn't need a large vacuum. Needed something for wood floors. This does the job. Also liked the hepa filter. Very well made. Am very happy with this item. I am ordering the extension hose to clean baseboards and ceilings. Love this product. The only problem that I had was the shipping from Amazon took much longer than expected.
3,Rose Stripe Sheets,"I love the color ,its just what I wanted. When I got them I was thrilled. They were this beautiful color with a subtle sheen. When I washed them the sheen was gone and they were totally wrinkled. They are great after ironing but I don't want to iron my sheets so I would not order these again."
2,LAME!,dont buy this figure! he is little and flimsy and his face looks alful! the paint on his face chips off! so his face looks bule! his rubber arms are too big for the figure! because the figure is so skinny and alful! DO NOT BUY FIGURE!!!!!!!
1,PIECE OF JUNK - DITTO,I did not buy this product from Amazon but do want to relate our experience. It was 4 months of a nightmare with software that ultimately corrupted the win95 operating system. The tech support people do not have a clue--part of the problems were generated by the tech support staff; I got 4 different solutions to the same problem [none of them worked]. I will never ever buy a Microtek product of any sort based on this experience. I urge others to boycott this company. I am amazed that they get good product reviews; the only thing I can figure out is that the people doing the product reviews are techies and can fix the problems as they happen. If you are not a techie do not even consider this product--you are on your own when you buy it regardless of their support claims.
5,The best scanner for that money!,"You can't find a better 36 bit scanner for that money. And you can't find a scanner with 1200 dpi physical resolution in this class. If you are going to spend nothing more than 200 bucks, this is the one."
1,A LEMON FOR SURE,"I have had the same software problems as the other reviewers, and have had a terrible time with this scanner. Also, like the other reviewers, I consider the scan quality of this scanner to be excellent but unfortunatly I am seldom able to make it work. The software is for win 95 but did not work properly even with that version of windows, and with Windows 98, its almost out of the question, though I have been able to use it a few times. (hehe) I think that if 13 out of 13 reviews say theres software problems, that as a minimum its time for the buyer to beware, and perhaps even time for a refund or exchange from Microtek."
5,Review of Money and Ciggarettes CD,My wife heard the song on the commercial for the new Eric Clapton phone and wanted it. So we order this CD that has it.The whole CD is pretty good and the price and service from this seller was great.
3,Not for the bargain bins,"I was first turned onto this album when I was just getting into music (around 1986). I bought it on cassette from a cut-out bin at some department store for about 2 bucks. It was my first experience with Clapton. I enjoyed it then and now owning more than 20 Clapton C.D's, I still find myself listening to it quite often. Is it his best? No, but it still has a simple quality that I enjoy quite a bit."
3,hernan de argentini,"el disco lo compre nuevoy llego rapidicimo ,bien embalado,lastima que el vendedor no aclaro en ningun momento que el lp era nuna version remasterizada.a mi particularmente no me gustan"
3,Commercial Clapton,Probably one of his worst albums. I bought it when it first came out and it was really aimed at the bubblegum set and not the true Clapton fan. It did give him a top 10 hit though and that was the only good thing coming off the album.
3,Too laid back for me,"What you have here is Claptons' first release on Duck Records, which is a division of Reprise. It is his first album without Robert Stigwood.The songs on here are rockers, but in my mind dont have the drive like Layla or some other songs he has done. There is alot of Rockabilly guitar with some good guitar licks.What is absent are the blues songs we have become to know and love. This CD is more the Rock side of Eric Clapton.This is not one of his better efforts, but not one of his worst either.The songs on this CD worth mentioning are Everybody Oughta Make A Change, Rock and Roll Heart and the very pretty love ballad Pretty Girl. Pretty girl is one of his better ballads of his career. This CD is primarily for collectors like myself."
5,The terror Timeline,Item arrived quickly and in great condition. My husband is enjoying reading it. Thank you.
2,A thorough piece of disinformation,"A thorough piece of disinformation, not in that any of the facts it presents are not true, but through its selection and arrangement of facts. Excessive space is spent on the Pakistani ISI and the Arab patsies and their movements prior to 9/11, which all directs the reader away from the brains behind the drone attacks and subesequent demolitions, Dov Zakheim and Bibi Netanyahu respectively. A genuine terror timeline would have devoted several chapters to these two gentlemen alone."
5,Interested in 9/11??,If you're at all interested in a chronological review of 9/11 then this is the book to read. I would consider this to be the 9/11 bible. Very well written and easy to read. I highly recommend this book.
4,Wise investment,"Excellent reference book. Thoroughly researched and well organized. Invaluable source of information for anyone who is seriously interested in objectively investigating what happened on September 11, 2001."
2,What a pity,"Well, I am satisfied with the sound, the handling, and the quality of speed and shipping. But the quality of the workmanship is low. The pick-up should be glued between the guitars body and the strings, the p/u is flat enough to fit between those things to work, but who controlled the quality before selling it? Someone brazed it and did not mention to put the wire into the p/u. The result is that the p/u is a bit to thick to proceed as planned. Finally I tried to adjust it by an electrician who melted the whole thing into something different ....."
4,"""BLUE WONDER POWER MILK"" DOES THE BODY GOOD!!!","I really enjoyed Hooverphonics ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular""--but ""Blue Wonder Power Milk"" kinda left me wanting just a little bit more. That's not to say that this baby isn't amazing, mind you, because songs like Renaissance Affair, Dictionary, Lung, Club Monterpulciano, Battersea, This Strange Effect and Tuna, and the use of classical string arrangements throughout make the CD quite listenable. It's too bad that Hooverphonic this go-round almost sounds ""poppish,"" but B.W.P.M. is still a classic, and a darn good album for chillin' and fulfillin'! (yeah--I know--very corney!)"
4,did I ever think of you as my best friend...,it took me a while to get into it..a little while..the song EDEN is just beautifull and moving..can't wait for their third album next month..
2,Eh...,"bought it for the VW commercial song ""renaissance affair"" (which is a *great* song). but if that's what you're looking for, you may be in for a bit of a disappointment. the only other song that really lives up to the promise is track 1.the rest is a meandering mish-mash of ideas that don't really strike any particular chord with me and aren't very memorable (i.e. no hooks).but those two tracks are almost worth the price of admission."
1,What in damnation?,"This cd is BAD. I only bought it because I liked the previous one (A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular) and because some misguided listeners decided to rave about it on this site. Anywho, buy olive, buy bjork, but stay away from this messy drivel."
1,Poor Follow-Up,"I really liked Hooverphonic's first album. In fact, I listened to it incessantly when I first got it. This second album nearly put me to sleep. I believe there were a couple of moments that worked, but overall it was the same tired old thing. I don't recommend it."
1,Why?,"I love trip-hop and especially stuff that has a Bjork-like edge to it, and so I was figuring this would have been a good listen. But no, I could barely go through listen the first song. The lyrics were horrible in my mind, just pure schmaltz that doesn't deserve to classified alongside Portishead and Massive Attack. I'm just glad that I got it used."
3,Hooverphonic - Blue Wonder Powder Milk,"If I were able to, I'd give this ablum 3 1/2 stars. Not as good as ""A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular"" but still good. Standout tracks are ""Battersea"", ""Club Montepulciano"", and ""Tuna"". Recommended if you like mellow music. If like this you might like artists like Lamb, Moloko, Gus Gus and Everything But the girl. This disc is worth your time."
3,"Good, but falls short from precedent set by the first","If you really liked the first CD, the second falls short of producing a collection bent on a new sound. The first explored more boundaries than the second. By this comparison, the sounds produced in the 2nd album are not as impressive as the first."
3,Hmmmmmmmm...,"I bought this album because I heard it was more of a poppy sound then their previous album. I like ""trip-pop"" with eltronic noises worked in like Olive, and after listening to a sample of ""Club Montepulciano"", I wanted this CD. It's good, and at times it's very pretty, but, it's too haunting. I mean, I'm all for that haunting vibe like Garbage's ""You Look So Fine"", but, not again and again. I would've prefered more songs like ""Club M"". Besides that track, nothing is really catchy here. I think that's an important factor in a song no matter what style it is. It's just an important part of song crafting, or else things get boring. ""Magenta"" & ""Eden"" are really the only other memorable songs. It's unique, but, I think I'll stick to bands like Garbage & Olive for my haunting & trip-pop flair."
4,Great CD,"I had never heard of this band until a few months ago, when 2 of this album's tunes were featured on the tv show ""La Femme Nikita."" Now I am so glad I bought this CD! ""Eden"" and ""This Strange Effect"" are both great songs, but so is the rest of the album, especially ""Club Montepuciano"" and ""Magenta,"" just to name a few. Every time I play this CD I find that there is something else I like about it. A lot of people won't buy CDs from non-mainstream bands because they are afraid that they won't like the entire album. I used to be guilty of that myself! I am so glad to finally get tuned in to some great music and found out what I have been missing all these years. Take my word for it--you will love this one."
5,Stunning symphonic soundscapes of trip-pop,"This disc is considerably more instrumentally lush than Hooverphonic's previous album. The tracks alternate between electronic grooves and powerful melodies backed with horns and strings. Some songs still feature the sparse, trip-hop beats of the first disc, but this album adds the drive and energy of drum-and-bass to several songs. Geike (new vocalist) does a great job, giving a performance I would classify as ""hypnotic."" Don't buy this if you're looking for straight trip-hop, because it's not--Hooverphonic has progressed to the next level."
2,Let Down,Something happened to Hooverphonic after their first album A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular which I listen to constantly. I don't mean the new lead singer who is very capable but in the way the music was produced. It lacks all the subtlities of the previous album. It almost sounds like a new group. There is no flow to this collection of music. Besides Renaissance Affair the rest have no feeling. Wait for their next album. Disappointed.
5,"Trippy beats, searing vocals, and heavy orchestration.","In succumbing to this album, prepare to bend. Blue Wonder Power Milk plays like a dreamscape. Imagine yourself, blindfolded, being led through a dark garden by a spirit. It takes hold of your hand and leads you past water, people, night. You can barely sense the blues and greens of your surroundings, yet you know they encompass you on all sides. Then, like swimming deep in water, you let yourself rise through them, your back bent in submission. This is what Blue Wonder Power Milk gives you: A theme to explore. The spirit that leads you is Geike's voice, the surroundings you push through are the deep surgings of the Hooverphonic Orchestra, while trippy beats surge behind and beneath you, like oxygen, propelling you up and through."
2,Disappointing and weak,"This is the first CD I bought relying on the rating and ""the customers who bought this CD also bought ...."" list. I must also admit that I had liked 2Wicky in Stealing Beauty soundtrack as well. So I decided to buy this album to hear some strong atmospheric trip-hop. Unfortunately, it doesnt meet my expectations. Why should someone listen to Hooverphonic while they have the chance to listen to Portishead, Morcheeba, Lamb etc. ? The first song ""Battersea"" is the best effort in the CD, the rest doesnt work well. This CD is worth 1 star, but I like their name, I give an extra star for that!"
2,Broken Glamalina Doll,"The Glamalina is a beautiful doll but she was broken right out of the box.There is a cheesey rubber band attaching the legs together and to the doll which was already broken when we took her out of the box. It was heartbreaking trying to fix her so my 6 yr old could play with her. Alas! There was no fixing her and she remains broken in the box. She is adorable and I love her wardrobe but she is fragile. The hairpiece idea is brilliant,they should market the hairpieces for little curly-haired girls like my daughter-she loves having ""long hair""."
3,left handed calligraphy,"I bought this book and another one at a famous bookstore for calligraphy, (John Neal bookstore), since I became left handed after a stroke. The one bought at John Neal store(title: Insight into left handed calligraphy)contained more informations for left handed, but at the end every left handed has to find their own way to learn and practice calligraphy, the title offered at Amazon did not help in the beginning, may be at a later date when my skills improve with practice."
2,disappointed,the print was so small on most of the pages you couldn't even read it. not good. i wouldn't recommend it.
1,No help at all,What I wanted was a book that would have script styles suitable for a left-hander. Right-handed styles come out all wrong if they are done by a leftie as the broad and narrow strokes are all reversed. Money wasted.
3,"Nice table, but tipsy","Bought this for camping in our RV. Unless we're lucky enough to be parked on a concrete slab, it's very tipsy so we don't use it as often as we'd like. But on concrete, it's great."
1,Flimsy and worthless,"I read a few nice reviews of this table, and figured the aluminum would be a good surface for camping (no burn or melt & easy to clean). I unpacked and set it up. It was easy enough to figure out, but it did take a few minutes longer than I would have expected. But once set up (and set up properly mind you!), it is worthless. The table is so light, any breeze or sneeze would send it flying. It is so unsteady and floppy, I can't imagine placing anythying with weight or value upon it. I packed it back up and returned it without ever taking it out of the living room. I'll look for something else - maybe the wood/vinyl one from Orion"
1,No point,"I never had any thing like this before, so decided to get one ""personal massager"" for myself. Really there was no point in this for me. I just threw it in my sock drawer where it remains."
3,"Ok, but doesn't get the job done.","Pro-uses AA batteries, doesn't look like your traditional vibe, small and easy to conceal.Con-not very powerful, wasn't enough to get the job done.Overall-good warm-up device, would like it to be more powerful."
2,Axioms of Separation. By John E. Ashbrook,This turned out to be a very small booklet. It was also outdated in it's approach.I would not recommend this to anyone. It was extremely highly priced for what it was.
2,Best for beginning research,"Having spent the last two years researching my ancestors, I found this book a disappointment. It told little that I didn't know and actually didn't confirm some of what I did know. Now, I need to buy all the smaller volumes to see what they might contain? No thank you. I think I shall see if a library can find them. So, if you are starting your research, this is a great place to start but don't get too excited. It is a rather limited book."
4,Code Lyoko maniac,"I have a VERY active and action oriented 6 year old. He has the cube that shoots things, Odd with his board, Ulrich with his transformer, and Ulrich with his unicycle. Odd's tail did come off but I put it right back on and it has stayed on. Nothing else has fallen apart and my son plays HARD with his toys. I am now on a mission to fulfil the latest request ""get some of the girls Mom!"" I would hate to see what would happen if we actually HAD Cartoonnetwork!"
1,Horrible quality,"Aelita's leg fell off as I was taking it out of the package. And it would not stay on if you as so much as picked it up. I had to use super glue so he wouldn't have a one-legged toy. My son got several Code Lyoko toys for his birthday, and most of them broken within minutes. They were gently handled by a 6-year-old and his mother. I would not recommend ANY of these toys if they have moving parts or electronics."
3,Good value,"There are a number of pretty good westerns in this five disc collection of 20 western motion pictures, however these movies have not been digitally remastered, nor has the Mono sound been converted into digital Stereo surround sound. DTS would have been nice :)The Italian western 'Any Gun Can Play' staring Gilbert Roland as 'Monetero', George Hilton as 'The Stranger' and Ed Byrnes as 'Clayton' is well done, coupled with being in 'real' (((wide-screen))) makes this 1967 picture nice viewing.The 1976 movie 'Mad Dog Morgan' begins in the 1850's Australian gold fields, quickly progressing to the Aussie prison system and expanding to the Outback. This very interesting film stars Dennis Hopper of all people, along with a fine Australian cast. The untamed Australian wilderness is used as a stunning backdrop throughout the movie. 'Mad Dog Morgan' is shown in 'full screen'.The price for this movie collection is just right!Mean Guns 20 Movie Pack"
5,unbeatable,"it's a great dill. Sound is bad, but It's an old movies and picture is ORIGINAL, what is the best. It worth to see it. There are 20 bad and good movies. I like tham ALL. So, you can do too."
4,Awesome!!!!,This is a collection of old westerns. I gave it to my son for christmas which he liked because he likes westerns. Awesome collection with some rare movies. 20 of them. Danny
3,"The Good, The Bad, and The Verrrrrry Bad","I have seen about seven of the twenty movies and I keep hoping that I will see some good ones. I made the mistake of watching ""Dead Aim"" first. I don't know if any of the others are as horrible as that one. I wanted to see the good old gun-fighting days and these movies offer that. I have observed that the really bad ones have a problem with story-plot. I am learning from all of them I've seen so far and I am excited about seeing the other thirteen. The pack came at a very good price so I am pleased with my purchase. I am rating them as I watch and I don't plan to see any one that has a rating lower than four; by the way ""Dead Aim"" is rated two stars."
3,A Disappointing Read...,"It's really hard to say anything negative about a book written by a physician who loves Christ and appears to be dedicated to serving Him and others.But after reading this book, I have to say that it is in desperate need of a good copy editor. Dr. Gills tries to talk about love and contrast it to selfishness, but the copy is often unfocused and wandering and the reader is unsure where he's headed from page to page. Strangely, all the even numbered pages just have random quotes on the subject of love, that actually distract from trying to follow the flow of the chapters. Although I'm sure his intent with the book is to glorify Christ and edify the church, his readers would be much better served by skipping this book and reading something really worthwhile on the subject likeThe Four LovesorSacred Marriage."
3,Lost Momentum!,"Greg Kihn Band was making waves with songs like ""The Break Up Song"" and ""Jeopardy"" but lost the inicial momentum with this album. The lead off song ""Reunited"" is OK but not great and ""Rock"" sounds like a re-lyriced Jeopardy.It's no wonder that this album did not get the switch over to CD.Maybe that's why the band did not survive another album & Greg went solo.Not very necessary (not even for die-hard fans) unless you are a collectionist of rare albums."
5,Absolutely awesome,"I don't even normally listen to audio tapes like these, but being a fan of Harry Truman and David McCullough, I had to get this. I do want to say that I am VERY, VERY hopeful that this comes out on CD. It is absolutely enthralling. Very fun, very educational. As has already been said - every leader should listen to this."
5,My Sister is obsessed,"I bought this for my 23 year old sister who loves platypi. I was expecting it to be a bit bigger, but this is perfect. I looks just like the picture and is very cute, It is about as big as my Chihuahua. Very fast shipping also!"
5,he loved it,I got this for a good friend of mine. He mentioned the animal platypus and I was convinced he was just making it up and being silly because I believe everything. He said NOOO I'm serious its like my favorite animal. So I looked it up and saw it was real and decided to get this for him. He loves it and named it Platy
4,Plush Platypus - A favorite with our granddaughter,"This duplicate platypus was bought as a replacement for the first one which got ""lost"" at the hospital. Our granddaughter (16) had lent her platypus to her great-grandfather while recovering. Most of the hospital staff knew ""Patrick"" and loved him. Unfortunately he disappeared one day after the sheets were changed. This platypus is very soft and exactly what our granddaughter wanted. Evidently the platypus become popular with the show Phineas & Ferb which has led many of us to learn morer about this Australian mammal. Before getting lost, ""Patrick"" had been washed a few times and survived well -- just not quite as soft as when new. BTW, PJ (Patrick Jr) now stays home and doesn't venture out except for occasional visits!"
5,For Granddaughter,Granddaughter was very happy to receive this toy at Easter with her Easter goody basket.
5,platypus,"excellent time on shipping, great toy and had no problems!! thanks so much the kids love it and it keeps them occupied for most of the day"
3,Don't fall for the reviews,"In real life, this thing isn't pretty. I guess platypi aren't necessarily pretty animals, but for a plush stuffed animal doll this thing is definitely not on the cute or pretty side. Like getting a polar bear but the real look instead of a teddy bear look. In other words, not a successful translation of the animal for kids."
2,not very big...,this thing is incredibly detailed and really cutebut its super small!18 inches sounds big...but its not!love-jonny
1,Not Received--out of stock!,"Never received this item.Out of stock. Bought w/ book. Money returned.Later in Oct. I received and charged for the book that I did not want without the Platypus animal. I bought as set, not individual items.Will not order sets again.Could have returned, but live in country--do not get to the P.O. often."
5,Great gift,"I got this plushie for my sister as a birthday gift, and she loved it. It's realistic looking, yet very charming. It would make a great addition to any plushie collection."
4,"very good, a little sloppy & boomy","Excellent subwoofer for thumping the bass. A little loose and sloppy if you're looking for good clean bass reproduction. My old Boston Acoustics A150 floor standing 3-ways went almost as low while being a lot tighter. Probably a striaght up comparison of a sealed enclosure (A150) to a ported enclosure (Athena). Still, I like it and it was a helluva deal..."
3,,"We bought this receiver since it was recommended we get a down firing sub woofer. I looked everywhere and found this. I read the fair reviews and purchased it. We attached it to our Sony DG800 receiver. It works well when the setting is currently on 3. I do not recommend going over 4 since it is not sturdy enough and will shake. Overall, it's a good product."
5,"jeff ""electronics junkie""",Oh yes this subwoofer is gooooood. The guy who wrote that he only had it on 3 and it scared his wife was not kidding. I have it hooked up to my A/V receiver and when a tv show was on with good bass I told my daughter to put her hand at the front port to feel the air. Well the beat changed and my daughter said it pushed her hand away. It has an easy to hook up low level line ( I used a Monster THX sub woofer wire) and since it is down firing you can place it anywhere.
2,U-neek stumbles on this one,For people who are looking for the amazingly sick production like that of east 1999 you won't find that uniqueness on this album. Uneeks beats dont even compare to those of east 1999 or anything uneek ever did for bone. I think he should stick to the bone thug style of production and not the club type hip hop you hear on the radio.
4,I Like It,This is a very nice watch. It is keeping accurate time and looks good. The only drawback is the band. I have big hands but small wrists so I cannot get the watch adjusted to where I would like to wear it.
3,Like the watch...but,"I have only had this watch a week or so. It is an attractive watch and it wears well. However, it appears to gain time, and while I don't know by exactly how much; it appears it may be as much as a minute every day or so. This is far less than I expect from Seiko. Do I have any recorse here?"
5,Spare wheel,I originally bought this as a spare sharpening wheel for my new 750 Drill Doctor. I sharpened every drill I could find (about 150) and I still haven't had to use the spare yet.
4,A Fantastic piece of work,"This album is incredibly strong even with Phil Collins helping on it. The Concert tour which I was fortunate enough to see in England was one of the best ever. She's waiting, Same old blues, knock on wood, are really driving tracks.But number 10 Just like a prisoner, I feel, is the best on the album, the way he closes it up with Behind the sun makes this an album that should be in everyone's collection."
5,Same Old Blues Sells It,"I agree that this is an underrated Clapton Album. Produced by Phil Collins, it boasts one of the best guitar solos (his guitar rocks and roars above a blues standard backing) I have heard from Clapton captured in the studio since his Cream and Derek and the Dominoes days. (Before his laid back, easy listening persona took hold) The song is a Clapton penned one called 'Same Old Blues' Indeed, if it were up to me, I would recommend the album just for that track, 'She's Waiting' (One of his strongest, emotionally charged songs since 'Layla')and the Jerry Lynn Williams song that became a hit for him and helped rejuvenate his career, 'Forever Man'. Note, The remastered version reduces the analog hiss, strengthens and brightens the overall sound of the album but the original analog transfer is just fine if you are concerned about cost."
4,"a good album and not ""purist""!","However it's not between the best works of Claptom, Behind the Sun is a good album.This album is better than the ""weak"" and ""boring"" Backless, slowhand ,Just one night and Ocean Boulevard.He has powerful as well as ""romantic""songs.In short,a good album!!!!"
4,One of Claptons Best,"Behind the Sun was Eric Claptons second album on Duck records.At this time he is moving into a new direction.This is his first album with Nathan East and Greg Phillinganes.Nathan East has been with Eric Clapton ever since.On this CD you have the hit song Forever Man which also had a video that had alot of playing time on MTV at the time.Other songs of note are She's Waiting , Same Old Blues, Tangled in Love and a cover of the song Knock on Wood. Just like a Prisoner is haunting and has a killer guitar solo as well.Phil Collins also works with Clapton on this CD and adds drums as well.This is a must for any Clapton fan and a great album.I would recommend this to anyone"
3,"OK, but ...","This album is OK. Musically it's not that bad but I have always been bothered by this one question I have with it. For an artist who is for the most part an accomplished guitarist, why are the drums more forefront than the other instruments? Including the guitar!Instead of a ""Original Recording Remaster"" who about a re-mix with the drums pulled back some?"
5,agreement,"Although the solo in JUST LIKE A PRISONER is incredible like the music fan from California states (8 Jan 2000), I feel the solo in SAME OLD BLUES is fantastic enough to purchase the cd. It is hard to believe that the song is even ON this album since the remaining songs do not come close to the playing. The aggression and soul in his playing was unmatched until FROM THE CRADLE and we can only hope he soon comes back to this form. The five star rating is for this song alone. The album in whole I give three stars."
2,BEHIND PHIL COLLINS ...,"This is Clapton's lowest point in his career, the day he succumbed to the usual record company pressure for ""GIVE ME A HIT SINGLE SOON"", or ""GIVE ME A HIT VIDEO FROM A HIT SINGLE SOON""..The album is totally commercial, what is no surprise if you check who is at the helm of production: Mr. Phil Collins, who a long time ago was a serious musician in a great band called GENESIS, but who decided to go with all his force and talent into mainstream pop music. Clapton seems lost here, the songs are inconsistent, maybe because his record company brought others producers, including Van Halen's Ted Templeman. The album is so heartless and uninspired that you can't believe it's Clapton on it. Only ""SHE'S WAITING"" appears in the CROSSROADS compilation..."
2,Lackluster Effort,"Behind The Sun was Eric Clapton's attempt to ""modernize"" his sound. Calling on Phil Collins to produce, the album has a contemporary 80's feel, with a slick studio production that all but stifles his blues roots. The album opens up with ""She's Waiting"" which is a very good song that is accentuated by the fife and drum coda. But after that, the album falters with bland music including one of his all time worst songs, the calculating ""Forever Man"". The album is revived for a bit by the strong ""Just Like A Prisoner"" in which he lets loose on the guitar. By associating with Mr. Collins, who was super hot at the time, Mr. Clapton assured himself of getting some airplay, but the collaboration fizzled in the quality end."
5,Great for the whole family,"We love this movie, my kids love the pixar movies and this one lives up to the disney name."
4,DVD Release has different ending than the cinema version,It is unfortunately that Pixar changed the ending of the movie to a more scarier version for the DVD release. We found that it's too dark and zany to watch with very young kids and the new ending spoils the experience for them. I don't understand that they didn't at least include the original ending as well so that you could choose which version to watch.Still the best Pixar movie. I hope they release a HD version which also has the original ending as an option.
5,Kids loved it!,"It was a great rental, very much worth the money we paid for it. It instantly satisfied my children's need to watch something new!"
5,fun movie,It's a very fun movie for all ages! Good humor for all! Notice how the hair gets most of the attention from the animators!
5,Incredibles-LOVE it!,5 stars!! I bought this DVD for my 3.5 year old daughter as one of her birthday gifts. She calls them the Super heroes! She LOVES it and so do I! Excellent quality and godsnet(sp) sent the DVD in a timely manner! THANK YOU!
5,Love It!,The whole family loves this movie! If you haven't seen Jack Jack Attack on Disc 2...take time to watch it!
4,Solid humor--entertaining and exciting,"The Incredibles offers solid quality in every rating category. The animation was exciting, realistic, and yet bright and exciting (pleasing both children and adults). The humor was intelligent, and multi-layered enough to please a wide age range. The plot was ""incredible"" and fantasy-like, yet realistic enough that if super powered people existed, we could imagine it playing out this way.The whole Syndrome character was a huge plus! His identity was the perfect surprise. Some may have guessed, but most, like me thought, ""Oh wow...of course, why didn't I think of it?"" Hindsight is beautiful for surprises in cinema!Bottom-line: Four stars for a solid story, well-acted and intelligently presented. I'm reserving my fifth star for an animated film thatincludes powerful commentary and appeals to my pre-schoolers (I know...it could be awhile!)."
3,Incredible,It was good but the previews gavve me a different impression for what it was supposed to be. It was sort of funny. It was sort of predictable.Mr. Incredible keeps his idenity inthe down low after he saved someone comitting suicide. When the world needs him again he takes off without anyone knowing.
4,Great entertainment for all!,"This movie kept my entire family entertained. I don't let my kids watch many movies or television, but was intrigued by this film. I had heard all the hype and was a bit skeptical. After watching this film on a rainy Saturday afternoon, I am a believer. This movie made me laugh on several occasions. I would recommend this movie. It has action and spot comedy that work well together and the animation is very well done."
4,Good but not great!,"I had heard that this was by far the best Pixar film. Therefore I went with my kids expecting to be enthralled for 2 hours. What I got was a movie that was good but had a lot of periods where I found myself losing concentration.Yes the movie has its moments. There is a lot of good adult intended humor thrown in. But I am sorry that this movie is not nearly as good as either Shrek film or either Toy Story film.With a villian who is probably more annoying than Lord Farquard from Shrek , the movie also seems to have ripped off the Fantastic Four to come up with their characters. Let's see the similarities Mr Incredible - Mr. Fantatic (similar name), Plastic Girl - Mr. Fantastic (same power) Invisible Girl (same powers), Mr. Incredible - the Thing (both super strong). And then the boy is the same as Quicksilver and the Samuel L Jackson character is the same as The Iceman.My kids (11 and 8) preferred the Spongebob movie to this one. I gave that film 5 stars and this one 3 and a half."
3,not bad --- not horrible,why is this SOOOOOOOOOO overrated?Fantastic Four and spider-man were better and this one with all other superhero movies goes between hulk & catwoman
2,incredibles...,"is OK that's it.oh yeah what's the difference between ""CGI"" and a ""cartoon""?cgi is just a fancy computer toon!!!"
2,Just fair,"I like the quality of this movie, I couldn't expect more for what a paid for. Next time I am gonna get a HD movie"
4,The Incredibles,"The Incredibles is a story about a family with super powers but they live by their secret identity in the regular world. I went to see this movie with my family & we all thought that it was very good & hilarious! Well, it is definately a family film. There is a lot of action in it. Explosions, man dropping from a building to his death, superhero & supervillian being sucked into a turbine engine on a plane,& a bunch of stuff that little, little, kids might not enjoy. When I saw it we decided to get it on DVD when it comes out. I think that it is coming out in a few months. We had been seeing previews about it for the whole year! It looked so funny! I reccomend this movie by director Brad Bird, for kids 5 & up.P.S.(thanks for reading my review on this movie.look for my review on National Treasure!)Phillip Coon"
3,Satisfied,It took a long time for me to receive my movie. The case was damaged but the movie played well. I'm satisfied.
5,Excellent! Fun! Entertaining!,"Wow this was a great movie! I have seen Nemo, Team America, Shrek 1 & 2, Toy Story 1&2, etc. This computer generated cartoon is the best I have ever seen. It's one of the first times that I found myself laughing outloud, along with the rest of the audience. The humor is more for an adult, but I think the kids will enjoy it too. :-) Go see it! You'll have fun."
5,Could Be The Best Ever Of Its Type,"Time will tell. A work of magic. Honestly I think Brad Bird must be a magician to have crafted something so beautiful and subtlely complex. I am in awe of this Pixar creation. Best film they have done so far by a longshot. Everything about it is perfection. Can't say enough good things about it except to say anyone who says Shrek is better than this needs to get a life and a brain. It is also in my opinion better than most of the superhero films we have (i.e. xmen, spiderman etc...)See this film if you want to remember what it feels like to be truly entertained by a moviegoing experience."
4,"Good, even for grown ups!","All of my kids like this movie. I'm not a big fan of ""violent"" movies for my 3 year old, but I didn't think this one was that bad at all. My 11 year old twins really love it. Frankly, I enjoyed it too! It's a good addition to any Disney collection:)"
4,"Good, but not a rib-tickler","Great movie.Although, I went into this movie thinking I would be rolling on the floor with side-splitting laughter. I smiled a few times, but that was it. It was much more of a cartoon-like serious James Bond style movie.Animation is incredible!"
2,Too Fast Paced,"In my opinion, I don't care for this movie. I don't think it's a keeper. Borrow it from the library; don't buy it. It's not worth your money.This movie is about a family of superheroes who aren't allowed to be superheroes. Yeah, it really is that bad.The family scenes show reality at its lowest- somewhere between realistic and fall-asleep boring, I would put it at the fall-asleep boring sections.There are about 3 good scenes in this movie and they aren't that long.The characters tend to speak in monotonous tones, especially Helen, which makes this movie easy to tune out.During action scenes, characters move fast! All their superpowers are in being exceptionally strong or fast or stretchy- no mind or brain powers.This DVD's only redeeming quality is ""Jack-Jack Attack,"" a short 4 minute sequence that is HILARIOUS and not included except on the 2-disc special edition."
3,almost too close to real life,"and that's not a good thing AT ALL!!!!it's not original even though everyone says it copied off fantastic four it also copied the movie called ""spy kids""!!look at the stories:1. two spies meet get married then all the spies retire.2.two super heroes meet get married then all super heroes retire.3.the two spies have kids then kids find out their spies.4.the two super heroes have kids then kids find out their super heroes. it's an exact copy of spy kids and their EVEN on an island only it has a rocket in the volcano it even looks like the one on spy kids ok? go watch spy kids then watch incredibles and then you'll see no difference at all ok?"
2,What a waste of movie budget for such weak story,"Many of the people I knew seemed to applaud for the movie. I really find almost all the characters incredibly annoying. That's just about the only incredible to this movie. I give credits to those CGI specialists who spent tremendous amount of time creating such elastic characters and by no means it was an easy feat. However, computer generate special effects does not a good movie make. Sometimes I feel as the director/producer focused too much on the CGI and not merely enough on a solid story. I guess it would be a fun movie for kids."
1,Pixar....,"Finding Nimo was a big let down.And now, the Incredibles. An over-hyped movie, with nothing but a predictable, stupid storyline. Super powers are one of the most used ideas today, and yet the Pixar had to use them.This movie is the most un-original, most disgusting, most fatigue piece by Pixar. I went out to the theater and watched this movie with 6 friends, and 4 of them walked out of the theater after 30 minutes. After the movie, we all talked how the movie sucked and how Pixar was fading.First of all, the problem is the storyline. We all know that.Second of all, the CG was nothing buy a blurrrrrr.Third of- oh what the heck. It sucked. That's it. And go ahead, click the no button below. I know how the truth can hurt."
1,Totally UNincredible,"I saw this film in theatres, and it *literally* put me to sleep. I have NEVER fallen asleep at the theatre before, but with this movie, I did. It is totally drab. The characters aren't interesting at all, the ""jokes"" didn't make me laugh a single time, the animation sucks, and it was the BIGGEST waste of $7.00 EVER. It got great reviews and won some award, but I'm still trying to figure out why. I couldn't STAND this film.I loved Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, you know - movies like this. But THIS piece of garbage just made me want to make picket signs and protest this total waste of time and money.Everyone's saying, ""oh, but kids liked it!"" No - they're children. Kids don't know WHAT they like. They see bright colors and they think it's grade-A entertainment. This is such a TERRIBLE film.AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE FOR KIDS!!! DISTURBING & DEPRESSING,"The Incredibles was a horrible film for young viewers. With references to suicide, infedelity, and traumatized lifes, this is not the kind of thing I would want kids to see. I have to admit the animation is extraordinary, the story is not appropriate for Disney.It's basically a story about a superhero being stripped of his super identity after saving a man who attempts suicide. As years pass, this ex-hero works at a job he hates (and beats up his boss), constantly fights with his wife, and doesn't involve himself in any of his three disturbed children's lives.I would warn any parent of this movie. It's not as wholesome as Finding Nemo. Disney/Pixar must have created a bad example for children."
