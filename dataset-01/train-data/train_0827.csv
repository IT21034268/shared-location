1,Liberal,"What Shapiro fails to realize is that there are different view points in a class. I've had professors who made it quite clear that they were conservative, we just questioned them. If Shapiro was so worried about ""liberal"" college, he should've gone to Bob Jones Univ."
1,Trash,"The worst kind of trash, and unfortunately part of a growing genre. If you have read anything by Ann Coulter or Michael Moore you know what to expect. This is literature in a post-literary world, where television is the ultimate form of expression. You'll find not a fact pre-digested.The author has nothing interesting to contribute other than noise. The issues he discusses are not nearly as important as his own self promotion. The deliberate, reckless destruction of other people's reputations in pursuit of notoriety is particularly loathesome. This book, like the works of Moore and Coulter, belongs in the trash. It's utterly embaressing that this style of writing has received even 15 minutes of fame in the 21st century."
5,Hits the nail on the head!,"As a moderate conservative college student I can attest to the validity of the truth that is located in these pages. I've been marked down in classes just for espousing any kind of conservative viewpoint, I've had multiple professors expressing political views in classes such as physics where politics have no place. It is no secret that a majority of college professors are liberal in ideology, the good ones keep that to themselves and do not force their views on anyone else, the bad ones(and there are many) pass off their political views as facts and are vindictive enough to take action against a student's grades if they dare relate another viewpoint.Liberalism in this country is tolerant, but only of people who feel and think the same way. Mr Shapiro does a good job of exposing the problems on our campuses, problems that we need to clean up, but obviously have a long way to go in order to accomplish that goal."
3,I watch in sadness,"I watch in sadness as my country is torn apart by political strife, where no one is allowed a dissenting opinion and respect for others is out the window. To me, this is clearly a case of divide and conquer.I ask ""liberals"" to look past the rhetoric in the book and see what legitimate complaint Shapiro (and many others) have about the higher education system. I ask ""conservatives"" to look past emotional attachments to ideals and deconstruct how our society functions (and does not function) for its members.People, we need to talk and discuss, not take sides."
1,why bother?,"I remember when this little guy was still writing for the university newspaper. He couldn't get his facts straight then, so why should anything change?"
2,Liberal: who's not?,"Certainly not the worst evocation of a cliche, ""Brainwashed"" attempts a thoroughgoing expose of the academic left. Whether it succeeds or not is probably arguable, and a not very interesting question. I also hear some of Hollywood's leading men are a tad short. But assuming it's central thesis is true - that the Professors of America are unapologetically liberal - and that the analogous claim that the media is predominantly leftist is equally valid, what's the point? Our ivory-towered theoreticians and intellectuals (purportedly shuttered from the caustic truths we call reality) and the reporter on the street (supposedly overwhelmed by confronting same) agree on politics. How could this be???????? Good luck in law school Mr. Shapiro; paraphrasing Justice Holmes, it sharpens the mind while narrowing it."
1,Bias is Bias by any name,"Sad and terribly misguided. Did you ever wonder what it was like for Anne Coulter to sit through history 101? This narrow minded rant on open-minded education gives readers a pretty good idea.Life on many college campuses is a time for experimentation, exploration, investigation and growth. If Ben Shapiro had his way, it would be merely a time when corporations and right-winged fundamentalist morons filled our heads with judgemental and short sighted theories.College is for the living and the breathing and the energized. Ben Shapiro should have taken fewer notes on what was being said and instead listened to the message. Then he could have absorbed and investigated it for himself. One thing is for sure, he would have changed his mind about how the world 'could' be instead of panicked about figuring out a way to drag it back down to what his parents taught him it should be.Instead - read anything by Molly Ivans - she'll tell about the real agenda in our country."
1,Not worth the Paper its Printed on,"A horrible joke of a book. Reminds me of the spineless conservatives I know that mask their hatred for freedom of love, sex, religion, and diversity with phony intellectual dogmas, and overt racist propaganda. This book is selling like it is because people want to be reinforced that Universities brain wash their youth. But Ben provides no quantitative data to back up his bogus claims. One day Ben will wake up like David Brock did, and realize he's been used by the radical right to push their backwards agenda. Ben will be rich, but lonely. And nobody will recall this silly little text."
5,Excellent reading,"As a student who was lucky enough to receive his degrees in something other than liberal arts, I was able to make it through undergraduate and graduate school without this type of indoctrination driving me crazy. This book really hits the nail on the head when it comes to the few liberal arts classes in which I was unfortunate enough to find myself. I doubt any of my instructors have even met a conservative, much less befriended one, or (gasp) voted for one. Just a note, the definition of fascism is: a system of government marked by the centralization of authority under a strict dictator. I don't know what Liberal to English dictionary a previous reviewer was using but I was unable to find a single mention of ""evil corporations"" under fascism in any dictionary"
1,Typical right-wing Cliche Attack Dog iffle,"Too many of these supposed 'conservative' students enter college ONLY expecting to find all of their preconceived biases and prejudices confirmed--those that they learn at home, from their peers, and their ministers, etc. When this does not happen and they are actually exposed to new ideas, they rebel, whinge, and complain--they adamantly refuse to admit that not everyone thinks like they do and has all of their prejudices. They look for validation in screeds like this--it is only for undiscriminating, tiny minds. Don't bother and enourage this !JUst look at the publisher--radical 'conservative' group who desperately hope that no one shall ever understand what a true 'classical' conservative was and should be!"
1,nasty vitriol,"Before buying this book you should check out some of his nasty vitriol online for free, such as at townhall.com"
2,Self Proclaimed Know it All,"Ben Shapiro is basically a self-proclaimed know it all. He is a youngster who believes he is right over the thousands upon thousands of Ph.D doctors in the fields ranging from economics to the environment. He does not nearly go into detail on anything, just the superficial facts that appeal to the shallow minded. Of course it is hard to argue that his position on sex and affirmative action is wrong because that is not so defined. But his position on geo-politics, economics, environmental science etc is pure rubbish. Additionally, he is a die-hard supporter of Israel and surprise surprise is jewish."
5,So True,"Things are actually so bad that it's very difficult to debate this issue with leftists. Most college students who didn't have a strong affiliation one way or the other before going to college have no idea that what they are fed is political propaganda. They view challengers of orthodoxy as ill-educated, bitter outcasts, and can't bring themselves to consider opposing views seriously. At the same time, they keep parroting vacuously about open-mindedness and tolerance, which is equated with holding liberal views."
2,"Solid Thesis, Lackluster Development","As a recent graduate from an Ivy League school, I can verify that liberal indoctrination is alive and well on our college campuses. Knowing this, I purchased a copy of Ben Shapiro's book, hoping to find some a thoughtful presentation of the truths I'd found in my own experience, namely how conservative college students are discriminated against or made to feel uncomfortable, as well as how conservative professors can't get hired or get tenured. Instead, what was presented was a tired Rush Limbaugh-like diatribe on ""The rediculous things that liberal professors believe"". I walked away saying to myself, ""of course they think those things, they're liberals!"" Essentially, while the book is often witty and potent, it fails to drive home its central thesis or reach towards any deeper, underlying issues. For a much better (though slightly outdated) effort towards this end, pick up a copy of Dinesh D'Souza's wonderfully poignant ""Illiberal Education"" instead."

1,No substance at all,This book has no substance at all and seems very poorly researched. Many of the arguments the author makes clearly have no empirical basis at all. The fact that this was published mostly seems to be related to its polemic character and the political conflicts within which it situates itself. Reactionary propaganda and not worth reading at all.
1,My College Unique?,"I am currently attending a top liberal arts college and find this book's premise to be ludicris. Our political science department is in fact dominated by neoconservatives who discriminate against liberals -- students and prospective professors. The student body is conservative, has their views reinforced in classes, and supports President Bush. The right needs to realize they're being paranoid, selective, and incoherent. Pick any college and you will find a bias one way or another - it is a matter of fact that like minds congregate together."
1,food for thought,"i haven't read the book, but i am intrigued by the argument, well more like, outraged. there is a lot of venom being spewed about college being liberal, the media being liberal, etc. the fact is, both college and the media are partisan, not liberal. there are plenty of top-notch universities in the deep south, texas, etc. that preach neoconservative values all day. this is a direct function of the regional politics. ivy league universities are in the northeast, which just happens to be a liberal stronghold. as far as the media, which is a little off subject, but relevant nonetheless. yes the new york times, washington post, cnn all lean to the left. i happen to think they're very fair in their treatment. there are many op-eds from the right side of the political spectrum. however, there are also many conservative media outlets; fox news, the wall street journal. the fact is, most people seek out a media outlet which reinforce their own, preconceived ideas."
1,one star too many,"so you fight brainwash with more brainwash?Unsubstanciated assertions, out of context anectodes, third party ""quotes"" all add up into a book that reads like a disgruntled teenager diary.While we are lucky that the author turned his feeling of inadequacy into this compendium rather than anger towards society, it might, in the long run, end up being the same.Note to the author: if the university is such an evil environment, why do you still attend it? It takes no degree to be a writer (even though it takes talent, which is harder to get than the degree).This is the blatant hypocrisy of the author: to denigrate something he's taking advantage of just for the sake of making a quick buck with this book. Shame on him."
5,2005 F150 & 2006 Escape,"Perfect fit! I bought 1 set and then bought another. Made in the U.S.A. That's why I bought these! The bottom holds tight to the floor, the top covers the underneath of the foot pedals. These are not of cheap ""offshore"" quality, American made quality. I highly recommend these."
5,Perfect fit!! Top quality.,I purchased a set for our 2007 F-150 4-door truck and the fit is just perfect. The mats are heavy and fit tight/secure both on the drivers and passenger side. Love the black color and 'Ford' design. Quick delivery.. two days. You won't be disappointed in purchasing these for your Ford!
2,"When it worked, it was great . . .","...but it didn't work for long. I purchased this mixer in late November, and it worked just fine for about six weeks. Then I started hearing a grinding noise in the motor while I was making cookie dough. I called Kitchenaid, and so far they have been helpful, and are paying for the return shipping (which is important because this mixer is rather heavy). After I purchased this mixer, friends and co-workers said that they had very good experiences with their older Kitchenaid mixers, but that the newer mixers were not nearly as well made. I often used this mixer several time a day, and I'm glad I used it enough to discover the problems during the six-month warranty period. Next time I will spend the extra money and buy a Viking mixer."
4,wonderful customer service !!,"5 stars for both Amazon and KitchenAid. 4 stars for the product. I bought the onyx pro 5 3 mos ago. Amazon sent me the wrong model and quickly sent out another one on top of the 20% discount for their mistake. OK, the 2nd one was still the wrong model but the 20% off will do. WHen I first used it, there was an electric smell which I was told would go away eventually by a KA costumer service rep. Three mos later, it still smelled. I called KA and they are sending out a pro 6 to replace my pro 5. What a great upgrade! Granted the original refurbish one had to be returned, but I'm not worried. This is my second KA mixer. The first lasted 10 years and still going. I just wanted to get a stronger, larger model to appease my love for bread making. A 10 for both Amazon and KitchenAid for customer service."
5,What a deal! Why didn't I do this sooner.,"I bake a lot as we have food allergies in our family. I just got this mixer from Amazon yesterday. Why didn't I do this sooner? It is so easy to use. I see this changing the whole way I cook. Solid, quick and still with a warranty at a great price. What more could I ask for?"
3,For what it is ...it was pretty good.,"Samira, one of the lowliest creatures of the night, devoid of emotions except for those she can glean from the dreams of men, finds herself, after thousands of years of living, curious about the mortal world. After some manipulatons of another night demon Theron...she gets to cure that curiosity. She is turned mortal and meets Nicolae...a broken, scared, man banished to a crumbling fortress. Samira learns that she is responsible, through some dreams given to a rival, for his banishment and has to set things aright. Along the way a passionate romance blossoms where in each others arms they find healing. Why only 3 stars...I don't like things that are blantantly written so they can pack in as much sex a possible. If your into that sort of thing this is a steamy book just for you. And just to contradict myself, I liked the writing style so much I bought the sequel. Go Figure."
3,Samira is a succubus with a heart of gold,"Samira is a succubus, she knows what sex is, how to do it, but she has never actually had it. But something about Nicolai (?) draws her in, either his passion for his search or his angst, which he is full of among other things.There are moments of hilarity in this book when she becomes a human. She despises water, and the bathroom thing is horrible.For half the book she is like a victim which I didn't particularly care for. I mean she knows more about sex than anyone else in the world right? But there is one scene in this book. I enjoyed the next book with Theron much more."
4,Gozo Shioda sensei knows what he's talking about.,"This book explains basic techniques of Aikido as taught by the Yoshinkan Aikido orgnanization, though it has something to teach to all aikidoka. It includes very explanatory pictures of the techniques from varied points of view, so that the reader may actually get a good idea of the way a certain move is done and in which direction to apply his or her weight.I highly recommend it."
3,Brings back memories,"This book is iconic in nature, and was Shioda Kancho's first stab into mass-market media. First appearing in the late 60's, it is certainly the first glimpse Westerners got at the Yoshinkan style, and possibly the first book many saw about Aikido, period, since it went into a more affordable paperback version relatively early, with many reprints to follow. That said, the material is pretty basic and dated, but has not hindered its popularity."
4,Good book,"I bought this book a long time ago not knowing if it was good or not. At the time I was not practicing Aikido,but I always wanted to learn something about it. I had a few years of experience in other martial arts. I think this is a good book. The pictures show fairly good the techniques. Some angle may be confusing if you are not a martial artist, but for the most part you can understand the purpose of each technique. A book will never replace a Sensei but is a good guide. I highly recommend it, because of the pictures display on each technique. The general information on Aikido history is pretty good too. Bare in mind like other have said that some schools of Aikido may do some things a little different, but in theory everything is the same. I also bought Shioda Sensei latest book that should tell you how much I liked this one.I now practice Aikido and appreciate better having bought the book years ago. I hope this helps."
3,Pretty elementary,"Although this book is well written, it is very basic and would probably do for almost any area."
1,northern gardener,I'm indeed sorry that I've allowed this weed into my garden.Reading this book will fill your brain with noise and clutter.It's as if you met a non-stop-talking-garden-nut on your way to town.Quickly gave it away to a used book store.Stay away from it.
3,northern garden plants,"Book is overpriced, but it costs even more at the bookstore.There isn't really anything new here in this book or anything that couldn't be found in other garden books, in fact, this book offers even a little less than some garden books."
1,Spice Girls? Best of their only 2 albums?,"Can someone explain to me how a group releases two albums, and then a greatest hits comes along? Why wouldn't they just release a 2 CD pack of ALL the songs and call that their ONLY songs?"
4,Am I Missing Something????,"I'm giving this collection a 4 out of 5 for only ONE reason, and ONE reason only. The entire packaging is GREAT! the Greatest Hits CD is what it should be, full of Classic HITS, No complaints here. Now, the DVD, all their greatest videos are all there, but ONE: ""HeadLines"" !!! Am I missing something? The packaging CLEARLY says ""Including the new video for HEADLINES"" .. But the video is NOT there. Is it hidden somewhere .. I have looked everywhere on the set and the video is NOT included..Where is it????"
3,Okay,This CD had a good selection of songs but it was just okay in my opinion. I had grown up loving the spice girls from the music to their dolls and all of the books and magazines about them. Maybe I am just too old to appreciate the music anymore. It just isn't quality. I remember the singles and really only like a few of them. Not really worth wasting your money buying this unless you want to take a trip down memory lane with the Spice Girls.
1,don't buy it,"The bag I received is half the size of the one shown in the photo. The handles on mine will not fit over the shoulder of a woman the size of the one in the photo. It's not ""evening"" elegant but it's too small for a useful casual daytime bag. It's inconvenient if you expect to shoulder your bag to have your hands free for shopping, holding your children's hands, etc. My advice is to skip it. I'm returning mine."
4,Enjoyable,"This CD didn't have all of Alain Barriere's famous songs, but it had enough of them to make it worth the price."
2,Don't expect to use as a multi-purpose pin...,"This pin has awesome non-stick properties, but don't expect to use it as a multi-purpose pin. We opted for the French Style thinking it would offer versatility - from pastry to pizza to tortillas, etc. During the first use - pizza dough - there came a loud snap as the pin cracked in the middle. The silicone sleeve did not tear, but there was a distinct bulge. Granted, there was a great deal of pressure applied to each end, however, it never occured to me that the core of this pin would be made of something so delicate. Disappointed, but very impressed with the non-stick properties of the silicone, we ordered the Sil-pin Baker's Pin - sans handles - and are quite pleased with it.Bottom Line: If you plan to roll only pastry, this pin will work . If you want a pin that can do it all, opt for the Sil-pin Baker's Pin."
4,Silicon Rolling Pin,"I bought this rolling pin for my beloved husband who has become a whiz at making pie crusts and pies. This rolling pin gives one a better feel for the dough and it's shape helps keep the thickness consistent. It is not as non-stick as I had hoped, but better than the wooden rolling pin we were using."
3,redsin tower,what is it with people being so greedy????? i mean a 100 ?????? are you insane????? just a big rip off to the public..you should be ashamed of yourselves!!! but it is a good film but not worth what these people are asking for it.
4,The Skulking Way,"This book really is a must for any one who reads military tactics or combat. The Skulking Way of War is the assigned term to the Native American's form of warefare. Adopting it for themselves, the colonists of the early new world were able to win both the French and Indian war and eventually their war for Independence. For anyone intrested in the recent trend of movies, such as The Patriot, or even Last of Mohicans, this book outlines the emergence of the gun in both the colonists and the Native American's way of life and how both groups changed their tactics over time"
5,Timely Commentary,"In light of the present situation faced by our military - conducting special operations across the globe, Malone's book ties nicely into what we have now coined ""modern combat"". In Afghanistan, we have seen our special operations forces ""going native"" and ""skulking"" through the bush - adopting native cover and customs to fight an elusive enemy. Malone's seminal work on Native American tactics purports perhaps a vision of what we will see our military conduct in future combat in Iraq. ""Red Mike"" Edson was obviously a genius of military tactics during WWII and Malone's work should be a must for all present and future military leaders heading into harm's way. The lessons that Malone outlines along with the lessons we learned in Vietnam, must surely be applied in the near future in order for us to successfully locate, close with, and destroy those who use terror as a weapon. A great read!"
3,Boys in the Band Go to Rome,"This movie about 4 homosexual Italian men does have echos of Boys in the Band. Not all countries are as accepting of gay men as the USA. These 4 have issues and no small degree of self hatred. Yet, unlike Boys in the Band, these men can laugh at themselves and their comrades and often do.This is not the ""Feel Good Movie of the Year"" but it does give the viewer an idea what it must be like to be a gay man in Italy and pushing 40"
1,Bitter Old Queens,"This one sets Queer Liberation back about a hundred years. It revolves around four friends (all gay) and their relationship with each other. They're pretty nasty when it comes to practical jokes. One scene, wherein all four try to seduce and rape a frightened straight man, was horribly embarrassing. As the ending credits rolled, I moaned at the waste of my time.It's an Italian feature, and I don't know what the current state of gay awareness is over there, but this film, made here, would be picketed by gay men, friends of gay men, and advocates for decent films alike."
3,Film Noir,"The film is okay if you feel like reading through the movie. In my opinion, you have to be in a good mood or know the language to see this movie."
4,Info is excellent....type set is terrible,To some it might seem trivial but the typeface and font used in this book make it tedious to read. It is well worth reading but I put it off when something else was available because I could only read a few pages before my eyes hurt. I think the font is a 7 when it needed to be at least a 10. Perhaps they used such small typeface to keep the book smaller and therefore easier to read? If so they missed the mark.
2,Difficult to read,While this book may be informative regarding adoption it was one of the most difficult books to read. Too academic and heavy. I was looking for some simple insight on how to approach the subject of adoption with my twin boys.
2,Not for everyone,"Some of the information and approaches were helpful. However, the book reads like a vanity publication, i.e., some over-educated women with too much time on their hands felt like talking about their feelings. I thought there was too much techno/psycho-babble. Perhaps its saving grace was that it made me think about how to approach speaking with my daughter about her adoption."
3,good for anyone adopting,"Well, I had gotten through almost half of the book and was about to stop reading it when it started to get better. The first half was a bunch of detailed psychological text book information that, for the most part, I did not agree with or care about- not much fact- just opinions. The second part did save it giving detailed examples and stories of real people and their adopted children: how to communicate to the children, how children communicate about their adoption, feelings of adoptees and adoptive parents, what children might be concerned about at different ages, etc. I would definitely say that it is a good book to refer to when communicating to young children."
5,amazingly real,"I confess I'm only at the beginning of the third track, but already I'm blown away. The Blue Chip Orchestra is amazing and the opening to this third track is so invigorating.I just purchased Prophecy 2 last night, the sequel to this album and I love that album as well.This music is authentic. It contains the true power of artists and musicians who work with and feel the spirit energies. This is not canned, new age music designed out of some cheap formula to sound nice. This is profound spirit music that touches my soul."
3,Lost World Review,"As a youngster when I first viewed this movie, it seemed very entertainingconsidering the fact that I was raised on the old black and white atomic enlarged monsters of the 1950's. Watching it now, I realize that the pro-duction values and special effects of today's films have rendered the oldcreature features to novelty status. The main highlight of this version of the Lost World is Jill St. John. She was one hot chick."
5,The Lost World,"I have always loved Sir Arthur Canon Doyle's best known works, the Sherlock Holmes stories. My favorites among these are the Universal Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Though these are not true to Doyle's original writings, Rathbone and Bruce did an outstanding job in their respective roles. The 1960 version of The Lost World is in my opinion the best. It does differ from Doyle's original novel. What makes this film great is the excellent performances by Claude Rains, Michael Rennie and David Hedison. Rains is a legend with such masterpieces under his belt as Sir John Talbot in the Wolfman and the title role as The Phantom of the Opera. David Heddison will go on to a very successful role as the Captain of Seaview in Irwin Allen's TV Series in Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea."
3,OK But Not Good.,"Unfortunately, the movie opened with a comic relive sequence. This effectively reset the viewer's expectation from sci-fi to comedy. It has a good underline premise, but the movie moved along unevenly, like if looking for a theme or identity. It is ok, but you would not look forward to see it again."
4,The Lost World ( Special Edition)-1960&1925 Versions,"I Have Been Waiting A Long Time For The 1960 Version To Come Out On Dvd. The Transfer To Dvd Was Good Not Great, But I Was Not Disapointed. I Remember Loving This Film Growing Up And Still Do. The Special Effects Are Not Great compared To Today, But Who Cares It Was 1960. Just Enjoy The Movie For What It Is."
4,THE LOST WORLD,"I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH,ALTHO NOT AS GOOD AS JURASSIC PARK,BUTFOR ITS TIME, THIS MOVIE WAS DONE VERY WELL."
3,Time is a thief,Films are an escape from reality. What a pity the film world is not real. Because the present world means that we will not go to hell. Mankind has made it that way.
2,"Watchable, but crude compared to today's flicks","One of Irwin Allen's earliest cinematic works. An all-star cast, but seemingly crude and cheap special effects are used. This film was probably better received by the viewing public at its theatrical release than it would be today in its video release."
4,Lots of fun,"Before computer cgi, we had these movies. So as a yound lad thatloved dinosaur movies, and only a few titles available, we gobbleup these movies and they were great to experience. Especially thismovie in which i view a yearly showing of it, is still good."
5,Movie,I chose this rating because this is one of my avorite movies of all time. I have watched this since i was very young.
3,The Lost World (SE),"This is an interesting edition of one of our classic sci-fi movies, especially for anyone who is into the old black and white version and wants to make a comparison to a more ""modern"" version done inn 1960. While the ""monsters"" in the 1925 version are a little jerky, they were ""state of the art"" in their day, and in that context, the earlier version, in my humble opinion, is better. The dialogue in the color version was canned in too many scenes and some of the special effects looked cartoonish! Still, they are both classics, and deserve their particular place in horror film history!!"
4,The lost World (1960),"Cheesy special effects. Scenery chewing performance by the great Claude Rains. Variable production values. Co-written, produced and directed by ""the master of disaster"" Irwin Allen. What's not to like. A kitsch classic"
4,One in a collection,"This version of ""Lost World"" with Michael Rennie is pretty good as one of the story...it's hard to beat Michael Rennie and Claude Raines in the cast."
4,The Lost World,"The Irwin Allen movie is a bit cheesey, but the print is good.The silent version accompanying it is better dramatically and is very well preserved."
4,Best Sci-FI Movie for the Time,"I remember seeing this movie as an early teenager and found it to be excellent for the time. Compared to movies today it seems very poor but it was a classic ""B"" movie for the times. I recommend it for anyone's video library"
5,AN IRWIN ALLEN MOVIE THATS FUN,"you just have to love irwin allen films,and this film the lost world from 1960 is just a fun gem to watch.starring david hedison,michael rennie,claude rains,fernando lamas,jill st. john.with a cast like this what can go wrong.the so called dinosaurs are just lizards with added wardrobe horns and so on.the movie is very entertaining with the brilliant cast.all in all what makes this a special treat is the print is just absolutely gorgeous.the 1925 movie is an added bonus worthy of its version of the lost world and a damn good one for a 1925 silent movie.so treat yourself to a fun dinosaur movie the special 2 discs the lost world,it's worth the money and time to add to any irwin allen collection of pure adventure films........"
3,Treasure Hunt,"Personally I think this is a fun movie. Great Sunday afternoon fare. Sit down with some popcorn and relax for some brainless fun. The cast does well, and the sets are great. The dinosaurs were considered pretty good until Jurassic Park came along. They'll still do. You can't compare older movies to todays special effects power houses unless you want to be bored watching only a handful of great F/X movies. You need to watch some of these old ones that can be fun. Not quite as goofy as the Mystery Science Theater movies and not quite as serious as Jurassic Park III. If you like the ones like ""Valley of the Gwangi"", you will like it."
4,Worth it just for the outtakes,"The first part of the tape could be better. I thought the Mary Hart interview was pretty hokey back when it was broadcast. Also, they left out some of the funniest highlights of the series.The ""bloopers"" and outtakes are hilarious though and make this tape worth buying. What I'd really like to see is this wonderful TV series in a DVD box set!"
5,"top of the line product, wow","This laptop is awesome, I have had quite a few go through my hands, they are extremely reliable and fast."
4,Information is power,"I am a professional, a therapist and consultant who works with children and their families. I am faced daily with the mother, father who agonizes over what to do when school appears to be pushing for a medication intervention, some doctors are offering one form of medication or another, and they feel if they do not go along - they are dooming their child to academic failure and social isolation. I believe that this book offers information that is not otherwise widely available to parents, who ultimately make the decisons. I feel that after reading this book, parents are in a much more empowered position to make an informed decision and are aware that enviromental factors (including the parents, teachers, school programs) hold many of the answers to working with intense children."
3,"Unable to proof the main assertions done, but...","After ending the reading of this book, I must conclude that the author was unable to proof his three main and very serious assertions: Pope John XXIII's masonic initiation; Pope Paul VI's double; and Pope John Paul II's ilegitimate son. Suming up, an obvious failure.Nevertheless, Piers Compton clearly demonstrates that Catholic Church, after the Second Vatican Council, was greatly infiltrated at the highest levels of the Roman Curia by masonic and socialist/communist agents, a fact that explains the turmoil faced by Church since then.This book deserves to be rated with two and half stars."
5,"Not a happy ending, but a good one","Nobody likes to see the last book in a series of books as great a Hansen's ""Brandstetter""-series. It's sad. Especially because of the fact that Dave really is a well constructed character that one grows to like over the years.But everything has to end someday and I think Hansen did a pretty good job. It's not the ending one would suspect. It's logical and convincing. And it's part of a very good detective-novel. The story is one of the best in the series and Hansen even takes the time to wrap up some loose ends that have been around for ages through the books.And if you like, you can read the ending as kind of an open end..."
3,a rather tiresome read...,"'A Country of Old Men' is the final installment of David Brandstetter, insurance investigator, solving crime among the loonies in Los Angeles circa 1990. Brandstetter is old and tired, as is this book. They mystery concerns a murder partially witnessed by a young boy. Brandstetter makes the police look like chumps, and the guy is even cool enough to have a hot television reporter boyfriend. The mystery doesn't amount to much, the dialogue is bland, and the surprise ending disappoints. Hansen has done much better than this.Bottom line: not recommended, even if your are a fan of the author."
5,Successful pageant.,Our church used this play last Christmas and it was fun as well as a wonderful message of Christ's birth. There were many comments about it being funny and yet the message was clear.
2,OF HISTORICAL INTEREST ONLY,"This edition of this once popular book, is of little use to the modern birder other than for historical purposes. The original was produced in the very early 1900's (my copy is 1901) and does have color photos. What is interesting is that the photos, while extremely accurate, are of dead, stuffed birds placed in what are suppose to be natural settings. Early birders, more or less shot their birds, and not with a camera! I have to give this one two stars simply because the information as to distribution, etc. is quite out dated. I would hate to think that someone would purchase this work in the hopes of owning a good book on bird identification. There are so very many good ones out there now. That being said, if you can find one of the early copies, the ones with the photos, it does make for an interesting read."
3,A Fair Effort,"I had no previous knowledge of Michael Bolton. I had heard his name but had no familiarity with his works and this was my first experience with some of his music. It was not a bad experience but neither was it was I was expecting.I had some vague notion of a performer in the tradition of Humperdinck or Tom Jones and, in a more modern sort of way, I suppose he is but he is different too. He is more modern with instrumentation and rhythms more in tune with modern music than the big band style arrangements of the past. His voice does not seem as suited to be a solo instrument but carries his tune well enough though it is a bit harsh (perhaps too harsh a term) to my ears.The songs are mostly loves songs. They are nice and pleasant to listen to but I found nothing utterly memorable.I will give him another try sometime but fell no urgency in it."
1,Avoid,"The only good thing about this cd is that it has a picture on the cover of Michael with short hair. It's about time that dude lopped off that frizzy lion's mane. I'm so glad i got over my Michael Bolton phase in the 80s. I wish he'd stop singing like he's constipated. 95% of his music is boring adult contemporary for ugly, fat women who will never get a man."
5,Wonderful Album,Just got this album and have been thoroughly enjoying it. Brings much feelings of love to the heart. Sweet. Soulful.Many great songs.
5,Michael Bolton Strikes Gold Again!!!!,"I have been waiting for a new Michael Bolton album for a while and his new release didn't disappoint. He's definitely one soulful ""brother""! I must say that this album is one of the best Michael Bolton albums I have ever owned and I would recommend it to both those who love Michael's work and those who have never given his music a try. Although, I love all the songs, my favorite song is I wanna hear you say it!! The music and Mike's sexy voice are just so phenomenal that I can't stop playing it. I also love the title track and the latin flavor of dance with me."
5,Poirot in top form,"Agatha Christie was a genius, if you like ""cozies."" No car chases, foul language or minute details of crime scenes for Dame Agatha. She is a gentle writer. This book features her greatest creation - Hercule Poirot. As always, the red herrings abound, but she lays out all the clues - no surprises at the end. We, her readers, just need to use our ""little grey cells"" as Hercule does. This reader, however, is no match for the great detective! Enjoy. An aside, if you like Hercule Poirot, check out any (and all) of the television programs starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. He is terrific. He has just the right amount of twinkle, the right tilt of the right egg-shaped head. Aloha, Pam"
3,Confusing,The plot was too twisted. There were too many people to keep track of and I was confused halfway through. This usually does not happen with her mysteries. I'm not sure if this was intentional or just how it turned out. I don't think she knew who to make the culprit till the end. Maybe persons with more complex thought processes will enjoy.
2,Missing the Last Chapter!,"This kindle version of One, Two, Buckle My Shoe does not have the last chapter. It could be that the book ends where this version stops, but in fact the book does not end there. If you want the ENTIRE book, this is not the product for you.Also, however this version was created there are wrong word usages sprinkled throughout, so it isn't very well edited.Otherwise, you can't go wrong with Agatha Christie!"
4,Interesting Set-Up,"One Two Buckle My Shoe is one of the more contrived of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels but its twisted loops are definately part of the fun. The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels. The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little. This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation. All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one."
1,Absolute Waste Of Money!,"I've never left a review for any purchase I've made, but I had to on this publication. I have 42 pieces in my cast iron collection and was able to identify one with this ""encyclopedia"". Pictures are small black and white photocopies that are so poor in quality for the most part they're little more than a silouette with no contrast. Very few items are identified by make and are simply titled ""Roadster, 1910"". Wow, glad I paid for that information! Values are highly inflated and give no reference as to condition. I would compare it to a junior high school quality publication. I will be returning it as soon as possible and will gladly eat the shipping costs."
1,Not useful for any level of Ballet,"This frustrating video often zooms in on Ilona's upper body while she is instructing so it makes it futile to follow along. Perhaps, it's not Ilona's fault but this is definitely the worst quality video made to date to my knowledge. Save your money--anything's better than this lemon."
4,Good for bad habits,"Despite the medium quality of the image, this video is quite interesting for bad habits in ballet dance. I learned ballet on video tapes and i realy had many bad habits that i did not know how to correct it. This video was useful for this. The teacher explanations are clear and pertinent. My ballet is now more graceful and less clumsy."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"I heard ""Weir"" on the radio while staying in a hotel in Australia. It was like an infection. I could not get the song out of my head. I was on a mission to find the CD. It turns out that they only had released singles and I could not find Weir. I asked a local about them and he told me that they were basically a local band (from the Northeastern Victorian town of Violet Town) that was just making it big. So, I traveled back to the States with only a memory (and an couple MP3s I found on Naperster). A friend sent me the CD the day that it was released in Australia. I have been a huge fan ever since.This is only of those CD that I can just pop in my CD play an leave it on repeat.Click the samples and hear it for yourself. The whole album is that good!I can't wait for them to start touring in the US."
5,"""Down Under"" Rocks!","Killing Heidi are one of the best new bands to come out of this country in recent times. Their debut single ""Weir"" and follow up ""Mascara"" are both great songs that will be stuck in your head all day! This fanastic band prove that we can produce quality music in Australia that is definately worth listening to."
3,Great memories come along with this album,"I first listened to Killing Heidi last summer (well, last Australian winter) in Sydney. I bought the ""Live withouth it"" single a few minutes before coming back home and I was fascinated with ""Mascara"" (acoustic version)... A couple of months later, a friend sent me the complete album and I was kind of disappointed.don't get me wrong, i do like it, but many tracks lack the strenght of ""Mascara"" or ""Weir"". Still, it's great to finally see them in America. They're so much better than many US/European bands."
2,They told me it was girl punk,"I bought this album with the vague hope of it resembling a girl punk band as numerous magazines proclaimed it was. However, upon purchasing ""Reflector"" I found it was a series of bubblegum pop ripoffs sung by a lead singer with a much too radio friendly voice to ever be considered good punk. I guess its alright as far as bubblegumpopripoffs go, but whoever wrote the reviews for the album need to put their thinking caps on."
1,music? huh!,"Killing Heidi represent the segments of the music industry that are killing music! Their ""music"" is hollow, meaningless, repetitive, and a sad indictment on the Australian music scene! Please, some more originality! Ella Cooper should learn how to sing and more importantly (i guess in her case), learn how to dance!"
5,very cool sounds from Down Under,"A very different sort of band that is finally getting its due here in the US. It is hard to find a song on the cd that is NOT good. The first song, ""Mascara"" catches you and by the second song, ""Weir"", you are hooked. They are not your ordinary run of the mill everday alternative band. The music is energetic, the lyerics are strong. This is a great cd for anyone looking for something just a little bit different."
5,Interesting movie...,"I bought this movie out of curiosity. It's pretty good, plus I like any movie with Naveen Andrews in it. I'm glad I could find it in VHS."
5,"An excellent read, and an interesting discussion of race.","An excellent read, and an interesting discussion of race relation in the South during the 1960's. Sandlin offers rare insight into the psychology of people who struggle to deal with changing social conditions in the America South. She richly deserves the awards she has alreay garnered, and probably many more.aalexand"
2,Toy never played with,I got this toy for my daughter at around 6 months. She hasnt shown much interest in it. Has never crawled for it. The music isnt that great either.
4,Fun that grows with your baby,"When my baby was a few months old, I would sit this in front of him during tummy time to encourage him to want to crawl to/reach for it. When he started to sit on his own, I would show him how to drop the balls in. He eventually did that on his own. Now that he's a toddler, he also enjoys rolling it on the floor. We roll it to each other, and that teaches play with others and cause and effect. The balls alone are fun for toddlers--they just love to throw/roll them and watch them bounce down the hall. I reccomend this toy."
4,"Fun, but no crawling","My son enjoy's this toy very much, it does not encourage him to crawl. Perhaps he just is not ready yet."
2,Attractive but Boring,My 8 month old son shows no interest in this toy at all. He has never crawled after it and I doubt he ever will considering we've had it for over 2 months now. The best thing about this toy is the little balls that are inside of it. My son enjoys playing with those. I'd advise you to buy a tennis ball instead of this. You'll save money and have a happier baby!
3,6 months too young,This toy is really for little ones who are crawling or up on all fours almost there. My son likes looking at it and trying to hold it but it rolls away and he can't get it and get's mad.
1,Not very interesting toy!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas last year and she has yet to play with it. It got rolled around a few times and my older son tried helping her with it but she never was interested in it at all. It has volume control which is nice and the music it plays is not annoying but my daughter just didn't seem to like the toy at all.
2,drum,"This one is alright. Colors are good music is okay, my daughter did not really show to much interest in this one it doesn't really roll right and the balls get stuck as it rolls sometimes. My baby was more interested in the noises that it made."
3,Doesn't Accomplish Its Purpose,"My son never figured out to roll this in order to make the balls come out (although I have pushed it all over the house to demonstrate). We bought it because he was very late to start crawling and we thought this would be a good incentive. Instead, he just dumps out the balls and puts them back in. I like the music - it's a catchy tune, and I think it's well made, but is not a toy that will encourage crawling."
3,not real interested,my toddler has not been very interested in this toy the entire year that she has had it. it has mostly been used to putting many objects in (besides the balls which go with it).
3,not all it's made out to be,"My little boy likes to put the balls in this, but once they roll out he doesn't care about putting them back in. He has never really crawled along with it. I do find it to be educational, however, because I used it to teach him how to put balls in the hole and am trying to teach him to go after the balls when they come out. He also likes to dance to the music."
4,"It's fun, but not used to crawl","This is a good toy. It's cute and the lights are great, but to crawl w/ it, my son didn't use it for that. He didn't want to push it. Putting the balls into the top is what he likes doing. It's fun to push it on the floor, but it's really only used while sitting up. This is a great gift toy instead of buying it for yourself."
4,Bee-boppin' baby,"I bought this toy for my 12 month old daughter when she was 9 mos old. In the store, when she heard the catchy music she was bobbing her head with a smile on her face. I couldn't resist and bought it. She has had a blast with the 3 balls and it was the first toy that she could get the ""shape"" into the hole. When she first did it she smiled and clapped! It never encouraged her to crawl much, but she sits and plays with it often. I love the loudness control. It has become a very entertaining toy for her."
1,Wish I had thought twice before buying this,"I bought this on the spur of the moment which was a mistake. This toy is frustrating, it is easy for a child to put the balls in but hard to get them out. My daughter never crawled after it and more than once both my children have loaded it with other toys which were then incredibly difficult to remove. This toy looks appealing because of the bright colors and the music and lights (the volume control is good) but overall is a waste of money."
2,Balls are fun to chase,"my mother-in-law bought this for my son when he was 8 months old and while he loves to chase and chew on the balls, he has little to do with the drum part. he likes to hear the music play but once it stops that's it. he doesnt have anything more to do with it. probably good for a 5 or 6 month old who havent learned to crawl yet."
4,"No crawling, but still fun","We got this drum a year ago when my daughter was 3 months old. When she was crawling, she never tried to crawl after it. However, she has always liked the lights and music. At about 8 months, she learned to put the balls inside. At about a year, she learned to put them in and then also take them back out by sticking her hand inside--turning the wrist to get them out is tricky. She likes to stick other things in it, too, especially cat toys. In fact, she and the cat share custody of the balls that came with this. She is not the type of kid who will sit quietly and play with a toy, but she will play with this if we play with her. I think a baby needs to be at least 10 months old to really enjoy interacting with this, and I don't know of any baby that would actually crawl along after it."
2,Not truly a crawl toy,"My son is now 1 and has had this toy for quite sometime. He has never crawled with it. What he enjoys is dumping out the balls and dropping them in one at a time while I count along. He loves the lights and music, so that aspect of the toy is fantastic. Although, we have just about all of the Fisher Price sound n lights toys....they could have came up with several different songs, rather than have all the toys play the same song. For example...the Crawl N Cruise playground, Pull Up Ball Blast, and the ball toy that has the two balls inside."
2,Not good on carpet....,"Is kind of hard to make it roll on the carpet isntead by trying to grab it she pushs it in one side and hits herself in the head with the other side.This toy is not for her, she prefers chasing the cat, too bad he wasn't 12.99. She likes the balls at lot and always dances to the music but if you live in an apartment (carpet all around) I woudn't recomend it."
4,"Great for the kids, annoying to Mom","I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She loved it. she would just give it a little roll, and set off that HORRIBLE music. Thank goodness for the volume control!Recently, I dusted off the cobwebs and handed it down to my son.(7 months) He is way more active than my daughter was, but he still loves it just as much. My daughter (now 2 1/2) loves to show him how to put the balls in the hole. Again, he just likes the noise. It did get the little guy to crawl after it, so I guess it did it's job! Well, both my children loved this toy, and I'm glad because I have nightmares to that little ""tune""...."
2,Not that much fun for little ones.,"My son got this toy when he was 6 months old. It never really interested him all that much. We tried to entice him into rolling it along like intended, but he just didn't want to. He kinda liked the lights and music, but pretty soon he got bored with that because it was the same every time. He did like the little plastic balls that came with it. He rolled those everywhere and threw them and to this day (he is 13 months now) will still play with those, but even at this low price it is still too much to pay for 3 little plastic balls. Maybe they could sell the balls by themselves :)"
3,Buy a few balls instead...,"I bought this toy for my son when he was learning to crawl. I thought he would be able to push it around...and now he's crawling and still doesn't push it. He is more interested in getting the balls out from the inside. It also plays upbeat music, and he does like to dance to that...However, I feel it was a waste of money. I should have just bought a few balls for him to play with instead!!"
3,the hand catcher,"My daughter and son both loved this toy. Althought when the balls would not come out they tried sticking their hand in to get the balls out. My husband and I got rid of the toy, before anything happed, and we could not get their arm out."
3,Pretty good toy,"I got this toy for my daughter so it would encourage her to crawl. Well she didn't really crawl with it, but she did learn to put the balls in the hole, so overall I think that it's an educational toy more than a toy to help her crawl. It makes sound when it moves and when you put balls inside. Overall I think that its a pretty good toy."
2,Waste of Money,"This toy is not worth the money. My son who is eleven months old was 7 months at the time that I bought this annoying thing. It has been in the bottom of my four year olds toy box for quite sometime now. My 4-year old is very creative and will play with just about anything does not even show interest in this thing. So needless to say my 11 month old who has the attention span of of a flea, will not even touch it. Do not waste your gas, time or money on this thing."
1,Glad we didn't but it !,"We received this as a gift at Christmas for our then 8mth daughter. She learned to crawl when she was 9mths. She's now 12mth and has played with this toy once. I'm glad we didn't waste money to buy it. I use it just to store her balls in there and that's the one time she's touched it, to take her balls out and that was it. She didn't like and doesn't even play with it now. Maybe it works for some baby's but she learned to crawl without it and the only good part about it is the balls, if that. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this toy in fact I would just give it away because it's collecting dust."
1,Boring,"Boring. That pretty much sums up my feelings of this toy. My son may throw it, but that's about the extent of his interest in this toy."
2,not a crawl along toy,my 10 mos old son has never crawled after this toy (he has crawled after other toys). He is mildly interested in the song and droping balls in then he's done and wants to go do something else...
2,Good idea,"I thought this toy would help encourage my daughter to crawl as it states that it would. She had more encouragment from one on one interaction with myself that she did from this toy. It has 2 options for volume control and a sensor to encourage children when a ball is dropped in from the side. My daughter is on the petite side (VERY PETITE) so this toy may have been overwhelming in size to her (She's 10mons, 13 1/2lbs.) when I got it for her, she was even smaller then. The other thing I didn't like about it was that you can only roll it one way to make the balls pop out the side because the lines are grooved on the inside of the toy to help revert the balls out the hole. It's a good idea, and reasonably priced, just some toys work for some children, others not so much."
3,Not that fun,"My son got this toy for Christmas last year, when he was nine months old. He enjoys the noise it makes, and playing with the balls, but is always very frustrated by not being able to pull out the balls with his hands. The hole just barely fits the balls, so I have to show him how to dump it out. He doesn't play with it much, as a result."
2,So So Toy,I purchased this toy for my 10 month old who loves to put things in and taking them out. I thought he would like this since it rolls and has lights and music. It's a toy that sits in the toy box. He rarely plays with it.
2,Didn't like it,"My son hated this toy. he eventually used it as storage for things that didn't fit in it and are forever imbeded in it. It seemed like a great idea, but my son prefered the ones that don't make noise, as do I."
5,Fun & educational for a child,I just loved watching my child put the balls into the drum and seeing his eyes light up when the music started. It was from that I could see he increased his interest in learning more cause & effect things in life.
4,Fun Toy,"Our 5 month old daughter recieved this as a gift and loves it. She knows that when she touches it, it will go on and play music and light up. The music is not annoying or too loud and the lights are neat even for us to look at. She isn't crawling yet, but she rolls it across the floor and creeps over to it and touches it to make it light up... which keeps her entertained and helps her learn to crawl and get around on her own. And when she's a little bigger she'll learn that when she puts the balls in, it will play music and light up too, which is a reward to her!!"
2,Smacked in the face,I purchased this toy as a christmas gift for my first child. She immediately crawled to it and pushed down on the end of the toy which came up and smacked her in the face giving her a bloody lip. Thinking that maybe it was a learning experience we let her try again which resulted in a huge knot on her head- EVERY child to come to my house did the exact same thing. If your looking for a safe toy for your child this is not it!!
3,"Not the best toy in the box, but worth having","Ok, I don't want to repeat what all the other reviewers have said, balls, lights, music, you already know all that. If you can, go to the store and listen to the music a few times. The low setting really doesn't carry far, unless you have the TV off and the lights down, but you didn't really expect an uninterrupted adult evening ayway, did you?If you get this toy you will be hearing that music, and at odd times too. My daughter loved the music for a while and really got into stuffing toys into the drum. The monkey jar effect is frustrating, but it's a lesson they have to learn. She never got into pushing it around and rolling it, but it was great when she was learning to put toys into things.The drum is sturdy as can be, the balls leave something to be desired, one got stepped on, the other two were tasty treats for the dog. Any ball or other toy smaller than the opening can and will end up in this one once the original balls are gone."
3,jeeper,Not to bad needs to be a little bigger for a truck. Not very deep if you get in a lot of snow and slush. But overall looks real good.
4,I like em but I wouldnt go crazy.....,"These are good floormats..It should really stop there because some of these reviews convinced me these floormats were going to be something outstanding. they are not. They are rubber, they bend and they look ok in my 2011 Dakota which has grey interior. The seem deep but not any deeper then any other plastic floormats.The bad news: I did not get the wonder mats I expected to get.The good news: I did not get screwed."
3,Great mats just didnt fit the description and picture,"The mats are great. However in the picture and description they show only the red dodge logo, The mats that I received have the dodge logo with RAM written under it. Now I have Ram mats in my challenger."
4,Chipotle is my universal spice,"I like spicy, my son does not so my wife cooks bland. I keep a jar on the dining table and add it as a condement. This is a lot, but I go through it quickly."
2,"Too spicy ""flavor"", too fine grind","The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos. That is NOT the case with this powder. This ""Chili Chipotle Powder"" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose. YUCK!Stick with a plain old generic ""chili powder"" instead of this."
1,not as advertised,"From the picture they look like studs, and well it says they're studs, but they're not. They have a huge metal base and are quite ugly, the picture doesn't represent the actual product at all. I can't even give these things away."
2,Don't bother!,"As others have said before, these are huge. Not only this, but the backs are pretty horribly done.I find myself missing both backs after less than a month. How'd they disappear? They fell off while I was sleeping. More than once I found them on my bed, next to me, but there were two times that they just up and disappeared. This is what you call shoddy workmanship.Don't bother with these things, they're a waste of money."
5,Must have for teen parents!,"I will say this much to understand your teenage kids' need and why they act certain way and who is influening them you must read this book. You don't have agree with all of the text, but I can tell you that you will find it educational to say the least. By the way, if you don't want to spend money on this than get it from your library."
5,Author of Survival Meditations for Parents of Teens,Another sure winner from Dr. Taffel who always seems to hit the mark.I recommend this to many of the families with teens who I seen in counseling as it offers a real-life look into their world. Absolutely one of the best in his field.
4,Wife loves it! She would give it 5 stars,says it is her souls music. listens to it all the time. Really picks her up. Received it pronto no worries.
1,Irritating Chanting,"What does this cd sound like? A chorus of voices going into irritating chanting over the same pounding drum beat. Each track sounds and begins the same. One of the tracks is called ""Jive & Wail."" That's every track; I can't help but imagine bats going into convulsion when listening to this, the scary noise they would produce would come pretty close to the voices on this cd for all 43 minutes and 13 seconds."
4,good feeder,"Feeder works well. I had to partially prop open the lid to show the little rodents how to get to the unsalted peanuts, but once they caught on I can keep the lid down and when a squirrel wants a bite, they readily open the lid and help themselves."
3,There must be a better design out there somewhere....,"This product is unfinished wood, so if you want it to last, I suggest you paint it before setting it outside. I received mine and within 3 days of being outside, in sunny Southern California weather, the lid had cracked in half. The vendor (in my case, Ace Hardware) said they would replace it but a month has gone by and no replacement yet.Another issue is that the lid is quite heavy for the size of the design, and the squirrels couldn't lift it. I had to devise a wedge to keep the lid propped a little so that the squirrels could reach a paw inside and grab a nut. Including some kind of optional wedge or lid prop in the design would be an improvement.Also, you are meant to nail or screw this into a tree. If I were designing this myself, I would do so with a couple of hooks on the back so that you could hang it from a branch or over the edge of a fence or something, rather than traumatizing a poor tree....but hey, maybe that's just me."
1,Squirrel trap!,I had to free a squirrel who caught his foot at the hinged edge of the lid when another squirrel jumped on the lid and shut it. Solution: took the lid off!
3,Bought the book 'cause I loved the movie,"I was so impressed with the court scene and the speech about man's best friend in the movie (by the same name, and with Lionel Barrymore) that I had to have a copy of it. I mistakenly thought I'd find that speech in the book. Hollywood took artist license with that but I was still impressed to find that the book was inspired by a true life story. This book led me to find the very interesting facts when I researched it via my computer. The speech was actually spoken although the actual event was altered some. See the movie, read the book, then look up the history. Great stuff."
3,Not always applicable,"are the tenets of Murray's book, to an advisor who has been in the business for a while already. This may be the ultimate blueprint for someone just entering the business (and I would recommend for that purpose). But for those somewhat established, Murray presents the blueprint without providing solutions or specific course of action to ""get there"". Everyone's recipe for success will be somewhat different, but having this roadmap to being a successful advisor, albeit in theory more than substance, can set the path for a long and successful financial practice."
2,Read the last pages of the chapeter and theh book is great!,"I don't know hate to give a bad review, it was HIGHLY recommended by my broker dealer and told us it's one of the best, but to be real found it repetitive, it is good for any new advisor of which I am 2 years in, there are good points in the chapters but if you go to the last page summary of each it's good! Suggestion is to condense the last few pages of each chapter , make it a soft copy 20-30 page easy read and would say the book is very good, I do give sincere credit to very good marketing at a high price, ,OK there is good points but it's just not a fun read till you get to the last pages. Felt like to make a book one must need to fill so many pages vs. getting to the point. Guess if it was a cheaper would give a higher rating, my apologies!"
1,Missing Data,"If you want to use this handle you need to know how it attaches. Many handles look like this on the outside, but the Valley handle slides over a shaft and attaches with a set screw through the side of the handle instead of the top. There is no indication of how this handle attaches."
2,Umm...An all right game,"This game wasn't all right, I was wrong. The music isn't that great, and the gameplay is kind of er-bad. Don't waste your money on this."
3,kids not interested,"Tried this game based on rave reviews, wanting to help keep my 7 and 11 year old(s) entertained.They tried it once, didn't like it, and gave up."
1,Category: What were they thinking?,"I know it is extremely tempting to purchase this game after being hypnotized by their promotional savvy. Looking at the pretty colors on the gamecase and reading the tagline ""Puzzle Fun With Wild Music And Crazy Bubble Action"" makes you quiver with excitement. However, you need to gather up every ounce of restraint you can muster and DO NOT buy this game!The objective of the game is simple. You need to line up at least three bubbles of the same color either horizontally or vertically. Sadly, poor game design makes it difficult to line them up horizontally so, um, that doesn't leave you with much.A game this basic seems odd to me due to the widespread ownership of computers. You can play pointless time-killers similar to this game on the Internet for free. We have, as a civilized society, progressed beyond the need to develop and charge people to play this sort of thing on their home gaming consoles. At least...I thought we had."
3,Just a little too big.,I was hoping the size would get a lot done but there is not enough weight for the length of the drum
4,"GOOD PRODUCT, poor customer service","The order arrived fast, and the lawn roller is heavy duty, easy to assemble, works great.4 stars due to the box was destroyed and some hardware was missing. About 4 weeks later the missing parts I ordered arrived.Would have given 5 stars even with the missing parts with the exception of slow customer service."
4,Plastic,"Beware:: This roller is plastic, not metal! It won't rust but it CAN get holes in it! It arrived with the start of a hole already! It does the job and is cheaper than you will find in stores (BECAUSE IT IS PLASTIC) but just know that it is only PLASTIC because the description failed to mention that!!"
4,Good deal for the money,"The product arrived promptly, even though I used the free mail. Easy to assemble and works well. I use it to level mole tunnels and it does the job. I have used it both by hand and with a lawn tractor. Pretty hard going by hand when full but can be done."
2,PLASTIC ROLLER,"THIS DOES NOT HOLD SHAPE IN MIDDLE FLATTENS OUT SHOULD HAVE WEB INSIDE ROLLER TO KEEP ROUND TRIED WATER IN IT, TRIED SPEEDY DRY IN IT EVEN WHEN EMPTY FLATTENS OUT IF YOU USE IT A LOT WILL ROUND BACK, OVERALL BUY THE SHORTER ONE!!!!!!"
4,For me this book was a great escape...,Following this guy around on his spiritual journey was both riveting and calming at the same time. I think he exaggerated some experiences at times but that did not detract from the more personal & compelling passages. The author is very sincere in his quest and his writing style brings life to the amazing people he meets and writes about. The detailed references made to that particular time in the world make the book even more interesting. His exchanges with his final master the maharshi are partcularly fascinating and impart timeless wisdom. I really enjoyed this book - it was charming to read and a great antidote to my usual cynicism.
5,Excellent Jazz Vocals,"Loretta is not only one of the most talented jazz vocalists in Hawaii, but quite possibly one of the nicest people you'd ever meet. Her musical interpretation of the standards are clear and smooth. Day In, Day Out is probably my favorite track on this album, and as a jazz DJ, I work it into my sets quite often.Buy this album, and if you're ever in Hawaii check her out live on Saturday nights at the Kahala hotel, singing with local jazz pianist and legend Betty Loo Taylor and her band."
3,Good for an hour or so of fun reading,"The book is just an elaboration on the ""Talk like a Pirate Day"" and if you think that is funny, you'll like this book. I got my copy from the library, and really one reading is enough. It's more like a very long Dave Berry article so some parts arrr a bit repetitious if you get my drift. Still though Capt'n Slappy will whack you upside the head to get you to buy this book in an effort to keep from doing real work.Still if you realize that these guys are having fun, why not join in and talk like a Pirate. Borrow this book to read from the Library and enjoy a cold one next to the fire while you plan out your pirate party. You could waste more time having less fun reading serious stuff."
4,Arrgh!! Matey,"This would be the quintessential tome on how to be a pirate, if pirates could read and used word like ""quinessential"" and ""tome"". Just say it be a roarin' good chart for those who are wantin' to be a pirate"
2,you outta be in pictures,"I was a little dissappointed. This is a funny book, and these are obviously funny guys. The live show must be outrageous...but then, the live show probably has props. That's what this book needs. It's a lot of words.... a lot of funny words, but all crammed in together with no real break. After about 30 pages, you start to anticipate how each subject will be addressed. Kind of like this review, after the first part, you know what the rest will be like. Imagine how much more interesting it would be if Amazon would let me illustrate my review.... imagine what a great book this would have been if they had chosen to use some ILLUSTRATIONS!!! (If the cover say's ""Funny book"" when you see it... look at the cover again, and imagine it with just the words and no pictures.. that's the book. p.s. Yes I often enjoy books without pictures.... but this wasn't one of them."
1,"Mildy funny, mostly tiresome.","This had a few funny bits, but I think I only laughed out loud twice. The second half of the book was painful, it had gotten so predictable. I could have finished it for them. For humor, it relied almost exlusively on turning everything pirate-related into a sexual joke. It got old fast.Style-wise, they try very, very hard to be Dave Barry - even going so far as to suggest that a funny phrase is a good name for a rock band. I suggest that you skip this effort and go straight to the original, who makes me laugh out loud on nearly every page."
2,Rather academic for small group or Sunday School use,"I was looking for a study that might help church members who are ""put off"" by the word Evangelism. However, this book was rather academic, and spent too much time negating what ""has been"" before getting to the ""new vision"". Had I been captured in the beginning by something helpful and new, I might have had more motivation to wade through what has not worked and the reasons why."
3,nice design with flaws,"This am/fm radio met all of my specifications ; well designed , easy to use and thoroughly portable . Even though I wanted something that was light to carry , I was disappointed in the tinny sound . Somehow I had hoped that the Panasonic name would provide a better product . Too bad that we radio fans aren't given better options except in our cars . And also the other option was a boom box which would have meant that I'd have to carry a big heavy object throughout my home ."
4,A great french house cd,"This cd, although very mellow, is a definite buy. If you like french house you must buy this one, you won't be disapointed if you're looking for relaxing house. A must-have. Merci Stephane."
3,Nice Suprise?,"Well first of all I must say I am not the biggest dance fan but i picked this up at a clearance sale for one dollar and rather than selling it i had to keep it, is really good stuff, a great mix of different types of dance music, never gets boring, pick it up, a nice suprise!"

3,Fun book,I love this book! It is meant for an older flower girl (or the parents have to fill it out) Will be really neat keepsake for when they get older.
5,When I was a Flower Girl,This book is a wonderful gift idea for a flower girl. It explains everything about the wedding and everyone in the wedding while providing space for you to write and add pictures. The flower girl can also add her own input and pictures.
4,Nice Book,"I thought this was a nice book. It has plenty of pages for pictures and writing about the wedding-related details. I filled out the first page for my flower girls that had their name, address, and how they knew me info. I think this book is a neat idea... when the girls are older they'll be able to remember being in a wedding better by going through it time and again."
5,Love Amelia Peabody!,"What can I say, I adore Amelia Peabody and in fact almost everything Elizabeth Peters writes. Another great story, but if you're new to Amelia Peabody, start at the beginning, though you could read this as a standalone novel."
3,Out of Place,"*spoiler for falcon at the portal*I enjoy these books and think they can be very fun to listen/read (barbera rosenblat does an excellent job of reading and inhabiting the characters).I think if I could listen/read these books over again, I would prefer to read this before The Falcon at the Portal (its actual place in the time line). To me it seems to help make sense of events that occur in that book. It might have even created a bit of mystery surrounding ""little bird"" and helped to explain Nefret's reaction.Overall a good book, but not the best in the serious."
2,Is this really an Amelia Peabody?,"I am a devoted Peters' Peabody fan and was sorely disappointed by Guardian of the Horizon. It doesn't taste like a Peabody book. The dialogue, the action, even the personalities of the characters seem dimmed and faded. I realize Peters was attempting to convey the psychological hardship the family endured, but what happened to the Emerson family spunk? ""Newly-discovered journal"" books spliced into a series after-the-fact hardly ever satisfy a reader, and this is an example of such."
1,A Poor Shadow of a Book,"This book is an attempt to return to the success of ""The Last Camel Died at Noon"" but Peters has lost the characters and their voices. Nefret, normally a strong-willed, competent young woman becomes a frightened, timid creature. Sethos, our charming, masculine, romantic hero becomes a very minor character and fairly impotent in terms of heroism. Commonly used expressions by Peabody and Emerson are replaced with expressions they don't use in other books. There are a variety of disconnects with facts as they appearin later series books--this book doesn't really fit well. If you are not a die-hard Peabody fan, this book may be sufficiently entertaining. To one who is a Peabody fanatic, this book is very disappointing--what did Peters do with the real Emerson clan that we know and love?"
2,Not one of her better efforts,"I get the impression that EP wrote this book(and set it in the past) because the Amelia Peabody series may be losing some of its appeal. After all, Amelia and Emerson are now getting old (hard to believe that Emerson can still be an ageless 'hunk' in those later books). So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books. This book was simply not up to the usual EP standard.On a more personal note. After ready all of the books in this series I am starting to grow weary of the pretentiousness, superiority and pomposity of the entire Emerson family."
2,Guardian of the Horizon,"I don't understand what went wrong! I realize that there must be conflict and struggling with others or self to make a book gripping... but Ramses falling in love with another woman? How could he talk of fidelity to his mother in ""He Shall Thunder in the Sky"" and then have this happen in ""Guardian of the Horizon""? Doesn't Peters remember what she wrote? Sex and lust for another person I understand, but falling in love...come on! I hope her next books in this series (if any) don't fully degrade into inane reading, especially if Peters, intends to have a child come out of Ramses' and Daria's...um abberations."
2,Not her best effort by far,"As a fan of this series, I found this work extremely disappointing. It reads more like a short story than a novel; barest outlines of events and characters, some outright errors in continuity within the book's lesser characters, lack of the usual careful filling in of local (historically accurate?) color. Truthfully, not worth reading as it adds nothing to the series and is cetainly a poor example of Ms. Peter's work. I sincerely hope she doesn't continue in this vein with this series, which previously was one of the best. If so, she will lose a great segment of her audience."
4,"Not the best, but still good","More so than usual, this was quite a book to keep up with. The plots upon plots and intricate character web were a bit difficult to follow, and even though I've finished I still feel as if there are several storylines that weren't resolved.Even though Ramse's romance with Daria bothered some people (including me, to an extent), it's really not that big of a deal, especially considering that it's never mentioned in the rest of the series.A lot of people complained about this book, but I though all and all this was a cute, well-written read. Like many other fans, I was just happy to find out that Ms. Peters had written another one!"
2,An Amelia Fan,"I looked forward to this book because I have thought for awhile that it would be a great idea to discover some of those lost journals and fill in some time gaps. However, this book was not satisfying at all. I loved Ramses as a child. However, the grownup Ramses I find a dull bore. Please Ms. Peters, for future books with lost journals find some further back in time when the focus can be on Amelia and Emerson whose relationship is the heart and soul of these stories. The later books focus too much on Ramses and Nefret."
4,Comfortable but Leaky and Foggy,"These are very nice goggles, much better than the speedo googles i have tried but be prepared to put a lot of work into adjusting them for your face.I know I must be doing something wrong yet I have put a lot of effort into these and they still leak and fog up in the pool (not climate-controlled)."
1,"Tricky to fit, easy to break, quick to fog...but comfy","The only thing these goggles managed to do was avoid pulling my eyes out of the sockets. It took about 30 minutes to put them together (a bad sign that they come with their own tool), but the fit was never great and tended to leak. They come with an anti-fog solution that works for about 15 minutes. I used these about 20 times before the nose piece pulled loose from those tiny screws--and of course, I'd misplaced the little tool by that point. Expensive too. I guess it's back to the raccoon look for me."
5,The ONLY guide you need for these cars,"A hard to get, but a must have if you are interested in these Italian cars. Written by Alfred Cosentino who has been involved with and owned most of these cars, offers a huge amount of information on every single model made. Photos and specs included."
3,Body By Design review,"We bought this for my daughter's 11th grade science, along with some supplementary materials. This book seems great, but I cannot say more, as we have not yet used it."
1,cheap imitation of a comb,"I miss the old rubber (i.e. unbreakable)comb...and after looking around i recentlypurchased three (3) of these combs from Amazon. Yes it is 5 inches long, howeverthe width is less than inch. If you have large hands this comb will feel like you're combing your hair with a pin...it is so small!!! Unbreakable? Yes i guess youcould call it that, however, it bends in your pocket if you sit on it. I'm sodisappointed with this comb!!! Bring back the old rubber - unbreakable - comb thatwon't tear up your scalp...as this comb is also harsh on the scalp. I guess i could use these combs to seek out fleas/bugs in my dog's coat....maybe...if he doesn't getdermatitis first!!!!"
2,Poor product description,"This replacement bowl while seemingly well made, is described as fitting the Cuisinart DLC-1, which is clearly not the case. The bowl's bottom has a very different design than the bowl it replaces. There was either was a design change, or the description for this unit is for another machine. I'm a disappointed customer because this bowl is useless for my DLC-1."
3,Guess I was wrong,"I purchased this but it doesn't fit with the unit I have. I have the DLC-1, but maybe they changed the design from year to year."
5,Complete & Simple to utilize,I thought I knew and understood a bar/beverage operation from years in the business. This book confirmed my basic knowledge and taught me new principles every chapter. This is a must for every owner and the bar personnel who want to gain more insight and working knowledge.
4,good stuff,"covers all the basics and threw a couple of new ideas my way as well. I'm a veteran operator, 20+ years experience."
4,"great price, fast shipping","Book arrived quicker than expected. Described as ""like new"" although one corner of the book was crumpled a bit. Would recommend seller."
3,Miele accessories,Quality is good and matches the vacuum quality but the engineering is bad.The problem: there should be an adapter to attach the accessoryto the main hose not the vacuum itself.You should be able to add the carclean accessory to the hosewthout having ti disconnect the main hose.Then adding to the carclean hose would be a snap.
2,weak and boring,I like Davis Drake but this book is a dumper. I could't take more than 1/4 of this book before I donated to Salvation Army. What happened to Hammers Slammers and interesting books
5,Great Album To Start With,"Even if you're not a fan this is an excellent album. All of these songs are upbeat synthpop. This greatest hots album is the only Echoing Green album I own right now and I bought it without knowing much about the band but I have loved it and am looking to get more. All of the songs are synthpop but not too heavy on the synthesizers. If you don't know anything about this band this is the album to go to first. The remixes on the CD range from good to decent but I would suggest looking at that as an extra and buy this album for the singles, unless you're a fan and you already have most or all of the disc 1 tracks, then disc 2 would be a good investment."
5,The very best of The Echoing Green 1994-2000,"You definitely don't want to miss out on this one! 2 CDs chock-full of pure synth goodness that makes you want to get up and dance, turn up the bass to full when riding in your car...you get the general idea. Disc 1 contains 17 smokin' originals, and Disc 2 has some hard-hitting remixes that will please any dance/techno/electro/synth crowd. (Be sure to also get the Evergreen Annex CD for even more remixes!) Rock-solid all the way, this signifies the band's efforts for 6 years straight but still tEG goes strong. A must-have for any synth collection!"
5,"""Shadow and Light"" one of Chaquico's Best!","It's been a long wait for Craig Chaquico fans, like myself, waiting patiently for a disc of new material from the New Age-Jazz legend, but after listening to Chaquico's first recording in four years you'll find that it was well worth the wait.""Shadow and Light"" is one of Chaquico's finest outings yet. Once again produced by himself and Ozzie Ahlers this disc triumphs. His seventh disc has both acoustic and electric guitar on four of the ten tracks.From the opening track ""Innocent Kiss"" to the final track, a remix of his #1 hit ""Cafe Carnival"" off his greatest hits disc ""Panorama"" you'll find no better new New Age-Smooth Jazz disc out there. My personal favorites are tracks five and six ""Keepers of the Flame"" and ""Afterglow"".This CD is a must have for new age, jazz and Chaquico fans alike. Get it!"
2,i wanted to like it but...,I tried to like this book but found it very disjointed. The jumps the author made (in story and emotional content)kept me rolling my eyes and wondering why I didn't just put it down. I added the book to my wish list based on the other reviews but I have to wonder 'what book did they read?'
4,Playing a NES game again,"This FC Yobo NES machine is awesome. I didn't even have to blow in my carts like I used to, or shake them, or anything - just put them into the machine and played. I love the led light too.Only one complaint - no release system for the games. You end up almost yanking them out, but you don't want to yank them out. It's an art you'll have to learn with this system. Other than that I can still play Duck Hunt with my gun and everything. I feel like I'm 8 again.@ the reviewer above: By no means did I try to say that this will ruin your cartridges. No no no, not at all. I have had one since it released with a bunch of games bought from different people at Amazon and Ebay, almost all working with my Yobo (one seller sold me a broken game). No, this system WILL NOT HARM YOUR GAMES. You just have to kinda yank 'em out until the system wears in and then it's not so bad."
3,game destroyer :(,"This is a great consol but it wears out your nes games. If I were you don't waste your money on this consol. Save your money for the nintendo revolution because it can download up to 20 years of old nintendo games like nes,super nes, and the nintendo 64."
1,HORRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY!!,"AVOID THIS SELLER!! Sent the wrong system with the wrong color and it stopped working in a week, DO NOT BUY!!"
1,A cheep peice of junk.,"I am incredably disipointed with the quility of this NES clone. I bought it yester day, and it already doesnt work. When i first tried it, one of the controlers did not work, and still will not work. I had trouble putting games in it, and when i removed a game, it ripped the motherboard free. one of the AV pronges broke off and is stuck in m tv. Do not purchase this!"
4,"A bit cheap, but worth it","The console and controllers feel very light and cheap, but for the price it's plenty acceptable. Works perfect. My only real complaint is that the games are really hard to pull out of the system. I'm sure one day I'll break it that way. Overall a very nice product for an excellent price."
1,Very disappointed!,"I ordered this game console and just like some of the other customers, I tried to insert 3 different game cartridges---and they won't even fit to play it!!!!!!!!!! I bought it b/c I heard so many good reviews on it,but the games will not insert. I am highly upset b/c I bought it about 3 to 4 months ago and in April I just got around to opening it, and it's not working! Is there any possible way of exchanging these for another one if impossible to get a refund?"
2,Yobo is not all that great,"I bought one of these YOBO things last year because I was like many of you. My old NES was dying and could not play my games like it used to. The Yobo is not that great, really. It plays most of my games, but at the same time, it doesn't play some of them. For some reason, it won't play games like Mega Man 3, Bad Dudes, Ice Climber, etc. while they play perfectly fine on my old NES.The real anwser is to replace the pin-connectors on your old NES, and to keep your games clean!! Stop blowing on them!! Get some rubbing alcohol and some q-tips to clean those games!"
3,Pretty good for what you pay.,"Managed to get most of my games working (all except Legend of Zelda). It's all right for its price, but you can probably find something better."
4,Fantastic Fantasy,"This is a very interesting book. I think the illustrations are easily enjoyed by collectors, enthusiasts and just the average reader alike.The commentary in addition to the images really gave depth to the Illustrated History. In addition, the formatting of the book, having sections for different strains of the fantasy genre, was very convenient.Overall, a very fun and visually stimulating book."
3,A Fantasy Fan's Dream,"The birth of fantasy began much like that of science fiction, as a matter of fact fantasy stories and science fiction stories were often published in the same magazines, such as Amazing Stories and Weird Tales, but while Science Fiction of the 20th Century goes into great detail on the many scifi magazines, Fantasy of the 20th Century touches on these magazines, again with beautiful pictures, but then focuses on the many, many novels that were published within the genre, beginning most notable with authors like J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. What is also looked into is the world of fantasy film that has developed with the genre. The result is a most amazing book that takes you on a unique journey through history and different mediums all pertaining to the vast genre known as fantasy.Originally published on April 8th 2002.For over five hundred more book reviews and exclusive author interviews, go to BookBanter ([...])."
5,Excellent Product,I love using this product. Any question or concerns and the tech support gets back to right away. This program breaks down the nutritional value in your recipes as well. I reccomend this to everyone.
5,The greatest novel of the twentieth century,"This is the best novel of the century's best English language novelist. The plot is sure-fire (kid runs away with the carnival), the characters memorable (sideshow freaks, revealed to be--human beings! theater people, great and small, revealed to be--human beings!), the sins enormous (pederasty, pride, perhaps even murder), the virtues marvelous (love, devotion to love). The theme of this book, as with the other books in the trilogy, is search for self--the main character of this book lives four different lives during his life. This book works on every level; it reads well as a story, gives you something to think about, and stands up to any number of readings you'd care to give it. (I've given it at least five.)"
5,great collection,"This is a great collection of this unique band's best hits. If you like alternative or indie with a bit of a twist, you'll love this band. The voices are addictive, and their style is unlike anything else."
2,"Not a very helpful book, unfortunately.","Every time I pick up a new investment book, I hope it will have new ideas and insights. Thi sbook really didn't."
3,Pretty Good,"Ordinary People was a fairly good novel, but definately not one of my favorites. It is touching in the realistic portrayl of Conrad's depression. I probably would have liked it better if read on my own time, instead of in AP Communications, where one must analyze every last word."
1,Novel Says Nothing,"This novel is boring, has a jumbled beginning, drags in the middle and rushes the ending. It's saving grace is that it capitalizes on common human feelings and relationships, while never really saying anything. The theme, as near as I can figure: ""You are unique, just like everyone else."" Who doesn't relate to Conrad? Comments welcome."
5,This is a grrrrrrreat book!,I enjoyed reading about the struggles of a modern day family. I had a lot in common with this book. I suggest this book to ANYONE who enjoys realistic fiction!
3,Better the I thought it would be,"Ordinary People by Judith Guest is a good book. By good I don't mean it's great, but it's not bad, and it's worth buying. Ordinary people is about a boy who struggles with life after an attempt to commit suicide. He has a hard time doing this which will eventually hurt friendships and his family. The things I found most enjoyable about this book were the boys relationships with other people. For instance one of his best friends is a ""strange"" psychiatrist that at first he doesn't really want to go to. Where as he and his mother almost border line hate eachother. The major downside to this book is it can be very dull at times. At the beggining it takes a good amout of time to get interesting. Overall I would recomend this book."
4,great book,"This tells the story of a seemingly perfect family and how it cracks apart when the oldest son drowns in a boating accident. The son who survived cannot deal with the guilt he feels, and attempts suicide, leading to a prolonged stay in a psychiatric hospital.When Conrad gets out, he is faced with the task of putting his life back together. In this he is aided, however ineptly by his father, but receives little help for his mother, who would like to pretend the problems never existed. He also begins to see a therapist, (played by Judd Hirsch in the Oscar winning movie), who helps to teach him not to be afraid of his emotions and that perfection can come at an unbearable cost.An excellent book."
2,i thought it was a little boring but was very true to life,i thought the book was boring but it related to every day problems. It could of happened to anybody to be frank i thought the book was boring and was only so-so
2,VERY HARD TO FOLLOW!!!,"This book was very hard to follow. It seemed that one character would be thinking or talking about something, and all of the sudden it would be another character talking. An example of this would be when Connor starts talking about his brother Buck and then it starts saying that his dad wasn't taking it to well. The book didn't seem to have any point. It was about a kid who's brother had died in an accident, and he tries to commit sucicide. I feel bad for Connor, but I just can't relate to it. Also the language was pretty bad. Some of the language just wans't needed. I think some of it was just there to be there, not for any reason. The book also didnt have enough detail. For instance when it says his brother dies it doesnt say where or any detail. It just says he dies from a boating accident. Even that is hard to get out of the book. For me this book it a little to hard to follow, but try it out."
2,Confused!,"When I began to read this story I was confused, in the first chapter the narrator swithces all the time and you can't figure out if Mr. Jarrett or Conrad is narrating, then I thought it was just one person. Guest makes it seem that Cal, short for Calvin, is a girl, but then skipping forward I found out that it was a guy. I didn't even bother to read the end because after trying to re-read what you read it's more confusing then the first time. This book is for slow, boring readers, and I bet they won't even understand. There's a part about carbon monixide death, and where Conrad is thinking of something when he try's to sleep but that part does not make any sense, it just wastes time. If you want to be confused, this is the book for you!"
1,Not as good as everyone says,I thought that this book was terrible. It is written very poorly. I would rather have saved the time and the money and gone out and read a Richard Matheson or Jack Higgins book again.
2,Dull book,Most people like this book but i think it was too slow paced. It was also a bit confusing because it switched narratives alot and didnt make it clear especially becuase the father and son had similar names. The book just didnt appeal to me. It was a little shallow and uninteresting. It was slow to begin and slow to end. There was basically no action in this book.
1,Not interesting at all...,"This book is not at all interesting. I cannot get into it. This book, in my opinion, is not exciting enough to read, especially 263 pages."
4,stunning,"I have had depression for several years and I would have to say that this is one of the most realistic portrayals I have seen. I saw so many parallels between the Jarretts and my own family, it was frightening. Some of you out there who haven't dealt with this stuff might find this book boring, or unrealistic, or something, but if you are depressed this book is an incredible catharsis. It gives me hope that healing is possible."
5,Specific to Kindle version,"I won't try to add to the widely varied opinions about the book itself. However, I would like to comment on the quality of the Kindle version. It was obviously scanned and then digitized using an OCR program. There aren't a LOT of errors from this, but there are the occasional letter substitutions and nonsense words and more frequent punctuation errors. I found it quite distracting. It would have been nice for someone to spend a few hours proofreading it before publishing it this way."
5,A Classic,"Judith Guest has captured, in timeless fashion, the pain that is experienced by the untimely death of a child. She reaches into the heart of the characters and they are real. Conrad's struggle from the throes of depression is so rich and painfully real. Guest gets it right. This is a classic."
2,Dated and Confused,Ordinary People relies on old and worn views of the value of the mental health profession in a family conflict drama that does not rise to the level of providing inspiration or insight.
3,Slightly boring,"I borrowed ""Ordinary People"" from a friend quite interested in it. The title and concept of the book from the blurb sounded good. Although when i got into it, the story unfolded very slowly, not much action going on, and is really quite depressing. I'm a book lover and would recommend it because it wasn't a waste of time, just that i didn't feel like much was accomplished by the end. The movie about the book won Best Picture in the early 80's, so i suggest checking out the movie too."
4,Interested in Greeley,"As a Highschool student I'm puzzled at this builgnsroman genera book due to the suprising maturity level that is needed to fully understand the novel to it's fullest. It has been brought to my attention by a teacher at my school that children as young as middleschool (8th and 9th grade)are reading this novel all accross America. I'm the last to think of banning a book, or to make decision's for interested young readers. At the same time, I was shocked at many idea's, settings, and language that are in my mind not suited for 13 and 14 year olds. Let these students reach the maturity level needed in thier own time,not make them rush into it."
3,A good book that was made into a great film.,"I read this after thoroughly enjoying the Redford film. The film and the novel are pretty close together - few liberties are taken. Where the book failed for me was in the writing. It was a good effort by first-time novelist Guest but one gets the impression that she spends a lot of her time saying ""MY GOD Mama look how NICE I'm writing."""
3,A good book by Judith Guest,Ordinary People by Judith Guest is a good book. By good I don't mean it's great but it's not bad and it's worth buying. This book is a teenager who struggles with life after attempting to commit suicide. He has a hard time doing this which eventually changes friendships and hurts his family. THe things I found most enjoyable about this book was his relationships with different people and how much they differ. For instance one of his best friends a psychiatrist which his dad makes him go to. Where as him and his mother just don't understand eachother. Some of the downsides are it takes a little while to get into it. It's very slow at the beggining and in the middle but then it climaxes into something big. overall I would recomend this book.
3,The movie did the novel some justice...,"I didn't like the presentation of the book, there were times when I had no idea who the speaker was until four pages later. In my opinion, the book would have achieved more power had it been written in standard form. The plot was great, but the presentation made it campy and boring. The movie was great!"
3,A poignant tale...,"I bought the book Ordinary People several years ago. I started it a couple times but this time I actually finished it. Ordinary People is a touching, psychological portrait of Conrad Jarrett, a teenager who is not only dealing with the typical stuggles of adolescence, but also dealing with his own depression and suicide attempt, the death of his brother, and his parents' conflicting attitudes towards these events. While this is not an action packed, page-turner, this book was touching, and somewhat heartbreaking. Since it is a relatively short book, I would say it is worthy of a couple days reading time."
3,"Great, but confusing","This is an amazing book! I'm in the middle of reading it, and it's really starting to come together. Unfortunately, I find it to be a very confusing style. I'm not familiar with some of the terms that Guest mentions, such as ""Platinum Plus"" and ""off myself."" I'm young, but the retro 70's style of this book is way to ""far out"" for me. I'd love an explanation. It's really emotional, too."
3,Ordinary People,"The book itself was great! It was a great story. Someone recommended it for me and I would definitely recommend it to someone else. However, I purchased it on my kindle and I noticed quite a few typos within the book which I havnt really noticed with any other book that I purchased for my kindle. I know the book is 30 years old but for $13 I feel like it shouldn't have so many typos."
1,How much do these pices weigh?,"Dear SilverSpeck, your pictures are good but your product descriptions are lacking accuracy. Here is a necklace I probably would have purchased: ""Sterling Silver Beaded Cross 16 Inch Necklace"" but your product description says it weighs ""22 pounds."" Another piece I really liked, ""Sterling Silver Designer Heart Necklace,"" weighs an unbelievable ""36.1 pounds.""Last, this lovely pink silk cord showed here weighs ""2.7 pounds."" For all the pieces I described, you have excessively heavy jewelry. I am afraid to order anything from you.I don't believe your descriptions are accurate but I can't risk buying something I'm unable to wear. Please review the descriptions for all of your products - there are inaccurate descriptions on every piece I looked at.Thanks for asking!"
2,Should've been better,"I know they were trying to go for an unique artful portrayal of Klimt, but if you don't know anything about the artist besides having seen his work, there really isn't much substance in this movie. I love all the actors, especially Malkovich being one of my favorites. But the camera angles were unnecessary and the editing was confusing. Some parts stood out as beautiful, but most left something to be desired.I think overall the atmosphere of the film does portray qualities of Klimt, the struggles he had, his temper against art critiques, and outright sexuality he possessed in private as well as throughout his work. So in that way, you can take from the movie something that adds to your experience of Klimt the Artist. But otherwise... I hate to put down a film that includes one of my favorite actors and is about one of my favorite artists, but so it is."
4,parallel between Mozart and Klimt?,The movie is a surreal and I had to look up a biography in Google to make sure it was actually about Gustav Klimt!It seem in art that if you aren't strange then no one wants your paintings? John Malkovich gives a good performance in a badly written movie.There is some nudity in this movie that is probably added in hopes that the bad script could be made up for at the box office?We see the past in the eyes of a dying man as a strange distortedkleideoscope of past memories and loves. I saw a Jackson Pollockbiographical film that was very much like this.The effort to make great artists attractive in this wayseems to me to be in somewhat bad taste.
3,CONFUSING EFFORT with Exotic tendecies and annoying riddles,"The film is interesting . But it is very hard to see the picture the director is trying to paint.Klimt is played by John Malkovich who is seemingly a mentally ill artist with exoctic leanings in art and lifestyle. The nudity is plentiful in Klimt's world which is appealing to the eye of a man. The models were very pretty .Klimt has a gift for that it seems . Unfortunately, the story from beginning to end is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces never seem to come together. The story simply isnt well told as Klimt stumbles through the world of exotic art in a confused state of mind and it makes the comprehension of the tale lacking . Malkovich is good actor . This effort reveals that again, but in the end it seems somewhat wasted on the directors vision of riddles .I dont regret watching it , but it simply hard to follow the point of it all. 3 stars today as I am in a genereous mood."
1,Opaque and Dreadful Prose,"Difficult to read this book. Many books on Buddhism are written in this odd, flowery manner. If you don't already read other books on Buddhism, you may find it disorienting."
5,"this book is great, find it!","I am italian and I have an italian edition of this book. It is really interesting because it contains a lot of historical information about how Zen came out from the meeting of different cultures. It is not boring and very informative, it also explain how zen can be applied to many life things from military to art."
4,Comprehensive book,Provides wonderful insights on Zen culture and Japanese history. A great primer to all aspects of Zen from a westerners perspective.
1,Get the 2006 Version.... this book is poor quality,"Although I absolutely LOVE this book, don't waste your money on this version. This version is poor quality (apart from the cover), and an obvious photocopy of the original work. The lack of copyright page is unsettling, and the cost of this book is almost DOUBLE that of the newer 2006 version."
1,I think I've been ripped off,"I agree w/ T. Morrey's review ""Worst publishing I have ever seen, February 7, 2005"". I haven't even read the book yet, so this isn't a review of the content but rather the quality of the ""publication"" itself. The book I received -- and paid $20 for -- appears to be a crude copy of an original publication, so far as I can tell. I very much doubt that the copy I received is true a HarperCollins publication. Looks more like a photocopy. I'll be trying to get my money back for this one."
1,Skip this book and get the 2006 edition!!,"Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!! The ""Science of Sex"" is the original(?) 1996 edition. The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, ""Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles"". Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title? Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition. One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!! Can't wait to actually read it!"
3,Paradise lost in new album,"Undoubtedly one of the best French rappers du monde, Mc solaar's new album ""Mc Solaar"" tends to be a watered down after effect of his grand last album ""paradisiaque."" While still keeping son ""groove"" his lyrics have lost the strength of his former songs and instead of being an overwhelming tempest of poesie, tend to emmulate the calm vespers after the storm. This C.D. tends to be just another title put out for profit and probably would have been better on the b-sides of Paradisiaque. After hearing this album one wonders just how many times Mc Solaar can rely on clichés (how many times can he work Pablo Escobar into his songs?) and perhaps life in the 16eme has taken away the sharp dark lyricism of his past, n'est ce pas?"
4,MC Solaar en évolution,"Après son album Paradisiaque, la barre était haute pour le rapper franais. Bien des critiques ont affirméque son nouvel album était du déjà vu et que Solaar ne pouvait plus surprendre perssonne. Pourtant, son petit dernier est en réalité une évolution de sa personnalité. Avec des textes plus matures qui demandent d'avantage de réflexion, ses détracteurs changeront d'opinions au fur et à mesure qu'ils comprendront la profondeur de ses textes. Quant à la musique, elle est de plus en plus recherchée."
2,Too Much Ego,"Let me first say that Doug Wilson's rooms are beautiful. I decided however to return the book because I really could no longer bear to read his pompous and self-congratulatory style. Firstly there are almost more contrived and posed pictures of Doug than there are interiors. Lines like ""the room ...I created was a flat out sensation"", ""you agree that I've done it again"" and ""I slyly evoked the swinging sixties era"" are almost too embarrasing to read. Where were his editors?? I not only have hundreds of interior design books on my shelves but I am an author of a design book myself so I believe I speak from experience. His beautiful and clever interiors were sadly overshadowed by his neediness and overbearing focus on himself. Again, I say where were the editors?? Doug has many gifts to share, but unless he gets himself an editor who will be brutally honest with him, I fear many others will not keep his books."
2,"Cute, but....","This is a cute book, but it's extremely fragile....Parts of mine were ripped when I received it - would never have made it through a week with my nephew. Concept a bit young for older kids, but too delicate for younger - not sure what the target age would be....."
5,Such a Fun Book,"We have The 12 Bugs of Christmas and my son loves it, so I got this one for Easter. Big hit, the pop-ups on each page are intricate and very cool. We love it!"
2,cute but broken,The book itself is very cute! Had to return it. It was sent with the binding and one of the popups broken... Still waiting for Amazon to find another one.
3,good detail but not the best,"Although I like the detail this book shows, it is not my favorite. I t not only looks old fashioned, but is geared more towards foods from the UK. We don't generally have tarts, black pudding and pork pies. I guess I should have looked more into it. Just not current and relevant enough for me."
4,Very interesting items out of clay,"Again, this was a gift for someone who has worked with polymer clay for awhile; they, as was I , were excited about the details in the food listed. I was quite amazed at the number of items in this book that one can make so between the number of different items, the details the those items and the excitement of the receiving party I would have to say - YES it's worth purchasing."
5,Making miniature food & market stalls,Inspirational!!!! Great examples & easy to follow. This is one of our favorite clay books!!!!! Photos are close up & well done. Buy it!!!!
2,Only diehard fans need this,"Clapton is God, there is no doubt about this. I can't imagine in a million years he would authorize this! My feeling is he hasn't. Other than a decent line up of songs... The quality is poor to say the least. This is why I suggest only diehard fans pick this up. We appretiate an import/bootleg copy from time to time.My only other complaint is that he even toured with Mark Knopfler... He has never done a thing for me..."
4,Excellent Performance!,"It was an excellent performance for this September night at Mt. View's Shoreline Pavilion in 1988. The tour had been in England 3 months earlier with a memorable RAH performance for Prince's Trust and the poignant Mandella's 70th birthday benefit at Wembley. The ""Journeyman"" album would be released in six months time after this show.Thank you SO MUCH for making this program available! That said, the audio/video quality of this disc is only ""fair"" and from a VHS master no doubt, but so what? Sure it would have been nice if this had been remastered to 5.1 surround sound, but the performance comes first! This is no shoddy ""bootleg."" Knopfler and Clapton are great together."
2,This is a bootleg,"This is a VHS to DVD transfer of an old, unauthorized house recording. While it is a good performance, the quality of the recording is flawed; likely, the VHS tape used was several generations off the master.More to the point, this is a bootleg. It is not authorized by Eric Clapton nor his label. No one on this disc recieves any payment from it's sale.Shame on Amazon for selling bootlegs."
4,Bootleg or not it's great.,"True the audio on this leaves a little to be desired. The audio is not ""professional"" by any means - the original source of this is the ""in house"" mix from the Shoreline Amphitheater which used it's own camera's to show the concert to the crowd - this was released as the DVD of same name.At first listen you will not like the audio, but rather then say it's bad (which I did) I LISTENED to the rest of it and whatever mistakes there are, these do not matter if you ENJOY the show.That said - I recomend this to any Clapton fan, as well as those that like Dire Straits even though this concert only features one DS song. The interplay between Eric and Marc is fun to watch and listen to."
2,Clapton; After Midnight - Live?,The audio quality of this product is mediocre. I am assuming that the problem is in the recording phase. Either that or this is a pirated copy made with inferior recording equipment. The main problem seems to be the very limited dynamic range as if a lot of compression was used to record it. I find it hard to believe that a professional recording made at a live concert can have this poor quality sound.
4,Take Me Witcha Ronnie Baker Brooks,This is a great Cd. Ronnie is a smokin guitar player.I liked the CD better than Goldigger but it is very good also. What you want to stay away from is his DVD. it is very poorly put together.His words do not match the music. It is like a early Bruce Lee movie. They made the DVD then tried to dubed the music over it.Dont waste ur money on it.
5,One of the most underrated Bluesman out there!!,This is his best cd and if you catch him live u will see what the blues is all about.....Its a shame they promote all the white blues artist but u never get to here about guys like Ronnie.....buy the cd u won't be sorry!!
2,Blues,"I saw Ronnie perform at a local club and liked what I heard. I was disappointed in the CD because it was poorly done. His voice is drowned out, the sound is uneven. His live performance was better. The songs and the music were great, it's too bad the CD was done so badly."
5,great bearing packer,great bearing packer! cant go wroung! if ur going to be repacking wheel bearing its a most have! works like a charm
5,bearing packer,This is a must for all mechanics. Keeps grease mess at bay and no more grease hand. I'm sure the wife will like that. You can grease a bearing so much quicker.
1,"Poor quality, do not buy","Purchased this bearing packer today. Used the grease gun to fill the container and when I tried to remove the end, it pulled out the grease fitting. Needless to say, screwing metal into plastic is a poor way to make something last. Poor product, would not recommend."
5,Excellent product!,"Great product from Lisle. This is far better than the Chinese crap sold by Harbor Freight and others. Lisle product are USA made and hold up. This will make your bearing packing job mess free. If you have a grease gun and use the supplied Zerk-fitted filler, you won't even get a dab on your hands."
3,Energetic crossover classical,"The first time I ever heard this group was in a truck stop restroom in Ohio. I knew immediately that this was one CD that I just had to have. I have become very interested in classical music spruced up by modern beats. I first got into this through the recordings of violinist Vanessa Mae. I used to play a string instrument, but I was a cello player, not a violin player; what makes Bond special to me is that this is a group of four string players, one of whom plays cello! The others play violin and viola.The album is energetic, taking various classical pieces and putting a mostly driving beat behind them. Nothing close to the masterpiece album ""Storm"" (by Vanessa Mae), but more exciting than Vanessa Mae's follow-up ""Subject To Change."""
3,Average,"I was awake one night and surfing as I usually do. I raced past the info-mercials and almost passed up the video to a song on this CD (Victory). It inspired me to buy the CD. Actually, I only found 2 or 3 tracks on it that I liked - the others being somewhat hard to deal with in that they sounded depressing or too grand for listening to. It's really hard to get a real handle on what the girls were trying to accomplish with this CD. So, if electro-techo is what you're into, get this CD. If you're into what real music sounds like without all the mix garbage, then don't bother."
3,"OK, but kind of like ""hooked on classics""","So, its catchy and pretty decent but after a while it starts to sound like hooked on classics. (If you remember that stuff.) I don't mind the rock beat, the electric guitar, but I can do without the disco drum machine and the pop length songs.Make sure you listen to the online samples first to make sure you like this sort of thing."
1,Travesty of Classical Music,"Call me a purist, but despite what Bond may say, they are not a classical group. Yes, they were supposedly classically trained at a conservatory and are ""talented"" (the use of the word is rather subjective), but they obviously do not need any of that training or talent in this cd. It seems like a monkey with some high-tech synthesizers and a recording studio could put out this cd. I'm not saying I don't enjoy techno, but don't fuse classical music and techno. To me this marriage not only sounds really crappy, it's also a travesty of classical music written to have more depth and emotion than Bond remixes it to have, and it is just really bad techno music. Some may say, it successfully ""bonds"" the two genres of music. In my opinion, it achieves nothing at all except bad music. P.S. May I recommend Sarah Brightman if you are looking for New Ageish/Classical music."
4,A very upbeat kind of classical crossover,"There are well over a hundred reviews on the CD page for this album, with widely varying evaluations. Some people hate it (including the Amazon editor), and some love it. My wife would hate the strong dance beat, but I appreciate the addition of rhythm instruments to Classical Crossover, even if it is a synthesizer. In the case of ""Born"" the beat seems to dominate the music a bit too much, but some people will like that. So if you want to listen to a fast-paced string quartet with a strong dance beat, this is your ticket."
4,Don't Know Much About . . .,"Compared to the editorial above, I know nothing about the music production industry. All I know is that I enjoy listening to vibrant string quartets, and Bond makes me feel good. I don't care a twit about who wrote the music, who is actually playing, or if the players happen to be beautiful or not. I have a CD player in my car that has 12 CDs stored in it. For some reason I keep coming back to CD number 4 (Bond), particularly track 11. What can I say? I don't know much about music, but I know what I like."
3,It's OK!,"I was hoping/expecting a little more. The ""techo-fusion"" doesn't get pulled off quite as well as Vanessa Mae and there's a shortage of classical. I can understand why it was moved to the pop charts.So right now there could be a tendency for them to be viewed as pretty women in a promoted/over-hyped band/quartet. I fear it will be hard to support an arguement against this.However, they are musicians and have these degrees and studio/touring experience, etc. so I'm not writing them off so quickly. If they put some more direction and production into their next recording and show a little bit more orchestration and soloing than skin, there's a chance. If not I'm putting their CDs on E-bay."
1,Born should have stayed in the womb,"It's a bad idea to take classical pieces and put canned percussion behind them and try to sell them as fusion music. This album was just boring with the same old ""fifth of Beetoven"" flavor."
2,Techno Pop with Fiddles,"Well, the ladies are pretty. Moreso with maekup, however; 2 are fairly ordinary without the glamour makeover.These lasses can play, but the arrangements here are soulless techno-beats.I won't give up on them, but I hope they find some more lyrical music. This stuff is fine to ice-skate by, but I find no aural beauty in mixing synsthesizers with real strings and that horrid synthetic beat.The music is neither classical nor symphonic nor orchestral. It pales, sadly, in relation to earlier failed attempts to make classical cool, such as ""Switched-On Bach.""I am troubled that such capable players would regard this as worthy music. Even at the tender age of 24, they should know better.I admire the try. Try again girls, but find some music to play."
1,born,This album was too far out for me. Very disappointed.Will give away to the first person that wants it.
1,It's garbage I tell you!,If they wanted to be the Spice Girls they should have joined the Spice Girls. This is the worst garbage I have heard in decades. This is a collection of collisions between Yanni and Enigma - the victims were pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. I am glad that I now have a new coaster for my coffee and a new jewel case for one that my daughter sat on in the car.
2,"How to make money with ""classical"" music out of school...","This album is not bad, but it didn't reach me the way I thought it would... The ladies are good players I'm sure, and the music is not so bad either, but I got tired of those series of harmonics sequence without a melody, almost always starting with the same string only introduction, followed by an upbeat backing of techno bass and rythm. For me, it's better to stick to the original form of either classic, and if you want disco or techno, get Daft Punk or the Chemical Bros...!"
5,One of the best I've ever heard,"Regardless of the negative reviews of this album, I,as a 58 year old man find this music so inspiring and so absolutely love the music that it gives heart to the ability to improve and inhance the love of classical music. To those of a younger genre, note that this music is an enhancement to the traditional classical. Hear it, listen to it and enjoy the pleasure that obviously these young musicians enjoy bringing to you with their upbeat renditions on some of the most beautiful classics. 5 stars for these kids and I hope their future sails to the stars!!! Good luck and God bless!!!"
4,New and refreshing,"Although I can not say I am in love with every piece on the CD, they are certainly new and refreshing. Upbeat with a slight clasical twist. Well, worth adding to your collection."
3,Should be in any Bond fan's collection,"Not as good as their Shine cd, a few songs sound downright crazy like some spaceship music, but the good songs make it worth putting in the collection."
4,"Fun to listen to, but...","... For my money, the best at fusing classical and pop together is still Vanessa Mae. Bond is a great group, and this CD is very easy to listen to. It's very straightforward and balanced, and if you're curious about classical this is a good way to make the transition.That being said, Vanessa Mae is a virtuoso, someone who pushes the genre far beyond just mixing drum bears and classical instruments. Her music might take a little longer to get used to, but the differences between Bond and her are clear. Start with the Violin Player, and work from there. Bond is good addition to any collection, but Vanessa Mae is a cornerstone for people who love classical and pop."
2,Sudoku - lots of puzzles - not much challenge,"The main problem is that the difficulty range is very small and the assigned difficulties don't seem to have much to do with how hard the puzzles are. One error that I found - Beginner #52 has multiple solutions. But there are about 207 puzzles, which is a lot - and the size is decent - not tiny newspaper images."
5,Simply Awesome!,Brett takes time to talk about everything! I felt like I was actually there at the workshop ( and I really wanted to be). Great for all as Brett talks about the business side as well as the creative side.
3,GERTRUDE IS AN ACQUIRED TASTE,"Having heard so much about Ms. Stein I thought to try her out.Like, to round out my literary understanding. I tried, I floundered,I tried again a few times. Then opened Ellroy[[ASIN:0679403930Blood's A Rover]] to calm down..~ GS is incomparable, (for me) inscrutable. But as a fanof things different, differently done, well, I can say shecertainly is.I'll try Ms. Stein again sometime, meantime there is a worldof scrutable books out there to read."
2,2 Micz From Da Dogg,"Cali Kings has got a couple of good tracks... But there wasn't really much done 2 the tracks besides shortening em and puting a little bit of work... I personally think the album was rushed.... If they put a bit more work into it, it would have been Dope... The DJz are could easily get 4 mics they have 5 mic potential.... but they need 2 work more...."
1,Completely Unusable,"For all I know, this might be the best Russian language program ever invented. But I'll never know it--I could not for the life of me figure out how to use this software. There was no instruction booklet, and when I opened the program, I simply had no idea what to do. I clicked on an icon or two, and my computer started jabbering at me in Russian. I didn't have the foggiest idea what the program wanted me to do--repeat, type something, or whatever. It was completely unusable.Lest anyone think I'm computer illiterate, I'm a 28-year-old doctoral student who was using gopher and mosaic to surf the Internet before Netscape Navigator existed and long before this website was even a twinkle in Jeff Bezos's eye.Purchase at your own risk."
1,Nightmare..again,"I'm a native Russian speaker and a lang.teacher. What really amuses me is how many useless expensive courses are out there..Russian is one of the most difficult languages in the world with a complicated grammar that means you should first take some private lessons/ group beginners course with a teacher, preferably native speaker or a bok, like ""Russian for Beginners"".Ok, you bought this course and know now how to ask where the bus station is. Will you understand the answer?"

What really amuses me is how many useless expensive courses are out there..Russian is one of the most difficult languages in the world with a complicated grammar that means you should take some private lessons/ group beginners course with a teacher, preferably native speaker.Ok, so you know now how to ask about the bus station direction. Will you understand the answer?"
2,"Not terrible, but definitely not good.","Not terribly expensive, but still not worth it. The Rosetta Stone software is far superior, albeit costly. If you're on a budget and MUST have software and are willing to put up with a klunky interface and poor quality, buy this. Otherwise, save your money."
2,"Nice, but not my style...","I find this system too confusing for me. The explanations of the cases are too mind boggling for me to understand what it is that they are talking about. The voice part of the software is nice, however, it's definitely unreliable when it comes to telling you how well you are at pronouncing a word. I should know; just for fun, I said a word in english and it gave me a WOW for my ""russian"" pronunciation. What a joke! The movie ""The Adventures of John Stevenson,"" although incredibly entertaining and fun to watch, didn't do a thing when it came to teaching me the language. I'm more of a visual learner and I prefer to be taught a language through pictures. This system just didn't help me at all."
2,Where is the original track listing?,This isnt the original tracklisting at all...I have all of the original LPs but ive been looking for them on cd...I guess my search continues...
2,Vol. 1 is all wrong,"Not to knock this set, but it is my understanding that vol.1 in this one has been drasticly altered from what I remember it used to be when I was younger. I dont remember any of the songs listed here to be on the og.(great songs none the less)what happened to ""LEE GOOFED"" ""HE'LL BE BACK"" ""MAKING ENDS MEAT"" etc."
2,Booo,Why did they chang this so much I own all 12 RECORDS of this and it is not the same. They just should have added more volumes than Butcher the origanls.
2,"Its ok, but i would like to fine the original vol.'s",i agree with another reviewer at of the vol's are totally wrong for example vol is totally wrong the vo. has songs i've never herad they left out all the best like somebody please . oppertunity n so on if any one has the orinal copys please email me the list i would really apperciate it
5,Eastside oldies collection,"The CDs were great! Unfortunately, the packaging wasn't so good. All cd cases arrived broken. During shipment, the box was either dropped or something heavy was placed on it. With the cases being plastic, I would recommend the box be placed inside bubble wrap to prevent any damage to CDs. We had to replace all cases which is unnecssary after purchasing the product at full price. Great music and glad that none of the actual CDs were broken."
1,Piece of junk,This item was defective from the get-go. All procedures were followed to ensure that it would work (researched on the Internet. It now sits on the workbench thick with grease and unable to be used.Not worth the trouble....
2,I was a tad disappointed,"Not that I have anything against my man Eggers, you know. I think that his initial embarkment in a polemical discourse against Bajema's counter-point, ""Ode to the I-Ching"" had its merits. Unfortunately, Eggers' prose is not subtle enough, and makes his vendetta against the Bolivian warlords who extradited him during the ""Breadfruit Rebellion"" too apparent. I mean, this was 27 years ago, during Eggers' Daffodil period. It's time for him to put the bulljive aside and let by-gones be by-gones. I also was a bit confused by his paean to Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler. What do Rumplemintz really have to do with Geezer's derivations from Telemann's lute fugue in A minor? Go figure. Go ask Bajema."
4,An excellent Insight in Einstein life,"This is quite a good book about his life and history. Although, if you are looking for an explanation of his theories, this wouldn't be it. It's very easy to read and has a very good insight"
3,Not too bad... however not what I was looking for.,"I am pretty much in agreement with the fellow amazon reviewer - herrdirektor's impression of this book. It is a very well researched biography. However, the book looms away from Einstein, the man and focuses more into his works. Brian writes of his scientific researches in great detail and in a manner which may not be too convenient for any reader unrelated to the scientific field. I was particularly looking for a book which gave me a glimpse inside the mind of the philosopher/scientist. With its prime focus on his career, this book fails the philosopher that Einstein was. I feel that those philosophies played a very important role and maintaining his mass popularity even after decades of his death. This missing element may disappoint some of the readers."
2,Tedious detail,"I love biography, and good biography does contain details. But this book's detail is tedious in content as well as tedious in its writing style. There is no attempt at literary art. It's descriptions sound juvenile. I strained mentally to get used to the style but to add to that the small and cramped print in the book caused me to give up after a few pages."
1,Not for the Graphically Oriented,"I bought the book based on the one review which gave it raving reviews. Unfortunately if you are graphically oriented like most designers, then this is not for you. If you like to read how to do stuff, then I guess it's fine. Also be advised the few graphics in the book are all MS Windows palettes which may irk Macintosh users."
1,very basic and little design use,"not a very useful illustrator 10 book for me, the examples are very basic im afraid, and theres little material of challenge to an already designer, i was hoping for more."
1,Residents at Attica Prison Could Have Done Better,"Of all the film versions of plays by William Shakespeare this has got to be the worst. I agree with one reviewer that you could have gotten better performances from people off the street. I hope all these actors donated their time to this film for there isn't one worthy of a penny in remuneration. Cuts to the text had no justification. And the special effects. Zounds!What special effects! A plastic kneck brace spewing forth blood; a latex head chopped in half; a rubber baby doll impaled on a stake (not even in the original text);and more! It's not even a ""good"" bad movie."
1,"Add the Andronicus, lose the movie.","This is NOT high quality shakespeare. Putting this next to Titus (directed by Julie Taymor) makes one cringe in embarrassment. Admittedly: Ms. Taymor had the advantages of professional actors, professional musicians, and professional support people. But spoiled as I am, I rather expect that from a movie. I didn't receive it from this one.I've always thought that even bad Shakespeare was good. But the thinking, in this case, didn't make it so."
5,some people just don't get it-- this flick is awesome,"The people talking trash on this have some axe to grind, or just haven't seen it. This movie is the crazyest thing I've seen in along time. Its a better telling of the play that the hollywood turkey, and yet its also filled with cult-movie insane violence.I won't give away spoilers, but theres a stomping scene thats worth the cost alone, and each death is a grisly classic. Its really something to watch over and over, and then go out and beat the heck out of someone (just kidding). Eggheads and snobs may not go for it. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!"
3,Interesting,"By interesting I mean the reviews, not the movie. I am teaching a Shakespeare class at a local high school in NC and was doing a little research when I came across this video. Before I purchased the thing, I wanted to read what others said. I find it interesting that most of the positive reviewers live in Florida, where I believe the movie was made. My class' focus is on Shakespeare as performance. I have used other ""bad"" adaptations in class and found them most effective. Students actually enjoy watching AND criticizing a bad movie. It leads to quite a bit of discussion on changes and what Shakespeare may have had in mind. I might do the same with this. I personally find the blood and guts attractive. My class of eighteen--most of them are pretty ""cool"" kids--might throw up. Still debating...and thanks for the reviews. I still don't know whether to trust the Florida reviewers."
1,The bard is turning in his grave,"Oh the pain...oh the remorse...oh what a disgrace. This movie is not a good cult classic, or is it acceptable as a high school play. If you will note a white glimmer in the actor's eyes you will understand that they were reading their lines rather than acting them. I believe this the total budget must have been $5.00. Please Mr. Shakspeare forgive them for they no not what they do."
1,Titus Andronicus: An Absolute Insult to Shakespeare,"This film was a travesty. I have never seen a more pathetic attempt at Shakespeare in my life. Even in high school the reading of the play by mear students mangled as it was, exhibited more vitality. Half of the time the ""actors"" (an insult to the profession I know) couldn't announciate the lines clearly. To add insult to injury, the background music was more annoying than effectual. After having wasted both the time and money for this inapt VHS tape I feel I should be given compesation. Since this is unlikely I'll have to settle for warning others not to make the mistake of bothering with this piece of trash. I can not in good conscious give this anything above a ""negative star""."
1,The Worst Book I Ever Read,"I would give this ""0"" stars if I could. The premise is exciting but Ambrose does not supply one iota of science as to how it might happen. It is make-believe at its most elementary. I couldn't wait to finish reading it because I was so bored."
4,Very cool...,"James Bond in Matrixland. If you want a plotline spoonfed to you, this is not a book for you. A very nice ride through David Ambrose's vivid imagination. Four stars instead of five because the ""false memory"" gimmick seemed to close out almost every other chapter in the second half of the book. This is the first Ambrose book I've read, but I'll be on the lookout for his earlier works."
5,True Heart and Soul,"Thinking how quiet the streets of New Orleans are after Hurricane Katrina, I wanted a CD that captured the heart and soul of New Orleans. Dr. White and the musicians in his group (all New Orleans natives) really do capture the true spirit of New Orleans jazz on this recording. The blending of different styles of jazz combined with Dr. White's superb clarinet make for enjoyable listening over and over. The quality and clarity of the recording is excellent--many of the other New Orleans jazz CDs are older remastered versions of analog recordings and lack the crisp sound found on this cd. This is a real gem!"
4,It's a collecters item,"Call me a dork! I just paid 50 bucks for this little thing. I have been a big fan of the resident evil games for a long time, and I thought it would be cool to have this little piece of art work. Yes it works as a controler, but I would get a little messed up using it. I would recomend this to the fans, but not for someone looking for great control.The blood splater design is one of a kind and made differently for every controler. It comes with a nice little display case. You might just want to keep it in there, and use your regular controler."
5,"A fan from Garden Grove, Ca","An excellent rock-pop album. Rosario forgets about her flamenco style for a while and adds a touch of rock to her latest album. ""Es Lo Que Es,""Relajarme"", ""Quiero Querer"", and ""Puedo Darte Todo"" are my favorites. ""Nada Mejor"" is a wonderful dedication to her daughter. Its a shame that no radio station plays her here in L.A. She also includes two unique ballads-""Lo Siento Mi Amor"" and ""Cuanto Tengo"" that could easily become hits. Buy it, you won't regret it."
4,Excellent broad anthology of Chinese Chan (Zen) poetry,"Yes, I'm picky and had a quarrel with the introduction's reference to religious institutions without a recognition of the interplay between Nestorian Christianity and Chan Buddhism but such a point is of no interest to the general reader. The book is a wonderfully broad selection of poets and styles including poets with a strong Taoist bent - a happy addition illustrating the coexistence of multiple religious traditions within single individuals. There are differing styles of translation - from the more literal to the more poetic - but only two poems in the entire book that leave me wanting to read the original Chinese because the translation seems too free. The book as a whole is a marvelous example of the force of poetry that is rooted in experience rather than metaphor; as such it should be read by those without a specific interest in Buddhism.My criticism? Too many poets are represented by only one or two poems."
1,Winged Migration - the Book,"Rarely disappointed in Amazon - but this item was shipped from a book distributor. I paid full price for this book, but the item received was moderately damaged.... It might have been satisfactory if I were purchasing it for myself, but I bought it as a gift, and was embarassed because it looked like it was ""damaged goods"", and indeed, it was! Repeated phone calls, Voice Messages, and emails to the distributor went absolutely ignored!"
2,Boring,"There's nothing particularly special about this album. If they weren't singing in Spanish, most listeners would just say La Oreja de Van Gogh is fluff pop in the Cranberries mode."
3,honest,"I don't like tracks 5,7,9 but i think the lead singers voice sounds good on this compared to other albums."
5,"You can't beat the name, but you sure can buy the album!","There is still hope for pop and rock music from Spain! La Oreja de Van Gogh, though fresh out of college, sound as smooth as if they had been playing together for years. This quintet from San Sebastian, Spain exhibit the raw talent and the drive to become hugely successful in Latin pop/rock, and their first album will prove very difficult for them to top! Amaia, the lead singer, has a voice exquisitely suited to both harder-edged rock songs and the softer side of pop, and the band manages to blend both sounds perfectly in amazing songs like ""El 28"" and ""La estrella y la luna"". Their lyrics are both simple and meaningful, definitely not bubble-gum pop by any stretch, and also extremely catchy. I am very excited to hear the sound of this new group from northern Spain, and I hope their influence becomes more widespread throughout the Spanish music world. Can't wait to hear their second album!"
3,A bit disappointing,"I tracked this book down and bought it, and as much as I love the big book, 500 Master Games of Chess, I found this shorter supplement a disappointment. It's not that it's not as good as the first one; it's just that it isn't really necessary if you have the big one. The problem is that the authors did not really bring the opening canon up to date. The original work suffered from a lack of many modern openings: the Pirc, Modern, King's Indian, many variations of the Sicilian, etc. The new one does not remedy this shortfall, although I assumed it would, because it was written in the '50s. Instead, it basically adds new games that were played in the old openings. The games and annotations are of equal instructive quality to the ""500 Games"" book, but, again, it seems that an opportunity was missed...."
4,sound track,"The music sounds ""Muddy"" on my system----not clear like the movie DVD. Could what I bought be a copy of a copy? That is what it sounds like. It was sent from ArgentinaMaybe that is the best you can get from those old recordings...Still fun to listen to."
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Mediocre","The Good: Tarantino as usual has put together an awesome collection of tunes. The man has impeccable taste in music. This soundtrack is also, to my knowledge, the only place you can get the awesome Jack Nitzsche track ""The Last Race"" from the campy 60s flick Village Of The Giants, which is notable for having a giant toga wearing Beau Bridges shimmering. This track is worth the cost of the CD alone, but....The Bad: The track is ruined by engine sounds overlaid from the movie. Just seems to be on this track, so it makes me think it's there to cover up some imperfections in the source recording. I hope the excellent surf-rock soundtrack Nitzsche did for Village of the Giants gets a proper release one day. As of now, this was the best I could find.The mediocre: Tarantino's films of late, but hey, ya win some ya lose some. He's still got a few great movies left in him I think."
3,Not the best...,"Well, I can't say this is the best Tarantino soundtrack, the assembly of songs is not very homogeneous, and I don't like them all. Some are quite good though like the one from Ennio Morricone, and the Coasters."
1,Not 100% Surf!!,Not all of the titles on this CD are surf music titles. BEWARE. This is a soundtrack to a movie (where it should be properly listed) This is not a 100% surf disk.
4,Great Soundtrack! It's a Must Buy!,"Whatever your feelings regarding the film ""Deathproof"", it's already more than obvious that the soundtrack to this film is superb.Even while watching the movie I was impressed by how much I enjoyed the quality of the music in the film. What they chose to include seemed to fit the mood and feel of this movie perfectly.I was like ""man I getta get this soundtrack!"" and very few movie scores really move me say that. Also usually as a rule I don't buy many soundtracks to movies.This is by far and wide a superior soundtrack than ""Planet Terror"" for sure, no doubt about it. Odds are most of you liked ""Planet Terror"" better than the movie ""Deathproof"" But ""Deathproof"" evens things out by having the better soundtrack of the two by miles. At least I think so, hopefully you do too."
4,"As always, Tarantino's soundtracks are great companions to his films.","Like the movies themselves, the soundtrack albums made from Quentin Tarantino's movies are always a great mix of quirky, edgy, and exciting, and the soundtrack to ""Death Proof"" (Tarantino's half of the ""Grindhouse"" double feature) is no exception. Comprised of songs you probably never heard before and little known covers of songs you HAVE heard (along with Tarantino's usual sprinkling of dialogue excerpts from the film), ""Death Proof, the soundtrack"" will entertain you with its 16 bracing selections. I had a lot of fun with this and I bet you will, too."
2,soundtrack,the soundtrack without the action of the movie didn't fit. i was not impressed with the songs as much as i was the movie.........
1,"Haven't received order, being ignored by seller.","Haven't recieved order of Deathproof soundtrack as of late. Have corresponded with seller, but I haven't received any feedback. I have tried to communicate three times already. It was due on May 5. This is bad business practices."
1,His worst best of movie,put together create a mood without visuals . Maybe it will work With the Movie of which i am sure it will ...
2,"good songs, LOW quality","There are some great songs on here, but they all sound terrible! Tons of digital artifacts and distortion. I've listened on several CD players and it always sounds the same: low quality, high distortion. Totally distracting for me... ruins the disc. A disappointment."
3,recommended with reservations,"I support the general comments made so far. I did the same as another reviewer - thought maybe different sets of speakers would sound better so played the CD on several systems. Tarantino's music selection, as usual, is excellent, however the actual quality of the tracks is inconsistent. Also, did not care for the choice of dialogues; they were not unique/distinctive enough to highlight."
4,Lap Dancing,"The Coasters ""Down in Mexico"" and the others are very good. I bought it for 3 songs and ended up enjoying the whole CD, I think you will also."
5,an excellent sympathetic and laudatory account of akhenaton,"I have read half a dozen books on Akhenaton and I must say that this was the most ""feel good"" account of this unusual pharoah. While other modern writers have recently been on the attack against Akhenaton,(the revenge of Amun?) disparaging his thinking and accomplishments, this author offers a thoroughly thought provoking viewpoint, leaving the reader with a strong desire to have met the pharoah himself. The author is a throwback to the earlier , more sympathetic-to-Akhenaton-school of Breasted , and Arthur Weigall. This writer recommends Weigall's ""Life and Times of Akhenaton "" as your next read after ""Son of the Sun"". In summary, a wonderful book, written with a quiet passion ,which lingers long after the reading is done."
3,"Great product, loose tip","I love this product and love the way it feels and smell after my hair dresser used it on me. WIsh the container was not as cheap as they made it. I still have a full spray bottle, but the tip is not working and made me so disappointed. But great product if i can take it out!"
3,Memorias del Porvenir es lo mejor de esta banda,"No es tan excelente como Memorias del Porvenir, pero no es una perdida total de tiempo y dinero. Memorias tiene todos sus mas importantes exitos, y en mi opinion no hace falta comprar este disco. Basta com Memorias y Simplemente Lo Mejor no es necessario. Las canciones que a mi me gustan estan en Memorias, y muchas de Simplemente a mi no me gustan. Son muy diferentes a lo que recordaba de esta banda. De vez en cuando pongo este disco, pero Memorias Del Porvenir es uno de mis favoritos de todos los tiempos."
1,Absolutely frustrating...,"I purchased the French-style Sil-Pin a little over a year ago and was thrilled at its ability to work through the stickiest of dough....at least until it snapped in two five minutes into the job. Furious that such an expensive rolling pin couldn't handle something as basic as chilled dough I wrote an email to the company to voice my complaint. They were very polite and quickly sent me a replacement. I chalked up my experience to a defective pin and went happily on my way...until the replacement snapped in two as well. Maybe only the French-style pins are this fragile, but the next time I buy a rolling pin it won't be a Sil-pin."
3,Syfy screenplay,"First read from this author, probably because I didnt pin my hopes too high that I enjoyed this book. He's no Michael Crichton but it was entertaining and very over the top. No scientific details as to the how (there was an explanation to it, just accept it) but I did at least learn the scientific name for the RIFA (will google just make sure it wasnt made up)and considering how brief an intro the character build up was not bad at all. This would make an ideal Syfy bug movie, so don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy it."
5,There's a really good story here,"Another good book from Jeff Strand--one of my favorite writers. The story here is great and, after the necessary blood and gore, the plot actually develops into something quite interesting. I know Strand's a great writer, but I was really surprised with how well he strung this story together. I don't know what I expected out of the book before I started it, but the plot was much stronger than I expected, which is a really good thing.My one complaint is that point of view jumps happen A LOT in this story. It works because more often than not that person's point of view is exterminated by the ants eating them. So even though there are ten or more people who the story centers on, in the end, there's only a couple POVs that actually matter. A lesser writer wouldn't have been able to pull this off, but Strand is extremely gifted."
5,great read!,"as a fan of the old black and white b movies about an assortment of creatures from ants to octopus, i loved this book. it was a fast read as it wasn't too detailed and was enjoyable. i couldn't put it down, as a matter of fact, and was disappointed that it had to end. i would love a sequel! while i realize everyone's taste in books is different, and of course, this ain't shakespeare, if you love the old creature features like i do, this is right up your alley. i will definitely check out anything else by this author. i don't know if he has anymore like this, but i will be watching for more."
3,I got 2 little hobbits and a microphone...,"Is it just coincidence that this obscure late 60's psych band's catalog is being reissued on CD at the same point in time that the ""Lord Of The Rings"" film trilogy is ramped up and fresh in everyone's mind? Oh, perhaps.(Maybe we'll finally get that Wizzard box set!) Cynicism aside, fans of the sitar and the lava lamp will probably get a kick out of Gandalf's debut, nicely packaged and remastered by the collector-friendly Sundazed label. The arrangements are (of course) a tad ""dated"" and chock full of the requisite cosmic peace love and acid lyrics, but it should please collectors of the genre. The band's sound falls somewhere between ""A Question Of Balance"" era Moody Blues and say, oh, early Bubble Puppy, with maybe a dash of the Association here and there. Not essential, but quite listenable."
1,Sounds without substance,"After repeated listening to both the concerto and the Autumn Gardens, my personal response is I wish there were more music in the music. In the recorded interview, Ashkenazy sounds like a polite but clearly disappointed buyer trying to glean any bit of insight the composer might give to this empty effort. But, Rautavaara talks around it and attempts to cloak the lack of musical substance in some sort of spiritual argument. Good try at a save, but the sales pitch quickly dissipates when you go back to the music and just listen to what was written. I don't begrudge a composer making a good living, but I hope that Mr. Ashkenazy didn't pay a great deal for this concerto."
1,"A novel, a fictional book, not truth at all","All this book is made of lies. There are no ""navaja fighting"" schools in Spain. I am from Spain, I have trained for more than 30 years in many martial arts including some western, and I have no information about that. It sounds extrange that Mr. Loriega (not a spanish guy) arrives Spain and finds easily what many martial artists from Spain don't know it exists!If you change the name of the Spanish master by ""Joda"" and ""Navaja"" by ""laser sable"", and ""Sevilla"" for ""Dagobah"", then you get ""Mr. Loriega"" is ""Luke Skywalker"". I think he would like to, and that is the reason of the book. Mr. Loriega has fully invented the story, just to pack it together with his Manual del Baratero translation and make himself some kind of Spanish Martial Arts Master.Anyway, the book can be read as a novel, and you can enjoy reading it as if you read a book about Luke Skywalker learning laser sable fighting in his Jedi Academy. Both are fiction in the same level."
2,A sample only,"I'm not too sure what the point of this book really was. It is more like a phamphlet than an actual book. It gives a brief introduction to Spanish knife fighting, but it's difficult to tell if it is truly authentic and historically accurate. It brevity certainly meant that it is lacking in information. Even for a casual reader, it is a somewhat unsatisfying book. For those who are trying to find out more about the Spanish use of knives, it is definitely disappointing."
3,"high on history, low on technique","If your intent is to read a knife fighting manual for self defense purposes then do not read this book. Mr. Loriega does an excellent job at describing the history of the spanish fighting arts and he obviously knows a fair amount about spanish culture. Sadly the book comes up short when it comes to demonstrating knife fighting techniques as the few techniques that are shown are very basic and can be found in most self-defense manuals. Read this book if you are a spanish history buff, but not if you are interested in using a knife for self defense."
1,a fake,"if you want to buy this book it's your chioce, but you have to knwo first that the ""Sevillian school of edge weapons"" is near the bus stop to Kripton...it has NEVER existed. i know what i said becouse ***i've been living in seville more than 12 years...***it's said on the back cover of the book:""in seville, as troughout many parts of spain, one can find training halls whereedge-weapons combats is practiced today as it was 300 years ago""oh, yes...and if you go to central park in new york and look beetwen trees you can find a native americans'community living as they do 328 years ago...i don't know why loriega decided to create the fantasy about sevillian steel, perhaps he needed an exotic title for his book.if you want to buy this book, it's your money and you can do whattever you want whit it. the book can have interesting techniques but as it's said in spain ""te dan gato por liebre"" (literally: they give you a cat instead of a rabbit)"
5,GREAT,"Great song, great remixes. This song is at #1 in singles SALES chart in Europe for 8 straight weeks. For all the Mariah Carey fans: SALES means that someone has gone to a shop and paid for a record, much different from airplay wich means that the company is paying for getting the record spinning in the radio."
2,Blair Witch Project Movie,Hi i am writing about the movie of the blair witch someone i know who works in a video store said that when the movie comes out they are suppose to cut out the ending. i am thinking about buying but if they do that i dont think i will be getting please could you tell me if that is true or not thanks
5,I read it in 2 hours!,"What a good book. For both my husband and I to read it in 2 hrs or so, sure says something. I love this type of book...suspensful and makes you think. I had to go right out and get the movie that night. The pictures show alot of the movie fottage, but the diary of Heather is the killer in the book. That's what did it for me. I would highly recommend this book, however, until today I thought it was real! So, keep in mind, when I read the book and saw the movie, I beleived it had all actually happened as they said. The killer for me was the part about what it meant in the house when a person was standing facing the wall! Then I saw the last scene in the movie! WOW! Chilling! You'll have to read and watch to find what I mean. Freaked me out! A great book."
4,Be reasonable; suspend disbelief.,"The power of storytelling, no matter the medium, is for the audience to suspend their disbeliefs for a certain amount of time in order to enter the storyteller's narrative.The book, expanding on the film, is treated as a dossier: A complilation of events surrounding the dissapearence of three university students while on assignment to create a documentary on an American legend. From backgound reports filed by the Burkittsville Sheriffs Department, a private investigation agency, newspaper articles, and interviews with family and friends of the missing students, the dossier compiled by D.A. Stern gives those that were interested in the film a better understanding of what indeed happened--and will let us, the audience, make up our minds as to the circumstances of three very unlucky people."
5,A Real Witch Speaks,"Speaking as a real witch, I really enjoyed both this book and the movie. It was fun."
1,Tedious drivel,"Oh, I'm so very, very, *yawn* scared. Hey, wanna buy some teeth? Like, the movie was so cool, but in the book there's no, like, screaming or nothing. Helloo?! I need screaming."
4,The bad thing about the book is you don't hear childeren.,"Real or not this movie WILL have you up all night. I seen the movie with a pal of mine .As we were walking to the car,he said the movie didn't scare him.I think he was expecting to see the witch or some kind of scene that makes you jump out of your seat.It must have been a dear he hear not childeren laughing.A few days later he tells me he hasn't been able to sleep well.I said thats the scary part when you are alone at night and have to sleep with your T.V. on.The book was great , it was the icing on the cake."
1,Cr***y book for a cr***y movie,"I like most of you were caught up in the Blair Witch hype, so Iwent out and got this book. I didnt open it until after I saw themovie, but after seeing the movie I felt like an idiot for buying the book. The movie was the biggest load of cr** I've ever seen. They shoulda called it 3 people out it the woods yelling and swearing for 2 hours. The book was just as stupid.PS: And for all you people who are saying that The Blair Witch Project is so origional, go rent the movie Cannibal Holocost and say that."
1,I feel I was suckered!,"I went to see the movie and it really intrigued me. As many others I was led to believe that although the movie was fake, the story was true. I ordered the book that evening. I again was very intrigued and finished it a few hour after receiving it in the mail. I was talking to a friend about the movie and the book, and she pointed out the disclaimer that I easily overlooked. It is ALL fiction. The story is very scary, but most of the fear is from thinking the story is true."
3,Been to the website? You've read most of the book.,"After reading the reviews listed here, it seems that some fans of the film (myself included) had unanswered questions at the end of the movie. This book won't completely satisfy that curiosity (unless the reader hasn't been to the website). It's not a bad book, though. One bad thing, however, is the negative assumption about Americans the ""Reader from London"" wrote on September 7, 1999. It is doubtful that ""only Americans could believe that any part of it was true or feel the need to tell others in capital letters that it isn't."" Remarks like these are rude and unnecessary. Should an American presume, due to the observation made by this ""Reader from London,"" that only the English would be so disdainful and insolent as to make such a judgment? No, because any US citizen making that presumption would only be sinking to the level of prejudice exhibited by one narrow-minded British resident."
5,cool book and movie,cool movie cool book if you have read the book you have to see the movie cool efects weird ending but you will find out how they made and though of the blair witch-samer jizi
2,Ripoff,"Even today I'm a fan of TBWP and so when this book was released right after the movie, I rushed out to get it. What's in this ""dossier"" is mostly filler to pad a book someone was trying to get out before the popular buzz about this inventive work of cinematic art cooled off. There is basically nothing new in here and even the timeline about Blair and the events that have scarred its history are available for free off the film's promotional website. It was garbage like this that helped start up the backlash against what is one of the spookiest movies ever made."
3,Interesting.,"There's nothing ""new"" in this book that is not already on the website. Of course if you can't view the website then this book is a must. It has Heather's journal entries in it and overall is a good source of interviews and information about the legend/story. I'm dissapointed by the poor quality of paper they used in the book/I think they could have made some creepy black glossy pages to really integrate the mystery for the fans of the movie.I am satisfied with my purchase."
2,Makin' a buck,"The Blair Witch Project is not a very good movie. It's mostly about 3 people lost in the woods, getting more and more angry at each other and their situation. The only variable is this ""legend"" about a witch, which we have no reason to believe in, no matter what sounds are heard at night. This is all a good idea, and a neat marketing gimmick, but the movie is, even at 80-something minutes, mostly a bore. This book is just another product of the idea, and if they you like the movie a lot that's great, but just don't pay full price for this garbage book."
2,I was disapointed in the format of the book.,"In my opinion, the book itself would be more frightning as a novel instead of a collection of interviews, and newspaper clippings. The book barely holds your attention. Not to mention, it can be a bit confusing when it comes to who is talking when, and so on. The diary pages were the only interesting element of the book. Needless to say, the book has discouraged me from seeing the movie."
3,Great Movie but Dissappointing Dossier,"This Movie is one of those that will stay in the minds of people who adore horrors for a long time. Suggestive Nightmarish Horror that captured all the great things that are needed for a horror movie. However, the dossier was very dissappointing, Not meaty and no heavy reading involved, I read it in an hour and afterwards just felt cheated. I think a more indepth, descriptive dossier would have been fitting for such a great movie."
4,Blair Witch Background,"The book pretty much covers the same material as the Curse of the Blair Witch, the TV special that aired on Sci-Fi. The background information presented here is suitably detailed and creepy."
4,Better than the movie,"Very interesting book. Much better than the movie because it doesn't jiggle. Seriously, the book filled in a lot of holes for me. It was MUCH much better than the movie."
3,"Beautiful book, but not for healthy eaters","Every recipe in this book looks beautiful and delicious. I enjoyed reading all of the author's ""stories"" about each recipe. I haven't tried any recipes yet simply because nearly every one uses lots of butter, cream, etc. I'm no health nut, but these are not everyday recipes for those of us even reasonably concerned with healthy eating. I would only use this book for cooking for special occasions like showers, parties, and holidays. One other thing--a few recipes in this book are pretty foreign sounding to an American cook such as myself. Definitely written for the English palate."
5,Excellent buy,"I bought this book after barely looking at it because I was captivated by the picture of the camembert and tomato tart. Well, I ended with and extraordinary book on both sweet and savory tarts!! I've tried the corn and scallion, the quiche lorraine (the best ever), the quince tart and the camembert and tomato and they're all so good!! It's definitely one of my favorite books now. Worth every cent."
5,Totally approachable!,"I purchased this book a few weeks ago becuause I've always wanted to learn how to make tarts - they seem like a perfect light dinner alternative. Unsure of what I would be getting, I'm absolutely thrilled with The Art of the Tart. The author's instructions are easy to follow, even for beginners (I had never made pastry before). She makes the subject completely accessible. I made the Swiss Chard, Gruyere and Creme Fraiche Tart on my first try and it was excellent. The recipes all sound absolutely delicious and I can't wait to try more. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Decent router with average stregth,"Overall, nice tool but not very powerful. Good for drywall but nothing thicker or harder. The two bits that it comes with are very weak. Strongly recommend buying stronger assessories."
4,Excellent lessons - Mac users beware,"This suite of software is very easy to use. You can listen to conversations, participate in conversations, slow things down to hear pronunciation more clearly, etc etc. Loaded with features that I don't use, because even just the basic feature set is enough to get you going.However, Mac users beware. This is *not* version 9; it's version 8.1. Transparent Language used to have a big notice about the differences between Mac and Windows versions for this release, but that notice seems to have disappeared, so I thought that this was finally the *real* version 9. Not so. Granted, it does run natively on OS X now, which was worth the purchase to me, but does not have the new features of version 9 for Windows.Overall very good product. I can't go into too much detail about the features, because I haven't needed them; the software does a good job without complicating things, but offers extra features for those that will use them."
2,Good start but lacks cohesiveness in its (Italian) method,The single major flaw in this product is its lack of direction for the beginner. I purchased the Italian version to compare it to Rosetta Stone's method. The difference in price will tell you which is the better one. This product has good ideas (dialogs & memory games) but Rosetta Stone's approach is sound and well organized.This product DOES have more resources than Rosetta Stone but they're left to the user to figure out how to utilize them when studying the lessons. For beginners this will lead to a lot of wasted time and frustration.Stuffing the product with goodies does not make it better. They need to concentrate on the HOWTOs. Until such time this product is not very useful to beginners.
1,The worst possible way to learn a language,"The user interface is so hard to follow it's unbelievable. You have to scan up the screen, then down to the right, then over to the left and track all of this while trying to learn vocabulary.I bought this thinking that it was only $40 so how bad could it be...well it is BAD!Buy the FSI courses or Rosetta Stone - they are much more expensive but worth the price, especially if LanguageNow is the alternative. I have French, Spanish, German, and Russian and each of them are fantastic. Of course they are two different methods of learning but both are effective in their own way. At the end of the day you need to go to the country where the language is spoken and spend some time to really learn a language..."
5,Best CD ever to hit the market,"This by far the best CD i ever heard, first time i heard lynch was in my friends durango and boom i fell in love with this CD, he combines lyrics with the phatest beats on the planet. With songs like return of da baby killa and locc2 da brain this CD brings a new meaning horror core rap and rap alone. You think eminem is bad in lyrics, you havent seen brotha lynch hung yet. With lyrics like these your head will spin into a new world. Also with some appearances with other rappers, inlcuding Mr. Doc this hits hard. He represents Sac town with this CD has the BEST CD EVER!!!"
4,"classic Brotha Lynch Hung, tight lyrics and tight beats","This was his third main stream album. He has shown much improvment over his last two. Brotha Lynch Hung can lyrically blow your mind and mesmorize you with his beats. His next album ""Loaded"" was by far the best however."
1,this album is sick and dirty.,The artist is a sick and twisted song writer. He needs christ in his life.
1,nasty garbage,ill be quite honest with you i could not listen to but about 10 minutes of this album the cheesy production comined with some of the most outrageously violent and sexual content I have ever heard all blends into one boring monotone its almost like this guy (brotha lynch) just says hmmm lets see how outrageously nasty I can be and how many times I can use the F word on each track. I do not consider this talent nor do i consider this sick or deranged. this is what I like to call the Eminem syndrome just some idiot trying to make everone think hes all sick and demented when in reality anyone given the right amount of free time and some acid could easily dream this stuff up. Man if this is what is takes to be famous im in the wrong biz know what I mean.
5,"THIS IS THE BEST RAP CD, EVER",Brotha Lynch Hung is the best rapper out. This is the best CD I have ever listened to. Lynch keeps on coming out with the siccest lyrics. Every track gets better as you listen. You don't know rap until you have heard this. His lyrics will mesmerize you.
5,SicC SicC SicC. He cant be compared with. EBK,"This CD was very raw, and maxed out with O.G. lyrics. Two guns up on this one! No one will understand him unless they listen to him. Loced out and smoked out."
3,tight album,"this is a pretty good album but i dont understand why people are sellin this for 30 dollars an higher its not even rare an its not even a classic i just saw it at a couple cd stores in my area sellin for like 17 ,18 dollars any one who buys it for 30 dollars is stupid an if ur cd store dont have it in stock they can order it for u for like 18 dollars dont buy these its a rip off!!"
5,My favorite rap album,"This is straight up my favorite album of all time, my favorite out of all the other stuff i listen to like korn, tool, the dayton family, three-6-mafia, deftones........and many others. My favorite songs on this are Datz real Gangsta and Welcome to Your Own Death. Pick this up if you have not already, you wont regret it, it is tha SHIZNIT"
5,"Sick, Sick And Very Sick","Brotha Lynch Hung is a man with no faith, sense of duty and responsibility. He will definitely go to hell becuase he deserves it. Us humans need to be kind hearted, social, amiable, good-natured and religious. Brotha Lynch lacks all these essential qualities needed in humans. Please do not listen to this CD because it promotes violence, death, and cannibalism. It made me want to gnash my teeth on human flesh, and drink human blood. This record has turned me into an insane human-killer and a man-eater. The hugely entertaining and original style, and clever lyrics of Brotha Lynch should not distract you from the fact that this album turns you into a flesh-eating monster. SAVE ME AND SAVE US ALL!!!!"
4,Revolutionary artist/poet/rapper explodes onto the seen..,"UNBELIEVABLE....the absolute best rap I have ever heard in all my life. Every time I listen to this disk, I think how impossible writing these lyrics would be to a mere mortal"
5,DA SICCNESS LIVES ON,"I remember randomly snagging this album up, back near its release date, when I was into nothing but rap/hip-hop during the high school years...and it truly is more than just a classic...I would probably label it an ""Epic of Horrific Proportions"" actually. Brotha Lynch fuses the darkest beats with the sickest lyrics to produce one wicked-smooth debut album. I am currently into dark dnb and hardcore/terrorcore and there is no doubt in my mind that ""Season of Da Siccness"" provided me with the foundation for my present taste in music - it is a definite addition to anyone's collection of sick and twisted albums - we surely need more artists like him today yo."
1,Watch this only if you are in it,"I purchased this video for one reason only...it was filmed in my hometown, and I was an extra in it. Originally made for TV, this movie aired opposite Monday Night Football. After encouraging my friends and coworkers to watch it, the next day I had to apologize profusely...it was that bad.Starring Ed Marinaro (Hill Street Blues, Sisters) and Melody Anderson (who?), this story was loosely based on the true story of a policewoman who posed for Playboy and the consequences of that decision. Donna Pescow (Saturday Night Fever) played the heroine's best friend and was the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal movie."
1,Literature professor tackles Big Problem,"This is one of the dumbest books I've not finished reading. A professor of American Literature with a family income of $250,000 tackles the Big Problem: Economic Inequality is the Basic Social Problem facing this country--but he's not giving any of his money away. In fact, he says he wrote the book so he could make more money. He advocates closing all private schools and other nonsense as solutions to the problem. He claims that the only meaningful equality is equality of outcome. Sure, we all have the right to be doctors and lawyers and so forth if we want to be.What he has to say about race is not worth summarizing.It's a silly book. Don't waste your money.."
3,an article would have sufficed,"The author's thesis is an important one: the American celebration of diversity masks, and may be designed to mask, increasing economic inequality and decreasing social mobility. He makes his point in a funny and engaging (if self-indulgent) way. But his jabs lose their force under the weight of repetition. By mid-book the reader -- at least this reader -- has read enough."
2,Runs out of Steam,"The main idea is that too much focus on diversity has allowed the schools/press/government to take their focus off the more critical issue of levelling the ECONOMIC playing field, rather than the absurd and meaningless ""diversity"" playing filed, which plays into the elite/rich right's (and left's) hands.I agree with the author that too much focus is put on race (the author makes the point that race really ""shouldn't matter"", and may not even really exist); indeed there are some interesting views made on Plessy vs. Ferguson. However, towards the end of the book, when the author branches out to say that the USA's language, and culture (and, by extrapolation, borders) ""don't matter"" either and shouldn't be the subject of any argument, it became clear that the author had already run out of useful subject matter in this relatively small book."
5,Surrender to Sarah Brightman!!! :),"This CD is simply amazing! I prefer this album over ""Dive"" because Brightman sticks to what she knows best - which is opera! Surrender, Unexpected Song, Chanson D'efance, Tell Me on a Sunday, and Nothing Like You've Ever Known are simply brilliant and beautiful pieces music! Sadly, I do not prefer the 2 songs from Cats - about Macavaty and Gus. They really do not seem to fit to Brightman's style of music, for they are more outgoing! However, Memory from Cats (in Italian) is beautiful with soaring octaves! Everything's Alright is genius, with a 5/4 tempo, and it makes the song amazing. Pie Jesu is a beautiful piece, but I prefer Charlotte Church singing it. Brightman's vocals show to much vibrato, and it makes the song seem annoying! Amigos Para Siempre and the Spanish version of ""Don't Cry for Me Argentina"" are fairly decent pieces from Brightman. If you love the Brightman from ""The Phantom of the Opera"", then buy this album!!!"
5,Sarah at her best!!!!!,"This CD is a must for any fan of Sarah Brightman and Andrew Lloyd Webber. All the songs are wonderful, and the Italian versions of ""Memory"" and ""With One Look"" are beautiful.... This import is worth the price."
5,"Lauderdale, what a Guy!!!","This is a fantasic CD, I listened to the CD first and was amazed that every song was excellent. Then I read the flyer and saw that not only did Jim Lauderdale sing in almost all the songs but he was a song writer in 13 of the 14 songs!! Talk about talent in being able to write winner after winner and even have the voice to sing them! If that was not enough, you get Ralph Stanley and the Clinch Mountain Boys!!! This is a must-have CD for any bluegrass fan. Oh, the song Lauderdale didn't write was Boat of Love...written by Bill Monroe!!!!"
5,HIGH AND LIFTED UP,"IT IS ONE OF THE CHOIR'S BEST. IT MINISTERS TO ME AND ANYONE WHO HEARS IT. THEY ARE AN ANNOINTED CHOIR. I FOLLOW THEM WHEN THEY ARE IN MY AREA. KEEP ON BEING A BLESSING TO EVERYONE. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEM THEM IN PERSON, MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT AND YOU WILL BE BLESSED. REMEMBER THEY ARE NOT PERFORMERS. THEY ARE MINISTERS THROUGH SONG."
2,they are tatsty but got them too expensive at amazon,"They taste good but i think amazon is selling them very expensive, i get flyers from local safeway and they are much much cheaper.one would think that buying in bulk would save me money but no, not the case!! compare before you buy!"
4,"Perfect size, convenient","For 90 calories, this bar is super convenient and the perfect size to keep in the glove box, purse or cooler for a quick snack to carry me over between meals....not too filling, but again, it's perfect to hold me off for an hour till the next 'real' meal."
4,Drawing And Painting With Colored Pencil,"Drawing And Painting With Colored Pencilery good reference book, I was very happy"
1,A Waste of money and time,There are many other books available on this subject and they are all better than this one. There is nothing to be gained from reading this book. Forget it!
4,Stunning Examples,"The illustrations for the techniques are Kutch's own colored pencil artwork. Her flowers are stunning and if I ever achieve a drawing on the level of her poppies or the morning glories, I'll be very happy.Unfortunately, I struggled with some of the directions, bogging down over the art terms and special tools that I don't yet have. I think I'd benefit from rereading this book after I experiment more and stock in some of the supplies (special papers, ball burnisher, citrus thinner, etc.).The techniques are shown in 5 or 6 steps with the illustration progressing as she describes the colors used. Most of the examples are flowers or fruit, but a few landscapes round it out.The first 49 pages deal with regular colored pencils, then the rest of the book goes on to watercolor pencils and the techniques for those."
4,Beautiful Book,Kristy is one of the best colored pencil artists around. She has the true soul of an artist and is a great instructor. This book has beautiful art and is a worthwhile addition to any colored pencil artist's library. I have enjoyed her workshops and DVDs too!
5,Drawing and Painting with Coored Pencil-Basic techniqes,"Absolitely fantastic colored pencil works is amazing to describe. Though it is considered Basic Techniques, this books shows how to apply them together for aweswome finished products."
5,Compact Tool Set,This is a great little tool set for my V-Strom DL-650. The tools are well made and they all fit into a nice compact package. It will be nice to have everything in a small package instead of scattered all over my saddlebags. Good value for the money.
3,Disconnected,"My daughter was THRILLED when she received her Amy Brown Bubble Rider VI Fairy ornament! She didn't open the box until she got home (I hadn't opened it because it was sealed when I received it) and found out that the fairy had become detached from the bubble. All it took was a little glue to remedy the situation BUT it really shouldn't have had to have been repaired given that it was a new product.This was the first time I have ever used anything like this and now I wondering if I will use it again. Tends to make you a little ""gun shy"". As far as rating the item, it really was cute but i DID NOT like the condition that it was sent in."
1,I've Been Swindled!,"Her first CD, Tiempos Nuevos, was vastly superior to this one. I bought it on the strength of the first CD only to discover that it was a bomb. I only listened to half of it before I took it off for fear of barfing. It's little wonder that she never releaced any more CDs after this one."
5,opinión,"Algo que me caracteriza es ser una persona inteligente.Generalmente no soy muy dado a ser fanático de algún artista,ya sea hombre o mujer,pero cuando escuché a Irán Castillo por primera vez,me pareció simplemente ""FABULOSA"", tiene un ángel increíble,así como una voz excepcional,mención aparte merece su extraordinaria belleza.Por lo que yo quisiera recomendar ampliamente este CD para aquellas personas que buscan una voz diferente dentro de la música."
5,A Great Talent!,"This young lady has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard...Her song, ""Girando en el Tiempo""..Is one of the best songs I've heard in a Long Time...I Highly recommend everyone to buy this CD...I Guarantee you'll like it as much as myself...God Bless..."
4,The end of an adventure - a tragedy,"The end of the French presence in Indochina, a beautiful adventure, great destinies. The last days of Din Bin Phu. Epic scenes. The impression of chaos very well rendered by Pierre Schoendoerffer who lived this battle, in 1954, camera in hand.The film makes a fair tribute to soldiers who have sacrificed for the honor, the lieutenants and captains who were the actors in this battle, isolated as described so well Erwan Bergot ""The 170 days of Dien Bien Ph and Jean-Pierre Bernier ""Dien Bien Phu."" Tribute to this great warrior that was Bigeard. A film of great emotions."
3,Barbie collector item,Very easy steps in ordering and arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. This is a keepsake doll for my granddaughter and will not be taken out of the packaging.
2,Version 3 of this product was poor,"I would only recommend version 3 if your needs for an installer were extremely basic. The products wizard-oriented approach was fine for a simple install, but its confusing interface and inscrutable error messages will leave you frustrated if you try to go beyond it. Take a very careful look at this new version before buying."
3,lanikai LU 21CE,"nice looking but arrived with a crack around the equilizer, wires all over the inside making vibrating contact with the back, the strings slipping out of the top bridge and the E string with a serious vibration. I crazy glued the crack hoping it doesn't get bigger and had to dig out some plastic to make the strings stay put but the E string vibration can't cure. Why do I still like it so much then, it's got personality."
5,first aid gel,An absolute necessity for the first aid kit for people or animals. Controls bleeding from cuts and keeps the cut closed like a glue. I have used it on my dog's very deep cut paw pad and an ear laceration. Both healed quickly without infections.
5,Fantastic product,"Owning dogs, it is a product I will not be without. When one of my dogs had an injury that bled a lot, this product was fantastic. I will always keep it on hand."
5,can't do without,This product is a necessity in the home and car. From minor cuts to big wounds EMT gel works on both pets and people
5,Healing well,Been using on a non-healing wound of a German Shepherd for three weeks now. Wound has shrunk to half the size. Hair is starting to grow back. Would probably have even better results if the dog was unable to lick the wound.
4,good,"this is a good thing to have in your truck or back pack if you have a buddy who goes with you every where. add with Vetrap 4"" x 5 Yard Roll and a venom extractor. you can take care of your pup till you get to a vet. glad i bought.will buy more"
5,fabulous!,"I will never go without this product, I have a cat who beat his ear to a pulp, the ear looked like it was raw meat, and this stuff healed it in two days! It's absolutely amazing."
4,Great,This was a good book on home heating systems. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have the new kinds of heating such as geothermal.
2,Very cheap plastic,The mirror is great. The plastic is made of very cheap material. I would invest another dollar or two and get something more solid.
1,ARRIVED BROKEN,"Mirror arrived broken. Wasn't even packaged with anything protective. If you need a mirror like this, listen to other reviewers and save your money.... buy one at a beauty supply store as this was a waste of time and money."
3,Cheap,"I shave my head myself, and use this mirror to see the back of my head. It works, but it's cheap. It fogs up and it gets really dirty. I have to clean it a lot. Otherwise, it is the right shape, size, and price. Gets the job done."
2,Flimsy handle,"The handle/case was made of flimsy plastic that barely held the mirror's weight, and the mirror itself looked like it wanted to pop out of its frame. I can't justify paying $14.00 for something this flimsy. You'd probably be better served getting a Goody brand mirror for far cheaper."
3,Ok mirror for the price...,"The only complaint I would have is for the manufacturer. The handle is pretty thin and will bend slightly when you move the mirror. I purchased another handle mirror at the same time by Floxite that has two sides to it and it is built more solidly. While this mirror would be fine for many, for me I just felt like eventually the handle will crack if moved too suddenly since it was so top heavy and by the handle swaying and bending when moving it. I didn't want that while I was trying to trim the hair on the back of my head."
1,Do not buy.,"I'm not sure if it was because of the flimsiness of the mirror or the poor packaging, but the mirror arrived broken. If you're looking for a hand mirror I would suggest looking elsewhere. The plastic handle is not sturdy and the mirror is extremely fragile. A completely different spot of the mirror cracked when trying to piece back together. Has the quality of something you would buy for a dollar at a dollar store."
2,Terrible quality,The casing and handle is flimsy and weak. The weight of the low quality short and weak handle causes the handle to bend when you hold it by the handle alone.Was overpriced when I bought it. The price has dropped from 8 to 6 dollars.Dollar store quality. Don't buy.
3,Not without flaws,Its a mirror...It does its job and the only thing wrong with it that I can think of is that the glass mirror itself slides around inside the plastic frame which could lead to the mirror breaking.
3,Nice and large.,I like the large size of the mirror. My only concern is that the handle seems very flimsy and could break very easily.
2,"Yep, it's a mirror...","nothing wrong with the mirror, but the casing is made of very flimsy plastic, where it literally rocks back and forth when you hold it by the handle. The likely hood of this product standing the test of time is low. I'm pretty sure the handle will eventually break off the bottom of the mirror where it is weakest. I personally would not buy again, or recommend to any friends."
3,Fair price for what you get.,"The mirror is as the descriptions says. It works good, but is not of the highest quality. The plastic is a little cheap and the handle of the mirror is a little flimsy. But hey, it works."
2,Received mirror with a nice crack - Hopefully no bad luck comes my way!!,Shipping was very fast and the box was intact so I'm figuring mirror was damaged before they boxed it up. The crack is in the lower right hand corner of mirror so I guess it's still somewhat usable. I would send it back but I'm wondering if it's even worth the hassle seeing as though it was only $9.45. Hopefully they'll send me a replacement without any issues. We shall see.
2,probably shouldn't order a mirror though the mail,opened the package and cracked -- my fault for thinking I could have a mirror shipped to me. Either that or it breaks easily. Not worth sending back.
2,Handle of miror is too thin and flexible,"This is a fairly large mirror and I liked it a lot. However, I returned it for a refund because it felt too cheap. When holding the mirror by the handle, you are definitely aware that the handle is inadequate - too thin and flexible. Feels like the mirror is going to wobble around."
2,Poor quality,This thing's made of cheap material. The plastic handle will bend back and forth when it's held upright because of the weight of big piece of glass mirror. I can picture it break easily if some pressure is applied.
3,"Handle is not firm, it bends. Otherwise it's ok","This mirror is not a bad deal economically. But I'd pay a few dollars more to have a real handle. It's frustrating to hold because it bends, and you have to brace your thumb against the backside when using it."
2,Blurry,"It's a little blurry and scratched (as it came). It's also pretty flimsy. It does a good enough job for as little as I use it, but don't expect anything great."
1,Shipment Was Horrible,"I got this mirror in pieces, i was so upset. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning. Just know you could go to your local Walmart or Sally's hair store and grab you one of these, without the pain of waiting 4-7 days, receiving the thing, and it's in a mess. Boo!"
4,It's a mirror alright,"It worked but I broke it the second day I had it. That was two mirrors broken in two weeks, so I'm looking at 14 years of bad luck.The only con was it was a little bit flimsy."
5,Perfect for work,This mirror is perfect for my hairdressing business as it is large enough for the customers to see the back of their heads and the price is very good too. I have dropped these before from about 5 ft and they were durable so added bonus.
3,It works,This mirror works for the job that it was designed to do but it is very cheap. Feels like a Dollar store item
2,Not a minute of dream team foortage,"The 35-minute-video brings short portraits of every member of the original Dream Team of the 1992 Olympics: Johnson, Bird, Mullin, Ewing, Robinson, Stockton, Malone, Pippen, Barkley and MJ. This footage is your standard clips of some dunks or assists with a standard spoken text. But there is not a single minute of the Dream Team playing at the Olympics, so the title is misleading. The two stars are for the individual portraits."
5,Veeery Nice,"Great album, I was able to finally find ""Volvere a Nacer..."" which is one of my favorite songs from the great Raphael..."
3,Confusing and interesting at the same time,"I saw this movie and found that I was confused through the whole movie. At the end, it did remind me of the movie ""A beautiful mind"". The movie could have been done alot better with a little bit more complete story line, but over all it was an ok movie. To me, this movie wasn't scarey or like any type of horror movie it is a ""thriller"" sort of."
2,TRAUMATIZED,"Other than Colin Firth's compelling performance, there is little else to recommend TRAUMA. A puzzling mind game passed off as ""artistic film-making"", the movie never rewards its audience with the payoff of what was real and what was Firth's fantasies. A movie that fails to accomplish a true resolution is merely an exercise in cinematic self-absorption, which is what TRAUMA achieves. Firth does a good job considering his role is so poorly conceived."
5,Astounding performance!,"I have never written a review and suspense/thriller is my least favorite genre. Having said that, I watched this movie because of Colin Firth. I think he has been generally underated for years. What pleased me about this film was his absolutely compelling performance. It is a tour de force. Yes, the sound quality was not great, but that did not detract from the power of the internal journey depicted by Mr. Firth. For anyone who ever enjoyed the dashing Mr. D'Arcy...watch this film and see the diligent and concentrated performance of a truly gifted actor."
2,Traumatic mess,"Trauma is a traumatic mess, where you're unable to hear the speaking parts because it's so low. The DVD itself is bad because unless you can read Spanish subtitles, you're out of luck hearing certain parts. Firth is good, but Suvari is as bland as cardboard."
1,Boooooring,"If you saw the trailer like I did, you expect someting else, the guy who did it should get an award just for that, the movie itself is just plain boring, nothing ever happens, all the time you're trying to figure out just what in the world is really going on, and the ending is about the only good thing about this one,only because you're so tired of all the so called psychologycal drama. What really hurts is all the time they killed to get to the truth behind all this mess, I hit the wall watching this one, expected a whole lot more, and it just didn't deliver."
3,"Trauma for the viewer, as well","TRAUMA is a minor supernatural frighter that stars Colin Firth as a man who awakens from a coma to learn that his wife has died in the car wreck that also nearly killed him. After getting involved with another woman, Firth starts having hallucinations of his dead wife, visions that begin to drive him mad.It shoulda been better!Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(4.6) Trauma (UK-2004) - Colin Firth/Neva Suvari/Naomie Harris"
1,Unpleasant,"Ben (Colin Firth) was in a bad car accident that killed his wife. As the story opens he's in the hospital, coming out of a coma. He goes back to his creepy apartment building where he is the only resident. He cannot come to terms with his wife's death and hallucinates about her constantly. To make things worse, he finds himself the prime suspect in the brutal murder of a famous rock singer.Yikes. This is a bad movie. It attempts to be an art film delving into the mind of a mentally ill man, but falls completely flat and is just one long, confusing, and very unpleasant movie. We never know if what we are seeing is real or imagined; it's too hard to follow and totally repellent. Firth does the best he can with the terrible script but I didn't like or care about his character at all. If you're afraid of creepy crawly creatures, this is not the movie for you; the same goes if you're looking for Firth to be a debonair heartthrob. Not recommended."
5,Simply wonderful,"I heard Adam Hochschild on the radio discussing ""To End All Wars' -his book about WWI. This book was added to my order as almost an afterthought. I am so glad I included it. While my own parent/child relationship was very different from this one I think anyone who had parents or is a parent can find insights and new awareness in reading this book. I found myself thinking over my own parent relationships and those of people close to me with new understanding. The writing is wonderful and the characters become part of your life. This is one of those books you hate to give up and after finishing I continued to search for parts I wanted to read again. Highly recommended!"
2,I didn't want my children to listen to this one,"In converting Old Testament stories to narrative form, Mr. Weiss adds quite a bit of editorializing, which in my opinion alters significantly the action and meaning of the text. We may certainly have our own opinions about why people did things, but to insert them as part of a storyline for children, who tend to take as accurate the first version of a story they hear, is a mistake. Keep it simple & true to the text, would be my first request of any biblical narrative."
2,"Solid musicianship, unoriginal songs","I've followed this band since its inception. No doubt Kory's greatest strength is his marketing ability. His music, for whatever reason, does move people. However, I do believe its premature to bill him as the ""Midwest's next great songwriter"" I can play three chords and tell the world how great my life is too. Now that you've got the resources guys, push the envelope a bit."
4,A Very Worthwhile Purchase,"I borrowed the CD from a friend before it was available in the Omaha area. I liked it well enough that I had her pick up a copy for me during one of her visists to the Sioux Falls area. I have since seen the band live on two occasions. My comments are 1) the band puts on a great show, 2) the CD is very good, and 3) there probably isn't a single on the CD that will kickstart the band to stardom."
3,Nothing new but a solid pop-rock CD.,This CD is from a very solid band that could definately do a little more. A few less 3 chord songs and a little more emphasis on backing vocals and guitars would be a step in the right direction. This band definately has potential to be something big if they contiue to mature as a group and stay together!
1,What a disapointment,These guys used to be such an awesome hip-hop funk kind of a thing...now they sound all Hootie. I disapprove. Yuck !
1,Lame.,"THis is one of the most cutesy-pie, sugar-coated pieces of garbage that I have ever heard in my life. AVOID !"
2,Ignor All South Dakota Reviews...except this one,"Attn Sioux Falls: Giving Radiate a good review doesn't mean you're cool. All the 5-star reviews from this region indicates a lack of objectivity. Local fans of this band aren't really listening. If they did they'd hear a CD full of poorly written songs played by average musicians. It aint good, it aint bad...it's just nothing special."
5,"The ""BIBS""","I first met Ring Lardner's BIB BALLADS in a university library's Rare Book Room back in the 1970s, and was ecstatic to find them back in print. This small volume is a true gem, which I heartily recommend them to anyone who has, is going to have, or has ever been a small child. Also, I can think of no better baby shower gift. Almost the only place they show their age is in the ballad reflecting what a dollar might buy in 1915. While the poems would stand alone, Fontaine Fox's illustrations are perfect.I'm stingy with assigning stars. For me, three stars means very good. I can think of few books I'd call ""five-star."" This is one of those few. I love Lardner's ""Bibs"" like I love Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Have yet to read anything else by Lardner, but understand this is an atypical offering from his pen."
5,Flat iron surface is clean again.WORKS GREAT!,"I have always had flat irons to come to their demise after a year or two of putting out. Never did I think it was because of the heating element having to work overtime, and under extreme pressure, due to the fact that I never cleaned them.With this last flat iron purchase I decided to do a little different. So before this one died I decided to clean it. Boy does this cleaner work. Coated with burnt on gunk about 1mm thick, this job was not easy, nor was it too hard. It just took a while to actually get down to the plate safely, without damaging it. I know for a fact nothing else would have worked. This stuff is great.My husband can now use this on the house iron too, because he always leaves black crap on the iron; and it seems to happen when I want to iron a white shirt, or my white jeans.Actually it cleaned the clothes iron so well, that it now glides over the clothes again"
2,Not very helpful,"I gave this program a fair shake, and overall I'm quite unimpressed. One of the program's key features in my book is the ability to say a word and have it judge you based on sound, pitch, etc. Great in theory, but imagine my surprise when I found out I could say anything at all, such as ""Cheeto"" and still get a perfect score so long as I mimicked the speaker even a little. This program also does very little to teach grammar rules.Basically, if you already know some Japanese and you're just looking for a vocab builder, it might be worth getting it cheap. You can cheat the speech system, but if you really do try and read the graphs, you can tell if you're actually getting it right or not. It's a sub par tool, but a tool none the less."
1,This software is confusing,"This software is very confusing to use. The layout and navigation is not user friendly. The program was not helpful for learning how to speak and carry a conversation unless you are already fluent. In which case, why would you need the learning software? I am at an intermediate level Japanese. I didn't like this product. The Power Japanese and Rosette Stone Japanese softwares were much more helpful in furthering my language studies."
5,Learn Japanese,This program is so great!!! Not only does it allow you to learn Japanese but you can go at your own pace unlike many other ways to learn a language. My favorite feature is the interactive conversation practices which simulate a life like conversation between you and the computer. The amount of Japanese that is attainable through this is incredible. The practice games are all very fun and enjoyable. Good product and great buy overall!!!!!
4,One of their best,This may have been their best album as a duo (after Dan Peek left). They strike the right balance between their own material and that of outside writers. This was their comeback album in 1982 and produced one big hit (You Can Do Magic) and one minor hit (Right Before Your Eyes). The only song on it that I did not care for was Even The Score. The rest of the material is very good.
4,great fun but not at all durable,"My 3 yr-old twin sons love working like daddy with their new tool box. They love the saw (which makes a little sawing noise), they love to pound in the ""nails"" with the hammer, and they are learning to screw in the nails with the screw driver. The only problem is that the latches on both toolboxes broke within a day, no exaggeration. Now my kids can't carry around the tools in the box, which was one of the reasons we purchsed this particular toolbox set. I am going to have to go out and buy them new boxes, so we probably should have bought a more expensive set of tools with box in the first place."
4,Just Like Daddys Tools!,"My son is too old for this now (he is 7) but five years ago we bought this for him and he loved playing with it. We had been on the hunt for tools that looked realistic and were pleased to find this. My son loved the fact it came in a tool box just like daddy's so he could carry it around where ever he went ""fixing"" things around the house. We added to this set with other Home Depot tool sets and most of the items fit into this tool box with ease. If your little boy or girl enjoys following daddy or even mommy around the house to help ""fix"" things then this set is perfect. My son now has the Home Depot Tool set that is the real deal and is his size which he loves."
5,"Timeless; no ""skip"" required","I bought this CD ages ago after listening to the group at a Renaissance Faire. After all this time, I still like to pull it out and play it every month or so. I listen to this CD more than any other of the genre. You won't want to skip any of the songs. They're all great pieces of music!"
4,Little lamp shade,"I apparently don't visualize well. I thought this would fit a standard sized light bulb but it's actually much smaller and designed for a candlestick lightbulb. Next time I'll use a tape measurer to get a better idea of size from the product description. Despite it's size, the shade is nice."
2,Sci Fi Channel Dino Fluff,"This was not meant to be a great movie. If you are a fourteen year old looking for a new dinosaur vs people movie,this will probably still disappoint.I love monster movies. I love dinosaurs! I love dopey drive-in fodder. Allowing for all that,this was still not a good movie.I have seen better SPFX on video games. I have read better dialog in comic books. Sadly, it was too bloody for younger viewers and too stupid for older ones.When it comes to monster movies, I really am a cheap date, shamelessly easy to entertain. This was just a sad waist of effort.No excuse for that one. They could have done everything better.JPF"
2,Raptor Island,"This DVD is more of a comedy for adults. It is very weak in the filming. For example, the opening scene of an airplane flying, looks like someone took a toy plane and swung it from a string and rocked it back and forth. From that point on, it was fun to see how amaturish the film was. Probably should have returned it."
2,Arabic Now 9,"This set is extremely confusing to use. No instructions are given whatsoever on how to use the various features it is supposed to have. You have to sit there and ""experiment"" and still not be able to use it as it is extoled to be.It immediately delves into advanced, complicated speak patterns, with no explainations given for grammar rules.the only redeeming value is the word processing software included to write in Arabic, once you learn it from another source!I am sorry I wasted my money. Don't you be."
4,Great Euro Disco,"There are songs on this album that I heard back in 1985-86 and had no idea who sang them, so buying it was a pleasant discovery. This is a perfect example of mid-80s high energy club euro disco. Challenger and Happy Song are ultimate classics, and you can get this album just to have these two in your collection, if you're into that style of music, of course.I know nothing about the band, sounds like little kids singing, which resembles the style of Video Kids, but the music is pleasing to the ear and sets your feet in motion."
4,Good update on the opening,"This provides an interesting update on the opening. Contains reasonably good descriptions of various lines as illustrated by latest games played by top players, but still cannot remove the general doubt that the King' Gambit is quite over-ambitious and risky in modern times."
3,Author Loathing The King's Gambit,"Is it just me or does the author seem to take special delight in seeing black come out on top in many of the lines he provides? He seems to be cheering everytime black is doing well and shaking his head with disdain every time white tries to create some fun and magic with the King's Gambit. I think if we pin McDonald down we can get a confession out of him ""okay okay, I admit it, I hate the king's gambit! It has the giant balls that I'll never have!"" Gallagher's book is much better, more complete from a guy who plays it regularly because he believes in it and it doesn't come with all the heavy cynicism."
3,"Come back, Joe!","Well, there are some good things here; the explanation of the ideas behind Shirov's 5. . .d6 in the Kieseritsky gambit sticks out in my mind as very helpful. But McDonald just isn't a romantic; he's one of those guys who, if he's playing say a Modern defense, erects a light-square blockade, trades off the QB for a N, and hangs on for dear life. This book betrays similar instincts. Far from stirring up your enthusiasm, it is actually in danger of convincing readers that the KG is unplayable! And it isn't. Oh ye of litle faith!"
2,Decent Game,"I bought this game for a friend's daughter, and I'd say this is better than most other Harry Potter games. (Though that may not be saying much.) She didn't really like the rules, so we played it a different way, which I think is a good quality in a board game, but for harry Potter fans, this isn't particualrly well made, or well detailed, and the figures are a little wierd."
2,Must have been better in person or something,Some of the singing lacking in energy. Fleming is way too controlled. Music is top-notch Liner notes were interesting in describing how each part was customized for the 18th century egos who sang the roles.
2,What a letdown!,"Boring, unlike their first cd Andromeda, this one is so flat and uninspired. I have listened to it 4 times and only Escapar stands out as memorable. It is so bland, were they in a rush to get these songs out, I don't know! what a waste of talent!"
3,too big for a small face,"The style of the sunglasses is classic, yet very modern. Unfortunately, if you have a small face, the sunglasses will overtake your face and instead of complementing your features, these will be hidden behind the glasses. Buy them only if you're into being trendy without regards for style and looks."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"This is without question one of the worst books I have ever encountered. Bego does nothing more than recycle interviews and rip off Rich Wiseman's book. There is no new information about Browne in here--Bego didn't speak to anyone close to Browne for this book and his research is limited to major U.S. publications, and he frequently gets the information wrong.I'm a fan of Browne's, but this book isn't worth reading or buying. Bego is a hack who didn't even bother fact checking his material. I'm just wondering how he has the nerve to call himself a writer and how he got a publisher for this trash."
1,Terrible book,"If you look at the other books the author has written, you'll see that he just spits out these celebrity biographies as quickly as he can to make a buck, without taking the time to do any new research. Like the other reviewers said, this book is a complete waste of time and is so carelessly written, with many errors in songtitles and dates, etc. Mark Bego should be ashamed of himself for producing such a poorly written book."
1,Terrible,"I couldn't finish the book due to how terribly written it was. And what's the deal with all those shadow boxes throughout the book, those annoying boxes with a repeat sentence in it? What's that all about? I wish I had taken the time to read a review before buying this, but unfortunately I didn't. I normally save my books, but this one went into the trash."
5,A classic recording from Curzon,"Towards the end of Robert Schumann's life, as he became more and more unhinged, he claimed to be taking direct musical dictation from angels. Clifford Curzon's towering and emotionally rich performance of these works leaves you in no doubt that this was indeed the case.The Fantasie in C major is played with a passion and sensitivity all Curzon's own - it is as though the music was written especially for him; and with the Kinderszenen, he perfectly brings out the crystaline beauty in their apparent, lullabyesque simplicity.Curzon's performance of Schubert's Wanderer-Fantasie is equally mesmerising. As a pianist, there are few who can match his talent and these recordings have rightly been included in Decca's Legendary Legend series. This comes highly recommended."
5,Surprisingly Wonderful!,"I seen the video this past weekend, and let me tell you, IT'S GREAT. A truly different side of Phil Collins. Didn't know he had it in him. If you truly love jazz this is the one for you. Coming from a keyboardist and drummer, he's been practicing a lot."
4,"PHIL DELIVERS FINE ""BIG BAND"" ALBUM","""A Hot Night In Paris"" is Phil Collins and friends (including long-time Genesis live session man Daryl Steurmer) deliver a ""different"" type of solo album with this very jazz sounding CD. Released on the heels of his very succesful ""Tarzan"" soundtrack with its #1 single ""You'll Be In My Heart"", some fans might be turned off by Phil just drumming and no singing on this CD, but like his buddy Eric Clapton sometimes he just likes to sit back and play what made him famous. The standouts here are the big band versions of ""That's All"", ""Against All Odds"", and the ""Los Endos Suite"" which is a nice touch to an overlooked Genesis gem from ""A Trick Of The Tail"" which was Phil's first as lead vocalist. Also the sound is first-rate. A nice change of pace for Mr. Collins."
3,It's jazzy,"Phil Collins goes jazzy. We had that already when he played with Brand X, which was a marvelous adventure. But here he kind of fails. It's ok, but on the whole there's not much pepper in it. Good old Phil has lost something after But seriously."
2,Beware! It is an instrumental CD!,"I thought this concert would provide different versions of Phil's best known songs and some rarities, but instead it is about a good jazz band playing his songs INSTRUMENTAL!If you were looking for Phil Collins in this CD, you'll only find him on the drums..."
2,Not any good! Beware!,"I was psyched about this album as a concept. However after listening to it repeatedly, I can say it's a dud. I'm a huge Genesis and Phil Collins fan too. I don't know why he did it. Very lame."
2,Very Predictable,nothing really here to get excited about.the Arrangements just kind of Go Along.despite doing a Miles Davis Cover&Average White Band take nothing really stands out here.His Studio stuff in the 80's was cool.but upon listening to it now he sounds way too much like the radio.Sussido sounds way too much like Prince's 1999.the Guys on here can Play but it has no Soul for me.
3,Thankfully,"Phil Collins has always been a weak singer, good drummer and percussionist and long been a mediocre keyboardist. Thankfully this album does not showcase Phil Collins dry and rangeless voice. Instead its pretty much all instrumental which is its plus. Collins has assembled a strong group of musicians to help him out and came out with a acceptible instrumental jazz album. This album is far better then Phils horrid studio work but suffers the serious flaw of having many of the covers of Phil and Genesis pop songs still come out too poppy though there is a great live version of Los Endos at the end of the album, the best version out there."
1,Was Mr. Collins joking about this?,"What a rip off. This CD is pure garbage. If you grew up in the 1940s, then this album is for you otherwise don't waste your money on it. I thought this was a live Phil Collins concert. On the contrary. Sure he oversaw the making of it and even played drums on it, but it's not a Phil Collins album. This is pure trash and I deeply regret spending the money on it. It's not worth it. Like I said, if you like Big Band stuff, then this is for you otherwise don't waste your time or money on it."
2,A bit of a bore,"Dale Peck is an incredibly thoughtful, articulate and emotionally moving writer, but this piece fails him. His writing career, which i have followed from the beginning, has had its ups and downs, but the writing has always managed to keep things afloat. He has such a mastery of the language, its incredible. But this true story is a major drag, and you need a great deal of faith to keep going.Hopefully the next book will once again engage an interesting story with the poetics of his use of language."
3,"Smoldering Ballads, Well Sung","Giorgia, the Italian songstress, wraps her glorious pipes around a set of smoky and smoldering ballads here. The title track is her famous San Remo Festival award-winner. Her rich tones bring a power and depth to introspective songs like ""E Poi"" and ""Senza Segreti."" She sings quite a bit in English on this disc, as well - - the standout track is a Billie Holiday-ish take on ""You Don't Know What Love Is."" The cd's only flaw is a certain sameness of mood, really only broken by a rocking ""Nessun Delore"" and a pumped-up revisit to an earlier hit ""E C'e Ancora Mare."" Most of the disc suggests Giorgia as a love-lorn chanteuse in a smoky after-hours club in Milan."
4,Nice and tangy,Well this came just as expected nice and tangy lemon like flavor and scent. The only reason I rate it 4 out of 5 was because the grind was just a little to course for my taste.
1,Poor Quality,I love using sumac in my salads and the quality of this product is very poor. I think it must have been an expired product because it had no scent to it and to get any flavor I had to use 5 times as much. Will not buy from again.
3,"Enjoyable, but I skipped over the last few chapters","It was a good book, but a little too much misery for the characters and I found I was skipping over the last half to get to the ending. Still, it was okay."
2,too naive,"Kat Martin's writing style is just not my cup of tea, I guess. I found the book too naive and far from reality. This is a romance for people who want to dream more than to read a believable love story. Jessica was too perfect (even her imperfections were perfect once we learned why she was behaving the way she was behaving), the interaction between the hero and heroine was predictable (he just happened to be somewhere always when needed, accidentally) and the conflicts, however difficult they seemed, were always solved easily. I guess I am more a Lisa Kleypas, Meagan McKinney or Johanna Lindsey (not all of her books, though) person."
2,Boring...,"I do not know why, but this book started to bore me after the first 100 pages. I did not enjoy it at all. Thank God I just borrowed it. Don't want to spend my hard earned money on this. I will read the sequel to this book, nothing but velvet. I hope I have better luck."
1,Not acceptable,I found the shoes too heavy for tennis. The cover over the laces made it difficult to pull the laces tight. I cut off the cover and that made it better. The advertisement on the back of one of the shoes came off which wasn't a functional part of the shoe so it didn't matter. The strip is still on the other shoe. I wouldn't buy this shoe style again. I bought it through Amazon and had not tried it on before purchase. Barbara Reynolds
1,OK....but definitely does not come close to holding 36 pairs of shoes,"I would not recommend this product if you are trying to fit sneakers in this cabinet. I am a phys ed teacher and have a lot of sneakers and thought that this would be a great help. I wear a women's 9-1/2 to 10 and I could only get 18 pairs of sneakers in there (that is smashing them in there to fit), yet it says that it holds a men size 10-NO WAY! The top drawer in each cabinet barely hold flip flops and forget try to put away the heels. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone. Waste of my hard earned money :("
4,Does what it is supposed to do!,"I just received my grease gun yesterday and so far so good. While the manual doesn't do a great job explaining how to install the grease tube, or which way to twist the handle to release the plunger, it is pretty easy once you have it in front of you.Build quality seems great! It is very heafty. I was able to attach the nipple to my Seadoo drive shaft boot without issue. A very noticable click, a few pumps till grease came out and I was good to go. You need to twist and pull the fitting off so it may not work if you don't have enough working room to do so. This looks like it will last me for a very long time."
4,"Overall Very nice, coupler did piss me off though","My grease gun just arrived today. I couldn't wait to load it with grease and get going. Overall, it's a very nice unit. I like it much better than my old grease gun that had the long handle to pump it. After reading reviews here, I'm going to try loosening the coupler on the end of the hose. I did some greasing on my tractor and hated the coupler on the first zerk. It was locked on and I had to fight it to remove it. I re-read the directions and found nothing pertaining to loosening the coupler. My fault for not loosening the coupler but then again, it doesn't say anywhere to do it!"
3,Coupler is Impossible,This is a well made unit. I read other reviews dealing with the coupler. I tried to loosen the coupler. The knurled part wore smooth before I could get it loose. Had to go buy a different coupler. Should not have that kind of problem with the coupler on the grease gun.
4,Handy Tool,I purchased this Grease Gun when I installed new suspension linkage on my 5th Wheel RV. The order arrived in a very timely manner. I use it with Lucas Oil 10005 Grease. Both worked well together. The only problem I had was when I put the new tube of grease in I had a little trouble threading the head on. It took several attempts. Otherwise it worked fine. It is well made which is what I wanted because the new bolts I used have Zert fittings on them and I want to be able to lube them periodically. I would recommend this product to a friend.
3,Good considering its origin,"Initial quality is really good. I haven't ran a full tube of grease though it yet, but it works well. The fitting on the end is nearly impossible to attach and remove from my needle grease nozzle, but it does firmly attach to standard Zerk fittings.Contrary to what I've read on the internet about these being made in the USA, the box and instructions indicated it was made in India (better than China, but still slave labor), and the whip hose was made in Germany (indicated on the hose itself, they make good stuff so it's ok...). Being the patriotic type this was a bit disappointing to me, as I was thinking I was purchasing a USA made grease gun. We have to keep our American jobs here, by supporting each other, right?"
1,Don't buy this,"Don't waste your money. Directions are poor, difficult to load the grease cartridge. Coupler won't release from zerk as others have indicated. All in all, poorly designed and doesn't work well."
4,The Spoken/K2S track is the best song on the cd!,"not the worst....i love it...and k2s is not trying to be gangstas...the best part about the song is its so much different then everything else....I just thank the Lord for giving us spoken, cause edl has fallen of the face of the earth....and hey they were a dove award nominee!!(please don't let that be a turn off, its nice for our style of music to get some recognition)"
4,Alot like rage - but good christian lyrics,"Finally, a good christian rap-core band! However, they are just too much like rage for me to give them 5 stars. A little more originality is required."
2,Not so great,"I bought this CDROM after I read all the good reviews here.In my opinion, the method is not that effective.And it is not thorough since the Chinese caracters are simply ignored.Maybe the best way to use it is as a secondary source of training, but not more.Further, like all the CDROM based language method I have tried, the overall design is outdated. But again, this is not specific to LearnChineseNow9.0."
2,I don't believe the other reviews!,"I have this program and I am not impressed. It looks to me like the series existed and they just tried to make a Chinese version. The games and exercises don't work well for chinese. If you want to learn by memorizing dialogs that don't reflect everyday situations, this is for you.To get any use out of this as a beginner, I had to copy down the words and phrases and make flashcards on my own. There is no vocabulary drill, no vocabulary builder pages etc. I couldn't believe anyone buys this.I also have listened to pimsleur which is great. Another good though pricey piece of software is Wenlin."
3,"It was fun and entertaining in the beginning, but soon it turn sort of boring.","I had no problems getting started in this story, but soon it turn and got a little boring towards the middle of the story. From then on I had a hard time trying to stay interested. The story itself was well written, but the flow of the story became a bit stale. By the high ratings that the other reviewers have given this story, it might have just been me. For some odd reason this story just didn't do it for me. I didn't feel any chemistry between the characters, nor did I find the story line believable.Would I recommend this book? Probably not!"
4,Enjoyable,This was a fun book. It took me a while to know whichtwin was which but it was a thoroughly enjoyable book.
4,Fun romance,"I really enjoyed this book.It had a bit of suspense, romance and fun.The ""deceipt"" and how it unraveled was fun to read.I would recommend this one."
3,enjoyed this book,"I enjoyed this book and found it to be entertaining. It was a bit short but the plot moves along. Would have like a bit more character detail and insight into each one of the main characters. But all in all, a fun read."
3,It was an ok read.,"Not as funny as I thought it would be, it was still somewhat entertaining. It did take me a few days to complete because that engaging element was just not there, so I really didn't have a burning desire to finish it. Overall it was an ok read."
3,Predictable,"It was a good read, predictable ur it enabled me to lose myself for a while. I think u will enjoy it"
1,A dissident amongst the group...,"I'm very disappointed with this book for several reasons- #1) it shows the potty as a toy (on Sam's head, holding his toys, etc.). My 2 year old has never used the potty as a toy & I certainly don't want anyone giving her any ideas! #2) poor design- the pop-ups are cute, but they are much too delicate for chubby little toddler fingers & the book has quickly become demolished. #3) I wish the potty books should show kids washing their hands post-potty- it should all be part of ""this is what you do when you potty""."
5,"An excellent, indispensable resource!","This superb book offers a practical, helpful and comprehensive resource for women of all ages. The authors offer straightforward, up-to-date advice for prevention, assessment and treatment of osteoporosis. This treasure trove covers everything from risk factors to exercise, nutrition, calcium supplements and their impact on bone health, to recent controversies over hormone replacement therapy. The sections on Sexual Health, Osteoporosis in Men and Questions to Ask Your Doctor are excellent. Gates and Whipple make it clear that it is never too late and also never too early to take charge of one's own health. Outwitting Osteoporosis is indispensable for anyone seeking to insure a strong, active future."
1,Gourd leaks in less than a week,"Like several other reviewers I had a bad experience with the gourd leaking. Beware if you're buying this for a gift. The recipient may not want to tell you about the leaky gourd so you may think ""what a great gift idea"" when it's actually the worst, esp. if the gourd happened to leak on something that shouldn't get wet. I also agree with the reviewer who said the bombilla is a poor design. It does allow a LOT of bitter leaves to get up the straw and the yerba mate isn't very tasty either. I've emailed Guayaki through their website (guayaki.com) and complained about my leaky gourd. I asked for a replacement. I'll try to remember to post an update regarding their reply.UPDATE: I recieved a reply right away to my email regarding my leaky gourd. She sent me a replacement gourd free of charge and I recieved it within days. The new gourd works great and I really appreciate guayaki.com's excellent customer service."
3,Just ok,"I am halfway through the bottle. Personally I have a hard time remembering to take it an hour before I eat. But when I do remember, it does a good job of fending off hunger... for that hour."
1,Dont waste your money,"I purchased this product from amazon about a week ago. After reading about this product I was really looking forward to trying it. I took several capsules today and noticed a strange mint or eucaluptus smell that lasted for a while. I normally get ravenous when i get home from work, so i took a couple capsules an hour before getting home. Unfortunately this had no effect on my appetite whatsoever. I still felt like snacking before dinner, and I also felt abnormally agitated - as if i had low blood sugar. Unfortunately I paid for two bottles of this stuff - very dissapointing."
5,Love it.,"I have been taking irwin naturals triple tea fat burner but I also wanted something to help me to get through the afternoon without eating too much. I am extremely sensitive to even natural products, in fact with the acai berry I broke out in rashes. A lady at the health food store suggested this product and I started with one (I have to test the waters before I jump in) and felt a little less hungry and then took 2 (the recommended amount)and felt no hunger. I really like this product and find the combination of hoodia and the tea burner are working for me and would suggest them to my friends and family. In fact, I have. I find they are safe to take and if anyone was going to have a reaction it would be me. Give it a try, I am thrilled to find something that actually lessens my hunger, I am ravenous in the afternoon! ;-)"
2,a watch that came broken,"I purchased this watch as an aniversary gift for my husband. He loves Tommy Bahama name brand. The watch is nice , but came with the batery dead and the screws fell all of them. I can not even return it. I am very disapointed and I feel so ashamed that I couldn't surprise him with something nice. He can not have it and is just standing there on the counter reminding me about how unserios is Amazon.com"
3,You had better have a small wrist,"I bought this for my wife, who is 5'7"" and normal weight/bone structure. She can barely stretch it around her wrist. Not recommended for anyone with anything above an average female wrist."
2,Must have small wrist,"Beautiful bracelet, I was so hoping it would fit. Unfortunately, it is too small. Can some sort of extension be added so this can be wearable?"
3,"Entertaining, but a little heavy handed","Egalia's Daughters is fine and generally entertaining, but by the end the writing got a little heavy handed. I would even say it went from heavy handed to full-on corny and melodramatic.Certainly not terrible, but certainly not the best. Great theme and ideas, just not great execution. Then again, perhaps it was a matter of translation...?"
1,"After a month, cannot use","After a month of installing this deadbolt lock, it became very difficult to turn to the locked position. Even holding the door open, it was very difficult to turn it to the locked position. This lock received very light use. I used it once a day to lock the door going into the garage. I am going to order a more expensive (hopefully better) deadbolt lock and get rid of this one. I do not recommend it at all."
5,Scientific book bringing together economics and sexual orien,"As of the day of this review, Money Myths and Change is the main book bringing together economics and sexual orientation in a scientific manner.It is geared to a vast readership. Occasionally you might encounter tecnical words such as ""regression"", but the the arguments in the book are accessible to all."
5,One of the best PPV's the WCW produced,Solid pay per view which shows that WCW didn't need Hogan to be entertaining. The main event is great and the rest of the card was awesome. Great effort by everyone involved. Before the Hogan era so that should be enough for you to buy this tape.
1,The vocals need a lot of work,"The vocals need a lot of work, this is not a nessicary cd to purchase."
3,still growing on me,"I love the other ones. This one is still growing on me. After I bad mouthed it to a fellow fan and let him have it for a couple of weeks, I played it again and began to appreciate it more. It's not as depressed as I originally thought, either. As I get older, I'm realizing that much music does not reveal itself to me right away, and I only come to appreciate it on repeated listenings. Still, this doesn't seem to have the kinds of classic songs that the last 3 discs had. I guess I'd say to Freedy:' I love songs like ""The Mortician's Daughter,"" but it's nice to know that California Thing"" is coming up. You seem to have forgotten to mix up the pacing this time. Oh well, keep at it.'"
2,Not up to Freedy's high standards,"Although there are a couple of bright spots on this CD, I would recommend first-timers going with a more consistent and, frankly, better album, like This Perfect World. Johnston should have foregone the temptation to let T-bone Burnett produce the soul out of this record (as Burnett has done with other artists). It's sounding a little too baby-boomerish for my taste, rather like when Sting lost his mind and started putting out sclock. Then again, most of the blame probably lies with Johnston himself on this CD, not the production values. The songs just aren't up to par for this amazing artist, who had previously put out almost nothing but incredibly beautiful, restrained yet infectious songs. I just hope he gets back to business on the next record. Still love ya, Freedy, despite this one!"
2,Perhaps...,"Perhaps he needed to fulfill a contractual obligation. Perhaps the muse has gone AWOL. Perhaps he just has songwriter's cramp. Perhaps Jim Keltner and T-Bone Burnett were doing court ordered community service. Perhaps he's just saving his good stuff and plans to take over the singer-songwriter world with a breakthrough blockbuster release right around Christmas. Perhaps he's been short-changed and did not receive his full 15 minutes. Perhaps he's just really, really sad. Perhaps this disc is on the cutting edge of modern music and I just can't recogonize it. Perhaps it just plain stinks."
2,Disappointing new release from Freedy Johnston,"The new Freedy can't hold a candle to ""Never Home,"" let alone ""This Perfect World."" ""Blue Days"" left me wondering what Freedy was thinking when he decided to release this plodding collection of new tunes, with nary a keeper in the bunch. If you're looking for some music along Freedy's relationship/new york vibe lines check out Supple at Supple.com. Singer/songwriter Rob McCulloch has crafted an album's worth of great tunes that quite frankly put Freedy, at least in his current lackluster state, to shame."
5,BUENISSSIMO!,"...i JUST SAW BARBERIA AT ""EL VERANO DE TU VIDA"" (TV PROGRAM AT TELEVISION ESPAÑOLA), AND I THINK THEY ARE JUST GREAT! .... BEAUTIFUL MUSIC! T H I S!, IS GOOD LATINO MUSIC!"
3,"Too strong for car use, smells like men's cologne","If you want the overpowering smell of men's cologne in your car, then buy these. For me, it was too strong so I put it in my glove compartment to dampen the smell. That worked ok for a week."
3,"Powerful, but smells like cheap cologne","Points earned for being powerful. G-fab though, in that instructions say to leave the tree in its bag, tear the top, and adjust it's exposure from bag every week for 7 weeks. It does not look classy hanging from your rearview if you follow the instructions. This is to prolong scent, and so it doesn't knock you on your feet with its Hello! Brut aftershave scent. It reminds me of the Sav-On cologne I wore to my 8th grade promotion dance. It was all we had access to then, but now we're Amazon shoppers w/some disposable income, apparently, so step your car freshener game up w/something else!I would not buy this again. It is potent, though, if that's your primary objective. Any other recommendations for a more grown-up scent are welcome.Update 3 days later...the freshener has toned down a bit."
5,Fresh to def,This will make it car fresh to deaf. Black ice is where it's at because of the smell of it.
4,Italian pop/rap-if I have to classify-light & upbeat,"This is an album that grows on you. It incorporates a bit of pop, rap, piano, and some cool sound effects (Star Trek). Listening to it puts me into a good mood. I definately recommend getting it! I need to learn more Italian just to understand their lyrics. It's worth it, though."
3,Good to be able to find it.,"I went looking for the book on a recommendation from anothe writer. I am writing a book about a landlord. It was valuable to me to be able to find it as it is some years old. As a read it is interesting, but I might not finish it because my interest is limited to the author's intentions and point of view, technical questions. It is great that amazon makes such books available. If I went hunting in bookstores, I would never find this. About the copy I got: I knew I was buying a cheap used one but this copy had a grubby feel to it."
2,Try something else,"Poor organization makes this product difficult to use. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it's organization. It does have some redeeming features, like the ability to compary your voiceprint to the native speakers voiceprint, but this is of limited utility in actually learning to speak the language. I suspect the people who give this good ratings have lots of time to invest, and therefore can get use to the organization and quirks of the program. For the rest of us, there are easier ways to learn."
2,Learn Spanish Now,I bought Learn Spanish Now because of the favorable reviews but have been very disappointed for the following reasons:- No dictionary. I wanted to find the Spanish meaning for some English words and discovered there was no such capability. You have to buy a separate product for that.- I wanted to learn some basic things like numbers and days of the week and could find no way to do that.- The lessons seem to be totally random - nothing builds on previous lessons and there seems to be very little organization to the material.This program is bad enough that it makes me question the objectivity of other reviews about this product. Maybe it's time to shell out the cash and try the Rosetta Stone product.
1,Oh boy how I wish I could have seen Melrose Place 3rd Season!,"I have been trying to purchase Melrose Place 3rd season since December 2007! I have been charged twice in my credit card - and still no product delivered! Right address and everything, and still no Melrose Place 3rd Season! I have written Amazon several times, explaining that my orders were duplicated (yes, I have been charged for two Melrose Place 3rd season DVD's and still have not received the product - talk about consumer rights!)I even telephoned early February and talked to Customer Service and was promised to have the matters resolved and to this day - February 09, nothing happened... so I am sorry my review cannot happen even having I paid (several times) for my order, that to this date, did not arrive...Sorry!!!Ana Elisa RochaUnhappy Customer"
5,great dvd!!!!!!!!!,"the sound its great, the picture quality too!!! and the list of artists are incredible"
1,I just want the London show!!!,I have not purchased this set of DVDs. One reason is Im only interested in about 20 to 25% of it. I dont know that many will argue that the best show of all(London) you cannot buy on its own...I dont want 4 discs of of which only basically 1 I will watch. I dont listen to or watch MTV and Im not interested in over half of the other bands....I DO HOWEVER WANT THE COMPLETE LONDON SHOW and thats it! You would think that would be simple and they would sell even more copies. Id be willing to pay good money just for the London show. Until then I guess I can live without this set! Im not gonna jumble through 4 discs to hear the bands I want to hear.
5,El mejor de todos los DVD's del Live 8 despues de Londres,"Este DVD es uno de los mejores... tiene a Placebo, Muse, Craig David, The Cure y Shakira!!... Es una lastima q no hayan puesto ""La Tortura"" y solo incluyan Whenever, Wherever!... Igualmente este DVD es genial!!"
2,"Sí, que lindo , está Shakira....cuac",La Tortura hubiera sido si metían más canciones de Shakira.
3,Floyd Fans!!! Watch Floyd's set FREE!!! Save $30!!!,"First I want to say that that this product is a solid 3 stars. The musical performances vary in quality and entertainment. But personally I didn't care for many of the so-called 'artists.' I bought this solely for Pink Floyd's 5 song set. The songs that Floyd performs are Speak to Me, Breathe, Money, Wish You Were Here and Comfortably Numb and they do them all flawlessly. Seeing roger Waters into the music, smiling, singing along and engaging the audience is fantastic. Seeing all four members smiling to one another and standing together at the end is truly priceless. To say the least it was and will remain very emotional to any committed fan of Pink Floyd. However if, like me, you are only getting this to see Floyd then I suggest you simply check out David Gilmour's Youtube channel where he provides the entire performance in HD and FREE OF CHARGE. So if you only want the five songs from Pink Floyd just skip this DVD and watch it on Youtube."
4,exciting,"This video is more than what i had antiscipated. Needless to say, it kept me glued to the screne. I certainly would like to see more of Africa's talented musicians."
5,Incredible box set,"I was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances. I would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation--truly a ""must have"" for anyone's collection!"
3,Could have been better,"This is a fantastic concert, and is sure to please any music fan. Some really apparent problems to me are:- the high amount of video compression used. Several scences show blocks due to the amt of material squeezed onto the discs. Definitely not HD, and should only be watched on small screens.- the chopping up of artists' sets. Why leave out the Dido songs? What happened to REM's 'Imitation of life'. Green Day? C'mon how about the full set?- The extra Edinburgh show is great, but couldn't that one have gone as a seperate set, like Rome and Paris? I wish the full 4-discs could have been the Hyde Park show."
4,A good collection,"With the plethora of acts on the DVD, it's hard to buy this and be disappointed. Almost all genres of modern music are present, with ""pop"" and metal acts conspicuously absent for whatever reason. So whether you like The Who, Dave Matthews Band or Jay-Z, there is something here for you.My one complaint, as someone who was there, was that the song selection puzzled me. Not only was a significant portion of it presented out of order, but a lot of the bigger names, such as Linkin Park or Neil Youn, who did half-hour or 45-minute sets only have one song included while smaller acts get almost their entire set included, and several venues are woefully underrepresented - either shoved in the back as an ""extra"" or having one or two songs make the cut.This is a great collection, don't get me wrong. But to really do this concert justice, it needed at least another disc of content."
1,"Misleading, misrepresentation, one CD only not 4","This is misleading. Not the 4 disc set as described, just one 50 minute disc in French.Don't waste your time."
3,Anamorphic Video!!!,"Yes it is! I can't believe the packaging is wrong. If you were waiting like me since it was listed as as full frame wait no further, it is full 16x9 transfer! You can't ask for better video quality! I would have given it 5 stars if the whole Green Day set was included, but its not."
3,3m is a better product,"While these usually work, they break apart easily and probably 15 to 20 % are throw-aways.....3M are much better quality"
2,"Well-written, attractive, but it's missing a lot","Well-written, physically beautiful, and without a lot of the information this DP tyro had hoped to find in a prepress handbook. I suspect that the writer has been in the biz so long that it's tough to put herself in the shoes of the beginner. So: nothing on PDF settings, little on trapping, nothing on bleeds, etc.I'm new at all this. I had hoped to find that information in this book. I realize that all writers of technical manuals must decide what to include and what to omit -- Do you tell the reader how to install software? -- but I do think a handbook on prepress should have included much more than is included here. I learned nearly as much from the prepress section of about.com.I recommend this book to people who don't need to read it: graphics professionals who will enjoy Sidles' smooth writing and amusing anecdotes. But if you want hard info, you'd better look elsewhere."
5,To hear the voice of Laura Valente is an honor,"I first heard Matia Bazar in 1987, when Antonella Ruggiero was the voice. I was beyond impressed. The grace and sheer depth of her voice was like no other. Enter Laura Valente...Beyond impressed is too light a description for this Italian angel. This girl is rivaled by no one alive today. I get the chills every time I hear her voice. The band is amazing; these guys are seamless; one of the only bands in existence who are truly cohesive. If you don't own this recording, you are doing yourself a disservice. In Italian, but then again, Italian is the most romantic language that can be sung."
2,Over-produced album,"The only song I knew from this group was the '85 hit Ti Sento, which I saw was on this album. When I got it, however, it turned out to be a very bad remake. The original sounded fresh, this version is over-produced and isn't half as good. That's the problem with the rest of this album too, it just sounds as if people have tried to make it too perfect, if that makes any sense. I agree that the singer is very good, so it's a shame that she sings on this album."
3,okay,"Just a little FYI- Nintendo guns and accessories for the NES do not work on flat screen televisions...Now, as for the condition of my purchase, it wasn't worth the price! the cable was frayed and it had electrical tape arounda huge split in the insulation.I contacted the seller who told me to ship it back for another but i wasn't going to pay for MORE shipping for another item.Over all, the gun works on full sized televisions not on flat screens. It works so I rate this experience OKAY!"
4,Worried about the product...,"Came on to order this today but now I look and see there may be something wrong with the supply? This is very uncommon for Funimation material of any sort. I've been very happy with the other 5 I've gotten (no. 6 is on its way for me), but this makes me worry about getting this last box set. Does anyone know why amazon yanked their suppy after just one day on the market?"
3,Good supplier and product,"The supplier emailed me to check whether I wanted green or black berries which I thought was an impressive followup. The berries arrived in a plastic bag when I was expecting a glass container as per the advertising pitcure. However, all in all I was happy with the service and the product."
5,What Once We Loved,"What a wonderful story of a group of extraordinary women who overcome challenges and are made stronger for it. This book makes me think that giving up is easy but to persevere is a gift to each of us. We owe it to ourselves to not give up easily. When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
4,"Novel is Wonderful, but,..",The Kindle version was so riddled with typos (every few paragraphs had an error)that it was very distracting.The story itself was a wonderful conclusion to the series.
2,Lost Interest,"I loved Kirkpatrick's first book in the series, All Together in One Place, enjoyed the second, No Eye Can See (although not as much), and lost interest by this third one, What Once We Loved. I don't even think I'll finish it. The characters and their relationships are beginning to be too sappy for me."
5,A Gem and Historic Novel,"This little tome is a timeless classic dog story. Although written in 1899, the story reads as well today as it did then, when it was a best-seller and in print more than 10 years. Although considered a ""children's book"", the writing and storyline will entertain a person of any age. Byrd Spilman Dewey's writing style is flowing, elegant, and lyrical. Her characters are real; she is Julia and her husband Fred is Julius. Although not written to observe history, the book also tells of their pioneer days along Lake Worth in the Florida of the 1890s. The descriptions of pioneer life makes the book a good read for fans of Florida history as well. Although Byrd Spilman Dewey did not leave a huge legacy of writings, what she did leave us charms the heart in a very unique way."
2,Misguided attack,"Mr. Horowitz has a valid thesis -- that classical music in the United States was taken over by commercial interests -- but he subverts that thesis in an attack, misguided, misinformed, and mean-spirited, on a great conductor who tried to conduct music as it was written. If it were not for the thesis, this would get no stars."
4,Great movie if you don't mind subtitles.,"This movie is a must for Adrian Pasdar fans. It is done in Chinese with subtitles, but the plot and action are great."
3,disapointment!,"We purchased the tv in 2007. It was pricey but we also needed the specific size so paid the higher price. We were extremely happy and it's portability was an extra. No complaints at all until,a couple months ago, it started cutting off on it's own. And shortly after stopped working all together.You would expect to get more than 4 years from a tv we paid almost $500 for. I haven't found a place yet to see if it's worth fixing.Johnny -Washington, DC"
2,no local repair,"Had to send TV across the country for repair (haven't gotten it back yet). Cost 50 bucks to ship it there, Was unhappy that it would not turn on randomly. Have not got it back yet - so I am not sure how effective the repairs are going to be. When it worked it worked well - great picture. Was kind of disappointed that it didn't have PiP - figured any tv that hooks up to your computer would have it - I figured wrong. Next TV from a local vendor that provides service here.JackThey sent me a new tv - it has the same problem as the first one - sometimes you turn it on and it turns itself off - but at least this one will let me turn it on again. Watch out here."
1,Unbelievable!,"It is truly unbelievable that a book such as this is published in 2001 - racist in that all people have white faces until the author talks about foreign countries, sexist as only women are portrayed doing house work, and discriminating to vegetarians. (...)"
1,Unbelievable!,"I was appalled when a friend showed this book and I realized it was published in 2001. It is racist (there are only white facesin the book until we get to foreign countries), sexist (only women are shown doing house), critical of vegetarians (EAT MEAT to be a good citizen !!!) and for some reason printed in Hong Kong!!"
4,Figures...,"That this would be listed under ""humor"". Being a good citizen is a total joke!! If it weren't then why is the majority of the country acting as if it were? We will see who's laughing for those of you who are nine meals away from anarchy. As far as the book is concerned, I recommend it to those who are true and patriotic American citizens, just remember it's a bit outdated..."
4,Nostalgic and Ironic Fun.,"Cynical, sentimental and slick. I gave this to my dad and he thought it was a very sensible book. I found it demonstrates how paranoid we have become - imagine a society where a child could walk into a neighbors house alone and without an invitation? It also an excellent collection of old illustrations."
5,"A marvelous author, another amazing book!","If you've ever tried to grow up, Catholic or not, this book is worth reading. Martha Manning is a witty, insightful, charming author who makes you feel that she sat down and wrote every word in this delightful book in about an hour. Her style is almost whimsical but with her solid base in reality, with no pretense, she takes us on a hilarious and touching journey through her childhood, and her life. I almost called in sick to work so that I could keep reading!"
3,El Norteno,Chalino es el mero chingon de Sinaloa. I recomend this album to everyone even to the gavachos. Chalino y Adam Sanchez are two bad mothers that sing the real life of a Mexican. VIVA MEXICO!!
3,"Y'ALL IS PLURAL, YOU CRAZY YANKEES","A good read ruined by the stupid mistake made by too many Yankee authors.""Y'all"" is plural. Not singular. It's a contraction of ""you all.""It's like fingernails on a blackboard when (mostly Yankee, but other non-Southerners too) authors use ""y'all"" when addressing only one person.Would you say ""youse guys"" to only one person?Grrrr.....Ruined an otherwise good read."
1,useless to me,it doesn-t fit in my phone even though this is supposedly the battery for Siemens A70. . .frustrating!
3,Should I... Shouldn't I?,My friend purchased Spanish Now and loves it! I dont know whether I should spend my money and buy Swedish Now! Should I? Shouldn't I?
5,Tippy Toeing / Sing Me Back Home~Harden Trio,This CD is excellent quality. I purchased this item on LP back in the mid 60's and was so glad to finally see it available on a CD format. If you like good harmony from family members this is a must buy CD.
1,Where is J-Lo? Still in Da Bronx?,"the beat was kewl on some tracks just her voice got to me after a while, she sounded like she was being choked! ha anyway gave it to my brother since it would collect dust here. track 4 was interesting bye yall"
1,WHO IS THIS?,"Purchased this cd and selling it with everyone else that is here. I disliked her style, never heard of her and took a chance in buying this cd."
5,This is a terrific first CD from a very promising artist,"Salsa music is heavily dominated by male artists, although recently there have been a few new female voices (e.g. La India, Fabby, Mimi Ibarra, and Brenda K.) But rarely does one find such an auspicious debut by a female salsa singer that blends a sensitive, musical approach with raw emotion and sexiness. Cindy Lara approaches all her material with intelligence and taste. Although she has the pipes to belt with the best, she has carefully thought through her phrasing so that she caresses every note with a delicate touch that seems to come directly from the soul. In ""Huele a Peligro"", she clutches achingly to the phrase ""Estar contigo...."" A few minutes later, in ""Tu Regresaras"", she growls, ""Y TU LO SABES!"" All we need now is a ballad or two so that she can show off that fabulous vibrato. Buy this CD: You will fall in love with it, and with her."
5,excellent music strong vocals salsa in the true form,I found the band excellent the sound was great also I liked the transformation of a slow song to the salsa rythm smooth sounds like it was made to be played this way the singer is strong yet sexy
1,What a waste of money,"I was so looking forward to this book and it was such an utter waste. First of all there were glaring factual errors, second of all about 10 pages were just missing and lastly there is so much written about the Red Sox that this book offered nothing of any value. A complete and utter waste of time and so poor compared to the Yankees encyclopedia."
1,A huge disappointment,"I was looking forward to the release of this book for months. Unfortunately, it was a major disappointment.Unlike other team encyclopedias, this one focuses on statistical recaps rather than providing the anecdotes that make following baseball so enjoyable. For instance, the book mentions Jim Lonborg's decline after the 1967 season, but doesn't explain why (he broke his leg in an off-season skiing accident). Also, it has dozens of factual errors (Rick Aguilera started with the Mets, not the Yankees).It's a shame that such a half-hearted effort was made. True Red Sox fans will be tremendously disappointed by this book."
4,Trump is a genius!!!,"You can not deny that Donald Trump is a genius-he is able to make money in television with ""The Apprentice"", real estate deals,books, and the most important asset-the Trump name.This book, which is not as impressive as his last(How To Get Rich)could have been written by anyone. It is simply a compilation of advice from other business super-minds, skimping on advice from 'The Donald'. It is a very good read, but will only be on the bestseller list because of his most valuable asset-the Trump name."
3,Most of the advice are advice you've heard before,"The book is easy to read... but most of the business advice are advice you've heard before or are common-sense.It's a good, light read... but after reading it... you will probably not know any more than you did before picking it up.Common-sense principles like: ""Treat others as you would like to be treated"" and ""Work hard"" are repeated over and over by different contributors of this book.My advice: Buy it if you have a few bucks to spare.My advice on getting to the top: Be good to your parents, work smart, work hard, treat everybody as how you would like to be treated, sleep your way to the top. hehe"
2,Best Advise that you have been told before.,"249 pages of quotes, I bought the book online, save your money.There are 100 better books to read, this is padding to The Donald's wallet."
1,Boring to death,"Nothing new there, avoid at all costs, just a famous man benefiting from his fame. Short quotes that you can find better ones on the Internet."
2,Fluffy business advice,"Fluffy business advice that sometimes ranges from misleading to dangerous.An actual quote from the book""As much as possible, deal only with good and honorable people. If you deal with good people, you won't need a contract, and if you are dealing with bad people, no contract can protect you.""Sounds nice doesn't it? Comments like this are a wolf in sheeps clothing, this is just bad business advice from a guy who doesn't follow it. Donald marries girls with prenup contracts that are flawless and for good reason, is that to say that he marries people he believes are bad? No, he just writes fluff advice in his books that he doesn't follow. I'm sure that everyone of trumps deals are legally protected and so should yours get a real book on business and get yourself a contract whenever possible, it's just good business sense."
4,The best buisness....,"This book has very little, actually no advice from Trump. At first , Ithought it was cheap. But this book is filled with many humorous and interesting anectodes from buisness sucess stories.HIghly Recommended"
1,"Decent grease gun, poor packaging by Amazon","Nice enough grease gun. I have used these in the past and expect this one will provide good service too.I ordered this with some grease and a rack for an ATV. The grease was included loose in the package and the ATV rack crushed all of the cartridges making them unusable and making a mess of all of the other products ordered. I was able to clean up the other items with considerable difficulty, but the grease itself was a total loss. This problem was due to Amazon's packaging. The outer carton was in perfect shape. The grease should not have been placed in a package with another heavy, shifting item.Too say the least, I am very disappointed with Amazon's poor quality packing. This made for an expensive, messy and frustrating order experience.Still, the grease gun is a good item, just don't buy it with grease."
2,Buy the more expensive one!,"I thought, ""how different can this one be from the one that costs three times as much?""I don't actually know, since I have yet to buy the more expensive ones, but...The chrome finish on these comes out of the package with bumps and bubbles already evident. My guess is that they will crack and peel once rain starts falling. I'm pretty sure I'll be buying a new set from a different manufacturer before the winter is over.Should have just spent a bit more money and done it right the first time!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book was a big disappointment. I was looking for info to supplement the useless manual that came with the camera. The books was mostly general rehashed info abundantly available elsewhere with precious little about the camera itself. It looks like in the need to produce a book, not enough time was spent learning the camera and the book was filled with generalities which would apply to all cameras. Not only that, it was poorly put together with so many pages out of order it was difficult to follow. Furthermore, I think that the price plus shipping is excessive for a 98 page book that does so little."
5,"Great for beginners - less value for ""pro"" photographers!",This book is an excellent reference guide to photography in particular and the Olympus C2000Z digital camera in particular. Many of the pages are generic and can be applied to any camera because they explain specific photography terms such as aperture and shutter speed in great detail. This book will enhance the photography experience especially with the OLYMPUS C2000Z digital camera for beginners and even intermediate photographers can gain valuable insight into photography and their camera. It is not an in depth reference guide to the C2000Z and the general information provided is not what professional photographers need because they already know all of the information contained in the book. I beleive the book is a very good value.
3,read carefully,"well, i did not read the word ""kit"" properly. I assumed kit meant collection, no, it means put together yourself. Doesn't seem as if it will be a nice as it seems to look. Make sure you buy glue and have plenty of time to build your room."
2,Assisted Suicide and Flat writing,"I have to agree with the two and three star reviewers. This is a short story which is stretched out. Not the greatest writing, and although it is a fast read, since you know the ending from the start, there really isn't much point. The movie got a lot of acclaim when I was young, but I never saw it, and always wondered what the title meant. Now that I know it refers to euthanasia, I am not all that interested. Why the victim, who was an orphan and a sexual abuse victim in the Depression is depressed is clear. Why the protagonist grants her wish to be shot is not clear at all. Feh."
2,"See the movie, skip the book","They Shoot Horses Don't They? is a good example of creativity bringing a basically lifeless book into a stirring human drama on the silver screen. I found the book to be nothing more than a 15 page short story expanded dramatically through the use of pages that contain nothing more than the date and time. The book is supposed to be the recollections of a condemmed man but is instead a short, dull monologue devoted to lifeless characters and flat plot lines. While the plot certainly has some potential, as seen in the big screen version, anyone who watches the film and then reads the book is sure to be disappointed."
4,Classic dark gem,"Grim, fascinating LA period piece. Lurid American spectacle. Authentic slice of the Depression. Tight prose, driving plot line; straight-up noir without the froth. Couldn't put it down. Not perfect, but pretty close. 4.5 stars."
4,Short Story Format,"It feels more like a short story than a novel, mostly because the characters seemed so distant from their own lives. The only one I could sink my teeth into was Mrs Layman. She had heart and spunk. The dance marathon is one of the main characters, while the dance couple seems an unlikely match. I don't buy the ending (foreshadowed on the first page) that he kills his dance partner because she wants him to shoot her. An interesting premise with the dance contest as a major factor of the story but the motives didn't hold water for me. Decent character development, recommended but not a favorite."
4,"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?","I don't think I could spoil this book, because it spells it out from the very start; and I've heard it was made into a spectacular movie. This is an existential noir (I know, weird combination?) novella about two people looking for stardom in the great depression. In the hope of being discovered and the need for money they join a dance marathon. While John remains hopefully, Gloria sinks into a depression and loses all hope and eventually asked John to kill her. Because They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"
2,"""Not an American Voice""","To me, this CD is one of the worst in the ""American Classics"" from Naxos. I feel he doesn't have much of a personal stamp. Antheil sounds too much like Prokofiev and Shostakovich.(who he obviously admires) If you want to hear a great American classic, get the Creston Sym 1-3 or V. Thomson's Symphonies from the same series. Now that's memorial music!"
5,The freshest and best nuts you'll ever have!,I used to live close to Fastachi and went there often to purchase nuts for myself as well as friends and family for holidays and house warming. They roast the nuts there in the shop. The cashews just melt in your mouth they are so fresh. The mixes they offer are awesome. I personally love the cranberry nut mix. I was surprised and delighted to see they can be purchased here on Amazon! You won't be disappointed! Enjoy!
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased these nuts as a gift and was disappointed when they arrived in a small brown paper bag, not a nice tin or box as I expected. I would not order again."
1,Terrible.,"Don't waste your money, it is worthless! This is not a movie, but rather a bunch of jumbled shots. Awful!"
4,Not Exactly What I expected,"This CD is pretty good. It has back-up vocals but they are NOT the Spice Girls. They're way off beat in the ""I wanna,huh"" part in Wannabe. And at the end of Wannabe they don't do the ""slam,wah,slam,wah"" part or the ""Slam your body down and wind it all around"". If You Can't DAnce doesn't give you enough time to do the Spanish Rap but you should buy it for such a cheap price!"
2,NOT a Karaoke CD!,"As described, this is a CD of instrumental versions of lots of Spice Girls hits to sing along to. It's NOT, however, a CD+G disc--the lyrics don't display on-screen in a karaoke machine. If you're just looking for the music and already know all the words, this CD will work, but if you want the full-on karaoke experience, look somewhere else!"
3,It was okay,"This cd wasn't the greatest. The music is okay because it sounds almost like the real cd. If you listen closely, the ending to these songs are acutally better than the ones on the SPICE cd because they don't just fade out. If you sing Wannabe at the right pace, after you say ""I wanna, I wanna..."" the backup singers are off a beat in the ""huh, huh, huh..."" But it's not that bad.~*Rachel*~"
5,OUTSTANDING HISTORY,"This work has received extraordinary recognition, and deserves all the prizes it has won. I have only read 10% of the volume, but feel like it is the most meaningful history I have ever read. I highly recommend it."
5,Hard-core basketball fan,"""Forever Showtime"" is the best basketball biography I've had the pleasure to read. Phil Berger captures in vivid detail the life of Pistol Pete Maravich-- the basketball player and, until he found religion, the tormented soul. Pistol Pete was special, and so is this book."
5,A Winner,Phil Berger does a solid job here on Pistol Pete.Pistol was something else.He did things on the court that still haven't been done since.He was a Bit ahead of His time.if He were out now He would be in another world all together.a solid read here.
4,The game that started a legend,"I love this game! Play as Ash on the origional quest to become Pokemon Master. If you plan on getting Yellow, DON'T DO IT! IT WILL BE A BIG WASTE OF MONEY! Instead, get this game, you'll be glad you did."
4,Poke'mon Blue,"This is a really good game except for you can't catch every single Poke'mon. Otherwise, it's tons of fun to play again and again."
4,ITS REALLY COOL,"I think pokemon blue is cool.like in the red vertion you get to choose between three starting pokemon: bulbasaur, squirtle, and charmander[I usally pick charmander].I think pokemon blue is better then pokemon red because you can get all my favorite pokemon [pikachu, meowth, psyduck, charizard, ratata, butterfree, and mewtwo]. its really cool try it."
4,Pokemon Blue,"It is a good game for long road trips, but it takes FOREVER to finish a game, you have to be very smart to figure half the stuff out! I recomend this game for teens and adults, not young children!"
2,"Shipped Fast, Game Defaulty","I ordered this game b/c i enjoyed the Red Version so much and i wanted to capture the Unique pokemon in blue version. However, when i received the game and put it into my game system it turns on but u can't start a new game or Talk to anyone. I don't know what would cause this but either the game is defaulty or something is up. Won't be buying this online unless its from a game dealer."
4,Pokemon Blue Entertaining and a lot of time,"I enjoyed playing this game, it was fun catching all the different types but it took a whole lot of time. But for those who have time I recommend this game."
5,the best game ever made,"pokemon red and blue are the best. I hate the new versions because they took out all the good pokemon, like Charizard,Blastoise, and even Mewtwo. In pokemon blue youre ash, who tries to beat all the gym leaders and try to beat the elite four. It's not that hard to beat, but to get all the pokemon is extremly difficult without using a game shark.i've had this game for 5 years and am still playing it now, on my Sp. You should buy this game if you haven't already. ruby and sapphire are pathetic. it only took me 17 hours to beat it. Get blue version, it's worth it."
4,Pokemon Blue,"It's a good game, the story line is very close to maching the show. It is definetly a game that will entertain you for a long time. The graphics could use a little improvment. But like I said, it is a good game."
2,it not as good on tv,This game can really get boring sometimes. the scenery never changes it seems like. Plus after you fought everyone your mostly done. Iwould not reccomend this game to somebody
2,?,Pros;It worksCon;Small corny graphicsThere is no action whatsoever(it's more like a little maze game)When they ask if you would like to battle in the arena it dosen't workJust dumb!Overview;Piece of ''okay''DO NOT get the other games like the red version or gold version because I have played them and they all STINK!
2,The Most Boring and Over-Hyped game of our time,"Many people say that Pokemon is the ""Best Game Ever."" Well, sadly, it isn't. The basic game is to easy, and is sometimes boring, with pokemon constantly jumping out at you. Also the main point of the game is dumb, the only point is to 'Catch and Battle Pokemon.' If your a skiled gamer, the game is short, but if you are inexperienced, the game is long. Overall, if you are the kind of person that can get caught up in a stupid, dumb game like this, go ahead and buy it. But if you have any sence at all, you should steer clear of this game"
1,Pokemon Blue,"Obviously I don't like this game.But Pokemon Yellow is cool.The dull color and horrible music make this game worse.Pokemon Red is a little better.It was cool in the begining, but now I realize it's plain old BORING."
5,One hell of a guilty pleasure!,"It's true that Pokemon is pretty much a passing craze due to (for some odd reason) the invention of TOO MANY POKEMON! However, this game is amazing. The graphics, attack animations, and sounds are very simple compared to later installments of the series, but who cares? At the time, this was like nothing anyone had ever played! The music is extremely catchy, and there are so many things to collect, you'll just find yourself playing for hours. Also, you can trade Pokemon from other people since the Red and Blue versions have Pokemon exclusive to that version. Also, if you feel the need to ""catch 'em all,"" trade starters, or evolve certain Pokemon with a trade. The bottom line: it's a great guilty pleasure and introduced what is now the most faded franchise ever!"
5,Good but not AS good as the Yellow Version,"Hi people,Today I will be reviewing an awesome game that can work with the original Game Boy Platform. NOTE: this does not work with the OLD SCHOOL Stupid Nintendo DS Lite :P.You start off the game in your house, then you walk out of your house and then southeast toward a patch of grass, then prof oak turns you in to a lab for the choice of 1 of 3 different trainer Pokemon.Charmander=Level 16 Evolution=Charmeleon=Level 36 Evolution= Charizard(Fire Flying) (strong)Squirtle=Level 16 Evolution=Wartortle=Level 36 Evolution=Blastoise Water (tough)Ivysaur=Level 18 Evolution= Ivysaur= Level 32 Evolution= Venusaur Water (Semistrong+Semitough)after that you do a few chores for prof oak then get a few items go to the woods that lead to pewter, beat brock, then later the real challenge comes in, I used a level 100 Dewgong and totally owned Bruno with Aurora Beam.Catch a Dewgong because it is better than a Blastoise."
4,I think it is fun!,When I got this game I played and played and played. I could not stop. And when I got the players guide it was even more fun. The idea is to go from gym to gym getting badges and when you have all 8 you can finish catching all 150 pokemon. I myself have a pokedex of 127. It may not be educational but it is fun for kids. I don't think adults would get into this game.
4,Pokemon,I really enjoyed pokemon and I have played it for about 150 hours to catch all 150 pokemon. The only thing i did not like is that the music was so annoying i had a hard time sleeping that night because of it. another thing that i did not like is after a while it gets boring and you do not want to play any more.
3,It's Pokemon *odd look*,"Pokemon: Pocket Monsters in Japan. I did love this game, but now, 8 months after I bought it beat it 14 times, it's just not fun anymore, I can't say it's the worst game, but it just gets really boring after beating it a few too many times. If you haven't bought this game, you should, or at least wait til October 16th to buy Pokemon Gold and Silver. I do recomend this game, but don't overplay it. You'll just say it is a waste of money. *sigh*"
3,I've seen better.,"When you begin the game it's fun, but the further you get into the game the worse it gets. First you waste bucks on the game. Then you find out that you have to buy a cable link to get 150 pokemon. Then you buy game shark to get all the really strong pokemon. Instead of having to buy one thing to play a game, you buy three things."
2,Great at the start but later...,"This game is awesome when you choose your Pokemon at the beginning but it gets boring later. It's cool fighting the trainers, but you can only fight them once (except for the Elite Four.) This game starts off as a best-seller, and drops down to an instant 0 in seconds!"
4,A really good game,"I think this is a really good game. It is like the other pokemon games if you've ever played them, and it is really cool getting new pokemon and battling opponets. However, unless you're really farmiliar with the pokemon world, and other pokemond games, you NEED to get the guidebook, or else you will have no idea what you are doing!"
4,"Fun, but with fatal glitch near end of game.","Yep, the game that started it all. You've probably played it before. It's great fun if you don't care about graphics, but I am docking one star off because of the MissingNO glitch. You can learn about it at www.dazzled.com/trsrockin"
1,Picture is deceiving,"When I ordered this item, I went mostly by the picture. If you read the small print then you might realize that it is only one single item, not all five. I called and tried to get them to send me the rest but they would not do so without another shipping fee. If only I had realized it was only one of five items I would only have paid one shipping fee. So my opinion is poor customer service and a deceiving picture."
4,Worthwhile watching,"I am an avid reader and documentary watcher of WWII history but this is the first I had ever heard of this interesting history of aerial spying and its role in taking out Germany's rocket program.I must admit that another reviewer's questioning of the accuracy of the history gave me pause but regardless of the accuracy of the politics, the ability to see the footage of the old photos, the ruins of the rocket sites and the original model created from stereoscopes made it a very worthwhile DVD.BTW, I assume any WWII buff will already be familiar with the Foyle's War DVDFoyle's War: Set 1 (The German Woman / The White Feather / A Lesson In Murder / Eagle Day)series, but just in case you aren't, do check it out. Like this DVD, it takes lesser known aspects of the war and shares it in a compelling fashion."
5,CODE GEASS: R2 I Love It,A must have for anyone who likes the CODE GEASS: LELOUCH OF THE REBELLION series. This CODE GEASS: R2 part 4 dvd contains the final 2nd season episodes. Its The FINALLY! If you don't already have it you must Get It.
3,"Good picture, sound already has problems","I bought this TV in August. I think the picture is very good. However, what has happened is that the left speaker keeps cutting out. However, when I disconnect the left audio patch cord, both speakers keep playing with the left one cutting in and out. I have read another review with this mentioned at Circuit City so I am guessing there might be a problem with this. I didn't get the extrended warranty so I am stuck unless I want to pay for labor which will cost more than the parts I am sure."
5,Awesome!,"Hilarious, clever and catchy. I find myself humming all the tunes while I'm at work. A must have for horror/musical fans!"
5,hilarious!,"this musical was hilariously amazing! it's based off those old horror movies, called evil dead, about a bunch of kids who go up to an abandoned cottage for spring break aannd get attacked by zombies. the songs are catchy and funny, though in my opinion better watched than listened to, but we won't complain about the awesomeness. i recommend that EVERYONE go see the musical as it's really funny, and after you do that you'll want the cd, because yes its that good. it's like rocky horror picture show, that kind of thing, except you laugh in this one."
4,What The F&%K Was That?,"i saw this show when it was in NYC...i highly recommend buying this CD. The music is really well done, and very funny. If it ever makes it back to the states(currently getting ready for a run in Toronto) be sure to check it out! I'm only giving it 4 stars because it looses some of its impact when you listen to the cd without ever seeing the show."
1,Evil Dead: For Fans Only,"The score to this show is atrocious. It reminded me of a bad musical episode of South Park: bad prosody (in other words, the lyrics don't always scan with the music), an over-reliance on assonance (in other words, the lyrics don't always rhyme), and puerile melodies (in other words...well...you get the idea). You might say, well, it's supposed to be bad. Sorry, I don't buy that. The great thing about Bat Boy, Reefer Madness, and Little Shop of Horrors -- three shows that Evil Dead would like to be when it grows up -- is that they have quality scores, although Reefer isn't quite in the same class as the other two. You can tell that there's genuine theatrical knowhow behind the scenes. Of course, I have the Evil Dead CD. But I can't imagine listening to it very often."
4,Great fun!,"A great recording of a fun show. Don't look for earth shattering lyrics, or unique music. Do look for a fun time - and be sure to read along with the booklet in the jewel case if you are an Evil Dead the Musical newbie. Don't listen with young children in the vacinity."
1,Empty packet!,"The CD arrived perfectly packed and sealed in cellophane 10 days ago.When I opened the case it was EMPTY!! Very hard to register a complaint to Amazon through webmail, so posted the empty package back snail mail.No reply so far. Poor show Amazon!"
2,It's ok,I got this game and played it a couple times and it was ok at first but it got boring after I figured out the trick on how to win. The frogs are kewl though.

1,Returned the Magellan and Purchased a Garmin,The product would not load with Windows Vista as Megellan has not developed a driver. I returned my Magellan 500 and purchased a Garmin HCx with the card for SE topo. I was unable to return the MapSend Topo and was out $34.
4,Aunt Vesta is finally getting married!,"Sabrina Spellman's Aunt Vesta is a magical witch. But she has a surprise! She's getting married to a mortal (someone who has no magic)! So Sabrina has to train Vesta to do things the mortal way. And it won't be easy.... I rated this book four out of five stars because I know that it couldn't have been better, even though it was already pretty good. If you enjoy Sabrina books, you might want to check out: ""Eight Spells a Week"", ""All That Glitters"", ""Scarabian Nights"", and ""Millenium Madness""."
4,Its a good book,It was okay i suppose. it was a shock when her aunt vesta turned up and decided that they were all helping with her weddng and that The wedding was actually going to be at their mansion house.
5,beyond fantasy,"I like for a movie to take me away, from my ordinary life. This film does just that. I love Nicolas Cage. While I don't agree with the casting choice for the kid, I really liked the film. Good direction with the effects. Not too much. I think overall it's a great story line and opened the ending so that there could be a sequel or pre-quel! I like an actor that can bend him/herself to any genre. That is what Cage does. Just as this film gives us a What if senario. Good subtle humor and action along with ""what's going to happen in the end"" feeling. A big recommend from Me!"
4,a surprisingly good movie,"I approached ""The Sorcer's Apprentice"" with low expectations, anticipating a Disney ripoff that would ultimately annoy rather than entertain me. I was delightfully surprised to find that it is actually an effective dual love story that ends with a romantic connection through time.The Apprentice in the title is a nerdy young kid who becomes the protege of ancient Wizard Nicolas Cage, whose performance is so low-keyed, it's astonishing that it works. Without divulging the plot, this is a journey through the arcane and the wonderful, involving magical devices of all kinds.I'd recommend giving this one a look-see; it's well produced with startlingly decent effects, and is a good evening's entertainment."
4,an enjoyable distraction,"this may not be the most intellectually stimulating or engrossing story, hell it dosent even have the best graphics, but it is fun, the story is a new take on some old fables, the dialogue is witty and the characters are an interesting bunch, overall an enjoyable movie, if u just wanna sit back and have some fun this is a good call"
2,Tipical Disney Movie....,Typical Disney Movie aimed at kids. Not of the same caliber as Toy Story or Monsters Inc but ok to watch.
5,Just as expected!,Never saw it before! Good movie! Cage's appearance gives the movie some credibility. It was worth the money spent in it.
4,An adventure and Nick Cage isn't totally annoying,"While this film has nothing to do with the Sorcerer's Aprentice piece of Fantasia, it was a fun watch and one that we'll see again. Very enjoyable popcorn movie, not a deep thinker. Just sit back, relax, suspend disbelief and enjoy."
5,excelent movie,"very good movie when watched i have never seen it in theater but had borrowed it from friends who owned it so i decided to buy one for myself and purchasing it threw this company, threw amazon was worth getting it cheaper then any other place where it would have cost me more. thank you for the safe shipping to send it to me."
4,Good Fun.,"This latest film from Walt Disney Pictures & Jerry Bruckheimer Films is pretty good fun. I like Nicolas Cage, Alfred Molina and Monica Belluci. Teresa Palmer was pretty good as the love interest. The lead actor Baruchel, I think, wasn't that good. But there were some good moments. My advice: rent this film. Rated PG."
4,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"cute fun movie-wish it was less ""cute""and had more ""meat to it"" but enjoyable (has a few fanboy moments in it (from Fantasia segment - The Sorcerer's Apprentice)"
2,Will Rate Later...,"I've seen bits and pieces of this movie on tv, and caught my interest right away!! I haven't watched it yet so can't rate it. Altho I'm sure it will be everything I had hoped it would be. As always, the movies came thru fine and were right on time for their delivery!"
3,1 disk,So in title of this prodect it says 2 disk bluray dvd combo but all I got is 1 disk that plays blu ray. The movie is good but not getting the dvd sucks.
2,more of a rental then a purchase,I watched this movie in the theaters and I have to say it was the first time I've ever fallen asleep at the movies. I thought it'd be a cool movie cause Nicholas Cage is in it but boy was I wrong. I can't remember the movie and I watched it a few months ago so it's that bad. Rent it. Don't buy it.
1,Awful,"Even worse than the director, Jon Turtletaub, usually makes. Jay Baruchel is usually pretty charming and here he looks like a Borscht Belt hack. Nicholas Cage seems to have forgotten how to act (plus let's face it, he's just creepy). Molina, who is an extremely good actor, has been made to look like he never's been in front of a camera before."
2,"Sorcery, but no magic","This is definitely a summer movie, the kind to watch when the theater's air conditioning holds as much attraction as what's on screen. The special effects were specially effective, I have to admit, but the whiny, nasal nerd with the pompadour didn't do it for me. And, with that lab he had, I would have expected at least the dog to be named Igor. (Is Dave really the kind who'd keep sports equipment in his science sanctum?) That cleanup scene - well, a certain well-known mouse already owns that. Teresa Palmer did a great job being cute and saveable, but her big moment at the end just didn't fit her character all that well. And so on - there wasn't much actively wrong with the movie, just not much very right with it.The audience, when I saw this, consisted largely of parents with kids in the 8-10 range. It was probably great for them (the kids, I mean). I could have passed on this one.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters."
1,Utter Garbage,"I don't understand how any sane person could enjoy this movie. Having been forced to watch it, I can say without hesitation that this movie is truly awful. The acting is pretty bad, although Nicholas Cage gets a special mention for playing the same character he has played in every movie he has acted in over the past twenty years. Is Nicholas Cage even capable of playing a character besides the ""wise mentor with a dark past"" at this point? The special effects are only decent, making any value this movie might have had irrelevant."
1,Who ever cast this movie should be sued,"This movie would have been ok (not really good but ok) if they had not cast a terribly homely kid with ZERO charisma, no acting skills or any perceivable talent of any kind for the lead role. It might not have been as bad had the kid (Jay Baruchel) SHUT UP at least for a moment or two during the movie. All I can remember is his whining and more whining................ Oh my God he's annoying! Through part of the movie it seemed he was trying to channel Jerry Lewis but that didn't work for him at ALL. Jay Baruchel SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! Jerry Lewis was comedic genius. Jerry oozed charisma unlike Jay.Please someone take Jay Baruchel out of the movies so he can't ruin anymore movies."
2,Hard to Follow Plot,Fair movie however the plot was disconnented and hard to follow. Over the top special effects. My grandkids liked it however. Not worth buying the dvd.
1,This movie is lame.,This movie was so lame. What hero do you know that gets their powers at the end of the movie. So so so lame. I am definitely going to look at other people reviews to see what they say. A waste of money.
1,The Sorcerer's Apprentice,"Even though this is a kids movie, I was looking for some light entertainment. Unfortunately I didn't find it with this very, very, very, very bad movie. I made it 2/3's the way through the movie before I chucked the DVD into the recycling bin. At least now it has a chance of providing some good for the environment. Spend your money on something else you can enjoy, because this movie is definitely not worth it."
1,So badly made I stopped watching after 5 minutes,"Looks like it was made by college kids in a media class. Hodge-podge special effects, acting so bad its almost comical, but not funny enough.Cage, you are better than this!"
4,Sorcerer's Apprentice a fun way to spend an evening.,"I've watched this movie several times now and it never fails to elicit a few enjoyable laughs. It doesn't take itself too seriously (it is a comedy, after all!) and it provides a good excuse to pop some corn and relax for a couple of hours. I especially appreciate the minimal amount of swearing in the movie, which in my book is a plus for any movie! Although there are a couple of ""dark"" scenes (eg., the fight between Merlin and Morgana; knives through a car's windshield), the movie doesn't spend any more time on them than is necessary for plot or character development. (The only other ""down"" side to the movie--if such it is--comes after the credits, with the short clip that suggests a sequel but which, to my knowledge, hasn't yet been made. Hey Disney, I'm waiting!) In the end--and in classic Disney fashion--the bad guy (and gal) loses, the boy gets the girl and everyone lives happily ever after. And that's a nice way to finish off an evening."
3,Cast can make or break,"Almost all principal cast is excellent.Molina is a great actor, he does from comedy to drama with wonderful subtlety. Cage is an Actor with a capital A, he sure can act. He is a little strange in his preferences, tending to the supernatural and fantasy. Belucchi's screentime is minimal, but whenever she's on, she is fenominal.Dave (Jay) is such a strange choice. It is clear that director wanted laughs and humor from the actor's nerdiness. I dont know if the actor is lacking or the direction was misguided, but all the supposedly funny moments were nearly unwatchable. I am one of those people that doesnt like seeing others embarrassed. Pretty much everything Dave did and said was nerdy in an embarrassing way, not funny/cute way. Even though I liked the movie and enjoyed the 3 actors very much, I cant rate it very high. To me Dave's casting broke the movie. Pity."
4,Not Great but Good,The Sorcerer's Apprentice was a well done and well paced film. It is not great in that it is fairly predictable but it is still enjoyable. The special effects are good and the director does not let them get in the way of the story or run over the characters.
5,Fantastic Fantasy for the Family,"A fun movie good for all ages. Really, the movie didn't get the credit it deserved from the critics. The characters are likeable, there's plenty of action, magic and even a love story. Definately worth it!"
3,The Sorcer's Apprentice,I am glad I added this to my collection. It should be in everybodys collection who is a Disney fan. Also mr. cage and cast dose a good job telling the story.
4,"Liked it, but thought it could have been better","Thought it would had been better with the caliber of actors in this movie. I did enjoy the movie over all! It makes a nice addtion to my vidieo library, for my grandchildren and myself"
4,Great family movie!!,"To all of you out there that read this review, and remember seeing the trailers for this movie; I know that you, like I was, probably thought what a campy little Disney movie. Looks like they are trying to build up their old line-up with human-acted movies.The answer is yes, this movie is a little campy, but it also makes fun of itself and also adds a lot of humor for the older generations that will be watching this. And, I think that with this movie, G-Force (to some degree) and the Pirates franchise (all of them Jerry Bruckheimer productions, I might add) Disney is reasserting its place in the modern movie landscape with classic stories that are designed to entertain and enthrall the whole family.So, get this movie however you want, rent it, Netflix it, Amazon VOD, PPV or just buy the thing out right; however you choose to do it, it will instantly become a great family movie and help you to do something that is often so rare in today's cultural landscape, Family Time."
4,Good,"Very fun movie. Cage was ok in it, I wish he would ""act"" more instead of just a blank face most of the time. I would not watch it more than once, but I enjoyed it."
5,Simply a great movie,The acting was great the special effects were top notch and a decent plot to keep you interested in watching it again and again.The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a movie that I think most if not all the family will enjoy well at least those over the age of 10.I loved this movie and will be buying it for Christmas. I watched this with VOD and am pleased the quality of the movie.
4,"A good movie, I was expecting something more though","I enjoyed this movie. I guess after just watching How to Train Your Dragon and The Last Airbender, the magic just got old. But if I had watched this movie first, I would have given it 5 stars probably. I just really enjoyed How to Train Your Dragon because it had more funny parts. But this movie is definately one to watch. The magic is much better in this than it is in the Last Airbender. Anyways, this is a movie to check out."
2,Horrible,"This is by far the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. Terrible casting, terrible acting, nothing is very good about this movie at all. No wonder it went to dvd so fast."
4,Going to Buy it,"I like Disney - most of the time.I like Nick Cage - some of the time.I had no idea who the apprentice was until he spoke.The good news is that the combination of these three worked and it worked well (once I adjusted my ears to the tones of the apprentice's voice). I seldom go see movies anymore because there isn't much worth seeing (too much skin, language, violence and NO plot) I was pleasantly surprised by the acting, pleased with the CGI and happy that it had a plot and not just dialogue between special effects. I would really like to see Cage do more of these kind of roles. I also liked the fact the 'nerd' proved he was interesting without the use of constant biting sarcasm. Even the 'girlfriend' proved she wasn't as shallow as she appeared to be. Overall, it was worth seeing."
5,the sorcerer's appreentice,great movie and I like that it is well put together need more just like it. hope there are more to come
3,good for airplane watching,This was a fun and entertaining way to pass a boring ariplane ride. This is a great movie for kids and/or tired parents.
1,Such a sad embarrassment for Disney,"Wow! What a shallow, predictable embarrassment for the Disney folks. I feel bad for the big name actors in the film. Their performances were fine of course, but even their talent couldn't save such a vapid absence of plot. The movie was empty. Flat. Shallow. I'm having difficulty describing the movie without letting Turret's Syndrome get the best of me. It's almost impossible to describe this film without the use of profanity. If I could sue Disney to get back the 109 minutes of my life I wasted watching this, rest assured I would. There is now a massive black hole in my sole, and I don't think even watching Robert Iger fall into a puddle of ostrich vom would make me feel better, but I'd be willing to watch it just the same."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"The Sorcerer's Apprentice is a great story that is absolutely destroyed by Disney. When a movie starts out with swords and wizards in the 8th century, and then all of a sudden jumps to a kid on the school bus with Jimmy Eat World playing in the background, you know you're in for some trouble. This story is about a Sorcerer, looking for his mythological apprentice, to fight an evil that could destroy the world. The film stars action veteran Nicholas Cage. It's got a huge budget for lots of cool special effects...and Disney turns into a kids movie with a farting dog, a fantasiaesq cleaning scene, and of course a nerd who becomes a hero. It had such potential, but turned out to be such a Disney Cliché that I wanted to vomit. Sorcerer's Apprentice is another great story completely destroyed by over the top effects and garbage from the money hungry giant known as Disney!"
3,Really for Teenagers,It felt like a drawn out after school special about believing in yourself. How a guy like that can get a girl like that is only for the movies thb. 3 stars.
3,Sorcerer's Apprentice - Worth seeing but not mind blowing....,"This is one of those movies that you wouldn't mind seeing once but that's it. It's FINE for fantasy film buffs and Star Wars fans but for your average movie goer, you'll likely be disappointed. It's not the best work by Nicholas Cage and the other protagonist leaves something to be desired."
2,disappointed,"Rent, don't buy, if you are curious about this movie. The storyline is pretty predictable, yawn. I feel like I have wasted 109 minutes of my life with this film so hopefully no one else will have to suffer the same fate. Jay Baruchel (the apprentice) looks much better on the cover than in the movie. Where did they find this guy? The way he laughs, OMG, is so so annoying. He is supposed to be this nerdy physics genius but he sure does a lot of stupid things. I give it two stars for Nicolas Cage and his giant eagle."
5,A Winner!,I saw previews for this when it was at the theaters but was not able to go see it. I was thrilled to find it available for rent on Amazon. I enjoyed renting it so much-I just ordered the DVD version of it. That doesn't happen often. Disney still has the magic!
3,Magical,"Hi: Lady's and GentlemenThis is yet another great Disney adventure! It is a fast paced action adventure. This a great family movie for all ages, but don't leave the room after it starts or you will be lost. This time you need to get your popcorn and soft drink before the movie starts. It just explains too much to leave the room. I hope you enjoy it! I did."
2,Mediocre Effort by Disney,"I guess this was supposed to be a big Summer movie; but the main character, played by Jay Baruchel, was so annoying that it made the entire movie a chore to watch. They should have called this movie ""The Sorcerer's Tetchy Apprentice"". The main character, who literally is a mental case in the beginning of the film, complains through most of the movie.Nicolas Cage, who plays the sorcerer, groggily drifts through this movie. He looked like he was watching himself in this movie - bored. There are lots of magical special effects here, some are better than others but there is nothing really outstanding in this film. This movie seems like it was made by a committee of marketing executives. Unless you are a Nicolas Cage super-fan, pass on this one."
2,Lame storyline but Good Special Effects,"the storyline is old hat, there are big gaps in continuity, the editing isn't as good as it should be and Nicholas Cage is dreadful but not as dreadful as the nerdy guy who plays the lead or the blonde actress who needs remedial acting lessons. I felt bad that Alfred Molina had to sink so low...his evil shines and he steals every scene from Nicholas Cage who doesn't even bother to phone in his performance."
4,MY 900TH REVIEW!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was a little bit better than I expected. It was very entertaining, and had a decent storyline. The only thing that annoyed me was Dave Stutler's voice. Nicholas Cage stars as a Sorcerer named Balthazar Blake who has imprisoned evil sorcerers in a Grimhold. In the year 2000, Balthazar meets Dave and gives him a dragon ring. 10 years later in present day, Balthazar returns for Dave, and an evil sorcerer named Maxim Horvath is released. Dave is trained by Balthazar to use his powers with the help of the ring. Balthazar and Dave must stop Horvath from releasing Morgana le Fay. I would definitely recommend THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE!!!p.s. It's been great writing 900 reviews, and I look forward to writing 900 more."
3,Somewhat predictable in plot; good comedy though,"Disney likes wizards; they've done a movie incarnation of wizards at least once a decade starting with the original Fantasia. Going thru films such as Fantasia 2000, the Sword in the Stone, The Black Cauldron, and Aladdin, we now have a non-animated addition to this genre. Based very loosely of the original Mickey Mouse short in Fantasia, this movie is driven primarily by the good dialogue, witty comedy, and low-key but effective special effects. The action scenes are many, but short. The story itself is somewhat predictable with two overlapping romances, a rivalry, an evil witch, and a lurking army of the dead that needs to be kept dead. The sum of the parts is what was to be expected in the summer of 2010; a big-name movie filled with big name stars and worth the two hours of escapism."
2,Fatuous Apprentice,"The promos were great. The scene where the Merlinean Ring wraps itself around the ""chosen"" one's finger is what made me buy the DVD. And it seems that was the only good scene in the movie. Nicholas Cage looked jaded almost bored. The director was unsure if he had set out to make a movie for kids or for the baby boomers, a comedy or an adventure. Why does the Prime Merlinean, who is supposed to save the world from the vicious Morgana, act and look like a bird brain? In movies where it is about saving the world, the hero can not be a fatuous bum. I have recently watched a few such disasters, which suffered from this very problem (read my review on The Green Lantern and R.A One). Barring one or two scenes, this movie left me cold. Looking at the price tag on the DVD, I'd rate this movie as highly-avoidable."
2,"Dresden, is that you?","It's not you? Well, someone ""borrowed"" your hat, trench coat, attitude and there was even a mention of Bob. Magic seemed to work a little differently though. The only thing that really makes this movie tolerable is watching for other similarities."
1,Hate Science,"Young people who watch Disney movies are exposed to two things:First, stereotypes, inane scripts, poor acting, cheap graphics and redundant rehashed storylines.Second, any dream of pursuing an interest in technical, scientific or mathematical subjects are quashed by the ugly, inept stereotypes of people associated with those fields."
5,Great for travel,"These compressors really do work and are very convenient for travel. They can be used to store clean or dirty clothes easily. The trick is to fold the items flat when placing them in the bags (without overstuffing them), which will allow the bags to close properly and stay flat. Once compressed, they leaves a lot of room for other items in the suitcase making them quite necessary for travel when space is limited."
3,compression bags,"The large was way smaller than I had expected. I wanted to put a huge wool blanket in it, but it wont fit. Be sure to read the dimensions."
5,Fantastic. Best brand.,"I bought three different brands of Compression Bags and these are definitely my favorite. I didn't believe a queen size comforter would fit in the large bag, but it did! I was very impressed. It got so small and took no room in our suitcase. Amazing. I found that this brand kept the air out, whereas the others didn't as much. Also, the yellow plastic zip closure was more solid than on other brands and would actually close the bag tightly together, whereas others wouldn't (with the other brands, I would have to use my fingers to get the zip closure to close). I would definitely buy this brand again if I need more bags."
2,travel compressor bags,Difficult to use. I was not satisfied with its performance; I ended up not using them.
5,Great for traveling with winter coats!,I am using this product to compress our winter coats so we can have more room in our bags. I tried this out last night and it works like a charm! I now have lots more space to work with in my suitcase! I first saw this in a travel magazine for a much higher price so I'm glad I was able to find it here for cheaper! Thanks for a great product & a great deal!
5,Best packing compression bags on the market,"I've used all the compression bags on the market (including Space Bags) and for packing, this brand is by far the best performing and durable. I use them for motorcycle trips and long business trips (so I need only a carry-on). Keep in mind ""compression"" equals wrinkling if the clothing items are not knit. These bags are also great for your dirty laundry,takes up much less space and wrinkling doesn't matter. Don't use them for packing underwire bras, the rolling of the bag during compression will damage them."
1,A glorified Ziploc bag,"I am completely baffled by all the positive reviews for this product. I bought these compression sacs because of the positive reviews as well as positive experiences I've had with Eagle Creek products in the past (their luggage, in particular). However, these bags are truly worthless. They are like big Ziploc bags made with slightly thicker plastic. As I was testing one out, eager to find out how well it would compress some clothes for an upcoming trip, the yellow slider thing that closes the bag at the top popped off. I thought, ""Perhaps I overpacked it,"" so I took some clothes out and tried again. But the slider kept popping off. For $18 this should have worked A LOT better. I don't know, maybe I just don't have the magic touch that the other reviewers have. If so, please show me the error in my ways and I will try again, because it is too late for me to get my money back :-("
5,Great for travel,My husband travels a lot and tries to keep everything to one small carry-on. These bags are durable and have been very functional in compressing items to keep them small and packable. I am thinking of buying another set for myself!
1,Esto es rock en espanol???,Esto parece mas musica de comunismo... esto no vale 99 cents esto debe valer 49 cents
1,Bad language software,"This cdrom was the worst investment i have ever made. it was not organized for a beginner. there were no chapters, or any way to find out where to start. it made you repeat a bunch of phrases and sentences, so you had no idea what you were saying, unless you chose to see the translation, but it did not teach you the basics. it is rubbish!!!!!! do not buy it!"
2,Props for talent,"Set in the same setting as A Separate Peace, Peace Breaks Out takes place a few years after WWI. It's apparent that John Knowles hasn't lost his style and knack for writing. His artistic language is almost enough just to read the story alone... almost.The characters in Peace Breaks Out are not as complicated and real as in A Separate Peace and one can't help but compare plot to A Separate Peace. This is an okay book. Great writing, so-so plot."
2,Peace Breaks Out,"Pete Hallam, former Devon student, goes back to his old school after fighting in the war, as a young master. The students are restless, not being able to fight for their country, but are good boys. One of them, however, is a troublemaker; a talented but underhanded fellow. He shares a mutual hatred with one of the other students - an obnoxious German. What happens at Devon this year is the subject of this book. I did not particularly enjoy the read as this novel lacked plot, but it did teach a good lesson."
3,Definately Not a Separate Peace,"Going in, I knew this book had to be different than Separate Peace, it of course can not be a clone of it. But to be blunt, it wasn't as good as a separate peace. the plot was simple, like a separate peace, but that book had a much more emotional impact on me. i halfwished the story was about Gene and what he did after he left Devon. There were two small references to Phineas, that I enjoyed. It's a decent read and we get to visit Devon one more time."
5,How can you not love this book?,"Granted, reading this book was required in my 10th grade English class, but there's no way I would call reading it a waste of time as many assigned books are. This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's an allegory that explores the human spirit in a way few books do. It's funny, sad, touching, terrible. What more could you ask for?"
3,Pretty good for the price,"This wheel seems to be quite good for the price, it needed ""trued"" after delivery, but according to the bike shop that's fairly common. I'm not sure this wheel would handle much off-roading but we don't have to worry about that these days."
3,Rather good book,This book is rather good. Many of the articles are quite good but other are too old-fashioned and out of date. But because of those good articles I would recommend the book to anyone.
3,"Need to know vs, Nice to know","Having recently moved into the KM area I thought this book would be a 'must read'....but as anither reviewer pointed out if you have been keeping in touch with KM from the beginning (or whatever , from '96) would not find anything earth-shattering (that's the tacit selling job of the HBR logo, right?) in the compilation.We all have heard about Drucker's ""knowledge workers"" and Nonaka's ""Creation of Knowledge"" and Argyris and his ""teaching smart people"" and Dorothy Leonard's ""whole organisation brain"" theory ad nauseum ad infinitum!Guess HBR should have added more value (or retros or something ) instead of just taking photcopies of their old articles and printing them together!"
3,Harvard Business Review on Knowledge Management (Harvard Business Review Paperback Series),Ok but we found the complete idiot's guide on Knowledge Management to be a bit more useful for our needs.
4,English for Russian Speakers: Pimsleur Basic Cours,"I've tried several of the audio courses, and this was the best one by far. It has the clearest audio, and enough repetition in different situations to allow you to learn the vocabulary well. You learn enough to be able to actually construct new sentences from the words you learn, not just memorize and repeat sounds. I was complimented on my pronunciation several times while in Russia.My only complaint would be the same as above, there was so much repetition that it did not cover very much ground in the whole course. I felt it could have moved a little faster than it did. But the other course I tried had no repetition or explanation at all."
5,thoughful music you've probably never heard before,"i am usually adverse to buying compilation CD's; now this one has made me hungry for more naxos issues of work by these composers.while i enjoyed all the compositions, the string quartet by alfred janson was most striking- the shimmering simplicity and vast silences worked beautifully."
3,Get down tonight:Best of Disco (various artists),"Sadly, most tracks feature only in their edited 7"" versions. However Sister Sledge ""He's the greatest dancer"" and Tower of Power ""What is hip"" both appear as full length extended club mixes."
5,BUY THIS NOW!,"Battle Axe Records have some of the best underground hip-hop acts around. This is a mix of the best songs ever released by Battle axe. There isnt a bad song on the CD, but Red Dragon, stop bitin, smokin in here, and death appeal are my favorites. Buy/Burn this CD and then buy/Burn all the CDs of the acts u like most."
2,BUC FIFTY... is worth the money,"Honestly this CD sucks!!! The only reason why you should spend money on it is to hear BUC FIFTY kill it. I myself just got it for the track Bangin, because Alchemist is on the beat and Buc drops some cool lines. If ya want the best of BUC go cop his Serve the Devil, Praise the Lord...It is his best LP to date. Peace"
3,Not as good as first!!!,"This album has more of a mainstream sound, almost sounds as if the Swollen Memebers are starting to go for a more mainstream fanbase. However, it is still a good album, not as good as the first compilation, but better than the stuff they play on MTV...."
2,Re-releases and B sides???,"I dont know why but battleaxe records has a thing for releasing the same tracks on many cds. I own the code name scorpion cd and a few songs are on here. STOP BITING IS ON CODE NAME SCORPION, AB RUDES CD AND BATTLEAXE 2. I know this is a compilation of battleaxe's best but cmon how bad do you have to milk the same stuff. Don't get me wrong Battleaxe is dope and the members are the phatest thing to come outta the west coast but battleaxe warriors 2 pales in comparison to its original. Its an alright cd to chill to but it dries out fast. I dunno maybe its just me cause i own every release from battleaxe but im just not feelin this one. PEACE!"
1,Don't Bother Buying this,"I recently upgraded to a Stiletto 2 which was very nice, but as usual, it won't fit in this boombox or my home and auto docking station because they wqere for the narrower Stiletto 1. I had to return the Stiletto 2 and stay with my older, or buy all new which I wasn't about to do. You would think Sirius would come out with an adapter.They would sell more Stiletto 2's that way"
3,Pokemon - Red Version,"It plays well but does not save. When you turn it off, you have to start all over again when you play it again. Any ideas? I gave this to my grandson for Christmas and he is very disappointed."
5,Love it!,Ah Classic. bought this while back just adding the review now and im still playing it. Mwhaha delightfully fun to play
3,Another Pokemon Review by me..,This game was a good start for the Pokemon franchise but to strictly say. Very straight forward game and not very difficult. In my opinon this is the kinda game you would play in your free time or for old times sake. The controls are identical to Blue and Yellow and gameplay is simple.
3,Great game needs and has improved,"This game is great! The problem is it needs more adventure. Sure it has the intese moments when you first start. I have had it not even a year and have beaten it 16 times! I am so glad that Nintendo has come out with new versions. If you are first starting this is good to start out with then get into gold, silver, crystal, ruby, and saphire versions. Those are not in order. Please do not rely me me only even though you probably wouldn't dream of it. I myself have the red version and that only."
4,Can't beat the original,"For us old pokemon fans, we fell in love with red and blue. I personally was a charzard fan in third grade, and this happened to be my first rpg. Everyone seemed to have some version of pokemon. You could even trade them with other people, providing you had the correct linking device. After pokemon fell out of fashion, no one seemed to want those really new games (except for the new third graders of course). The original set of pokemon were the greatest, even the strange ones like jynx. I hated the pokemon show after about a year of watching it everyday and owning all the pokemon merchandise. But I still buy the games and play them, because you can't beat the game play. It's quite simply amazing.I'm sad to say my red version was stolen from me a few years ago, but I hope to purchase it once again at a used video game store.Don't be expecting good graphics. This game has terrible graphics but it's still a wonderful game. Many old rpgs are :]"
3,this is too addictive!,"when i first got this game, i was addicted to it. but that was about a year ago. after playing with it for about a year i started to realize what a bad game it was. it is slow, and there is no excitement."
2,This game sucks,I'm bored so i'm writing a review for this horrible game. The tv series is bad enough so why the hell would they make a game just as bad? the graphics really sucks and so does the sound... DEATH TO ALL POKEMON!!!!
3,A game that doesn`t have all the Pokemon...,"This game really has a whole lot of Pokemon, but the Crystal version I have has more Pokemon. Compared to the Red, Blue and Yellow Versions to the Gold, Silver, and Crystal Versions, Red, Blue and Yellow versions, it has 150 pokemon while the Gold, Silver, and Crystal version has 250 pokemon. The Ruby and Sapphire Versions have 200 pokemon. So the Gold, Silver, and Crystal has more than Red, Blue, Yellow, Ruby, and Sapphire, even though Ruby and Sapphire replaced old pokemon and removed them for new pokemon."
5,One of the best games ever...,"i played this game as a kid, and i just recently decided to buy it again.. and im glad i did.. i havent it played this in forever and it was really fun! ha and yeah, the graphics and sound arent great. but what do you expect, its from the 90s! still very fun, and my favorite. i am glad i got it."
4,This is the best game,"I first thought pokemon was uncool untill i traded for this game. I played it first starting with charmander and got stuck and could do nothing and got bored and didn't play it for a year or so. When I picked it up again. I haven't put it down. I have beat the elite four and have 67 pokemon. I am still interested. I have taken this on many long trips. Its good for that but in the car it might make you car sick. I think this game is the only pokemon thing you need. The toys are pointless. The cards are just peices of paper, and the tv show and movie is dull. Get this game(start with bulbasur)"
4,pokemon is a pretty fun game to play,pokemon is fun when you begin but soon it gets to easy and it's not that fun. But I have to admit pokemon is a good game.
5,Pokemon:The best selling title for Gameboy,"When you think about one of the most best selling games for gameboy,pokemon should pop up in your head.Thats because pokemon is a good RPG and fun for reasons.This is a good example to get a link cable (to trade!).And you can go anywhere,anyplace as long as you train pokemon.throughout the game,team rocket is using pokemon as money.To continue on,you have to ruin their plan and continue on.Pokemon was first released in 1995 as Pocket Monsters Red/Green.The graphics weren't good and the game was released as pocket monsters blue.North America got the graphics from pocket monsters blue.But the main goal in this game is to be the master and catch em all!"
4,Old School,"I purchased this game for my daughter who still had found her gameboy from 1999. She really wanted the red version again, so I purchased it. She said it was as fun as she remembers! The game itself was in excellent condition."
5,"Charizard, I Choose You","The red version is my favorite game. I like this product because the game can be fun and because of the MissingNo. trick and because you can catch a lot of cool and powerful pokemon. I started out with a Charmander and boy does it rock! Its like the powerfulest one in the game. It gets a little hard sometimes when you are battling a gym leader but you know you can defeat him/her. Pokemon red is the hottest one I ever played. My pokemon are Mewtwo, Gengar, MissingNo., Golbat, Pidgeot, and I forgot the other one. There all at level 255 from the MissingNo. trick. Apperently, MissingNo. doesn't actually mess up your game. It only messes up the pokemon league hall of fame. Or it can sometimes mess up your graphics when you are using it.Tip: Have strong and a variety types of pokemon.I sugest eeryone should get pokemon red. It's fun and the money is worth it!"
1,Bad,The game is highly repetitive and is an imitation of Gameboy Zelda. It is not worth the time to play and the money wasted on batteries.
1,Pokemoron :(,"Here is the number one sleeping pill in the world. If you have trouble sleeping play this game (not that it should be considered a game, games are supposed to be fun). It was boring boring boring. The graphics were horrible the plot was stupid. You can't catch them all unless you waste money on buying blue, yellow, and red. They have now come out with gold, silver, and cyrstal so you can try to catch more creatures. The game was so easy that I was able to beat it even though I am a novice. The piont is to beat the tar out of stupid nonexistent monsters to train and battle them so you can become number one so other trainers can try and beat up your pokemon. I think this game is a waste and anyone who buys it is going to ultimatly come to the same conclusion as I have. Don't waste your money as the craze will die down soon."
1,A good game- if you still like pokemon.,"I'll admit, probobly 2 years ago I'd be giving this game 5 stars because it was fun. It was the first gameboy game I got, it was challenging(at first), and I always had fun. I used to be a hordcore fan of Poke'mon. But lets face the facts, THAT WAS 2 YEARS AGO. People who like Poke'mon today are living in the past. I do not like Poke'mon anymore. As a matter of fact I recently sold this game and all the other Poke'mon stuff I had like cards and other games. Poke'mon was once the hottest thing around. But after they made that movie, Poke'mon went down. This game is challenging, it took me two and a half months to beat it then slowly it started to get boring. So if you like Poke'mon get it but if you want to live in today's world don't buy it."
3,An amazing game but.....,The sticker on the front is faded and partly scratched off. I guess it is used but I should get it for less money for that.
4,Thanks,"Good game, I've never played any of the Poke'mon games before but have always wanted to. I just need to find the time to play this more now."
4,good game,Was a good game when I was go younger and still was a pretty good game when I played it ...everything worked great withe one I just boughr
5,This game is very fun.,"I forgot how much fun this game was, reminds me of when i was younger. Now i have to go buy blue so i can trade haha"
3,Red Pokemon,"Daughter is very happy with purchase. Has used for some time now with no technical issues or any other problems. Very fair price and positive experience, arrived very quickly."
5,Pokemon Red: A Must-Have for Pokemon Stadium and Your GB(A),"Pokemon Stadium is the most addictive Game Boy game I've ever seen. You can catch Pokemon, care for them by taking them to the Pokemon Center, Explore the wild and catch pokemon, participate in Gym matches to get badges, and LOTS more!Pros:- Compatible with the Nintendo 64 game, Pokemon Stadium (Nintendo 64 TRANSFER PAK REQUIRED (sold seperately)! )- Explore the world of Pokemon- Participate in Battles to strenghten your Pokemon- VERY addictive- GREAT graphics (for its time, of course)Cons:- If you HATE Pokemon, I don't recommend this game to you- Doesn't contain ALL 151 Pokemon (You need Pokemon Blue (SOLD SEPERATELY!)+ this game to get all 151 Pokemon)Overall:If you like pokemon, want an addictive video game for your Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and/or Game Boy Advance SP, or just looking for an adventure game GET THIS GAME TODAY!"
4,"Its good, but Blue is better","This game is a awesome game. You play Ash Ketchum, a young PKMN trainer who always trys to beat his opponent. This is fun till you catch all 150 PKMN. Also, if you dont have either, get blue instead."
4,"Red and Blue are easy to master, but it contains errors.","This type of RPG was easy to master, because at the start of the game, I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match. I used him in the first 2 stages of the game, but sometimes the rest of the game. Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type, it will either say ""It's super effective"" or ""It's not very effective"" Otherwise, this game's a blast to play, with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from. Go buy them both. You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver."
4,A chance to hear some rare music,"This compact disk has a fine selection of Haydn's music for solo keyboard, music that is not terribly well known. As this year is the 200th anniversary of this great composer's death, it is especially helpful to be able to hear this music, to listen to these fine examples of keyboard variations. They are very well played. As a pianist, I was looking for a particular piece, as I was interested in the performer's interpretation of the articulation, phrasing, and dynamics. The recording is very clear, and the playing is accurate and reliable. I recommend the recording to those who would like to learn about Haydn's style and about his unusual skill in writing variations."
1,Came damaged,I don't rec this company. Product was damaged (one of the songs/area was scratched and it just kept repeating. Took a long time to get a refund.
3,6576453,George Sansom gives too much of a bias view against the Tokugawa's and how they served their country. I would wish to find a book on the history of Japan between 1600-1800 that would give an accurate unbiased view.
1,NOT BLACKCURRANTS,"We order these thinking theyre black currants since that's what they're called. They are NOT black currants, they are zante currants which are raisins."
1,mis advertized lying,"BEWARE!! these are NOT currants -- NOT EVEN CLOSE.... read the fine print they are raisins, plain and simple. fine print says they are made from GRAPES not CURRANTS."
1,Fine IF You're Looking for Tiny Raisins,"I would not object if these had been labeled simply ""currants"" because Zante grapes are called currants in this country (the U.S.). However, Bob's Red Mill has unfortunately chosen to label these ""black currants"" which generally means Ribes nigrum. Luckily, I read the fine print at the last minute. Zante raisins (Vitis vinifera) are fine as raisins go, but they are not the antioxidant powerhouses that real currants are, and they do not have the complex flavor that the rest of the world associates with black currants. Bob's Red Mill ""black currants"" are probably better than most Zante raisins, but the label is misleading and it misrepresents the product. Bad call, Bob. I expect better from you."
2,"Health benefits are those of grapes, not black currants","If you're looking, as I was, for the type of black currants that researchers have found are higher in antioxidants than grapes and may have powerful health benefits, look elsewhere. It's not so much that the manufacturer is being dishonest as that ""black currant"" has come to mean ""Zante currant"" in the U.S. What researchers studied was the Ribes nigrum species; the common name ""black currant"" here is just going to mislead you into buying small raisins. Ribes nigrum is a berry that grows on bushes, while grapes are unrelated and grow on vines.After buying these and finding they tasted a lot like raisins (I should have read the earlier reviews), I did some research in Wikipedia and on the web and finally found a source of real black currants, which I've just ordered. Amazon has some products that list Ribes nigrum as an ingredient, but doesn't seem to carry the berries, just seed oil, cosmetics, and powders."
4,"Good currants, though don't taste different than box in store","I love black currants- the kind that are mostly in European products. I decided to give these a try, and found them to be like the boxed Zante currants in the store... there's nothing wrong with those, but they are more like tiny raisins (as are these). I'll use them, but am still looking for the true black currant taste that I love in the European black currant products."
3,La Dosis is the new Mexican pop-alternative band,"La Dosis' first album was a big hit as they debuted with many hits but this second album ""Hydro"" fell below my expectations."
2,Simple book but verbose - no cdrom - for real beginners only,"This rather verbose book extensively covers basic commands of autocad which are also covered in many other cad books (and autocad tutorials). It could be as well used as a text book to cover engineering design, being too generic (learning polylines starting page 433, layers page 500, blocks page 761, ...) without really touching the art of drawing plans in 2D/3D (no 3D in fact - no shading, rendering, etc...). It is helpful for real beginners only.It does not come with cdrom although it says so and the online companion is not even on the web site of the publisher as of May 15, 2002."
5,"On time, on budget","The watch speaks for itself, Citizen makes good watches. The price was very good and it was delivered as promised."
3,A Black Hole,"Although it's convenient to carry, you have to take it off to get things out. Also, it's got this one big compartment in the middle and it's really difficult to find anything. I only used it as a diaper bag for a couple weeks before purchasing something else. I did use it as a backpack/purse when I went to Disneyland (without my daughter - bad mommy!) and it worked pretty well for that, I guess."
4,"Acceptable sound, strong performance","My disc was not defective. But while ""Little Pixie"" played fine, it does fade out before the end, so the band never reaches its full climax. Oh, well. Still an important document."
5,Los mejores Remixes!,"En este CD estan los mejores remixes de Grupo Mania. ""Radio Mix"" y ""Merengue Mix"" del tema ""Como Baila"" estan perfectamente elaborados. Un verdaero MIX!"
3,Looking for information...,"This book was recommended to me when I was considering homeschooling my child with Asperger's.The stories were interesting but it wasn't the type of book I needed at the time. If you are looking for a narrative or testimonial and some general info it is ok but if you are looking for specific information about curriculum, techniques or programs this book isn't particularly helpful."
3,Is not PSP Slim 2000,"Hi,The material is good, but cover too much the PSP. I can't play some games. My PSP is slim 2000."
4,New PDA Standard: 16 MB RAM,"I recently sold my Palm VIIx (8 MB RAM), which served me well. I'm an undergraduate, and 16 MB is a must for new PDA photo albums, applications, and (of course) games.I have owned the S360 for a few weeks now, and its slim design and protective cover make it very fashionable and sturdy. The only drawback with the S360 is Sony's inablity to include a CRADLE. The S360 comes with separate USB cradle and recharge adapter cables. I cannot simultaneously recharge and sync the S360."
4,Like the unit hate the power switch,"Sony put out a nice unit just forgot to include a cradle and gave us a cheap hotsync cord instead. The power switch is not the best but if that's all that I can find wrong with this unit then it must be worth the money... Even running e-book applications and vindigo, the battery life indicator just has not moved in 3 days. Awesome. This may be a great choice but if you want a bright screen consider the compaq's or the new units from Audiovox. Otherwise this is a winner."
4,First impression: it rocks,"I just got this PDA a couple of hours ago, and it's my first. It took me only about 20 minutes to learn all the essentials, including the graffiti alphabet. It's very fast and efficient as well; must be all the memory. So far it looks like a real winner."
4,Sony side up,"I bought the Sony Clie PEG T615C (color display) because my Palm m100 was failing -- I suspect because of several intense bombardments by airport security X-ray beams. The display on the Clie is much crisper (320 pixels/inch instead of 160) and the screen contrast much better. I like the idea of a rechargeable battery because the Palm would go into convulsions without warning whenever the battery went low, which is unnerving (no pun intended) when you're traveling. The slim design (0.5 inch thick rather than 0.9) is also better.Only two negatives so far; a flimsy non-protective front flap, and no instructions for downloading databases from Palm; it nearly takes a Ph.D. in nuclear physics, which fortunately I have. Even then, I had to reassign the categories to each entry in the address book."
3,The Sony Peg-S360,"This handheld is good for someone starting in the electronic word. Being the cheapest of the Sony handhelds, this Palm operated PDA keeps you organized and reminds you to do things. though while this is all it does, unless your into a handheld arcade, its still pretty practical."
5,Best PDA Yet,"I have owned 4 Palm PDA's but have now switched to the Sony Clie PEG-S360. Best move I ever made!!! This is truly the best PDA I have ever owned. The screen is incredibly clear, 16 meg memory, jog dial, size and weight are awesome, upgradeable with the memory stick, I could go on and on. For the [price] range, this one is the best!"
1,Don't Buy A Sony,"Crashed withing 3 months. Customer service incompetent, but I suppose I have to deal with them to get this fixed under warranty. They are sloppy and ill-informed. Never had a SONY handheld before, and certainly won't buy one again."
1,dissapointed,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. She used it for three months and then it just would not turn on. She called Sony and they had her ship it back to them. She waited another two months and then called them about the status of the repair. They sent the handheld back and it's in the same condition as before. It will not turn on. She called Sony again and several people talked her through the reset but it still won't turn on.We're very frustrated and don't really want to send it back for repair again if this is going to be the result. We'd like to speak to the person that thinks they repaired it the first time or we'd like a new piece of equipment.Anyway I'm not getting any satisfaction from Sony so I thought I'd try this.
2,Loved it while it still worked,"I had a great first few weeks with my Clie. Lot's of memory, good screen, handy controls, good bundled software.But last week it didn't turn on. I've tried all the normal tricks without success. The Sony support site was not very helpful (""Try a soft reset.""). And Sony tech support hasn't responded to my messages....Statistically speaking, yours probably won't break. If it works, you'll love it."
3,a good pda but service stinks,"The pda worked fine, in fact, as perfect as it comes for the basic operations. The memory stick is great, especially if you have other Sony equipment that uses it. However, after two months of use it all of a suddent went dead. The usual tricks like resetting, etc. failed to revive it, and Sony technician had me send it for service, express mail and all paid by the warranty. 10 days later, they are still ""working on it"", and the web page says that they can hold it for 15 working days, i.e. 21 days! Imagine being without your phone book and pocket calendar for 3 weeks! This is totally unacceptable. I wonder if other manufacturers are any better. The only soluiton I can imagine is the ""Jaguar"" method: buy two. Not very funny, is it?"
1,Maybe Would Have Liked It If The Power Turned ON,"Mine arrived as scheduled, but the power would not turn on. I had it charged for over 8 hours, and I felt the Clie get warm (so the battery was charging). After letting it charge, it would not power on. I did soft and hard resets and called Sony Tech Support. It was good support 24/7, but the tech said that he'd ""run across the problem before."" - Seemed like he was understating the number of times this happened. My advice is that this is a great product, but I'm going to buy it at a local retailer to make sure this won't happen again. I read on cnet.com another person had the same problem with both of the S360's he bought."
3,"Overall good, power button broke after 1 month","This item is great. The least expensive 16MB model with a 33MHz processor. Everything works really well on this model, except the power button. I noticied it was flimsy when it was brand new, and it just stopped working after 1 month of use.A cradle would also be nice, but at this price, I understand why they left it out. If you need the extra memory, this is a good model, but I need to send mine back now to get the power button fixed."
2,Low priced = low quality,"I bought this from Best Buy on sale, and it died after 1 month of light usage. Recharging the battery does not solve the problem as the unit does not power on. I had Handspring Visor, Palm Professional and they all worked without problems in the past for over one year. I will be looking at the Tungsten T from Palm, no more Sony toys. Sony may make good consumer electronics, but they should stay away from computing products."
2,"Beware many of the other reviews, written by company...","It's hard to imagine a more transparent attempt to inflate the user ratings for these products. Over half of the five-star rated reviews are copy-paste identical. Not coincidentally, there is one such review for each language product they make. I'm glad Amazon is bunching them together so you can see this clearly. Beware!A friend lent me the French version and it's mediocre and unstructured."
1,Sorry I Ever Wasted My Money On This @%$#,"I bought this title back in August when the reviews seemed overwhelmingly good. But it is obvious now that someone connected with this company was trying to boost the rating with false commentaries. This is truly the worst piece of software I have ever used. There is no rhyme or reason to the GUI, even the sound of the French speakers is muddled. I have the Rosetta Stone French Explorer that my husband and I enjoy using.We were surprised when we actually started the learn the language. But rather than spend the extra money for the Rosetta Stone complete software program I fell for this drivel. As my husband says, quite often you really do get what you pay for. This lousey piece of &^$# is heading for the Goodwill Store."
1,Waste of time and money,"My Mother bought this, but was not able to make any use of it. After having installed the software myself, I would have to agree; it is a waste of time and money. Stay away."
1,If you have a new Mac do not buy this software,None of the two disks cn be down loaded to Mac 10. Also the customer service is not available in non working hours.
2,Sorry but this is not really good reading,I think this author is an amateur. The attempts at humor are incredibly silly and NOT funny. The so called mystery is not a mystery at all. Sorry but I could not wait for this to end. The novel just seemed incredibly amateurish and the writing was very cliched.
4,Brahms Symphonies by Haitink and the LSO,"I would not choose this as my first option for the Brahms symphonies because the sound quality in these live performances is not the best, especially considering they are relatively recent recordings (2004). The Haitink set with the Concertgebouw Orchestra on Philips are clearer. But I would put the Solti recordings with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on Decca in first place with Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia on Philips second for clarity of sound and the tempi chosen. One advantage of the Haitink/LSO set is that there is a performance of the rarely heard double concerto for violin and cello included in the set, together with the 2nd Serenade, which is well worth repeated listening.Brahms: The Symphonies"
3,Easy Interesting Read,"I think Morgan mellowed a bit on this one. Although an interesting commentary of the integration of peoples, it lacks some of the spark and fire of many of her other novels. It is a good book if you want something that can be read quickly. I must agree with others the alternating chapters for the characters sometimes is a bit unnerving when trying to follow the story line."
5,Strongbow,"Despite the negative reviews about the alternate chapter writing, I belive it was a well written book and the chapters were very easy for me to follow. If I, a junior high school student, can foolow this story i would think that just about anny literate person should find it enjoyable and inspiring. The story plot is set in Ireland/England in the 12th century. Richard de Clare, AKA Strongbow, is the son of a very popular warrior. Aoife, AKA Red Eva, is the daughter of a very important leader. I would recomend this book to anyone that enjoyed Brian Boru or who has an Irish Background."
1,"Bad ""History""","There was very little new in this book that was not in More's original (which was never meant for publication nor finished). Her book draws all of its conclusions from More and disregards any points contrary to her thesis. How she chose to determine which dialoge of More's, he himself admited he made up much of it, was real and fiction is beyond me. The jumps in logic she makes astounded me. For instance, there is one part where she says that More stated something as fact and it must be true because there were rumors to that effect. Is it not more likely that More was reporting rumors? To base the work on More and pick and chose the parts of other sources that fit her theory is is amazing. I have read 3 other Weir books before this one, now I wish I had been more critical. As others have said before read Kendall, try Walpole too (for early revisionist theories). If you read Kendall, More, Ross, you will probably be able to write a better, more honest book than Weir did."
4,Great historical read,"The Princes in the Tower offers a clear and engaging look at the often confusing War of the Roses. Politics and power plays are interwoven with the narration of the Princes' fate. Weir does an excellent job of trying to solve the mystery of their disappearence using circumstancial evidence and historical accounts.This is not an historical tome, but a painless and well-researched view of one of history's most famous murder mysteries."
4,Interesting and Classic Weir,"If you don't know anything about Richard III and the kids in the Tower, this is a nice, entertaining orientation (even if others argue that it's inaccurate) that is an extremely quick read (particularly compared to Weir's ""Wars of the Roses,"" the reading time of which may be measured in ice ages). I cannot judge the accuracy or inaccuracy of her arguments or evidence because this is the first book I read. That said, I very much liked the book, was glad I read it, and am more motivated to read other books on the subject (ones they may be more pro-Richard even)."
3,Good story,"The mysterious and brutal deaths of the boy king Edward V and his younger brother Richard, Duke of York, still brings fascination despite five centuries into the details of what happened to the Princes in the Tower. English historian Alison Weir reconstructs the entire chain of events leading to the double murder, examining contemporary evidence as well as dozens of modern accounts. This is an interesting piece of historical research and a riveting story of conspiracy and deception in which the author provides her own theory in answering the centuries-old question: did Richard III really kill the Princes, his nephews, to secure his claim to the throne of England or was the murderer someone else entirely? Is she right? I haven't a clue. Yet she does do a good job of telling the story and laying out the case for her own theory. It's worth a read."
4,Well written and entertaining theory,"Alison Weir writes a lot of winners on the subject of English history, but once in a while she hits a sour note. This isn't one of those, but it isn't among her finest efforts---not because of her research and writing skills; those are top notch. Rather, it's that the very case of the murdered princes is one of such flimsy speculation that all Ms. Weir can offer is educated theories and her personal hypotheses. Knowing that going in, I still enjoyed her vivid and detailed accounting of the notorious double-murder and subsequent intrigue in the royal circles.Genre fans will certainly want to include this in their libraries."
2,Unbalanced to the max,"I have not yet formed an opinion concerning whether or not Richard III was responsible for the Princes' deaths. I looked to this book for a balanced view, as advertised and reviewed. I was shocked at the partisan nature of the arguments. I am a lawyer and the book was in most respects an advocate's brief--not an informative, ""both sides presented"" book. I have no objection to the author's espousing the ""Richard's guilty"" viewpoint, just to the way in which the book is marketed as a non-partisan examination of the evidence."
1,Read a real history book,"Weir is notorious for writing more fable than fact. Try reading Paul Murray Kendall's Richard the III for an extremely well written, well researched and truly thought provoking history of who RIII was. This book is very well footnoted and uses sources from during Richard's life along with the writings of the Tudor historians. And believe it or not, it is extremely readable and hard to put down.Thomas More's Richard the III, written for Henry the VII, is completely based on hearsay (More was a child during Richard's life). Unfortunately, it was unchallenged until Walpole's Historic Doubts in the late 1800's (Walpole had his own problems, though)If you want good historical fiction that attempts to portray who Richard was, check out Sharon Kay Penman's The Sunne in Splendour. It is an excellent read even if the ending may or may not be historically accurate.BTW, Shakespeare wasn't writing history, he was catering to the Tudor regime."
1,Fiction attempting to pass for serious history,"This book has a bibliography but no footnotes or source citations. If you are a serious history student, don't waste your time on this book. It isn't worth the paper it's written on."
3,Entertaining reading but sloppy scholarship,"Though this work provides an entertaining and thrilling story of Richard III and the Princes, Ms. Weir has a lot to answer for. Although the author's preface states that she has dealt with the subject ""from an objective viewpoint based on common sense and sound research,"" it is clear from the first sentence that her viewpoint is biased in the extreme. The book, saturated with contradictions, uncited quotations, and blatant unproven assumptions, should not be used by students as a scholarly reference work, but only for amusement, and with the knowledge that it is a piece of sensationalist fiction. The primary sources for information about the reign of Richard III were written by people who lived under the kingships of the Tudors; as we must be skeptical of their statements and biases, so must we look askance at this masterpiece, written by a woman who clearly likes her roses red."
5,A Great Book!,"Outstanding historical review! Alison Weir truly left no stone unturned in researching this book. The text itself is full of many direct historical references. Her chronology of the whole event is the most logical and her conclutions the most plausable I've seen on the subject. Her attention to each detail of the account makes the book compelling but it is not a light read! The case she put together against Richard III is quite damning! If I go to court, I want her on my side! This was the first Alison Weir book I have read - I'm on the look out for more of her titles!"
4,Not as persuasive as Weir thinks,"I read Alison Weir's book after reading Penman's the Sunne in Splendor. While I found it informative and highly readable, I felt that she had ignored other plausible scenarios and relied unduly on More. For example, she dismisses Buckingham as the murderer with little analysis except that he could not have gotten past Richard's gatekeeper at the tower, a proposition inconsistent with Buckingham's key role at that time. She also ignores the fact that, if Richard killed the princes, it was the worst possible timing. She states that he killed them to prevent a rebellion, but that is exactly what occurred upon their death and Richard must have known, as Weir later concludes, that ""the princes posed a greater thret in life than death."" In sum, I enjoyed the read, but didn't agree with Weir there is ""only one plausible solution"" to the mystery."""
2,Not her best work,"I've read a bunch of Weir's other works and I've liked them all, but after having read this I began doubting her other works. Having read nearly a dozen accounts of Richard III's life and his relationship to the princes, I can say that this is more or less a rehashing of Sir Thomas More's UNFINISHED biography of RIII. Her whole case rests on the work of More, whose work has been questioned, most notbably and effectively by Horace Walpole.Weir questions her own sources and then uses them to prove her point the ""Richard did it"". An earthshattering conclusion? Not by any means, but the way she gets there is somewhat lazy and ignores some pretty decent scholarship on the subject. Most of what we ""know"" about RIII comes from Shakespeare's play, which is based on More. Weir didn't seem to stray any further than Shakespeare (the Oliver Stone of the Elizabethian age) to come to her conclusion.Again, not her best work. She does a much better job with the Tudors."
3,"Interesting, but too much speculation","For a young interested student like me, the way Weir has structured this book made the reading flow well and she keeps her mind focussed on what she is trying to prove. However, her information was too circumstantial to be taken seriously. If anything, this is a good introduction to royal history and the political intrigue that accompanied it."
4,Excellent Book,Alison Weir is one of my favorite authors for the details of the time period and nuances of each book. This book was an excellent book and I highly recommend it.
2,Very badly done!,"I agree completely with David above. It is shameful to me that this book is considered a biography. And as to an objective and unbiased account of the subject, this is laughable. You'd be better off reading a more scholarly book on this subject."
1,This should be considered a decent work of fiction,"This is a great book for those people who believe that anything published in a book must be true. For the rest of you, it should be good for some laughs. Weir is a master of creative logic, repeatedly using conflicting pieces of information to support her hypothesis as she runs through the entire list of logic no-no's and fallacious reasoning. Poor Richard must be rolling in his grave. The only surprise here is that she does not blame him for the holocaust and the crash of '29. What a farce!"
5,A Customer SHUT UPP!!!!! YOU WRETCHED BEAST!!!!,I love this book. A Customer shut up!!!! YOU ARE A BEAST!!! I love this interesting nice novel. Alison Weir has wonderful books. HO DARE YOU one stars and MAYBE two WRECKED this book!!!
5,definite edge of your seat,"Power, Corruption, Jealousy, Imprisonment and Murder. The Princs in the Tower is tale as oold as time and still to this day an unsolved mystery of England's greatest period. Tantalizing and intriguing Weir did a fantasitc job researching this project and has done a wonderful job giving those details to the readers."
1,Very flawed and inaccurate,I read the book after reading several other historical novels. This one particularly struck me as inflammatory and just out to make a buck out of taking the prosecution's viewpoint.The information presented to the reader didn't support the position the author was taking on the innocence or guilt of Richard III regarding the murder of the two princes.Don't waste your time.Read instead: DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey or SUNNE IN SPLENDOR by Sharon Kay Penman
1,Traditionalist view of Richard III,"While Weir asserts that she is providing an unbiased and even-handed account of the murder of the Princes in the Tower, she seemingly starts with the a priori assumption of Richard's guilt. She is in fact putting forth the traditional Tudor propaganda version of the event. The problem is in her evaluation of sources. By arguing that St. Thomas More's account of the murders (""its very detail argues its authenticity"") is true and ignoring the numerous and serious discrepancies and inconsistencies as well as factual errors, she is revealed as a rabid and biased anti-Richard. Nevertheless, she does bring an interesting point up concerning velvet apparently found with the ""bones in the tower."" Unfortunately, she does not adequately document her source here, leaving her assertion on even this point in question"
1,i threw it across the room,"After years of reading historical fiction about Richard III, I graduated to reading scholarly works, all of which have concluded that there are tremendous doubts surrounding Richard's reputation. Portraits have been scanned and have shown that the hump was added, many of the sources Weir uses, whom she says are contemporaries of Richard's, were 8 or 9 years old (Sir Thomas More) when Richard was killed. Virtually nothing the man did, from birth through death, had any sense of honor, according to Weir. After boldly indicating that she would state the historical facts and allow the reader to form his/her own conclusions, Ms. Weir leads us down crooked paths and ends up forcing her interpretations on the reader. I was very disappointed in the book and the author. I don't mind reading opposing viewpoints, but this one offered far too many conclusions which were totally unsupported by most of today's historical scholarship"
2,Poor research,"While I'm sure that it's a wonderful idea to have a book that bucks the current ""underdog"" and ""Poor Richard"" trend of Richardian studies, the fact that I discovered three factual errors in the first ten pages dimmed my appreciation of this work. Given the subject matter of this and other of Weir's books, I'd say that it is writing on the historical equivalent of scandal sheets, and not for people who are interested in the time period and serious historical study."
2,Neither the last or best work on the subject,"Alison Weir is a good historian. Her works on the wives and children of Henry VIII are very readable and make some excellent points. This is what makes this work so dissapointing. There is little objectivity in this work, accepting hostile sources as fact without questioning their obvious bias. Weir also makes many leaps in logic that are not entirely supported by the facts.This mystery is not solved, nor will it ever. I recomend Paul Kendall's book, Richard III, or Bertram Fields (though it too has its problems) work Royal Blood"
3,Allison Strikes Richard...yet again,"Allison Weir's books are wonderfully readable histories. Therein lies a problem. While I have enjoyed and learned much from several of her titles, she consistantly paints Richard III in the worst possible light. There is much written about the Wars of the Roses and this, the last Plantagenet King, that Ms Weir ignores. Her prejudice against him colors her rendering of the possible truth in other sources. I strongly recommend a large dose of Josephine Tey's ""Daughter of Time"" as an antidote."
2,Not a very good telling of the tale.,"Most of the story herein assembled could certainly be more satisfyingly gleaned from Shakespeare's Richard III or More's own account, on whom she relies heavily. At the very least, I recommed following the genealogical chart provided in Antonia Fraser's ""The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England"", not the one included in this book. It is so glaringly flawed it made me crazy. This book is not for a novice on the subject."
4,Case against Richard III Laid out Clearly,"Alison Weir's thorough research is evident in every chapter. She first summarizes the events and the dispute between the Houses of York and Lancaster. Then using obscure documents and letters, she develops a detailed timeline of events following Edward IV's death. She adds to it her historian's sensibility. There is no doubt in her mind, that Richard III was directly responsible for the Princes' deaths. I must read other opinions as well, but her case is convincing.The only challenge to the book was that she assumes the reader knows the York and Lancaster followers well. I had to go back many times to figure out players' allegience."
4,Who is the murderer?,"I spent much of my summer holiday reading this book, and I thought it was a rather good book. The family trees in the book are very helpful, and the information she gives about the main family members was very useful.I have read one book about this topic before, but I preferred this book. It is easy to read and the pages turned quickly. The author explains how customs and laws were different in those days, and why people responded and things happened in the way they did. And even though the book is packed with information about so many events and people, it does not get boring.So, I thought it was a rather good book, even though it somehow didn't reach my top 10 list. (On that list are books that I simply cannot forget and that I keep reading long after I actually finished them).And I found it interesting that she came to the same conclusion as the other author whereas who murdered the two children....."
1,Compelling but unresearched.,"Alison Weir is an excellent writer, but she gives too much credit to easily discredible sources. The book reads like fiction, but a large chunk of it is basic theories that have existed for centuries. ""The Sunne in Splendor"" is infinetly superior to this piece."
3,Just OK,"Historical accuracy aside, I was a bit disappointed in this book. I realize it's not a novel, and is written more like a history book. The first 90 pages jump around the bloodlines etc, and the information is repeated later in the book. Get past the first 90 pages and it becomes more readable."
4,Who is responsible?,"I found this to be a pretty interesting book overall. For people who say that Alison Weir did an axe job on poor Richard, they are right! Was Weir bit bias against Richard? Yes, she appears quite bias and that's showed quite a bit. But she was trying to make a point in this book. The point is that Richard III was responsible - directly or indirectly - of usurping and murdering his lawful King to be (his own nephew) and his brother. For people who may have been sway by reading Paul M. Kendall books or Sunne in the Splendor by Sharon Penman, that may be hard to swallow. There are many folks out there who refused to believed that Richard III can be a murderer of children. But the two princes disappeared from sight forever during Richard's period of power and no one will have the guts to kill royalty without expressed permission from royalty. Weir make that pretty clear in this book. Agreed or disagreed with her evidences and facts, certain aspects of history remains constant."
5,The case against Richard III proved.,"All right, I admit it, I was one of those people who read 'Daughter of Time' by Jospehine Tey when I was young and believed every word of it, what a nice man Richard was, he couldn't have possibly murdered anyone, he was kind to children and loved his mother etc. Then about ten years ago I read this book and realised how deluded I had been. Alison Weir sets forward all the evidence in a clear and concise manner that I think anyone could understand, even, I would have thought, the most fanatical Ricahrd III supporter. If you can read this book and still believe Richard was innocent, then I admire your loyalty but don't think much of your common sense. He did it. Case proven."
3,OK BUT BIASED,"Alison Weir in general, writes very good bios, but this one was just a little too anti-Richard. I am not convinced that Henry VII couldn't also be responsible. He was greedier, and more likely to kill people to get what he wanted. Not bad, but not great."
3,A good read but nothing new,"I have read as much as possible about the princes in the Tower, including Paul Murray Kendall's revisionist biography of Richard III, and while Weir's book is interesting, it is incomplete and certainly draws no startling conclusions. Even considering this, however, there is still no compelling reason to doubt her conclusions that Edward V and his brother died at the hands of their uncle. Richard III was probably not the evil, half-crazed hunchback of popular lore, but he was likely no less vicious than the other powerful men of his times. While his guilt in this matter can never be conclusively proven, and the claims of his innocence have some degree of plausibility, I still see no reason to think that anyone other than Richard III was behind the apparent murders. The fact that Tudor historians may have unfairly vilified him in later years does nothing to contradict this."
1,A Tudor View,"I was tremendously disappointed in this book. Alison Weir excells as a biographer and historian of the Tudors, and I have thoroughly enjoyed many of her books. In this one, unfortunately, she appears to be less an historian than a Tudor supporter. Richard III did indeed have reason to have his nephews killed. So did others, and Weir hardly gives them a glance. I am inclined to give poor Richard the benefit of a doubt, but I'm not convinced of his innocence. Still, I think Weir is too impressed by the myth of More and shamefully inclined to pick and choose amongst the sources she finds credible. Isn't it strange that all of the anti-Richard sources seem to be credible when none of the reverse are? My respect for Ms Weir as an historian has been badly shaken by this volume."
2,What a surprise,Having read her other books and enjoyed them I looked forward to this one. What a surprise! It should carry a warning on the front cover that Ms Weir is a Tudor fan. Sources were quoted selectively. Sources were a little doubtful. It wasn't what she included that disappointed but what she omitted to include. Too many personal conclusions were used.Ms Weir missed a great opportunity to deal with this wonderful mystery in an objective manner. Instead the more I read the more I began to feel she was attempting to prosecute rather than give an objective account. A great disappointment.
4,Holzman plays Lauro beautifully,"A very nice collection of pieces from an important guitar composer. There are other fine performances of Antonio Lauro's works by John Williams and David Burgess, for instance, but this CD certainly does honor to Lauro's musical contributions."
4,booster pump polaris for swiming pool,"found the best price on Amazon,I call several pool companies in the city and they were all higher in price,so therefore I found the same item on Amazon, the delivery box contain all the necessary fitting tubes and copplings so I was very happy to have everything I needed to do the job."
2,Barely lasts a year and a half (~6 months past warranty).,"Poorly made. Barely lasts a year and a half (~6 months past warranty). Will not buy again. This is in regards to the POLARIS PB4-60, 3/4HP 115/230V BOOSTER PUMP."
5,Polaris Pump,"Excellent & so much cheaper than ordering it from your local pool store. Highly recommend it, but if you are fuzzy with electrical work, have an electrician help you out!"
5,Whisper quiet,I bought this pump to replace my old polaris pump that looked exactly like this one. The big difference is this one is so quiet you can barely tell it is running and my polaris works beautifully. One note if you install this pump yourself you need really strong hands to get the hoses on and the fittings tight so it won't leak. I highly recommend this pump.
5,replaced pumed,"My old pump began singing to me as the bearings were starting to go. Took pump to shop and it was determined to be beyond economical repair. Found replacement pump less expensive than what the local stores were selling them for on Amazon. Ordered pump, received as advertized, installed, and it is working fine. Alot quieter than the one replaced plus it has all the latest upgrades. The one in the stores did not."
5,Zodiac Polaris Booster Pump,This beat the local prices and eBay bids when I needed to replace my pump. I was able to do the work myself and save a lot of money.
5,Essential for your Polaris 360/380 to work,"If you use a Polaris 360/380 to clean your pool, you must install this product or else there will not be enough pressure for your Polaris cleaner to work.This product boosts the water pressure to the hose connected to the Polaris cleaner so that enough suction is created to vacuum the pool.The product is well made and does what it claims. It is also long lasting. I live in the Northeast and use my pool about 3-4 months each year depending on the weather. I only recently replaced my original booster pump, which lasted 20 years.Before you buy this, search the internet carefully to make sure that you get the best price."
1,DO NOT BUY IT,I had it for 2 weeks and it started to leak. I can not believe it . It was new out the box . I got it installed by a professorial now i have to go though the hassle to return it .
2,pool cleaner pump,"i bought this pump ""TO REPLACE"" an existing one. pump comes factory set at 220 which i have. that mean 2 wires both hot and thats all you hook up with the ground of corse.i switched the pump out and after it ran for one day it had liquid in the cap with the capasitor. zodiac pool systems where this pump comes from, not made, said since i did the 2 wire switch over they dont have to warranty anything but out of the goodness of thier heart they would send the motor only and i have to switch the pump part over(i dont quilify to switch 2 wires that are the same current but i can swithch the pump)and it wont be covered by any warranty anymore and it could take 3 weeks to get. so for as much as this pump cost for one day in my case your on your own."
4,Polaris PB4-60 booster pump from Amazon.com,"This was the same pump that I was replacing but the description of the item was enought to know what pump I needed. Delivery time was less than a week which was surprising. I had replaced the current pump, however intructions were sufficient to do the installation. Overall very satisfied with the the pump and saved quite a bit from retail price at local pool supply stores."
5,POLARIS PUMP,PUMP PROVIDES GREAT POWER TO CLEANER. EASY TO SET UP AND NOT NOISY. SMALL FOOTPRINT. VERY HAPY WITH PURCHASE. NOT MUCH TO SAY IT IS PART OF THE POLARIS SYSTEM. YOU NEED A PUMP TO RUN POLARIS AND THIS IS THE NATURAL SELECTION
2,Leaky Fitting!,"The metal ring on the face plate which is displayed on the photo of the model is not present on the model which received. Thus, a fracture has occurred where the fitting screws into the flange of the plate, and subsequently a leak has developed. I've placed a compression fitting on the flange, but a small leak still persist. Is there a face plate compatible for this model that has the metal ring on it?"
2,Might make a good Christmas present?,"I ordered this book in a moment of inattention thinking it was something by the US Army Historical Section.It's certainly an impressive book in physical terms, weighing in at 5.8 kgs. (12.8 lbs). It is also lavishly illustrated, but to call it a ""complete history"" is overstating the case. It is a chronological overview of the high points (the low points are carefully skipped - don't expect to find Mi Lay in the index) of US military history with a heavy emphasis on the heroic and red, white and blue patriotic sentiment. The preface states something like ""Our soldiers are moral warriors who defend unchanging values etc. etc.""If you're a patriotic American and want to present a handsome gift to your local high school library, a gift that, who knows, may inspire some youngster to embrace the profession of arms, this book seems like an excellent idea.But if you're looking for 50 dollars' worth of serious military history, I would advise you to look elsewhere."
5,An epic page-turner,"In the annals of Irish literature about the Troubles and personal accounts of IRA involvement, Behan's autobiographical work stands alone. The text is at once witty, engaging, hilarious, sad, and enlightening.Arrested at a young age in Liverpool with the makings of a bomb, his youth saves him from the usual grim prison sentence faced by Irish terrorists in England. Young Brendan is sent instead to borstal, a sort of English detention center for juvenile delinquents.Behan emerges from the experience a changed man with reconsidered ideas about the world in which he lives.This book is simply the most interesting account of prison life I have ever read. This text is the sort that one will return to again and again in the run of the years."
5,"""The Compliments Pass When The Quality Meet""","Brendan Behan's memoir of his time incarcerated in England , is a comical, sympathetic and humanistic work of art. As a young IRA member arrested in Liverpool at the age of 16 in possession of explosives he demonstrated a remarkably fatalistic viewpoint for someone so young and seemed to take in the experience as an observant participant in a human drama without a hint of self pity.As he begins in a remanded prison before his transfer to London and ultimately to a Borstal (reform school) he meets with a variety of characters both fellow prisoners and ""screws"" or guards and they populate his story that also includes incredibly detailed descriptions of the routine of a life behind bars.Behan became famous as a playwright and notorious drinker in his later years and died tragically young apparently from years of heavy drinking. He is a writer of great insight and power and should not be missed by anyone interested in Irish literature."
1,Very disappointed!!,"The first table that I received had a 6 inch crack and was scratched as well, the box looked like it had seen better days. I returned that table and 2 days later I received a new one. The replacement table also had a crack, only about 2 inches, and one side of the leaf would not open. Had to send the table and 6 chairs back. It's a shame, because it is a really pretty set, but I guess that's why it was so inexpensive."
2,cracked table top,"There was a 4 inch long crack on the table top. And since the thing weighs a ton, and would be a pain to re-package, I will keep it. you get what you pay for. I know why it was $199 now; Its flimsy, but I needed something quick for the season, and i put the cracked side on the far end. I'll be shocked if it lasts more than 2 seasons. My guess is that by using some 3rd-rate shipper, you dont get kid gloves care with the furniture. Oh well, lesson learned."
5,Great Deal!,"This table arrived quickly, in perfect condition and was easy to assemble (based on previous reviews, I had the DSL guy help me unpack it to make sure there was no shipping damage.) This is a great value and looks perfect in my yard - it has elegant proportions and looks particularly sharp with a rectangular umbrella. With the leaves inserted, it sits 6 very comfortably and 8 isn't too much of a squeeze."
4,Table is wonderful- shipping was a problem,This is a beautiful table and very large. Shipping got messed up though apparently due to computer problems so the table did not arrive until after we needed it. Amazon was not particularly helpful until after the end of the shipping time (I knew there was a problem when all of the chairs arrived but I still had no table) Packaging was very poor and very torn up on this item (that appears to be a problem with all Strathwood items) but by luck the table survived and it is a very nice product which is why I will give this item 4 stars. (My reviews for the chairs were better due to perfect and very fast shipping)
1,Disappointed,I bought this to product to get into tight areas using the rubber whip hose. The dispensing fitting would move all over the place and I had to hold it in place and then try to use the lever on the grease gun. The pistol grip might have been a better choice.
1,poorly set up kit,"Unless you are using the ENTIRE contents of the kit at once, this kit is very poorly done. There is no way to measure anything less than using the entire bottle of resin and the entire tube of hardener, because you can't measure out the resin (opaque container with no measuring marks) and the hardener is simply a colorless liquid (no way to even go by color change on the ratio).Pretty expensive and wasteful and certainly designed this way deliberately to force the consumption of the entire kit at once.So, if you need to lay down about two square feet of fiberglass cloth (although if you did, there is no way to soak that large a piece with the contents of this kit) at once, then, not a bad kit."
1,Boredom Squared,"My opinion on this book has little or nothing to do with the fact that it was written a long time ago. It has to do with the fact that the people reviewed, although interesting people, all started to sound the same by page 35. If insurance agents are really this borring, I'm going to eat my gun."
5,This is a beautiful and thoughtful book.,"The illustrations in this book are magnificent.Each page appears as an illuminated manuscript. The characters (the King and Princess) have 'off-white' complexions--which make them very appealing for some under-represented students.The story is well written, though a bit predictable and is very meaningful in its strong environmental message.We used it in school as a model for writing and illustrating stories with a message."
3,Too preachy,"Well, I'm giving this book three stars because my daughter likes it. But not five stars, because I don't like to read it. There is too much preaching disguised as dialogue. I believe that a moral should evolve throughout the story in the forms of actions and consequences, not in a moralizing dialogue.Since I have to read it aloud, I figure I should get a vote too.I felt like I was reading propaganda--and I realize the book has a valid environmental theme, but I wish there had been more of an attempt to integrate the beliefs into the story."
4,This was a great movie! Rent or Buy this movie TODAY!,"13 Going On 30 was great.It is a nice movie...I don't really recommend it for like 7 year olds because there is some swearing and other things that you might not want them to see. It is PG-13. Jennifer Garner does a really good job in this movie.13 Going on Thirty is a movie to make popcorn, get comfy and enjoy the movie!"
4,VERY enjoyable,"1) You can read the editorials or other reviewers for what the story is about...suffice it to say that there is always a bit of suspension of belief, otherwise the story worked well enough2) The humor in the beginning didn't make me laugh very much, as it seemed just a rehash of the same old stuff3) But...about 45min into it my wife and I were in fact laughing out loud at this out-of-time & place character's antics4) Nice change from Gardner's Alias butt-kicking character. She has a genuine sweetness and innocence about her and this role was perfect.OVERALL: It was a refreshing movie that generated laughs and even some tears. This is one of the few ""memorable"" romantic comedies of the past two years."
5,For all ages,"Since I prefer to believe that I have grown past the cheesy teen movies, I was a bit apprehensive of this one. However, I gave it a shot since I have failed to grow past the mushy happy endings to the romance flicks... Garner plays a thirteen year old in the body of a thirty year old with much élan. She is very convincing as a sweet and innocent thirteen year old who discovers thirty is far from what she has perceived. A fascinating story with some basic lessons of love, family, and friendship attached as a bonus. (given that it has loopholes, but seriously, look past a few and just enjoy )I recommend this film as a staple-diet for all romance fans."
3,"No ""Big"" Deal","If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then I would give ""13 Going on 30"", a female variation of ""Big"" , an ""A"" for effort but a ""C"" for execution. It is enjoyable enough but after your done watching this confection is ""So what?"". Jennifer Garner is utterly charming, as always, as Jenna, the teenager who desires to be an adult. That said, even an actress as adept as Garner cannot overcome the lightweight script. Garner, unlike Tom Hanks, has to hone her chops as a comedienne to carry a starring vehicle. I'm optimistic that in the future that as she is given more opportunities(and better material) that the sky will be the limit for Garner. Mark Ruffalo seems to fare better in this film, but the demands on him are not as great. Special note should be made for young Christa Allen who plays Jenna at 13 and does an outstanding job."
1,The worst special edition ever,"This is the biggest waste of money that I have found yet. Not only are there no extras on this ""special edition"", but the ""alternate beginning and ending"" are done with different actors and actresses. (I use the term actors and actresses VERY loosely). This was the biggest rip-off I have ever seen. I LOVE the movie itself. don't get me wrong. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. The thing that gets me is that they billed this big special edition on the premise that we would see an alternate beginning and ending, and then they use different people. It makes no sense. Don't waste your money."
2,OK WOULDNT BUY,"EVERYONE SAID HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE WAS SO I RENTED IT. I FELL ASLEEP AN HOUR INTO IT IT WAS SO HORRIBLE. ITS YOUR TYPICAL SNOBBY GIRL VS UNPOPULAR GIRL MOVIE. ITS VERY MUCH LIKE THE MOVIE ""JUST FRIENDS"" BUT YOUNGER. MY SISTER WHOS 14 COULD PROBABLY RELATE VERY WELL TO THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ITS MORE FOR HER AGE GROUP. IF A TEENAGER HAS A SLEEPOVER THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH. ANYONE PAST THE AGE OF 15 MAY NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. WERE JUST PAST THATS STAGE IN LIFE."
2,It's all been done before....and better,"The chick flick version of Tom Hanks' ""Big."" Jennifer Garner is sexy and funny in this one but can't save the film from an awful script. Judy Greer gives a great comedic performance as Garner's back-stabbing co-worker and has a lot of fun with it. But besides this subplot, the film suffers from an overload of massive romantic comedy cliches and one of the most laughable movie dance sequences ever filmed. Look elsewhere for a good time with Garner, like her TV series, ""Alias"""
2,"Stick with ""Big""","Thirteen-year-old Jenna somehow leaps forward in time to inhabit her own adult body (Jennifer Garner), thereby discovering that she has become a terrible human being who will betray anyone to win acceptance from the right clique. Trying to reestablish a relationship with the now-adult boy (Mark Ruffalo) who was her childhood best friend before she ditched him, she discovers the importance of friendship and loyalty.This tired film revisits the body-switching theme that has been done so many times before in much better films. Garner overacts terribly at times, but she has some nice scenes with Ruffalo, who plays the only character that displays any intelligence. I never believed in the authenticity of its fashion magazine setting. Jenna's big idea for the magazine redesign, which receives so much applause, is unbelieveably bad."
2,Cute...But Useless.,"I know this is supposed to be a ""cute"" movie, but it is such a tired subject. It is ""BIG"" all over again....Granted, Jennifer Garner is much easier to look at than Tom Hanks....At least from this Male reviewers perspective. Garner is capable of SO MUCH more than this (Daredevil, Elektra). Garner is still good, as is Rufalo, and the film is good for what is supposed to be, it just falls a little flat due to it's re-tread subject matter. Still worth the $2 rental.....but not the late fees. 2 Stars."
5,A MUST SEE!!,"This movie is hilarious! Be careful for what you wish for, or it just might come true. This movie is great for all ages! Even my mom loved it! It is a lauph out loud romantic comedy, that will teach your kids a few things! You have to order this movie, NOW!!"
3,Pretty good going on good,"I wasn't a big fan of this movie. Even though it was very touching, and I could relate to her wanting to be popular, the movie's good moments just can't overcome the big flaw of this movie... bubble- gum fantasy. Instead of having her work through the challenges of being 30, she just cried once, then found some wishing dust and everything was fine. If you came to 13 Going on 30 looking for a solution to a problem you have been having, you've walked into the wrong movie theater. Don't get me wrong, there are some very funny moments, and I loved the message that every big choice you make throughout your life counts, but it would have been very nice to actually see them solving their problems in a realistic way, and let's not forget the very few good performances in this movie."
4,CHICK FLICK,"This is definitly the Chick Flick of the year! Jennifer Garner had the cutest wardrobe I've ever seen. The movie made me laugh and cry. The ending was just perfect. There was a new face that I have never seen before. It was the lead man, he was very cute and Jennifer and him looked perfect together. The music was also great. This is a must get soundtrack. If you love 80s music you'll love this. The movie great for a girls night out. I loved to see Jennifer Garner in a Romance-Comedy and the part fit her perfectly. Bottom line I LOVED IT!"
4,13 going on 30,it was a good moviei liked the dollhousemoney well spentjennifer garner played a good part in the movie
2,Not very good,I didn't think this movie was very good. It was a light comedy and had a few chuckles but mostly it was just nothing special. Jennifer Garner stars with her freaky strange face as a little girl that wants to be an adult and thru the miracle of magic dust gets her wish. So its then the movie Big without Tom Hanks regurgitated for a girl but not as funny or origional. Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress. She isn't horrible but she is just not that good. I would recommend this movie to girls and women who seem to like this kind of fluff.
1,Generic&Corny,"heard things about this film&I though it might have more to it but basically what is different between this film&freaky Friday? same type of concept&film. it's also a Insult to compare this film to Tom Hank's ""Big"" which was a Coming of Age Film for Hanks. Jennifer Garner is foxy chick,but Her Acting skills lets say are average at best. I also get so tired of all of these type of movies using the 80's music as there backdrop.they turn film into a Mini Music video as to a actual film."
1,CORNY AS HELL!!!!,"I caught this cornfest on cable a while ago, it sucked! If youwant to see a great version of this movie, see Big, with TomHanks! I can't believe so many people liked this trash, but thenagain, I can't believe George Bush got re-elected either!"
4,Pretty Good,"It was a pretty good movie... though not the best. It was better than I thought it was gonna be though. It was kinda corny at times... but a lot of it was really funny. The thriller scene was kinda corny but it was really hilarious. It was a pretty good movie but it seems like one of those movies that are good the first time but not so great after the second, etc."
2,Lacking humor and a solid plot.,"If you are looking for a movie with plenty of humor, look elsewhere. Now that that's out of the way, let's move on to entertainment factor. This movie, in my opinion, is quite absent of that as well with a confusing/boring plot. Some examples of this are: 1) the way characters react to the 30-year-old ""Jenna""s questions/confusion/etc which is so unbelivable that it detaches you from the movie AND 2) when the grown-up version of her best friend, ""Matt"", just seems to magically appear where ever she goes throughout the city. I got tired of hearing ""hi Matt"" or ""hi Matty"" every 15 minutes. There are more, but these are just several examples of why I disliked it."
4,Perfect Love in 13 Going on 30?,"Movies (especially chick-flicks) these days tend to lean towards a depiction of a fantasy world. For example, I noticed in this movie that perfect love was falsely portrayed. Jenna and Matt's relationship was so sudden, where in reality it would have taken so much longer to reunite with someone. Their love was perfect because they had ""special moments"", not because they cared about each other and respected their weaknesses. I just think that they left so much out of those scenes, that love means more than starry nights."
2,great if you are a 13 year old,"bad plot about ""magic"" event in a child's life where she suddenly becomes a 30 year old. could have been a good movie if the concept had been turned into a better script"
4,Cute and romantic,This movie was very cute. A total throwback to the eighties. The music and the clothes are classic. It instantly takes you back to that era when the go-gos were the craze and Thriller was the best video ever made....and still is. Love it.
4,13 going on 30- Not as bad as expected...,"13 Going on 30 was suprisingly, a decent film, and all and all, I belive that I enjoyed. However, it was DEFINATLEY a chick flick. But hey, althought it was extremley predictable from start to finish, that didn't really ruin the jokes along the way, and I definatley will rent it agian. However, I do believe that it is not quite worth full movie theater price, but a video rental would be money well spent. When I first saw the preveiws, I thought it would be a load of crap, until my friend forced me to go and see it with her. It was unexpectdley funny, and maintained the humor even when the whole bonding, sentimental scenes took place. All around funny, yet loving, and leaves you with that ever-so-popular saying after seeing a feel good chick flick, [AWW]! I give it four stars and two thumbs up for it being a suprise about the pleasantness of the tale."
5,Really funny movie,Just saw the movie yesterday & it was really funny!!!! An absolute must see for everyone who is a child in hart.
4,Cute and worth the $$,"Cute chick flick and worth the money. We had a good time at the preview tonight. Movie delivered a good time as expected. Garner and Ruffalo are good together, the movie has an awesome soundtrack and the vision of the film is good. It may take a bit of a leap once or twice but nothing we couldn't keep up with! Cute movie for mothers/daughters, also good for friends nights out!!"
3,Not nearly as good as I'd hoped,"I'd read at the time this movie was released that the only reason to watch it was Jennifer Garner, the script was ""Big"", warmed over. Supposed to be a comedy, I just didn't get many laughs out of it. Ms. Garner was good as a 13 year old who wakes up in a 30 year old body but you have to wait almost an hour into the movie for the best bits of that. I felt like the movie at only 98 minutes could have been a little shorter.It has it's moments but this movie is better suited for the girls (females of less than legal age) than the male audience."
2,"Yes girls, you too can GET MARRIED!","You're not gonna believe this, girls, but ... when you grow up, you can be pretty, wear lots of make-up, stick to a diet, and work in a fashion magazine where you tell other girls how to be pretty and wear lots of make-up and stay on diets. And there's something EVEN BETTER. Guess what? You can GET MARRIED to a BOY. You'll have to work really hard and simper and be really really cute, and be honest and naive and pretty much untainted, and repent for any past sins you may have committed, but if you do all that, you might get to be with a boy with a good career who won't be mean to you!!!I can't really answer for what's going to happen to you if you're ugly, or screwed up or whatever. I think you might get to be the secretary, like in this movie. And if you're lucky, the pretty girl might be nice to you and let you do all the footwork for her. So there's something to look forward to for everyone!"
1,Juvenile and boring,"If I had seen this movie when I was thirteen years old, I'm sure that I would have loved it - but as an adult, I had to force myself to stay awake. The plot is simplistic and silly, and while Jennifer Garner has loads of charm, she's not a good enough actress to be believable."
2,A Renter,I was mistakenly trusted the reviews on this one. Although it was inoffensively harmless it was far from a classic comedy and definately does not need to be a permenent member of anyone's DVD collection unless you ARE actually 13.Although Andy Serkis was an interesting addition to the cast yet was underutilized. I hope to see him in more movies in the future.
4,Great Soundtrack for a Great Movie!,"This soundtrack adds fun and excitement to an already great movie with the classic 80's music. The music on the CD is actually in the movie, which is something that sometimes doesn't happen with soundtracks. The mixture of artists on the CD really makes it one that a lot of people can relate to,even kids like me who were barely alive to see the 80's. The people that were alive and kickin' during the 80's appreciate the nostalgic feel of the album too, I'm sure. The only let down that I saw was the fact that Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" wasn't on the CD. It plays a key role in the movie and I was disappointed that it wasn't included. From Pat Benetar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" to Billy Joel's little known ""Vienna,"" this CD rolls through the whole way. All-in-all, the movie was great and the soundtrack continued that greatness."
2,Wasted Possibilities,"The same that I can say about ""Eurotrip"" in his camp can be said about this one in its own. Sweet, over short, and abandons all kind of interesting possibilities of time-travel change-of-age films (and it had both!). Going from '87 to 2004 could've been a hell of a trip, but no comment is made on the changing times (out of a little joke about a cellphone). C'mon, Internet, PC's everywhere, CGI in your TV all the time, something needed to make Jenna wonder about change! (need not to speak about Blackberries or the Twin Towers!)."
4,"Thirty, and flirty, and thriving","My friend recommended this movie to me - neither of us watch much contemporary film, but she loved this one so much I thought I'd see what it was all about. I was pleasantly surprised.One thing that impressed me was the simplicity of telling and filming the story - no wacky camera moves or anything. That was really nice. I like when a movie is told simply.I felt that Miss Garner did a very competent acting job. You could tell she was very disillusioned with what she found she had become. Her 13-year-old naiveté carried over the gap.I also appreciated that the dialogue was not spiced every line with profanity and vulgar words. (Of course, there's that sleazy boyfriend of hers... oh, was he ever disgusting! Skip him! LOL!)Overall, a very cute, sweet movie. I still like my old movies best, but I'm glad I watched this one, and I definitely recommend it."
5,Lighthearted Fun,"Cute and funny, featuring a fabulous soundtrack and a great wardrobe for the leading lady. Not just another chick-flick. Fresh and fun."
4,Very good movie.,"For all it's a chick-flick, it's a very well-done movie with stellar actors, intelligently-written characters, and with not an entirely typical plot, so that's a win-win. I did in fact watch this before buying it, so I would rent it first, for anyone under 25, it's funny and engaging, for anyone approaching or in the age of 30 themselves, there are a couple trips down memory lane that'll bring back a bucket-load of nostalgia. Dancing the thriller. ""Burning down the house"" by the Talking Heads. The hair, wow, the hair. I'm not around thirty, so all I can do is look at it like anyone who wasn't from that decade looks at it, but hey, even I appreciate it in my own, post-modern, youthful, masculine way. It must be awesome, right? Anyway, the movie is. Rent it, and if you like it, buy it, it pays for itself after the first few watches."
5,Fun movie with a great message,I loved this movie. Great acting and a great message about how choices we make in life impact us.
3,13 Going on 30,"This movie is OKAY. AVERAGE. Nothing more. It is a bit of a rip-off of Big. See it if you always wanted a girly version of Big. If not, don't bother. It's funny, but not very realistic. She does not act like a 13 year old in a 30 year old's body. Like I said, it's AVERAGE."
3,13 Going on 30,"The film 13 Going on 30, according to me was actually a very cute film. I thought Jennifer Garner did a pretty good job and gave her audience something to laugh about. I can see how it might be looked upon as a girly movie though. However, there might be some male audience that can relate to it. The movie was basically about a thirteen year old girl who wanted to be in the popular group and decides to invite the ""popular group"" to her 13th birthday party. However, the party ends up being a disaster. That's is when she makes a wish to be grown up and ends up being a thirty year old woman. From there are we get to see all the situation the problems she goes through. Over all, I liked the film; I thought it was pretty good."
5,Alias Spy to Comedy Queen,"This is a must see movie. Jennifer Garner is fantastic and it is good to see an actress who is versatile and can keep herself from fitting into a stereotype. I was amazed to see her in a part like this and to do an outstanding job. This movie has such a down to earth quality that hits a lot of issues that teenagers may have with how they rank themselves in society and how they would like to be only to find that life has more to offer than fame and fortune. Also, to live out the theme of repeating history with lessons learned. This is a must see movie that warms your heart. I rate it highly for anyone to see."
3,Releasing the Inner Child,"I have just seen the preview for this movie and I had to write about it. I am glad to see Jennifer Garner in another movie after Dare Devil. She is certainly making herself known. 13 Going on 30 is the kind of movie that spins off from a'what if?' turned real. Every one wishes to be more older and independant when they're young. Now it's time to see what happened if you got your wish. It's like a new, modern version of the movie Big starring Tom Hanks."
2,Not-Very-Good-Rehash of Familiar Storyline,"Jenifer Garner is a very attractive young actress who may eventually learn to be an effective one. However, in this movie I found her performance as the teenager transformed into her adult self 15 or so years later to be irritating, single-note, saccharine and at times incomprehensible (this last complaint is not, I realize, primarily Garner's fault but rather that of a disjointed script and story). Mark Ruffalo, as her loyal teenage friend and her befuddled adult one, gave a decent performance but I thought he was miscast. In all, this type of story has been done way better in previous movies, most notably ""Big""."
5,LOVED THIS MOVIE!,"This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. It was funny and cute. Jennifer Garner did a great job. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes ""girly"" movies."
3,Minor neglected gem,"I very much recommend this film, and think that in fifty years it will be seen as a classic of its kind, much like It's A Wonderful Life has become, even though it was critically brutalized upon its release. It will also be noted that this film was the one that officially launched Garner on her way to film stardom. She can do action, comedy, and drama, and all better than the other starlets of the day, for she's a better actor than most, and has that girl next door appeal that makes her a goddess that Joe Average (think Mark Ruffalo's looks) can realistically believe he'd get. That's something in itself, and not to be underestimated in filmic appeal."
3,"Decent Rom Com in the tradition of ""big""","""13 Going on 30"" is a decent enough Rom Com about a 13 year old who through magic (never explained) wakes up to find herself as her 30 year old future self. Its two leads played by Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo are appealing and the plot has enough twists and turns to maintain interest. Despite featuring some awkward moments when Garner interacts with other 13 year olds both male and female, this film has its moments and provides an entertaining ride towards its inevitable conclusion."
3,"Kinda of a girly movie, but . . .","If you grew up in the 80's this movie is for you. All the memories will come rushing back when you watch this.The love story is better than the one from Big, but otherwise this is a big rip-off of Big. But I enjoyed it and Garner is adorable as a young girl in a woman's body. Is she Tom Hanks quality, maybe not, but she does a fine job and you believe it.Overall fair movie."
5,Very good metal band,Well some would call this gothic metal I won't. It seems that every band with a female weather she is a singer or not is a goth metal band. Well this seems to be far more of a Black metal band to me then a goth metal band.Any ways it is very good I like how the songs are long and very deep. To those who are look for a Slipknot or Korn sound well you are looking in the wrong area. This band is nothing like that at all. They are heavy very heavy. To heavy for MTV heavy.This is raw metal. :)
2,assumes the reader has intricate knowledge of Java,"This book lost me after its second example. Since I did not fully comprehend the sample class, it was difficult to keep up.It started up pretty good, with their first example being extremely easy to understand."
4,"Very good book - not perfect, but very good.","This is a great book for any Java developer who has heard about JUnit but hasn't really worked with it. The examples are plausible for real-world development, although by being ""real-world"" they tend to be slightly less simple than you would want for an introductory book. Still, the discussion of why and how tests can improve the code they are testing is very good. The techniques for in-container testing and testing J2EE components are useful, because these tend to be the most difficult components to unit test. All in all, this is a valuable resource for learning JUnit."
1,him music cd,"Good cd, but it had most of the same songs on that like three or four of their cd's have on them. So not happy I bought basically the same cd with a different cover on it..not cool at all. Gave it away."
5,IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT DOWN,Utility was impossible to put down. I found myself looking forward to my reading time every night and I mean every night. The characters grab your imagination and pull you into the plot and won't let you go. The twists and turns keep you guessing and coming back for more. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I've already bought extra copies for gifts!
4,Excellent Resource For Mare Owners,"As a mare and stallion owner, this book is a great resource for making sure both my mares, and outside mares have a great experience. There is some great information on making sure the mare is properly prepared, and what to expect, which as a stallion owner I am glad to see, as I have to explain to mare owners a lot of this.However, other than one very short section on collection, there is little information for stallion owners.The inforemation on costs, contracts, and supplies were very informative, and I will keep this book handy throughout the breeding season.If you are a mare owner planning to breed, get this book!! If you are a stallion owner just starting out, this will be a great resource."
4,I think there could be a bit more information,"All first-timers should have a copy of this book. It helped me have a relatively painless, sucessful breeding experience. My best advice other than getting this book, is to know who you are getting your semen from because there are a lot of semen ""wranglers"" out there who aren't the best handlers."
4,this cd makes my toes tingle like little elves are tickling,"When Tom Petty starts singing on the opening track, I felt like I was going to puke. But then it got better and better. By the end, I was ready to trade all my Milli Vanilli cds for this great album. Tom is my main man!"
1,He's spent,"Well, I thought I'd try Tom Petty again. I used to be a huge fan; I have all of his albums up to ""Full Moon Fever.""Unfortunately, Petty sounds like he's just about had it. Petty's songs have always been based upon pretty simple melodies and chord modulations, but...this..is...ridiculous. Talk about predictable chord changes. His songs no longer sound like effortless gems that were knocked off in 5 minutes. Oh, they still sound like they were knocked off in 5 minutes, but effortless ""gems"" they are not. His trademark vocal limitations, while once interesting, are now pretty darn embarrassing. He sounds like some drunken lug, slurring his voice up and down in a lazy, boring way.Maybe I'm just finally burnt out on Tom Petty. But more likely, Petty is burnt out himself."
2,My review is the only one worth reading because it is true,"Mike Campbell is a great guitarist, and Tom Petty's lyrics and beautiful melodies have a tendency to get stuck in your head. This album has the Heartbreakers playing with competence and skill, but the songs sound too cold and distant, and the lyrics are curiously bland. He's still got the skills, but Petty apparently needs inspiration. The songs sound depressing, like a suicidal sex maniac drug addict on his last day on earth. All of these songs just make me want to listen to Full Moon Fever. Maybe he should do a solo album again, and he should definitely write some songs with Mike Campbell. 'Runnin Down a Dream' blows away any Petty hard rockers on ""Echo"". Only devoted fans should buy this album, for others, try the albums ""Full Moon Fever"", ""Into the Great Wide Open"", or ""Damn the Torpedoes"" for great music and a great time."
1,What a bummer,"I completely agree with ""What the Critics Say."" This album was really, really, really disappointing."
2,More of why I like Tom Petty!,"This cd extends the music that was on so many of the previous efforts that I wish were longer. If you like Tom Petty's other cds you'll love this one! If you've never heard him before, try listening to Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers first. I've got tickets to see TP at the Gorge Amphitheatre on September 4th and it's going to be great!"
2,HOW TO GET FULL MOON FEVER PART TWO ?,"This is tiring. I miss those Full Moon Fever times. I miss bright and clear acoustic guitars, cracked electric guitars and tight drum beat. Tom or somebody else, do it again, please."
2,Lost cause,"Losing it? Petty's totally lost it ... at least on this lazy slab of retro-rough drafts. Since ""Full Moon Fever,"" Petty's somehow picked up a reputation as a ""master songwriter."" He may have had a way with a hook way back when, but a ""master"" would certainly take more care with the melodies and show more invention with rock's cliches. Many of the songs attempt Petty's by now painfully familiar 'folk' feel -- which means they drone on and on without getting any place. Even the one track he should ace -- the garage-y ""Free Girl"" -- is more volume than actual hooks. Comparing this to ""Hard Promises"" or ""Damn the ..."" will bring tears to your eyes."
2,Tom Petty's worst album,"I love Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, but what brings this CD down is not necessarily the material (which indeed is below normal TP standards), but the way it is performed. The band gives the flattest performance ever on a Heartbreakers record, and it sounds like they are just going through the motions. Tom voice sounds like he's just about burned out, or perhaps tired from putting out such an awesome string of albums since the late 70's. There's just no fire or spark behind these songs at all, and its a shame to hear such a bad album from these guys. I find it hard to believe that he doesnt still have a good album or two left, but sadly that may just be the case. A couple good tracks save it from 1 star, but that's all its good for, unfortunately."
1,"one and one half stars, actually, but lame in the extreme","If this disappointing mess is the best these guys can do after this period of time, they should hang it up. If they hadn't already acheived their stature, they'd be just another garage band having trouble booking gigs. Studio outtakes from previous recordings alone, by contrast, readily demonstrate the drop off in quality with this release. In the immortal words of H. Ross Perot, ""It's just sad."""
2,Unmemorable,"There are cds in my collection that I wasn't impressed with from the get-go. Sometimes months (or years) later I'll give them another try and I'll be pleasantly surprised that they are better than I had thought originally. This is not one of those. Let me also say that I'm a big Petty fan and it's hard to call him down on any of his albums but in this case I must. Other than the opening song there's just no dynamics to speak of and the songs just run into each other without distinction. In the course of a band's career there are bound to be lulls and, unfortunately, this one qualifies for that title. But Tom and his gang weren't gone just yet. They rebounded well with the powerful and controversial ""Last DJ"" that showed them to still be the true rock and roll rebels they are."
4,So Under-Rated It's Criminal,"One More Day, One More Night makes me want to give it 5 stars (the albums closer) but I don't think that is right. Still, you should own this album and rock out to it. If you love Tom Petty, you will love this album.Not Pettys' best, but that doesn't matter. It's still excellent."
4,Does Petty fear predictability?,"That's the only thing I can think of to explain why he starts this album with a slow one (""Room At the Top Of the World"") rather than something fairly upbeat (there are a few of those anyway). Maybe I'm narrow-minded, but I think Petty is at his best when he rocks. What drew me to him in the first place was his fusion of Byrds and Rolling Stones styles (which hadn't occurred to me could be done). But all in all, this is a fairly consistent Petty offering--not great/ not lousy."
3,"ok, but doesn't echo back far enough","After reading several of the reviews, I finally figured out why I can't bring myself to rave about this recording (and I was long ago labeled a Petty fanatic by friends and family). In general, it seems that most of the favorable reviews come from fans that tend to gravitate towards his solo material, which has a distinctively different sound than the Heartbreaker recordings. The less flattering reviews, in general, seem to come from fans who tend to enjoy the earlier sound. This recording has some nice cuts, but for my taste, most of it sounds too much like Petty's solo stuff. Give me more of the earlier sound (i.e. Strangered in the Night, Wild One Forever, Too Much Ain't Enough, Magnolia) and less of the solo sound (i.e. Won't Back Down, etc.) TP & the HB's are still the Kings of live rock concerts, but this recording may disappoint the long-time fan."
2,All songs sound the same :(,"Only two songs that rock, Billy The Kid and Rhino Skin. The first 8 all sound the same like one continuous song. Slow melodic more of something fit for an easy listening radio station not really rock at all. It is similar to Springsteen's Ode to Tom Joad, nothing in it to really stir the emotions, just something to listen to to put you to sleep. You can really tell that he has been hanging out with Dylan too much. Alot of times Petty's sounds alot like Dylan. Really disappointed with this CD. Hope during the tour he does more old stuff and not much off this CD. Only people who want to own everything by Petty should buy it."
2,Two Drink Minimum,"Budweiser should get a writing credit on this album. I would love to know how may beers T.P. had during the writing/recording of this mess. A fantastic wordsmith/composer has fallen into generic lines such as ""You've got a pretty face...you've got a pretty face...but it's such a waste""? What the heck is that? It sounds like a line my 8 year old brother wrote in his 4th grade english class.I love T.P. I really do. He's fun to drive to. But, good God....if someone has the licence plate number of the aliens who stole his brain, please send all information to: Tom Petty Brain Search c/o Lester Cromwell 1330 4th St. Santa Monica, CA 90401."
1,I want my money back!,"What a sad, mixed up, melancholy recording! Where are the rebellious rockers from the past that were advertised? I can't believe I waited for the store to open to be the first to buy this. As a TP&H fan since the 70's I have learned that a lot of their songs must ""grow"" on you. I assure you that none of these will because I'm not even going to put this in the CD rack for fear someone might accidentally play it. Whatever Tom's influences were for these songs I hope he gets over it soon. One bad CD does not a career make and I'll continue to be a Petty fan forever but this effort is such a disappointment. If anyone is thinking about buying this work PLEASE try to listen to it first. You may think it is Tom's greatest piece of work or you may think it's a piece of ----."
2,Have trouble seeing what all the fuss is about,"Despite what a lot of other people and critics say, I LOVED Wildflowers, which has become one of my mandatory Desert Island discs. I also think that Tom and the boys are legendary stuff as attested to by their long and highly productive career of seriously significant tunes. However, I was really looking forward to Echo, but kept falling asleep during most of it, despite one or two tracks that try very hard to be vintage Petty or hit some of the notes on his newer directions like 'You Wreck Me' did on Wildflowers. As a loyal TP fan, can't garbage this album, but when you compare it to Wildflowers, and then some of the fantastic old material released on the recent Anthology 2 CD set, Echo becomes instantly forgettable. Don't worry Tom, you can't be truly legendary all the time, looking forward to the next one."
4,"ECHO, and NO MORE--------"" A little strange ""","I like that this album has great length ( good number of tracks ), BUT..... the song's ""ECHO and NO MORE"" are really STRANGE songs. I just don't get them. Since no lyrics where added (A MAJOR MISTAKE ), I have know way of knowing what, tom petty is trying to say in these two songs. As with all of tom's music, the music is good but sometimes the subject or words are really a tough one to see what he's singing about. This only happens once in a while ( don't get me wrong ), But it happened twice on CD. At least he didn't rip everybody off with NOT ENOUGH SONGS on the album. But in this case, 2 song's less is a BETTER ALBUM. STRANGE that the STRANGE song "" EHCO""...........is the title of the album."
2,"Wake me up, I've heard enough","If you like watered-down, dumbed down music, this may be your cup of (weak) tea. It's slightly better than Petty's last two albums, but that's not saying much. The Tom Petty & Heartbreakers that were so awesome in the 70's and 80's are not to be found here. Where are the intelligent lyrics that could be found on classic albums such as ""Damn the Torpedoes"", ""Hard Promises"", ""Long After Dark"", ""Let Me Up"", etc., etc., etc. Where are the great melodies and strong instrumentation of of all those (1976-1991)albums? The guitar and keyboard work on this album is actually quite good, but it's set so far back in the mix that it's largely wasted. This has the makings of a good album, but the lyrics, melodies, and instrumentation need to be worked out much more fully. Then again, if you are just looking for background noises to fall asleep with, perhaps this will serve that purpose."
5,PETTY STILL PERFECTING HIS FORMULA,"Although not as radio friendly as some of his latest albums, Tom still manages to hook, line, and sinker you with one. It does take a few listenings to grow comfortable with and truly enjoy, but it is well worth it. Initially feeling a little let down, I continued to listen to it and found it to actually be better than Wildflowers."
4,"""Echo"" does it again for TP","I was a little leary about buying the album at first since the critics were so rough on it, but I'm happy that I bought it anyway. Sure, it isn't the same hard driving rock of the earlier years, but Petty just keeps on growing. Anyone who has been a long time fan knows that whatever TP is feeling at the time he's working on an album is what you get, and since he was not in a ""happy place"" it shows, but I really enjoy his work. I actually don't like ""Free Girl Now"" but do like everything else. Nobody is worth going to see in concert more than TP, I hope to catch him on this summer's tour since it's been 4 years since I saw him last, and that's way too long!!"
5,Underrated and overlooked,"I've recently come back to this cd after not listening to it for awhile...my loss because this is one of the most consistent and mature rock albums Tom Petty ever made. There are 3 gems on this that pu this over the top for me : Room At The Top, Swinging and Ome More Day, One More Night. A great effort by the most consistent, tightest rock band around."
5,ECHO is the bomb,"Room at the top, Free Girl, Swingin, and underrated song like Rhino Skin are you kidding me he is god. The best c.d. of Tom Petty not including the greatest hits. Buy it I saw it live and it rocks. Most Under Rated c.d. in the U.S."
1,A lackluster forgetable album.,"I bought the Echo CD on the strength of the Wildflowers album, which is the only other Tom Petty music that I have purchased. In comparison the Echo album was a let down. I doubt if I will give Echo another listen since there were no memorable tracks and nothing about it warranted repeated listening. I should have sampled the CD before I bought it. Well now it's off to goodwill to get rid of this dud."
2,Not very impressed,"I bought this record to help complete my Petty collection. Room At The Top had me hanging on, thinking this could be another Wildflowers album. But where I thought this record would take me was not at all what I had expected. And it's not just that my expectations were floundered, it was simply that this record lost my interest after 3 or 4 songs. Many of them feel like half-hearted blues songs, that really don't mean anything at all.Anyways, I thought Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers were wonderful. As well as some of the others too, but I couldn't really feel connected to this record. I'm sorry."
4,Tom Petty CD,"Bought a bunch of Tom Petty CDs for my wife, as she is a big fan. It arrived in time and was in good shape, just as advertised. Packaging was good and I am quite happy with the purchase. (she is happy, I am happy...)."
3,Fantastic music but CD not for ripping,"The music is fantastic, I like all of the songs. The reason for three stars: If you try to rip the music to add the songs to an I-pod or if you wanted to make a personal copy to prevent damage to the origanal or if you like to edit the songs by ripping the CD, forget it, the music comes out staticy throughout all of the songs, (probably anti-theft in the CD). I haven't tryed to put the songs into the I-tunes library to play on an I-pod, maybe that will work, I won't be able to take out f-words or repetative phrases. The CD plays perfect on a player, just be aware of this hidden goodie that comes with this CD."
5,Beautifully soulful.....,"I love the ""down to earth"" lyrics, backed by the wonderfully matched instrumentation of ""The Heartbreakers"". This is now one of my favorite albums. Every song is memorable!"
4,My public service,"This is not the best CD T P has made but it's a solid effort. ""Swingin'"" is one of my very favorite Tom Petty songs. A classic!By the way of the 6 one-star reviews 5 were posted on the same day by ""a customer"". Amazon really shouldn't allow that..."
4,"Well, it's Tom Petty.","You can't really go wrong here. It's Tom Petty. If you love him, you'll love it. If you like him, you'll like it. And if you're one of the select few that don't like him, well, shut up. Tom Petty's work is amazing on all levels and will always be so. Great writing and song construction across the entire disc."
2,Where's the melody I'm used to?,"It feels like Tom Petty is trying to do something else (or new?) on this release, but most of the time it's just not any good. I miss the melodies I fell in love with and I think the material on ""Echo"" is quite monotonous and uninteresting with the exception of ""Room at the top"", ""Counting on you"" and ""Accused of love"". If you compare this with albums like ""Full moon fever"", ""The great wide open"" or ""The last DJ"", it's clearly not as good."
2,This dude is turning into a hippie!!!,"From the nasally, up-close vocals of the first lame ballad, to the ending chords of the last song, Tom Petty is turning into a serious hippie!! Just listen to his lyrics about freedom to smoke dope, running around in the grass, and all this Lenny Kravitz type junk about ""letting love rule"". In my opinion, Petty should stick with the jangly songs he wrote of yor, where every song was a guaranteed FM rock staple. These days he sounds tired, weary, and put off by everything under the sun. For a hippie, he's pretty uptight about stuff.Well, that's about it. If you like hillbilly rock, check this one out. Otherwise, stick with that other brilliant hippie dude, the one and only Neil Young.CHECK YA' LATER, DUDES!!"
4,clasic Petty,"This cd is clasic Petty.There are only a few groups out there that I cant wait for their new stuff,Neil Young,The Dave Matthews Band and Clapton This is one of them Petty and the Hearbreakers rock!Rock on Tom!"
5,Petty cuts his Summer Teeth,"I can't tell you how pleased I was to hear this record so closely on the heels of the latest Wilco release. Both share a smart pop freshness absent so long from rock and roll.This album isn't as consistent as the Wilco record, but I've not heard a Petty/Heartbreakers album yet that wasn't a little uneven. Petty makes up for it, though, with numbers like ""Echo"" and ""Room at the Top.""Just as good in its own right as any Petty ""classics,"" ECHO will likely establish a place among your favorite records this year. This one hasn't left my discman all week."
5,An artist you can count on!,"There are only a handful of artists who have consistently put out good music. Like Neil Young, Tom Petty, is one of those artists who have stayed true to his roots. I would have bought this album even without reviewing it, because you know what to expect. Thanks Tom"
3,Echo's of Past Glory,"Not his best work, but much better than some recent efforts (She's the One comes to mind). Room at the Top and Free Girl Now and Swingin' are great. My only problem is that most of his ""rockers"" now all sound the same (e.g. they're all in the mold of You Wreck Me). Here's looking for a little more diversity next time."
4,Not Bad At All!!,"The greatness of this records has to do with the fact that Tom Petty hasn't changed a bit. With ECHO, Petty has succeeded in combining the wholesome melodies of WILDFLOWERS with the loud, ""in your face"" guitars of DAMN THE TORPEDOES. The ballads are bluesy and heartfelt, while the ""hard rockers"" still remain. The only problem is the fact that two of the songs sound similar. Otherwise, it's great!"
4,Go Tommy!!! Now i rememeber why I love him so much!,"Worth the years of waiting, although I hope he doesn't make me wait so long for the next one!!"
3,Average Tom Petty And Heartbreakers Cd,"The new cd by Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers is just as good as any of their previous cds. The sound is the same, Tom's voice is sounding great. Although the cd is pretty much the same as their previous cds, I think a couple of their previous cds are a tad bit better. Still not a bad investment for a fan to pay."
2,Pretty boring,"Lots of the same thing. Every song sounds like every other song on the disc -- or in Petty's career of late, for that matter. Nowhere is there a song of a quality anywhere near what can be heard on his early albums."
2,Boring,"I was expecting a lot more from Petty on this CD. I think the highlights are ""Rhino Skin"" with its strong beat carrying the song, ""No More"", with its beautiful 12 string guitar and the driving ""Free Girl Now"". Unfortunately, the rest of the album is boring with Petty's voice sounding weak and tired. I like his reflective lyrics, but the melodies to which they are sung are unimaginative. This disc is fair at best."
2,"I'm a disappointed Petty fan, this CD is a drag.","I been a fan since his very first album and was really looking forward to this one. But, aside from a few good tracks, Petty sounds like he's tired and just going through the motions. I hope the next ones better."
5,Great set of books,"Not sure what I was expecting after reading all of Griffin's other books about the military. He has outdone himself, again! The stories grab you and make you want more. Griffin obviously lived in Philadelphia at one time. He tells the story of a young policeman and describes his progression up through the ranks of the police department. Totally entertaining. You won't be able to put any of the books down until you finish them."
2,Not One Of His Better Series,"This whole series can be described in two words: poorly written! In The Corps or Brotherhood of War series, you have the feeling that Griffin must have been a military officer because he includes a lot of details that the average person wouldn't know if they hadn't served. With this series, I get the feeling that he never was a police officer, and didn't spend much time researching the daily lives of police officers in order to make the story seem realistic.However, while I doubt he's ever worked for the Department of Homeland Security or the Office of the President, I wouldn't let that stop you from reading his latest series, the Presidential Agent series. He is back in form with these books, so he obviously has enough contact with current or former DHS and/or White House personnel to understand how things work."
2,What Story?,"This book has proven to be a real loser. Characters out the Ying-Yang with no development. A plodding story that's supposed to be about a nut-case blowing up the VP of the U.S. Well, here it is: Nobody gets close to blowing anyone up, or catching anyone doing same until the 2nd page from the end of the book and then it just ends with everyone living happlily ever after. Very dissatisfying. The entire book leads up to a ""Oh-By-The-Way"" ending. Schlock like this will get you a failing grade in High School Literature."
5,A great book for the beginner,I have quite a few books on Quantum Mechanics. This book does what the others do not. The first half is about simple math. Understanding that QP - PQ = ih/2pi is the matrix form of an equation and the QP - PQ is not zero because the matrices do not commute is critical. This is basic stuff that a lot of books just skip. The second half uses the math to explain some of the features of Quantum Mechanics. For me I needed the detailed first half even though the math was not too hard. Now I can read my other books with a new understanding and finally I am starting to understand Quantum Mechanics.
1,Dover's paper quality has declined sharply,"The one star is not for the text, but for the quality of the paper and printing. Dover used to dependably print their technical books on good quality paper, but this book had astonishingly bad paper, and the ink bleeds into it. At least, I won't feel bad marking it up... They seem to have used the paper they use on their one dollar classic novel reprints, or worse."
3,Jordan half-strikes again,This is very good as far as it goes but large chunks of important quantum theory have been deliberately omitted thus devaluing the book's ultimate usefulness. It is not up to the standard I expected from the author's book on Linear Operators
2,The glass is half full on this project,"To do a celebration of Richard Rodgers music is simply grand. Without question he was the backbone of what we have come to know as ""Broadway Magic"".For this occasion the Boston Pops did a good job of paying tribute to this master tunesmith. I think Richard would be more than proud to see his masterpieces performed in such a manner.BRAVO to the B.P.O.!If there were any shortcomings to this project it would have to be two things. First, I felt like they should have used better vocalists. Second, I felt like the repertoire was not as good as it could have been. Some of the tunes performed here I really disliked. I can think of a lot of songs I would have rather been listening to.I think it would safe to recommend this cd to all the die hard Richard Rodgers fans."
3,"Rodgers - 5, Pops - 3","Keith Lockart is certainly a solid heir to the Boston Pops of Arthur Fiedler. His performances are crisp, and lively. The Pops likes working with him, and it shows. And, I own every Keith Lockart/Boston Pops disc so far. But....although there were some interesting additions to this repertoire, especially the scenario of ""Victory at Sea"", I was really turned off by the so-so vocal renditions. They really detracted from the overall fun of the disc. Certainly the music of Richard Rodgers is timeless (not EVERTHING he wrote was delicious), but Lockhart missed the boat with this one. It's a neat album if you have a player that can pick and choose what you listen to, but after the first few tunes, I got a bit restless."
4,Better than I thought it would be,This film follows in the tradition of the Child's Play and Puppet master films. It is a pretty entertaining low budget sci fi effort and is very funny at times without taking itself too seriously.
4,Graet book,"Its good that I am able to find books in spanish here, I like it and the price is very reasonableThanks you"
1,Sickening.,"A father takes the law into his own hands, shooting point blank (with premeditation) two handcuffed men who raped and beat his daughter. This is vigilantism, this is murder. His alcoholic lawyer gets a no-good ""psychiatrist"" to testify that the man is insane even though everyone knows that he is not.A clear-cut case for the death sentence except for one thing: the murderer is black and the victims are white, and the novelist, Grisham, is a white-bashing racist. The murderer is acquitted BECAUSE he is black.Don't bother with this piece of trash."
1,For The Birds!,Arrived bent and when set up crooked. HUGE disappointment. The problem is there are not a lot of choices out there.
2,So-so...would not recommend,"I was a bit leery about ordering this stand given the negative reviews about shipping/packaging and missing parts. I ordered it anyway. The stand is ok, though it does have some rust visible from various screw holes. The packaging is the worst I have ever seen in all my years of ordering via the internet and from Amazon in general. Surprisingly, all the parts were included and undamaged. The bird seems to be hanging securely away from toddlers and my dogs (my main concern), but the jury is still out on the product. We may still return it. I would not recommend this bird stand to anyone, even for the inexpensive price.UPDATE: Ten months after purchasing this stand, we are satisfied with it. It has held up and the bird is secure."
2,Amazon is AWESOME...PetSolutions...NOT Impressed!!!,"Never Received product from ""PetSolutions"" (Wrong Address), and ""PetSolutions"" never made an attempt to ""rectify"" the ""purchase""!!!

3,Bird stand,"This is a good, simple solution to bird cage support that doesn't consume a lot of space. The bolts/fasteners included aren't really adequate for stablilty. Had to buy some a bit longer with locknuts so it doesn't wobble."
5,Bird Cage Stand,It was fantastic! I was very happy with the stand. I've been shopping around for one like it for a while and I found it!! Best of all shipping was FAST!! Thanks to everyone at Ozbo and Amazon for taking care of me and my little birdy!
1,Misaligned screw holes causing unstable base,"Prevue Pet Products Tubular Steel Hanging Bird Cage Stand 1780 White, 24-Inch by 24-Inch by 60-InchActually: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DIU4I/ref=wms_ohs_productThe predrilled holes to assemble were misaligned, resulting in an unstable base. My solution, short of returning, was to place sticky felt pads on two of the base arms to stabilize it, resulting in an additional $5.99. I was very disappointed."
1,wobbling bird cage stand,"This is not a stable cage stand - which is not good for hanging a bird cage on. Two of the legs do not sit on the floor - so it wobbles back and forth. I have put 5 quarters to hold the cage steady - that is how much it is off. The packing box is not adequate, both times (I've had two of these because the first shipment was missing parts) not adequate because the shipper had to re-tape around the whole box. One one stand, the two tube parts would not go together - there seems to be some inconsistency in quality of manufacturing. I am unable to recommend this product."
5,Fantastic stand for a great price,I was so glad to get this stand. My poor bird's cage was sitting on the floor before that and I don't think he much cared for it! Now he's up at eye level and loves the view. The stand was easy to put together and is plenty sturdy for my cage.
5,Very Nice stand,I hung a parakeet cage from this stand and it is very sturdy. doesnt require too much difficult assimbly. comes in about 3 pieces that you connect and fasten with screws. it never tipped over or fell. Great buy.
1,Poor!!!,"This stand arrived in a damaged box, missing instructions, missing components for assembly and missing the end stoppers in the feet. This stand looked as if it was repacked from the damaged shelf area. Extremely disappointed !"
4,It's easy/simple to assemble.,This is not a facy bird cage stand but it serves its purpose. I think its worth the price. It was delivered on time and in perfect condition. It was very easy to put together. I like this product and although it is simple it still adds a nice flavor to my apartment......
2,Cheap and unstable!,I purchase this item a few weeks ago and I really don't like it. I put together and it is so cheap and unstable. When I put my bird cage on the stand it is so wobbly that I feel the whole thing is going to tip over. And I have a very small cage! Would not recommend. Very disappointed in Ca.
2,tubular bird cage stand,"The bird cage stand works as I hoped it would. The problem is that it has scratches all over it. Since each section of the stand was still wrapped in paper, when it arrived, I do not think this damage happened during shipping. Because the cage stand is so scratched up, I will not order from that place again; nor will I recommend them to anyone else."
5,Best Soundtrack,"I loved the movie, and the music is the best, relaxing but yet still good tunes to party to. Hands down the best soundtrack, and my favorite. I saw this movie in the fall so listening to the music reminds of fall. good stuff i absolutely reccomend it!"
4,Love it - but.....,"I DO love this disc - HOWEVER - I agree with ""Deceived and Disappointed"" - I wanted to get ALL of the tracks that were featured in the movie - there are some great songs missing! That was a big disappointment:("
4,Classic!,"Great soundtrack - reminded me of being a little kid (especially the Eagles song, ""Take It Easy"")and going to rockin' backyard barbecues where I'd steal sips of beer. Classic conglomeration of all the early '70s faves. Such a universal appeal - kids, even though it may feel like you're rummaging through your parents record collection, all of these songs transcend their time periods. I remember singing along to ""Free Bird"" in the back of a Camero long after the song (and the car!) was in style. Get this soundtrack, and go see the movie, too - it's kind of a chick flick disguised as a guy flick - which means that everyone will like it."
5,One stop shopping for timeless rock classics,"This record is for those who saw Outside Providence and those who did not. For those who did, the songs will happily bring you back to the funny and poignant scenes of this special movie. For those who have not seen the movie, the album reads like a ""who's who"" of some of the greatest, most popular songs of the last 30 years. Remember when everybody was updating their vinyl collection with CD's? Well, this record puts some of the biggest hits of all time on one cd. You don't need to dust off your vinyl and, just as good, you don't need to put on many different cd's to listen to these favorites. Highly recommended."
2,not her best,You may need to pass on this one. I would give it a 2 where I would give song bird a 10.
5,Eva Cassidy,"It was worth it for the one song, before she goes out of print. I had never hear this song before and was worth having it in my collection."
5,You can tell she's got a special voice,"If you listen to this album without first knowing Eva Cassidy, you may or may not spot how special her voice was. If you merely listen absent-mindedly, your 2010-trained ears may be be unimpressed by the circa-1988 melodies or song choice in general. But if your ear is discerning at all, and you focus on Eva's voice when it shines though the other elements, this early album should convince even a first-time listener that she's special. I didn't find ""Method Actor"" to be an album that I would impulsively return to, again and again--but the album deserves the attention of anyone who wants to appreciate Eva's voice and interpretations as a rare hidden treasure. I hope somehow she knew how appreciated her work would be, one day."
5,Every Eva Cassidy Fan Should Know. . .,"Spectacular! Eva truly was one of a kind. Now singing original music written, arranged, and sung to perfection! The heart of David Christopher must be tremendous. Through his words, Eva relays such honest and compelling emotion of pure love and adoration. ""Look Into My Eyes"" and ""Forever"" are two of the greatest love songs of all time; and who better to sing them than the one and only - Eva Cassidy! ""Laugh With Me"" is as happy as walking through a park on a brisk, Fall morning. ""Stay"" is a heartbreakingly beautiful song Eva sings with a vocal range out of this world! Only Eva. This CD is a *must have* in any collection - She sings not just about The ""Blues"" anymore - Eva sings ""Forever""!"
3,interesting,"I agree with a lot of other reviewers here, this is an interesting recording.I think that Eva's singing either isn't what it grows up to be or that the songs are not the right vehicle for her voice. I did like the first bluesy number."
3,Buy a Heart Album instead!,"I have every Eva Cassidy album on the Blix Street label and love them. This one is not on the Blix Street label. This is a great example of the growth of an artist and they kind of music she ""used"" to do. None of the songs are awful, but most of them sound like rejected Heart demos. If you're like me and want to have every recording she's ever made then get this one too. If you like listening to the Wilson Sisters buy a Heart album instead."
1,Scraping the Bottom,"I have every recording of Eva's,and play them regularly. I was delighted to find this in a tiny Ct. record store. What a disappointment! I always felt that Eva was very eclectic in her tastes. I know she was only a kid when she released this turkey with David Christopher's garage band. The enthusiasm other Eva fans have demonstrated in their reviews seems like mass hysteria and the madness of crowds. She left us a beautiful legacy of beautifully sung music of all styles. This unfortunate CD should never have been released Bob Johnson"
3,Not Eva's best work...,"It's not terrible, but it's just not great. I know and love all of Eva Cassidy's albums, and it's clear after listening to this once or twice that she really was just developing her style and musical preferences when she recorded this album. The voice is there, yes, but her heart just isn't, and that is the crucial element which is what makes her later singing so incredibly powerful. If you are a serious Eva Cassidy fan, it's worth a listen just for interest, but you probably will not listen to it very many times. ""Eva by Heart"" or ""Live at Blues Alley"" are much better introductions to her incredible singing."
3,"""Damn! That girl can sing.""","This is mundane material in over-blown and over-sung arrangements that seem archaic. The virtue the CD has is that Eva's voice stands out. She could sing the phone book and it would swing. Don't buy this CD expecting much, but the sweet, strong voice of Eva Cassidy makes a few tracks good, especially ""Getting Out"" and ""Forever."" Listening to this CD, even if I had never heard of Eva Cassidy, it seems so clear that she was an exceptional singer. Why didn't anybody notice her when she was alive?"
2,Listen once and move on,"I have most of Eva's solo albums and love them dearly. I regularly give them as gifts. When I received Method Actor I couldn't wait to give it a spin. Boy was I disappointed. This album is nice if want to hear her before she found her wings. But that is no reason to listen to it again. Overly dramatic music and lyrics, technically perfect, emotionally stale. Do your heart and head a favor and listen to ""Live at the Blues Alley"" instead. This songbird was too new out of the nest."
3,Rhea's Jingle Jungle Carrier Review,"I've only used it a couple of times because my daughter is too young to actually play with it or even realize that it's something to play with. I'm hoping when she gets old enough to hold toys and learn that they are entertaining she will take advantage of the Jingle Jungle toy. It's very cute and I'm sure that my dear Abby will enjoy it later on, especially on those long car rides we take frequently."
3,Ok,"The sound is a little weak due to small size of speakers.The cd unit played nicely.Has clock, kitchen timer, and auto-off timer which is great for working in the garage and forgetting to turn it off.But, I purchased the unit for radio reception and was forced to return due to lots of static and bad reception.Nicely packaged, I just wish radio reception was better."
5,very handy,"I am a birdwatcher, and take this into the field and play bird sounds. It is a great little CD plyr/radio-fits anywhere."
3,So-so,"Ok, I actually bought this book based on the review above.. I guess I should only buy a book if it has several positive reviews and not just one!SPOILERSThe story was alright but somehow it just doesn't seem believable that the heroine (I think!) remained celibate for three years! But then again, maybe it is true since they say its easier for women to control their urges again. The hero I guess is alright. At least it is sweet that he never let go of the love he had for his ""ex-wife"". Also it's the first time I read a book wherein the hero actually ""forced"" the heroine! Maybe that's why I wasn't too thrilled with the book. Considering this was a Harlequin romance, I guess I thought the hero wouldn't be that ""dark"". Also the ending/resolving of conflicts seemed a little rushed and happened a couple of pages before the ending."
3,Back Cover Blurb,"There's a post in the Romance Community titled: ""My 10 Most Hated HP's Of All Time"" and this one is listed at No.1 I've never read it personally (I've gave it 3 stars in order to post this successfully), but here's the back cover synopsis for it, which I found on another site (the one that sells stuff)!""You've forgotten how to be a woman!"" Zach Reedman's bitter accusation had been the death knell of his marriage to Julie.And even after three long years Julie still winced when she remembered his parting words. She'd been a budding journalist, he her publisher when they met.A love too strong & passionate to resist had led them quickly to the alter, but even after her vows Julie's career had come before her husband.Older and wiser, she met Zach again and as the wounds time never fully healed were reopened, so once more was her heart."
5,Haunting Rhythmic and Incredible!!,Sasha's 'The Myth of Red' in an incredible compilation of pieces that remind me very much of the vocals that Cirque de Soliel includes in soundtracks. I've also seen Sasha perform live (AMAZING) with Pendulum Arial Dance Theatre and was blown away...I'm a huge fan and collector of Cirque music and Sasha's voice and instrumentals is right up there.
4,worth the money!,"for those of us, willing to experiment, w/ different genres,and love world/downbeat music, yet still likes the music our folks listened to. Try this hauntingly beautiful mix of arias over trance beats. You won't regret it, it's getting the most play on my CD player, and anyone that hears it goes straight to the store to get their own copy!Must have-"
2,"I wanted to like it, but couldn't","Oh boy, I don't often write reviews except for music I think is exceptional, but with all the superlatives being thrown around regarding ""The Myth of Red,"" I thought I'd share my point of view: Overblown, in that peculiar ""Euro Tech"" sort of way. I love a good voice (and she's got one), and I like violin and cello with electronica, but this doesn't hold up. I sold it after not copying it!Along the same vein I highly recommend ""Close to Silece"" by Thomas Otten if you like an operatic/electronica recording which verges on the sublime. Peace."
3,Postmodern Opera,"Remember that weirdly wonderful techno-aria sung by the character Plavalaguna in ""The Fifth Element""? Well, here's an entire CD of opera/tek grooves like that one. But unlike the blue diva in ""Element,"" Sasha Lazard doesn't need to synthetically enhance her soaring soprano pipes. Here she mixes her classical background with Electronica, overdubs, plus some funky World beats, to a surprisingly successful end. Such hybrid music isn't for everyone: if you don't believe in messing with sainted Old Masters (Rachmaninoff and Rimsky-Korsakov; Ave Maria), steer clear. But if you're open to some audio fun that marries old and new (Princess Mononoke's Theme Song, DJ Spooky), go for it. These tracks are light clean fun guaranteed to evoke smiles at your next cocktail party."
4,"All right book, good for additional info","Makes Clarisents into much better psions, even for people who like to hack and slash. Clarisentsa at first seemed to weak, but other important uses for thewir powers are shared in this sourcbook"
4,A good first supplement.,"White Wolf has done well with the first area supplement for Trinity, making the least imposing group of characters - ISRA - much cooler than the original book. The color section is well done, and the information is valuable. My only complaints are that the B&W section blends player and GM information and there is too little equipment."
2,ALRIGHT,"A good, young cast wears thin after a while. Not really worth seeing unless you're a sports fan."
3,"Pretty good, but typical.","I first heard this song on the radio, and I thought it was pretty good but it did sound like everything else.The BSB,Britney Spears(who I hate but I'll rant on that later.), and N SYNC.So I forgot it until one day I saw this song on the Tommy commercial.I did not like that to much because it is kind of a sellout thing to do, but hey if you got paid as much as he did you'd do it too.And I don't believe that Hilfiger is his uncle, what a bunch of B.S.!Another stupid rumor for celebrity's to worry about.All and all it was a good song, but typical."
1,FAKE ARTIST,"Bad, bad, bad! This singer, has NO talent..the only reason why he has the commerical with Tommy Jeans, a Record deal, and a spot on Britney Spears tour is because his uncle is TOMMY HILFIGER! I bet a lot of you didn't know that?! There is a LOT Of talent out there, and it's a shame that somebody as bad as Michael Fredo gets a record contract just cause Uncle Tommy is rich. His voice is VERY limited in skills, and his songs aren't that good. If you want a good male artist, try Don Philp..and let Micheal Fredo go down..it's not like he even needs the money from the CD sales anyway (after all, Uncle tommy is always willing to help him out!)"
4,Memorizing,This new song that Michael Fredo wrote and probably his whole album is going to become a huge hit. I love the song he sung on the Tommy Hilfiger Jeans commercial. I think thast he's a great artist with a great song!
1,"it's like, okay and some junk!","Like, I saw that Tommy commercial and I instantly fell in love with his dreamy looks. and when I bot this cd, I no like. Listening to Michael Fredo made me get out my rusty razor, and cut my chest up. and i Dont think children should listen to him since he influences woman to cut themselve."
3,commercial,"I heard part of this song on a clothing commercial, Tommy Hilfiger, Tommy Jeans, whatever it may be, and the song was great! And I didn't even hear it all! I just heard ""This time around, No more tears"", and it was fab!"
5,Michael Fredo is the best!,"I was in the filming of the Tommmy Hilfiger Presents Michael Fredo. I was in the crowd as one of his screaming fans. He was really sweet and gave us some samples of his songs on the cd that wasn't released yet. ""This Time Around"" is the best song I have ever heard. I am a person who likes bands like Korn, Limp Bitzkit, Orgy and stuff like that but I really liked this cd"
5,Excellent! Excellent!! Excellent!!! You really MUST get it!,"This tune is so beautiful, so catchy. It's all you can ever want in a song - it's romantic and you can dance to it. When I heard it on TV, I literally went in search of it, and believe me, I usually don't do things like that. This is my first CD... Wow!"
1,what a joke,"Tommy Jeans has ruined any credibility this guy will ever have. The first few times I saw the commercial, I thought it was a joke...teenage girls (and BOYS!) screaming their heads off in the audience. I really enjoy watching it now."
3,"Good, but not Great","I saw the show when it opened. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed. I'm a large fan of Brian Darcy James and I think he's truly the highlight of this show and recording. JOhn Lithgow does a decent job, but its not his singing that made him good in his role. His acting in the role was what made him stand out, so unfortunatly you don't get the better bits of him on the recording. Jack Noseworthy has a nice voice and gives a good performance, but I don't really think his song I cannot Hear the city added much to the show. Another brilliant performance was Kelli O Hara. I'm surprised that so many people disliked her. I thought her voice was spectacular. Her tone is so unique and strong. Stacey Logan does a good job on the recording, however I don't really like her voice as she ends the song with the last couple of verses. The score itself isn't that bad. Some numbers are definitly better than others though. I would say give it a listen beforehand before buying it."
5,Totally underrated. An amazing work.,"Finally, a musical that integrates book with music. Smart, sophisticated and clearly over the heads of the critics. I saw this musical three times and audiences gave it a standing ovation every time. Like the film on which it is based, this musical will one day be regarded for the art it is."
2,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,"This was an awful musical. John Lithgow and Brian D'Arcy James are such great talents and they were wasted on this lousy show, it virtually failed in Chicago and should not have even been nominated, thank God for Thoroughly Modern Millie (ALLELUIAH!) The show never uses it's many talents and employs lack luster songs that could as Jean Valjean says in Les Miserables ""Come So far and travel for so long!"" I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the honest effort by Brian D'Arcy James and John Lithgow."
5,Pretty good,"I like this cast recording, but just after I heard the song more than twice. At first I didn't like it but then I realized that maybe John Lithgow doesn't have a ""Broadway singing voice"" but he is dominating the whole cd because of his charm and power. Brian D'Arcy James is terrific to just in Wild Party or Brownstone. Buy it you won't regret it."
1,So much potential...,"I can't believe how weak this score is! This show has a great story and book. if only it had a score to equal it. I'm baffled as to how it got to Broadway. Didn't they know at rehearsals this songs were not very good? i think this just points to the fact that fewer and fewer people know how to make a musical these days. Everyone on here has their favorites so i may as well list mine. ""For Susan"", sung by Lithgow and ""Don't look now"". Brian D'Arcy James has an excellent voice as does Ms. O'Hara. i wish that someone had given them something good to sing. I would hesitate to call the show jazzy. I think jazz fans will be dissapointed with this CD. it's more like psuedo-jazz A very, very forgettable score. What a waste!"
3,i wouldn't write home,"I wasn't expecting too much out of ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" given its general success and singing abilities of John Lithgow. Overall, I do enjoy the jazz feel of the score, and the cast boasts some amazing stars like Brian D'Arcy James, who gives an incredible performance. There are a few memorable songs, like ""Don't Know Where You Leave Off"", but the show is not as entertaining as some of the other hits of the year, like""Urinetown"", or the lesser-known ""The Last Five Years"". On the whole, I'd say only purchase this show if you are a huge fan of marvin hamlisch or if you're an intensely dedicated musical theatre collector."
4,,"Another triumphant record from the always-reliable Doro, this time providing us with even catchier songs and memorable ballads. If there's a thing about Doro, is that she knows what the ears find easy to digest, and she does this by creating easy-listening tunes with hard rock edge and occasional Metal moments. However, it is her voice that carries the soul of these songs, reaching for the aggressive angle when needed to and the more soulful, soothing side of her that adds emotional charisma to the compositions. Doro once again graces us with a record worthy of your purchase. With Doro, you know what you'll get and you know it will be a good thing."
3,Strong vocals over power the guitars . . . but still good.,"I just wanted to and a little to Murat Batmaz review of May 21, 2006. In that review he mentions that Doro's vocals are mixed much stronger than the guitars and other instruments. I have to agree with this. Althought Doro has great hard rock/metal vocals most metal heads like to here the ripping guitar riffs. The CD has the hard hitting, brain bending metal guitar riffs in it, however they are litterally mixed in the background. They are hard to hear and leave you trying to turn it up to hear the riffs. In my opinion the mixing on this CD really sucks. It really detracts from the music and listing to it. I would gladly pay for a rereleased copy of this CD with the guitars turned up. I think this could be a truely great CD if everything was mixed on a level field.So, while it is very good and Doro does a great job with the vocals and tracks, if you are expecting to hear the guitars with her vocals . . . you'll need a guitar hearing aid."
4,Very entertaining audio book,"This audio cassette version of Arthur and His Knights was really interesting. This book was about King Arthur and his adventures as a boy up until his death. Mr. Weiss also told about several of Arthur's knights of the round table, including the great Lancelot. I enjoyed listening to this book because of the narrator's expressive tones of voice which added to the climactic points in the story. All in all, it was a great listening experience."
5,Love Jim Weiss,We love to listen to audio books and dramatized stories in the car while we travel (which is a lot) My boys love to listen to Jim Weiss. He is so entertaining. We loved the stories on this disk and the whole family gets involved in them.
5,Wonderful!,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, this was the most played Christmas album of my childhood and it brings back great memories. It is a great balance of Christmas standards and newer songs. My husband makes fun of the arrangements (hey, it was made in 1982) and he even complains about the children's voices, but I tell him I don't want to hear his ""Scrooge"" talk! This is a great album from start to finish with a level of magic and sincerity seldom found in any kind of music. Thank you Oaks!"
5,Fantastic album I converted it to CD,We love this album. I converted it to CD on my computer and burned it for my wife. She has all the songs now on her computer as well so that she can play them anytime. tbird94509@yahoo.com
5,Contains The Best Christmas Song!!!,"I Love This CD. My Family has been listening to it for years. It contains my favorite Christmas Song, Thank God For Kids. I love the way the song touches my heart. Every time I hear it I think of Christmas past and Christmas yet to come. The other songs on the CD are really good to. They all are special and heart felt. One of my familes greatest Christmas traditions."
5,This album is a piece of my childhood...,"My mother use to play this album from October to February! We woke up to it every day and it blared on our farm! It was a must when opening presents and baking cookies for Christmas! I could sing the whold album for you by memory! :) Unfortunately, my parents experienced a house fire and it was a total loss. My mom is looking for this album again and we're having no luck! If you know where I can get it...please e-mail me at kelleb1@hotmail.com We hope to have it back by Christmas this year!!"
1,"interesting storing telling, poor survival information","This book has many far fetched tales and only a few good survival tips. The author talks alot about what seems to be a fictional character called stalking wolf and tries very hard to make him sound real. I liked a few of his shelter ideas and some of the traps, but there was nothing in this book i havent read before. If you want to read some interesting survival tales and dont care to learn survival skills, this will be a good book for you. my advice, look else where for a good survival handbook."
3,Not quite the only book you'll need for survival.,"Although I found this book to be informative, I felt it did not quite discuss all the points that a person should consider for survival. What I thought was missing from the book I have yet to find elsewhere. All I'm saying is that it is a good book, but I do not think it is the only book you should consider as far as wilderness survival is concerned."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is not a good wildernes survival book. It has nothing original and is peppered with the author's weirdo, new age mysticism. I have to admit that some of the techniques and skills are both accurate and useful, but you certainly don't need to find that information in this format. The U.S. Amry Survival Manual is a much better book, it's techniques have been tested and approved to meet service member's needs by professionals. I also understand that the ""SAS Survival Handbook"" is a good read for this subject."
2,Not The Best By Far On The Subject,"I would hate to rely on this information were I lost in the wilderness. There are much better buys on the subject available including ""The Boy Scout Handbook"" and ""The Boy Scout Field Book"". These two books will provide the basics necessary for survival. The material covered will give you topics for further study. Don't overlook the various Field Guides.It is not enough to read about this stuff, but take your books into the field and practice the skills until they become second nature."
2,"Good stories, meager knowledge","Tom Brown is a charismatic, inspiring story teller...one of the best. But if you are interested in learning these skills, you'd be much better off with McPherson's ""Naked into the Wilderness"" or ""Bushcraft"" by Mors Kochanski or Larry Dean Olsen's ""Outdoor Survival Skills"". For hide tanning (brain tanning) check out ""Deerskins into Buckskins"" by Matt Richards, tracking try ""Mammal Tracking in North America"" by James Halfpenny. Just about any edible plant guide will out do this book.Tom has inspired more people's interest in wilderness living/survival, and for that he deserves kudos. His most inspirational reading is ""The Tracker"". Get it and it will change your life. But if you want to actually learn the skills, you're better off elsewhere."
2,Not as good as its cracked up to be,"I've read all of Tom's books, and he is one awesome story-teller, but when it comes to teaching hands-on skills...well he's really just ok. I've been teaching primitive wilderness living skills for years, and there are quite a few topics in this book that his treatment and understanding of, are less than satisfactory.Get Tom's book The Tracker from amazon.com, to experience him at his best. For better survival skills info get Primitive Wilderness Living by John McPherson, or Outdoor Survival Skills by Larry Dean Olsen."
4,Practical,"Cool book. Very practical about how to survive in the wilds of North America with nothing but the clothes on your back. Maybe not even that!A little bit of ""be at one with nature"" stuff, but otherwise very informative. Good choice for a Boy Scout, or anyone wants to ""go lite"" when hiking and camping - using natural surroundings for cover, shelter, and food."
