2,"Love the books, hated this movie!!","Too much was different about this movie compared to the previous twilight movies. Parts were draged out that shouldnt have been, parts, the sets were different than in previous movies...itwas directed differently and in a way i didnt cafe for. Some scenes were twilight meets csi even!i didnt like that at all. Depressing and gory!Imust sayithink this film shoul win awards for themake up and special effects but the humor in the movie and everything else was too far off base. Thisdidnt live up tomy expectations in the least.iwas dissappointed by this film. Id have liked the style tohave been the same as it was in the previous movies. I canat least say the story stayed true to the books."
5,OMG I Want Part 2 Already,"Okay this has got to be the best movie in the twilight saga and it is far the best. The action is the greatest,It's great to see that Bella and Edward finally get married but theirs only one problem Bella gets pregnant and now she will have to make a life decision of what shes going to do because she has a lot to go through, Will she die or will she stay alive. This is the best movie from the twilight saga and it deserves five star's. I can't wait for Part 2 which will be coming out next November, But for now this is the best movie so far in the twilight saga =)"
4,Hard waiting for part 2,I've never read any of the books I've enjoyed the movies and although they make some extreme twist on the Vampire Mythos I don't mind this as it is a world of its own; the entire Vampire Mythos has been re-invented for this world with completely different explanations for things. I've really liked the way the characters have developed and am anxiously awaiting the next release.
4,The Twilight Saga-Breaking Dawn Part 1,"Had difficulty with the DVD in loading the movie. Finally was able to view, however cannot rewind any part of this DVD to re-view the scene.The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I (Two-Disc Special Edition).All the previews that were in the beginning are not now accessible for viewing. Just starts with the actual movie. The actual movie was really as I expected it to be in this series, especially the final scene. Am looking forward to part 2."
3,Somewhat like the book...,"Well it was ok...although I was actually dreading watching the movie. Things go super fast and stuff from the 3rd book is put into this movie, I'm guessing since the stuff was left out of the 3rd movie... But anyway the wedding takes place outside instead of inside, her friends are there even though they weren't in the book, and yeah she craves his attention just way too much for my taste, and honestly as far as the book and the movie goes, I just don't think anyone's first time is that amazing...no matter how much they want their partner...anyway I'm guessing that this is a ""must"" for any die hard fan or collector..."
5,GREAT MOVIES,LOVE IT. TELL EVERYONE TO SEE IT I WATCH.I WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGIGN THATS HOW MUCH I LOVE IT
5,arrived as promised and described,"I now have all but the last movie in the series, and love this movie series, so I'm not complaining at all."
4,Better than expected,"Because I read all of the books a few years back, I truly didn't know what to expect. Even when the first movie was released, I intentionally didn't go to see it. Now it's 2012 and I finally decided to watch the movies to determine whether they truly represented the books. I liked Part I of Breaking Dawn. I can't say that my expectations were high, but after watching it, I definitely wanted to see Breaking Dawn--Part II.If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you are a skeptic, like myself, you will be pleasantly surprised."
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to the movie, I have gradually been drawn into the Twilight appreciation society by fanatic wife and two children, but to be honest I was very disappointed, it did just did not get going, my wife who has read the Breaking Dawn book assures me the rest of the story will be much better, so I suppose I will look forward to that, but found Part 1 very ordinary......."
5,Different,"While the first 3 Movies stayed somewhat close to the books, ""Breaking Dawn-Part 1"", has a lot of thing's that are different in it... I know that they can't put EVERYTHING from the book into the movie, but there were a few time's that I found myself thinking 'Why did theydo this/that???', 'How did they get from there to here???'Even with those thing's, it's still a GREAT Movie... One that you diffently want to see... I just hope they release it on DVD soon... I also can't wait to see -Part 2-, I think it's going to be sometime in July or around then..."
3,wellllll,"I am not a fan of the book series, and that being said I think that affects watching the movies. I for one have no idea what is going on, I know they must have left a lot out of the movie that was in the book. My daughter on the other hand really liked the move, she has read all the books. I feel that the acting was a little better in this movie than the others, but this movie felt more like a stepping stone to their (Bella and Edwards) next life together or what ever you call it. I am getting tired of the werewolf/vampire fighting/treaty crap. I really just think they should write out the werewolves, just keep Jacob around as the babies godfather (or whatever you would call it). Well, go see it if you must, I would have waited till the DVD but I ended up being my daughters default date for the movie, what's a mom to do?"
1,Stupid as ever,"Unfortunately the options of ""no stars"" is not in existence. This crap does not even deserve the one star. If you thought the books were bad, you were dead wrong. Horrible acting, disgusting plot line and forced action (which doesn't exist really)."
3,Meh blended into the one before it too much,"I guess that is part of the point of a 4 part saga but honestly to me it just seemed very repetitive and they totally exhausted the heck out of the I love this boy and that boy and oh look at my raw immature female emotions as I grow and display the needless complexity of blah, Blah , Blah add infinitum etc... etc.. Oh look a wedding and a dreadful pregnancy. Sorry I liked the first one for the novel approach to the subject matter, the second movie was a nice follow up with more character development but this one No Thanks. This I am certain appeals to a population segment I just do not happen to be a part of the design on a dime bridezilla crowd so this is where I steppes off of the bus.Am I going to see the last one? I'm Married, NUFF Said...."
4,Awesome,It was good. Not a lot of action but enjoyable. I would rent another movie from this service. Fast and easy and reasonable!!
1,Not same as picture,This is NOT what you will get when your order comes in. It is just a regular 2 disc special edition. Not the white box made to like like Bella's dress. Not collectors edition at all.
4,Good but kind of dragged on a bit,"I liked this movie, but it dragged on a bit more than I would have liked. I love the series, but it seems this movie could have been combined with the second one rather than stretch it out into two movies."
1,Waste of time,"The story line isn't the greatest, and the acting just sucks. No one can take Bella seriously with her three facial expressions the entire movie"
5,The next addition to our collection...,My now 13 year old daughter loves it and it was just what she wanted to make her collection as complete as possible.
3,the reason why.,I didn't know that ordering a DVD from the UK that I wouldn't be able to play it on my DVd player I am sure the movie is good but since I couldn't watch it I just gve it an ok. of coarse the person I ordered it from is refunding me my money though amazon and I have sent the DVD back
2,Not a great movie,"I was really disappointed in this latest edition to this series. It was just a so, so movie and at times actually seemed kind of boring. I have all the previous movies and liked each one of them, but this one is bad. Because of this movie, I don't think that I would waste my money to purchase the next part when it comes out. Save yourself some money on this and don't buy. I highly DO NOT recommend this one."
2,Disappointing,The others were so good but this movie was quite disappointing. It seemed to draw out with no real purpose other than the wedding. Certain aspects of the movie seemed cheesy like the wolves talking. In my oppinion it just didn't seem well done.
2,Don't bother,"I started watching Twilight because of my gf, I thought they're ""OK"", but this one is horrible. The whole baby thing was weird.And I noticed in so many scenes where no one was talking! Just pure silence!! o.OI usually like this kind of movies, about Vampires and all that.. So I started watching Vampire Diaries, it's waaaay better! From Acting/Actors, to music, to quality! Anyway, this is a Twilight review, and here it is."
1,Good to Laugh At,Only bought this to watch and laugh. The acting/writing is absolutely horrible and pretty much nothing happens so clearly they only split it into two movies for the money.
2,Too old for teen angst movies,"I'm sorry but I just don't find myself enjoying teen angst movies and this movie is just overloaded with ""angstiness""! I enjoyed the special effects and the action but this movie was just outright depressing. I couldn't help but wonder if the actors are wondering ""When does this end...I need to move on"". If you're home on a Friday night and want to know what happens with the rest of this saga, then watch it but don't expect to walk away ""satisfied"". I plan on watching the last movie just to find out the answer to the following question ""What the hell did the big kahunas see in Bella?"""
4,good story line,"A very tasty story about love and death dancing with wolves, mixing happiness and sadness, despair and hope - and sex and blood!,"
4,Quick and easy review,"Quick and easy review: not to bad of a movie, the quality is good for a DVD.Do not pay more than $10 for this."
5,movie,This is a part of the same movies my son wanted. Now all he needs is breaking dawn 2 he can't wait for it.Thank you so much.
4,Good movie,I feel like I can only give this 4 stars because of Kristen Stewarts poor acting skills. The product itself is great and I have liked the movies. Any Twilight fan would be glad to have this movie as part of their collection.
3,I'm probably not the best person to rate this movie,"This movie was not made for my demographic, it's more for teens and folks in their 20s. And I am not big on the whole romance thing. I do love vampire movies however. The movie did not have a lot of fighting scenes compared to the previous twilight movies. It more of less focused on the relationship between the two main characters and how when a vampire and a human do the wild thing, things can go badly.With that said, for 1.99 it's worth a watch."
5,Loved it!!!,This was gift to my daughter for Christmas. She was so excited to have received it. She is a huge Twilight fan. She loved it!!!
5,loved it,I am fan. Love Vampire movies anyway. creating a love story of such between a vampire and human and then to produce a child was great. again I loved it.
4,Entertaining,I think each movie has gotten better. Not that that was hard. My teenage daughter loves them. We have to complete the series.
5,Not like the book but still loved it!,"I'm old enough to be all the actors mother, but still find the whole Twilight Saga charming. The acting is very good and Rob Pattenson is his usual sexy self, this is the first time he has to struggle at something without Bella at his side, but all works out well. If you love the other movies, you'll love this one too. The only thing was there were only a couple bruises, what's the big deal? For him to be so upset they could've marked her up a little more. The sex scenes were sweet and tastefully done, love it when he moans! But why did the other vampires stop hunting when she comes home pregnant? Just remember its a modern fairy tale and go with the flow and you'll enjoy this movie too."
5,Satisfied,My collection is almost complete. It was very hard finding the right dvd version that is similar to borders' twilight and new moon. It is what I thought it was. And what I wanted.
3,I only watched the sex scene.,"I watched the first Twilight and it was so terrible, I couldn't bring myself to watch the next movies. But, you know, I wanted some ""closure."" I couldn't find the sex scene for the life of me on YouTube or anywhere else, which is stupid, because you know that s*** would be one of the top-watched vids on the internet, more than cats or something. And, when I finally bought the d*** thing just to see those two anemic lovers finally get what they've been making constipated faces about for the entire series (remember, I didn't see the next one) THEY DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING. Figures.But then I fast-forwarded to the end, and seeing her all sick and preggers was kind of funny. So, three stars."
3,not as good as the first three,"Breaking Dawn Part One is the movie of the first half of the book of the same title in the Twilight Saga series by Stephenie Meyer. Bella has finally agreed to marry Edward and he's finally agreed to turn her into a vampire. She obviously has rocks in her head. Beautiful wedding orchestrated by the lovely Alice. Edward with a bit more colour, although not in all scenes: sometimes he looked human, sometimes hit with the excess white makeup. He actually smiles a few times. Then the super-speed pregnancy, with Bella looking like a cancer patient by the end. Baby Renesmee born, Jacob imprinted, Bella converted on point of death, looking like death and then magically looking beautiful again. Far too many song interludes. Jacob should lose the facial hair."
4,Good stuff,"We ""Twihards"" just have more to love! The story just continues to get better and better. I highly recommend it!"
5,Great Movie,"Love this movie. My daughter got me watching them and I was hooked. Even if you didn't read the books, you can still enjoy the movies."
4,Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 doesn't disappoint,The best of the Twilight movies so far. And I'm hearing the finale now out in theaters is worth the wait. Team Paul and Jasper here.
5,Excellent,"Loved this movie!! The Twilight movies just progressively get better, and I live having the double DVD with all the special features!"
3,Better than the previous movies,The acting is getting better. Not as much teen angst as the last few movies. I was actually able to enjoy the story line. I'm looking forward to part 2.
3,Book is soooo much better,"It's hard to make a movie as good as the book, but this one was the worst one so far."
1,Terrible!,"Boring, stupid, no action. Only problem is that you have to see this movie in order to understand Part 2."
3,Slow and lame,"Not the most exciting film, and not the best acting... but fans of the book will still appreciate the film for what it is worth. The 1st half of the movie is Edward and Bella making out, and the movie slowly picks up about an hour into it when Bella's baby and her fate comes into play."
1,So unbelievably bad,"I was shocked by how the tone in this installment had shifted. It is almost as if the director was out to make fun of the film he was creating. The wedding toasts, really? Gah! Embarrassing to watch. The dialog was stilted and the acting was soap opera'ish'. Poor Taylor Lauten seems to have been given the worst direction. What happened to the breath taking scenery? Even the scenes shot on the honeymoon were nothing special. Parts of the film looked like a television series while others, most notably Edward and Bella leaving in the Volvo for the honeymoon, looked like a car commercial. I really hope the second installment is better but if shot the same time as the first, there is little hope for improvement. What a shame. This whole series could have been something spectacular if one great director had stepped up to helm all of the installments, like Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings films."
5,Forever is Only The Beginning,"This was my favorite Twilight movie so far. I've got to say, I was a little nervous about this one. With a wedding, honeymoon, and a baby, I didn't think they would be able to fit all of that in a two hour movie. I am completely Team Jacob(Taylor Lautner) but, I also found myself liking Edward (Robert Patterson)in this one. I always thought he was cold-hearted. He showed emotion and he had a personally in this movie. I never saw that before. He was also a good husband. Not to big on having a baby, but he had good reasons. He came around in the end when he knew the baby wasn't a demon, and that's all that matters. It is rated PG13 and comes with Special Features."
2,oooops,"I had waited to see this movie, had a little time, got all ready to watch, and it would not download. Tried several times-no luck. Still waiting to see movie."
2,Disappointing...,"I should have listened to all of those who read the book and said how disappointed and pissed they were and should've never watched the movie. Despite of all the warnings, I still went ahead and watched it, I guess because of all the anticipation. Let me start by saying, Breaking Dawn was a disappointment in so many levels. The reason I fell in love with the series was because it was so romantic and magical...there was not much of that in Breaking Dawn.I'm just pissed with how much Edward and Bella changed, the wedding, the honeymoon, the pregnancy (according to Meyer this could not happen). Thanks Stephanie Meyer for killing all my imagined magic this Sage might once held for me...The baby's name: Renesmee!! And then Jacob imprinting on her. I felt sick.I have never been so let down by a movie. This was a total betrayal of the series."
3,"""Twilight"" getting worse not better",This has to be the worst of the Twilight movies so far. Maybe it's b/c Stephanie Meyer produced it? Just hope they don't screw up the 2nd installation b/c that's the best part of the book.
5,Ah-Mazing,"This movie is one of the best I have seen! When I went to the theater I was so excited. When I came out I was looking through every store to pre-order it. I would suggest this movie if you like Romance and Drama, and Baby Renesme. It was Ah-Mazing!!!!"
2,Breaking Dawn,"I was not impressed with this installment, and the ending was just blah!! they could have made this more exciting. I bought the movie and I'm going to return it and buy it used. the wedding scene was nice, but the movie went downhill after that, I was really looking forward to the scene with the Volturi and it was not in the movie!!. I hope the next saga is much better than this crap they churned out."
3,Poor Script.,"This is a great franchise and has enthusiasm of youthful cast and author. If you have not read the books, you are missing extremely well written books.Have read these books at least 7 times and am about to go back to the fourth book and read it again. The script seems to deviate often from the book and the deviations were not an improvement to the storyline.The actors did their part, the camera people did an excellent job, direction was good and all of the special effects were excellent. Was surprised to see how much the actors had matured and notable changes in physical appearance.Since this was produced by Ms. Meyers, am surprised the script was so disjointed and produced poor results portraying an excellent book.We will get all of the movies because we like the books so much and appreciate Ms. Meyers work authoring this excellent series."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"This movie is absolutely terrible. The worst one they have made so far. ***Spoiler Alert*** The wedding scene is brutal, the honeymoon scene is weird, the birth scene is grotesque, and the werewolf council is laughable. Not that this movie storyline is believable, but getting lost in this story is not even an option (and I think it was in the previous movies). They have a chance for redemption in Part II, lets see if it comes to be."
1,Worst Movie I've ever seen,"I enjoyed the book and I really tried to like this film, but I really think this was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was slow and choppy. The director for this installment is not a great storyteller. The low point was the talking wolves, and the high point was when the credits rolled because the film was done."
2,Most boring twilight,Usually I am entertained by these movies but I just wanted to fall asleep. Not a very meaty story line.
5,Great first part to the final movie!,I've never read the books so I wasn't a big fan going into Twilight but the movie did a great job of engaging you and anxious to see Part 2. Great bonus features too on the making of the movie. I would recommend buying it.
5,Love it,Love Twilight. Any gift I receive that is Twilight related is a winner in my book. Huge Fan! ! !
3,Drag it out!!!!,I have come to the conclusion that the books are much better than the movies. But I didn't think that the books were that good.
3,If your kid likes it - watch it so you can discuss with them,"Bella drives me friggin nuts with her lack of enthusiasm - could have had a mannequin play the part. But that isn't what my review is about. There are many scenes in the movie that a parent could (and should in my opinion) discuss with their child (presuming they are old enough to understand). Obsession, lack of respect for parents (father mostly), running away, lies, taking extreme chances to learn if ""he"" loves me (her cliff jumping to the water), being possessiveness of another person, I could go on and on. These all present wonderful opportunities to openly discuss with your son/daughter about what they are watching and (unfortunately) learning in the movie - good discussions about how incorrect the scenes are and why. Whether the children are male/female doesn't matter as each should not behave the way these characters do. Why 3 stars - well the movie isn't a complete disaster, I do love the scenery. Middleborough, MD"
4,good movie,First time streaming from amazon and it was a good experience not to mention the movie was pretty good. Had to watch it before seeing part 2.
5,Awesome,Awesome movie and at a great price of only .99. Thank you for the opportunity to rent the movie. now i am caught up on the series.
4,finally watched it,"my son wants me to go see part 2 so I finally rented part 1, still don't see why she chose the vampire over the hunky werewolf :) great rental price. Love my Prime."
4,vampire blood,I saw the first movie I through it was okay then when I saw Taylor Lautner took off his shirt I was hook on it for sure now I'm really a fan of twilight I'm never going to get bored of it ever!!!
3,Are we there yet ?,"Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 1 is no doubt going to win Best Movie at the MTV Movie Awards but it's nothing too special. For one, cutting the last book down to 2 parts worked much better for Harry Potter since at least something happens in the first half of Deathly Hallows and there's action. Breaking Dawn is engaging in the second half of the book mostly. There's romance and drama in the first half but that's about it, just making the last one movie would have been better."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G!,"I only went to see the movie to make fun of it later. Good Lord, if not for the pervy old ladies sitting behind me doing their own Mystery Science Theatre 300, I woud have slept through it. Bella was not the least bit happy on her wedding day. I thought she was supposed to be over-the-moonin ove with Edward. Then, an eternity of pointless filler later, Jacob had become a pedophile. Why did his pack kill him for that and why didn't Bella or Edward do something about it other than being proud? I have to admit watching Bella get slowly killed was the only interesting thing. What is it with Stephanie Meyers and ruin great buid up with stupid little things such as the ""imprinting""? Would it have been so bad for a bloody battle scene or hey maybe some sexual tension between the stars? Why is gorey violence okay but not pg-13 sensuality?"
1,-10 stars,a bent and twisted book put to film. rotten acting and screenplay. meyers world is a joke. the only reason this movie made money is because the education system has gone down the toilet and people cant read anything complex.
2,Not nearly as good as the previous movies,I simply thought it was lacking in many ways. The whole movie was like watching a long ending and nothing more than that.I am glad I only paid two bucks to watch it. Now not interested in watching the second part.
4,Started out slow,"So I've really enjoyed all the books & the movies up til this one. The first half of this movie was a bit boring. But since I've invested so much time with the series & the prior movies I wasn't going to give up. I continued to watch & it did eventually pick up speed. CANNOT wait for part 2.Sidenote: If you haven't read any of the books or watched any of the earlier movies, you would probably be bored out of your skull."
3,Kid liked it but adults were bored,Teens/kids movie for sure. We the adults were pretty bored with boring dialogues and story lines. It was long and we were waiting and hoping for some interesting twists or fabulous action scenes but it never happened.
1,Unskeakably Bad Movie,"I watched the first three and each declined in quality as they came out. The actors have aged quite a bit and look very different now and that does not help the horrible script or the silly performances. I mean, the joke is over and no adult could possibly find any reason to watch the next one. UGH!"
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with the prop flowers. I had expected actual flowers preserved inside an acrylic block. What I got was a cheap plastic flower that can be purchased at any Michael's Crafts sandwiched between two sheets of plastic. It is completely tacky looking. No wonder they don't show a picture of this; I would never have spent the extra money had I known it would be so tacky. Way to disappoint and gouge money from the fans, Summit!"
1,What a waste of money,"I got the box today, and yes I do understand that you don't get a real flower in the box, but I expected at least a flower that looks at least a little bit like the flower on the picture. My flower is absolutely not anything like it. Not even remotely. Really sad that I spend money on this.If you want Breaking Dawn, just buy the regular dvd/blu ray or the other special edition. Stay far away from this one!"
2,So sad about this,"I am a big fan of the Twilight series love the actors, have read the books more than once, own all 3 previous movies and the music as well! I find them to be all have great qualities in different ways if you expect from them what they are - fun, campy and fantasy, however, I could not have been more dissapointed in the Breaking Dawn movie - lacking in romance, the long awaited sex scene was a yawn, so much of the book was just missing and it was so disjointed it left me with an empty feeling! Can we have a do-over?????"
1,PATHETIC,"I love True Blood, Vampire Diaries, and many other vampire movies and series, but for the life of me I cannot like this movie. It's pathetic. The acting is at most, marginal, but the wolf isn't that bad. At least he's trying. But the two main characters are so stilted, wooden, and bland, it kills the movie. Save your money and just read the book."
4,Improving with each movie,"I only started watching these movies because I read the book series and loved them!The acting is not all that great in Twilight...but as each movie comes out, the actors seem to get a little better.If you read the books, it is worth watchign the movies just for entertainment. Don't be expected to be blown away by stellar performances or academy award nominations, though."
4,Breaking Dawn Part 1 DVD,"I love the collectible fabric wedding poster. It is big and lovely. I was expecting the DVD cover to be like the one we see in the picture. But in reality the wedding dress edition is just a box and inside its the normal breaking dawn DVD with the fabric poster of Edward and Bella. So I was disappointed, i really wanted the DVD case to be the wedding dress. Overall love the movie, the poster, just wish the Dvd case was like the box in came in."
3,3rd Favorite In The Movie Series,"I'm a grown man who enjoys Twilight . . . but I did not enjoy this film. Much of the movie I was waiting for the plot to start after an extra long wedding and honeymoon scene, but it never did. Then it took great liberties and departed from the book. When it finally got interesting the movie ended abruptly.Hopefully the second film will be more interesting."
3,TTSBD,It is what I expected. Just want to finish the series of movies to see how the story ends. I did not read the books.
5,Great,My daughters are hooked on the twilight series and love this DVD. It is awesome and in great codition. Thanks
3,Gift for a Twilight fan,I bought it as a gift for my friend. It is one of her favorite movie series. It is a great film for any twilight fan.
4,Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1,Not quite as good as the first three movies! It still was wotrh watching as my wife and I have watched the others at least six times each.
1,Vampires?,Best two hour nap of my life. I am impressed that someone was so able to channel the psyche of 14 year old kids into book and film format. Give me back my vampires!! The OC can't have them.
5,Movie,Excellent. I have the complete series and this is an excellent movie. I thought it was neat it was filmed in Washington.
2,Why can't I look away! That's the question with this one.,The acting is so bad and the pathetic heroine (if that's what she could be called) really beg the question. Why are these so popular? Belle's character is so emotionally weak and clinging it is really sick. What does this movie say to young women? Nothing of value as far as I can see.
1,Oh my eyes...,"witness such a tragedy!Saddens me to see such monstrosities released on DVD!Oh but it horrifies me to see it on Blu-ray!To see Bella's stone face in HD is like running into a tree!To see Edward's sparkling chest truly scrambles one's brain into a mess!Such overrated trash is not meant to be seen, but quality no longer needs to beam. How easily one can see the stitches on the seams. It seems that good movies in 2012 are naught but a dream!"
3,Part 1,Not impressed. The movie was slow with little action. If it was a set up for the Part 2 installment then I was glad I did not see it when it first came out. It did make me want to see part 2 now.
3,hmm ok i guess,"Kind of what I predicted, standard fare for this series. Nothing earth shattering but still a fun ride. I am interested to see how part 2 turns out, so I guess they did at least hook me there."
5,The Best One!!!!,"By far this was the best Twilight movie. I loved it! I saw it twice. It was funny, sad and exciting. I believe it was true to the book. I would even have to go as far as to say it was better than the book. I thought the sex scene would be horrible because it was PG-13 ( and I am 34) but they did a great job at capturing what needed to be captured and did it in a tasteful way. Pattinson is adorable! Stewart did an outstanding job! I cant wait to get my DVD copy!"
4,Good Price,I purchased this movie when it was on sale. I had no issues with the Blu Ray. It was a good buy.
1,Completely Brain Dead,Worst film I have seen in a long time.It should have a warning that it only suitable for children under 12.It was completely brain dead entertainment for anyone over that age.
5,Completing my collection,I bought this one to help complete my collection and to watch all of them prior to the release of the last movie in theatres. Love this series.
5,OMG Cannott wait!! :),"I cannot wait for this to come out. I have all of the other movies and books. Also went to see them all in theaters. My fav movie was the first Twilight, but this one is close second. I don't see how their gonnna fit the rest of Breaking Dawn into one movie. But I can't wait to see!"
1,Perfect movie for a new MST3K,"My pals & I went to see this while completely drunk. It was the best time I've had at the movies in ages. I laughed- no exaggeration- from the opening credits to the end. Not sure I could sit through it sober, but if you're looking for a movie to rip on a la Mystery Science Theatre 3000 you can't do any better. The wooden acting, absurd dialogue and crawling pace of the movie make for the perfect target."
5,Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn,"Saw the movie in the theater, but wanted the DVD to watch from time to time. Wife loves the music and got me hooked."
3,Another Twilight winner,I have followed the Twilight movies for years. I am a big fan of the love story between Bella and Edward. Part one left me wanting more. I cannot wait to see the final chapter.
3,"A bit of a let down, but expect the next movie to be better.","Watched with my 11 yo DD, who found the sex scenes exhausting/boring and the fight scenes too dark to see & therefore lacking. Watching the special feature DVD provided an insight in the Director's interpretation of the story. I thought there were key points that were pivotal that should have been further developed. This part of the story turns much of the plot & should have been given more care...For example, the changes in the werewolf dynamics and the imprinting scene. Make sure to check out the teaser at the end of the credits of the movie...I think the last movie shows great promise."
1,Moronic!,"The movie and the story are so horrible that I have to write this. But first, a question...doesn't Bella come across as a moronic teenager? Has no ambition, is superbly whinnying, and not to mention...extremely selfish. It is wrong to blame Bella though; the character was created by an untalented author. The story has no substance or imagination, and is more or less centered on impatient, aimless and cranky teenagers. It is an attempted love story, which wasn't convincing by any standards. I read the first novel and couldn't bring myself to read the others. Movies were worst. And this latest installment is an atrocity. There is nothing epic about this series; it is dead as a rock (or Edward). It could have been completed in 30 minutes. Sheer dumbness!"
2,If you gave it five stars there is no way you read the book!,If you gave this movie five stars then I can't imagine you read the book. The books are always a million times better than the movies. I think it would be worth it to have five parts to this movie just so it could be more accurate to the book. Of course some hate he books but I really enjoyed reading them. If you hate the books then you are just a Twilight hater so this review does apply to you at all. If you really enjoyed the movie then I beg you to read the book because you are really missing out. I loved the series of books much more than the movies.
5,LOVE IT!!!,I'm a major Twilight fan and LOVED Breaking Dawn Part one in theaters. I pre-ordered my dvd as soon as Amazon listed it online. I'm anxiously awaiting its arrival.
5,DIE HARD TWIHARD,THERE ISNIT MUCH TO SAY OTHER THAN I AM A TRUE TWIHARD FAN. THE MOVIES HAVE NOT DISAPPOINTED ME. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,BOOOOOOORRING! OMG so boring!,"I hate twighlight the movies, the books, but as far as all media is concerned this is definitely the most BOOORING movie in the series. 2 hours of wedding scenes and the two characters making kissy face or having a measuring contest among the vampire and chihuahua dude. TERRIBLE MOVIE"
1,damaged goods,I returned this item because it was damaged. I can not rate an item that was returned to you with out me being able to see it.
1,Maudlin muck,"Boring, stupid, and cringeworthy. I gave the saga a chance after the decent first movie but it has gotten worse with each episode. Embarrassed that I went this far into the series. Won't bother with the last. Beyond fantasy...just crap of the lowest order story wise and disappointing effects for the resources devoted to it."
5,Brilliantly done.,Well acted; scenery amazing. Great special effects. Followed book very well. Well worth seeing again! An absolute must for Twilight fans of all ages.
2,leaden angst wrapped in fur and amber contact lenses,"As a lonely middle aged man with no social life, when I sit down to watch a sexy vampire flick with a glass of chardonnay, a plate of low-sodium fat-free water crackers, and two boxes of moisturizing tissues, I expect more than leaden angst wrapped in fur and amber contact lenses. Perhaps this should be renamed to Twilight: Breaking Hymn (did I spell that correctly? *cough*), since it was a naughty song of love. The moon through yonder window did break, and its light in and out of the window did shine, all night long, until the bird cried out in the morning, ""coo! coo!"" And if you think that's hot, then you'll thrill to the glacial pacing of this epic nuptial that remains frozen in time, like Edward's icy and tumescent love for Bella."
4,Recommend,"It's awesome that you can download and watch instantly. Good movie, definitely recommend it. Ready for Breaking Dawn part 2 to come out March 2nd."
1,DUMB MOVIE !,This movie is crap! Do not buy ! complete waste of time.. Waste of money ... that all i have to say !
3,Pregnancy,"I have never read the book, but all I got out of thise movie was that it was about a pregnancy. This shouldn't have even been a whole movie. Still the scenes where there was actually something happening, it was good."
5,Super Movie!,"This movie is as good as the past movies. I am looking forward to the next. The download was super fast too. I was so nice to be able to watch a movie on my Kindle Fire in the car, it made a long trip much better."
3,watched it for my wife,"My wife likes the Twilight movies, so I've sat through them with her. I'm more of an old school vampire fan, but I found myself enjoying parts of it."
3,"I like the idea of ""cloud"" DVDs","But in practice, it still needs a bit of work. There just doesn't seem to be enough bandwidth (and I have a fast broadband internet connection) to have a smooth even play throughout the movie - there are still areas when it has to pause and then pick back up. There's also one or two scenes that seem so dark I cannot make out what's going on, regardless of the platform (computer or TV). But it's nice just be able to decide, ""I'd like to watch a movie"", and shaZaam, there you go!"
1,Wife made me buy this ... I'm ready to slit my wrist,"Please stop making these movies so us poor men don't have to suffer anymore. Or, add some Nazis to it for interest."
3,Kinda slow...,Lots of pale people and slow moving. A solid meh in the twilight saga. Probably won't bother with part 2.
2,It's Sappy,"My wife loves these kind of movie. I don't. She watched the whole thing, but after I started streaming the movie and went back into the living room to watch it with her, she looked at me and said, ""It's sappy. I went into the office and worked on my taxes."
4,Entertaining!,I read the books and love the Twilight series. Each movie gets better. I'm still TEAM JACOB. Bella is still insufferable.
4,Best One,"I've been a follower of the Twilight saga (books and film), and I believe this to be the best of the movies."
4,Twilight Fan,I thought it was in the limited edition caseI am still happy with my order. I will order again
5,Twilight series,"I was originally introduced to the Twilight Saga series by a girlfriend, who finally convinced me to watch the first Twilight with her. I entered into the movie with a preconceived bias that the series was a teenybopper thing, but changed my mind during the viewing. Plot development was good, the setting (Pacific Northwest) was very suitable, and the characters were endearing in their own weird way. I am now a fan, and can't wait for the release of Breaking Dawn pt. 2. Good seres, I recommend it."
4,Love the Saga,Love the SeriesI love the whole Twillight Saga Series and can't wait to see the Breaking Dawn Part two.
3,Kinda bad quality,"The movie skipped, words didn't match the mouths, and some parts were really blurry,I would recommend the movie to everyone if quality was better"
3,Don't you want to slap the casting director at Summit who cast Stewart in the original film?,"Interesting film, unfortunately a lot of it focused on Stewart's vacuous stare and wooden acting. Can she do a film without that blank, open-mouthed face? Please let her career be over. Was hoping it would be better than it was, she just keeps getting worse. Thought it would have the evil vampires in it, they made it fun."
3,Breaking Dawn- Part I,This video was in perfect condition when I received it. After several uses though the special features disk stopped working.
5,Bella and Edward,Awesome movie; must own all series. My next purchase will be the entire book collection. I am anxious to see what happens next.
4,Still team Jacob,The movie was good. My only complaint was that during the night scenes it was so dark I couldn't see any action only hear the wolf calls and voices.
3,No deleted scenes????,"It took 2 weeks to arrive...I was about to go purchase it at the store, I think the final chapter of this saga will be purchased at Target... Very disappointed... The movie of course is great, once a week sometimes twice I watch all my Twilight movies."
1,Hilarious Movie,"Watch this movie, just for the sheer comedic value, and the sheer absurdity.I rented it for 4.00. and got my money's worth.Wait, this movie was supposed to be a serious romance?"
2,The WORST!!!,Easily the worst movie I've seen since the last Twilight. A total waste of 2 hours. It ought to be legal to throw bombs on the set of the next one!
5,Bella,The product got here quickly and in good shape and it is a great movie from a great book. This was the best movie so far out of the series.
3,Could have been better,"I rented this movie last night. This movie should have had more action and fight scenes in it. The movie portrayed Bella as this innocent victim in the marriage. When she knew what she was marrying into. Oh I am pregnant, and the baby is killing me and breaking my bones. Well thugh. I know, it's just a movie. So many young women think marriage is apples and icecream. That is how this movie portrayed Bella. What I didn't like about this movie was about the talking. The honeymoon scenes were romantic. But, certain parts of the movie were just boring. Up until the end. When Bella dies and turns into a vampire. Lets hope the next Twilghlight movie. That she isn't so victim like anymore. Her little girl victim character started to get on my nerves."
4,Loud but does the job - 2 major concerns if using with AV equipment,"excellent air mover for this size. Used for cooling entertainment center electronic components, including 46"" Sony Bravia TV, Yamaha YSP4000 surround sound bar, lighting, and dvd player.I had to also purchase an adapter to make the unit run on 120V ac power (regular outlet) but it works as described. There are 2 negatives to consider if purchasing for AV equipment:1) The humming of the fan blades is loud when listening to the TV at any average volume level. Though I searched for and found only this unit is quieter than most - wow, what do the other fans sound like?!2) The temperature gage is useless since the unit is made to turn on around 70 degrees. It didn't occur to me until after I installed it that I keep the room temperature anywhere from 70-74F in the winter, and 78-82F in the summer!"
1,The noisy fan,Do not buy this fan. That's the best advice I can give you.- It's noisy and the speed cannot be changed- The screws supplied do not 'in any way' fit- Onboard sensor connector does not work.I used this for 24 hours before the noise drove me to disconnect it.
1,Scratchy CD,This CD was not playing in my computer a CD player and in my car. It is a bad company to get to me.
1,Not suitable for an introduction to The Enlightenment,"The previous reviews do not warn the potential reader that this is an ""insider's"" book. It may be suitable for those well-versed in philosophy but is a waste of time and money for anyone outside of the field of philosophy. It never gets around to offering a cogent review of the nature of enlightenment philosophy. I was disappointed because I had read that the leading figures in the American Revolution were well-versed in this subject."
5,I shared his pain....,"This book is excellent and I recommend it as a MUST read for anyone considering doing any business in Moscow and to a lesser extent other cities of Russia. I lived there for two years and had my own fair share of bizarre business experiences and even a dose of ""Moscow Madness""...don't ask! This book is full of well told true episodes of how Russia was in the 90's."
2,LOWBROW!,"Reading this book I was embarrased to be from the same country as amatuer businessman Rick Grajirena. What an ethnocentric view of doing business oversees, more or less Russia. This book is full of petty, whiney complaints of how Russians do not smile readily or greet you upon entering shops. This has always been the case so stop crying like a spoiled American about it OK? Not everyone is ready to saved by the Americans. Mr Gradirena proves that he was not ready to do business with the new Russia and had no tolerance for an emerging economy"
4,OK,"I left wanting more from this film, and give it ""4"" stars, but just OK and won't go any higher than that!"
3,Where's Kyle?,"If you grew up with all the nardcore bands watch it with this CD. Kyle Toucher is nowhere to be found. These new reworkings of classic Dr. Know songs isn't too bad but it can't compare to the originals. I was a excited to see this since all my Dr. Know is on vinyl. At first I was disappointed that Kyle wasn't singing. It finally grew on me. If this is from the era of punk you grew up with, you might be upset. If you grew up with Blink 182, this is at least one of the CD's you need in your collection."
1,What the hell is this?,"If you are looking for Dr. Know. Look some place else. If this is Kyle singing then he must be fat and out of practice. I seen Dr. Know live in 87. And this does not compare at all. Surf the net for the real songs, you'll be happy that you did."
2,It's Just Not The Same,"I bought this cd because I figured it would be a fresh take on some old favoirites. Well, I'd like to say I loved it, but I didnt. This cd just comes off as flat and lifeless. Where as the original songs, the Kyle Toucher on vocals versions, had a certain edge, the remakes make great material sound very mediocre. For those of you first discovering Dr. Know,l this may be the greatest cd in the world...the material is that good-but, if you really want to experience Dr. Know, buy their Best of CD that was released on Mystic Records. This is the best version of Dr. Know. Hope this helps!"
3,Reviewing a reviewer,"Before people come on here and voice their opinions, I wish they would get their facts straight. Brandon Cruz WAS the origional singer for Dr. Know and those were his songs with the exception of 5 tracks, he wrote and origionally sang. Reguardless of your respect for Mr.Cruz, please give him his due. Kyle Toucher joined later on which re-defined Dr.Knows macabre sound and this is probably why most Dr. Know fans only know Kyle Toucher. I just wanted to set the record straight for a person with the audacity to criticize something he or she has limited facts on. I hope somebody gets to read this because Brandon Cruz deserves this."
1,Stop trying so hard,"Brandon Cruz is trying to recapture something he never had. His credibility as an artist. Why else would he redo the songs written by Kyle instead of writing his own? Kyle toucher was the backbone of Dr. Know! I am utterly amazed at how Brandon can take truly amazing songs and butcher them beyond recognition.I recommend ""The Best of Dr. Know"" if you want to hear these songs as they were intended."
2,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"AFTER LISTLENING TO THIS CD A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WATCHING DR. KNOW PLAY WITH BRANDON CRUZ I THINK THAT THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A DR. KNOW FAN AND DONT OWN THIS CD THEN YOU SHOULD SLAP YOUSELF RIGHT NOW.IT DOESNT MATTER IF ITS NOT KYLE TOUCHER ITS STILL DR. KNOW AND THEY KICK ASS AND BRANDON CRUZ IS A COOL GUY.ALSO THE METAL STUFF THAT KYLE DID KICKS ASS TOO, IF YOU ARE A FAN THEN YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT OUT TOO."
1,I can't get it to work!,When I first loaded it it worked great. Then kept getting errors. Then didn't work at all. I tried deleting it and putting it back in my computer but had error and would not let me. emailed them but no response.
1,Terrible Customer Service/Tech Support,"I purchased this software over a month ago. When I did the installation it would not go from disc one to disc two because there was a file missing (although all the other files were there. After a bad experience with customer service they sent me another disc 2. Of course disk 3 had the same problem. I was told they would overnight more replacements, they lied, 5 days later I still have not received anything. Customer support/tech support have been completely unhelpful and rude. I can't tell you about the product, but I would never buy anything from them again."
1,HORRIBLE program--don't waste your money,"I've never had so many problems with any software program. From the first time I ran it, Photo Explosion has given me almost endless error messages, and because I thought this was due to an incompatibility with Microsoft Vista, I downgraded my operation system to XP with absolutely no relief from the problems. Any time I so much as open Photo Explosion, I get the message, ""Ulead Photo Express has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.""I sent several messages to tech support via email, and their ""solutions"" always consist of uninstalling and reinstalling the program as well as checking for updates. I've done all of the above several times, and I'm still unable to use the program I spent $50.00 on. Please save your money for a more worthwhile product."
2,"good product, but Nova doesn't honor their REBATES! BEWARE","I've used this product before and liked it, so I thought I would buy the newer version when I upgraded to Vista. I got the product and did everything necessary to get the $20 rebate but NOVA stiffed me! After reading the message boards, NOVA apparently stiffs just about everybody on their rebates. BUYER BEWARE!!!!! This company will NEVER get my business again....never, ever again! I hope they are happy that they get to keep my $20, I'll buy a more expensive product just so I don't have to buy theirs!EDIT: I contacted Amazon concerning my rebate and Amazon honored the $20 rebate! Hooray! Amazon is AWESOME!!!!!"
5,great,I like working on my photos with this program. I haven't had any problems. It works great for me. Have made some really nice pics for printing.
5,Beats the Best,Delivery of this product was super fast 3 days!Very user friendly contains more bells and whistles than products costing 10 times more.Good results allt he time either printing editing can't go wrong.probably one sugestion pity it was not readly available in UKOtherwise don't think about it buy it you will not be disapointed even works with microsofts rubbish Vista
5,Careful with this product--IT'S ADDICTING!!!!!!!!,"It's so much easier to use than Adoby Photo Shop and way more affordable. I purchased this product three times, and have most of the editions."
1,I dare you to make it run...,"As a professional photographer I use Adobe Photoshop on a regular basis. My wife however is a bit intimidated by it. She just wants a simple, ""quick & painless"" program to play around with photos once in a while.Photo Explosion looked to be a good fit: Easy to use (per Nova Development) and cheap (compared to the Adobe Suite that I use.) Perfect for someone that doesn't want to tackle Photoshop.Well, it installed just fine... It's all there because I can find it. But it won't launch, so we've never actually used it. I've tried tech support and uninstalled & reinstalled but to no avail...it simply will NOT run. Oh yeah, the computer should be able to run it without a hitch.So while it looks like it might be a decent program...I have no way of knowing. Heck, even they seem to have trouble getting it to run. Looks like it's time to just get Photoshop Elements for her...that should make the move to Photoshop easier when she's ready as well.NOT recommended!"
3,No Ending,"Although the book was a very interesting read, most of the cases highlighted in it had not been solved by the time the book went to press, leaving me wondering what happened."
4,Welcome to LA - Third World Cesspool full of Criminal illegal aliens,"What was interesting was that most of the murders were committed by immigrants or illegal aliens. The First Chapter was the Russian sex trade in LA. They were all illegal and the woman who was murdered was selling other women. When she made her pot of gold she was going back to Russia.everyone comes here for money and they murder for it too.Another man came here and imported Brides from his own country , while he was a crook. This is called Chain immigration of course.I learned a lot about how easy it is for immigrants to come here.I would say that none of them made any attempt to intergrate into the dominant culture,they stayed in their own segregrated world( by choice) and murdered those close to them.This is what diversity is and I recommend that people go to Numbersusa dot com and find out how to limit immigration"
5,Tremendous Pacing....,"Easily one of the top true crime books I have ever read. Corwin has an eye for detail but doesn't get bogged down in minutia or wordiness. The pacing of the investigations lead to many, ""ok, I'll read one more chapter then quit"" episodes. The detectives' sense of humor and dark view of the underbelly of society is genuine and genuinely funny. Even the best fiction does not grab my attention like Corwin did. This work is on par with David Simon's ""Homicide."" Simply put, a must read."
2,Why China-made?,"The Agri-Fab garden cart is easy to assemble. But, I could tell as soon as I opened the box that it was a shadow of my old one. The plywood is flimsy, thin, soft wood, and generally NOT the type that should be used in carts that will have to take shovels, pitch forks, varied loads of mulch, gravel and the like. I'm very disappointed that Agri-Fab does not produce a top quality cart and make it in the USA. I'd be willing to pay more for better quality. I wouldn't be surprised if the rubber wheels fail in the first 6 months."
2,Ruining a very good name,"I have purchased a number of Agri-Fab pieces of equipment for my lawn work and this is the first one I have ever been disappointed in --- from day 1. I assembled this yesterday and then realized --- I should have read the reviews before purchasing. I didn't do that because of the name on the product. Had I seen ""Made in China"" before ordering, I might not have ordered it, but a lot of items made in China are very good. This cart was designed by a team of accountants and two sight-challenged quality engineers whose only objective was CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Very cheaply made."
4,garden cart,although the wooden material could have been a little sturdier-the cart itself is very usefull-i use it for all garden chores as well as hauling other items such as garbage to the curb.
1,Not worth it,"This item is MUCH smaller than the listed dimensions.They do not list the ""box"" measurements, and do not tell you that the measurements include the handle. This is TINY... if you are considering this item, buy the bigger 14 cu. ft. cart... and you should be happier."
1,below average quality and a terrible odor out of the box,"This gardenway knock off is of elow average quality and had apparently been fumigated or treated somehow inside the container or box, with a not very healthy odor that had to be aired out for 10 days before assembly.Wierd green color of the plywood not apparent in photos. Look further for a better product."
3,Harden My Cart,"I used this wagon for my part time work on mansions in Western European countries. I pick up dead rodents, corpses and leaves on estates and clean up yard debris (old graves, tree roots, and dirty ponds); these are huge acres of land so I need a sturdy, large wagon to do the work.With this wagon, it's not built very well so it will not last if you use it often. Also, it said 300 lb weight capacity, which is wrong, I had a 238 lb worker sit on it while I pulled it around. I also pushed around 500 lbs of broken marble statues. The wagon moved sluggishly and eventually just broke apart in a few months.If you don't have a small pony or a trained dog to pull the wagon, you'll have to do it yourself, which can get tiring if you are loading up with heavy fruits, old bundles of clothes, or sacks of rotten bird feed.In all, there's better wagons out there."
2,Agri Fab experience,"I ordered the Agri-Fab Farm/Yard cart and it arrived with various bits of hardware falling out of the box. The box was intact and not damaged during shipping. The bag containing the various bolts, washers, nuts and pieces was ripped open by whoever packed it. I called Agri-Fab to explain the situation and give them a list of what was needed. After 15 minutes on hold I gave the CSR the model number and part numbers for the missing parts. The CSR told me he could not help me get the various parts without a date code and it would be better for me if I just went to a hardware store and bought them instead of waiting. Very poor response."
2,Don't waste your time,"This is horrible quality, poorly made, and can't handle much. It is great if you are living in a condo or townhouse and need to transport a few flowers from one side to the other. But it isn't for any type of serious yard work."
2,Choreography too hard,"I bought this video because I wanted to try something different from step aerobics. I've been exercising for years and pick up steps fairly quickly. With this DVD, however, the instructor did not give great cues and changed things up too fast. I couldn't follow the routine. I got very frustrated because I wasn't even breaking a sweat. Consequently, I got my jump rope out and just started doing my own thing. What a waste of money and time."
1,Overly Complicated Routines,This video is best for those more interested in dancing than in getting an aerobic workout. The routines are overly complicated and it's difficult to get a good heart rate going. I've been doing aerobics longer than Alison has been alive and have amassed a huge library of aerobics videos; this is my least favorite. I'm so disappointed in this particular installment of The Firm videos that I'm going to donate my copy to the local library.
5,Fun!,"I love Alison Davis's workouts; especially this one. She gives good instructions, though it may still take a few runs-through to catch all the steps. But while you're concentrating on learning what comes next you forget about how hard you're working. Before you know it you've had a great cardio workout! The dance steps are a nice change from typical aerobic moves. This DVD adds great variety to your routine. Buy it!"
2,King Kelson's Bride,"Another boring book! And I thought the last one was boring! I should have waited for this one to come out in paperback - after all, if I've waited, what, 8-10 years since the last one, I could surely have waited another year for this one.There is little real action in this book, and very little of Deryni capabilities. Mostly the book has detailed descriptions of castles or land or other frivolities - I skipped pages of that sort of stuff - and little character interaction.It also ties everything up in pretty wrapping paper and a big bow. Come on, life is not like that! Even in fairy tales someone loses, and in this book no one loses, everyone ends up with what they want.It took me 4 hours to read this book. Course, it took me 4 hours to read the last one too."
3,"One plot wonderful, one plot... not so much.","The plot concenring Torenth and Liam was wodnerfully well done and enjoyable. This book is worth reading for this plot alone.The orther plot, about Kelson's marriage left me a little cold. The politicking around it was interesting, but thee fact that he's been pining for Rothana for three years and then marries the woman she suggests... first, his feelings for Rothana aren't love anymore, they're obsession and Araxia is just too perfect.Read the Toernthi plotline, skim through the Kelson's marriage plot.Don't these people have flaws?"
2,"Was SO looking forward to this one, but....","It's been a few years since I eagerly bought this book and read it, but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I've been a devoted Kurtz fan since the early 80's when an Army buddy gave me a copy of Deryni Rising and told me to read it, I read the book in one night!This book left much to be desired, not enough Morgan for my taste and seemsed so wishy washy.....not up to her usually high work standard!I so wish she would go back and re-write this book, it just seemed so rushed and lacking the magic....FORGIVE ME KATHERINE!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I love the Deryni series, but this book was a disappointment. I think it center way too much on the marriage. After the 3rd or 4th times Kurtz stated why Kelson was marrying Araxie, it became annoying. It took up to 100 pages before Kelson set off to Torenth, which I know could have progress faster from reading Kurtz earlier works. The action was definitely lacking, and the political intrigue not fully developed. This book definitely was not written to par with the other in the series. What a disappointment :_("
3,Medieval Fashion Show?,"I have been a fan of Katherine Kurtz since I first picked up ""Camber of Culdi"" in college. Looking at the various books, I saw her knowledge of medieval culture grow and her writing style mature.It is unfortunate that with ""King Kelson's Bride,"" Ms. Kurtz has so fallen in love with the trappings of royalty . . . the gowns and tunics and cloaks . . . the jewelry, the crowns and ceremonials (and on and on and on) that she forgot to write a plot on which to hang all this gorgeous pageantry. Furthermore, King Kelson and his colleagues have taken to speaking in the language of diplomatic dispatches and official court announcements -- even when they are having an intimate conversation in private.I was left with the feeling (upon reading the book) of an extravagant masquerade -- beautiful to look at, but devoid of authentic human emotion. The enthronement of a vassal king is the pivot around which both villains and heroes posture -- all of them dressed in the best medieval fashion."
2,I'm so disappointed.,"I've been waiting for this book over 10 years but I figured the wait would be worth it (if only to read more of the adventures of the enigmatic, powerful, strong yet vulnerable Alaric Morgan and his equally magically powerful priest-cousin, Duncan).Kurtz' rich characters have been my all-time favorite fictional entities. But King Kelson's Bride left me bereft, sad. Morgan and Duncan are barely recognizable, when they do show up at all. Maybe because I'm over the age of 40 now, but teenage angst irks me. If I wanted a romance novel I'd have bought a romance novel.I'm hoping, praying, that Miss Kurtz will rejuvenate her beloved (our beloved) characters of old in her next novel. I'm so upset with this one I'm even considering sending it back (but my Katherine Kurtz keeper shelf would look a little bare without it there, I guess).Please, Miss Kurtz, bring back Morgan, Duncan and Derry. The original Morgan, Duncan and Derry!"
2,also disappointed,"This book, while fairly well written, is little more than a cheap and sappy romance next to the other books in the series. The undying love for rothana, and the budding romance with arexie turned my stomach, not to mention the sticky sweet scene with the children. The attempt to bring Derry back as a the great character he was in the first kelson series accomplished little more than rehashing an old plotline. i was disappointed. Katherine Kurtz is a great writer, but I think she may have sucked this particular universe dry."
2,Not as good as her other stuff,"It felt much as though the primary characters had done nothing short of sit in a dark hole for the three years between their last appearance and now. They had not changed or grown in those years. I got very tired of mopey Kelson, when his emotions felt contrived to begin with.Things that felt resolved in previous books were miraculously unresolved in this one. Rules about magic that have been previously declared inviolable were suddenly questionable. A lot of the intrigue felt like it was there solely for the sake of intrigue.I did like some of the parts of this book and it has opened the world a little more for further Deryni education and informational quests. I also liked the development of Jehanna."
2,Dissapointly Dull,"This book is dissapointingly unlike Kurtz's other Deryni novels. The intrigue, magic, style and depth and style of her earlier works is missing. At times I found myself wondering if Kurtz even wrote this book. That, or was just a contractual obligation and she didn't really want to write it? The earlier Deryni novels are much better written, and this one does not come up to the same standard. Kurtz's previous Deryni novels are like stepping into a whole other world. This one is a lot like stepping into a tired and trite romance novel."
3,"Deryni ""lite""","I did enjoy this book, although I must admit that I hesitated to pick it up for quite some time. Being accustomed to frequent torture, death, heartbreak, and general grim reality in the previous novels of this series I felt the need to prepare myself for the next installment. Imagine my surprise when good things happened to the characters, not just once but throughout the book! Upon reflection, I would say that I enjoyed the book but found it to be quite a bit lighter than those that came before. The characters don't suffer; even Kelson's anguish as he selects a bride for logical rather than emotional reasons is a bit forced. Is this the final installation, the tying off of all the lose ends?"
2,Not up to her usual excellence,"It seems I waited forever to be able to purchase and read a copy of KING KELSON'S BRIDE...and boy, was I disappointed! The characters didn't seem as rich and full and vibrant as they had been in Katherine's previous novels. Morgan and Duncan, especially, were quite pale in comparison to their former selves in other novels, and even Kelson didn't seem to have much of a spark at times. The talk of all the royal marriages confused me after a while--I couldn't keep track of who was to wed whom. I liked the fact that Jehana has started to live again, rather than continuing to sequester herself away and be so morbid and angry all the time. All in all, I was quite unsatisfied by the time I finished the book, especially as I've feasted on the literary wonders from Katherine in the past and was expecting more of the same. Maybe her SECOND novel in this series will be better."
2,Disappointed,"The worst of the Deryini novels by far. I hate to give one of Ms. Kurtz's Deryini novels a bad review because her work has given me great pleasure over the years, but this novel stinks. Any one of her others in the series I'd give a 4 star rating at worst. Even the look of the cover has a look one wouldn't expect from this author--a cheesy romance. She has changed publishers. Could this have anything to do with the turn towards the worse her writing has taken? Normally her novels are serious page-turners for me, keeping me up to all hours of the morning, but I had to force myself over the course of several months to finish this one. If you are a fan go ahead and buy it; if new to the series, don't bother."
2,"Too Little, Too Long in Coming","After waiting since 1986 for Kurtz to return to Kelson and the plot threads left hanging in ""The Quest for Saint Camber"", this book was a disappointment. Instead of following up on the quest for Camber, Kelson gets married. Granted, after the tragedy of Rothana, Kelson deserves some happiness, but this book felt rushed, almost as if Kurtz decided to stop writing Deryni novels all together and wrapped things up in one fell swoop. Kurtz has shown that she has a knack for tragedy, notably in ""King Javan's Year"", and the previous series on Kelson tended to mix in a good part of that. If she continues this into a trilogy, let's hope she gets back to what she's good at."
2,Not a worthy sequel,"Katherine Kurtz doesn't seem to have had her heart in the Deryni books for many years. This book, which was written and then ""left hanging"" (sans sequel), seems to prove it. Compared to the subtle plot twists, action, and adventure of earlier books, the plot is fascile and the pace is slow.Fans of the Deryni books will probably read this volume anyway, eager for anything new on the topic. They will then endure a recap of events they vaguely remember from books read over a decade ago. Following this, all the characters talk and talk about who King Kelson will marry. Then they talk about talking about it. After the inevitable ""surprise Deryni ancestry"" revelations, the usual pack of fanatics and evil Deryni will try and thwart the wedding and will be defeated. Then King Kelson will marry the woman who was discussed and discussed.I was so excited that I decided not to wait another long span of years for another volume and gave up on KK after 30 years!"
2,Night Walker....not so good,"This is the first book by Hamilton I have read. Despite wanting to love this book, it just wasn't very good. The plot is simple, the characters are weak, and the conclusion is, well, hard to believe. After reading the book, I felt as though it was a waste of time. There was nothing memorable or redeeming (or suspenseful, for that matter) about the book. I'm going to try some of his other works to get a more balanced view. Perhaps this was simply not his best piece of writing."
4,As good as ever -,"I really thought I'd probably read this book the first time around. I certainly read a lot of Hamilton's non-Matt Helm books when they were first new, but this story didn't ring any particular bells for me. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable reading all the way through. Maybe having lived through that era of Communist paranoia renders the story more believable now, when other forms of paranoia are even more rampant.It's wonderfully well-written, with enticing, believable characters and a plot that makes as much or more sense as anything newer, so what's not to like? To be sure, I was a bit taken aback by the ending, but it's merely one variation of many that were possible. Really, I think it's a 4 1/2 star book.Kudos to Hard Case Crime for keeping these older gems polished and lively!"
3,Entertaining novel from Hamilton,"A pleasant and distracting novel from Donald Hamilton, the creator of the Matt Helm series of novels (which were made into campy Bond style movies starring Dean Martin).The premise of a bandaged nobody mistaken for a US soldier who commited treason is intreguing and for the most part quite well done, but the pace of the novel is a little behind the times and you may find yourself trudging through character developement which would be quickly established in a modern novel, but if you can forgive this little minus, then you should have some fun reading ahead.As for the edition itself, I must nominate this for the worse HCC cover so far. Tim Gabor's style is unsuitable for the subject matter and unworthy to stand next to the other great covers in the series."
2,A slow-going soft-boiled novel,"The excellent, gripping first chapter of NIGHT WALKER is sadly the best part of the book. The tale slows down considerably and shifts into a rather muddled mess afterward. A Navy officer is called back to active duty and gets a ride while hitchhiking only to be attacked by his presumed samaritan. With a battered, bandaged face he is forced to play the role of his attacker, a ruse he goes along with for no good reason other than the fact that he just doesn't want to go back into the military.A vague mystery unfurls as he's drawn into a web of deceit by his ""wife"", a nefarious doctor, and his innocent neighbor who suspects the truth but doesn't know what to do about it. There's some hooey about communists, drop-off points for Washington attaches, and other dubious plot points, but the worst is the psychological hokum used to explain away a major contrivance."
1,Just not very good,"So far this is my least favorite of the Hard Case Crime books that I've read (of 12, I believe). Just didn't work for me..."
3,Typical Hardcore,These guys are good to an extent. They are just your average brand of metal/hardcore. Worth checking out if you like Skylines or any other band on Blood and Ink records.
3,do not believe 5 stars from Cassandra Smith,"Please note: 5 stars from Cassandra Smith should be taken with a very large caveat: she works for the people selling the product! I call this a conflict of interest. Click on her name and ""see all my reviews"" and you will see dozens of 5 star (suprise, surprise) ratings for products from this company. ALL rated 5 stars! Even her alias ""EXQFC"" can be seen to represent Exquisite Fine Candy & Gifts. Amazon should not allow representatives of the company selling the product, to review that same product. I realize that may be hard to detect - but this one is so blatant...Cassandra, remove your reviews...it's the only ethical thing to do."
1,Over priced,"This cost $30 more than a piece of 2x12"" scrap wood. Take a trip to the lumbar yard first. Think about it..."
5,Great,hi-lift jack base... Heavy duty plastic and jack fits perfectly in it. Used it on the sand to jack my 7000 lb truck without a problem.
1,It's a RIP OFF not being included with the base unit,"This is an accessory that is really necessary for safety! It, or something similar, should be included with the base unit. At $35.00 it is a RIP OFF! You're paying more than half the price of an all-steel jack for a piece of plastic. I'm sure it's durable but the company should be ashamed of itself for charging so much extra for a safety item. Quite a few years ago, a ""lift"" jack was included with new cars and they included a large metal base that provided the extra stability this item provides at an extra charge."
5,It is what it is.,"Very solid, and heavier than I expected. It does its job spreading the weight over a larger area to prevent sinking into soft ground. The jack itself is fine if being used on a hard surface."
5,A great listen,"Tommy Sancton is a new discovery for us (and we are experienced jazz buyers, having more than 1,000 CDs). We enjoyed this disk, partly because it is not simply a compilation of the songs everybody records: only five songs are standards, and there are songs on here we had never heard. Just wish Sancton would make more CDs."
3,Shame On This Abridgement!,"As a student of the Bible for over a decade, I've read countless commentaries on the Old and New Testaments. Most of these great authors kept quoting Dr. Adam Clarke. The information always quoted from Dr. Clarke was to say the least awe-inspiring, so I knew I had to purchase this commentary one day. The unfortunate news is that the abridger Ralph Earle has removed extremely important information such as the correct order of chapters of Jeremiah (which are incorrect in our current Bibles), as well as the 39 verses in 1 Samuel which are of doubtful authenticity, and should not have been included in the Holy Bible account. The book get three stars because I wanted to give Dr. Adam Clarke his deserved praise, but not a five star rating because of the irresponsible job done by Ralph Earle. We should all seek out the original 3-book series, or if out-of-print, search for the unabridged version on CD-Rom."
4,An OK item for $60.00,My friends dad has bought this item and i have used this before.It is not so great. You can find even better items for a reasonable cost.
5,This is just THE BEST book!,"For anyone who is interested in learing about The Orishas or the Religion, this is a wonderful story to read."
2,No meat and potatoes,"This is a great book if you are looking for reflection, inspiration and introspection, but not if you want real information about the yoruba religion. It could essentially have been written about any religion. Basically, its all fluff - and no meat and potatoes."
5,Great devotional book to read daily,"Clear and condensed teachings and thoughts helping readers grow in Bible knowledge and holiness, and God's truths to apply in daily life."
4,excellent device,"i've used this for over 3 years. Gives excellent support for ""loose"" knees by stabalizing tendons in upper and lower areas of the knee cap."
4,Pain relief without having to take meds and good knee support too,"This knee strap has helped me greatly when I'm having trouble sleeping from knee and foot pain. I don't like to take over-the-counter meds all the time (usually acetaminophen) and I refuse to use any prescription pain killers to be able to sleep. This knee strap helps relieve both knee and foot pain that I have been able to sleep most of the time without taking any meds. I sometimes use it while walking and it has helped relieve that pain too and support my knee well. The top strap tends to slide down a lot, but the bottom strap has never slipped. It needs some sort of side supports to help keep the top strap in place. (I bought 2 of these from different vendors, so I'm leaving feedback for both.)"
4,cho-pat knee strap,The Cho-Pat knee strap does what it claims to do....Holds the patella area in place and thus provides stability.
3,Beware of Size,"Based on what others wrote, I ordered one of these. Unfortunately, the medium is so small that it must be for a child or very skinny person who does not have any inflammation.The strap does indeed appear to be well made but the product descriptions do not allow for proper selection of sizes. I assumed that football players would be ""large"" but maybe these are made for use by children?"
3,"Good songs, great sound, fine notes.","While the Dorsey/Sinatra era is not everyone's favorite, this CD paints a fine, sentimental portrait of the time. Buddha records has done a fabulous job of remastering the material, there are virtually no clicks, pops or hiss that could be found on RCA's ""The Song Is You"" discs. The liner notes, by Will Friedwald, are as clear and detailed as you would expect from this knowledgeable author, and the songs themselves really send me. Sinatra sings with exceptional smoothness and sounds fresh and inspired, and there is lots of great instrumental interplay and some helping hands from the other band vocalists. The disc gives the impression of listening to a 1940's radio show, with spoken introductions and some audience applause added. Fun, inconsequential listening."
3,Learn To Croon,"Keep in mind the credits on this CD before you buy: it is Sinatra AND Dorsey and, as such, the spotlight is not entirely on Sinatra.As one reviewer has already pointed out (while missing the point), this is music from a big band whose fine singer went on to become a legend. But, at the time, it was the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra with Frank Sinatra; it was only decades later than people began calling it Frank Sinatra & Tommy Dorsey.That said, this is a fine release. Dorsey swang, though the Sinatra of the 1950s probably would have looked down his nose at some of the whitebread-honking solos on these tracks. Pre-war swing and cold-war swing are different animals.Sinatra does his idol-and-nemesis El Bingo one better on ""Learn To Croon"" and plays his part well, but it's still hard to understand how the skinny Brooklyn crooner became the Chairman Of The Board and The Voice in later incarnations."
4,Enjoyable read,"I found this an entertaining novel. I came into it with 0 expectations. Therefore, Engstrom's writing and creativity were a pleasant surprise. She's very good at creating mood and (reader)empathy with her words. The plot moves along at a steady and interesting pace. For me, the highlight of the book was Enid's mipulation of Andrew in order to get money for her sons' education. The writing surrounding this plot element is fantastic(humorous too)! As far as the story, my only disappointment is no detailed recreation of the murders. I thought this would be a bigger part of the book but was only afforded a few sentences. Big letdown for me after waiting 300+ pages for the main event. Overall, though, I'd recommend this book and give it 4 stars for a job very well done. I look forward to reading another one of her books."
2,Not For the Serious Borden Enthusiast,"I picked up this book one day while looking for a study on the Borden case. It was only after I started reading it that I realized it was fiction. The book kept my interest and I read it through. The author definitely researched the subject, offering an analysis of the characters and living arrangements of the Borden household. But for someone like me who wanted to learn more about the history of the crime, a novel will not do. From Lizzie's odd relationship with her father to her sexual experimentation, it is a very disturbing account. Engstrom's version of the crime itself, I'll warn you, is very homoerotic. It was a little much for my tastes."
3,Fiction based on Fact requires Bacground Knowledge,"This sounds like an interesting novel to read about this famous case since it is based on facts.But you should read Arnold R. Brown's ""Lizzie Borden: The Legend, the Truth, the Final Chapter"" and David Kent's ""40 Whacks"" for background information."
3,"Worked, at first.","After reading the reviews on this product I decided the product would be worth the price. I used the oil control gel almost every day and it worked great, at first. I'm glad I waited to review this product because after a couple of weeks my skin seemed to become used to it. It began to become oily again sooner and sooner every time I used it. I now only use it every once in a while and it works okay. I was a little disappointed it didn't work for me very long after spending that much money."
2,Tease Zone,I've been using this product since November. I must have the oiliest skin on the planet. I thought the product worked at first but my skin is oily an hour after I put on my makeup. I use blotters and can completley soak up 4 of them at a time 3x a day at least. And that is with no strenuous activity. I'm 43 and still have zits and sometimes cystic acne every now and then. If anyone knows something that will help me let me know please!
5,it really works,"I have been using this for about two years and it is the best product I have found for oil control. I have VERY oily skin, and this takes the shine beautifully. You may need to apply twice a day and blot here and there, but its worth your money. I can go about 6 hours before I need to reapply it. If you have ever cried because you cant even rest your forehead on a flat surface without leaving a slick.. (gross, I know) try this and cry for the right reasons!"
1,poos,"It didn't do squat, I tried it once (for my wedding & reception, a nice cool day & evening so no excuses for hot, sweaty weather there) & now I can't even return it. There's 35 or whatever dollars down the drain."
4,Pretty Amazing,"I have never reviewed a product before, but I felt compelled to do so with this one. I am a 26-year-old female with extremely oily skin and have tried countless products to counteract the shine. This one works better than anything I have ever tried and keeps my face looking fresh for almost my entire shift at work, which is about 9 hours. Sometimes I do still need to blot my nose, but even that's not usually an issue until about 6 hours or so have passed. Plus, it doesn't take much of the gel to cover my face, so I expect it to last a long time. For me, it is definitely worth the money!"
5,oil slicks beware,If you have oily skin then you know how disappointing it is when you buy an oil control product that does not deliver. And they normally never do. But this product really works. My skin is extremely oily so I have to apply this product 2-3 times per day. But a little goes a long way so you don't need to apply alot. And it is not too drying either so no flaking or irritation. This is worth every penny.
5,I love this!,"I've been using this for several years and I adore it. i have really really oily skin that nothing else worked on, and this stuff totally controls my oiliness. I used to use a half dozen blotting sheets a day, and I haven't had to use one in years. The bottle lasts forever, too.The only problem with it is that it leaves white streaks, but I find that a little pore minimizing moisturizer on top of it fixes this problem, and is good for my skin, and makes my pores look better.Everyone needs to buy this so they keep making it!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this product because I'd been researching it for a while. It is silky on your skin, but for me, I thought this product made me break out! I don't usually get lots of breakouts on my skin, but for some reason after using this I noticed more and more especially on my cheeks and forehead.I'm not sure why it didn't work for me, and I was disappointed because I do have oily skin!Maybe it was in combination with other stuff, but I didn't like it. And I didn't notice a difference at all in the amount of oil on my face."
5,Awesome,"I was never much of a strokes fan, but this song defienetlly got me into them. Its mind blowing."
1,Desk Lamp,I was very disappointed because I bought this lamp as a Christmas presentfor my daughter and it does not work. The switch was missing. I tried tocall the company where the lamp is from but I get no answer. I lost $25.00plus my daughter thinks Santa Claus gave her a broken present.
2,"Desk lamp by ""American Lamps"" which is made in china.... right....","Cheaply made, and trying to deceive, I dont appreciate that.Everywhere on the box it tries to tell you its made in america. Big american flag, ""American Lamps"" cheap thing. I was like ""hmm, why is my ""American Lamp"" coming with a ruler thats covered in Chinese?So I looked in the lamp shade.""Made in China""Okay... that explains alot, and the marketing is so shady, I almost want to throw it out of the window rather then have it in here for fear of what could potentially be wrong with it."
4,"Clever Plot, Competent acting, Soft, grainy transfer","I enjoyed the plot twists that unfolded as the film moved along. Competent acting. I'm surprised Leslie Brooks isn't better known in the film noir genre. Perfect for the part. I agree, the ending was too abrupt. Rather than having a confession, I would have preferred more clever detective work to nail the killer.The audio is clear and distince, but plagued by a bit of hiss and crackle. The picture is quite soft in places. One wishes for sharper detail and crisper edges. Perhaps this is the best VCI could do with the original material."
1,not a good machine,the machine is not very good when we tried to cut meat with it the blade is going sideways so we tried to ajust the blade and with little force the ajustement made of cast broke in half. we tried to return the cutter but they only want to give us a new ajustement and this is not wat we wnated a complete waste of money
4,Kili's best!,"Out of all of the Island Girl DVDs I own, this one is my favorite. Although I don't work up a sweat using the other Island Girl DVDs, this one I usually do! (I consider the Island Girl hula videos to be more toning in nature for the abs and legs and use them as such...I don't count the Island Girl DVDs as ""cardio"" per se).Some good music, good moves. My only qualm is that during the final dance the music doesn't ""quite"" match up with what's happening on screen. Kili and the girls are just a bit faster than the music, so near the end of the final dance I have to ignore what the girls are doing and just follow the audio.Fun stuff though, and (as with all of the Island Girl DVDs) I can Really feel my abs and hips working!Recommend to beginners/low intermediates"
4,Pretty fun and my obliques felt it,"I hate doing cardio so I bought this dvd. Plus I figured with all that dancing my abs may get worked too. Kili the instructor is in fantastic shape. She should make some strength training dvd's. You should see all if her muscle, I was impressed. It took a few times doing the dvd to get used to the moves which were all clearly demonstrated. After awhile my obliques were on fire. I did not sweat but this was definately fun. And Im sure the more I use this dvd over time it will slim the hips and abs. I have a feeling I was not sweating because Im not the best dancer and I was not going as fast as the girls. I think as time goes by using this dvd will help you be good at hula dancing. Overall this is a fun dvd and you will definatly see results in the waistine."
5,Nice little workout,"I have been doing this DVD for a little while now and I find it very enjoyable.True that it is not a workout for hard core power exercisers, but it is fun and gets you moving. You are finished with it and onto cool down before you even realize that you have worked your heart rate up. I also like the fact that this workout was a bit gentler on my joints than some of the other's I have tried.The music is good, the cues are good, the instructions are clear and understandable, the scenery is lovely. Great beginner workout or it would be a great workout for days when you want something a little bit more mellow than a pounding FIRM workout.Even my teenaged daughter does this workout with me and enjoys it.After you know the routine, there is an option in the special features that allows you to turn off the cues and just do the workout to music... nice!"
5,Fun and it works!,This workout is a fun way to change up a boring workout routine but you still get a good workout.
5,Great authentic hula in workout form,"I loved her since her first DVDs ""Hula Workout"" though those used cutsy 60s music & added 60s american dance moves but still have a lot of authetic hula dancing.These ""Island Girl"" hula workouts are more authentic. Just like her other ones, you get a great workout, your abs burn, your hips, legs get a nice workout. It's all authentic dance moves with some added quick squats, etc. added in so you barely notice it for adding toning. The authentic drum Hawaiian music is beautiful & does keep you stimulted too keep going just like a dance/rock beat would.I had no trouble following & learning the steps, there are plenty of dance DVDs that I have had trouble with, but she breaks everything down well & shows it slowly several times before speeding it up. She even cues YOUR left & right, not hers.There's a trailer for her ""Hula Workout"" DVDs & another authentic Hula workout like this called ""Island Girl: Hula Abs & Buns"" at collagevideo com"
5,A Lot of Fun!,This DVD is a great workout! I enjoyed the hula moves and really felt them in my abs and legs the next day. The DVD is also fun to watch because the background behind the instructor is so beautiful! I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wanted to try hula and get a great workout!
4,Chibinate me Capin',"WARNING: This book is not for beginers. There are few step by step instructions, the rest you have to figure out on your own. (you lazy people)For those who are not beginers, this book goes fairly deep into the world of Chibi characters. It shows basics in body structures and facial expressions.It also touches bases on many catgirl body types.I feel this book gives you a wide variety of ideas that you can use to create catgirls.All and all this is one of Mr. Hart's better books. One of the facts is that he put less of his style into this book. Which causes it to become more manga, not americanized/manga that he usually draws.Which is a good thing.I really like the section in the back about stylized chibi's from Japan."
1,What are they thinking?,"This is NOT a very good ""how to draw manga"" book.The cat-girl section does not look like manga... In fact, it looks like an American comic. This is not worth getting. All it will do is misguide a beginning manga artist."
3,A kid's review: it's okay.,"When this book arrived in the mail, i was really excited! i quickly started to read the book. some of the drawings, look a bit cartoony. the book was okay, it was still cute. Also, it gave me a few ideas for chibi costumes. it was pretty good, but it was still just a bit cartoony for me. if you want, you could get the book. the book is okay, but it might not get you where you want to go."
4,Manga Mania's Chibi and Furry Characters is really a must have for Manga Arists.,I myself personally have difficulty drawing chibi character's. This book is very thorough with the basic how to's of drawing chibis. IT even teaches you to think outside out the box when creating fantastical little monsters. I highly recommend this book.
5,Rockin',"For a while i thought i couldn't draw. Then i got this for christmas. w00t! Hart does such a great job showing the reader how to draw! Maybe its the fact that my porportion drawing sucks, because the wonderful world of chibis actually encourages the artist to make a fat, big headed, short limbed character! My drawing are adorable now! The book takes you step by step until you;ve reached max cuteitude! If i had known it would rock so much, i wouldn't have waited!"
3,Rock With A Lot Of Potential,"I had never heard of Eat No Fish when I saw the band live as warm-up for Liquido. Immediately after the gig, I wanted to buy Greedy For Life - but I had to wait a few days because it was sold out right after the concert!Eat No Fish offers a worthwile mixture of harder yet melodic rock which is spiced up by non-superfluous synth elements.It is noisy, it is full of power - but it has a lot of soul too. The lead singeress is very enthusiastic, and Eat No Fish expresses exactly that joy of playing music that a debut band has to express.A very promising debut! One of the best debuts in years!"
2,DEFECTIVE MOTOR,"I installed this replacement rad/cond cooling fan assembly and it did nit turn on.After taking it to my mechanic and having him perform diagnostics , when the fan should be on low it vbarely turns and when it should be on high , it spins at approx the low speed.So consequently I have to remove and replace it and install another.I dont even know how to go about the return process.I would be very hesitant to buy another part from this mfr.Mike Stombock"
4,They still make these!!,"I have been looking for this product for decades. Seriously. I didn't think they made them any more. I am so awesomely stoked to find this on Amazon. No more sagging socks for the properly dressed gentleman. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the clip rubs on the front of my shin, leaving a sore after a few days. It maybe should have a little more padding on the back. That may be why this garment went out of fashion. Nevertheless, Im glad to have found them."
1,personal experience,I found the men's sock garters to be well constructed and designed. The problem I encountered is the uncomfortable restriction caused by the strong elastic and the painful pressure point caused by the adjustment buckle. I have worn them one time and am not soliciting a refund.
4,"Sock Garters? Old fashion, sure, but useful.","Af first, I was skeptical but, then it occurred to me I wouldn't be wasting a lot of money if I didn't like it, so I decided to try them anyway.Good move. If I knew it, I'd have bought them earlier. Socks stay in place the whole day. For some (unexplained) reason, some days, the metal clip hurts a little (little, I repeat). It's not like ""hurting"", ""hurting"", it's more like there's a 'pressing sensation' on your legs. Maybe it's because, yes, you do have something on your calves...That shouldn't deter you in any case. The benefit of not having soggy socks on your ankles will compensate the minimum discomfort."
4,Keep Koi,"Good Information material to start a project. Great pictures, easy reading. Complete description. I will Recomend this product to my friends."
1,"Great performance, poor transfer","I've managed to dip into three different transfers of this magnificent 1950 recording of Rigoletto: Myto, Preiser, and Naxos. The Myto transfer, the one listed here, is by far the worst of the three. The Naxos is easily the best."
2,"Boring if you're not Caribbean-American, or at least African-American","I had to read this over the summer for school, and I really hated this book. Part of the reason is that I couldn't relate to Selina, and the book was overly descriptive. I'll also agree with the person who said ""What ending?"" This book might be interesting if you're Caribbean or even African American. For a white Jewish girl living in the suburbs, it's not."
3,It ain't me babe,"I found it hard to relate to this as I'm not from Brooklyn or Barbados. I never was a little girl growing into womanhood either. It does not give the men much credit, but perhaps that's the way it is in that part of the world."
5,Sighting in the 717,"After doing the preliminary sighting in at 20', I was very pleased with one particular pellet. It has a copper bb on top of a lead base. Other style pellets were not giving me consistent groups. I moved my target out to 64' and fined tuned the back sight. Acorns are starting to fall, so I used duct tape to hold one on top of my card board box. The first shot poked a hole in the acorn at 64'!"
2,carry compass all the time if you plan to use this,"if you try to get driving directions using this software, It will tell you to go northwest and west and southeast rather than make left and right.. very lousy software.. does not tell which exit to take and if you carry compass , then only you can figure out where to turn.. very disappointing.. I am returning this software.. rather use mapquest.com to get sensible directions.."
4,"Nice, but was difficult to assemble at first","I had a lot of trouble assembling this chair until I hit upon the idea of using a clamp to bring the back of the chair and the seat together (step 1 of the assembling process). After that, everything was straightforward, but still took over an hour for me. It looks nice assembled though."
4,Powell Accent Chair,"Love this chair very comfortable and a good size. The seat cushion is big. It was very easy to put together. But the 1st one I got the holes weren't drilled right. I called AMAZON, packed the chair back up, they came and picked it up and brought me a new one. Just a slight inconvience. No extra charge to me."
3,"Great compilation, but far too pricey","In America, this compilation is titled 'Greatest Hits' and is part of RCA's 'Greatest Hits' series, focusing on the legends of jazz and their best RCA Victor sides. Frank Sinatra started out in Tommy Dorsey's big band before making a name for himself on his own.However, this is far too pricey. On July 17, 2008, the price is $107.55 for 15 songs. In America, you can get this for about $3.00. It's far more cheaper here.All that's different about the U.S. release and the import release is the cover and the packaging. In America, the cover is sketch drawn by legendary cartoonist Al Hirschfield; in the import releases, it's just a picture of Frank and Tommy in the early 1940s.Overall, the songs here are five songs. I am a proud owner of this release, but I own the American version. This is highly recommended, but do yourself a favor and save your money. Buy 'Greatest Hits.' It's about 98.9% cheaper."
3,Different to what i thought!,I had to read this book for Literature. It was actually heaps better than i thought. i thought that it would be really boring and so totally out of date. But when i read it i realised it was actually quite relevant to the 90's. Sophocles is a really excellent writer and i'm soooo glad that i read the book.
1,Poorly Organized,"A pathetic waste of money! This book is consists mostly of practice exams that have been collected and placed into one volume. Some of the diagrams and graphs on these exams are hand written and barely legible. After each exam is a solution page that gives the answers to the questions. The Solution page, unfortunately,doesn't explain the theories behind the answers. At the end of the book there is a short study guide, written is small font, that provides an overview to the material needed for the exam. Overall, this book looks like bits and pieces from other books that have shoved together into one volume. ...s, one should expect a better organised study guide."
3,Just Ok.....,"This dvd contains 2 film noir movies: THE SCAR (1948--80 min.) starring Paul Henreid and THE LIMPING MAN (1953--76 min.) starring Lloyd Bridges.THE SCAR i would say is the more interesting of these 2 pretty good noir movies. The audio and video quality would rank about a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10. They both look pretty good, but they both have several splices and scratches. The audio is fairly clear on both except THE LIMPING MAN has a couple of bad spots. This disc contains an episode of THE STAR AND THE STORY titled ""Dark Stranger"" starring Edmond O'Brien and a young Joanne Woodward as a bonus. The quality of the bonus episode is very good. It also contains a film noir poster gallery which is cool. All in all this dvd is OK, but it's nothing to cheer about. Let's hope someday an excellent quality disc of both films comes out."
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING!!!!!,"I felt disappointed with the quality of this VCI release. The Limping Man has splices and noisy audio in spots. The Scar seemed to have transfer problems with splicing and a worn print. The Alpha edition of Scar isn't as sharp, but is somewhat preferable to this since their print isn't splicy."
3,Not entirely happy,"I've made at least 6 different types of ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt since receiving this as a gift. Even though I've followed the directions carefully, chilled both the bowl and the mix as directed, the consistency of the end product tends to be a bit granular. I still haven't produced an ice cream with the smoothness that I was able to get from my old 1970s era Salton-put-it-in-the-freezer-while-it-mixes ice cream maker. I'll keep trying, but I'm disappointed. Plus, other than the metal lining for the freezer bowl, all the other pieces are plastic, so I have to wonder how long this thing will last."
1,Valued engineered to nothing,"I had the previous version and loved it, but I always was short ice cream for my 3 kids. So I decided to upgrade to the larger volume one. However, after my 3 run and making ice cream I just through it in the trash. They make this item so cheap that they might have even taken out too much of the silca. You will never get a full portion of ice cream as it doesn't have enough silca in it to freeze the ice cream. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,krup not worth the money,DO NOT recommend too much trouble...must freeze bowl in order to make a very small amount of cream. Has to be frozen 24 hours prior to making cream. Can only make one making then must refreeze for at least 24 hours. Can not just spontanously make ice cream when you would like.
5,easy to use,Krups ice-cream maker arrived quickly. It is easy to use and best of all the recipes are great. It was recommended by a friend and I am glad I took her advise.
4,I love it!!,I love this ice cream maker. It takes about 45 minutes & you have ice cream! Great way to end the evening after having a nice dinner.
5,One of the best modern naval technology magazines.,"Written in English, this is probably one of the best modern naval technology magazines, discussing technology, weapons, ships and includes sections in the back for brief world news and industry news."
1,DO NOT GET THIS EDITION,"NOTE: This is not a 1-star review for Emily Dickinson. She is one of the greatest poets of all time, and should be read by everyone who loves poetry (and even those who don't).That said, this is a terrible edition. I was shocked when I opened it in a bookstore, looking to show a friend one of her poems I had just been talking about, to discover that the punctuation had been completely modified. The meanings of some of her best poems hinge on varying interpretations of Dickinson's eccentric punctuation, and to change it seems to me one of the great crimes against poetry. I am especially disappointed because Modern Library normally puts out such excellent editions, but this one is just awful."
2,Sanitized Emily,"Emily Dickinson is a genius and great poet, but this isn't the way to experience her work. Dickinson's distinctive punctuation and capitalization are ""corrected""; the effect is maybe a smoother read but one far less rich in implications and possibilities. The division of the poems employed here , and in many of the older collections (""Life,"" ""Nature,"" ""Love,"" ""Time and Eternity"") are not Dickinson's, and are not very useful in experiencing the poems. In my opinion, this volume omits many of Emily's best poems and includes some of her least interesting/ daring. Of course, there can be many varying opinions as to what Emily's best work was, but since all of her poems are collected in one manageable volume there's no need to let someone else decide that for you. As another reviewer has said, the Johnson ""Complete Poems"" volume is what you want."
5,This is soooo great!,This is such a good collection of S&G's music. It's one of the few CD's that I love every single song. I am a new fan of their music and it really got me into it. The CD is just plain GREAT!
3,"Streaks, Glitter, but Pretty","I have a medium fair skin tone. This stuff streaked badly the first time I used it. However, I decided to keep going and hope for the best. I admit, the lotion did leave a lovely color, and the streaks eventually faded as I applied more color daily. Unfortunately, it left severe dark patches under my bicep area and thighs, where my skin is lightest. I have had to wait for this stuff to wash off, because I'm tired of looking like a leper. That's another thing: don't expect the color to last very long. I could almost watch it wash away each time I took a shower. The glitter disappears after a day, and the color fades significantly after 2-3 days. It gets three stars for the color, because that has been hard for me to find. But I'm moving on to my next sunless tanner..."
3,Too much perfume!,"I like the kind of glow this tanner gives, and yes, it's wonderful that it's tinted so you can actually see where you are putting the cream so you don't miss spots, but I do find this tanning lotion to be a bit overpowering in the smell department. I have used Famous Dave's Moisture Tan and like it BUT the only problem with that one is it is not tinted so if you miss a spot or two during the application, you will only see the mistake the next day."
1,Sucks,"The old formula back in the day, say sometime around 2005 was great- It never streaked and looked pretty natural-This stuff glitters and streaks and looks fake as the day is long. It also wears off in flakes and looks worse and worse as time goes on. I suspect this has to do with it having Vitamin E in it which causes skin to exfoliate.. Exfoliate before you tan, not after! I am about as pale as you can get, think Nicole Kidman or perhaps paler,ha-- I recommend Banana Boat Deep.. blend with a fragrance free body lotion and the results are great."
3,ONLY WATCH IF YOUR A UFC FAN,THIS MOVIE IS WORTH A WATCH IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE UFC. THE ACTING IS HORRIBLE. IT IS KIND OF FUNNY TO SEE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE UFC STARS TRY ACTING. STORY IS KIND OF COOL IF THE ACTING WAS BETTER. IF I WAS IN THE RING WITH THIS HECTOR ECHAVARIA CLOWN HE WOULD TAKE A SERIOUS BEATDOWN.
1,really really bad bad movie....even for a UFC fan,"How can a movie with all these great UFC fighters stink so bad I'd rate it one star? The plot is stupid....a bad take on a much better movie with Stone Cold Steve Austin ""The Condemned"" and the UFC guys are barely on screen..I mean blink and they are gone...what we have left is unknown hack actors with cheesy dialog and UGLY naked women...blech...and I bought the blu ray so I had to watch this mess in Hi-def....let me spare you the same waste of an hour and a half."
4,A must-have for any Adept,"This book is one of the classics of the Rennaissance hermetic tradition. It tells the story of Christian Rosencreutz who travels to a distant castle to attend a royal wedding but there is more to the story than meets the eye. Since it is a book on alchemy, it overflows with symbolism. It may be beneficial to read the book together with Rudolf Steiner's commentary. Since the book was first published in 1616, it may be very helpful for a student of Renaissance - the beginning of the seventeenth century is exactly the time when modern science is not born yet but is already clearly on its way...."
3,Precious Prayers,"This book contains prayers in rhyme. They include prayers about being kind, good and loving, and some about friends, promises and thanksgiving. These are classic prayers, and yet I cannot say that I have ever heard them before. My two preschool sons are far too restless to sit through these poems; however, the bunnies are darling throughout the book."
2,Dripping,I am having a problem with the nectar dripping constantly from the feeding tube. By the end of the day all the nectar has dripped out. Is there a solution from anyone else who has encountered this problem. Thank You.
2,Artsy but drippy!,Very artsy and decorative but we've tried everything...even a BB in the stem and it STILL drips. Can't find a webpage for the manufacturer to get help...so buyer beware. Buy as decoration not a feeder!
3,Book for academic world,"This book is more for students who wants to learn the relational database theory. It's important to know the fundamentals, and this book shows all theory. Otherside, if you work in the database real world, this book is very hard to read and booring. If Chris Date puts more real world examples the book would be a five stars. I don't use this book for a quick reference in my work, but if i want to learn o remember more about a concept, then i use it."
4,Suitable for Students of NCC Advanced Diploma in Com Science,"After several years lecturing. I finally found a book which matches the Software environment Module of the NCC Advance diploma in Computer Science (UK). It not only matches the syllabus, but also give in-depth information of all the topics covered in the NCC notes. I have recommended the book to hundreds of students of my class, but they are not available currently. They do not stay long on our shlves here, in Mauritius, as our University students use it also."
1,"Scholarly, but of little value (to me)","The book is (was) considered a classic, so I decided to read it.I have about 10 years data base experience. I'm not a hard core DB developer, but I've seen my share of databases and written a fair amount of complex SQL code.I wanted to learn more of the fundamentals and theory of database architecture and design.I found the book painful to read and got little out of it. I would have been sad to have had this as a college text book. Its not thats its theoretical, I just got nothing out of it. There are other database design books I found much more interesting.I will instead read a broad range of database design books based on some of the reviews here on Amazon."
1,"good for academia, bad for the rest of the world...","I also started reading this book with hopes of discovering the ""bible"" that everyone was raving about. After struggling with the first three chapters I came to realize that Date is a ""genius"" who simply cannot construct a simple, intelligible sentence! I'm sure the author is ""brilliant"" and that this work is a ""masterpiece,"" but frankly, people who can't write simply shouldn't be published! Not at all recommended."
1,When English is a set theory,I cannot believe so many people gave this book such high ratings.Date has no clue on writing structured English. The man has more than 4 clauses per sentence and this is not including the clauses in the brackets.Publishers need to pay more attention when editing.Only logically conclusion is that Date thinks in SQL and hence his English looks like SQL.Waste of money.
1,Absolutely awful,"This is an absolutely horrible book. It is in NO WAY an ""Introduction"". I found that the text is so dense that I can only read for 10 minutes at a time. I have learned nothing from my readings except that I can't stand the way Date writes.I bought the book because it is required reading for my Database Specifications class. I am returning it and will purchase an alternate book."
1,Not good at all,"This book is impossible to read, and uses way too many buzzwords. Like why can't we call a record a record (Date insists calling it a tuple or relvar)?Knowing these terms is very important, but the direction of computers is toward the average user. And not to those that construct sentences only to sound smarter then others (which many who love Date also love doing).My suggestion: avoid this book as if it were the plague."
1,Get your coffee ready...,"This has to be one of the dryest books I have ever come across. It is a constant struggle to stay awake. The book pretty much consists of the author trying make everything sound technical when, honestly, there isn't all that much substance to back him up. This book probably can be condensed into about 100 pages and be far more interesting. Maybe you can survive this book if you find it interesting just to throw technical jargon around, but for anyone interested in applying your knowledge to real-world applications, this book will in no way help you."
5,PERFECT SIZE !,"This dresser was an absolutely perfect size for our spare bedroom. It is very well constructed, drawers open very easily and it looks great! I do recommend this dresser."
3,Beckett Baseball Card Price Guide #25,"The new layout for the index is very frustrating and not even complete. The last part of the index has been left off. Also, found there are some key sets that aren't listed, such as Donruss Preferred, Topps Gold and many of the Pinnacle sets. They also failed to include some insert sets for key brands. I know this is a hugh undertaking, but they already have the information on their web site...for an additional charge. Despite all the problems, it is still the best price guide on the market. Just hope they do a better job on #26."
3,Map 'n go,Map and go is a a smaller version of Delorme's street atlas- If you need to get a detailed printout of any or all of your maps Street Atlas is the way to go. Map n go is just the cheaper smaller version.
2,Disappointed,"This is the first time over a number of years that I have been disappointed in the purchase of a book. The cover of the book had big creases in it and the corner of the book cover was turned up. There was also writing on the inside. I always select a book in ""good"" or ""very good"" condition and this was my first disappointment."
3,the title track was cold,"this Brother use to crack me up back in the day.the title track pre-dated Jerry springer&it was a trip.Richard dimples Fields&His Lady named Sadie was a trip. Richard""dimples"" Fields&Betty Wright turned out ""she's got Papers on Me"".that song use to have me rolling,but at the same time I knew it meant half&half.""Don't Ever take your Love"" was the cut as well.the cover cuts were aight.but His main jams always were on point&kept me rolling."
5,Fire Within,"Fire Within presents a sensitive and critical rereading and reconstruction of the stories of four women in the early church: Tabitha(Dorcas), Lydia, and Priscilla as they are presented in the Acts of the Apostles, and Phoebe as she is mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans. The book highlights their spirituality and explores their experiences and missionary activities in the light of the challenges posed to church and society by third-world women today. The chapters not only discuss the lives of these women disciples but draw our attention to the all-too-similar experiences of discrimination, prejudice, injustice, and oppression which form a disturbing and poignant parallelism between these biblical women and their sisters today. As a way of deepening the reader's spirituality and Christian commitment, each chapter also includes suggestions for prayer and reflection as well as for Christian praxis. -- from book's back cover"
3,It charmed me in spite of itself,"You could say ""jejune"". You could say ""banal"". I suppose you could even say ""insipid"". But despite that, I remain charmed by this film. It's a silly, little, romantic comedy that's been done many times before, yet it works again. I've watched it more than once which for me is a true test. I like to fall asleep with it playing, not because it's inherently dull; rather, because the feelings it provokes are soft, and warm, and pleasant. I can drift off knowing that all ends well; and really, sometimes that's all I need."
1,WRITER'S BLOCK,"I can see it all now: a screen writer with a deadline facing a blank page.... All of a sudden - IDEA! - ""I'll write a screen play about 'writer's block'! I'll just change it to be writer's block about writing a book, not writer's block about writing a screenplay. I'll just put in any stupid plot idea that pops into my head, a French woman and a Swedish woman, no, make that a German woman, with stupid names too, let's see - 'Ylva' - that's a good one... and nobody will catch on. The audience is too dumb to notice anything like that. And then I'll see if I can sell it to some sucker in Hollywood who wants to try something 'different'.... If they just get two good-looking young actors as leads... wow, I'll make a million!"""
1,This is literally,"the worst movie I have ever seen. There was nothing good about it - bad plot, bad acting... buy something else if you ask me."
3,lovely,low-key but enjoyable. a little more like real life than most films of its type. i enjoyed the interweaving of the two realities... good music.
1,One Terrible Movie,This movie has got to be the worst movie of 2003--the acting is terrible - the movie is slow and boring--I only saw it because it was the movie being shown during my air flight to Hawaii and the 2 yr old kid in the seat behind me was crying loud and screaming during the 5 hr flight and I needed the ear phones to drown it out--My question is: Who ever thought that Kate Hudson could act? She has got to be one of the worse actors around--no emotion-no thought-whatever-she is the same in every movie I have seen her in--terrible--My suggestion is avoid this movie at all costs-even for rental-you will be glad you did.
1,A BIG FAT DUD,"ALEX & EMMA (Warner) Kate Hudson's back (see; How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days) this time with Luke Wilson in what is billed as a romantic comedy. Sadly, it is neither. Life's short enough. Don't waste it on bad movies. Send your ticket stub to Rob Reiner and ask for your money back. On second thought, maybe it should be a class action thing."
5,Suprising,"I'm suprised that so many people gave this movie a bad review. My boyfriend took me to see it because I had mentioned I wanted to go, and when he and I came out we both loved it!! It was fabulously written, Kate and Luke have great chemistry together, and we never even saw the ending coming.I can't wait for it to come out finally!! I've been waiting MONTHS since I saw it in the theatre for it to be released!!"
5,Great Date Movie!,"This movie had everything that makes a great ""date"" movie. There is comedy, romance, and a happy ending. Not to mention that the guys will love Kate Hudson and who could not like Luke Wilson?"
2,Not Great,"Ok so they try something different and it didn't work. The idea was ok, but could of been better, two star's for having Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson playing two different characters in this weak plot.Enjoy!!"
2,Cute,"It was slow, but for some reason I really liked the movie. I thought the plot was a bit bland, but creative at that. I thought the storyu was cute, and always predictable, but you must expect that in watching love stories. The charisma was tight, and I liked it. I enjoy writing, and it is true that you write based on what others mean to you. Ahh...writer movies."
1,good actors bad story,"I usually enjoy romantic comedies but this one was pretty bad. I mean, a writer threatened by cuban loan sharks? So he hires a stenographer? Oh and they break his laptop so he can?!?! not finish his script and be able to pay him back? Or I know, a bad twist in a bad story to get him and Emma together.Save your time and go buy (or rent) something else. (It's not even worth a rental)"
3,Fluffy chick flick,"As a chick flick, it gets 4 stars; as `great theater,' it'd get one star. I'll give it an overall 3.Author Alex has gambled away most of the advance on his next romance novel and must produce a finished book in 30 days or the Cuban Mafia will drop him off his 4th floor balcony. But he's got writer's block. He hires reluctant court stenographer Emma (Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn clone and daughter) to type while he creates and dictates. The book, set in maybe the 30s, becomes a metaphor for real life, with, of course, romance between author and steno at the heart of it.There's no lesson here, no message, nothing deep at all. It's not great theater or great drama. It's just a cute little toss-off movie that my 89yo mother and 50yo sister would both love, a movie you could take your great auntie to."
1,Zzzzz,"Dear God! This movie was the absolute worst film I have ever seen. I love romantic comedies but this was neither romantic nor funny. Both characters were boring and the action was so slow, I thought my DVD player froze! The plot of the story remains unfufilled...What happened with the Cuban men who demanded the money? We never see them again! Instead the plot shifts over to something completely different. This movie is not worth your time, or money. If you aren't sleeping well, then by all means watch it, you will fall into a deep sleep within the first fifteen minutes."
4,love the storyline!,"This was a cute movie! I loved the storyline and how the romance was taking place in his story and real life at the same time. Very cute story idea, a great addition to my chick flick collection!"
3,"Capsule review for ""Alex & Emma""","Surprisingly OK romantic comedy. I found it while zapping between movie channels, and watched it from beggining to end, with commercials in between. The device to tell the story is interesting (writer and typist share the creative process during 30 days). In more capable hands, we could be talking about a classic. As it is, ""Alex & Emma"" stands as a cute comedy for those hours when our brain can forgive such guilty pleasures."
3,One Dimensional and Simplistic... Undeniably Fun,"If you're looking to view a great rom com in the vein of ""Kate and Leopold"" ""The Holiday"" or ""You've Got Mail"" by all means, avoid this film. If you're looking for a semi-fun way to spend an hour and a half, look no further. ""Alex and Emma"" is basically a formulatic screenplay with very little improvisation or creativity put directly to screen by very good leads. There's not much at work in this movie... but what's there is is charming, funny and sweet most of the time."
1,One of the all time worst!,This movie was agonizing to watch. The seconds just dragged by. I have loved Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson in other movies! This movie was just a very bad choice for them.The writing and acting was abominable. The plot line was dull and boring.
2,Star Wattage Blows a Fuse,"""Alex and Emma"" proves once again that without a good script, a movie has no chance of succeeding. Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson have been effective in the past but here they have a timid,pale wanna be romantic comedy script that even the best and more expereienced screen comedian actors would be hard pressed to turn into something palatable.Kate Hudson has a couple of good scenes and Wilson continues his performance streak of loop-da-loop, likable characters. But this does not add up to a movie, sorry to say. And Rob Reiner: what were you thinking?"
2,The poor reviews are right!,"This was a choppy story with no romance. It seemed to employ about every formula joke and situation for such a romantic comedy, some of which were cute at best. But none of it came together to make it special. The weak plodding story and the weak characters made this movie a bore. The trailer shows the best parts.I asked my 16 year old daughter if she would recommend it to her friends, and her response was, ""Only if they didn't have anything else to do..."""
1,bad,note to rob riener the best plots don't work. if you've seen the previews you've seen all the great scenes and all you get is a slow as mollasses movie with bad plotting and it's predictable. i admit i fell asleep through it twice. the ending was the only good scene. i want my money back.
3,the last act,"If you can stay with this film to the Third Act, you'll be rewarded with a sweet love story. The first two thirds, however, are sadly trite. Kate Hudson has been so watered down in appearance and personality - she screams ""bland."" And Luke Wilson's narrative is toneless and flat. It's very frustrating because I love both of these actors, and it's sad to watch them drown in bad material. But just as I was about to turn away from this formulaic film, I was suprised by the last 20 minutes of it. Suddenly, a beautiful love story emerged, a love triangle that captured my interest and made me feel for these characters. With such a satisfying ending, I was left wondering why the rest of the film hadn't been as well crafted. It's like everything went into the last act of this story, leaving the audience and the actors floundering for far too long. If only the same care for the ending had gone into the beginning and the middle of the piece, it would have been a very satisfying film. It's a pity."
4,I didn't think I'd like this movie this much...,"This film is so romantic and great. It's on my top 10 list of most romantic romance comedy movies. Kate's character is most likeable. Her acting is way better then in her acting in previous other movies I saw her in. If you like romantic comedy movies give this a try, but if I were you, I'd rent it or something before you decide to actually buy it. I'm sorry if this review wasn't helpful."
2,Kate Hudson is the cute all-American girl-next door type,"albeit with an attitude. She's stuck in a way too predictible formula comedy. All that is left is the particulars. A novelist, Alex is under fire, literally to produce a novel quickly to get the money to pay off loan sharks who want to kill him. He hires steno, Emma & she moves almost literally into his life as he begins to crank out a novel; with her critical comments along the way. It is soon obvious that the novel is paralleling their going relationship. Yes, of course, they are falling in love.The movie flashes between the present day & the 1920's Gatsby-like setting of the novel. The problem is they are all too aware that this is happening. That they know that this is causes the movie to lose much of the charm it could have had if the two stories proceeded with Emma & Alex blithely ignorant of what was happening. Art imitates life. Or is it life imitates art? I could squeeze 21/2 stars."
2,Tepid Bore,"Riddle me this: How can Kate Hudson release about 5 films a year, all of which flop badly, yet she's still superfamous and getting roles in more and more movies, that just keep getting worse and worse. I just don't get it. If there's anyone who qualifies as ""Boxoffice Poison"" these days, it's Miss Hudson.This is the same as about 15 of the other flicks she's released since ""Almost Famous"": formulatic junk that is barely tolerable. Boring, slow, you just can't stand it. I keep giving her a chance, but I think this flop is the final straw. Stay away at all costs. I can't understand why this chick's terrible films keep getting all this hype. They NEVER come through at all, they are always worse than the last flop she did. It can't just be that she's Goldie Hawn's daughter. Maybe she sold her soul to Satan or something (I hope not). Maybe she will just make any film and is cheap to hire, who knows."
2,Trite and...,"BORING. I was convinced to watch a sweet romantic comedy with my wife, but even she was disappointed by this slow-moving wreckage of a movie. The basic plot facts are that an author named Alex (Luke Wilson) has 30 days to write a novel or his loan sharks will kill him. The said loan sharks have also added some difficulty to his task by burning his computer (insert your ""frying the hard drive"" joke here) over the stove burner.So...in comes cute and perky Emma (Kate Hudson) as a stenographer to take notes for Luke since he apparently doesn't know how to write with a pencil. The story ends up reflecting Alex's real life, as he falls for Emma but still has feelings for a more glamorous woman.In short, the story moves so slowly I wanted to stick a cattle prod into the TV, and there were so many formulaic and predictable twists, my eyes are still rolled into the back of my head.Unless you are a big fan of either of the main characters, I advise you to keep your distance from this movie."
3,A little disappointing,"I thought that this book would be as great as its adult emergency partner of the same series, however, eventhough it contains some good information , I have not actually found the need to consult it in the shift. The knowledge in it is not too bad, but not as helpful as I thought when I decided to buy it initially. It is ok , not a bad item to have, but if you don't, you won't miss it."
2,Not a great primary care reference,"A great fan of the Pocket Pharmacopoeia, Pediatric Emergency Handbook, Critical Care/Internal Medicine handbook, I was really looking forward to a concise orthopedic handbook for my primary care practice.Unfortunately, Tarascon's Pocket Orthopaedica is really better suited to an orthopedist (or at least an orthopedist in training).Too much detail about orthopedic anatomy and surgical procedures and less about general diagnosis and management of common orthodic PROBLEMS.I don't anticipate that I'll ever find a use for this book."
4,pocket reference,"All aspects of this product's ordering experience were superb, except one. Namely, I don't use the item requested as often as I thought I might."
5,good,A very good purchase. It was bought for my oldest daughter's birthday and i know she will be delighted to receive it.
3,"Right item, horrible shipping","I ordered the right item, at a really good price. But for some reason, it took over a month AND a re-shipment in order to get this item. I like the item, but the company needs to buck-up on their shipping policies"
3,Not so bad,"Obviously you can't go to this movie expecting an Oscar caliber film. However, if you go simply to be entertained for a couple hours, you won't be disappointed. I took my younger cousin and thought it was a very sweet and enjoyable film. There are several inneundos and jokes that only the older people accompanying the young girls in the audience will get. Julia Stiles and Luke Mably were good together and made you want to root for them. Worth the price of a ticket....and this coming from a mature, professional 26 year old."
3,UpDated Fairy Tale,For the most part I really enjoyed the movie. Julia Stiles who plays a college student who wants to be a medical doctor and lets nothing stand in her way. That is until she meets the very spoiled but handsome Danish prince played by Luke Mably who is terrific in this movie. But my fave was Ben Miller who playes Soren who has the unpleasant task of looking after the prince. While I like that is wasn't a typical ending. Ending could be better.
2,Predictable Formula Movie,"It was entertaining, with fairy tale predictablity. Julia Stiles did a fine job. But there were a number of flaws. How could Julia Stiles get picked out of the crowd by everyone when she first goes to Denmark and then later at the Princes' coronation as the new King, after she's been there a few weeks, she can just slip away in the crowd and nobody even notices her? Rental = YES. Add it to your DVD collection = NO"
3,Ok,"I enjoyed it, but the end was kind of corny. Mabley and Stiles are cute together. It works. I wish sex wasn't discussed the way it was so it would have been more appropriate for a younger audience."
2,average.,"I love to watch fair tale/ugle ducking becomes a princess movies. However, this movie is a flop to me. First, the actor is younger than the actress. second, the actor is much more beautiful than the actress. The two could play an older sister with her younger brother. I just cannot image the two could be together. They don't look like a match made by heaven. Also, I don't see how Eddie started to fall in love with Morgan. The two lack chemstry. All fair tale are made up, but this one is especially not believeable.I like A Cinderella Story much better than this one."
1,Make Up Your Minds!!!,I thought okay this movie might be okay. Boy was I wrong. In this movie the normal girl meets the normal boy who turns out to be a prince in disguse. They can't make up thier minds if they want to be together or not. (breaking up at least 4 times in this movie) It totally bored me so good luck if you liked it.
2,Three out of one and more coming,"I first saw this on an international flight quite a few years ago and found it quite entertaining for the captive audience. Now I find it has been split up into several ""sequels"" that seem to have lost something along the way. I'm not going to bother with the next one ""Princess on an Elephant Hunt""."
4,A charming modern fairy tale for kids,"For a made-for-TV movie, this movie is pretty good. Both Julia Stiles and Luke Malby convey the right mix of seriousness and levity that the story demands. The story itself is a plausible revamping of classic cinderella/Anna and the King fairy tale.Don't both with the sequels - they're not worth your time."
5,"This movie is the ""Pretty Woman"" for today.*","Excellent movie!* I can only say it reminded me of another great one- Pretty Woman. Finally- someone has recaptured the theme of that great one.* (And funny the actress in both are really named Julia.*)Julia Stiles again shines-a true talent. (As she also did in Mona Lisa Smile*- -with by the way, my all time favorite actress, Julia Roberts*)This was a fantastic movie all the way around.*Thank you all* who made it come to life.*(And keep up the good work... there are those of us out here who love it.*)"
5,Excelent,"I am very satisfied with the product, it arrived before the time expected and I proved that it was in great shape."
1,"This movie is under-rated, stupid, and boring!","Don't wast your money on this movie. ""Paige"" goes to college and meets this guy who's like, ""Oh lift up your top"" then for some reason they fall in love then she finds out he's a prince and so she gets mad and they keep on breaking up and getting back together again! It's under-rated because there is one sexual scene. This movie is rated PG!It should be PG 13! It's also so annoying becuase they keep making out! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!"
4,Just a nice movie,"I saw a sneak preview of this film over the weekend. I loved it (but I love romantic stories). I just love Julia Stiles. She is wonderful actress to watch. This is a good film to see with your girlfriends. If you just want to spend about 2hrs just enjoying yourself (and not having to think), you could go see this film."
5,Happily Surprised,"I was expecting a fairly superficial movie that was mildly fun. But after the scene in the laundry room, the movie suddenly shows a lot of depth. The two leads really pull off that this is a real, deep--even a bit selfless--love going on here. The movie even deals a bit with the real problems involved in such a relationship. But, what I really liked was that each person (Paige and Eddie) was the better for knowing the other. They grew each other up into better people. Most romance movies don't have that at all."
5,A Young Girl's Dream Come True,"I downloaded this on a whim looking for another romantic comedy and glad I did. Some may say it's sappy but I think that's the point. It was fun and in many ways typical of real life in college life and small towns. Royalty doesn't mean much if you can't do the real dirty work and understand the plite of the ' little ' people. I do wish that they had used the original cast in the sequels: Julia Stiles (whom I've always loved as an actress), Luke Mably (more believable as a prince to become king), Ben Miller (always a pleasure to watch) They had a chemistry together and were more believable. All in all a good film for all to watch."
5,Julia Stiles Shines!,"In this romantic comedy about the daughter of a Dairy farmer and the Prince of Denmark who will one day be King. The couple meet when Edward comes to the US to go to college... and that is where the fun begins. He is paired with Julia as a Chemistry Lab Partner and he's almost constantly late for Labs.If you liked Julia in ""Save The Last Dance""... you'll love her in this film. It was one I thoroughly enjoyed and have watched again and again.Hopefully, you will too!"
2,Why was this movie set in Wisconsin?,"I usually like romantic comedies, but this one was for the birds. Maybe the robin, our state bird here in Wisconsin. Then again, maybe not, since this movie seemed to get ALL the Wisconsin stuff wrong.People outside on Thanksgiving in just long sleeves? Not where I live. I mean, they could have chosen from about ten other midwestern states if all they wanted was that 'naive farm girl meets big-city boy' feel (which is lame and predictable, by the way).I like Julia Stiles, and the young man was okay, but getting the local stuff wrong was a turnoff, and it really kind of took me out of the movie.Tsk tsk."
3,Cute,"Prince is a cute movie, but it is way too predictable. The ending is not at all original. It's really a mediocre romantic movie with nothing special to it."
1,NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!!!!!!,"Me and my mom were exited to see this movie at first but as we got farther into the movie we sooner or later left.It was such a shock that the price turned out to only be interested in topless girls And even asks one the girls in a bar to take her shirt off for him.Me and my mom bursted out of the theater and got her money back.Me and my mom had thought we had just veiwed half of a PG-13.if you think this movie would be cute for your daughter at her b-day or just a great family movie,WELL THINK AGAIN SISTER!!!"
1,See below I cannot play this DVD on my DVD player,"I cannot review this DVD as I cannot play it on myDVD player. It comes up as ""Amend Regional Code"".I cannot play a DVD under Reginal Code - how do i amend it?As it is it of no use to me I should be sent another copy.Sorry I have not reviewed this earlier but i only returned fromL.A. last Tuesday."
5,I thought it was great!,"I thought that the movie was a great one. It took a while to get going but when the ball got rolling, it kept rolling. At the end you think you have it figured out but then it takes a turn for the worst and you think it might end so you get upset. But then it all works out. So I think it was a great movie because any movie where you can predict the ending just isn't a good movie to start with."
3,Cute and clean,"It was appropriate to watch with my 11 and 13 year old nieces, which is what I was looking for."
4,Copenhagen Nostalgia,"I think one of the reasons I really like this movie is because Copenhagen is one of my favorite cities in the world and there are some really nice shots of Rosenberg Castle and the city. The movie also goes a little more in depth with the relationship then most Romantic Comedies do, dealing with issues like how the family reacts, life after the relationship begins, etc. Worth your time."
2,People Actually LIke This?,"I can't believe how many good reviews this movie has gotten on Amazon. The acting is terrible. The storyline is absurd. The ending is extra absurd. I can do a predictable fairytale love story, but this was terribly done. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that there are actually movies that are worse and it's not THE worst movie I've seen. But again, it's not a good movie."
5,Mountain of Spices,"I love this book. I have trouble with memorazation. This book keeps my interest. It s very easy to read. I like that.It is an allegory in christian form. There is a girl named named ""Grace and Glory"". She was formerly ""Much Afraid"" in the book ""Hinds feet on high places"" which I would recommend also. Anyway in the book ""Mountain of Spices"" she helps her relatives- to follw the good shepherd-Jesus and get to the ""high place""I am not positive what that is. It could be heaven- or to be saved.it s very enjoyable reading. it is fun reading. Not boring or authoritative. Think of a book like ""Nancy Drew by carolyn Keen- It is fun, easy reading like that.The author of ""Mountain of spices is Hannah Hurnard.Ths was a paperback. It did not cost much."
4,A Spicey title,I bought the book because I love the spices of the world...the entire world....That was the hook.Enjoyable and thought provoking. I liked the visuals that it created in my head.
4,Great sequel!,"This book is a great sequel to the book by the same author, Hinds Feet On High Places. It's a must follow up!"
5,We Are Family,"Fresh out of law school Sash is ready to take on the world as well as be a sister/mother to her five year old brother Sweet. We know the best laid plans of men and women go astray. As Sash plans crumple in front of her face, she finds she has to trust the powerful, rich, handsome, and cocky Brandon Plain.Brandon and Sash's inability to trust each other hampers their ability to work together thus causing more problems. When they stop thinking of themselves and realize other lives are involved, they see good results on the horizon. As in life another monkey wrench is thrown in the mix. The pain for Brandon and Sash is over bearing. There were sections in the book where I found myself saying oh no, or damn; my facial expressions went through some heavy changes as I read Sweet Sacrifice.Ms Rhodes has done a stupendous job of keeping you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see if the characters can become a family.Reviewed by Toni Bonita, APOOO BookClub"
4,A study of Behind the Scenes Hollywood in the 1930's.,"One of Natalie Wood's best performances in the role of Daisy Clover, a young woman who discovers that fame and fortune in Hollywood doesn't come without a price. Superb supporting performances by Ruth Gordon as Daisy's hapless mother, Robert Redford as her movie star boyfriend whose true lifestyle is in the closet, Christopher Plummer as the CEO of the movie studio; Katherine Bard as his frustrated, lonely wife, and Roddy McDowall as a studio Executive Assistant. For the film buff, some excellent shots around the backlots and stages of Warner Bros. Pictures, doubling for the story's ""Swan Studios."""
5,inside daisy clover,i had searched everywhere for this movie and finally found it. I love it! Thanks amazon!
5,MISS CASTING,The Natalie Wood was miss cast for this role she.The Katharine Bard appears to be far to old for the role of Raymond Swan I think this was why she was ignored.I did not enjoy Robert Redford performance I found it lack creditability.I really enjoyed Christopher Plummer he showed more than one side to the character. He showed a caring side and also showed the double standard side. Why did he not get A Golden Globe nomination.Linda Colliver
2,Above Daisy Clover,"This film, about the struggle of a young star movie to mantain her personality against Hollywood cruelty, will probably gives you a headache (and not a ""HEARTACHE!, as it says one character), as it fastly turns on a bombastic, hopelessly phony melodrama.The problem around ""Inside Daisy Clover"" is its superficiality, that makes its characters a little more than mere caricatures. It has good moments, really fascinating ideas, but the general tone is fastidiously icy.Natalie Wood, performing a young talent (such a mix among Judy Garland and herself), gives an often exaggerated performance. However, she's always a lovely presence."
4,Inside Daisy Clover,"My infatuation with Natalie Wood continued. I saw this movie three weekends in a row. Natalie plays a young star disillusioned by fame and love. Robert Redford co-stars. Natalie's relationship with husband Robert Wagner was unique. They married young, divorced, married other people, divorced them, remarried and had a daughter. Natalie drowned in 1981 when she fell off a boat. She had a fear of water."
3,A mild romp with a cynical view of hollywood.,"This film has some of the look and feel of others of the day- ""Mad, Mad World"", and ""The Great Race."" But while the colors are bright the message is about the way the Hollywood studio system can chew young stars right up. All the characters are conflicted. It's ""Suddely Last Summer"" meets ""The Sound of Music."" And Plummer is especially hateful. Ever wonder why Redford's character is so cruel to Daisy in this one?"
5,Five Stars are not enough!,"It's always amazed me that this movie doesn't get more respect--sure it's campy but the performances are fantastic: Christopher Plummer's speech to Daisy by the pool after she's been abandoned by her new husband (a super young Robert Redford playing gay for God's sake--what more could a person ask?) is stunning and Natalie Wood's breakdown in the sound booth is incredible. Roddy McDowell's snarky secretary! Redford getting off lines like ""Good night, sweet, sad, lonely lady"" and Malora (great name) screaming at Daisy ""I'VE GOT A HEARTACHE!!!"" The gorgeous black and white video of Daisy singing and bouncing her way through the galaxies. All incredible stuff--why isn't this on DVD yet? Same goes for another Hollywood classic: Joan Didion's ""Play It As It Lays"" with Tuesday Weld and Tony Perkins. Wake up, Hollywood, and give us these treasures on DVD!"
3,"Good, But Not Wood's Best","I watched this because I'm a huge fan of Natalie Wood. Overall I did like it, but it wasn't her best. Some of the movie dragged but the ending was really awesome!"
3,natalie wood,One of Natalie's early films.....dated but if you are a fan you will love it. Robert Redford a plus as he plays a very different role than he would today.
2,Sandra D Rates The Classics,"Although I am a true admirer of Natalie Wood, I do believe that this movie diminishes her amazing talent. She was in her mid-to-late twenties when she decided to play the unfortunate, child-star, typecast role. As an adult actress, she should have declined the role of a young teenager in this movie. It was poorly written and not interesting -- to say the least. Love Natalie Wood, but dislike the movie."
4,imitating moves,I wish the Tai Chi moves of the models had been filmed behind them to make imitation easier.Having to reverse sides from watching movements in order to follow the instructions one is hearing is difficult.
4,Chi Energy Workouts for Beginners,"I felt this was a good workout not only for beginners, but seniors as well. In addition to the benefit of the workout, the program had an overall calming effect on the senses. The program was easy to follow, the directions explicit and clear as well as the demonstrations of each position and the movement. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it."
4,chi energy workouts for beginners,liked it had it on vhs and couldn't view it any more had degraded so was time to replace with dvd
3,Good but dated,"This video is good for beginners, but its very dated and the background is unpleasant to the eye in my opinion. Nonetheless it gets the job done."
4,Excellent Feeder.,"I like this feeder very much because it's heavy blown glass that is colored red - no plastic, and you don't have to add red coloring to the nectar. Also, it hangs at a very natural angle, so the hummingbirds get the hang of it quickly. Shortcomings: it doesn't hold very much nectar. I would estimate it has a 1/3 cup capacity. So if you have alot of birds, you need to refill it every other day or so. Also, the rubber stopper is a little difficult to keep from popping out when the feeder is freshly refilled and the lip is wet. You have to dry it thoroughly to make it stay put. These shortcomings are only minor, and I'm very pleased with the product. I am planning to buy a couple more over time."
1,Another Godly Book,"This book was given to me by a relative in the hope that I'd clean up my act. Guess what! I didn't, the book made me gag. Thank you for trying to tell me God loves and to be a good little girl, but no thanks, a lot of the answers I rejected because they sucked. The answers on dating were stupid, and reaction to pre-marital sex was laughable. All in all, don't buy this book unless you're at gunpoint."
4,a valuable contribution,"This is a valuable contribution to the field of Chinese Buddhist studies. It contains important papers from leading Buddhologists such as Luis Gomez. Also, any article by Robert Gimello is worth reading, as he is an extraordinarily careful scholar. Unfortunately, the typeset is quite unattractive. Still, it is a great addition to any Sinological or Buddhological library."
4,They're GRRRREAT!,"These noodles are almost a carbon copy of a snack that we ate while on holiday in Hawaii. They make a chicken stock with chunks of chicken, carrot, peas, ect.. I was very happy to have found these. Try them if you can."
1,Very disapointing,"Thought this is Japan made and purchased at almost $25 for $2+ a pack, I had bought other brands in local stores for a lot cheaper, this is the worst bean thread I had so far. Wish I could return it. My experience with Amazon is always satisfied except when it came to grocery products. From now on I stop buying food online."
1,well-written self-indulgent tripe,"This book is genuinely mean-spirited. The author is full of her ""poor little gorgeous me"" self-pity, which she amplifies with cardboard characterizations of her unliked relatives and tiresome references to old movies - not that she brings any original insights to these.The great sin of this novel is that the writer/narrator sets herself up as a diva of pain. It takes a while for you to realize that everyone in the book except this woman is in pain. She it seems is thin, rich, happily married and scornful. All those around her are fair fodder for her cruelty. And while I daresay the childhood she describes was awful, her total lack of interest in anyone other than herself serves as an effective dampening to your pity.I'm a very non-critical reader and I love almost all books. I hated this."
5,power on the go,Although power is limited It easily runs the cooler (micro refrigerator) in motel rooms overnight and powers/charges anything that you might put into your car's cigar lighter when you don't have your car in the room with you.
2,The floppy sleep game,"I bought for my toddler but too complicated. May work with tweens and teens (perhaps adults, too)."
2,This book was not quite as advertised...,"It says the book is targeted for ages 3-10, but it uses mostly Baby Talk and preschool-level imagery, so it's definitely targeted to the Barney and Baby Bop set. My 10-year old rolled her eyes, and I agreed.I also grew weary of the self aggrandizing. It was a 320-page InfoMercial on how wonderful and succesful it was. <groan>This is a 'Tell Me What To Think' book, where everything is spoon fed, and everything is portrayed as being far simpler than it could possibly be in realityAnybody want my copy... cheap?The Floppy Sleep Game Book: A Proven 4- Week Plan to Get Your Child to Sleep"
1,I REALLY wanted this to work!,"I bought this book/CD with very high hopes. My 3 year old has had trouble going to sleep in his own bed and sleeping through the night for about 2 years. Every night, I lie down with him anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, or until I lose my patience. Then, when he finally does go to sleep, he still wakes at least 2 times duirng the night. My husband and I have tried everything. I was eager to try the Floppy Sleep Game with the movements and meditations. Our son is really quite mellow and I thought that these would be an effective way to get him ready for bed. On the contrary, he seemed MORE awake when we finished the exercises. It took even longer than normal to get him to sleep after listening to the CD each night. I'm glad that this has worked for some parents (I was really hoping to be one of them!). Alas, I will try something else. Good luck to all of you sleep deprived parents! :)"
4,Mini Eyes,"Just what we were looking for. Small, but powerful enough for our needs. Light and small for hiking or concerts.Good purchase."
5,Siegmund Nimsgern-yet another superb performance,"An all-star cast, but best of all, Siegmund Nimsgern as Kurvenal. Nimsgern is a superb Wagnerian bass-baritone, not to be missed, as well as the rest of this stellar cast. Buy!!!pwk"
2,"Ok light - a bit dull,a bit yellow 12-inch, 8-watt T5","I got this bulb for my Aqueon 15 gal column tank. A 12-inch bulb isn't easy to find, so I purchased this one and a Power-Glo to see which is brighter. I can only find T5 bulbs that are 8-watts, which isn't ideal as I want the tank BRIGHT. This bulb bulb is a much lower kelvin than the Power Glo, but the light looks very dull and a tad yellow once it is installed. It actually seems like it might be a bit dimmer than the original Aqueon bulb that the tank came with. Plants would probably do ok with it if they could tolerate medium light. Keep in mind my tank is very deep, so this review may not be a great qualifier for more standard shaped tanks where the light has less depth to penetrate.All that being said, it's hard to find 12"" bulbs and beggars can't be choosers (well, except in this case they can). If this was the only bulb I could get my hands on, it would probably suffice."
5,Perfect!,"I was surprised when my two wastebaskets arrived that they were larger than I had expected from looking at the photos (it helps to look at the dimensions first!) but they worked out just fine and I really like the look of them. They're sturdy, practical, and attractive."
2,Did not fit car,"Amazon suggested the parts would fit, not even close.Packaging is ""good"" with a nice box and a couple little things inside.The brakes looked to have copper strands in them to bind the ceramic material."
3,educational but a little boring,I was disappointed when this game arrived. It is a small box and consists of durable cards to learn from . There is a dice and it's very simple and a little boring. There is nothing very colorful or fun about it. I was hoping there would be a large poster or hardback game board with the map of the world but there is not so the kids have no reference for the countries. I had to get the globe out to play to show my kids what we were learning. The information on the cards is good but it is not a game I will recommend for young children.
4,Great educational game,"It is easy to play and you can't help learning something. It is a great way to review. I played the game with my 6 and 9 year old girls. Both enjoyed the game and want to play it again especially if I count it as part of school. Because the questions cover a great deal of material some subject we have not covered yet so it was a fun way to introduce new topics. After playing this game, I went on line to find out what other topics they covered. I was happy to find a great many different subjects."
4,Great way to learn about birds,"This game is a good way to learn about birds. Questions have varying degrees of difficulty which means younger kids can play along with their older siblings. Interesting facts, nice illustrations on the cards and a reasonable price make this a good purchase if your kids are interested in learning more about birds. Mine were; we played this game every day for two weeks straight and it still manages to find its way into our game rotation at least once a month."
4,Like the card game,This has been a good toy. My seven year old boy loves dinosaurs and knows so much about them. This game has taught him more and allows him to show-off how much he knows - which is far more than us grown-ups know about dinosaurs. I will buy other versions of this game.
2,If you're into birds...,"This comes in a small cardboard box. You have playing cards and a dice.(singular for dice is?)There are two levels, easy and hard.My son is six and an excellent reader so we were able to play this together. This isn't really for learning about birds. If you're a homeschool Mom per se, and you want a fun thing to add to a unit study or science class, this could work. Some of the birds aren't local to our area so that was interesting. My 6 year old answered some questions correctly which was actually very encouraging to him.The dice is to pick which of the 3 questions you'll ask the person, if they get it right, they keep the card, wrong, and you put the card at the bottom of the pile.It would take several game plays to get through all the questions.The cards are a heavy cardboard which is nice.If given the choice I would buy this again."
3,used book,"Bought this for a young friend of mine. The book was a little more used than I thought it would be, but still served the purpose."
1,Too good to be true,I was looking forward to the 24-pack of eggs. When my package arrived there was only 1 inside. I called Sam Ash and was told they would refund my money but could not send me 24 for the price listed by Amazon which was $1.49 + 4.99 shipping and handling.I was looking for a bargain and this one did not pan out. I would rather have had the eggs but was satisfied with the refund. I cannot believe the add is still online.
5,Marvelous transition from the '40s to swinging Capitol years,"If you don't listen to a lot of 1940s music, you may not appreciate the significance of this album (actually an expanded set built around Sinatra's landmark 'Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra' album from Columbia). This is a fun album, though, and Columbia's first-rate production is worth buying.'Saturday Night', the opening track, still sounds great. 'When You're Smiling' gets great orchestrations behind FS' great vocals. Of course, there were plenty of dumb songs around in 1950 -- 'The Hucklebuck' is inane, but even here Sinatra is strong, it's just that he is wasting his voice on a forgettable song. 'Farewell, Farewell to Love' and 'Lover' are nice, and 'All of Me' holds up well after half a century.Modern listeners who might find the (excellent) 1940s Columbia recordings kind of sappy will find this first 'swinging' Sinatra album to be more palatable. If you are a serious Frank fan, this is essential."
4,Young crooner becaming a mature swinger,"After Sinatra became a huge star with Tommy Dorsey orchestra, singing sickly sweet ballads of the 40-ies (which made him big star) he was looking for a way out of teenage pop and this album was his first attempt to show another, swinging style.Original album,recorded in 1950. was just 8 songs but on this CD there are 10 bonus tracks recorded with great forgotten arranger George Siravo - songs are happy, snappy and for the first time Frank Sinatra is not only ballad singer,he sound comfortable in uptempo material as ""Should I"" and ""It all depends on you"".This was just beggining, real masterpieces were coming on his way, but first he had to leave Columbia Records..."
4,not all that happy,"why the error of listing the numbers and including ""All Of Me"" twice?My only reason of purchasing this disc was to get The Hucklebuck which took me back 60 years.Long Live Sinatra!"
4,Healing Words,"For any that have experienced anxiety disorders, as well as those who have friends/family members who are dealing with it, this is a good read that will provides some insight into it as well as a message of hope for overcoming it.The account is told in first person and chronologically, giving the author's background and detailing the events that led up to the onset of the disorder and the steps taken over three decades to understand and overcome it. It offers hope for those who are currently struggling with their own 'beast' (the author's euphemism for the panic attacks and other anxiety symptoms).As someone who grew up with an anxiety disorder myself, I found it a fascinating read and helpful as well."
1,"A Hacked, quicky transfer","When I found out that all 26 episodes of the classic Jonny Quest were released on DVD I was stunned. I felt that finally the HB execs are getting it together and recognizing the good stuff. After watching the first two episodes I realized I had been DUPED! Editing dialogue to be PC, using the same ending credits for all episodes and no credit for Doug Wildey. A (...)release of the best classic prime-time animation of the 1960's.After I finish watching all the episodes, I'm donating the DVD's to my local public library. I know better now to read the reviews before buying. I think Warner Brothers and Hana-Barbera owe all of us an explanation for this hack-job. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DICK WITH IT?When I pay for DVD's, I expect the real deal without edits and deception. I can only hope that they fix it with another release with everything intact except the insert commercials. And you can bet they know that we will buy it again. Greedy, corporate pigs!(...)"
2,Still Not Complete After Such A Long Wait...,"The shows themselves rate five stars, of course. The two star rating is for the presentation, merited by the following:1. Dialogue edits from ""Pursuit of the Po-Ho""2. Dialogue edits from ""Monster In The Monastery""3. Atrocious, hack artwork on the box4. Cutting of JQ title cards from the introduction sequences5. Use of only one end credit sequence (the only one without creator Doug Wildey's name on it) for all 26 episodes6. Amping up the colors to an eye-straining saturation level7. Ridiculous modern extras; as a previous reviewer stated, they should've included pre-production artwork and/or Hoyt Curtin's musical cuesNever, never, never, NEVER trust a bunch of hamfisted, bottom-line watching suits to preserve something like this in the definitive, most complete way it should be. The Peter Principle is alive and well in every company big & small, and this set was spit out by one of the biggest. Keep those VHS copies handy..."
5,jonny quest,Brought back lots of wonderful memories and was able tointroduce it to my 8 yr. old son who absolutly loves it!Design of the jacket was beautiful also.
1,Not new,"This item was listed as ""new"" but upon receiving it, it is obvious it is not. I can see that inside the wrapping the corners are worn, the plastic casing is cracked in several places and places on the cover have color where color shouldn't be that has come off of something else (like splotches of silver over words on the back), which obviously couldn't happen if wrapped in the original wrapping. Very disappointed but it's a gift and don't have time to order a replacement."
3,i'll wait,"I was really excited that this was available, but after reading reviews that this has been edited, I'll wait....probably for a long time. I buy tons of WB dvd's but for some reason when it comes to cartoons, they just don't get it. Why not just print a disclaimer on the box about how it was a different time and blah blah blah?"
5,Fantastical Fun,Step back in time to witness adventure through the eyes of Johnny Quest. This dramatic but fun series genrated for kids captured many an adult who watched it. Filled with adventure and excitement this cartoon ranks right up there with landmark series like The Jetsons and The Flinstones. I thorougly enjoyed revisiting this wonderful series.
1,WHY??,"I was going to buy this. BUT, after reading the reviews here, and other forums, decided not to. AMAZON, please tell the producers that we want the ORIGINAL, UNCUT, UNEDITED version of Johnny Quest. Not this version, that for some reason, they felt they had to edit. It is a cartoon, just a cartoon, and they have to EDIT it? With all the explosions, and violence in todays cartoons. Really? When Johnny Quest is released in its ORIGINAL, PURE, UNCUT form, I will buy it.Sincerely,Quinn G. Blaylock"
1,thank God for the quality reviewers,"I couldn't believe it when I saw this boxed set for the nice price, holy cow! I really love this show, the artwork, etc., and I would love to own it, BUT for it to be edited and tampered with, missing title cards, missing credits, that just plain sucks. What's up with DVD makers not giving the fans what they want? It's like they need surveys for the obvious... Maybe every DVD maker oughta' put up a webpage explaining to the fans what they're doing every time they make a DVD, just to check to make sure they're getting it right... Jeez, how hard is it?All I can say is thank God for the quality reviewers. I'm passing on this 'til the DVD makers get it right."
2,Buyer beware...,"Disappointed to find that the Complete series on DVD has been ""edited for content"". Politically incorrect dialog has been removed or ""silenced"". I find it particularly offensive that one can watch an unedited episode on TV, but after spending $60.00 for a DVD to watch in the privacy of your own home, Turner/WB decide to remove 40 year old dialog from classic animation. Save your money and look for ""other"" collections of the same series."
1,Political Correctness,"Can someone please explain to me the difference between modern ""political correctness"" and the disappearance of Trotsky from old Soviet photographs?I loved this show as a child. I wanted to buy it for my son."
3,Jonny Quest,I cannot believe they censored this DVD. I am trying to decide if I should send it back. The political correctness of the United States has become unbelievable.
5,Fantastic In Every Way!!,"I've watched a handful of the episodes in this newly-released set and my opinion is that they are superb! The sound and picture are excellent, and I even like the box. This is Hanna-Barbera at its finest. The stories and characters are as interesting as I remember them being when these episodes first came out back in '64. Would the kids of today get into this stuff? Just ask my 13 year-old son who had to be pried away from the TV at bedtime. Buy it today!"
4,Like You Never Saw It!,"The most remarkable thing about this DVD set is that you get a full 25 minutes in each episode. I've watched the first 7 so far, and I thought I had seen them all a million times. But I hadn't.The thing is, when you see them rerun on TV, you see maybe 20 minutes - maybe less. Let's see, if we cut this episode to 19 minutes, we can add 2 more 30 second commercials.And what's more, most of those ""restored"" minutes have some of the best dialog and scenes that flesh out the characters.And finally, you get a cartoon you can show your son, that has guy characters doing guy stuff. As opposed to modern day role-reversal cartoons, where the guys get rescued by the girls, or there are no responsible male characters (don't get me started).I took away one star for the cheesy packaging - why can't they give you a decent box for these things? The episodes, of course, get five stars."
1,"Cropped, Cut, Keep It!",I've been waiting and hoping for a long time for Quest to come available on DVD. It's unfortunate that I will not be buying it! If you want my money you have to supply the real deal! UP YOURS!Jonny Quest - The Complete First Season
5,COOLEST CARTOON EVER!,"Having purchased this box set on a whim, I am glad I did! This set brings back great memories. It does however have a voice edit on the Ho-Po show. I believe however, that the person who thinks that the ""shadow of the Condor"" show was edited has mistaken this episode with ""The Dark Tower"". The Dark Tower has the scene that shows the Nazi soldier throwing a hand grenade at the Quest team from his plane when they are trapped on the side of the mountain. I don't recall a scene ever in""shadow of the condor"" that has the pilot throwing a grenade. I may be wrong but I believe this set is complete and unedited except for the voice editing on the Ho-Po showing.You wont be disappointed with this purchase. It will bring back many memories and is quite to fun to watch even as an adult after all these years. Get it you wont regret it!"
1,did not buy,"after reading that the originals were edited for political correctness, i decided that it's not worth it.maybe when they let a classic remain a classic..."
5,Great Value,Jonny Quest Was One Of My Favorite Cartoons As A Kid. If You Are An Adventure Cartoon Fan This Dvd Set Does Not Disapoint.
5,JQ,"I'm not old enough to have watched these during their original run but I did grow up before Cartoon Network had desolved completely into the mindless (and PC) mess it is today. Jonny Quest is still my favorite cartoon. I'm having a blast rewatching favorite episodes and I've ""found"" quite a few episodes that I've never seen before."
2,the title of this should be 'inanity.',"i'm not sure why everyone gave this cd such glowing reviews. it's not insane. it's not over the top. it's boring. it's trite. it sounds like messuggah. the vocals are annoying. darkane's first cd, ""rusted angel,"" was good. this is not."
5,A real mess,"The fabulous illustrations in this darling book delight small children, who have a way of making a mess of themselves, literally.Jessie loves messes. She's into crayons that color the edges of her paper and keep going--onto the table--and big red dots on her face and hands. She can't contain her yogurt in a cup; it spills.Her dad says, ""How about a carrot, my Messy Jessie? A carrot's not messy."" When he runs to answer the door, he comes back to find that she has dropped an egg on the floor, dumped out the milk, catsup and mustard, stepped in them, and is dancing about singing ""Messy Jessie!""The cat and dog lap up the mess, making footprints and pawprints all over the floor.""This isn't funny,"" says a dad losing patience.She takes a bath and goes to bed. ""I love you my Messy Jessie,"" says her dad.But she even dreams of messes. The message is real for children of a certain age.And of course, it's the dad who takes care of the messes.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,Beautiful Movie,"I had recently watched Alexa Vega in ""From Prada to Nada"" and I liked her acting. She is funny and believable. She and Luke Arnold did not disappoint me in this story. They played these rebel teenagers that get in trouble but what comes out of that is beautiful and inspiring music. Definitely a must see!"
4,Kept me interested til the end,"I'd recommend this movie to my friends and family. Beautifully done. Music is wonderful in this movie, sort of like in August Rush but with a totally different kind of story. I'd watch it again."
2,Not worth the money,I think this movie cost a little more than I've payed for better written movies.This might be a made for TV movie but I've even seen better one on TV. I will probably sell it on ebay.
3,Broken Hill,My husband spent 10 years of his youth in Australia and thought this was going to be a movie about mining or construction in the outback. He was disappointed to say the least. Good story though.
4,Good for first timers...,"I am new to Tai Chi. I was looking for an introductory DVD to learn from. I wanted this mostly for relaxation and stretching. The good news is I got exactly what I was looking for. I find it easy to follow. I agree with another reviewer that occasionally it would be helpful to have more shots of the performers feet, but it's only a few times. I found this relaxing and a good stress reliever. Even noticed I'm sleeping better."
4,New to Tai Chi,"This video good for beginners because it is easy to follow along with. The only issue I have is with the production(?) It is a bit too ""aquarian age"" for me. This would be natural given David Carridine's age at the time of filming. Other than that it is a nice ""doable"" Tai Chi routine,"
3,not what I expected,"I wasn't as pleased with this DVD as I thought I would be. I expected more from David Carradine. It is truly a begginers Tai Chi. I would like to have had no back ground music, and to have had more Tai chi!!!"
2,Woo Woo,"A Carradine vanity project. Here's a man in love with his own image. It's not a mainstream Tai Chi routine. Ponderous and slow moving. And I mean that in a bad (video) way, not a good (Tai Chi) way. Save your money and gaze at your own navel."
3,You'll need plenty of floor space.,"I think David Carradine's workout is really great, and the outfits aren't so silly in this video. However the one thing I find disappointing is the floor space required once you put all the moves together. Obviously, they practice in quite a large studio space, where ample floor space provides plenty of room to move around. I only have a small space in my living-room, and I quickly find myself running into furniture. The workout itself left me wanting a little more than was offered, but is more than adequate for beginners provided you have plenty of room in your workout area. I also think all the bonus extras of his life story in film & television, and his music is unnecessary and a bit self-involved. All that said, its still a pretty good buy, and I use it regularly."
4,Great exercise for the whole body and mind!,David's Tai Chi videos are great for the beginner and intermediate. They motivate as well and explain the exercies / movements in detail to make learning and following easy and enjoyable.
5,I love to sing!,"Great karaoke game. I really like the settings and the ability to create your own character, too."
1,Women falls in love with her rapist!,"The photography was lovely in the movie - but I was horrified at the ending. A women is raped, has a child from this crime and in the end falls for her rapist.This is a disgusting depiction of women."
5,One of Catherine Cookson's best,"This is an extremely moving story. I have the VHS. We need a DVD, Amazon !!!"
5,Highly Recommended RtI Resource,"As a college student, I found RtI to be overwhelming to research out of books and on the internet. This DVD covers everything with a straightforward, comprehensible presentation. The animated representations of concepts make things very easy to understand while the narration goes over the specific details. I'd recommend this for any college students preparing to become teachers. It will give them a good basic understanding of RtI BEFORE they enter the workplace."
4,A Nice Picture Refrence,"This book lists 670 species of bird, each one comes with a full color photograph and a paragraph describing where it can be found, its habitat, latin name, reproduction rates and other interesting facts. Birds are arranged by characteristics such as ""Divers and Grebes"" and ""Owls and Nightjars"". A solid and basic guide of a wide variety of birds from throughout the world."
3,Good Idea,I know these caps work well on engines that may have a bad primer bulb. I bought this one for a briggs engine. The cap was not the correct size so I was unable to use it. I need a larger one for the newer mowers with the plastic caps and was not able to find the correct one. I Guess I should have asked for and taken measurments before ordering.Live and learn I guess.Jerry W
5,"Practical, helpful information !!","I bought this for my sister who was recently diagnosed with cancer. This is an easy read, carefully written, practical step by step what to expect, helps walk the patient through the process. Highly recommend this above all other books on the subject."
5,Convinced me to get a second opinion,"I aggree with most of the other reviews: you or your partner must read this book when breast cancer is diagnosed. It gives your clear information about you chances and options. For me, it convinced me to make a girl friend ask for a second opinion, which led to another treatment with better chances. And it gives a lot of information about the drug Tamoxifen, which is used quit offen in treating breast cancer."
5,Great resource,"This is the best resource book that I found for guiding one through the scary world of being diagnosed with breast cancer. It is easy to understand. And, while it is not too technical, it does give good information and explanations of all the terms, tests, medications, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone going through the fight, or to anyone helping someone navigate those waters."
3,A Little Confusing,"I got this book with The Breast Book, and liked the other book better (Dr Susan Love's Breast Book). I did not have the option to seek out clinical trials as I was rushed into treatment YESTERDAY as soon as I was diagnosed. Time was of the essence, and I believed my doctor. I was diagnosed in 2010, two years after a severe stroke, and I was still too fuzzy to be scared, so I went along. Luckily I am fine now after a year of chemo and a mastectomy."
5,works great,"I've used this on about ~10 occasions for very light work on my motorcycles.Seems solid, quality made, very portable, and does the job right."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this item hoping that it would be just like the old TV show that I remember watching. It was really my fault that what I received wasn't what I expected. I must not have read the full description that this was just a copy of an old concert. I would purchase another video, but I would make sure that what I was getting was the actual show."
1,Stop whining!,"Okay, so he did some interesting and adventurous things. However, he did them all with a minimum of preparation and a maximum of ego, a bad combination under the best of circumstances. By his own admission, he did not enjoy travel for the sheer joy of travel and experiencing life. He completely missed the point every step of the way. In the process, he casually dismissed his children, the woman he loved, and he endangered himself and others. He mistreated his dog-sled team by not properly training them, leading to death and injury. And on every step of the way, he whined about his misfortunes at not being ""successful"". This man will NEVER be happy in life. Skip this one."
1,Great adventures but...,"Cold Oceans has a lot of potential but the author reveals too much of himself. Constant references about his personality and details of his outbursts are a downer. He relies on luck and risk taking as opposed to planning and knowledge of his surroundings and means of travel. For a much more enjoyable read with better emphasis on local knowledge try ""Homelands"" or ""On Celtic Tides."" I certainly won't buy another Jon Turk book."
3,Mixed bag has some good moments,"Well this isn't a review as I'm the artist but I did want to give more of a description than is on the page. I've put three stars here only because I was forced to give some number- I have no clue as to how to objectively assess this music today. People tell me they like it, but then again it's unlikely the people that didn't like would tell me, isn't it?This was my first CD as a leader and I was anxious to show my pan stylistic versatility- in retrospect maybe not so wise from a marketing standpoint! The album focusses on music created by my working quartet of the time: the very excellent Mike Smith on drums, bass legend Drew Gress and noted saxist and educator Glenn Cashman.The album also includes a new-ageish piece for piano and synths, a melancholy duet for violin and piano featuring Cynthia Mauney and a piece for string quartet."
2,Entertaining and painful historical read.,"Gives an amazing perspective in how far we've come in birthing. Sort of full circle, back to pride and self trust in birthing. Taking it back from the 'doctors' who think they know best."
5,Thank you Karen for having the faith!,"Thank you Karen for having the faith to find Martin Grey and helping him to get his book republished! I am so very proud of your enormous effort. This story has brought me an understanding of the events of the holocaust I never thought possible. I think with understanding there is a deeper appreciation for what ACTUALY happened. I pray God will not let this happen ever again. We must never forget. With each generation I see a loss of understanding, not that we don't teach history. But, an emotional understanding that comes from real life accounts such as Martin's. Thank you Martin, Karen, Mark and all that put this together!"
1,This man is a liar,"This man has been proven to be a liar by the most average historians, AND he was arresed and convicted on selling bogus antiques (Check his record--it is public). He also was a part of the most violent group ever assembled in his Russian homeland; this group later became known as the KGB. This man is a master of deception and obviously has fooled everyone on this list except me. More info on him is in a report on Michael Hoffman's website."
3,A good novel,"Mr Gray has written an interesting novel in the best traditions of the growing Holocaust genre. However the reader must be careful not to take his word too seriously. While obviously some parts are true (e.g. born in Poland, Mother died, etc) many other parts are pure fiction, as verified by established Holocaust historians. Also Mr Gray brushes over the more unsavory chapters of his life. His membership of the grotesquely evil NKVD is glossed over and not described in any detail (the reader will recall the NKVD were responsible for carrying out the Bolshevik genocide against up to 100 million East Europeans and was composed largely of Russian Jews). Also, Mr Grays mention of the, now known to be, fictional Treblinka Concentration Camp also detracts somewhat from the books veracity. Mr Gray also ran a shady antique furniture business for many years, resulting in him being charged for fraud.The book is an entertaining read but to call it non fiction is a long stretch of the imagination."
1,Disappointed,"I read this book when I was in high school and it made me feel very sorry for the Jewish people. But now that I have grown some I have found that there is always more than one side to every story and the Holocaust is no exception. I read this article today about Wilkomirski's book ""Fragments"" in the Detroit News and I am very disappointed. I have this strange feeling that much of what I have read in the Holocaust genre is fiction written for sympathy or just propaganda. I'm not a ""holocaust denier"" or ""revisionist"" I am just someone who likes to hear both sides of a story before passing judgement. I'm interested now in finding a book written by someone who was on the other side of the fence during the Holocaust.This book had some lessons to be learned in it but not about the Holocaust or Nazism."
5,A Compelling Book --- And A VERY WORTHY Read,"The question as to the accuracy of all of the facts set forth in this book becomes almost irrelevant as one reads through it. Unquestionably most if not all of them ring true. What absolutely kept me glued to this particular book written about the Holocaust was its amazing ability to, through it's candid, brave telling of this remarkable story of one man's life, impart upon the reader subtle and not so subtle lessons about human life. The book's undeniable impact upon the careful, attentive reader speaks for itself. In my opinion, this book should be read by ALL students everywhere seeking truth, knowledge, equity, justice, and human rights."
4,Could have been 5,"The book is truly wonderful and a peice of art. For 95% of the novel, I coudn't put it down...until the end.It seems that the author ran out of gas, gave up, and just ended the book, after spending so much of himself telling the story of pain, anguish and salvation.The book should have ended when Martin got married and had his children. An epilogue should then have been written.But, the story of Martin Gray and his holocaust experiences is truly amazing."
5,One of the best personal narratives of a Holocaust survivor.,"A vivid narrative of the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and all its horrors...Gray pulls no punches in painting the beast, the victims, and his own actions in the fight to survive. A must read!"
3,Astonishingly bad spelling throughout. A major distraction.,"A powerful story, very readable, embellishments and all, EXCEPT for the HORRIBLE SPELLING MISTAKES that should have been easily rectified by even a half-assed edit. This is my soapbox: I have purchased too many Kindle Books riddled with spelling and grammar errors at not so cheap prices. AMAZON HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ITS CUSTOMERS to pressure the publishers to either provide good products or not permit them to be sold on Kindle. Please fellow readers, tell Amazon to clean up their act."
3,Should have been honest about it being fiction,"I read this book several years ago and was moved. It appears that the book is fiction - see the ""Personal Opinion"" column of the London Jewish Chronicle, March 30, 1973. I share some outrage over the apparent revelation - James Frey with an exponent - that it's faction."
5,Nothing to be critical about! It is a monument of hope and love,"How can people question Martin Gray's story, it's just beyond my imagination. Ridiculous and pathetic. Martin Gray is an amazing human being. If anyone is doubting the story, do your research instead of writing stupid comments on a review.For those I loved is a book which follows me everywhere I go."
1,Mistaken purchase,"I bought this on the strength of an Amazon.com review and I must say I'm sorry I did. Lucky I bought a ... copy. Neither story caught/held my interest; none of the characters seemed fresh or interesting & the storylines were tired out, too. Same old, same old in my opinion. Cathy Williams' story was more boring than Kim Lawrence's."
3,Not Moist Enough for me,I want a really rich deep conditioner. This wasn't it. I didn't feel like it left a lasting impact. Smells great though. Probably better for super fine hair that doesn't need the extra weight.
4,Thought through,"Even though the garden philosophy gets a little tiresome, the other 90% of the book is educational and extremely interesting."
4,Toni's Gifts,Another item I ordered for my partner's birthday. She is a beginning gardner and I hoped this would help her along. I have seen utube video with Michael Pollan and have loved the way he delivers his information.
2,"Anti-Wilderness, Cleverly Disguised","Pollan is a very bright and clever writer and all his books are entertaining and well-researched. But his point of view is all humanist and as such is part of the same old agenda as even the worse earth-raping capitalists. Indeed, his later books and essays advocate killing animals, ""getting over"" the ""idea"" of wilderness, and not bothering to preserve nature but rather to just give up and let humans overrun everything. He is a good marketer, has a huge ego, and he tells humans (especially us Hummer-loving Americans) what we want to hear, but people like him are part of the erudite, seemingly sensitive propagandists (such as Bill McKibben) who do not love earth as much as they love humans, thus missing the fact that humans are embarked on a massive earth-killing mission that combines capitalism, ecocide and ultimately suicide."
3,not as good as his earlier books,"I loved his previously written books, but this one felt forced. It was as though it was just time to write another book but there wasn't much to say. I made it through over half of the book, but then decided life is too short to continue!"
5,In the garden?,"I read this book after stumbling across, and very much enjoying, the Botany of Desire by the same author. Pollan's perspective on nature, culture, and the garden's place in both is fresh and extremely well written. This book is both challenging and fun; anyone with even the slightest interest in the sciences will like reading and thinking about the ideas he gives.Pollan's ability to describe people and gardens is worthy of a weekly newspaper column next to Dave Barry. I keep his books on my shelves for re-reading on a leisurely day."
5,Captivating writer - recommending to all my friends,"I read Pollans ""A Place of My Own"" and couldn't wait to read his first book ""Second Nature"". His writing captivates me and I hope he writes many more stories about anything. He's a wonderful teacher, story teller, yarn spinner and his inquisitive nature struck a strong cord. All my friends and relatives will get to enjoy it as a gift from me. Thanks Michael for a great read"
2,Very disappointing,"I had high expectations, after reading his other books. But while this book works hard at being ""deep"", it doesn't look like Pollan has any real depth in the area of gardening. The book is not giving me any insights into gardening, but I am getting insights into Mr. Pollan, and it's sadly not enjoyable.In Omnivore's Dilemna, in the section describing the pig meal, there's some of the this same quality that bothers me so much in this book. It's a smug, self-congratulatory tone, while he doesn't appear to be even concious of all the things he's doing, nor seeing any contraditions. And in both that section of Omnivore's Dilemna, and in several of the essays in this book, the conclusions he draws are flawed, since he's not observing his own actions as thoughfully as he observes the rest of the world.I suppose the writing is nice, though."
2,Second Nature,Nothing about gardening like I had expected. It was more about his like gardening in different places where he lived
4,good product - last long - no waste,These glue sticks work great and they last a long time with no waste. I use them in the Surebonder glue gun. Happy with my purchase.
2,Not what I was looking for...,This book seems to be so deep that you cant swim. I found it very hard to get into a flow with. The literature seems to jump around too vastly and uses unnecessary complicated words to get simple messages across. This book is definately not for the average Christian thats interested in church history. And thats exactly what I am. I dont think it takes this much garble to illuminate such a matter.
5,Welcome to Dheisheh,"Few snapshots as realistic or compelling exist to show the daily grind of Palestinian life in the face of unrelenting Israeli oppression under occupation. Watch the film, visit Dheisheh, and learn to love the amazing Palestinian people, who thrive so mightily while living under the thumb of their morally bankrupt neighbors."
2,Included on the Complete Season set!,"In a very unclear and probably intentionally confusing marketing move, this and all of the other ""2-hour TV special"" Little House DVDs being released separated are actually included on the Complete Season box sets being released by the same company. I purchased three of these ""specials"" before realizing that they were all 2-part episodes to be found on the complete season sets. Usually, a 2-part show like this is released a little while before the season it's included on is... so only buy it if you MUST have it a couple of months ahead of time. While I don't have a problem with these 2-part shows being released separately, I don't understand the need for it and I really, really wish that it would be made clear somewhere on the packaging. Considering that these single disc releases have no special features, this is the worst example of DVD ""double dipping"" I've seen in a long time!!"
5,great!,"Worked as expeted! nice, powerful flow... i only wish they could be more compact, but its not a big deal because they work so well."
4,To Albania? In a Model T?,"I admit to a bias. Helen Dore Boylston was a cousin of my grandfather's and I've been feeling terribly cheated since I read this book because I never met her. The story is remarkable. Two young women decide to drive from Albania to Paris. Their adventures are not, perhaps, quite as colorful as one might hope, but their daring and imagination in deciding upon such an voyage make your realize that Laura Ingalls Wilder really raised one heck of a brave and free daughter. I'd recommend it to anyone who's read the Little House Books or any of Helen Dore Boylston's books about Sue Barton."
5,just buy it!,if you can only buy one cd this year buy this one! mary stallings sings her heart out and the band is happening. i've been listening to mary since 1958 and she keeps getting better. listen and fall in love.
1,Worked too well,"I went completely numb and was unable to keep it up. It was embarrassing. Also, my partner started to feel numb as well. I would not recommend these."
2,Not for every one,"It does what it is supposed to do, it prolongs your hardness and creates numbness. This is not for every one, I recommend this to people who has early ejaculation problem."
2,WOWW,"Ok so here's the deal...I'm usually not the one in the relationship who gets off first, and tonight I was in desperate need of a condom and as any 20 yr old I don't want a baby!!!! Well my best friend swears up and down on this condom and gives me this extended pleasure. Well I think nothing of it, just a condom........NOT I ended up going for an hour and a half and abs hurting and well after she got off the first time had to go to hand joob.....still didn't work.....I go to the bathroom and try my self......FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I can't get myself,,,,,,needless to say it numbs it WAY too much!!!!!Works if you need that BUT....... DO NOT USE UNLESS U HAVE A PROBLEM!!!!!!!!"
3,Don't Buy the Used ones!,"The USED ones may be cheaper, but trust me, buy the NEW ones. I tell you, what won't Amazon sell used!"
1,Horrible,"These are awful. A friend had some so I grabbed one on the way to my girls house. Well I got there and we where all set then I couldn't feel a thing. And neither could she. These have a numbing lubricant that is supposed to control climax. Oh it will control it, they control it so well you can't come. Skip these go with something else NOT climax controlling."
5,Excellent for premature ejaculation problem,"Alright, so before making the purchase I read all the reviews on here, and half of them are complaints about how this condom will make your penis numb, and you won't feel anything at all. With this climax control condom on, I can go three times longer than without it, that's how good it works for me. My girlfriend was pretty happy. Now about the issue of condom making your penis feel numb, it's suppose to do that! lol. But I can still feel the great sensation of the intercourse. Remember, this is meant to make you last longer, it DOES NOT make you stay hard longer, there's the difference! So if you have erectile dysfunction to begin with, obviously putting this numbing condom on will make your case even worse; you need something like viagra not a numbing condom. Again, this product is for normal healthy men who don't have problem staying fully erect, but just ejaulate early, so this condom will make you stay fullly erect longer."
1,Sex would have lasted longer without,"I didnt have a problem with climaxing too early. I put one of these on in hopes I would last long enough to finish the job but instead made me completely numb so I couldnt keep it up. My partner also said it didnt feel as good to her, the numbing got both of us and I lost all feeling to my shaft. Sex lasted a whopping like 2 mins before it wouldnt stay hard. Waited 5 mins or so then switched back to ultra ribbed."
3,"Sturdy, numbing condoms","I'm afraid these are not my favorite condoms. Although these are sturdy, reliable condoms (I find Trojan to be a consistent, reliable brand), due to the excess of numbing material it takes the fun out of using the product. Only use if you need excessive numbing."
5,I have never heard a single bad comment about this,"My husband buys these to sell to his friends and he sells them by the hundreds.... I have never tried them, he calls them the magical condoms.... but all the comments I get are excellent, men using this product last a lot longer, over an hour in one sex session, but need to take it out in order to ejaculate, because it kinds of numb the penis.... I guess at the end just use a bit of imagination, and change to oral...."
2,Too slow,"This film is not bad in regard to biblical accuracy, but there are three problems. (1) It is primarily an old man telling the stories, rather than dramatization of the events. (2) It mixes scriptures from different parts of the Bible so that it is not just Genesis one is hearing in this film. (3) The primary problem is that the film is slow, with a long shots where nothing much is happening."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I THINK THIS WAS BORING. NOT MUCH ACTION AND TALKING. IT'S MORE LIKE A DOCUMENTRY. I AGREE IT IS SCRIPTUAL BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT PORTRAYS THE ACTION FILLED NOAH, THE FLOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL EDEN."
1,True but boring,"Poorly produced and acted. Scriptually correct, but poorly done. I got more excited reading genesis in my bible than watching this."
1,The Creation and Noah`s Ark,"Hi I`ve just saw this production of Genesis . I am sorry but Ithink that Lux Vide could have done a better production of thecreation and the flood . I could not understand who the Naratorwas . What had the Beginning and that man`s life had to do witheach other . The other productions like Solomon,Abraham,EstherJesus were much better"
1,RUN,"Run, don't walk away from your computer screen. This is this worse made video of all time! One person talks through the entire DVD. He is the only one who can speak English. It shows alot of faces which the end credits to ""the people of Mongolian!"" The flood scene looks like it was made in a run down barn with a few (like three) animals by a 4 years old."
1,sooo bad!,"It was like those dubbed old chineese films, the guys lip movement was not in sync with his voice...The film was horrible all the way through, in fact towards the end of the film when they were depicting the evilness of the world (before the flood), they showed a modern night club in NYC! LOL! I recommend this film just to see that part, that scence was so out of place...quite funny indeed!"
2,The Ending,"This is possibly one of the most boring Bible movies I've ever seen in my life. It's slow, the scenes aren't really that interesting and why the decision to go verbatim I'll never understand. It wasn't really necessary. If you were to use this as a tool for those who are new to the stories, you'd lose them. It's just that boring. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.The best part of the whole film is maybe Noah's Ark, but it wasn't really enough to save the film.The dubbing over wasn't really that good, but I'll forgive it that. There are better Genesis movies; or it's just best to break it up into smaller stories to get a better understanding of this important book in the Bible."
1,Disappointed,"I, too wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this movie, and I bought it from Amazon! I didn't even watch the entire movie. I got through the first 30-40 minutes and could see that it wasn't going to get any better. Most movies I watch, I like something about them and the majority of them would get two stars or better. This is one of those rare instances in which, if it were possible, it wouldn't get any stars. Don't waste your money."
3,Not skate shoes,I was under the impression that these shoes had wheels on them since they are called skate shoes. Wrong!! They are regular sneakers. They are really cute and look nice but don't buy them if you think that they are skate shoes.
2,DIdn't last long,I bought these at Target for my sons. My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart. Not too long in my opinion.
3,Wanna-Be's review,This film is not great but pretty good. The animation is nice. The story is weird and scary. The cast members are a little bland but still entertaining. The action is top rate. The cover is pretty basic but still fun to look at. The ending is confusing. The main thing wrong with it is that it's still not in english but it's still a pretty good film. I give this movie a 6.6 out of 10.
3,amazing book,this book is an excellent commentary about politics and I feel talkingpolitics.com is another great place to continue the conversation and political chatter that this book will provoke.
4,Great Watch for Gift,"This watch is good for gifting. It surely looks more that the purchase price. I would recommend this watch for anybody. Just make sure, that they come with running batteries. I had to exchange it and it still didn't come with running batteries. I went to local store and replaced the batteries and Amazon immediately paid for the battery cost."
2,Very heavy and Gaudy,"This watch is very heavy, THICK and appears super fancy when you take it in your hand. In the picture it appears to be very elegant.I bought it and returned it immediately after receiving it."
5,"Beautiful, Beautiful","I don't have the single (yet) but I've got the album (Movement...) and it's also on Sasha's GU Ibiza CD2 (another incredible album, by the way). This is one of those songs that you never get tired of, like Flaming June. I wish I could spend a day/week with Brian in his studio just seeing how he creates all this beautiful music."
5,BEST for TREATS & DIETS!,"My husband and I first discovered these after dinining at a local ""better"" restaurant. They really have an intense flavor. Honestly, ONE is completly satisfying. A ""serving"" is 13, which I have NEVER consumed in one sitting.. 2-3 is the most I can handle and usually come away with felling somewhat decadent, they're so rich! After losing weight, I was searching for a ""diet-friendly"" chocolate, but the ""diet"" chocolate foods at the local grocers and via ""weight-loss systems"" just cannot satisfy the palate! Well THIS is for YOU. The flavor is TOTALLY CHOCOLATE-MINT and you will be completely satisfied with just a few! Super high flavor and super LOW calories/carbs!"
3,Note,"This particular import is in Arabic. The description does not allude to this very important fact. I wish I understood Arabic, because the story is sung to music. I'm giving it 3 stars because it does sound beautiful, but it is virtually useless if you do not understand the language."
4,A riveting novel!,"Completely riveting!One of the most memorable books I have read. It's tender and funny at the same time. In some parts, I couldn't stop laughing and in other parts it became uncomfortably poignant. Long after I'd put 'Ode to Lata' down, I couldn't shake it from my mind. I couldn't put it down and when I was finished, I wished it didn't have to end."
2,"Oh, grow up!","Dhalla's finely honed writing skills almost but not quite manage to mask the fact that his story is basically a whiny, insubstantial roman a clef that eventually grates. Maybe finding true love in Los Angeles is really this difficult, but it seems that the choices made by Dhalla's protagonist Ali are not especially wise. Street hustlers usually are not good husband material, a fact of gay life that cannot have been unknown to Ali, given his sexual and social history. Neither are promiscuous party boys, another object of Ali's misguided affections. No wonder he is miserable.Unfortunately, there is no relief for lovelorn Ali, whose unhappiness is the result of his own failings, not the fault of his suitors. This sort of gay self-loathing and failure to connect is a very old, very hackneyed plot.The book does have something to offer, however, in terms of seeing gay life from the perspective of the gay Asian and South Asian subculture, which is its only redeeming point."
2,"Live Fat,Die Young","Fat wreckchords suckered me into this one! They advertised great bands, but put someones ..garage band on the disc. Two stars for the two bands that [aren't bad]!"
1,come to the troft you fat losers,Once again another fat comp of watered down (pseudo) punk tunes. The garbage put out by fat-wreck-chords is amazingly bad. But I guess when you don't know what punk is you buy into what they are selling. But on the upside I think fat-wreck-chords are the best in true Capitalism...make that money honey.Buyer beware.... there are real punk comps out there.This isn't one of them though.
5,Where the Spirit Lives,This is a most excellent film! I took a course in Native American Representation in media. This was by far the best of all. It is deeply moving and gives an excellent portrayal of what these schools were like for the children. I would highly recommend this film!
3,call it a one year plus (maybe) battery,"I bought the LX700 phone in Feb 2000. I charge the battery about once a week, and about once a month I discharge it completely using a pair of 10 watt resistors, then recharge. Complete discharge is recommended in the instructions, and the deluxe charger does it automatically. But I just discharged it this week (Aug 2001)and it won't recharge. It is deader than hammer. So it lasted one year and 6 months, which means it probably went through around 80-100 charges. What may be a year and a half for me may be only a few months for you big-shots that talk all the time. It is also overpriced..., but all batteries are."
1,Pepe Kalle!!!,"If you like the peppy rhythyms and guitars of old school soukous, then this is the album you want. The opening track ""Teimbe Raid Pa Moli"" is by far my favorite, and it sets the tone for the rest of the album.Pepe Kalle's soukous style is always timeless, and never watered down. Two thumbs up!!!"
3,must have gotten a dud...,"we bought this for our 3yo boy for Christmas after he fell in love with one at a birthday party two months ago. he loved fitting the pieces of mail, with the stamps attached, into the appropriate slots on the mailbox. opening the door with the key was the icing on the cake. he pretended to be a mailman for a solid week afterward. i knew we'd have to get him one.when ours came, the door fell off. the dowel rods that serve as hinges were too short. it was an easy thing for my husband to replace them with longer pieces of dowel, but it sure was disappointing.the door is fixed now and the boy loves his mailbox."
3,twin 4 year olds,"THis was a terrific idea. THe kids loved it. The door held my magnets would open when they dropped the mail in, this frustrated the kids. The piece that held the lock in place came off (the glue didn't hold). We repaired it with s screw. It was an easy fix but you shouldn't have to fix a new toy."
3,melissa and doug mailbox,"The overall ""idea"" of this toy is great. It's both educational and fun, especially for the child who enjoys imaginative play. I was upset, however, that the toy had a significant size chip in it when my daughter received it. So, it's a great toy, but definitely not the most durable."
3,"Neat product, mediocre durability","Our 2 year old loves to play ""mail."" The product is neat by design but could be a bit more durable, possibly made of a different material. It's made of wood and the corners seem to crack and fray easily. If I had to do it again, I'd buy this at a local retailer to avoid damage in shipping. Good news...our little guy doesn't notice the flaws...he loves to put the velco stamps on the letters and drop them in the mailbox slots."
3,"Great product, but...","The mailbox is adorable and the letters and stamps are fun, but unfortunately, the lock was broken the first day and the whole door finally came off within a couple of weeks. If your kids aren't as boisterous as ours, it may last longer, but as far as I'm concerned, it's no match for a 5 year old boy. It's a shame too, because I have lots of Melissa & Doug toys and this is the only one that didn't hold up well."
2,"Great concept on the toy, but poor design","I m a great fan of Melissa and Doug products. However, I am very disappointed on the construction of the Mailbox. Both the front door and the rear door are held together by weak wooden dowel as hinghes. On the first hour of play, one of the wooden dowel snapped and the front door felt off. Thumb down on the Mailbox set !!"
2,Fun but not durable,"My children were very excited about this toy because my son has a mailman costume and he and my daughter love to play dress-up but just like all the other reviews, within an hour of opening the toy, the door was broken. It was difficult to even keep it closed because the wooden letters seemed to heavy and were pushing against it. Since the toy is only a week old, the door is currently being kept closed with tape until we can find a better way to fix it. Despite all that, the kids love it and they've been playing with it non-stop. However, I wish I had read these reviews beforehand because I would not have made the purchase."
3,Barb's Review of The Melissa and Doug Mailbox Set,"I purchased this for my daughter's 3rd birthday. I think that the idea of this toy is great, very educational, however, this toy is not very well made. The little door that opens with the key, fell off the first day, the little piece that holds the dowel that the door is attached to is very thin. If it was better constructed it would be a great toy!!!"
3,"Great Toy, a few problems, great customer service",We too like many of these reviewers had the experience of the door falling off. It cracked some of the wood pieces. I contacted Melissa and Doug directly and they were AWESOME! They are supposed to send us a new mailbox which they say has been redesigned (we'll put it to the test and see). They were definetly the nicest company to deal with.
1,"Great idea, but POOR quality!","As other reviewers stated, this thing is not put together well at all. We ordered this for my 3yr old for Christmas, because he is fascinated by mail. He loved it, but the back door broke loose the first night. We used Elmer's wood glue to glue it back on and didn't let him play with it for a day. It has held since then, but we have decided that we will reinforce with screws if it happens again. Also, the paint was chipped on top as soon as we took it out of the plastic. I was just disappointed in it. I couldn't send it back because my son does enjoy playing with it. I would recommend this because there is nothing else on the market like it, but not if you don't want to have to repair it or add screws to make it more sturdy. Like I said in my title: Great idea, but very poor quality."
4,"Bad toy, great company","My son received this as a gift. Like to other reviews we had issues. The lock fell off and my children ended up using it as a dog house, a $40- dog house! I e-mailed the company and they were horrified that this happened and within 2 weeks my children had a new mailbox to play with (and they have been playing non-stop with it). The new mailbox is different. The doors are different. The lock is held on with screws instead of glue and the other door has 3 circles of velcro and a small hole to put one finger inside to open the door. There is no more magnet. They have made great changes in this product so I give the old version of the mailbox 2 stars, the company 5 stars and the new mailbox style 5 stars!"
3,After a year...,".. it's toast. Both doors have broken off and can no longer even be fixed anymore. The mail is horribly dinged up, just from banging against each other in the mailbox. The stamps don't tend to stay on well after a couple months of intermitten use and sadly it's now sitting in our closet since the door splintered when coming off and can't be glued again."
1,"Boring, at the best.....","It was the first book I read from that author and it certainly will be the last. The plot is almost non-existant, the dialogues are unbelivable specially the ones involving the little girl, no children speaks or thinks like that and, above all, there is the romance, what is it with american female mystery authors? They seem to be unable to write a real thriller, they always have to add these sirupy romances. I read it till the end just to see if I was right about the guilty party, I was... a real deception."
2,the target,"I found the character Ramsey totally unbelievable.And Molly seemed inconsistant.It made a fairly good read, but not up to her normal excellance."
3,has a lot of potential,"I really liked Ms. Coulter's books in general but The Target left me feeling unsatisfied. It seems that Ramsey could have Emma without Molly and still be happy. And the ending felt rushed in that after all that suspence everything was resolved ASAP. Ms. Coulter could have done more with the rest of the supporting charaters, and the love scenes felt liked it was just an afterthought, plunked right down near the end. But the redeeming quality was that there were certain scenes that was very witty and funny."
4,I really like it.,"I like the book. Although I somewhat agree with some of the negative reviews, I still like the book. The suspense was good and it really had me guessing as to the real purpose behind the kidnap of the little girl. The judge reminds me of the judge in the TV series Dark Justice."
3,Reader from San Diego,I liked this book. All the characters were interesting enough to keep me reading till the end. Read it in one day! She could have gone on more about Eve but its ok. Great book!
2,A Let Down Read,"When a kid is smarter than the adults fiction is in trouble. Kidnapping and child abuse are tough subjects, but a Judge who doesn't notify the police and a mother who isn't hysterical are hard to swallow. I've enjoyed Coulter's stories in the past but THE TARGET never worked for this reader.Savich and Sherlock do stop by for an encore, but without their normal punch. If you are a fan of her writing you may enjoy it, but for others pass this one by, Ms. Coulter can construct a better story.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Not as good as other Coulter books,"After reading The Cove and The Maze, The Target was a bit disappointing. It was not very believable and somewhat slow. The other two books were real page turners. I kept waiting for more of the cliffhanger chapters to come, but they didn't. A good read, but a bit disappointing."
2,The book lacked character development,"The main male lead, the Judge, had no character development. It was as if she expected you to already understand why a childless man would take an instant liking to this child. She then exaggerates the confusion by asking the reader to belive it plausible that would endanger his life fro them. Basically it was illogical."
3,politically correct language,"Just thought I would let you know I did enjoy the book but found the writing to be little upsetting. I refer to a passage in the last part of the book when the characters are in Ireland. You refer to one of the characters as sitting ""Indian style"". As a preservice teacher who has encountered many Native American and Native Canadian students in my work experience, I find that term distasteful. How hard is it to refer to someone sitting crosslegged or scissor style? I just think you could have been more careful in the selection of language you used."
4,This book was not as good as The Maze,"This book was not written vey well. The writing seemed sloppy. I don't mean to nit-pick, but the sentence structure was juvenile and made her seem unintelligent. However, I enjoyed the plot. That was what saved her. I would have liked to have seen more of Dillon and Savich, they seemed to pop up every once in a while, but they were unessecary to the plot. I think she should have included them better. The Maze was much better in terms of the over-all presentation of the novel. This book was a slight dissappointment but it's still worth the read. I'm sure I will still continue to read her work. I enjoy a good suspense book with a little splash of romance. I give the book three and a half stars,(but there was no option for half stars)."
4,"Fast paced, interesting characters","I enjoyed The Target and thought all the characters were very interesting. Judge Hunt was an interesting mix with Emma & Molly. I was disappointed that there were several typo's (like Page 192 referring to Judge Hunt as Judge Hurt) that can be distracting and make you reread several paragraphs. I think it is nice to have an author do something a little different once in a while instead of the same ""romance"" stories."
4,Another great suspense book from Coulter!,"I loved The Cove and The Maze, and Coulter did it again with The Target. I loved the characters, especially Emma, the little girl who is rescued by Ramsey. I was hooked from page one and couldn't put it down. I also love when Coulter uses characters from her other books -- Dillon and Sherlock Savich from The Maze appear in this one, which was a real treat. Great suspense and awesome ending."
2,Not a TRUE Coulter.,"I could not be labeled as a ""Fan"" of Catherine Coulter's after reading this book. It was too different from the rest of her books. Too based around the child. Ms. Coulter, I believe, is an adult romance writer. My preference is for the novel to be centered on the two adults and their romance, not a 'perfect' little girl. I was disappointed that Ms. Coulter would write this and I actually feel sorry for anyone who spends their money on The Target. I honestly believe that they would be better off reading the Bride Series or Legacy Series or perhaps The Cove and The Maze. I am not thrilled that I spent money on this book. I think it is a shame that Ms. Coulter lowered her normally wonderful standards. I must say though, this is the first of her books that has disappointed me."
4,VERY GOOD,"I really like the book...not done reading just yet, but glad to know the beginning of Savich and Sherlock. I have read all the other books including them. I gave them five stars!"
4,A good book to keep you awake.,Too much dialogue and more action would be nice. I prefer more like the maze which was a tremendous read.
1,A Dud!,"As others have explained, a federal judge hiding out in the woods for some privacy finds a severly abused girl. For eight (count 'em, 8) days - until her mother comes blazing into the book - he nutures her and cares for her himself, without notifying the authorities, without taking her to the hospital, and apparently without any consideration of the fact that somewhere she has a family going crazy with worry. Of course, during this time, he tends her wounds, washing away any physical evidence that she would be carrying of her attacker. This guy is a judge??? Then, when her mother enters the picture, she *thanks* him for keeping her daugher with him. That's the worst kind of hideous fiction that I can imagine. I generally like Catherine Coulter, but I could not even go on with this book after the first 50 pages or so: The beginning bordered on ""fantasy"" not ""fiction."""
1,Totally unbelievible,"I enjoy reading books and watching movies because they take me away from my normal existence, and have the imagination to accept when an author will stretch reality. Unfortunatly, Catherine Coulter took reality and stretched it way past the breaking point. Her description of a six year old girl made me wonder if she has ever met a child, or used Shirley Temple and a six year old Jesus Christ as her model. I got so tired of hearing about her perfection I wanted to pull her braid (mentioned approx. 1,000 times) right out of her head. The Judge and Molly were totally unbelivible. I kept imagineing myself in the same position as the Judge, finding an unconsious six year old girl, sexually abused, unconsious in the forest. Sure, I'll take her and hold her for about a week!"
1,Pure Torture,"I always finish a book once I start but this one was painful. Judge Ramsey was so unbelieveably sickeningly sweet that he made my stomach turn. The child, Emma, was smarter than the adults and the mother, Molly was completely inconsistent. Emma did not behave nor speak like a six year old. It made me wonder about the children the author has been around? What child speaks this way? Molly and Ramsey's love affair? Totally unbelievable and undeveloped...again PUKE! This was my first Coulter novel and I am not sure I want to try another. Reading this one was pure torture for me!"
3,Not her best....,"This book was not written very well but the writing seemed sloppy. The plot was strong but the characters weak. I would have liked to see more of Dillon and Savich, who popped up every once in a while, but they were unnecessary to the plot. I think she should have included them better. The Maze was much better but they all can't be winners. This book was a slight disappointment but all in all it still is a pretty good read. I always enjoy a good suspense novel with a little spatter of romance!"
1,Just Plain Boring,"I am a voracious reader and make it a habit to always finish a book; however, with this one it was a real EFFORT. Unlike others who have reviewed this book, I found it lacking in suspense, found the characters unbelievable (what child talks the way Emma did) and uninteresting. I doubt I will be reading anything further by C. Coulter."
1,This book inspires me to become a novelist,"I bought this book as a ""beach"" read, something to pass the time, with no prior knowledge of this author. It boasted ""New York Times Bestseller"" on the cover, which is one reason why I bought it. It can't be that bad, I thought, if it's a bestseller. I was in for a big surprise! This book, with its unbelievable characters,unrealistic dialogue,poor plot development, and just plain poor writing, was a bestseller? It's frightening, when you think about it. I have definitely overestimated the intelligence of the American reading public.What a sad commentary that such a book can become a bestseller."
4,Good read,"For the most part I enjoyed reading this book. If you don't like to read about children in harm's way, though, this book is not for you. I could have done without the sexual abuse of a child part of the book. (there was not graphic detail of the assault More bad language than I care to read in a book, but not excessive or I would have tossed it. This is an older book by Coulter, and I had a hard time finding it."
2,Fairly bad,"The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one."
3,not bad,This story was all right.I didn't find it gripping as I do some other romantic suspense books that I've read.I was able to figure out who was behind the kidnappings etc about a third of the way through the book but wasn't sure as to why. I found the romance between Ramsey and Molly a little bit forced towards the end of the book.Not enough chemistry and build up between them.Also most as if the romance was an after thought.I think the storyline was good but could have been put together better.I'll try one of her novels again because all authors write books that aren't always at their best.
2,Disappointing,"I actually finished reading this book, although I had put it down for over a week. Just not enough suspense to be a page turner. Many of the characters are just not believable and the conversations tend to be flat--no pizazz.Coultur seems to have fallen into the same trap other writers have--get a few great novels going (Maze,Cove) and the editors stop doing their job as they figure the book will sell anyway.Get another editor Catherine and please stop making referencesabout body parts, i.e. ""down to their toes."""
2,What was I thinking when I bought this book!!,"I have read the comments from a lot of readers and I have to agree with the ones that disliked this book. This is the first time that I have read something by this author, and believe me it will be the last. The characters were unbelievable, ever changing, etc. There just seemed to be too much focus on dumb things, for example the girl's braid, I don't know how many times it was mentioned, give me a break! I kept on going just because the author promised that you would not be able to guess who was the bad guy. Turns that I did, about halfway throughout the book. I could not believe the end! Did she get bored too?"
1,She missed the Target on this one,"Most of Catherine Coulter's stories are good. Not The Target. This one starts off with the main character, a judge, deciding to secretly keep and care for a kidnapped child he found in the woods. He can't stand the idea of anyone else trying to care for her - including her parents. His reasoning is frightening, to the point that I wished he would have been arrested for his illegal acts, including kidnapping and washing down a rape victim. Sorry, Catherine. This one was really off Target."
1,First and Last Coulter,"I thought, a judge finds a sexually abused girl in the woods and calls no one? I must be missing something. So I read on. It got no better. This was such a poorly conceived book, I couldn't make it past the halfway point of the story."
1,Ludicrous.,"This book is truly unbelievable. None of the characters are even remotely realistic. A federal judge who finds a child in the woods, beaten and sexually abused, and DOESN'T involve the feds or even the cops? In fact, he ""kidnaps"" the girl himself. A six year old child who is smarter than an adult? Some of the responses this child made to questions or situations that arose made me shake my head and wonder if Catherine Coulter could possibly have any children of her own. How about a mom who singlehandedly rescues the child and confronts the ""kidnapper"" all alone? How about a rock singer father who just happens to stop existing as soon as the story needs him to? How about a maternal grandfather who....I could go on and on, but it's not worth it. In fact, this book was so ridiculous I didn't finish the last chapter. A total waste of money and time."
3,Too Blunt to be an Awesome Mystery,"GOOD PART ABOUT THE BOOK:It was interesting, good plot and it went on a fast pace.BAD PART ABOUT THE BOOK:There was no suspense. Coulter laid down the story in a straight-forward way and it didn't let you think and worry what's going to happen. The character's dialogue is too blunt and there's no secrecy in the book and one thing I really hated was how the characters had to state their feelings instead of the reader ""feel"" what the characters felt. Another thing was that the dialogue was really blunt and everything just came out of the mouths of the character. If they were feeling a certain way, they would just say it and I don't think that, that would have made a good suspense because it's like popping the balloon before it has even been blown.I really hope that Coulter could improve her writing style because although her ideas are really interesting, Coulter doesn't do the ideas justice with her straight forwardness."
2,Unsettling Ending,"The story took a turn for the worse after Molly showed up. It was just a little unbelievable (and slightly creepy) that the man was so hung up on this little girl and basically he wants to marry, not because he's in love with the mother, but because he wants to be the child's father."
3,deeply disturbing,"I am a huge Coulter fan and have read everything that she has written. But, I found this book deeply disturbing. A child is raped and then rescued by a federal judge who is as obsessed with her as the rapist. He marries the mother, as she knows (never telling her ""I love you""), to have legal rights to her daughter. He takes care of the daughter, washing her, braiding her hair, always holding her, always hugging her,etc. never letting her out of his sight. His behavior is almost pedophilic. There is something very wrong in this unhealthy behavior. I am surprised at Cathreine Coulter. Also, Savich and Sherlock, her two star FBI agents from the series, barely make an appearance in the book and it could have been written entirely without them. It seemed as though she included them just so that the publishers would sell it."
2,Ok ONLY if little kids are your one passion in life,"Catherine Coulter is a decent writer, so even though I dislike a heavy presence of children in my novels, I could still finish the tapes. But I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that this little girl was in almost EVERY sentence. I don't know much about kids, but I have never seen anything close to this one. She was so unbelievable I almost laughed several times. I hope the very low reviews of this novel convince Ms. Coulter to abandon this type of story line."
5,Viva Daniela!!!!!,"This album is one of favorites.... It very up lifting music and it songs is different and enjoyable... I love her music!!!! Her music has change my life in so many ways as I have growth with it for this 7 seven year of my life... Its another great album, straight out of Bahia... Axe Axe... Viva carnaval brasileira.... Eu te amo voce Daniela...."
5,Must have classic,"Black Moon and the rest of the BCC cooked up a classic w/ this album.....The beats are all dark, grimy , and laid back....This album is remenicent of Wu-Tang and a lot of that dark,grimy hip hop that was coming out between 93-95Theres so many classic tracks on this album and NO FILLER....Make sure to download or somehow check for their remix to ""i got cha opin"" bc its even much better than the original..."
2,Stunningly forgettable album...,"I bought Enta da Stage in 1994, and just recently popped it into my stereo after nearly a decade-long hiatus. Nothing new in '94 and definitely nothing new 9 years later. Some of the dark, heavy beats could potentially create some sort of atmosphere to back their braggadoccia, but they lack that certain, how do you say, je ne sais quoi. Actually, that's not it. They lack any sort of musical complexity. The instrumentation is thin and undynamic. Black Moon is essentially hip hop at it's most mundane. Some big-headed [folks] talking about how tough they are over a tiresome drizzle of generic beats. I'm putting this album back on the shelf where it belongs..."

Buckshot was like John the Baptist to me when this record cameout (Nas was Jesus!). The Beatminers killed the soundscape. I don't care if they were just looped and filtered, the samples where f!@$in' incredible. Buckshot carried this record on his little a$$ back and you could almost track his lyrical maturation from the first cut to the last. ""Buck Em Down"" is one of the hardest records ever made. Other standout cuts include ""N!&&az Talk S#it"", ""U Da Man"" and the unf@&kwitable classic ""How Many Emcees"". The remixes they came out with after this album dropped were damn near better than the originals (check ""Buck em Down"" and ""I Gotcha Opin"" for proof positive)! Cop this immediately and rock it in th 0- seis like it just came out Tuesday! Real hip hop. Period."
4,Solid Release,"Skunkhour are a very underatted band and would probably have had more success if hitting the music scene now. An interesting mixture of funk, up tempo, spoken word, horns and strong crisp vocals gives them a unique sound.They were probably a rawer version of Fat Freddys Drop of the 90's.This is one of my favorite albums."
4,Exotic fare,"A tasty treat for those interested in stuff off the beaten path. If you're tired of the usual narrative boiler plate, head for the luxuriant settings of Paul Stein's odyssey. Where's Namerow's next?"
3,shawls just OK,"I bought 2 of these Elegant [Club Pashmina} Shawls--one in light gray, to wear at a fall wedding, and the other in light blue, as a gift to a relative. The very pale light gray color complemented my midnight-blue gown; the light blue color was not as attractive as Nordstrom's light blue pashmina. Both shawls are soft, but I wouldn't call them ""elegant."" The fabric is not as thick or as luxe as my other (true) pashminas (which are not from amazon.com or Club Pashmina); and the individually braided fringe strands and a very faint almost herringbone-like weave make the shawls look casual, not really suitable with formal wear. (I don't remember seeing the enlarged photo of the fringe now available with amazon's product description. Otherwise, I might have looked for a different wrap.) My shawl also snagged easily. For the price, these items are OK, but will probably be reserved for less-than-formal occasions."
5,looking forward toward the new music,bolshoi never to japan but south america and eastern europe. how come this. the keyboard player now run electronicmusic.com and a new album from paul soon I hear.
4,Good Product,This makes my skin look and feel nice. A little goes a long way. Retinol is so good for your skin and I use this everyday.
5,Great price!,This is one of the basic creams that you will need for wrinkles! Great price! and it works great as compared to expensive products that do the same thing.
4,Good Value,"This product was exactly what I needed to remodel the bathroom. I wanted to open up the room which had been dark, given the enclosed tub. This rod allowed me to open up the line of sight so that the room seemed larger, even when the shower curtain was closed.I was able to figure out how to install it with little problem, but I would have preferred a line or two of suggestions about the sequence of installing the various parts, including the best position on the rod for the support ring. It wasn't a big deal, but there was NO written material of any kind included in the package.All in all, if you are looking for an ""L"" shaped shower rod, this one is pretty good. Acehardwareonline also got it to me efficiently and promptly."
3,Good and Bad mixture,Same review as The Mummy. Some good movies mixed with some bad; get it if you like to complete your set.
5,Glad to SEE it!,"I only bought this to complete my Universal Monsters series, but it's actually a good collection. The first movie is a landmark because of the brand new special effects. As old as this movie is, they hold up to this day. The other movies, while not exactly sequels are interesting,too. Universal Monster fans should get this set. They will not be disappointed."
5,The Invisable Man - The Legacy Collection,"Invisible Man - The Legacy Collection (The Invisible Man/Invisible Man Returns/Invisible Agent/Invisible Woman/Invisible Man's Revenge)This set is excellent,love the old time ""Corny"" horror movies.They are good for us ole timers to watch.None of the ""Blood and Guts"" they put in the current movies.Buy ""The Legacy Collection(s)"",and enjoy"
5,"A Classic Yes, but is it really the best print?","It is without a doubt a classic. A great film, but the DVD has a lot of specks and white spots on the print. I know the film was made in 1933. I just wonder if this was really the best print or if it could have been cleaned up better. Anyway, I'd still buy it."
2,two movies dont work for some unknown reason,"All these movies are good classics, but the problem is that Universal Studios' dvd transfer is horrible. two of the movies in this boxset dont even work and freeze when ever you play them. and its not just with this item, but also with some other legacy boxsets (including the one from hammer that are owned by universaL STUDIOS. either universal doesnt know how to transfer old movies onto dvds, or im just seeing things."
4,Old Movies got it right.,"These are the movies of my childhood and I still love them. They were able to intertain you without gore, foul lanuage, or filth. Need more like them."
4,the invisible man,"this was one of my favorite horror movies as a kid.it still holds up well. it is a great addition toany classic horror collection. the performance byClaude Rains is chilling and there is great humor in themovie. for its time, the special effects are amazing.nice quality on DVD too."
5,Love That Mean Invisible Man!,"The Invisible Man is a great horror movie. It introduced Claude Rains to the world and created a fun franchise for Universal pictures, the monster movie giant. A scientist studies night and day to find the clue to invisibility only to experience success on himself. Unfortunately with time, it drives him a little mad too. So the monster show begins! The other films are interesting and professionally made but not up to par with the great original The Invisible Man. Quirky and of interest, I mildly enjoyed them and appreciated them for what they were. Probably good shows for the kiddies on Saturday afternoons. Great collection."
4,The quality is quite visible,"A maverick researcher (Claude Rains) uses an invisibility drug on himself, then goes into hiding while attempting to develop an antidote. Unbeknownst to himself, the drug also induces megalomania, and before long he will become the terror of the English countryside.Although it may have been a severe miscalculation for Jack Griffin to subject himself to the drug before he had a countermeasure, there are no miscalculations on the part of director James Whale, who is responsible for some of the very best vintage Universal horror pictures. The special effects are surprisingly good for the era and present no bar to enjoyment. The script, though it departs significantly from the H.G. Wells source material, is intelligent. No review of this film is complete without praise for Rains, who appears only at the very end and only for a moment, but whose superb vocal performance and physical expression, while hidden under bandages, presents a fully realized character."
2,I don't like it live.,I bought the pedal to use 2-4 times a night to get over the top 80's hard rock/metal tones. This box sounded OK in the home studio but sounded awlful live at stage level. You have to crank the output all the way up to get back to unity gain. My guitar sounded like a highly compressed kazoo. Again it sounds OK at living room volume but not live used in conjunction with a Mesa Boogie DC-5 amp.
2,"Bad, cheap-sounding pedal","I have a Grunge pedal which I rated 5 stars, I played this pedal in a store and sounded terrible, even through a 50 watt Marshall. It sounds very cheap and high-pitched. It's got this weird tone to it, I hated it. Buy a Grunge, you'll be much happier."
3,the standard,"its the same battery that comes with the phone, no frills. out of the box, took some cycles to get it to hold charges better. has yet to meet the advertised talk times in digital service areas."
4,Witty but scary look at show trial phenomena,"If theatre, politics, philosophy are an interest then this short novel will appeal to you. Trials can be fascinating theatre and the purpose of political show trials is partly to provide some relief or satisfaction for the suffering public out for revenge. Mr Barnes is outstanding at getting inside the heads of the protagonists, and some of the funniest moments are the monologues of the accused Petkanov. But he also provides witty asides into fashion, folklore, and history. A great read."
4,Ups and Downs,"Some of the songs are really good, the others are really not good. The good songs are worth the album!"
2,Not as good as her other 2 albums,"Sabrina Setlur is Germany's most famous rapper. Her first two albums were pretty good while her third album lacks real hits. It's a bit like she lost the bite. Many known names like Cora E. and Brixx are on this album, but this was so far her biggest flop."
4,Worth Some Patience,"This is one of those books that once you take the time to get familiar with, it will pull you along at a slow and sometimes painful pace. The honest and direct sensuality of the people, Kate's confusion between the love of life and the distaste for the common man, the marraige of religions, and the stuggle to become true men and women do offer the reader a wonderfly detailed story. I recommend this to anyone who feels they need a mental vacation for the social triviality of the modern day world. It is a book to help regain perspective."
2,worth a look,"Although one hesitates to give any book by D. H. Lawrence two stars, in this case I must. The Plumed Serpent is no Son's and Lovers. This late Lawrence book is filled with long-winded, pretentious and repetitive passages of ersatz Aztec religious claptrap and equally ill-conceived mysticism about the savage Mexican Indian as a race. Couple these with a sort of proto-fascism, and one has a pretty nasty book. Lawrence's take on gender relations in this world of neo-Aztec revival is equally unattractive. At the same time, there are the descriptive passages of great lyric beauty that are pure Lawrence and some earnest wrestling with questions of individualism versus the commonality of humankind. I didn't like the book, but I'm glad I read it."
2,Read Sons and Lovers instead,"At times lyrically intoxicating, yet mostly just a flawed, rambling novel that gets painfully tedious towards the end, this is definitely one book by Lawrence that you can safely skip. It unfortunately isn't just bad writing - it's also a poor reflection of Mexican society. It makes you wonder how much time Lawrence actually spent in Mexico before he wrote the book. His depiction is stereotypical throughout, and often borders on racism. He seems to have skimmed the surface of Mexican culture, but he hasn't gone much deeper than that."
3,eh,"Mandatory reading for anyone who regards himself as 'politically correct'. Outside of this context, the book doesn't carry much force. Endless observations on Mexico that don't seem too distant from Lawrence's own views; just tweaked enough to fit into his main character's head. A well written first chapter - at the bullfight - disintegrates as we step outside the lives of the characters who show the potential for greater developement and move into a fanatasy realm embodied by one lady's midlife crisis and whether she can reconcile anything that makes up her past. Largely, the book is very linear and won't require much reflection on past pages from the reader as things plummet towards orgiastic."
1,Mindless Narration ...,"One of the most boring books you'd ever read. The language is as rich as it'll ever get, but it used to narrte the muse of someone tethering on the verge of insanity. I've battled through 150 odd pages of the book and can't understand the premise. The ruthless (upto 5 times on every page) use of the word ""naked"" & ""ruddy"" gets irritating. I fail to understand as to why would the author think that people from Mexico are evil and are pulling the earth beings down. A dark & useless book. Stay away!!!"
1,Dismal,"I didn't make it very far through this one - cynical in its tone and rather ignorant in it's portrayal of the characters in Mexico. If you want to learn about latin american consciousness or life, pick up a book by a respected latin author, not this joker. I found it disturbing, but not because of some profound events in the storyline, but rather because of the mental condition of the author, whom I found rather perverse."
5,Old but very good,"While the reproduction on sale on Amazon is dated 2005, the book was originally published in 1981, so it predates Coox's ""Nomonhan"" (1985). Glantz (When Titans Clashed, page 324)calls Drea's book ""the best short study on Khalkin-Gol...Alvin D. Coox, ""Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia"" is an exhaustive study, but is told almost entirely from the Japanese perspective.""Note that its fairly pricey for a slim paperback."
3,"If you have seen the movie Speed, then check out where it came from","I bought this in the kill Chiba 3-pack and while there is NO martial arts in this. It is a very good movie. Sonny Chiba is the train conductor and only has about 5 minutes in the movie btu a great thing to watch is the villian. You may recognoze him as the partner of Michael Douglas in Ridley Scott's Black Rain. He really brings a realism to the character. So literally no action in this movie except for a couple gun shots, but this thing has a very tight plot and will keep you in it all the way.Crash cinema version has watchable picture quality and is widescreened with acceptable English dubbing."
2,Buy more than one. Just in case.,"Bulb maybe got damaged during shipping, but it crumbled to pieces in my hands when I tried to put it into a lamp. Good thing I bought two and was extremely careful with second one."
3,Gift,"I got this as a gift for someone I used to know who requested it, but I haven't talked to them in a long time. I think they liked it though."
1,Panty Rider............ It [is bad]!!,Man I want to tell you this gameis ssssssooooooooo boring. Allyou do is shoot girls with hisgun. Bad game it is.Theworst part is that you take picturesof girls in their pantys.I beat this game like in about 5 minutes. Do not wasteyour money on THIS game like THAT!
4,Reality Check!,"Seems there are a lot of bitter fat people. I can identify. I use to be one of them. The problem is you want your cake and to eat it too...How is that working for you? If you keep doing what you are doing, you will keep getting what you are getting. You have to dramatically change your eating and learn to exercise 1 hour per day 4-6 days per week. You can not do what skinny people do to maintain their weight. Genetics is a B-tch! Deal with it and know that if you want to lose and keep it off you will have to stoping eating the foods you are eating and EXERCISE...Even with weight loss surgery you can and will regain if you revert to eating crappy foods and sitting on your Butt!"
1,FOR WOMEN ONLY,I KNOW MOST DIET BOOKS ARE GEARED TOWARD WOMEN BUT THISBOOK TAKES THE CAKE. THE TITLE SHOULD BE FOR 8 MINUTES FORWOMEN ONLY. AT LEAST HIS FIRST BOOK WAS MORE FOR EVERYONE.
1,Value without value,"The title proports to tell us how to approach project management from a value management perspective. The idea is right, the execution inadequate. The author uses a number of chapters to gloss the surface of ROI measures, etc.; but doesn't make their application clear or usable. I highlighted something in the introduction, then nothing for 60 pages. I quit reading the book after that. This is a topic area that I am very interested in, but I did not find the book useful."
4,INFORMATIVE BOOK,"This was a very informative book and very helpful to me. The only thing was that after awhile it was redundant. For this book and every self-improvement book, you have to remind yourself that you have to put what you read into practice. But all in all this was a great book and I did learn so much from it."
4,Content Great Quality Poor,The content of this book is excellant but the binding came unglued when i first started reading the book.
1,New Guide,Must not have liked it. I gave it away to the Good Will for someone else to read. Not worth it.
1,Exceedingly verbose,"Summary: A person is not obliged to be, feel, or do anything in particular, and should not expect anyone else to be, feel, or do anything in particular. Most the book is filled with self-aggrandizing, drawn out examples of clinic cases, along with some annoyingly sarcastic rhetoric. The authors style of writing and thinking also show some example of being outdated."
4,Happy with purchase,"Book looks to be all there, shipped semi-timely, I'd certainly not hesitate to buy from again."
5,"A simple premise, challenging to do, remarkable in result","A psychologist recommended this book to me when I was having serious trouble handling the challenges in my life. I kept spiraling into deep depressions. Applying this book's principles helped me keep my head above water. But you have to keep practicing these principles, or they stop being effective. These principles become a way of life."
4,state of mind,"I rated this cd 4 stars. I really like it's deep rich tones. It's humorous edge and the hot playing of Keith and crew. It was a bit wordy which kept it from a 5 star rating. I've seen these guys twice and loved both shows. They remind me of a cross between Los Lobos, Robert Cray Band and Hiroshima. I see greatness at work here and I look forword to more of this amazing band."
4,Suburban View,"What a great CD! A very diverse mix of songs...a little Pop, Jaz and R&B, with an added touch of Asian instruments. This is one CD I'm sure everyone would enjoy. This new artist is surely on his way to the top."
4,Valley's View,"When I first listened to the ""State of Mind"" cd I really ""vibed"" off the lyrics. Keith sings about things that people think about on a day to day basis,(consciously or subconsciously --the kind of world we are living in, the future of our children etc.)So not only do you have someone singing your thoughts out loud, the music that accompanies tells the same story instrumentally--it's like you're sharing your thoughts with friends.My favorite song is ""Spiders"" -- from the moment I heard that song I programmed my cd player for repeat. But I'm sure you'll enjoy the entire cd!"
2,Flawed and misguided.,"I had the unfortunate requirement to read this book in a criminology course. Between third person references, uninspired diction, and disjointed construction, this textbook didn't stand a chance. Further, some of the theories presented were so flawed in their reasoning that it made reading parts of chapters a laughable experience. An example: insisting that the gender of a Latin word carries with it social reasoning, or more specifically the word ""victim."" Unfortunately for Walklate, the gender of a Latin noun has nothing to do with society and everything to do with grammar. Here's a free tip for the next edition: the word for ""manliness"" is a ""feminine"" noun also.Avoid this book if you are seeking an accurate, concise, or coherent look into criminology. I'm giving it two stars for the quotes from other authors which were infinitely more useful."
1,UNFORTUNATE,"For a 11+ year collector like myself, this book has too much misinformation to be of much help. Unfortunately, two or three high price dealers do not make a price guide (although EBAY auctions can get higher prices depending who is bidding). Also, many particular items and/or factory lines are missing or sadly underrepresented. Many items or photos are repeated several times. I expected better from the cover photo."
2,"NICE ILLUSTRATIONS, BUT NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR...","NICELY ILLUSTRATED, BUT NOT THE FORMAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. THIS BOOK IS DESIGNED LIKE A COMIC BOOK, AND I WAS HOPING FOR MORE ACTUAL CASE INFO."
3,New Comic books are not Treasures,"I was very dissapointed when this book arrived. I expected a ""Treasury of a Victorian Murder"" Instead I found a black and white comic book. I suspect a guy would like this book, but as a woman I found the title misleading. It's just not how I want to have interesting information about the murder conveyed to me. I was hoping for interesting facts and historical photographs. Guess I should have read the other reviews first!"
5,Murder In The Horse & Buggy Era. Well-Drawn/Written/Documented Book,"Too often, comics are thought of as ""kid stuff"". But Rick Geary has created a well-researched account of the infamous Borden murders in cartoon format, & it is useful for adults & children alike.Filled with illustrations dervived from old photos, maps & blueprints, the reader gets an excellent feel for the events.It is also well-written. Geary makes plain many features & details, such as the oppressively hot Summer temperatures (this kept most people off the street), the single eyewitness that saw Lizzy in the yard, clean & un-bloodstained, & many other documented facts that are neglected or ignored by careless or less objective authors.This early era in American History come across well, & the cartoon approach makes the ""horse & buggy"" period comprehensible to the Internet Generation.The Hipster gives it a Big Thumbs UP!"
4,Did She Or Didn't She?,"I enjoyed reading the history of Lizzie Borden following a 10 km walk in Fall River, MA. I walked by her original home and also saw her home on French Street where she lived after she was acquitted at her trial. This home is now a bed and breakfast and the Innkeeper also filled me in on the details of the home and the crime.You'll learn a lot about history in this time period as well as Fall River and Lizzie's family."
4,Not just a comic book.,"I had to order this book from a local bookstore to be able to obtain a copy.I lost that copy and obtained another one from amazon.At first I looked at it and said ..""well its just a comic book""... Having heard about it by word of mouth I was not aware of this fact. Still I sat down to read it. Its very well put together,is a fairly accurate depiction of the crime,and I was truly glad I took the time to read it.It's very entertaining.Once I lost my copy I had to have another.I have also spent the night at the infamous Bed and Breakfast not once but twice...and I'm planning a third stay if I can find someone brave enough to go with me haha.I want to read every available copy of any book dealing with the crime, so if there are any other books someone might recommend I may not have already come across I would be very grateful."
1,May be a phony one?,This one was published after the author died over one or two years. It's a totally bad story and bad writing. Didn't look like a genuine work of Coughlin's
1,Not William Coughlin!,"After just a few pages I felt 100% certain that William Coughlin did not write this dreadful book. Read any of his Charley Sloan novels (especially ""Shadow of a Doubt"") and you'll see what I mean."
3,"Not as good as his more recent work, but not bad","I got hooked on Coughlin's writing after stumbling across a more recent book of his. Now I'm reading his older works, and I can see how they've improved with time. While not spellbinding, this was still a decent story. There was little or no suspence, if that's what you're looking for, and the ending was rather abrupt and anticlimactic. Not a bad read, though."
1,The title is completely misleading,"To the best of my knowledge, there are freshwater fish and marine (saltwater fish). A book called ""understanding FRESHWATER fish"", so I would have thought, would include information about coldwater AND tropical fish, since both are, in fact, freshwater fish. This book, however contains information about ONLY coldwater fish. The title, therefore, should be, ""understanding COLDWATER fish"". Also, the author is ONLY Dick Mills; Gina Sanford's name appears nowhere in the book, as far as I could find."
5,Bassssss,"Bass Junkie is Phil Klein, European Electrobass guru, who got his start on Dynamix II records with this album. Good stuff."
1,Total crap,I bought one of these and it was dead on arrival. Clock did not work. I returned it to the vendor and they sent me another. Once again dead on arrival. The clock did not work and also the time adjustment dial did not work either. I'm guessing based on my experience that this is just a low quality product all around. Why else would the two that I got be dead on arrival?
4,Pretty sure this is a VHS tape?,If it is then it's a pretty good demo tape of various configurations of the AR/M series weapons with a little bit of AR smithing and AR/M specific history thrown in. It's a good one for the kids to watch as there is plenty of full auto goodness put down range. It makes a good round out to the generic rifle training tapes that so many of the shooting schools (Gunsite and Thunder Ranch come to mind) offer in their pro shops.
5,"It's Mel Brooks, come on!","So, I recently bought a few of the Blu Rays in this pack, but I wanted a complete collection. This has it all and in a good transfer quality. My favorite will always be Spaceballs, but the others are fantastic as well :) If you like Mel Brooks, you'll like the Mel Brooks Collection."
4,I feel like I'm caught in a web...,"...a web between 2 Mel Brooks movies that is:) This and 'The Producers'. This movie is one of thoes comedies when while you're watching it you are thinking: ""this is so stupid!"" but after the movie is over, you think about it a few days later, and start cracking up! My favorite part is probably the end when the camera busts through the wall, that is just too funny! Oh and by the way, if you're a Hitchcock fan, see this movie! If you don't know who Hitchcock is and have never seen his films- then this movie will not be funny to you at all. The only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the other Mel Brooks classic- 'The Producers'. I think that 'The Producers' is probably just about the funniest movie ever, and definatley Brooks' best film, with 'High Anxiety' trailing behind:)"
4,"i got it, i got it, i dont got it","great mel brooks film with a lot of hilarious moments including my favorite part when that patient tells him he's dreaming about werewolfs and he has a pain in his neck. greast scene, I laughed my butt off and theres some parts that are just plain dumb, but all in all I thought it was awesome"
4,High Anxiety,"Mel Brooks strikes again! This time he's attacking every Alfred Hitchcock movie possible. Mel himself plays Dr. Richard Thorndyke and is a noble piece prize award winning psychologist at the Institute for the Very, VERY Nervous. Then there's also many other famous actors and actresses who have starred in many other Mel Brooks films such as Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, and Cloris Leachman. I can't say enough about this movie, but I'm afraid I have to end it right here."
4,I laughed until my sides hurt!,"This was the first Mel Brooks film I ever saw, and I am thrilled to see a new generation enjoying it again. The humor sticks with you and the inside jokes are forever!"
3,"5 star content, defective ""Men in Tights""","Great stuff ... sure some of them were better than others, but all worth a look.Unfortunate that when I finally get a chance to watch, one of the disks is defective.Beyond 30 days ... So, we aren't supposed to buy anything we aren't going to watch within 30 days? I'll look forward to seeing a studio state that recommendation in a press release ... Ha! Still need to contact the studio, to see if they have a replacement policy, so perhaps I'm being too pessimistic"
5,"Plain and Simple, and that's just fine,","This set has some of the funniest movies of all time, and I must say i was not disappointed. The films look great, Silent Movie and Robin Hood especially. Since I had only already bought Blazing Saddles, I didn't mind that some of these were the same as earliar releases. If you don't own many or any Brooks movies, this is a prefect set to get. Lots of laughs, and the discs play great. Some have complained about the little boxes, but I was happy to see them. It beats the often used paper folder style boxsets that Buffy the vampire slayer used(those tended to wear out pretty fast if you watched them as much as i did) while also preventing this set from being unweidlingly huge. Compact sixe for lots of laughs while ensureing that all of your movies are protected. True, there are not many special features, but it's the movies that are the value here, and for this price i cannot complain."
3,"Movies are classic, but if you have the DVD's rethink your purchase","I am a huge Mel Brooks fan, so I already had 7 of these movies on DVD. I was really excited to watch these in the splendor of 1080 but alas I am on my fourth movie and it absolutely feels like these are up-converted films. The quality looks no different then a standard DVD running through the blu-ray player. I have watched Robin Hood, Spaceballs and Blazing Saddles. I just put in To Be or Not To Be which prompted this review. I get the films are between 20 and 40 years old, but my assumption was these would be taken from the original negatives. Anyway, great films but I wouldn't buy this if you already have the DVD's, I am not sure that you will see any difference from what you already have..."
4,Perfect Box ?,This boxset would be perfect if:- Fox weren't too stup!d to zone code one out of its 9 Blu-Ray (and this is Frankenstein Junior we're talking about here!)- Amazon was providing better protection for oversea imports.
2,Long. Plot not compelling.,"This film seems to have a degree of acclaim in certain circles; however, I cannot count myself among those that understand the appeal. The plot, in my opinion, is weak. The characters are two-dimensional. The ending is flimsy. I know that some people quite enjoy this film, so you may wish to decide for yourself based on available reviews and comments. As for myself, I could have found much better uses of my time."
1,What is with the BLANK DVD of Blazing Saddles,"This looks like a ripoff of some kind - absolutely nothing on the Blazing Saddles DVD! No name, no nothing...... completely blank DVD.... Can't afford to put a title on the outside?Love Mel Brooks, but should have bought the individual DVDs..$71.88 - forget it!"
2,"No, Mel Brooks is not a comic genius","More of Mel Brooks's lame silly humor, or what passes for humor. He plays a psychiatrist. So what. It doesn't matter what he plays. This is just a vehicle for his silliness, and it isn't very funny. The first half hour was so lame that I had to walk away. Later I returned to it and it was mildly amusing."
1,How Could They?...,How could Fox release this as a stand alone set only. They must release The Twelve Chairs as a separate entry. It is a minor masterpiece but to pay such a steep price for the set is something that I certainly will not do.
1,What a Sham!,I'm glad that Fox is finally putting Robin Hood: Men in Tights on DVD. But they must be nuts thinking I'm gonna spend $70 for a whole set of movies if I only want the one. That is just ridiculous!
1,Give us the option to buy them separately,"The rating (similar to another review) is not low for the content but for the fact that Fox is so provincial that they haven't offered to release the titles separately. As mentioned in another review, most of us have the titles that have already been made available. Don't force us to buy copies of something we already own. Allow us to pick the titles we'd like to purchase or, at least, have a little common sense to offer a package of the titles that haven't already been released. Did someone at Fox let their 3-yr old put this together? C'mon.Enough said....separate the titles. Think, man...think."
1,What the? Box set..........smmmh,"See this a problem right here, all i was wantin was the Robin Hood : Men In Tights, I been waitin for years, now FOX put it in a box set where i gotta spend $70 for it? Box set before single releases, thats a mess. Yea im mad, I mad cuz its a marketing technique, the box set. I think it be fair to the consumer to sell them single. N 2 of the dvds in this set are already done released. So whats up with that? What Is Up With That?"
1,Mel spoofs Hitch--and gets crapped on by pigeons for his effort,"Very little that is funny or works here. Loved The Producers, though (1968 original version.)Sorry, Mel. I know, comedy is tough to do. If it makes you feel any better, I think Sir Alfred is waaayoverrated."
5,Great collection,"If you like Mel Brooks, get it. Wide screen and everything, despite descriptions to the alternative. It's good to be the king:)"
4,"Yes,they are all anamorphic!","All of the movies are anamorphic widescreen [including ""Young Frankenstein""] but ""Blazing Saddles"" looks to be the older version,without some of the special features that were on the version relaeased last year"
1,never buy again,The video color faded in and out like it was a pirated copy. It also froze up toward the end for a few seconds. I will not buy anymore videos from you.
1,Why Not release The New Films Seperately??,"I've given this release a one star review not because of the films, all of which I love, but because it included several which have been available on DVD for many years and because there are no seperate releases listed for the new-to-DVD films.I have no intention of buying this set. If and when the new-to-DVD films are released on their own, I'll be first in line to buy them."
3,Young Frankenstein is NOT Anamorphic Widescreen,"What else can I say about these movies that other reviews haven't already said? I'm just glad to FINALLY get some of these movies on DVD. For those of you that care, the ONLY DVD in this collection that is not in Anamorphic Widescreen is Young Frankenstein! :-(This is a major disappointment. The DVD's slip cover says it's Anamorphic but it seems that this is a misprint. YF is probably my favorite comedy of all time and I thought that this box set would finally do this movie justice. It appears they have just re-packaged the previous DVD release. Oh well, here's hoping they release the (hopefully one day in the future) Blu-Ray/HD-DVD version in Anamorphic...."
4,Newest BD Release Has No Book,"The purpose of this review is simply to clarify that the original 2009 release of this collection on Blu-Ray came in a large box and included a lavish hardcover book. Thus the reviews complaining that the oversize package is hard to store.The set has recently been re-released at a substantially lower price, packaged in a 9-disk blue plastic case of standard height and width, sans the book. Instead there is a simple 16-page pamphlet tucked into the front cover.The discs and extras are the same as the first release. ""The Producers"" is still not included because it's still not distributed by Fox, as are the 9 included titles."
5,The Mel Brooks Collections,Excellent collection of Mel Brooks movies. Gave it as a gift to my daughter for Chrsitmas and we laughed all day watching the movies. The special sale price made the collection an even better buy. A real enjoyment that will keep you laughing.
5,Entire Mel Brooks Collection for under $30?,"Not much to say here,I saw a great deal of the day on the Mel Brooks blu rays for under $30 and had to pull the trigger. Not one bad movie in the bunch!"
5,It's Mel Brooks,I have not had a chance to watch these yet. I have seen all the movies and wanted the collection. The packaging and product seem to be of very good quality.
5,Mel Brooks Selection,"This box set is essential for any Mel Brooks fan. You can watch how the popular director of such classics as 'Spaceballs' and 'Young Frankenstein' perfected his comedy with these early works such as 'Tweleve Chairs' and 'Silent Movie' all the way up to his more recent work of 'Robin Hood: Men In Tight"". This box set is filled with the most classic comedies of the century."
2,MPeg2 - Quality,"I may had too much expectation and I was hoping these are actually BlueRay quality but they are Mpeg-2 DVD quality that their resolution have been upscaled. What you get is grainy images in most scenes and distortion in shot cuts. To those who will comment about my equipment calibration etc. I must say save your breath, I have top of theline samsung TV which shows most Bluerays great. Just handfull have sud-standard coding and this collection is one of them. This review is not about the movies and is (Story, acting, ...) only about blueray coding."
3,mel brooks,I found that some of the scenes were missing from some of the movies...seem like a cheap bootleg copy...very disappointed.
5,Love Mel Brooks!,I scored this collection on a day when it was on sale and I was stoked!! Worth every penny. And I will never understand why they didn't make A History of the World Part two?!?!
3,Confusing unless you know Hitchcock,"This is a good film with wacky performances from Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, and Madeline Kahn. I think it would be confusing, however, unless you're familiar with Alfred Hitchcock's canon. I bought this for a friend who said she really liked the film and hadn't seen it in years. We watched it together. She laughed more than I."
2,Brooks and Hitchcock Make for a Fruitless Marriage,"An opaque send-up of Alfred Hitchcock's legendary suspense pictures, this probably sounded better on paper than it looks on the screen. It's to be expected for a Mel Brooks movie to be filled to the brim with cheap puns, obvious punchlines and loads of sight gags - that's part of his allure, actually - but this seems thin even by those standards. A basement-level plot might have something to do with that; beneath the dense surface of each of Brooks's best pictures lies a surprisingly rich, inherently funny basic storyline. That's missing in this dim, forced tale of good, evil and jealousy in the hallways a California psychiatric ward. If Blazing Saddles is a novella, High Anxiety is a two-page pamphlet. It's got some value, but not enough to justify a very long sitting."
1,Not so much a review as a question,"If anyone has actually purchased this, what are the special features, (if any), that are included? Just the same stock extras that were with Young Frankenstein?, What about the other films? Any extra stuff with High Anxiety, (maybe an interview with Hitchcock)? And what about To Be or Not to Be? Does that one at least have the *banned* ""Hitler Rap""?I've been a Brooks fan since I was old enough to remember... I've loved most of his stuff, even going back before my time to include 'The 2000 Year-old Man', and 'Get Smart'. I'll buy this set, even though like many others, I already have a couple of the films now, if the studio or Brooks has included the rarities...it will be worth the $70."
1,This Stinks!!,"High Anxiety's the only film needed! Perhaps Mel Brooks needs more BONDAGE & DISIPLINE when releasing DVD product! Nurse Diesel where are you, perhaps your getting the newspaper with your friend with the Tin Teeth in San Francisco..... Or fixing BLOODY MARY with the snappy peppy!Mel get it together and RELEASE "" HIGH ANXIETY "" by itself! PLEASEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ridiculous packaging YET AGAIN,"Considering the fact that most people who would buy this in the first place are 99% of the time using appropriate storage means ie. a movie/book case or shelving that accommodates a ""COLLECTION""... I find it outrageously annoying that YET AGAIN we are offered a collection of movies using packaging that cannot possibly fit IN said storage facilty. I LOVE Mel Brooks films. LOVE them! But I REFUSE to purchase this set becuase I am sick of trying to stuff stupidly packaged Blu-ray sets in places other than where my ""COLLECTION"" goes! Grrrrr! Knock it off with the stupidity! THINK OF THE COLLECTORS.... please note the term COLLECTOR alluding to collecTION alluding to STORAGE. Release the *#$@ movies separately and I will buy my favorites. But I'll chew glass before I buy one more stupidly packaged movie set!!!"
1,Low-Grade Bat Guano,"If you like movies that get reviews titled ""Low-Grade Bat Guano,"" this movie is for you.All others, please beware."
3,Don't sell ALL your old ones...,Buyer beware: the Blazing Saddles included here is the older release without ANY of the special features on the 30th anniversary edition
3,More could not be expected.,"The Blu-Ray edition of High Anxiety is devoted to Mel Brooks fans who did not matter seeing the departure of Gene Wilder from his scripts and casts. The film itself is not bad, but it is not brilliant, with some good moments but also with a lot, perhaps unintended movie clichés.The Blu-Ray has a decent picture but it seems that the original film elements could not cater for more. In addition, sound quality is only fair. No improvements over the last DVD edition can be perceived."
5,Best collection!,This DVD collection is hilarious! It was a lot cheaper buying it here on Amazon than at the big box store!!
5,Very Subtle If You Didn't See Hitchcock Films,"I frequently give this movie as a gift.....That's the case this time. If people have seen ""The Birds"", ""North by Northwest"" or ""Vertigo"" they get it and are rolling in the aisles. If they don't know Alfred's work, they just don't get it."
5,Mel Brooks!,What else can you say. You love him or you don't. It will be interesting to hear what they say about these movies in 50 years. It's hard for movies to be politically correct and funny and Mel just didn't seem to care. I'll bet that Sacha Baron Cohen has this in his collection.
4,a great evening of entertainment,"Any thing by Mel Brooks is fantastic. He is possibly one of the greatest comedy writer, director, producers, etc. to ever live."
5,Mel Brooks,"100% as i remember, and all the movies are going to keep me busy for quite some timethank youBernie"
4,Hitchcock 'Owned',Sure it's over-the-top but it's also very good. There isn't a weak spot in the cast. The psychopathic killer is a personal favorite. Try to find all the Hitchcock film references. This movie won't disappoint.
4,A great collection.,"I've been a fan of Mel's films for as long as I can remember. Since I hadn't had any of these on bluray yet this was the perfect opportunity to add to my collection. It's got a good collection of most of his major works and it included. the Twelve Chairs. A film I had not yet seen, but thoroughly enjoyed.My one recommendation to this collection would be that it included the original The Producers."
2,"The movies are great, but...","The movies were great, I really liked the movies. The following two things went ""wrong"" with ordering:- The product itself was a severely worn down torn package, personally, in this state I wouldn't sell it second hand.- I payed about 35 euros for the collection and in total an additional 35 euros in taxes.All in all, I wouldn't have done it if I knew this would happen."
4,Great Comedy,I enjoyed High Anxiety very much - I happen to be a fan of Mel Brooks and all his movies. It was entertaining and funny. I would suggest it to anyone.
5,Great Fun,"It was a gift for my son and he loved it. I may borrow it for my own enjoyment, since I saw all of the original movies."
3,What happened to The Producers?,"The Amazon sale information does not include a comprehensive list of contents, I had to dig that out of one of the excellent reviews. Apparently the set does not include THE PRODUCERS. Without that masterpiece the set is sadly lacking."
1,Do Not buy Bluray-no better than regular dvd,"Warning! The bluray does not have any improved picture quality over the regular dvd.Great film! But if you already own the dvd, don't upgrade. Young Frankenstein is worth upgrading to Bluray, but not this one."
4,great!,Great box set! Gave it 4 stars because it was only discs. no booklets or anything else. but the price was awsome when I got it so made it worth it
5,TIGHT TIGHTS,ITS ABOUT TIME IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS TO GET MY HANDS ON A REGION ! COPY OF ROBIN HOOD MEN IN TIGHTS
5,Mel Brooks eight dvd collection is ultra funny and finally on region 1 dvd.What took so long?,"The Mel Brooks boxed set contains some of his funniest masterpieces.I have all the movies ,plus others on region two.I bought this set as a gift.I know the movies and they are great.Thank you Fox video!!! Now can you release each movie seperately,so the people who have some of these titles dont have to buy the whole box set.Say while your at it how about releasing FLOWER DRUM SONG,AND YENTL ON DVD PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks Stewart L."
1,Had To Return It,"It is a great picture, one I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys Mel Brooks humor. But the DVD was damaged even though it was suppose to be new. It had an obvious scratch on it and hung up in several places. I notified Amazon of this problem and they sent me a label to send it back to them which meant I had to make a trip to the local UPS facility. They told me they would credit my account but would not send a replacement because it had been shipped by a sub contractor. Makes me think twice before buying any more DVD's."
3,the producers of this set...,"have left out The Producers, Mel's first and probably always foremost! better to pay 50 brooksaroos for that film and 10 only for this box of dreck (relatively schpeaking)"
4,a real mood enhancer,i first seen this film when i was 15 and i thought it was absolutely hilarious the dialog with the old bespectacled professor at the beginning of the film is hysterical and when mel gibson walks in his room thinking he has been murdered and he jumps up and says oh i always sleep like that it scares the hell out of people is a comedic gem and when mel brooks confides in dr harvey that he has high axiety and he says he will take his secret to the grave and then walks out the room and shouts down the corridor hey everyone guess whos got high anxiety this is a comedy treasure
4,Shame about the missing items,"But the films that are present are classics and presented in great quality. Space balls seems to be the most in need of remastering, but the comedic quality of these films far surpass any technical limitations."
5,Mel Brooks at his best,"My entire family has loved and quoted this movie for 20 years. If you have ever seen The Birds, the laughs in this movie will chase you down the street in hysterics. The great ensemble of Cloris Leachman, Harvey Korman, Mel Brooks and Madeline Kahn deliver kooky characters, constant sight gags, and a whole plot (unlike some of Mel's movies.) I paid $5 for this trip down Funny Lane."
3,Red Crayola-'God Bless The Red Crayola And...'(Collectables),"Originally released in 1968,this was their second lp as well as the follow-up to 'The Parable Of Arable Land' CD reissue(see my review).Possibly a mite too strange for most.Some of the tracks I sort of dug were ""Say Hello To Jamie Jones"",the acappella ""Music"",""The Shirt"",the quirky ""Victory Garden"" and ""Big"".A couple of these tunes are even too weird for me.Some very experimental psych(if you'd care to call it that).Recommended for '60's throw-backs, the yippie-hippie type,tree huggers,acid freaks and burn outs everywhere.Just might appeal to fans of Muslimqauze,Fifty Foot Hose,Terry Riley and perhaps Silver Apples."
4,Danny Phantom...GBA...,I like the game..it was a bit tough at first..and thru a few of the levels..but i would recommend it ...a bit older kids though...8 and above...Great Price here....
3,"Excellent Work, Nickelodeon!",That Phantom is much better when played in this game. Danny makes another Good mission Accomplished once again from Vlad Masters. Impressive game!
5,now you're just showin off....,"ben harper has struck gold again. anyone who loves (nobody just 'kinda likes' him) ben's awesome gift for writing a quality tune will adore his new effort. by guesting with the blind boys it was always goin to be a lil bit different than his previous efforts. but weren't all ben's albums varying? stick this in that already bulging collection and enjoy some heart felt, soulful and delightfully touching music"
4,Excellent,"I got this within a matter of days, in the condition it was stated to be in and couldn't have asked for anything better! Thanks for the quality service and product."
3,"A very dissapointing, selfish romance","Beautiful and ruthless Jessica Wakefield constantly tries to get classmate, and star basketbal player: Todd Wilkins, to get intrested in her, though, its perfectly clear he likes her twin sister, Elizabeth. I mean, get a clue! The selfish schemes Jessica plays are not the least amusing, as a matter of fact, it's devastating! I mean, get to the romance already! Though I have to say, it was a good portray of sisters these days, and what I read was just plain sad! At the end, though, i have to say! It was worth it!Im rating this book 3 stars, because it had both its ups and its downs. Of course, this is just my opinion, read it for yourself! You might even love it!"
2,Dull,"The plot was kind of trite, the twins are described as ""drop-dead"" gorgeous and boy-crazy Jessica is flirting with the guy Elizabeth likes. And the setting, ever-sunny, warm, perfect Sweet Valley gets old after a while. Maybe the twins should have been plainer and have occasional lousy weather. If girls hope to have a good body image realistic expectations, they'd be better off reading about the Baby-Sitters' Club, where the characters are physically plainer, but more interesting with realistic plots."
4,Unusually vivid teen romance,"None of the best-selling followups ever came close to this first SVH book. Identical teen twins, the studious good-girl doormat Elizabeth and her devious, sexually upfront sister Jessica, are pitted against each other for the love of personality-challenged jock Todd. Will Elizabeth's inherent goodness and true love win out over her naughty sister? You have one guess. But Jessica's manipulations and Elizabeth's masochism make this an unusually enthralling teen romance, and the twins gimmick, a staple for the series, works exceptionally well in this volume. It's quintessentially American, but not quite as sexist as it sounds."
2,Beyond dumb.,"Two beautiful blond girls with amazing looks and talent live in the sun-kissed town of Sweet Valley High. They are adored by their friends, families, and let's face it, the world. Yeah right. Elizabeth, Ms. Goody-Two-Shoes, lets her twin sister Jessica worm and scheme her way into everything. Liz is supposed to be a brain, but is instead, a whiny pushover who can't help but be boring. At least Jessica is selfish and manipulative to even things out. Um, if you think that's how people live in real life...well, you need to move to Sweet Valley."
4,Get ready for some drama in Sweet Valley...,"My daughter is 13 and is finishing up the Sweet Valley Twins series, so I wanted to read the first couple of books of the High series before she did. I wanted to make sure it was appropriate for her to read. After going to our local library, I got this book. It took me a few hours to read ( it's slightly over 100 pages ) and I enjoyed it. It took me back to high school and the drama that surrounds family and friends. There are several ""lessons"" learned in this first book. All in all, I'm pleased. I hope my daughter will enjoy it as much as I did. :)"
1,Not the best book I've read,"I'm sorry but this has to be the worst book in the entire SVH series. How many identical sixteen year old girls are that beautiful in real life. Puh-leaze. Perfert size six figures, eyes the color of the Pacific Ocean, hair spun like gold. I can't believe how ridiculous this book was. Are we supposed to believe that two sisters who are really that close would fight over the same boy! As an identical twin myself my twin sister and I would never fight over the same guy the way the Wakefield sisters were. And Todd and Elizabeth have got to be the two stupidiest people throughtout the book. Instead of admitting their feelings to one another we have to sit through Todd pining away for Elizabeth and vice versa. Why didn't they just open their mouths up to begin with? The other books in the series are much better than this drivel."
2,They ruined it,"I went to my local bookstore and saw they were re-releasing Sweet Valley High and I was excited because now I could finish my collection, I had no idea they were rewritten and when I was reading one of the books in the store I was shocked to realize this. I almost flipped out.I can see the whole email thing and cell phones but changing story lines and characters and other stuff wasn't necessary they pretty much rewrote the second book. This is very upsetting.They didn't need to change their sizes from a 6 to a 4. Teenage girls already have issues about that and now they are trying to say a size 6 is too fat? Since when?"
2,Stick to the original,"As a self-proclaimed SV addict I followed the series throughout my teenage years and began re-reading them well into my late 20's and early 30's for nostalgia's sake. I was so excited about the re-release, yet after I read the first book I was very disappointed. It's as though the authors are trying to hard to compete with Gossip Girls. I didn't buy the updates and ""modern"" language and I doubt teenagers will either. As much as I would love to see this series continue to grow (and I am anticipating Sweet Valley Confidental or Sweet Valley Heights) I think the biggest fanbase will be readers like me- those looking for a bit of nostalgia."
3,Double Love,"Sweet Valley High has been by far my most favorite series of books to read. I enjoy reading the many unique, odd, and sometimes even strange situations the Wakefield sisters encounter in Francine Pascal's writing. It is a good book for young adults, but not one of the best in the series of SV. However, don't let this stop you, because this book can still definitely leave you amused and satisfied."
3,Sweet but not real sweet,"Double Love is a good book, but there are better in the series.Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield are two charming 16 year old twins that look exactly alike, but their personalities are very different. In this book the main problem is over Todd, a boy that the two twins both like. Other minor problems are also in the book, such as Steven's mysterious behaivor and why their dad keeps hanging around Marianna West, a new lawyer at his firm.Of course there is back-stabbing and treachery, but what else could you expect?Double Love is a good book, but run-of-the mill. There is nothing really outstanding about it. But if you are a Sweet Valley fan, you'll probably like it."
5,awesome!,"I got this spray at my acupuncturists office and I haven't looked back since! My husband uses it for shoulder pain and back pain, I like it for headaches and even menstrual cramps (just spray or roll on the painful site). I highly recommend this spray."
5,cryoderm spray,Stuff works great on my tennis elbow and wife's back muscles . Friend at work let me try hers that she gets from her doc. I found it on Amazon fir half the price she pays . She now buys hers from Amazon.
4,My mom feels so much better now!,"I've tried alot of other pain reliever but until CryoDerm, nothing relieved my Mom's lower back pain from arthritis. So you can imagine how happy I felt when she told me it feels cool after a few seconds of spraying her back and relieved the pain enough to stop taking Alleve every morning. I also got her a gel-filled heating pad that wraps around her waist and back which she puts over the spray application. So we're back to smiling again, thank heavens!The only improvement I hope for is that it relieves her pain 100%. Right now relief is something she is grateful for, however. Otherwise, I would've given it a 5-star.What I like about it is that it is all-natural, no added toxic chemicals or other additives. So thank you, makers of CryoDerm!!"
5,Amazing product,"I purchased this product to help with lower back pain I got from doing yard work. My back hurt for two weeks, everyday. The same day I purchased it, I received notification it was shipped. The CryoDerm was packaged very nicely and works amazingly. NO MORE PAIN! CryoDerm is definitely stronger than BioFreeze."
5,KEEPS ME GOING,"I HAVE PAIN FROM MY JAW TO MY CALF AND THINK THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER TRIED. SOMETIMES IT CURES A PAIN COMPLETELY, MOSTLY IT RELIEVES PAIN FOR SEVERAL HOURS. I WOULDN'T BE WITHOUT IT!"
5,Love the Cryoderm,My chiropractor started my on the product. It is fantastic. I even use it for my migraines. I never leave home with out this in my purse.
5,Cryodern,I love this stuff....it's great for all kinds of pain. Sometimes I have neck and shoulder pain causing headaches and I spray the area with the Cryoderm and it soothes the pain. Thanks for prompt shipping.
3,works omewhat,it worked somewhat for pain discomfort. However my problem needed physical therapy. I was dealing with more than pain management.
2,Biofreeze is better,"I bought the Cryoderm spray because my mother swears by it, but I haven't been nearly as satisfied with it as she is. While a spray can help you reach areas you can't as well with a roll-on, it also can make a bit of a mess and get to areas you don't want it to. But it just doesn't work as well as Biofreeze, which I've gone back to. Biofreeze goes on easily and the scent disappears (which would be nice for Tiger Balm, which is the best but the smelliest), and is a far better product than Cryoderm."
1,A real stinker of a book..:(,"I probably would never have had this book in hand if not for buying it for 25 cents at a tag sale..I am a loyal Red Sox fan, have been for many years and thought I would give it a browse..after the first few chapters I found it to be clearly a ME ME ME, I, I, I, sort of book, Damon loves Damon, that is one thing that is clear in the book... after he left the Red Sox high and dry for the almighty more $$$$$ I really had no use for him..he got what he deserved the first time he came back to Fenway and stood up at the plate..you cant be a Judas and expect to be welcomed with open arms. A badly written book, Im glad I did not spend any more then 25 cents for it, in fact I never finished it. A book to read about the Red Sox in 2004 is ""Faithful"" written by Stephen King..a fine book and very informative.."
2,ehh....,"I am a huge Red Sox fan and I used to be a big Johnny Damon fan too. After reading this book, I dont see him in the same light. He is constantly talking about how he is such a great player, how the team couldnt win without him and blah blah blah. He loves himself a bit too much. It gets a bit boring throughout the book, and I found that hard and odd considering last season was very exciting. Having Damon talk about how they would have won more games if he had played those games shows that he is NOT a team player. Don't bother wasting money on this. This book was obviously written just to make a quick buck....."
1,Johnny is a Jerk,"Yes, that's right. My mistake as a die hard Red Sox fan was reading this book. I used to think of him as a smart intelligent baseball player, but after reading his autobiography, I flinch each time he steps up to the plate.REASONS WHY JOHNNY IS A JERK...he compares himself to Ted Williams, gets pissed off he didn't make the All Star team, admits for using a seperate cell phone for his one-nights stands (while mentioning his two year old twins only twice in the entire book....HE MENTIONS HIS HAIR more often that that), and solely credits himself for winning the Championship...so much for team player!I am still a die hard Sox fan, and after reading Damon's book, I wish he never got a ring!"
3,"Decent read, although not all facts are straight.",Overall this was a pretty good read. I enjoyed hearing about baseball from a player who is not afraid to tell it like it is and is not full of himself. Damon's book makes for a light read that is entertaining and fun. What kept this from getting a higher rating from me is that there are several times where the author stretches the truth to make the book more exciting. In one instance he turns a game winning double into a walk off home run (pg 159). I was at this game and know for a fact that it did not happen the way the author tells it. Overall though worth reading.
3,Not as good a writer as ball player :-(,"This book prooves the theory that looks aren't everything. He's so hot (even now without the beard) but from reading this book, he's not that smart. So talented on the field but this book is like it's been written by a kid back in junior high - if that. He's repeated himself several times over and over and as another reviewer said, it seems as if this was written purely because of the Sox's win only. I love Johnny dearly, but stick to playing ball and away from books."
2,Wow...he is an idiot (or whoever wrote it),"This book was written like a 17 year old suffering from ADHD. It jumps around and repeats itself so much, it's difficult to follow an even flow. He comes off a little like a braggart and kind of a dunce with very little depth to him. Its too bad, I like him as a ball player, but the book made my head spin."
2,A Lousy Book,"Johnny Damon seems like a really great guy, but this book is pretty darned lousy.My biggest problem with it is that he is too nice, and says nothing negative about anyone. After a while, I got tired of reading page after page about how every 60 win team was scrappy and difficult to beat as well as how every journeyman ballplayer that he ever played against or with was so talented and had the best ""stuff"" he had ever seen. There was nothing interesting and this was a waste of my time."
4,OK Book,"Damon's book is not a challenge. It's not all that deep. But, it gives a great inside look into the Red Sox as they pursued the championship. It also tells a little of a ballplayers career and history.It's an entertaining book and it's an easy and fast read and worth the time.Also, read 3 Nights in August."
1,so disappointing...,"I am glad I read this book before I saw Johnny Damon in a Yankee uniform, because the book is boring and could have been written by a tenth grader. Damon is in love with himself, talks trash about his ex-wife and the whole book sounds like a bad tv interview. I can happily look at Johnny Damon in Yankee gear and know it's no loss to the Red Sox."
2,Stick To Baseball,Idiot is a good title for this book because it's written more like a high school dropout than a high school graduate. Damon gives very little real insight about the game or the team other than to indicate how cool he is. Hard to believe he even had a ghostwriter for this crap.
3,"Johnny's Right, He Is An Idiot","Up until I read this book, he was my favorite Red Sox player. Now, not so much. He truly is an idiot and a self centered one at that. No one should speak of the mother of their children in the way he does in this book. His children may read this someday and what will they think. He should be ashamed of himself."
1,Even I can write a book!,"The only thing I got from this book, other than the fact that Johnny Damon thinks very, very, very highly of himself, is that anyone can get a book published...even if there is no meaningful content!I love the Red Sox and I still love Johhny Damon as a baseball player, but as an author, Mighty Johnny has struck out!"
2,Disappointed,"Johnny came off as being very ""full of himself"", something of which I didn't think he was. Like other diehard Sox fans, I was very disappointed in this book.It was actually a hard read for me as I had a problem getting through it due to Johnny's conceit.Not a book that I would recommend to others."
4,Definitely worth it if your a Johnny Damon fan....,"Im a huge red sox fan, so this book was one I was looking forward to. And I was not disappointed by it. It was writen well considering a baseball player wrote it. (although he did have help) I thought that although it was mostly revolving about Johnny Damon's life, it was very good. Johnny Damon is one of my favotire players and anyone else intersted in learning stuff about him that they don't talk about on the radio or TV, I would highly suggest it."
2,Not what I was expecting....sorry!,"I bought the DVD hoping for another good work like their Hell Freezes Over DVD, however, it wasn't such. The audio on the DVD lacks quality. I purchased it, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry."
3,The concert is good but we need Don Felder there!,"I bought the DVD and also watched the live concert in Atlanta but the Eagles are not the same without the best guitarist in the band, Don Felder. No comparison with Hell Freezes Over granted they played 30 songs here. Don Henley sounded tight (I guess since he's older...) The replacement for Don Felder is never a comparison. 'I can't tell you Why' was different without Felder's accompaniment (Timothy Schmidt did a great job but his performance at HFO is better). Felder's rendition of Hotel California was awesome at HFO and the guy that replaced him just did not hit it off....this concert was good but HFO was far much better. Jow Walsh was great but jamming with that new guy is not the same as when he's jamming with Felder...Good concert in general but the originality (without Felder) was missing! Not an original band anymore...."
3,Henley Released It - Of Course It's Great!,"O.K. I'm passed through the title sequence...I love the Eagles, or else I wouldn't be writing. Joe & Don Felder had a deep respect & great love for each other for all these years. Beyond the spoken word on the extras - there's a giant hole in the sprit of this cd!! All you need to do is review old highlights of Walsh & Felder jamming together in the old days. It's none of my business - Felder may be in the wrong ( but I doubt it!) but this cd lacks the spirit of those classic Walsh/Felder moments! Of course Joe won't say anything (contractual, along with his sobriety!) but come on!!!Stuart (sp?) and Joe had all the chemistry of Alka Seltzer dropped in the tummy after Italian food - effective but uninspired to the bitter end!! Sigh........"
4,Great DVD,"Great DVD for any fan of The Eagles/Joe Walsh. A few critical points need to be touched on.....First-Joe, you wrote better songs before rehab. Nobody cares if you're taking it 'One Day At A Time'. Second-Glen, you're no substitute for Randy Meisner on ""Take It To The Limit"". Let it go.Last-Give the poor sap on guitar who is shuffled off to the dark side of the stage some acknowledgment. The guy holds his own against Frey and Walsh and more than carries his weight.Aside from the above stated, it's a great concert that I'd rank up there beside ""The Last Waltz"". Great sound and visual quality. Good camera work. Great selection of songs (except for the newer crap). Still would've been nice to hear songs like ""Ol'55"", ""Doolin Dalton"" ""Out Of Control"" etc...."
4,The Eagles Go On & On &On !,"As a great fan of the Eagles I quite enjoyed this DVD set, althoughsomthing seemed missing,perhaps the other original member which would have just made it complete. Their music still has the same quality as it ever did and and although many years have passed they still draw the crowds. What more can you expect from a band of professional musicians. I guess there is no stopping them and that first reunion seems to keep going on."
3,The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne,"The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From MelbourneVERRY GOOD,MY TO 10 BANDSTHANKS."
5,What a great concert that is produced to perfection,This is a great concert with excellent quality audio. I had read good things about the production quality of this DVD and it was better than I expected. I previously purchased a Blu-Ray version of the Rock & Roll HOF 25 year concert and was impressed by the audio engineered product and when I heard the Eagles I failed to find much difference in quality even if it was not Blu-Ray.The Eagles have been around long enough to feel comfortable on stage and their relaxed professional persona shines in this concert. This is one DVD I have watched again and again without growing tired. This is a flawless well edited and well produced DVD and they just don't get much better.
4,Eagles Farewell Tour,"The DVD was supposed to be new and there are two songs that have problems so that they can not be watched. I would like to have this replaced if there were some mechanism for that. The music is a personal favorite of mine, but these problems are very annoying. I'm not sure what type of quality control was available."
2,I messed up.,After I got this item in I realized that it is for a HD DVD. Is there anyway I can return it? I have no HD DVD and the only way I can watch it is by trying to find a HD DVD player.
5,Worth every penny,"OMG I can watch this over and over on a big wide screen with 6 channels audio total cost $25, but try to see in concert for less than $150!"
3,What Sound ???,Great video quality. Sound I would rate a 3 star. I am just not happy with the sound quality. They have paid so much attention to video and they have not taken the same kind of care with the sound.
5,Eagles Live in Australia-Awesome DVD,I've been waiting a long time for the Eagles to do a concert DVD and the wait was well worth it. They do most of their hits in DTS 5.1 surround and they never sounded better. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who loves great music. I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.
3,Sound alarm,"This is a great performance by the Eagles in great visual detail (though I'm not sure we need that kind of detail after performers turn 60.) My problem is with the sound quality which is not up to even regular DVD standards. The sound on my disk is very edgy and irritating on high quality playback equipment, nothing like their previous DVDs. I don't know if it is possible to just get a bad audio disk but I find it too unnatural to play, except to ""see"" the visual detail and color."
5,Soar Like an Eagle!,"The DVD to ""Farewell 1 Tour"" by the Eagles is OUTSTANDING! I watched the t.v. coverage of this concert, and had to own it! The energy of the crowd in Melbourne beckons/allows you to become a part of the whole. If you are an Eagles fan, believe me, you will absolutely LOVE this concert! The group has never sounded better, and their writing, timing and overall performance skills have gotten even better over the years!God Bless you Eagles! Looking forward to Farewell 2!Cynthia SteadPortland, OR"
1,Audio issues,"I had a strange experience with this dvd. The first couple of times I played this disc it looked and sounded amazing. I have a new Toshiba 3rd generation HD-DVD player and Optoma HD80 1080p projector. Now, I cannot get any audio to play from this disc and have returned it as defective. In case you are wondering, yes I am aware their is a DTS vs PCM audio setting in the disc menu. Weird! Too bad, it sounded good when it worked."
1,Sell-Outs,Don Henley & Glenn Frey are just a couple of sell-outs. It's no longer about the music. It's just $$$ to them.What a poor performance. They looked like they didn't want to be their. 3 of the 5 Eagles have now moved on maybe they should too.
1,Wish I could hear the music,This is the 2nd Eagles Farewell Tour that was sent to me. I returned the first set because neither CD would play in either of my 3 CD players. A second set was sent and the same problem. I am returning the 2nd set requesting a full refund.
1,Blank tape,We purchased this tape and when we received it - it was blank. We returned it and are still waiting to see if our original method of payment will be reimbursed. We have ordered other DVD's and they were ok.
1,It does NOT come with CLOSED CAPTIONING!,The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne (2005)does NOT provide closed captioning!!!
5,Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live from Melbourne,"My Husband and I enjoyed this DVD of the Eagles tremendously!! I was not a real fan of the Eagles before and my husband told me to just listen to them for a moment and I did, and NOW I AM A BIG FAN of them. The music is SUPER and I just LOVED the song ""One Day at a Time"" by Joe Walsh - ALL the songs were GREAT! Actually, This was the first time I ordered something from Amazon.com and I thought I was buying a CD. [...] Thanks for the opportunity to let you know my thoughts. Ireneski"
5,Best concert DVD ever,"If you are a fan of the Eagles this DVD is a must!Excellent sound & content, all the hits."
5,Extremely Pleased,I saw this tour televised on WDIV and tried to record it in HD but I didnt have a good over the air antenna set up at the time! The recording was choppy and I was disappointed I missed the chance for an HD copy of it. The DVD I purchased from Amazon is almost as good as the HD as I have an upconverting player and the audio is excellent. Any Eagles fan would be pleased with this purchase.
1,Eagles Farewell Tour DVD,I received this DVD and it didn't work at all. I am still waiting for my refund two weeks later.
1,Eagles DVD Corrupt,"After receiving two of these DVDs and trying to play them on three different DVD players, I gave up and asked for a refund. It is apparent these DVDs were corrupt and could not play on any DVD players. Amazon apparently received a batch of bad DVDs. I bought the two DVD version of this Eagles concert at Barnes & Noble and they worked fine."
1,"Technically Excellent, But A Sterile And Boring Performance","Get this release if you want to see a bloated Don Henley sing and not play the drums that often.Buy it if you don't like Don Felder and want to hear his clone Steuart Smith!Don't purchase this if you prefer Randy Meisner on bass and his excellent vocal on ""Take It To The Limit"".Otherwise, buy their all of their albums or greatest hits. No offense to Joe Walsh, but this reminds me of an extremely polished and professional oldies act on PBS."
1,Wrong regional DVD code !!!!,"It's unbelievable but Amazon has sent to me a DVD with the wrong regional DVD code!!!I live in the Netherlands, I have ordered the DVD from the Netherlands, Amazon has sent the DVD to my address in the Netherlands, but I am not able to play the DVD because it has the wrongregional DVD code!!! Hopefully Amazon reacts on this review.Cees Varossieau, Waalwijk, The Netherlands"
5,Eagles Farewell,"It's amazing that these guys can make another dvd that I LOVE! I thought that they couldn't top ""When Hell Freezes Over"". This one is as equally good. They jam and rock a little more in this one and the horn section ROCKS! Invite some friends over and enjoy three hours of incredible entertainment!"
5,Eagles still awesome,"The Eagles have put together a great show. The music is great, and there is LOTS of it. This 2 CD set was well worth every penny! After viewing it, I ordered another copy for a Christmas gift."
2,Did not play on my Xbox 360 HD player,"The menue pops up and then the disc freezes on pressing of any button. Not sure if only my disc is defective or a whole series. This is the first of 9 HD DVD's i have a problem with.update: same problem with the replacement of disc sent by amazon. It does not play on the xbox 360. will now contact manufacturer of disk and microsoft for potential firmware update of player.update 2: FIRMWARE UPDATE; on nov 30 a message flashed over my screen , that an ""update is available for this game"" i updated and the disk is now playing wonderfully. another great bonus of playing hd-dvd's over the xbox 360, how easy it is to update firmware!! would like to change the rating to 5 now because the concert is superb."
5,The Eagles Soar High!!,Excitement from start to finish. The audio and video were exceptional. These guys can still provide the harmony and musical ability we've come to expect. This is a great investment and a must have for all Eagles fans.
5,Love the Eagles,The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne DVD was everything I expected and more. Many hours of entertainment for me all the way down to my teenage grandsons. If you enjoy the Eagles this is the best ever.
5,One of the best Concerts on DVD,"I dont have one complaint about the concert. The sound quality is excellent, picture is really awesome, and the lighting for the stage is really amazing. The Eagles are truly one of the greatest rock bands out there. This DVD like Journey's Live in Houston concert are concerts that any rock fan out there should have."
3,Freyd in Melbourne,A real disappointment. Glenn Frey controlled this show and seemed to use a Dick Clark-type dart board to select the repertoire of too many non-Eagles songs. The crowd was very responsive but hardly selective either. Fortunately Joe Walsh is a wonderful entertainer. Don Henley seemed to just go through the motions. A real letdown from Hell Freezes Over.
5,Older but Still Sound Great!,"I love this band!Glenn Fry's new song ""No More Cloudy Days"" is fantastic. Don Henley sounded great - especially loved ""Dirty Laundry,"" and his dedication to (you'll have to watch to find out).Joe Walsh stole the show with his new song ""One Day at a Time.""Really phenomenal concert.I love ""You Belong to the City"" - just love it!!The saxophone throughout and Joe Walsh ripping at the end was spectacular.Wonderful camera work, capturing some beatiful Aussies and the live action.The other lead guitar player, Steuart Smith, wields the guitar like a master technician.What a classic classic rock and roll band!Will hate to see them go as the world decends into world tyranny and rap."
4,"Older, wiser, and better, all in one package.","They are all older and it shows but not as badly as on some rockers from the same era. The interviews were a terrific part of the dvd as you heard them, wiser, more committed to the music and to the experience of sharing the music with those who love to listen and to sing along with them. If you don't like the Eagles, you probably didn't buy this. I grew into whatever passes for my maturity with them as part of the background music. I like them still and I think they are better musicians now and certainly wiser about what the excesses of ""the Life"" can do to one's self."
4,Great concert,"Pop this baby in your DVD player and turn on the DTS. This is a great concert all around, these guys can still play and sing. Watch for many of their classic songs such as New Kid In Town and Desperado, as well as some new ones.The real treat though is the sound, the harmonies are crisp, and the music is very clear. Bring on Farewell II!"
4,Eagles,This is another DVD I bought to exercise with. It has a good variety of tempo and is great to see.
4,The Eagles Are Better Than Ever,"An excellent concert & to be enjoyed in HD is another plus. The Eagles actually seem better in their old age now. It must be maturity. Although, the HD DVD did not have camera angle shots as an added bonus, it was still produced well & is an excellent item for the DVD library."
5,Amazing HD-DVD,"This concert only made me wish that more bands would produce HD-DVD concerts. The sound and PQ is amazing. If you have a decent digital surround system which is set up correctly, you will feel like you are in the front row watching the concert live. You can never go wrong with the Eagles, and this HD-DVD does not disappoint fans."
1,Eagles Farewell 1 tour - Corrupted Discs,I received the first disc I ordered and found it to be corrupted. The concert didn't play. I exchanged it for a new one and the same thing happened. I returned the second one and haven't purchased another.
1,Not Satisfied,I purchased (2) copies of this DVD for myself and a friend. Neither of us has had any luck at playing it on our DVDs.
1,This CD Does Not Work at ALL!!!!!!,This CD Does not play on any of my DVD players!! I am very disappointed in Amazon!!!!!
3,HORNS & FIDDLE?,"THE EAGLES ALONG WITH AEROSMITH ARE AMERICA'S GREATEST BANDS. THE FAREWELL 1 BROADCAST WAS OK. DON FELDER WHO LAUNCHED THE EAGLES TO A HARDER EDGIER SOUND AFTER JOINING THE BAND IN'73 WAS DEFINATELY MISSING ON THIS PARTICULAR TOUR. ALSO ADDING HORNS TO ALL THE SONGS AND THE ADDITION OF A FIDDLE [VIOLIN!!] JUST TOTALLY SCREWED UP THE SONGS. IF IT'S NOT ON THE ORIGINAL RECORDING, DON'T ADD INSTRUMENTS. LISTEN TO THE LIVE DISC ON THE SELECTED WORKS CD AND THE 1980 EAGLES LIVE CD TO SEE HOW VALUABLE FELDER IS. THIS DVD WILL BE FOR DIE-HARDS, I'VE PRE-ORDERED IT, BUT GLENN & DON NEED TO RE-FOCUS THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC IN CASE THEIR IS A FAREWELL 2 TOUR."
2,Still Saying Good-bye,"I remember in the 80's, when the Eagles broke up. There was a quote in People Magazine from Glenn Frey. It said something to the effect of, ""The Eagles are a young band. You'll never see us getting back together for the 'Lost Youth and Greed Tour'."" I guess you should never say never. They fire Don Felder and still carry on with this tour. Sorry, it has turned into a Vegas act. How many side musicians do you need, anyway? They are still the single most boring band I have ever seen live. And I first saw them in 1977 on the Hotel California tour. The two stars are for Joe Walsh (rocks!) and for the sound."
1,eagles67,"From what I have seen on A & E, this band misses Don Felder, I have never seen the Eagles perform this poorly, in my life, I love the eagles & never knew how much Felder inspired for this band!!! I suggest the band just retire, or go their separate ways, this performance is no way near Hell freezes over!!!"
5,Eagles Farewell 1 Tour DVD is great!,"I watched it on TV, which triggered me to remember how many of their songs I knew and loved, and I knew I wanted a keepsake for myself. A friend was visiting, mentioned how her son loves the Eagles, we watched the one I had ordered, and she had me order the second one through your website, for her (& maybe her son will get it eventually.) It's great music, fun to watch as they are very entertaining. Anything I have ordered through Amazon.Com, I have been happy with."
3,Love the Eagles But There's Someone Missing,Ok The concert is good ! Everyone is in good voice and they play all the favorites but those beautiful guitar melodies are missing! No Don Felder! Some other guitarist fills in with a half hearted attempt..... Ooooo Tequila Sunrise doesn't dance the way it should... You know that beautiful Spanish Guitar solo? Missing ! So if that wonderful melody line is a favorite of yours buy Hell Freezes Over..... There they are complete !!
3,I ordered the DVD and was sent HD DVD,I specifically ordered 2 of the Eagles: Farewell 1 Tour and instead received the HD DVD. They were Christmas presents for people who do not have HD DVD equipment. I would not have been able to return them and get my order back in time for Christmas. I wish order pullers would pay attention to the orders
3,"Okay, but....","It's okay, but that's all. For most of us REAL Eagles fans from back in the day, it's nothing spectacular. The teeny boppers on the front row rudely standing in front of the older seated fans couldn't have POSSIBLY remembered anything from the 70's (kind of reminds me of a Heart concert I went to in '87...but I digress).I saw the Eagles in Louisville on their North American Tour in 2002 and thought then what I thought now...I miss Don Felder. Steuart Smith tries, but he will NEVER be an Eagle-especially playing weak and looking like Lyle Lovett!But all in all, it sounded okay, although not as good as their 2002 tour. And like someone else said...LOSE THE HORNS & FIDDLE!"
3,watch the Eagles turn into the Beach Boys,"Didn't these guys used to play their own instruments? If it wasn't for all the backup musicians what would these guys do?, use prerecorded backing tracks? It used to be if the backing musicians outnumbered the actual band then you suffered the fate of the Monkees and were ridiculed for being a make-believe rock band. Nowadays the Eagles could care less about playing guitars. My guess is that their best musician, Don Felder got booted out for demanding that they give up their nostalgia act and get back to making and playing new songs. Simply put, this show is 90% slow vocal harmonies and 10% rock. If thats your idea of a good show then be my guest."
3,Good but not great,"I have just received by post the Eagles DVD. I must say I am a bit dissappointed with some of the songs although the sound and picture is great.The Eagles should forgo songs from their not-so-sucessful solo careers.I find the songs by Joe Walsh tedious and boring.Only when the James Gang is reunited miracalously, only then I prefer him peforming Funk#49/Rocky Mountain Way.Where are the great Eagles songs like Best Of My Love, Witchy Woman, James Dean, Droolin' Dalton etc ?????As for the new guitarist Steurt Smith he is competent (Hotel California is below par) but I miss the underated original guitarist Don Felder.To see how great Don is, have a look at the When Hell Freeze Over DVD.The Eagles ""Live"" 1980 cd is a much better presentation of the band.The fans came to hear the Eagles not songs fron Don, Glen & Joe.Best regards.Abu BakarKuala Lumpur, Malaysia."
2,EAGLES?,"Don Felder not missed? Seriously, have you no clue who the Eagles really were? Without Don Felder, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner there is no Eagles, just musicians trying to copy their greatness."
5,The Eagles,excellent sound and a great show. I have been watching it over and over. I purcessed 2 DVD to give as a farewell present to one of my friends.
4,Highly recommend it!,The concert HD video AND the sound is absolutely AWESOME! Each and every track is the Eagles at their best.
3,No CD available??,"I loved the concert on NBC and truly enjoyed it.But not being able to get the concert on CD is really unfortunate. Joe Walsh's new song was the highlight of the entire show. I grew up during their 70's tours and went to several of them. I would have loved to have seen them once more live. I'm sorry to the guy who said ""Goodbye Forever"" Eagles.The reason the Eagles have remained so popular is obvious.The write and play GREAT music..Sorry you don't agree."
4,What a thrill!,"What a thrill to see the Eagles Farewell 1 tour in Australia. The special that they showed on NBC a couple of years ago did not include them doing Tequila Sunrise, but of course it is on the DVD and wonderful! The only thing I missed was the commentary between songs."
4,Love the Eagles,"My husband and I enjoyed listening and watching this DVD. Great music! The only problem that we noticed is that the volume of the ""vocals"" were dimmed by the volume of the instrumental music. It's like the mikes weren't working well or something. Don't know if it's a problem with the DVD taping or our sound system."
5,Great DVD,I have had this DVD for over a year and have watched it many many times. I purchased two more for Xmas gifts.
1,BUYER BEWARE: Not worth purchasing if you don't have DTS,"I'm not throwing any rocks and stones at the band. Their performance is top notch and the song selection is a true representation of their best. Perhaps Witchy Woman should have formed part of the set but only they know why it was not included.My main gripe about this purchase is that we are not offered a Dolby 5.1 surround sound track. The fine folks at Warner Music Vision & ERC have decided that if you do not possess a DTS system, you will be punished by being forced to listen to the DVD in 'glorious' PCM (2-channel speaker) stereo.Is there a legit reason why there is no Dolby 5.1 surround sound track?This is a true sign of disrespect towards not only the fans of The Eagles but to all consumers.Review by Brian Grindrod"
1,returned this item,I returned this item because I did not realize that the HD DVD format would not play on my blueray player. I noticed later when I reordered that this item was no longer available and carried a big warning message. I have since reordered the regular DVD vesion and am happy with it. I hope I got credit for my return!
2,Concert at Arwohwad Pond Better than Melbourne DVD,JUSt saw the concert last night..Eagles live sounded better. The MElbourne DVD was a disaapointment. THe ney guy who relaced Dnn Felder is not as good... Joe and Don had chemistry when they jammed.. This new guy. Stuart SMith...its not the same.. Henley is gaining weight.. Hell FReezes over is a claasicand they sound much better albeit they were 10 years younger. By that one instead of this...and I am a great Eagles fan....Miss Don Felders guitar playing especially in Hotel California when he and joe got into it in HEll Freezes over.......Anybody knows if he is ever going to be allowed to rejoin them?
1,Buyer Beware,"This disc is an ""HD DVD"" which to my surprise is a ""bastard format"" that plays on very few players. Don't make the same mistake I did instead order the DVD format. This really should be mentioned in the ad."
1,This DVD does not work. I have tried it in several different DVD players and my computer. How do I return?,Doesn't work! How do I return? Please send me step by step instructions. Thank you. Sincerely Nick Causey Come back to me as soon as possible.
1,disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this product because it could not be played in Australia. Have returned for credit, which I am still waiting for. I could not rate it zero stars. I haven't heard it yet."
1,Defective Dud- twice,"Disappointing. Beware-- ""Farewell Tour"" hd dvd ordered from Amazon was defective. Would not load. Returned for replacement and the second one did the same thing. Credit/return was easy, though. Bought the regular DVD locally-- and it is AWESOME as we knew it would be."
1,eagles farewell 1 tour from melbourne,i returned it bec it dont have closed caption in it which it said it does when i ordered it i. i am disppointed with it
5,excellent concert DVD,"Great DVD...studio quality sound and great video presentation, not jumping around every two seconds like some concert DVD productions do. Will make the casual listener to Eagles music a fan of them. Best vocal harmonies in the business. Very dynamic band: Henley, Frey, Schmitt, and Walsh each have unique and diverse talents. This DVD is worth purchasing, it will stay on top of your DVD stack in your entertainment room."
3,No Hell Freezes Over Concert,"This is the only Eagles Concert on any HD format at the moment, They choose the wrong concert tho it should have been the The Hell Freezes Over Concert that would have sounded amazing with DTS-HD Master Audio, I remember in the day when DVD first came out this was the go to reference to show off DVD's amazing picture and sound quality I personally think this would have been very befitting for the new high resolution format but alias they choose the Farewell 1 Tour never mind this is still a great concert and will not disappoint I still recommend"
5,3 hours of great entertainment,I have always loved the Eagles and this is a great video that truely displays a very talented group. Worth every penney as I have played it more than once already and will view it many times more. It never gets old!
5,Absolutely spectacular beyond words.,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN of the Amazon community this Eagles dvd music video represents the ultimate in audiophile and videophile execllence.Iam not going comment on the genious of this band..everything has been said that can be said possitively.JUST GET IT.
5,Wonderful Memories,"Nice to see the group ""back"" again & in unison with one another. No ""bruised"" egos shown here as there was in the ""Hell Freezes Over"" MTV Concert. Pure enjoyment from favorite oldies as well as new melodies. I think this generation got it right !"
5,EAGLES DVD,This dvd is fabulous! It is the greatest. I enjoyed this because I am a huge Eagles fan. I am so glad they produced the dvd for all to enjoy! I would highly recommend this to all that love the eagles! I have played it several times and enjoy it every time.
1,Goodbye....forever!,The Eagles is one of the biggest selling artist in the U.S.A. in the middle of 70s. Still I wonder what good is that band. I have nothing good to say. I really hate songs like Hotel California and A New Kid In the Town. Himo Pohonen likes this band!
3,"Bah, get something else!","I had the standard battery that came with the Nokia's 5185, that would barely last 36 hours while being on during that entire time. I got the 1500mAh Lithium-Ion so it would last longer than the 36 hours of always being on. It seems as though it doesn't want to last but 40-44 hours of always on and that is without zero usuage of phone calls/recieve, just on and sitting idle. But now if you turn it off for times that you know it won't be used at all then the time goes to 3 or 4 days before recharge. I'll be keeping it for that reason, but if I test the orginial one and last that long before a recharge then this thing blows......"
5,Fixed my Wife's Old Phone...,My wife uses er old phone as an alarm clock and the original battery finally lost it's life... This battery revived her phone and should allow her to use the phone for years to come...
4,Impeller part,Impeller part was just what we needed for the pump. The old one was missing and this one worked just fine.
4,Works great with cleaning of chamber,This product replaces the original without any modification. However I found that even with a new replacement impeller you MUST clean the chamber completely to aide in proper operation. I would recommend this part without hesitation.
4,Good-But Not much of anything New,"When I saw that this DVD was coming out I had to have it. Even though this DVD gives the facts there is really nothing new that we don't already know, or anything new that we didn't already read in Say you Love Satan! One of the good things is that you get to see Jimmy Troiano. Jimmy is interviewed throughtout the whole DVD. Also the Bonus scenes has an interview with Jimmy as well. Another cool thing with the Bonus Scenes are:Ricky and Jimmy's statements to the PoliceGary's Autospy report.In all I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is intersted in this story"
3,OK DVD,"Product wasn't what I expected. Follows one account of a group of teenage youths who dabble in drugs, alcohol, murder and satanic activities."
4,Inspiration+creativity=genius...or is it madness?,"I know it's not an exact match for Optimus Prime in the Transformers movies, but I was able to create my own version with this model kit."
5,The 1954 Disney classic in spectacular 2 DVD Set!!!,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is an all time Disney live action classic!!! This awesome 2 DVD set has a THX approved anamorphic widescreen transfer of the film and ""submarine"" full of great supplimental material!!! This 1954 classic is fun for the entire family!!! Now's it avalibale at nice low price!!! I'm pretty sure a Blu Ray version will ""surface"" eventually,until that we have this great version to enjoy!!!"
3,It's ok I guess.,"It's interesting and all. However, it's almost nothing like the book. Just like when Nemo sets foot on the prison island. the Captain Nemo from the book would have never sent foot on human inhabited land. And also in the book only small details of his past personal life were reviled until the end of the book. I under stand that they had to cut and rearrange certain parts for the sake of time. But still they didn't have to change the story this much."
2,Replacement for Bad DVD,"Thia was a birthday gift to my grand-son, he loves this type of movie and was taken by 2000 leagues when he saw it on tv so of course he wanted the movie. There was a problem with the playing of the movie so they are trying to get a replacement dvd and have not heard if they were successful in getting a replacement. So will re-review when it is resolved."
3,Very enjoyable movie,"Great movie for its time, especially with the Nautilus. Special effects were good for the time. James Mason did a good job. Kirk Douglas was well cast as Ned Land."
4,A Classic,"This is a classic movie! I enjoy watching movies from this time period before they had quite worked all the kinks out of ""special effects"". If you enjoy movies from this era, or are just looking for a clean film to watch, this is a pretty decent film."
5,Bought for my husband; he really likes it,"There are a bunch of special features on here, and he says they're great. I haven't watched more than just the main feature myself, but it seems to be a good print of it."
3,20ooo leagues under the sea,"I recomend this movie to someone who like ,to have some imagination anflike the maritime live like de author of that movie"
3,Disney Movie,"This is not one of my favorite Disney movies. Kirt Dougles protrays a rowdy, at times hard drinking sailor which is definately not an example I would like my sons to follow. This movie is more an older teen/ adult type movie."
5,"I've watched it 20,000 times and still love it!","Walt Disney's magnificent debut into live-action films was the unforfeitable 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. This is one of my favorite Disney films. The story, actors, sets, and special effects are unbelievable! I loved watching this film growing up. I love it even more now! This is fun family film!"
4,One of the best Jules Verne movie,"I bought this movie for my son (6 years), but we enjoyed so much as new action movie."
2,"poor streaming quality,not HD as charged","Amazon video shown as HD, but was actually quite poor quality. Barely SD quality, not a good product , should not be labeled as HD"
4,Great Family Movie,"I saw this when I was a child. It was fun to share it with my young boys after so many years. They loved it. Kirk Douglas was a ""hoot""!"
2,Disappointed,"Didn't understand that we were ordering a product which could only be viewed on an European DVD player - returned, asked for one that could be viewed in the U.S. but received a refund instead."
1,"20,000 Leaques Under The Sea","I purchased the 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea disc as I am collecting James Mason films. I have been unable to play this dvd on my Sony dvd player. I emailed TCM and told them the problem but have never heard from them about this problem. I have purchased other discs from TCM and have never had a problem. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this dvd. I rated it ""I hated it"" only because I can't enjoy seeing it."
2,Moral Muddle,"The ship (the Nautilus) goes deep, but almost everything else about this science fiction movie is superficial. So why is it entertaining? Is it a tease, is it the fascination with past/future imaginings, the visual experience (an early version of a nuclear submarine, recognizable actors, historically accurate sets), or music designed for greatest impact? Learn from this film's mistakes, then teach your children higher standards."
1,You guys suck!,I ordered this DVD a full month before Christmas. I still don't have it. Can you reimburse me?
3,"Does the job, but not forever","It adds a bit of weight and it could vibrate with a bit more ""oomph"", as mentioned by other reviewers. But it does get the job done. My one concern is that I've had this battery for about two years, and it no longer seems to hold a charge for very long. I drain it and discharge it frequently, but I still can't seem to get it to last more than a day or two, even with light usage.Am I asking too much of a NiMH battery to expect it to work like new for more than a couple of years? Well, I'll probably just buy another one. But consider yourself warned: it doesn't last forever."
1,Always low or dead,"The Nokia 900 mAh NiMN Extended Vibrating Battery is anything but extended unless you are counting the time you will have it in a charger trying to keep it charged. I have had mine 41 days and am already having trouble keeping it charged. My phone is on about 10 hours per day with minimal talk time, Usually less than 30 mins. per day."
5,Perfect for So Many Things,"Of my flower punches, this one is my favorite. The flower is bold and sturdy. You can use a patterned paper (like scrapbooking paper) and the pattern shows because there's enough ""bulk"" to the piece. It's a great addition to cards and other crafts because the petals don't bend out. The punch itself is great, heavy and comfortable to use. Every crafter needs this blossom!"
4,the 10th kingdom,"When I received this movie, I had to open it right away because there were disks that were rattling around, thank goodness I was not damaged."
5,The 10th Kingdom ... * * * * *,They usually present this serie around Christmas. This year they didn't so I had to bought it to see it once more !
1,10 Mediocre Kingdoms,"I gave it one star because far to many people gave it 4 or 5 so I bought it. It has a good idea for the story based on kingdoms of fairy tales. However, I don't like it when people hype a movie that is mediocre. The movie is okay, nothing more. The characters are decent, nothing more. The story is alright, nothing more. The music is passable, nothing more. In other words this movie is mediocre and slow. I tried to sit through this but it just takes to long to do what it does. This could have been a much shorter movie and it would have been better. It is obvious they tried to stretch this out to be televised over a week as a mini-series. I suggest you rent this first. It may put you to sleep and regretting you listened to one of the reviews praising it. Although a decent family movie, it should be watched over 2 or 3 sittings to keep boredom from setting in. I will not sit through it again so I am donating my copy to a charity."
1,"Fantasy this bad, can only suck the the life from you","I couldn't even get through this. It has some name actors which made me mistakenly think it would be decent. Very tedious, boring, and just plain BAD."
1,waste of time,in my perspective this movie was a complete waste of my time and a complete waste of money for the producers. I wouldnt reccomend this at all. Save yourself and dont buy it...ever.
4,Fairy Tale Film,The use of fairy tales in this film is absolutely ingenious. The way in which different fairy tales are interspersed in the plot is what makes this such a great movie. I espcially loved the way certain fairy tale characters who generally get a bad name are turned into good characters in this movie.
4,Wonderous,"The 10th Kingdom is full of wonderful graphics, imagination, and action. It brings fairy tales to life and not all are happilly ever after... I recommend anyone who is a child at heart to see it."
5,Great Fantasy... It takes you away...,"10th Kingdom is one of my favorites. I bought it on VHS and then purchased the DVD when it became available. It is simply amazing.It is a complex tale of a young girl's abandonment by her mother and the consequences it has on her future relationships. It is filled with humor, tragedy, great characters and it pulls you right in. You feel as if you have stepped through the magic mirror and are experiencing the story first-hand.Be prepared to spend some quality time with your TV. It's about 7 hours long... but oh, so worth it. Take the time... and enjoy!"
2,The Tenth Kingdom,I was very disappointed in the condition of the case. It seems like the insert was to long for the case which then made the plastic on the case wrinkle and look horrible. I orded this new so thaat it would be in great condition and now I have this movie that looks used and abused. I wish that picture shown by amazon portrayed the condition that was actually what they were sending. Very disappointed. What's the point of ordering new movies and paying full price if I can get used movies in better condition for cheaper?
5,10th Kingdom---- Great Movie!!!,"This is a great movie, I bought one as a birthday present and they were Thrilled!!!! It is a hard to find movie so they couldn't believe it when I gave it to them !!!1"
5,Addictive Movie,"This is a very addicting movie! You just can't stop watching. My Aunt had this movie when we went to visit her and we promptly came home and ordered it, my Aunt then watched with me and I had to order it for her too, and she is a teacher. She brought this to class for thier ""free Friday's"" and now her class has seen it several times. This is a light hearted fantasy type movie. I reccomend it for all ages!"
5,I WISH I CAN GIVE THIS MOVIE 10 STARS IF WERE ALOUD TO,I'M NOT GOING TO TELL THE TALE BUT SAY IF SOMEONE SAYS THIS MOVIE SEEMS DUMB AND HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET I'LL SAY WATCH IT AND SAY THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. I'LL SAY I TOLD U SOOOO.............
5,Movie was great - but HELP is DVD full version?,Best Movie Ever!I have already seen the VHS versions - the one tape version and then the 2 tape set. They do not compair at all to the full TV version - there were to many scenes cut out of my beloved movie.Ive noticed the DVD is longer. I could not find in anybodys reviews if they found the DVD to be the true Full Telivision Version. Some one who knows the full TV version(practally by heart)PLEASE let me know. Please email me zaahzu@yahoo.com
2,What a disappointment...,"I'd read the book The 10th Kingdom a long time ago and just loved it. It was a great fantasy book -- one that I'd recommend for anyone into this type of genre.I bought this DVD set about a week ago, thinking it too would become a favorite of mine (based on all the good reviews here on Amazon as well as a stellar review from a friend of mine). I have to say, though, that I was supremely disappointed by the quality of this film! Most of the acting was embarrassingly bad and the script wasn't that good, either. (The costumes and the sets, though, weren't bad--nor were the effects.) It's too bad, 'cause I think that this DVD series really could have been something fantastic.... ah well."
3,tenth kingdom review,I was dissappointed when i go the dvd the disc was loose in the case and the disc was scracthed up a bit
5,Incredible miniseries,This is an incredible originally-on-television miniseries. Fun and very well done - great writing!!
5,The Best Movie of all time,"This movie is the best movie of all time. I am a fan 100% and I think it's great. The person I think played the best role is Dianne Weist. She played the greatest role as Queen. This movie is a very good movie because it envolves fairy tales and Magic Mirrors and those really attract me in this movie. I love it and I have the soundtrack, 1 tape movie and the book and 1 million pictures. Another movie I have to recomend is Alice In Wonderland(the people version with Whoppi Goldberg). That is cool but this movie is the best you could ever own and I would rate it 1 million stars."
5,A Great Movie For The Whole Family!,"This is a movie I would see a thousand times.It was great I was so happy each night to be taken to a world away from Earth.To experience total wonderfulness!It is an amazing trip that takes you for a loop,and a spin through a world of real life fairy tales. I recommend this DvD or VHS Highly I Would Have Rated it more than five stars but that was the highest! Please watch this movie and enjoy. --Collin"
5,Very Enjoyable and Fun to watch,"*Note** Actually only a 7 hour movie.**This movie is great for DVD, because you can pause it any time and come right back to the spot where you left off. I had never heard of the ""10th Kingdom"", I saw the movie in the store,I read the summary and thought I would give it a try. WOW, what a great story! I am glad I bought it. It is 200 years after the ""Happily ever After..."" part in the fairy tales we grew up hearing about.The actor Scott Cohen plays the chcaracter ""Wolf"", a very energetic and entertaining character to watch, and easily my favorite. I am now buying it for my Mom, one who loves fantsy and fairy tales."
5,Who IS afraid of Virgina (Wolff)?,"This enjoyable six and a half hour movie was amazing. One of the most enjoyable characters was Wolf (this actor, whose name is evading me, has recently been seen on the WB's Gilmore Girls as Max Medina). Wolf's entire attitude and intentions bring constant amusement and plays well off the other actors roles. I also enjoyed the trolls. They are constantly tripping on trouble and their comment, ""Suck an elf"", cracks me up every time.The story line combines many well known and some not so well known fairy tales into the tremendous adventure of Virginia and her father. The ingenuity of the writer to bring all these terrific stories together is inspiring and heart warming. It is wonderful to see a new take on old tales."
3,Fairytale land takes a hit,"This is a long children's fantasy movie with at time very uneven acting.I think the witch mother-in-law may be the best acxtted part.I really enjoyed the movie, but it seemed caught between a cartoonand a Disney fairytale reenactment? The trolls are like none I've seen or heard of before. It has an alternate universe type plot with a mirror gatewaylike the classic Alice in Through the Looking Glass.I suppose the wolf can have his tail surgically removed in New York, ha, ha..."
3,DVD quality,It was delivered in a reasonable amount of time but when I played the disc there was a small red rectangle at the bottom right of the playing screen that remains there for about 10 minutes out of the entire playing of the movie. It's kind of annoying.It's a wonderful movie however and it's totally worth seeing!
4,I adore this movie!,"A person of any age could enjoy this movie, however long it happens to be - 10 hours. For example, I saw it first at age 15 and now five years later, I watch it at any opportunity I have. I used to watch it, taped off tv, while getting ready to go to high school, and now I watch it between classes in college. It's a fantastic adventure that draws all of the stories one learned as a child together and creates an elaborate adult fantasy fairy tale. Word to the wise: DO NOT attempt to watch this movie in one sitting, it will overwhelm!"
5,Super Super Super,"Excellent TV show, I loved every minute of it; it was funny, romantic, it had everything. In my opinion is one of the best shows yet."
5,wonderful,"this is a wondeful movie great sets great actors . intreging story, i defintly recomend this to anyone who likes a classic fairy tails. this one is a little strange with a mesh of everything put together still very good."
5,"""Huff Puff! Another great movie!""","This was a great movie. The casting was wonderful, the book was well written, and the music added to the movie alot. Mr.Cohen did a wonderful job as Wolf, Mrs.Williams was great also. How did the director come up with such a good cast? And the little extra chars added alot of touch to the story, it made it just perfect. The connection between the Queen and Virginia was also added to the wonderful plot. If you have never seen this movie my fictonal char Fox has only one thing to say, ""Get it now! Oh and...Virginia move over Wolf is mine! *shoves Virginia away and grabs Wolf* Mine!""So as you can see you'll love the book and all the action, terror, drama, and all the other great elements of the story and movie. Aaron (friends char):*takes out his gun and grabs Fox* I thought you liked me! Fox: I was joking! *kisses Aaron*"
5,The 10th Kingdom,I love this movie! It was origonaly a mini series I think on NBC(Not sure) It gets a bit long feeling as it IS a three CD DVD but I love every minute of it!
1,Water-Damage to DVD,I was given the 10th Kingdom DVD as a X-mas present. And was unhappy when I opened the package from Amazon that DVD cover had water/excessive sundamage to it and the discs were loose.
2,The 10th Kingdom,Product was received in poor shape and reported to Amazon. Was quickly taken care of.Company Congobooks sent e-mail of apology and responded quite satisfactorily. Will use again barring any further product problems.
2,Idiotic,"As I read others' reviews, I was thinking ""Did I watch the same movie?"" At that instant, I saw a reviewer who asked the same question.I'm surprised this movie is getting so many good reviews. I thought it was moronic. Most of the characters are incompetant idiots who are overdrawn and overacted. They were the type of characters I would expect to find in a movie for 5-to-7-year-olds. However, there is so much sexual innuendo in this movie that it can't possibly be meant for that age range. Essentially, it was a bunch of silly, irritating characters trying to express adult themes. It just didn't work.To be fair, maybe it got better further in, but I doubt it. I don't think I made it past the first DVD. I donated the whole set to a rummage sale. What a waste of money."
3,Needed to be shorter,"The 10th Kingdom had great production values and a good cast. But, the story was too weak to be so long. It would have been better as a 2 or 3 parter instead of 5."
1,Marathon Length sans plot,"I had a review up on this movie for a couple weeks that kept getting ""not helpful"" reviews, so I'm trying again...how can I nicely say that this movie is REALLY BAD. I'm not a movie snob, I swear...and I love cheesy fantasy, the more glitter and fairies the better. I think this one would be good for small children, but if you're an adult looking for a fantasy movie, try The Snow Queen, Merlin, The Princess Bride, Legend, anything but this!!"
4,Very Good Fantasy Miniseries,"This is a wonderful Miniseries with a above average plot. The story takes place in 9 different kingdoms and the settings are wonderful and beautifully constructed. At first, the characters in this story seem shallow and unbelievable because they were written as such. Later, we find that the characters have more depth than whats on the surface. Unfortunatley, this doesn't happen until 300 minutes into this 450 minute film. Still, it is a very good story overall, especially if you have an imagination."
5,Entertaining and amusing,The fairy tale mixed with reality is always a hit if done right. The hair in the Rapunzel part was awesome.
4,Great Ensemble cast,I remember watching this show years ago on TV and was glad to get it on DVD. Fun take on fairy tales.
3,Okay,"If your interested in the whole fairytale stuff such as Snow White, Red Riding Hood, and stuff like that then you would prefer this. If your not a fan, then don't buy it. It's a great mini-series in all but nothing to worship. A person that likes the mini-series 'Alice' and 'Tin Man' would like this DVD. Entertaining and a great family movie but if your looking for action then don't worry about it. I seen it when it came on NBC and watched it numerous times over the years and never grew tired of it."
4,Wonderful Fantasy,"The 10th Kingdom is great for fantasy suckers like me. It has some really fun parts and an interesting premise. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because there are a couple parts where it drags on a little. Come on though... for an 8 hour film, it does a pretty decent job of holding your attention!"
5,An Amazing Miniseries,"You would think that a 7 - 1/2 movie is not your cup of tea. If you have any appreciation of fairy tales, then this movie is your cup of tea. The beauty of the film is it answering the question, ""What happens after happily ever after?"" The acting in the film was top rate (two standout performances are Dianne Wiest (the Queen) and Scott Cohen (Wolf)). It was also quite humorous with such jokes as one of the Grimm Brothers being locked in the same cell as the main characters (200 years prior of course), and the hysterical antics of Wolf. While children can relate to this film, it is really an adult film with its violence and adult themes. I highly recommend it for anyone (the DVD version especially) who enjoys beatiful scenery, fantastic acting, and a great, exciting story. I would recommend againist trying to watch it all in one day though!"
5,A Wonderful Adventure,"I started watching this mini-series with very little expectation. Boy was I ever wrong! This is funny, witty, and charming, very much like the fairy tales. There were a few disturbing scenes of violence (which makes this PG-13), but well worth having in the family library. The cinematography was just breathtaking. This is good viewing pleasure."
5,This Movie Rocks!!!!!!,The 10th kingdom is a very very very good movie!!! It has lots of adventure in it and it is a very good fairy tale.Every part was exciting and some parts were really really surprising.This movie was the very best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,10th Kingdom,Love this dvd. I loved it when it was on the tv couple years back. they should have more family friendly fairy tale like films.
5,Fairy Tale Fantasy for Big Kids,"This is one of my favorite movies (miniseries, whatever!). I could totally watch it beginning to end in one day and want to watch it again immediately! Great fun for kids but even better for grownups (there are definitely some things that will go right over younger kids heads).Lots of big names in this movie and some wonderful acting, especially my favorite character WOLF!! I can't recommended this DVD highly enough. Buy it and you won't regret it :)"
5,The most under rated mini series ever - thank goodness for DVD,"Everything about this series is perfection. The story, the actors, the sets. It's a joy. I don't know why it was such a bust when it aired on TV.It's a good old fashioned fairy tale about a young lady from New York who jumps through a mirror and enters an enchanted land filled with beautiful princesses, ugly trolls, evil sorceresses, comical interludes and loving friends.It's not even corny - I really, really liked it. Fun for all ages...bg"
5,AWESOME MOVIE,"This movie is amazing. You think you know what's going to happen and what is going on. You think you know who's who. Everything always changes in a big twist. One is Virginia is really attracted to Wolf but then something happens and she hates him. Amazing characters, story, and score. The opening theme,""I'm Wishing"" was an amazing piece of music. The trolls were the funniest characters. ""There are nine kingdoms. What shall we call this one?"". About one minuete later. ""The 10th Kingdom!"". It was such a good movie, they should make a sequel! And I'm usually a tough critic!"
5,Love it,"I really enjoyed this seires, I really think anyone who likes modern fanatasy should watch it."
5,FANTASY FANTASTIC!,This movie takes you to a world not far from our own. It keeps you wondering what's going to happen next and to whom? When my family watched it together on television we knew that we had to have it. It's extremely funny in parts and made us feel sad in others. With Virginia and Wolf at the end there must be a sequel to come. Enjoy. This is a very entertaining movie. If you were born in the 60's you'll love it even more.
4,This goes beyond words.,"If you could bottle up all of your imagination and record it on film, you'd end up with ""The 10th Kingdom."" I am not usually one for long epics (I tend to lose interest) yet this video had me glued to my seat for the whole thing. (Okay, there were one or two minor draggy parts, but they were surprisingly few and far between.) It has everything... fantasy, action, romance, humour, twists and quirks galore. I LOVED IT! It totally kept me on my toes, and just when I thought I had things figured out, something would catch me completely off-guard.The cast is phenominal (especially the lovable and irrepressible ""Wolf""), the special effects are jaw-dropping, and the wit is admirable. I don't think I would recommend it to viewers that are too young, though, as there are some mature themes in it and some scenes that may be scary, depending on the child. It is definitely the kind of movie that you can watch with people who have a wide variety of tastes in movies."
1,The 10th Kingdom,"Poor quality DVD. I have ordered it twice and both copies have skips and deleted sections. The DVD was packaged well and shipped promptly. The shipper was more than willing to correct the problems, and they were not even his fault."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I ENJOY JOHN LARROQUETTE AS A PERFORMER BUT FOUND HIS CONTRIBUTION TO THIS MADE FOR T.V. SERIES EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. IT WAS CRUDE IN BOTH THE STORY LINE AND SCRIPT. FAIRY TALES HAVE A MYSTERY ABOUT THEM WHICH COUNTERBALENCES THE CRUELTY. THE CREATORS OF THIS SERIES,COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTANDING THE POINT OF FAIRY TALES, TAKE THE WORST ASPECTS OF THE STORIES AND USE THEM FOR CHEAP EFFECT,WHICH IS HEIGHTENED BY THE VERY UNSUBTLE PERFOMANCES BY MOST OF THE ACTORS. NOT WORTH THE WATCHING TIME OR THE COST."
2,Clever but slow,"The movie, though cleverly plotted, lacked percision when it came to makeup and setting. The characters of fairy tale legends looked more dolled up ""trolls"". It was also far to long, and no matter how great a movie may be, not many people can sit through something over two hours. The acting ranged from excellent to poor, with an exceptional prefromance from ""the evil stepmother"". But the slow pace makes even the most avid of movie go-ers feel confined and bored. It's a good movie for a Saturday night but not the best for rapid-preview."
2,Shudder,"I didn't see the whole thing, but I disliked what I saw. It was pure idiocy. It looked amazingly fake, the acting was not exactly stellar, and it was tedious. Honestly, when will a mini-series turn out decent?"
1,Wretched Tripe,"I love fairy tales. When I first heard the concept of this movie, I was very excited and borrowed my sister-in-laws copy. Ugh. It is horrible! If you just want to watch slapstick comedy mixed with weird sexual innuendos, anachronisms and bad acting, then by all means watch this movie. If, however, you prefer your fairy tales with a bit of intelligence, stay far, far away from The 10th Kingdom. If it were possible to rate something less than 1 star, I would.All I can say is ""We will, we will shear you""."
5,Something different in a world of copycats.,"What I can't believe is how intricate this whole story is. I really shows a lot of different story lines, characters and twists and turns along the way. It is inventive and enjoyable. I have watched bits and pieces since the first time I watched the entire thing at once. Everytime I watch, I see something I didn't see before.Scott Cohen as ""Wolf"" is totally amazing. He is the perfect lead male in a twisted fairytale. He is charming, sexy, daring, and yet flawed in a number of ways. John Larroquette is great as ""Tony"" and he has the comic timing down pat. Kimberly Williams holds it all together while being brave and vulnerable all at once.My kids are 10 & 7 and they love it. My Mom is in her 60's and she loves it so it appeals to many age groups.If you can't handle fantasy, don't watch. If you are sick of the same old formulas, then give it a try for something new."
4,This was different from the original airing,"When this miniseries first came out, I was hooked. LOVED the Wolf. When it came to DVD, I noticed there were scenes missing that could have easily been included on the DVD. But, it is still very imaginative and enjoyable."
3,T10K incomplete,"I loved T10K when it originally aired- the intertwining story lines, the self-referential humor, and the well-played characters all mingled to produce an extraordinary production.I watched T10K again when it ran on NBC last week (Aug 2000) and was disturbed to see that they had edited it judiciously! So I obtained the video copy and was _again_ disturbed to see that it, too, was edited! But each one was edited in a different manner! For example: Parts about the Queen were left out of the second TV version, but were left in the VHS, while one of my favorite scenes (the Mushrooms trying to convince Tony to put them in the omelette) was left out of the VHS version!I guess the only way to see the complete saga is to have taped it when it first ran, or to obtain it through NBC itself.I can't _highly_ recommend this video, but it is as good as you can get for the time being."
5,Just as promised-10th kingdom,"I must admit I was very hesitant when ordering the 10th kingdom as a used product. I did not know what to expect. However, when I received the item it was just as the seller had promised. The discs were in excellent condition, not a single scratch on them. I am very happy with this product and I would definitely buy from this seller again."
4,Good show even for the kids.,"I really enjoyed this mini-series. It had a good amount of humor, a lot of imagination and creativity. My kids really loved this movie because the story line also correlates with Snow White, Cinderella, Rapunzel, and most fairy tales that we as children generally grew up hearing. I only gave it four stars because I did feel that it was a little hoaky at the beginning. But once you start to watch it, you really do get sucked in. My family and I found this show to be a great source of entertainment, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy."
3,"Good, but not Great","This movie was quite good. Splendid acting from all of the title characters. It kept me interested and rooting for the ""good side"". However, there was a certain amount of stupidity in it that I could have personally done without. The big losing streak for me were the three troll siblings who displayed the worst acting that I've seen since Jeremy Irons was in Dungeons and Dragons (if you haven't seen it...don't!). Without the impossibly lame acting of the trolls this movie would have deserved five stars in my opinion, but I often found myself wincing when they commentend with such things as ""Nicey Nice"", or danced along to Saturday Night Fever. However, whether this movie was a masterpiece or not is obviously for you to decide. I tried it, and found myself distinctly craving more."
2,"When it is good, it is very, very good; but when it is bad it is rotten","There is plenty of cleverness in this mini-series, both in setting and in characters. Furthermore most of the actors are very good (except for those who are... well... not). In better hands this could have been a brilliant production. Some people clearly love this show, but to do that, you have to turn a blind eye to its failings. (Love is blind, though, is it not?) In good fiction, the plot feels like a natural extension of the characters choices. In this production, the characters are dragged from plot point to plot point like some absurd relay race. It strained my suspension of disbelief until it snapped. By the third act, I was literally throwing my hands in the air in frustration.I instead recommend ""The Enchanted Forest Chronicles"" novels by Patricia C. Wrede."
2,Too Long Unnecessarily,"Not very well done and boring to the extreme, overdone on the wolf character, definetly not a kids movie. Way too long and seemed to get stuck in the middle so to speak. Definetly would not recommend it to anyone. Most scenes could have been left out entirely, most were just crude; it just seemed to go on and on, needlessly . Just plain bad."
2,Sophomoric At Best.,"Two (2) Stars--and that's being generous--is the most I can give this film. Sorry to say that--for ME--it was a severe disappointment, too sophomoric in plot/script/execution/direction but with some--only some--interesting special effects. Yes, the CONCEPT is a good one, but it never comes to fruition in this film with flawed character development [too comic strip simplistic] and only the Evil Queen barely believable in her malice. If you MUST, rent it vs buying it for viewing or else you're wasting your money!"
2,Not really a fantasy,"I love fantasy and magic realism. However, this is not really a fantasy film. It's a frenetic series of adventures featuring a group of bumbling characters who somehow manage to do things right by accident once in a while. The humor is slapstick. The atmosphere is not magical. It's a predictable type of Hollywood film dressed up with a bunch of special effects, plus special side jokes for New Yorkers. And it's tiresomely, tediously long. I could barely get through it. OK, the special effects are sophisticated and expensive, but repeat, this is not really a fantasy."
2,What was Hallmark thinking?,This movie is so scattered and is unworthy of the Hallmark name which is the reason I bought it.
1,water damaged,The discs were loose when I recived the product anbd the cover was all wrinkled from water damage I would not buy ever again
2,A great idea wasted by a typical television approach.,"I bought the DVD set based on some of the customer reviews here, but I can't imagine what show they were watching.This could have fantastic, if only the premise had been put in the hands of someone with real imagination and the courage to try to do something different than standard american TV fare.As it is, we sat for long stretches between the bits of actual entertainment that peeked through now and then.What a waste."
4,Fun fantasy,"An enjoyable light-hearted fantasy loosely based on fairy tales and fairy tale characters. Stars the very attractive and sexy Kimberly Williams (the daughter from Father of the Bride), with John Larroquette as her father and Scott Cohen as Wolf, a man with a tail :-) With a few cameos including Ed O'Neill (Al Bundy from Married with Children) as the Troll King. Lots of pretty special effects. Would probably appeal to kids but has enough of a plot and enough humour for grown-ups too."
5,Spell Binding,"This 7 hour epic is wonderfully brought together with an excellent cast, enthralling characters, and breath taking scenery. It's about a 20-year-old waitress named Virginia (Kimberly Williams)who finds herself in another deminsion known as the 9 kingdoms with her father Tony (John Larquette) and a dog who used to be Prince Wendell(Daniel Lapaine). There they meet Wolf (Scott Cohen), a half/man and half/wolf, who helps them on their journey to save the 9 Kingdoms from the evil Queen (Diane Weist). This is a beautifully written and exciting movie. It's full of laughter, suspense, romance, and surprises. This movie is for anyone who wants something more then the ""same 'ol thing""."
5,"Cute, Intentionally Cheesy Family Movie","There are some things parents may object to, although younger children probably won't get some of the mild sexual innuendo (there's no nudity or anything like that), so if any sexual reference would be noticed, would be by adolescents or teens. Overall, a fun family film."
4,great but long,"This movie is really good. It has a mixture of some of Disney's classics, like Snow White and Cinderella. It is unusually long though. It is so long in fact, that it has to be on three different discs. It does have some parts that may be unsuitable for children, but that's the parents' decision. The 10th Kingdom is actually New York. Trolls found themselves there and have never seen it before, so they claimed it as the 10th Kingdom. Where they were orginally, there were nine kingdoms. Well, Virginia and her father end up in the magical world of the ninth kingdom, and the only way back to New York is though a specific mirror. While on their journey to find this mirror, they meet some strange beings, like a werewolf, an evil queen, a lying frog, and a singing ring. Watching it was an enjoyable experience."
5,A classic!,This is a family favorite in this house. A great movie to spend a rainy/snowy/sick day watching snuggled under a blanket. A not-just-for-kids romp through all of your favorite fairy tales.
4,Nicey Nice!,"Very funny, witty and mostly entertaining. Once you start waching, you want to watch all the discs straight through. The menu's ""intro"" of this miniseries is absolutely amazingly beautiful, watch it first. If there's anything negative about this film, it's that not all of the jokes work(-which is practically a law in these kinds of films). Some of the funny things end up being just silly and almost stupid. But there's only couple of those. All in all; this movie will move you as well as make you laugh.The cover and the intro might give you the idea that New York is being transformed into a fairytale land in this film. Fortunately this isn't the case, there's a good plot and most of the events take place in another kingdom- the 9th kingdom. And another thing you don't want to be fooled in: this is a fairytale for adults and teenagers, not for children."
5,A Fabulous Journey!,"This is a very nicely done miniseries. I saw it on the television, but on video it is even better! I love the characters Virginia, Wolf, Tony, and Prince Wendell because they each have their own personalities. Another great aspect of the movie is the way the plot twists and turns. When you think one thing will happen, the exact opposite occurs! The best part about it, though, is that this isn't one of your average fairy-tales. It is a modern-day, more adventurous fairy-tale packed with every emotion imaginable. In short, this is a movie that nobody can miss!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this watch looking for a ""classic"" time-piece go with suits and more formal dress. The band that comes with the watch is a strange clasp/hybrid that is hard to close. The band is also brown (and not black as it appears in the picture). The face is white and the hands are silver making it very hard to read in some light. Also the face is plastic and not crystal and scratched within a week or so.I would avoid this watch."
1,skipped all the way,The dvd arrived fast and in time but i could not watch it. It skipped all the way and there was no picture.All 3DVD exhibited same issue. Didn't bother to return.
1,Price,"Bought this at $20.95 on 28-Aug-2012 & the selling price today is $14.98, in less than a week!!!What has been done to keep the price competitive??Ridiculous!!!"
2,Boring,I purchased this for my third granddchild as I had gotten the original ones for my oldest one. These are rather boring compared to the originals.
2,Disappointed,I got this because a friend gave me the older ones. This doesn't give you the sounds of the alphabet as they're learning them. I was disappointed because there's a lot out there for learning their ABC's but not the phonics of them. That's what I wanted. All the cd's seem more entertainment based than educational now.
4,cool,item arrived in a timely manner. Thank you for your prompt service. I will shop from your store again. ...
1,Disappointed,"Received wrong item , not same as picture show , do not understand how they shipped like that , really disappointed when open the packet and see not the right one we been waiting for"
5,LeapFrog Videos are Wonderful!,I am a teacher and the mother of four children. These videos are wonderful! My two year old knows his alphabet and sounds from watching the Letter Factory. The three videos in this set are equally as wonderful! I would highly suggest these to anyone with young children!
3,Good learning tool,"Was recommended to me by many parents. My son loves to watch ""the Shark Show"" and sings along with them. The characters voices are a bit whiney and annoying to me especially after the 30th time of listening to it. Also wish it would start automatically instead of having to wait through 7 previews to start the movie for him. I think it is a good learning tool but there are so many more out there that I'm not going to get any more of this brand."
1,Biography - Krauthammer Charles.....,Informative but certainly NOT worth the amount it cost. I could have discovered all of the information in this article from other sources had I taken the time to do so.Very disappointing
2,This was an OK CD....,"Nothing can top (for me) the ""Superstition"" CD. This CD is OK, but (for me) doesn't have the magic that SATB's previous album did.Sad that this was SATB's final album together...."
4,The swan song of the Banshees,"I read last year on their official website that Siouxsie and the Banshees were finally calling it quits after 20 years. They cited the "" commercialization of punk "" as their main reason ( hear that, Blink-182 fans?). Being somewhat old school myself, I could only nod my head. This is perhaps their sweetest album. I say that in a positive way. It seems to be one of their most commercial albums also. Whether this was intended or not, only the artists know. At first I was taken aback by this one, being somewhat disappointed. The Banshees, however, often fail to resemble themselves on their previous albums. ""Rapture"" is perhaps their most pop offering to date, yet it was not a carbon copy of the pop music of the early nineties. Sioux gave up screaming for crooning years ago. My recommendation for new Banshees fans: buy this one and work backwards. Few artists are as versatile and indestructable as Siouxsie and the Banshees. Prick up your ears, they're touring again!"
1,bad quality - coating is damaged. bad assistance. no refund.,"Coating is damaged. After hardly a few uses coating is in your food!!I've send it to Presto, Then I've waited for about 6 month to get my replacement, and guess what? After a week replaced skillet coating is damaged too. And you pay your shipping and it costs more to send it back.It's junkie skillet. no use at all.dissapoited."
1,"Terrible, terrible product!!!","The ""nonstick"" coating starts peeling off in large chunks in the circle around the heating element within a few uses. Never in my life have I seen such poor quality in a supposedly ""name brand"" item. I have had other electric skillets that lasted years and years. This one started failing in under six months. I will not EVER buy another Presto product based on this sad experience, and am looking to replace this ASAP. It was quite a disappointment, too ... because the smaller size is handy when cooking for two. Buy something else. Or just set fire to your money. This thing is awful. (Please note the other reviews about this common complaint.)"
1,Presto 06620 11-Inch Electric Skillet (Kitchen,"I purchased this skillet in 08/8/10. I haven't had this skillet a full year - yet the non-stick coatingis peeling off. Not in small places, but wide sections. Even against the inside wall, were you wouldn't think it would peel. I wonder is anyone else having this problem. One man had the same problem with his skiillet, sent it back - received a new one that peeled as well. I like the small size I'll just try my luck with a different brand."
4,Not 11 inches at the cooking surface,"I bought this skillet for my mother in law and she is very happy with it. She cooked bacon and found that no matter where the back was, it sizzled nicely. She cooked pancakes and found no appreciable issues with this. Overall, she was happy.... except - It is 11 inches at the top rim, not 11 inches at the bottom. The sides flare out. She said that she would personally call it a 9 inch skillet.Even so, the skillet is heavy duty and worth buying. I'll just buy the larger size next time."
3,"Good, but could improve.","It seems to heat evenly and is just the right size, which were my main concerns. I would prefer a glass lid."
4,It was hard to find,I didn't use the product. I bought it as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She had an old one that bit the dust and needed a new one. You can't find these with the deep lids very easy. She loves the product.
5,"Cooks almost everything, saves space","How did I get along without this pan? I cook a lot of one-person meals, and this pan is great for that purpose. But, it holds a lot more than I would have guessed from seeing the picture. You can cook main dishes for several people, and side dishes for a larger group because of the depth of the pan. I am a vegetarian, cooking mostly Asian food, and it works for stir-frying, braising, steaming and just about any other method you can think of. The only things I would use my conventional stove for now is boiling big batches of noodles or pasta. This elctric skillet and my rice cooker can handle everything else, and they take up very little counter space. Easy and quick to clean. Most of the time, I can clean it with a damp paper towel and a bit of detergent, don't even need dishwasher:).My only dislike is that the lid is plastic and maybe could break someday, but otherwise this is the perfect pan!"
4,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" the title says it all.",To be Brooks or not to be Brooks. The World is a stage and we're watching Brooks on it. Silly movie with Brooks and his sex jokes written all over it. Mel's wife (Anne Bancroft) costars in this natsy- filled movie. Recommended to Teens only. The rating (PG) is pushing it; a PG-13 would be more suitable. Definitely a movie for a rainy day. (Not Brooks's best work) Anna Bronxy(Wife) Has a affair when her husbent(Mel) is on stage acting.
3,To Be or Not to Be,"To Be or Not to Be is a hum-hum movie, disappointing for anyone who is a fan of Mel Brooks. Brooks and Bancroft (husband and wife in real life) have good chemistry which is probably the only real highlight of this movie. Also, Charles Durning is quite good as Col. Eardhart, but the rest of the movie is dull and uneventful."
2,Not Funny,"Here's the problem with To Be Or Not To Be-Seriousness, that's rigth seriousness. TBONTB is so damn dramatic, according to Mel Brooks the movie was based on Ernst Lubitsch 1942 classic about a man and his wife owing a theater and then being attack by stupid ass nazis. In other words this movie wasn't like other Mel Brooks masterpieces, please Mel don't do more dramatic pictures with nazis in it. It's discriminating"
5,To be or Not to Be,This is one of my favorite movies and I have been hoping to buy it on DVD for some time. It was a reasonable price and I have enjoyed it several times since my purchase. The music and comedy are excellent.
4,Terrific!,This classic VHS feature is one of the best since the original. The packaging was intact and it came in timely manner--thank you!
3,Mediocre Remake of a Masterpiece,"I watched the original Lombard Benny film and this one in an afternoon..............there is no comparison....pacing, acting, set design, dialogue, whatever are vastly superior in the original. Why did Mel Brooks bother?"
3,Wait for the second edition,"as usual with any new software , the sequelae is probably going to be better. i dont know any spanish and didnt know much by the end"
3,Riverdance?,"I was enjoying this CD until I got to track 6 and suddenly I thought I was listening to a Riverdance CD. As the Kenyan Culture Host at BellaOnline.com I'm giving this CD 3 stars as it lacks a certain authenticity was is found in their other CD titled ""Classical Accoustic Recordings from Western Kenya"". I highly recommend ""Classical"" instead of this one. A better set of music from this Luo band than the more polished music of this CD."
2,Not the best Crim Law casebook.,"This book uses unusual cases to present different doctrines of Criminal Law. My professor has admitted on numerous occasions that she would not have selected the same case as the one in the book.There is very little information other than the cases themselves, which is not useful when you are trying to take away a general rule and the only substance on the rule you have is a case from an appellate court in Oregon.If I had a choice as to what Criminal Law book to use for class, this would definitely be near the bottom of the list. I don't recommend buying it unless it is required for your class."
1,Worst book of all time,"This might be the worst book that has ever been written about criminal law. If MY teacher wrote this book, I would go to class and and commit a depraved heart crime against them.If you are forced to use this book in class, SORRY. If you are getting this book for reading otherwise, dont bother."
3,Good,Was fast delivery and product was in fair condition. Was more writing in the book then was described
2,Why are you still in EMS?,"I picked this book up after Devin took a job in our area. The intro was very well written and I thought ""hey this should be great.""But then the book turns into a string of what we would refer to as ""bumper stories"" - 2 minute tales told while sitting on the front bumper of the rescue truck waiting for the horn to blow. Many of the stories have the feel of ""urban legend"" having been passed around NJ for decades and morphing over time.And we all know that ""real guys"" don't talk about emotion - they just complain about how bad things are, so there is nothing in here that I felt captured the motivation that keeps people in this business. Too many ""that was a horrible shift"" stories, but no great saves.Yes, I can recall events like this. But if they were all that made up my day, I would have left years ago.(I did get one smile from a simple line on page 26 - Don't cut a down jacket.Because I've been there.)"
4,It is the job of your life,"Devin relates the trails and tribuations of our nations emergency medicalservices in clear and concise manner. This is a good read for rescueprofessionals as well as for the folks these professionals serve each day. Anote to all you young folks out there that are considering a career in thefield of emergency medical service, read the book, it will open eyes as towhat your getting yourself into. If one is active within the service, Devin'sbook will recall ones memories of their own crazy situations. The type ofincidents you thought could never happen to anyone else. If your justinterested in getting a taste of the life, Devin's book will provide anaccurate account of the life style.How do I know this you ask?I've been a fire fighter/paramedic for the past eight years of my life. Ihope this helps and folks, stay safe, stay healthy and stay happy. We rescueworkers would rather meet you in a social setting not as our patient.Enjoy!!..."
1,How to be an EMT with a bad attitude,"As a volunteer EMT, I enjoy reading about he stories from the field. Many authors share the good and the bad of EMS, but overall reflect on the satisfaction of helping others in their time of need... This is NOT one of those authors. This book tells many stories of calls from the perspective of an EMT with a chip on his shoulder, resenting those he serves, and resenting their requests for help. Another reviewer said the book would set EMS back years, and I have to agree, primarily because of the stories of intentionally mistreating patients, bad attitudes, and off color jokes at the expense of others. If you want to read encouraging stories about life in EMS, consider stores by Canning, Patterson, or Perry. If you want to read about the unfortunate EMT that is always difficult to deal with, and seems to resent his job, this is the book. Advice to the author, if this describes the job of your life, then you might want to consider a career change...."
4,On my second copy,"So, I first picked this book up probably back in 2006. I have since then read it and had it lost among the shuffle at the station. Between loaning it out and getting it back...and now it's gone again. I have recently decided to buy another copy, simply for the fact that we were talking about it at the station, and naturally no one knew where it was. I would suggest this book to anyone! The sequel was just as good as the first! Mr. Kerins did a wonderful job mixing humor and real life. Congrats, sir!"
2,Not what i expected,It was good. i thought it was going to be more serious. There was alot of language didnt like that.
2,Not that new but it's fun,"The points that the author makes aren't new (I have been reading similar tips about personal style and in the other decorating magagzines and books that I have bought for years). Even though the information is not new or original, I do like having this writer's quick tips close at hand for reference. The photos leave something to be desired, because so many of them are little closeups of objects when I would rather see whole rooms."
1,Too narrow in scope,"I like the premise of the book, but the end product looks too New Yorky and bicoastal. There are better, broader decorating books around that make the same ""do your own thing"" point while taking a broader, truly national approach in the choice of places that are pictured. I get so tired of buying great-sounding books only to see that the people who produced them are not well-travelled and have focused on New York and perhaps California. Disappointing. I wish they would show real homes that most of the country can identify with."
5,Enjoyable CD,The Nino Bravo's CDs are in perfect condition. They contain wonderful songs that are truly jewels of Latin music from that time.Thank you very much for the Excellent service.
1,"derivitive, boring read","The book is a rehash of stories that others have written. I would recommend African Folktales by Pantheon, far more authentic and first person. There are also collections by African American authors that have a deeper understanding of black culture than this author."
4,"finally a "" 68 """,My husband has a 1968 elcamino and I have looked for over a year to find it in a toy car. I wish there was a car model to put together too. He was really suprised when I gave it to him.
4,Comfortable!,"I'm the kind of person who walks half a mile rather than bother with the car, so I need shoes that can stand up to that. Lots of women's shoes are flimsy, or uncomfortable to walk more than parking-lot-to-store. These shoes are well-constructed and feel like they will keep me walking for a long time.My feet are a little wide, but these shoes fit well from day one and did not require ""break-in"" or stretching."
1,Don't buy this book!,Princeton Review obviously hasn't done their homework regarding the new AP Biology curriculum. It still reflects the old AP test format and completely omits entire sections. There is WAY to much emphasis on ecology and not enough on cells. Cell signaling and transduction is heavily emphasized in the new curriculum and this book doesn't even mention it!I was looking forward to previewing this book and encouraging my AP Biology students to buy it. I will certainly not be recommending this.
1,Outdated for an update!,"I am extremely disappointed that The Princeton Review completed missed the revision made to AP Biology. As a teacher I purchased this book for students to borrow in preparation for their AP exam, but it will do little good. The course description is inaccurate, the exam set-up is completely outdated, and the sample exams contain questions that will not even be on the exam. Shame on you, Princeton Review! I think you should offer a refund!"
3,Missed the most important change,"The only reason that I pre-ordered this book was that it was for the 2013 exam. This new exam is totally different than previous ones. However, the book missed the part about the new essay questions. There are 2 long FRQs & 4 short ones. There is also no guessing penalty. The book says that there are 4 long FRQs and a guessing penalty. This is a terrible error. The review materials seem correct, though."
1,They have tricked me again...Dont waste your money!!,"So I purchased the version earlier in the year and was very disappointed that the book did not cover the new changes. With this revised version Princeton claimed to have fixed the problems. While on one hand the new practice tests do fit the right format and they made some other changes the rest of the book is WAY out of date. It doesn't even mention the Big Ideas or Learning Goals of the new system and the labs it covers are the old ""Dirty Dozen"". I hoped this ""revision"" would repair my bad view of the Princeton system and it has just made it worse."
1,not up-to-date,"This ""2013 edition"" does not contain any updates pertinent to the newly revised AP curriculum. Nation-wide changes have been made to the 2012-13 curriculum content, including different test make-up (new shorter free response questions in addition to the longer free response essays + more practical application instead of fact-based questions). This text does not even mention any of these changes and I will not be recommending it to my students."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"This book is a complete waste of money as it shows NONE of the changes to the content, the format, anything! I teach AP Biology and I am so glad I picked up a copy to check out before I asked my students to. This book is still written for the old exam and is a complete waste of money."
5,"Very descriptive, concise, comfortable and easy reading","This book makes Biology seem like an easy subject!! It covers a lot of material in a very clear and concise and easy to read manner, and even offers succinct sum-ups at the end of very long stuff, and offers mnemonics to help you remember long lists of things. Example:The Mitosis cyle:I is for InterludeP is for PrepareM is for MeetA is for ApartT is for tearThis book has less information than the AP Barron's book, I noticed. It cuts out a lot of, what it calls, ""unnecessary vocablulary that you don't need to know for the AP Exam,"" and ""unnecessary information."" (Notice the title is ""Cracking the AP Biology Exam"")What I appreciate the most are the compare-and-contrast tables and its very useful diagrams and pictures for visual aid that pretty much kicks Mr. Confusion out of your brain!This book is a lot better than my teacher. I nail her tests now mostly because of this book!"
3,Not the best I've read!,I purchased this for my granddaughter. It was sort of a silly story and did not have much substance but we read it anyhow!
3,Excellent for a second year player.,"Mildly disappointed in the contents, a good variety of selections, but mostly simplified and shortened. Excellent for a near beginner who desires to stretch with familiar sounding music."
1,Just say no,"You must love the Beatles and the soundtrack to ""Oliver"" to enjoy playing from this book. For some, ""enjoyment"" may not be required when looking for material for practice. This book would be perfect for them."
2,Not a Good Gift...,"I bought this as a gift for a floutist friend. Unfortunately, I think they hated it, although she does enjoy playing the flute. I wouldn't buy it for a friend again, but maybe myself."
4,Pretty good selection,"This is good if you're looking for something different. Lots of songs from the same thing (Oliver, Beatles, Elvis), but also a smattering of other ones. Even though there are a lot of the same faces, there are still a lot. It's going to take you a while to work your way through them anyway, and for the amount of songs there, it is a good deal. Good songs, too, just in case you're worried (i.e. no Mexican Hat Dance)."
4,More Good Flute Music,This is another set of good songs for intermediate flute. They will broaden the experience of a beginning flute player. As for giving you music to perform they may not be the best. The binding does not lay flat on a music stand. But you can make copies of the songs you want to perform. There is no piano accompaniment so you either play with no backup or find a good pianist who can fake an accompaniment. Many of these songs are very nice.
5,Excellent for learning,"As an actor in plays and musicals, I have been required to learn several new things. While I was a part of the ensemble in 'My Fair Lady', my director asked me to learn how to juggle. For beginners, baseballs and hackey sacs simply would not do. So I purchased these to help me learn. With much practice and persistence, I eventually learned the art of juggling. The slightly weighted, well, weight of the ball is great alongside the squishy feel of the ball.Speaking from personal experience, if you want to learn how to juggle, these are great for starting."
4,Solid juggling balls,"Bought three black and yellow Squosh balls as I work back into juggling.Good balance and weight for juggling balls. I had purchased three more of the same brand and type several years ago and a few things were noticeable - from the older trio.One of the three was distinctly different in feel, texture & sheen. Not quite a completely different material, but you would definitely believe they would not be matched set. That one also has taken much longer to break in, and the seams all bunched up at one corner which is noticeable in your hand. Given that my prior three that I purchased were all identical, I tend to think that the one different ball is just an offshoot.Overall they can take quite a beating, and I would recommend them to anyone for general juggling use. Definitely if you're starting off - you can't get much better for quality & price."
4,nice size and weight,Good juggle bags...a little slippery so it takes getting used to. A fun toy to have sitting around the house. Someone is almost always using them.
5,Completely Worth The Money,"I received these beanbags a couple of months ago and I would have to say these are one of the best that I have ever dealt with. They hold up great and are extremely durable, i have dropped them on concrete wet grass and hard wood floors and they hold up just fine. I would defiantly recommend these and will be adding more to my collection hopefully soon."
5,Back on Track,"I have always loved this band's live show, but their last album ""Shake your Pelvis"" was over-produced and did not capture the energy of their live show. Welcome to the freakshow, however, is on par with ""I Wanna See You Belly Dance"". Don't get me wrong, the CD could never compare to their live show but this one at least retains the spirit of the band. They strayed momentarily into the netherworld of disco, but after listening to this album, I am happy to report that the Red Elvises are back on track."
3,"Close, but not exact","The original equipment driver's side mat on a CR-V is held in place (avoiding the dreaded mat-creeping-up-under-the-pedals problem) by clips embedded in the floor, attachng to clip holes in the mat. The product here is shaped correctly, but does not have clip holes and is not long enough to add your own holes and use the clips. So it tends to creep forward over time. But it's difficult to find front-only mat sets that fit a CR-V and the price of these is reasonable so all in all I'm fairly satisfied."
1,This is a book for Ages 4-8!,I missed that fact before ordering. If your looking for a clildren's book this one is well done.
4,First Rate!,This was the best...so far... a coffee table book full of information and gorgeous pictures showing the uniqueness and beauty of Yucatan.
3,Not as effective as I was hoping,"I love spicy food. The more garlic, the better. However, my wife can't stand the way my favorites make my skin smell. I was hoping that this product would give me free reign to eat the foods I like without getting ""the look"" and ""the sigh"" for days afterwards. While Cholorfresh did improve the after-effects, it didn't completely eliminate the body odor I normally project after certain foods."
2,It's not all it's cracked up to be,"Um, this doesn't do anything but make your bowel movements green. That is it. Besides making your burps smell like leaves. This only helped my breath on one or two occasions. It does not provide a constant result for my breath.However, I did notice the first couple of days that I took it, my armpits sweated alot less, but all that is gone now. It only worked a short while for meI will be searching for a more effective product that produces lasting results cause this ain't it."
2,"Not so ""Fresh"" for the Price","In this instance I can honestly say, nothing beats the original produt. The price looks great until you realize you have to take twice as many as you did when you were using the ""Original Body Mint"". In additiona to the increased intake is the fact that this product didn't seem to work as well either. Sadly I purchased a bulk supply hoping to save some money, (bad move on my part) this will be the first and last order of this product. I'll gladly pay the higher price for the product that does work."
4,i think they work,so i started taking them... i feel like they work... but i'm not 100% sure... i guess if i stop taking them i'll know...but i'm pretty sure they are working...
1,chlorofresh,I been usin this product and honestly I still feel the same I have not felt or seen any difference I tought that this will start working at least with in one week of treatment ti'll this day I feel the same..
1,Bad taste to chug...,"This stuff is hard to swallow because it tastes bad. I'm not sure it's purpose of deodorizing because I didn't notice any of that. I did notice some deodorizing with powder spirulina, but I had allergic reaction to it as well, so I had to let it go."
1,Chlorofresh liquid- mint,"This liquid chlorofresh mint flavore was horrible, smell was terrible, mint flavor just made it worse. it made me want to throw up and makes your teeth green for a long time.i took it for 3 days and it DID NOT HELP AT ALL. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE CHLOROPHYLL PILL. ALSO GET IT FROM A DIFFERNT COMAPANY."
3,Concerned about alfalfa's estrogenic mimicking ability in estrogen dominance/menopause?,"Alfalfa contains substances such as isoflavones and coumestans, which bind to estrogen receptors in the body. Estrogen binds to these receptors like a key in a lock. If the estrogen level is low and many of these ""locks"" are empty, the constituents of alfalfa -- which resemble estrogen ""keys"" -- bind to them instead and increase estrogenic activity. Alfalfa's estrogenlike ""keys,"" although similar to estrogen, are not nearly as strong. If estrogen levels in the body are too high, the estrogen ""keys"" fill up some of the locks, denying the space to estrogen, thereby reducing estrogenic activity. Because alfalfa may provide some estrogenic activity when the body's hormone levels are low and may compete for estrogen-binding sites when hormone levels are high, alfalfa is said to be hormone balancing."
4,I may have a winner,"So far it seems to be working....I've tried just about everything to cure my chronic bad breath..I brush & floss twice a day, I also scrape my tongue, I use mouthwash, & chew gum, & for years nothing has worked. Based on people's reactions, it seems to be working. I haven't had anyone in the past few weeks cover their nose or casually offer me a piece of gum or a mint. I'm going to use my family members as the true test & ask them to take a whiff. If I pass the sniff test with them, I will be 100% sold on this product. So far I take 2 capsules in the a.m. & 2 in the evening. I'm going to try reducing down to 1 in the a.m. & 1 in the p.m. & see if it still works. Nonetheless, I reiterate so far so good. Also, another reviewer posted that there is one side effect & that is that it makes your bowel movements green...this is true, but if you can live that, the benefits of not having horrible breath far outweigh that one side effect."
5,It's Great for Body Deodorant! Recommend it to Heavy Meat Eaters!,"I've found it! For over 15 years, I've been taking Chlorofresh every other day. The product provide me with odor protection from garlic, meat sitting in my colon for over 3 days due to lack of fiber in my diet, dehydration, or body odor due to fasting. Past two years, I had trouble finding Chlorofresh from GNC, Vitamin World, or any other Brick & Mortar supplement stores. Praise the Lord, it's sold on Amazon. I am loving it!"
3,Not as effective as Body Mint,"I purchased this product because it was cheaper than Body Mint, and I'd figure they'd be the same. Body Mint is wayyy more effective than Chlorofresh. Chlorofresh requires you to take up to 4 (max is 6) pills a day. Body Mint only required for me to take it twice a day and it was effective in regulating my BM but neither were effective in eliminating body odor."
3,Lower dosage and calories,"Cons- These seem to have significantly less active ingredient thanNullo Internal Deodorant, Coated Caplets, 135 Caplets.- Worse, each pill has like 10 calories and two recommended per dose. That's an extra 60 calories per day at full dosage.Pros- As a gelcap, it goes down much easier than Nullo and doesn't as easily stain the hand or mouth.- Per pill, Chlorofresh is cheaper, but it takes about two to equal one Nullo, in my personal experience."
2,Lies,This didn't work for me. Makes your stomach hurt sometimes. Only good is that it contains some copper. I take it as a supplement. Will not buy again.
2,Internal deodorant,I purchased this item over a month ago. This ihas done absolutely nothing for me. No need to purchase again.
2,didnt work for me,"started with just 1 capsule per day, tried for 5 days... all 5 days been having diarrhea... like not even funny... stomach would make loud noises too. I'm still giving a try to every other day, so will see"
1,"Wanted it to work so bad, but...","It didn't work. I was and still am so desperate to get rid of my underarm b.o. that I tried about everything that promises to eliminate odor. So far, none has worked. These soft gels actually made my stomach hurt a little, even though I take them as directed. They also turns the feces green, but didn't eliminate the smell or anything. I found no improvement at all =(. I just want to get rid of my b.o. I've had it since 15 and now I am 21 and have no life because of it. I guess I will continue to search."
5,better than Body Mint!,"I had used Body Mint in the past, I've been on a low carb diet for the past year. When I saw the price difference between this product and body mint ($12 difference) I decided to try this out. I've been using it for the past three days and can already tell a difference. One thing that is important for anyone to know who takes this supplement or body mint is that your poop will be green. It just will, and I didn't know that when i first started using it, so i hope that this little disclosure will help any newbies."
2,Wished it worked for me,This product I must say did work. Just not for me. I noticed a change for the better in my breath and my body in general. It's just that everytime I took them I got horrible cramps. It's too bad because they were great. Maybe they will work for you.
3,okay,i dont feel the difference when Im not taking it i take 3 a day with a little bit of improvement
1,Wrong Description,"I wanted the softgel capsules The picture and description is for the liquid. Makes it hard tNature's Way Chlorofresh, 90 Softgelso order"
3,I'm all mixed up!,"This greatest hits collection is incomplete. The only way to listen to ""Moving in Stereo"" is to hear ""All Mixed Up"" first. The mixing of these two songs is done perfectly on the first album entitled ""The Cars"". Buy that album first - it's one of the greatest first album releases by any band. If you buy this greatest hits collection, you will only hear ""Moving in Stereo"". It just can't be the way The Cars intended it to be."
4,Magic,"Bought this collection from The Cars for their song ""Magic"", and ended up rediscovering a handful of old favorites - Shake it up, My Best Friend's Girl, Drive.Since I'm not a fan of The Cars, I can't gauge the completeness of this compilation. But I do enjoy the aforementioned songs and if you are a fan of The Cars or 80's music in general, then chances are you'll enjoy this set from The Cars."
4,Recycled,"Made in USA in 2002, Serial# R2-78288, Playing Time 79:43To put it simply, there's ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to buy this...Sure, the music is good; like all ""best of"" CDs, one could debate the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain tracks.Lifting tracks from all 7 of their albums (yes, the track ""Tonight She Comes"" which was an exclusive to their ""Greatest Hits"" album is included here), there's absolutely nothing of value here...The CARS released enough good material that it makes it worthwhile to get the individual albums; the ""Just What I Needed"" 2CD set was released for the completists, but I believe that, to a large extent, the CARS made timeless music.Skip this unless you're on a very tight budget..."
3,not as good as other albums,I bought this album to replace another Cars album that was lost. Heartbeat City isn't on this one which I missed a lot. Luckily I found my lost album.
5,"By Far, the Best Compilation of the Band there Is!","This has to be the final word with regards the best ever compilation of the Cars that you can get. All the track selections are great and the sound quality is brilliant! Rhino has done it again with a very well engineered and produced album. If you are looking for the best compilation cd of this band, look no further as this is it! Highly recommended!"
5,Blast from the past!,Reminds me of cruising downtown on Friday nights in 1984. Really great to listen to. What fun times!
5,Which Car Rocks?,"Not every car song is great. This is another classic though.The best song would probably MAGIC. Other than that, I think this is a great CD. You don't need any other Car album."
1,"You really want ""The Complete Greatest Hits""","This album is NOT the end-all, be-all Cars collection. Sure, it's got some of their hits, but if you are looking for one Cars album, get the newer ""Complete Greatest Hits."" You will be far happier. ""Greatest Hits"" will leave you unsatisfied."
2,"2 stars for remastering, 4 stars for music","Rhino really dropped the ball on the remastering on this CD. I'm surprised more people haven't commented. The clarity is excellent, but for example, on My Best Friend's Girl, and Good Times Roll, they have the lead guitar part louder than Ric's vocal, which proves annoying, and even more so when you turn it up to hear him. And then they have the awesome guitar part on Magic mixed behind the synths and bass! What were these guys doing?? It's a great collection of the Car's music at least. If you have the original 1990 compilation, I would suggest hanging on to that and download the missing tracks you want."
3,Good CD,It's the Cars what can I say?! It has music and hits. Probably the last CD I purchased now that we have entered the online music era.
4,"Complete? Not quite, but close enough","This definitely improves on the 1985 release ""The Cars Greatest Hits"", and may appeal to casual fans a lot more than the excellent-but-sprawling ""Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology"". But it leaves out three favorites of mine - ""Candy-O"", ""Don't Tell Me No"", and ""Gimme Some Slack"". All three were singles, but all three appealed more to the band's New Wave fans than the Top 40 crowd. All three of them are available on JWIN, however, JWIN omits the excellent ""Bye-Bye Love"", which should rightly be there side-by-side with its companion piece ""Moving In Stereo"" like it is here on ""The Complete Greatest Hits"".I own JWIN and the Cars' self-titled debut, so I'm as complete as I need to be. This would be an excellent CD for anyone who doesn't care about ""Candy-O"" or any of the other tracks I mentioned above."
4,The Cars,"First of all, I ain't a very huge Cars fan! But the cars aregreat. But they sure get radio played a lot thats for sure.Songs like Just What I Needed, My Best Friends Girl, Good TimesRoll, and Let's Go are all classics. Get the whole collection.Favorite songsGOOD TIMES ROLLBYE BYE LOVELET'S GOMAGICTONIGHT SHE COMES"
3,Not necessary,"I have to disagree with the majority of these reviews, not because this is not a true 'greatest hits' CD, which it appears to be, but because there are only two Cars albums worth owning and if you have these two, you have their best work. Their debut album, The Cars and Candy-O are two genuine classics. The rest is schlock. If you were a Cars fan when they first appeared (I was) they were refreshing, new and fun. But after they found some commercial success, they slid dramatically. It is very difficult to find anyone my age who stayed a Cars fan after Candy-O. Their later stuff is bubble-gum pop at best. So buy the first two albums from the cheap CD bin and skip this one."
2,"Candy-O, I need you so....!","I'm a huge Cars fan. I really enjoyed The New Cars on their tour last year. The question I have with this collection is where is the track ""Candy-O""? The song is so quintesentially Cars. Also, I totally agree with the coomment about the seque ""Moving in Stereo"" into ""It's all mixed up"" not including that was another mistake."
4,ralphm,"I haven't received the cd yet, but I know all the songs. I've been living in Brazil for the last ten years, and every once and a while I think of a band or a song, and say, ""I remeber where I was or what I was doing when I heard it on the radio""I am sure this cd will bring back a lot of memories that I have long forgotten.What's best is that here in Brazil, nobody knows the Cars and I am the ambassador of rock!!"
4,timeless tunes,Great tunes that stand the test of time and are still hot even with the changing musical tastes of the past 20 or so years.
5,The Cars- Complete Greatest Hits,My music library would not be complete without a healthy dose of The Cars and this album is perfect. It includes all the songs I love so much.
4,Nice collection,"This was a nice collection from the dynamic seventies/eighties techno-rock group, with the fun ""Tonight She Comes"" added in, but one glaring omission was ""Hello Again"", the rockingest single they ever released. Yeah, go ahead and hit the ""no"" button if you want, but you rate a ""GH"" release as a whole, not song by song, and as a whole, this deserved a ""4"" for leaving out such a good single."
5,No garlic burps or smells,"The pills smell like garlic, but I haven't experienced any garlic smells or after tastes after taking the supplement. The pills punch through the blister pack very easily and I assume that keeps them fresher than if they were in a bottle. You only need to take one pill once a day. It's a very convenient way to take a garlic supplement."
5,Great product,"Easy to swallow. The pills have a strong garlic oder, but my wife hasn't noticed me smelling like garlic. Blister packed so that each pill stays fresh."
5,Great garlic product,"This product works better, by far, than other garlic supplements. It is effective in lowering blood pressure and does not cause any taste or odor when taken or afterward."
5,Lifes a little better!,"My cholesterol dropped 50 points, and my blood pressure went from pre-hypertensive to completely normal within four months so I'm a believer. I was anyway, but my wife didn't care for the garlic breath. Garlinase is odorless! Trust me! Amazon always has it at the best price, too."
3,"Way cool, for a little while","I got into watching this through apple's site when I was upgrading my Quicktime and was like wow, now this is cool. So went ahead and got it and it is cool. Some more entertaining then others. The music is very midi, like on the early days of the web. I watched it on my big screen and it looks real good. So far no one, including myself, has sat for more than 3 animations in a row. I like it and enjoyed it and will keep it as a permanent part of my DVD collection."
5,Animusic 1&2,"Animusic 1&2My 2-year-old grandson just loves the Animusic DVD's. He plays his drums right along with the music, The one instrument that he always stops to listen to is the gongs! He has the DVD's memorized!"
4,Incredibly fun music,"Our kids love to watch these videos and dance. There's not a ton of movement to catch a toddler's eye, but my 5 year old loves watching the intricate movements. Fun DVD's."
4,Imaginative music appreciation,My son's guidance counselor introduced him to this set of DVD's. We bought it for Christmas for him and it has inspired him in his own music lessons and has enriched his love and appreciation for good music. His artwork even reflects some of the characters from the DVD's. Great product!
5,Musical masterpiece,"An amazing fusion of sound and sight. The animations are awe-inspiring visual creations of cutting-edge computer animation. The music explores all genres with equal fidelity (exception: No rap pollutes this musical masterpiece.) Reminiscent of the musical talent of Emerson Lake and Palmer and the visual performances of Manheim Steamroller, with better special effects than Star Wars."
4,amazing annimation,I first saw an animation on public broadcasting and was inspired to find out whether there were any CD's of animusic for sale.Animusic #1 has more variety to the annimation than #2 but both CD's show what amazing imaginations these guys have. I am also a graphic artist so I can appreicate all the time and money that went into the making of this project.Both the annimation and the music are beautiful and played the CD's several times and don't get tired of viewing them.
5,Animusic 1 & 2 Computer animation video albums in DVD's,"They are just great!! Everyone who has seen them marvel at the ingenuity and creativity that went into the making of these items. We saw a sample of it on TV and I immediately checked with Amazon regarding availability of purchase.Never disappointed with any items purchased through Amazon, and feel very safe in ordering due to their guarantees."
3,Very Victorian,"This Victorian era story of a coward trying to atone for his act of cowardice is, well...very Victorian. The author has good insight into human nature in regards to cowardice, bravery, guilt, and a sense of duty, but there is so much melodramatic soul-searching (especially by Ethne) that parts of it become quite tedious. The dance of deception between Ethne and Durrance is just painful and the author beats it to death before getting back to the story of Harry Feversham.I think the author was trying to make the reader feel sorry for the poor emotional suffering of brave Ethne, but for the most part I found her more annoying and misguided than pitiable. I really liked the premise and overall story of the book, but the melodrama of it all severely detracted from my enjoyment of it."
4,'Inheritance',"My Papa died when I was 9. I did not know until my sister (10 years my senior) told me that he loved to read. Living on a farm in the '30s and '40s meant no TV and probably no news-paper delivery. My sister would bring books home from the school library for my Papa to read. She said his favorite was ""The Four Feathers"". What a joy for me to find it on Amazon and while I read it I will picture him doing the same."
1,butchered version of a great classic,"This book is NOT Four Feathers. It may be Two and one half feathers. It is mercilessly abridged, but if you haven't seen the original, you won't know how you are being cheated. Be warned and stay away."
4,Christmas present,My son received this as Christmas present and he was very happy to get it - this one was high on his list.
3,Dog fights,Overall an okay game but it did require re-booting my PSP. Not as much detail as I had hoped for but will provide a diversion from work or while on an airplane.
3,Good for a rental only,"A little repititious, no full controls, i went thru the missions quickly then sold it. Ace combat gives more extended gameplay-gamelife. I hope thier are more flying sim types games in the works for psp."
5,A Diamond Waiting For Discovery,"This is one of my all time FAVORITE cd's on the planet. I don't know why Cory isn't more mainstream. The cd is about injured souls trying to recover, being grateful for what you have, letting go of the past...just beautiful music to fill up your home, mind and heart. She is incredibly talented and insightful in her lyric writing, and there's just something about her music that stays with you. I've had this cd for over 9 years now and it never grows old. I saw her in a small concert in Santa Barbara a while ago and she was great live as well. I will remain a true admirer of hers for as long as she keeps making her beautiful music."
4,Not a bad wee album,"I've been a fan of ABW for quite a while now.. Awesome riffs, and spacey solos accompanied by crashing drums and killer bass..The new songs aren't the best I must admit, but the 13 or so live tracks, truly give you the feel of what they sound like live, which aint bad.If I have one complaint it's that they haven't changed up the songs (they're pretty much the same as they aappear on the previous albums) unlike Fu Manchu in Go for IT live who have re-jigged afew of their tunes to give them a fresh feel.They're playing in front of a bunch of yokles from Hicksville, Alabama who are painfully loud at times, but all in all, this album would go dwon well with any fan of The Bitchwaxs's riffs.. Also, features is a bonus DVD of the live show. Don't expect bells, whistles or fireworks. This is pretty much stand and deliver stuff.. But cool nonetheless."
5,"great ep , live album & dvd all in a 2 disc package","what there to say except that TAB is the best jersey band next to monster magnet !!!!!!! the 4 studio songs are awsome one of them being a remake of a song off the 1st album , the live part of the album is the part i love the most & you can really hear the fire & power of this band , this is the last release with their original drummer keith ackerman so i totally suggest this to anyone with good musical taste !!!!!!!! \m/\m/"
4,Live the life of Viking whilst reading the book,"This is it, it is very illustrous book with a lot of detais, facts, names, relations and so on. Highly recommended to anyone who likes Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden, Vikings and middle ages."
5,Heartwarming,This is a wonderful feel good Christmas read. If you're looking for a short story to warm your heart this is it.
5,The Santa Shop,THE SANTA SHOP REVIEWI had to tell you about a wonderful book called The Santa Shop. I want to thank Tim Greaton for creating something so inspiring and intriguing and sharing it with the world in this amazing book. There is such insight and depth to the story and the characters in a unique development that carries the reader to greater a intensity than a mere story could create. This story brings feeling and understanding of others and carries the reader into the heart and soul of another in the depths of despair. The reader moves smoothly on this man's traumstic journey finding the conclusion one of delightfully coordinated complexity that leaves a person with warmth in their heart and hope for the world. This is a book I hope everyone gets and reads but the copy that I have I will keep and treasure. The deeper you look into this book the more you will find. You will find something special.
3,A nice little Christmas story,"I think this is a good author, and this was well edited, something I really appreciate. This was a nice little story to help you get in the mood for Christmas, but the story just didn't grab me. I would like to read something else by the author, because I think I would like him, with a different subject matter."
4,An emotional read,"The Santa Shop is filled with thoughts of death, despair, guilt, fear, and anger. But in the end HOPE arrives. This is a book worth reading!"
5,The Santa Shop By Tim Greaton,"I thought this book was wonderful. It was very up lifting and very heart-felt. I loved the characters and the mystery that kept you on through out the novel. I also liked the writing style very much and thought that it put and extra spark to the story. I really enjoyed how Tim made you feel a very strong connection with his character and made the life experiences so real that you can feel the emotions just as strong with the character. This story had very natural life like resemblances to what you might actually feel or do if you were put in this situation. Tim Greaton has a very unique writting style and I can't wait to read his other novels.If you like up lifting stories that will bring your spirit up and make you think, this is the book for you. This was a wonderful book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!EnjoyThe Santa Shop (The Santa Conspiracy)"
3,I guess I found this book to be a little to different for my liking...,I just didn't care for this story line very much. I like Christmas books to be a bit more traditional.
2,Lacking any development,"I'm surprised to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews of this book. The plot could have been interesting if there had been any attempt at character development or fleshing out of details, but it was just page after page of bare bones information without the detail needed to make it interesting. The writer made the mistake of telling the story instead of showing the story. It read more like a plot summary than a book told by a narrator who should have been emotionally involved but instead came across as if looking at the incidents through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars making the events seem small and lacking detail."
1,Abrupt End and Very Unsatisfying.,I go t this book as a free Kindle download and am glad I didn't pay for it. It was an interesting story but the writer just stopped telling it. The ending was completely unsatisfying and left far too many questions. It was as if the writer just got tired of writing and stopped. Would not recommend it at all.
1,The Santa Shop (The Santa Conspiracy - book 1),I am not surprised that this book is sold for free. I couldn't pass the tenth page. It is a really bad reading.
4,Christmas in the Summer,"Who says that Christmas-themed books are only for December? I just finished this feel-good story and I'm in a good mood that should last until the next book. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll just say that this book follows a journey from heartache and guilt to redemption. People are innately good, and you can tell that the author believes this. And I bet after reading that you won't dismiss a homeless person as a nonentity again."
5,I enjoyed this,The man went through so much and even though it seem as though he found an excuse not to carry through with his plan; he had every intention of doing so. He was meant to experience every situation he was put in and finally reach a satisfying ending--he just needed time to heal and get pass his guilt.
3,The Santa Shop,"I enjoyed the story, but felt that the story was a little slow. I would read anther of this authors books."
1,Didn't hold my interest,I deleted this after several chapters. I was bored and not entertianed by the story. I did not get it.
5,Awesome book!,"This is the first free book that I have read and of course I was skeptic since it wasn't by a real well known author. Once I started reading this book though, I couldn't stop! The book kept me interested until the end. I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I would recommend this book to others."
5,Every town should have a Santa Shop!!,"Tim has written a wonderful book, more about life than Christmas, which was an inspiration to me. His characters are alive and you feel as if you know them. You hurt when they hurt, love when they love, and feel what they feel. His descriptions put you right there and I wanted to help!! So much of life packed into this story, and I was wishing for more at the end!A must read for everyone; read it to your children! I will be watching for this author's works!!"
5,Great Read,"I want to believe whole heartedly that Gray, Vermont and The Santa Shop exist. Real or not, they will forever be alive in my mind. The power of this book rests in the author's ability to walk us through the depths of despair, making us feel Skip's desperation and allowing us to truly understand why he believes suicide is the only way to atone for the death of his wife and son. This book is filled with loneliness, sadness and the utter loss of faith. And then something amazing happens. After we have emotionally joined Skip in his desperate search for an end to his pain, the author moves not just the character but also the reader to a better place. Yes, I know with all my heart that Skip's pain is real. And that what makes this journey so amazing. Our belief grants it impact and power. While the title might sound like a feel good story, The Santa Shop is more about hopelessness and recovery. I know I recovered. A very worthy read by a wonderful author."
4,Good Product & Good Value,"This is exactly what I wanted and I would have rated it with a 5, but for the somewhat exhorbitant shipping & handling charge - 50% of the cost of the watch! Still, even with that, it was a good value."
5,great music,"These artists produce a great sound on this CD. The songs are great and this CD is most likely one of the best of traditional regional Thai music. If you like Laotian music as well or are interested, the sound is very similar. I was not dissapointed at all, this CD is worth the money."
2,overpriced and uncomfortable,"I always buy ventilated shoes for summer hiking and decided to splurge based on looks. It's hard to get a good feel for a new shoe because it hasn't broken in so I bought them thinking the extra cost would mean they were more durable. It's been a month and I've worn these every day with about 30+ miles of walking overall. Every step feels like walking in huge leather work boots. The huge solid squarish back of the shoe doesn't roll down, it just pivots and smacks the rest of your foot down on every step. I keep thinking the sole will break in but it hasn't. My poor feet ache if I walk even a mile.What's good about them? The venting is ok but not as much as a running shoe or something like that. Absolutely perfect fit on the inside and didn't have any issues with chafing while breaking them in.You'd probably be better off buying some cross trainers."
4,Very comfortable-However. . .,"I ordered one whole size bigger than I normally wear because I would be wearing a slightly thicker sock. However, when I tried them on they were too small. I have to return mine and go even bigger. I could still tell the design was very good quality and so comfortable even though it was too short. So, I would say they run small so order a larger size.I would recommend this product to someone else. My only disappointment was that I had to return them, therefore having to wait even longer to wear them."
3,Uneven construction,"These are nice looking, sturdy shoes. I ordered a half size larger, based on reviews that they run small, yet they were still too short in the toe. These shoes are padded heavily in the heel, but they don't feel very cushioned in the arch and forefoot. It seems that this unevenness propels the foot forward in the shoe, hence the toe smashing. At least, my toes were. Lots of room above the toes, though, which makes me think these might be better with orthotics, if you wear them. Even if I wore orthotics, I think they'd still feel like ""too much"" in the heel."
5,For Everything!,"I was shopping for hiking shoes and found these. They are really cute on, and I find that I grab them often to wear just for everyday, because they are so comfortable and cute! I would highly recommend them!"
