1,Bad Seed was very bad indeed.,I purchased Bad Seed to use in my nutrition class. I was very disappointed. It had no narration to lead the events and the videography was very amateurish.
3,No copy receipt function,"and won't print on duplicate paper. You can set it to print receipts OR print a sales journal but not both. If you need to record individual sales AND give out customer receipts, then this otherwise nicely streamlined and easy to use cash register is not for you.The printer doesn't press hard enough for use with duplicate paper rolls and there is no way to program it to print another copy of the receipt. Too bad, this simple feature would make it perfect. It does print a very basic summary report of each department's sales totals with total cash/credit/check sales when prompted. But just the totals.So head's up if you need a copy receipt or duplicate printing function, this model won't do."
1,Slow and Dry,"The ink for this register is contained in a tiny foam roller about 1/2 inch long and 3/8 inch in diameter. Consequently, the ink gets depleted very quickly. The customer service rep for the company which makes replacement ink rollers for this machine told me that this tiny ink roller is intended for a calculator and not suitable for a cash register which would be used frequently in a retail environment.I returned this unit and, for a few dollars more, bought a Casio PCR-T265, which has a thermal printer."
3,It works well but not a battery operated register,I bought this register to use at an outdoor mkt without electricity. It only has battery back up not battery operation. The register works fine when plugged in.
4,Simple Small Business Register - Recommended,"We use this Sharp XEA102 cash register for our small business, both in the shop and at shows, and have been fairly happy with the features and performance. This is about as basic as we would want to go since we need the ability to assign product keys to keep track of different categories of sale items. Here are my observations:Pros-+ Good Basic Functions; can set tax rate, product keys, daily totals, etc+ Easy to Use; once setup (see ""Cons"" below), it is easy to run and to teach employees to useCons-- Cumbersome to Setup; following the directions will work, but far from intuitiveThis meets our needs and has been very reliable, even after moving it around between the shop and several shows a year.Recommended!CFH"
3,Nick Nolte + Don Johnson + Macon County=Trouble,This movie is pretty enjoyable for the early Nolte and Don Johnson performances. It functions on the level of a Bonnie and Clyde type story and covers some ground that TWO-LANE BLACTOP covers a little better-but it still got it's charm!
3,yup lets go no where fast,ok so what if this movie has no plot. its still cool. i just bought another copy ! this was before all the special affects stuff and before don married melanie!. i thought miami vice was cool when it first aired on tv and watching the reruns sure make me feel old. but i havent taken a dirt nap yet and i love the action in these old movies. heck movie stars had to start somewhere i am greatful that amazon has a selection and i hope they will expand it! movie onnnnn
4,This Movie Needs to be on DVD/Blueray!!!!!!!,"As a car buff, I collect all car related DVD's. My VHS is worn out.This Movie Needs to be on DVD\Blueray!!!!!!!"
2,not that great,"very displeased, bought jewel in the sun, thought it was very good, then i got this one and now i know her other albums suck."
5,great product,"instructions are detailed, simple to build frame, easily adaptable to your table, very accurate cuts, simple to make fine adjustments, I would recommend to anyone needing accurate measurements"
4,Wayyyy overpriced,"What I like most about this box of goodies is the surprise. Your not exactly sure what your going to get and for me that was the best part. However this is incredibly overpriced. I goggled an Asian food grocer and got ALL the items that came in the box and more for around $38 including shipping. If you want the surprise get this, if you know what your getting and want specific items buy elsewhere."
1,Not worth it.,Way way way overpriced. I can get this same set at the Japanese market for around $20. Save yourself the $40.
4,Over 50 photographs of an extremely handsome young man,"Steven Underhill photographs one of his most popular models, Jeff Conger, in a braod range of settings. The settings are primarily set in the countryside, in the barn and the fields. However there are other interior photographs with diffused light that are very attractive. The model is so handsome that the quaity of the photograph may be overlooked. That would be a shame since Underhill is a superb photographer. There are over 50 photographs. Conger is half dressed in all of them but there are no fully nude photographs. The format for the book is small, about 6 inches by 6 inches. All the photographs are black and white. You might think that over 50 photographs of the same model would be restricting or boring, but this is not the case since Conger is not only extremely handsome and beautifully built, but his personality and relaxation with the photographer are evident in all the photographs."
2,book is too small,"I was able to take a look at this book in a bookstore before buying here. I will definitely NOT buy this book, only because of it's size. It's a 6X7 book - NOT a larger format coffee table book. (remember, a sheet of paper is 8.5X11, so the books is smaller than that!)It looked like a kids 'golden book' in size. 'artistic' pics like this just cannot be appreciated in such a small format. There are plenty of other books of cute/hot guys that are a proper cofee table size where you can enjoy the photography. I suggest passing this one up."
3,Purely an European invention,"I have explored the great cathedral in Puebla, I have meditated upon the Aztec calendar stone in the Museo de Antropologia, I have attended Mexican weddings and I have studied the native language Nahuatl.This is a European Harp Consort - it is not Mexican. At the least it could have included Mariachi music. It has no sense of time: 1588, 1820, 1917. It cannot tell the difference between Mayan and Toltec.It is a very pleasant album to listen to, but it is NOT Mexican."
5,Once In a Blue Moon,"Every once in a while I find recordings that not only feed my sybarite appetite but also inspire me. This is one of them. Flawless musicianship, high quality recording, refreshing theme, and the beautiful music contained in this CD will excite anyone with a thirst for pleasure."
1,French Burnt Peanuts,"Oct. 14, 2006I am very disappointed with this company-The Candy Wholesale Company. Simply because I never received my order even after being assured by customer service that it was on its way.The only efficient thing they did was to quickly refund my money when I realized that I would never receive my order.Ron Haralson"
4,Grease - deluxe dition,"This edition has a second CD with instrumental versions, alternatives, sing a long, etc, that gives a bonus to a disk connected to a beautiful era.the sound is excellent, which gives you a few extra points. Recommended for those who like soundtracks. This is already a classic.esta edicion tiene un segundo cds, con versiones instrumentales, alternativas, sing a long, etc, que le dá un extra a un disco relacionado a una hermosa época pasada.el sonido es excelente, lo que le dá unos puntos extra. Recomendado para quienes gusten de las bandas de sonido. Esta ya es un clásico."
1,"Not much archeological record, a lot of surmise","Mr. Herm is German, and a professional documentary film maker. He tells an intriguing tale of a Indo-European people called the Celts, closely related to the Italians. The Celt set of languages was also closely related to Latin, and the Celt history was one of constant expansion, and forced migration. Ultimately though, this book is flawed, because no one speaks for the Celt except the Celtic enemy. Because the Celts maintained all their governance, history and religion in a spoken language, their culture is essentially lost to us. What remains are Roman accounts of the Celts, and this is a book about Roman campaigns against the Celts. Blow this one off unless you're doing research out of the library."
2,It started out OK,"But after the chapter on ""Atlantis"" I began to wonder about the rest of the book. Completely ruined the book after that."
2,Diplomacy,"This was bought for our 23 year old son as a Christmas gift. He loves to play the game with his friends. The product, although old was in very good shape. He and his friends are probably have a good time wanting to kill each other while playing ""Diplomacy."" Personally, I do not like to play the game."
3,Definitely a cookbook for the information age,"Like many parents, we were interested in getting our kids more involved in the kitchen, so we decided to try this cookbook. Unfortunately, this one didn't really do it. There are lots of big, bright colors, lots of big pictures, and not too many ideas overall.If your kids are really on the young side, then this might just work. But if you have kids that are already in the kitchen, making their own (cereal, sandwiches, etc) and looking to expand, they are probably already beyond this cookbook. While there are a handful of recipes within that may be of use to them, most of those are probably things you already do or could be picked up elsewhere."
4,Betty Crocker Kids Cook!,"Betty Crocker does a good job in breaking down definitions and steps in cooking to a very basic level. This cookbook would be most appropriate with younger kids. The book has a lot of odd cartoon characters, apparently to appeal to children, but they are odd-looking and do not seem to add to the book's function or appeal. I would rather see more recipes and larger photos of the actual food. In a nutshell: more cookbook, less picture book."
4,Purchased as a gift,"Well finally a cookbook with pictures. I am thrilled. This version also came as a spiral bound, which makes it easier to keep the book open on the page you're using. I don't know what the recipies taste like, but at least you can see a picture of what it's supposed to look like. Thank you Betty Crocker!"
3,Basic but Not a Complete Waste,"I had some version of this book when I was 9 and I loved it then! It taught me basic techniques, and some recipes. I think that this book would be helpful for kids who know very little about cooking."
3,Bought for my 7 year old,"We got this book for our 7 year old for Christams. I wanted a clearly set out book with basic recipes as he loves to help out in the kitchen and his Dad is a great cook. The book is quite good, and the recipes are simple enough that he can follow them with minimal supervision. They all sound wonderful with wacky names, but I was dissapointed that this book uses a lot of packet mixes and pre prepared foods. It is more like an assembling book than a cook book. I really wanted something that would teach him basic cooking techniques, where as this focuses on the end result not the process. He still enjoys the book though and at least it is fostering his enjoyment of cooking."
1,way too basic,I found the Betty Crocker cookbook for kids was limited in actual recipes. I had thought of it for my 11yr old granddaughter but when I received it I was very disappointed in fact I returned it because even for my 7 year old grandson it was too basic. The recipes were things they already cooked. Way too much reading and too little recipes. Not a great job from Betty Crocker.
2,Loud. Obnoxious. And Not Enough Recipes.,"You know how it grates when you're exposed to a really really loud car stereo? That's what this book is visually. I am not interested in using a cookbook that 1) hurts my eyes and 2) isn't very original. I mean, don't kids get enough stimulation nowadays without printing a cookbook this garish?If you're looking to get the kids into the kitchen, save your money for The Everything Kid's Cookbook or Mommy and Me, both fantastic books for that purpose; or for ultra kid-friendly new recipes, Beyond Mac'n'Cheese (by MOPS), or if you're really serious about family cooking, The Cook's Illustrated Family Cookbook, all excellent selections.For healthy alternatives, get the BH & G's Kid's Favorites Made Healthy--a really excellent book with lots of recipes that are charming and easy to make. Skip this tome, which aside from scarring your retina, is mundane at best."
1,NOT IMPRESSED,I bought this book thinking it would be something like the Betty Crocker kids cookbook I had when I was little. I was really disappointed. I wouldn't even call it a cook book. There aren't many true recipes in it. Betty Crocker could have done better.
4,Great for kids,"This is a fun and easy book for kids who want to try cooking. My children are 12 and 8 and had no problems with the recipes we tried, with my supervision of course."
5,Kids Cook,This was well recieved by my 12 year old boy. He has been empowered to make things and he's already searching for his favorite new recipe's to make. This has good pictures and easy recipe's to follow.
2,Disappointing.,Too much clutter on the pages --more childish than I had hoped for. It is very colorful and lots of photos but the layout was very cluttered.
5,Christmas Gift,"Great Granddaughter love it, could hardly wait to make something from it.I am sure she has made one if her favorites from the book. Thanks"
3,the easter bunny gifts,This cook book has great receipies with healthy food. I was a little ever zelous that my 5 years old boys would like this book. May be next year they will be old enough
1,Betty Crocker Kids Cook,This is not for kids who truly are interested in cooking. Disappointing evolution from the one that I used as a kid and from the one my kids used. This one is more comic book than cookbook.
3,confusing format,"I found the layout of the book too confusing. Yes, the pictures are vibrant and eye-catching. However, the instructions jump around in ""bubbles"" all over the page making it difficult to follow what to do next. I also found the business of the illustrations distracting. To be honest, though, I'm not a 4 to 8 year old, and I didn't actually try any of the recipes."
3,It's OKAY...,"I personally like the book, but reading this to my kids was a drag. They wouldn't pay attention. They didn't care. And they said it was boring. The pictures are REAL pictures, and not illustrations.My kids are 6 and 4 years old. Maybe in 2 or 3 years they'll appreciate it. I don't know."
4,1956 Arrau - Chopin Complete Etudes and Allegro de concert,"As other reviewers have mentioned this is an historic recording. But, for me there are two incredible tracks that are worth the price of the CD. They are the ""revolutionary etude"" Op 10 n 12 and the Allegro de concert Op 46. Arrau takes an agnostic approach to the Op 10 n 12 etude - senza pedale (without the sustaining pedal) and rolls off a fantastic performance. This is truly a unique and fascinating read. The Allegro de concert, a work far too neglected in the Chopin ouvre, displays Arrau's phenomenal technique while maintaining wonderful balance and cohesiveness.There are other gems: the great ""Winter Wind"" and ""Ocean"" etudes, Op 25 ns 11 & 12, are stunning standouts. Others are the Op 10 ns 3,5,7, 10 and Op 25 ns 1, 2, 3 , 5, 8 & 9.Arraus virtuosity and artistic insights certainly expiate the 1950's sound limitations. Recommend without reservation."
3,Mr. Big should say : Mr. Gilbert thank you for giving us fame!!!,Dont get me wrong. I love this band. This is the last great Mr. Big album. Ritchie Kotsen replaces Paul Gilbert in the following album. Kotsen couldnt carry Giberts groceries to his car let alone take his place in this band. It sounds like Paul had other ideas for this album but had to settle for what the remaining members wanted. It is still a great album non the less. Im not saying Kotsen sucks but I am saying that Paul Gilbert is that good.
1,Sub-par,"This CD in my estimation is less than one star. It is very ordinary - reminds me of an average church choir. Very plodding. I bought it as a Christmas present for my wife. After listening to a few songs, she asked me if we could return it. Wish we could."
5,"""Must"" reading for students of metaphysics and spirituality.","Psychic Politics: An Aspect Psychology Book focuses on the links between ordinary, everyday life and the greater Reality that nourishes all existence. The late Jane Roberts (1929-1984), the author of the Seth books, was considered to be one of the foremost psychics of our times and in Psychic Politics introduces three concepts that are key to understanding the entire body of her literary and metaphysical work: the library (a super-real storehouse of ""probable"" books that tell of the paths human consciousness has not yet taken); Counterparts (simultaneous incarnations living on earth today so as to broaden the fabric of their individual soul's experience); and the codicils (an alternate set of rules for human existence that have the capacity to transform the framework of human civilization. Psychic Politics is ""must"" reading for students of metaphysics, psychology, and human spirituality."
5,Now I can understand!,"I am uneducated with regard to opera, but wanted to learn more. I liked the opera DVD's because they have subtitles! I can listen to the gorgeous music AND actually know what's going on in the plot!"
4,Amagnificent film,"I agree with the previous reviewers that the only scene that stops me giving this a 5 star rating is the ludicrous appearance of the ""wicked uncle"" in the first Act. It is childish and totally inappropriate to a film that is otherwise so believable."
2,Weak soprano,"Very disappointed. The soprano was weak, voice lacked any power - esp. striking in the One Fine Day aria. Acting was stoic. I've seen this opera a lot, and this Butterfly didn't get off the ground."
2,A mediocre performance of an excellent opera,"First, you should realize that this is not Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly. It is, as the titles say, a Mitterrand movie based on the Puccini opera. Unfortunately, the opera is much better than the movie.As other reviewers have mentioned, the fact that Butterfly's uncle (the priest) floats in the air is silly and detracts from the movie, as does the b&w; pictures during the humming chorus. Also, the interuption of the music for scene changes within the act is distracting - it reminds me of the interuptions on the old 78rpm records of operas.In addition to the problems such as those mentioned above, the singing was only mediocre, so I cannot recommend this DVD."
3,Puzzling choices,"More and more directors are choosing to expose the musical fantasy that is opera to cinematic reality. In this Butterfly, that reality is compelling, except for some very puzzling and peculiar directorial choices. The most glaringly ridiculous of these is that Cio-Cio-San's uncle, the Bonze, an all too real character in the libretto, appears floating in the air. The grounded characters seem as perplexed by this as I was. Such silliness destroys the film's otherwise down-to-earth visual realism. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
2,Clips of Nagasaki,The voices are passable. Butterfly is no beauty. The dubbing in of scenes in black and white of that era to accompany one of the most beautiful interludes in opera is a sheer disaster. I wish I could somehow block out that section and just hear the music. My immediate solution is to close my eyes and just listen. I'm hoping a new Butterfly will be made without this idiotic dubbing.
3,madama Butterfdly,I found the images way too dark not like the real movie. The singing is quite good but the darkness of the movie really turned me off. This was not the movie I remembered and loved so much ! Maybe I don't know how to work my DVD yet ; that's a possibility !The music still remains beautiful though !Johanne Denhez
1,Can't Watch Anymore,"Big American buffoon plucks exotic Japanese butterfly from all she knows and abandons her only to return and steal her child. When I first watched this, years ago, I cried and cried. Now I am grown up. The tragedy is that this is still business as usual for imperialist america and capitalism (and britain, france, israel)- we want you/yours, we take you, we use you up, we abandon you and we blame your tragic end on you.Beautiful music."
3,a little disappointed,"my husband and i went to italy the first time in 1988. i bought this book at the vatican from the author, who signed my copy. it was a beautiful large book and so helpful while looking at the ruins. i was a little disappointed when i received the copy of the book that i bought for my brother, who is going to italy for the first time this march. it is very small and compact (which is good for traveling) but is missing some of the three page overlays. i'm happy that i can send the smaller version, but i wish i would have known the size. it makes a difference."
3,"good read, but lacks the punch of the first three books","This is Harry Turtledove's 7th book in the series and probably the 4th best of the 7. The first three were the best while the 4th book was extremely slow to develop. I enjoyed reading all of the books because Turtledove has an excellent writing style and great character development. You definitely will not enjoy reading it as much if you have not read the first 6 books. Although each book is long compared to other authors, I read through them much quicker than I could have imagined due to the quality of the writing."
3,More Of The Same.,"If you read the book before this one, or any of the preceding series, you will know what to expect in this book and probably won't be disappointed. The strength of the series remains in the character development and global scope. There is also the occasional surprise to see how this alternate history differs from real history.However, it soon becomes apparent that the characters are having the same conversations every time they meet...and those conversations are almost exactly like what they discussed in the previous book. The plot moves slowly and the overall story line is really only advanced in the last 150 pages. While I remain interested in seeing how this series turns out, I don't feel like reading the same thing in every book. Here's hoping Turtledove straightens things out in book 3."
3,Another great entry in the series...,"Well, it's time to see how the world is doing in the aftermath of the first interstellar war. It turns out that things aren't going so well. Political tensions are high between the Greater German Reich, the USSR, the USA, England (teetering towards fascism), Canada, South Africa, and Israel. Add a new nuclear power into the mix as well and you have what leads into the final book in the Worldwar series. Unfortunately, I don't think things are going to end well. Many returning characters wind up learning things they shouldn't and betrayal is a constant threat from every side. I hope that things get better in the last book, but that's probably too optimistic of me. One star off for putting JFK and Kruschev on the cover of the book but not in the text."
5,An excellent book,"Harry Turtledove writes too much, and sometimes -- as in the case of ""Into the Darkness -- it shows. But this must have been the book he was neglecting ""Darkness"" to work on. The characters grow steadily more interesting, the sociosexual goings-on among the Lizards get more fascinating, and the action keeps going. But, oh, Sam Yeager should have restrained his curiosity! Worth the hardcover price, even to a cheapskate like me."
4,Another Good One,"Dr. Turtledove once again continues to keep his readers involved. In this second book of Colonization he continues the stories that made the first intriguing. He also, managed to start a new segment, the young hatchlings (Mickey and Donald), that is particularly entertaining.sPerhaps, his greatest triumph, is making humans understand both the Tosevites and the Race's sides of the story and problems. It is another great book.My only complaint is the lack of a map. Granted he tells you where it's all happening, but being visual, I like to see it, without having to look back in the first book. Nevertheless, a great book, if you like Turtledove and/or alternate history, read this book."
4,Still Interested....I think,"Down To Earth was a good read, but lacking in military action. The cover is misleading in that I don't recall John Kennedy or Nikita Kruschev (and his shoe) even appearing in the story. (I realize that is probably done by the publisher rather than Turtledove)In fact, the whole book was a good read, but not a great/exciting one like the Worldwar series. Although the loose ends at the end of DTE have me ready to read the next book, it needs a lot more military strategy and action.I'm a little afraid Mr. Turtledove is straining to meet possible contract commitments to turn out a certain number of books rather than write the really good SF he is capable of."
5,Excellent,"Turtledove, building on what has gone before in WorldWar and Second Contact, has built a believable world, in what should be an unbelievable situation. Without spoiling what happens, we are witness to a complex situation, in a world that has (4) superpowers - The (alien) Race, the USA, the USSR and the Greater German Reich. Turtledove gives us varying perspectives ranging from Molotov, the leader of the Soviet Union, to Glen Johnson, a US astronaut, to Sam Yeager, an American expert on the Race, to various members of the Race ranging up to the Fleetlord Atvar. He covers a lot of ground from Ginger smuggling to race relations, to a conspiracy, to international sabre-rattling. Overall, an excellent read. But do not let anybody spoil the last 100 pages!"
2,From WorldWar to WorldBore.,"The series gets very talky and devoid of action. The pluck and ingenuity employed by the humans in the WorldWar series has given way to ex-tough guy Sam Yeager wringing his hands and whining about the planet's would-be subjugators: ""Lizards are people toooo!""Turtledove didn't seem to want to bother with writing out interesting battle scenes this time around, and he lazily skims over the big fight between the Third Reich and the Lizards. His tantalizing introduction of Ayatollah Khomeini in the last book continues to be a dud; apparently his role is little more than a walk-on.Shouldn't characters (JFK and Khrushchev) pictured on the cover of the book actually be mentioned somewhere in the text?"
3,good in some parts but rubbish in others,having read the 4 World War books and the colonization books i feel that the only way to end this series is either humanity is totally taken over or there's a time jump to when humanity the invaded the lizard homeworld. don't get me wrong i enjoy the series but i am not going to waste money on books that continually say the same thing over and over again.
5,Another remarkable installment!,"This is the best sci fi series I've read. I marvel at Turtledove's vivid imagination and uncanny ability to characterize the lizards. I get so engrossed in his books that they seem utterly real to me. There are many characters in the book, some not so likeable as others, but I think he does a good job maintaining continuity. As fine as the characterization is, let's not forget this is primarily a work of plot, and the twists and turns do not disappoint. I hated to finish the book, because the wait for the next installment will seem so long. This is one series I hope continues for many more volumes! I'd appreciate any recommendations from other readers who love this series."
5,Reccomended,A wothry continuation of the saga! Lots of surpirese alnog the way and pretty solid writting. Leaves you wanting more.
3,"Ghosts in lost Graveyard of Lebanon, VA","My name is Richard Fulgham, author of ""The Hogs of Cold Harbor"", ""The Embracing Woods"", ""The Lion of Saint Catharine"", ""Appalachian Genesis"" and ""Man's Laughter: Anatomy of a Manhunt"". What I say here is true. I met Mr. Taylor in the late '90's when I was a reporter for the Lebanon Newspaper in Russell County, VA. I'd discovered a 200+ yr old graveyard near North Street, all grown over with trees and undergrowth. Some of the trees were three feet thick. Amongst the tombstones, I found about a dozen graves of Confederate soldiers. Mr. Taylor visited and I took him to the site. I don't know what's in the book, but we saw nothing spooky. But when I went back myself that night, I saw reddish ""lamps"" moving around, emanating from quivering fog-like forms -- which were translucent and seemed to glow in the moonlight. This accouht may be in another one of Mr. Taylor's excellent studies, but it happened. I was the man. I was there. I saw them."
4,Insightful!,"Stephan Schiffman's short to-the-point book features his new Prospect Management System, which is designed to help you become a more effective salesperson. This hearty addition to sales literature shows you how to be more systematic as you generate prospects and devote your attention to the ones who are most likely to buy. Instead of just playing a numbers game, Schiffman emphasizes ratios, so you can zero in on your best clients while developing new prospects - since only a few leads become sales. The book's charts and examples illustrate its principles, although the quizzes after each chapter seem unnecessary. If we were hawking this book, we from getAbstract would pitch it to those who sell big ticket items by developing leads through cold-calling."
1,Completely ineffective,"Did not work at all for me, so much algae grew I had to drain the fountain and use a pressure washer to blast all the algae off. Sludge was terrible. It looked like I had used nothing. Cleaned the fountain and tried again with the same results. Now I know why they were selling it on the clearance table at the nursery."
4,"Good, almos great","He is beyond the shadow of a doubt one of the most promising names of world class guitar playing, and I recommend him to any guitar player or anyone with simply good taste. The CD itslef is good however it was recorded with limited funds given by a prize won by Yamandu. Because of the financial limitations, you do encounter a few cuts that seem to have been recorded in a hurry. In other words, the performes are great but the studio work is what takes that fifth missing star on he rating of this product. Good, almost great!"
5,Wonderful Book!,"As a member of the 18-35 generation, I found Mitchell's book to be an excellent reminder of all the good things young people can do in politics. The different ""snapshots"" of individuals around the country were enjoyable, varied, and insightful. I am so motivated to take a more active role in government now! I read this book in one night and felt it was an evening well spent."
5,A totally worthwhile read,"I really liked the pace of this book. Frankly, I have little time to read, and this book has been one of the few to hold my interest. Anyone who thinks all poli sci books are supposed to be as thick as doorstops wouldn't like this one, but I suspect those readers aren't the author's target, anyway."
4,Politics Catches Up!,"I laughed when I read the review below. Nothing like a senseless diatribe to get me to write one of these things! First of all, the reviewer seems to be one of the overweening self-proclaimed genius-types that really would hate this book, mostly because THEY DON'T GET IT! Michelle's point wasn't that we're like everyone else. When she wrote this, no one thought we lacked party affiliation and our volunteerism rates hadn't been written about. She was the first. Now this guy posts a sneering review about this being the worst book he's ever read? Try accurate, pal! Try ahead of it's time. But then, he probably wouldn't realize this. Old guard political types wouldn't."
3,The work deserves neither the credit nor the harsh criticism,"Mitchell does deserve credit for being one of the few authors willing to rebut some of the stereotypes that surround ""generation X."" However, the work is clearly not as comprehensive as some proclaim it to be.The specific ""case studies"" Mitchell uses are not fully explored and in many cases it seems as if significant detail has been left out. By virtue of her experience in D.C. Mitchell's contacts and experiences are not that of the typical member of this generation.This book is certainly an easy to read and innovative work. Hopefully it will encourage other authors to follow her lead and dispel the gen X stereotypes with more conclusive evidence."
4,"Recent events only prove the ""18-35"" vote matters.","I recently finished this book, and being from this generation I touched base with many of the book's topics. If anyone has an interest in the future of politics one only needs to read this book. In light of the recent elections, one can easliy see that the ""18-35"" vote can make or break an election."
1,A New Kind of Rubbish,"This book proves the fact that just because you have a good eye and a good idea, doesn't mean you can translate it into a good book. There has been quite a bit of buzz in DC about this book, but closer inspection of the text shows that rather than a ""road map"" to the future political landscape, Mitchell provides a sketch on the back of a dirty cocktail napkin. Read the dust cover and skip the book, because there's nothing new inside and the inside flap is much better writing."
5,An eye-popping genre of an American Political future,"Ms. Mitchell walks you effortlessly through the seemingly endless tide of statistics and baby ""booming"" attitudes. She takes you out of the endless ""spin"" cycle by putting you inside the people running politics. She pummels assumed realities of the changing nature of generation-politics; bouncing from Capital Hill to the political evolution and involvement of young Americans; Mitchell convincingly shows the congruence of political thinking of 18-35ers. Her insiders view provides what could be the critical link to ending the political misunderstanding between the US and THEM of now separated political generations. This is a must for an early Xmas gift for your favorite politician."
1,Smells Like Yesterday,"If this is the future then I'm selling my stocks. The writing was almost unreadable, and somehow the material already seems dated (how often have you heard Generation X spoken of as a block lately-- like some roped off herd). If the book itself is a standout for our generation, we really will settle for less."
1,"Pass the Smoke and Mirrors, Please","I despised this book. I felt it displayed two distinct and unhealthy tendencies: making what used to be called ""good citizenship"" seem a major innovation on the part of 18-to-35 year old ""Gen X-ers,"" and betraying an almost pathological hatred of older Baby Boomers. (Hey lady, we didn't ask to be born in record numbers!) Along with that goes a prose style that is ""loopy"" in both the literal and slang senses of the word: it buzzes round and round topics without really getting into them, and it employs too much slam-bang hyperbole.My advice to the author: CALM DOWN and realize that the metaphors you learned in video production don't automatically transfer to the printed page. You keep telling us and telling us that your generation has plenty to say, and I'm sure it does, but if it says so in print it will have to say so in a linear, sequential fashion. Where is Jedediah Purdy when you need him?"
5,"Fails to Disappoint! Still Going Strong, Levellers Deliver!","Sure, they're a bit more mature, and that youthful angst they so beautifully put forth in their beginning albums has faded, but that angst can truly only belong to the young anyway. ""Truth and Lies"" still has the edginess and the depth of their previous albums.The funny thing about this band is how well they age. The albums that disappointed me (Levellers, Zeitgeist and Hello Pig) are now played as much as any of the albums I loved immediately.This one I loved immediately. It's melodic, interesting, and flows quite nicely. The violin hook in the first song is quite catchy and the song ""For Us All"" sticks in the head hours after you've heard it.Overall, great album, and if you enjoyed ""Green Blade Rising"" you will enjoy this one."
3,"11 EXCELLENT TRACKS, POOR SOUND QUALITY","THE RECORDING OF THIS PRODUCTION WAS POORLY DONE, AND RUINS ANY CHANCE OF THIS BEING A GOOD ALBUM. I THINK THAT THE SONGS WERE MIXED AND PRODUCED IN A GARAGE. IT'S A SHAME, BECAUSE THE SONGS ARE VERY GOOD, SPECIALLY, ""LAST MAN ALIVE"" THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM SINCE ""LEVELLING THE LAND"""
5,"Again, where was I -stuck listening to Metallica! stupid me...","I know I'm repeating myself, but these guys are great: they deserved more exposure and were surely better than the Met-boys (after Burton passed- RIP) -great arrangements and songwriting and terrific guitar work!!"
4,their best cd if the bass player could sing at all.,"technically the most intense music to come from the swiss ever and they're not neutral but dominantly heavy.the guitarist would eventually resurface again in kreator in later years.this band had so much talent and drive but i think they never go enough chance to show it all.they seemed to be sort of searching for a way out of their confort zone but still brutally vicious,heavy three piece band."
4,A group ahead of their time / Buy it!,"I bot this as a ""cut out"" cd for 2.00. Its funny how those end up being some of your favorite cd's. A very dark/speedy/intense metal album. Its a cd that could be released today and still be very vital. I believe these guys were from Germany, had some success but broke up. You cant go wrong with any band that was on the NOISE label originally. If you like Celtic Frost, you'll love these guys."
4,"Entertaining ""Momentum""","Before Teri Hatcher got popular again in ""Desperate Housewives"", she starred in this paranormal thriller about criminals with supernatural abilities. The story and acting are very good for this kind of cable film and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Mr. Gossett is excellent as the bad guy. If you like movies like ""Scanners"", see this."
2,Thriller,"I bought this because Teri Hatcher and my favorite Grayson McCouch were both in the movie. I prefer to watch Louis Gossett as a nice guy. The acting was rather well done, but after all, they didn't have much of a plot with which to work. Probably a movie for the younger set, not something I would watch again."
2,"Nice idea, needs work","At first I was enamored by the way the smooth operation as the light opened up. But at the height of the neck, the beam was too small. And then the neck droops so that the small beam only lit up the top of the book so I was constantly adjusting the beam. Very frustrating. I found that if I held the light from about 10 inches above the book, the entire book was perfectly illuminated. But then you may as well be using a flashlight. You also have to remove the clip to open or close the light. Had the neck extended from the side away from the clip, then you wouldn't ever have to remove it as you read the book.I'm looking for a replacement..."
4,Great Light,This is a great item but it runs out of battery after 2-3 hours of reading. So as a teacher it is practical for my night use not waking up my wife.
3,good but now their finest hour,"This one is for the fans only; a good set of songs, but not nearly as wonderful as their finest albums (""At Yankee Stadium"" being my favorite). The band displays their usual fun and ferocious approach to music, but the songs on here are just a notch below their best material. What you have is mostly Terry Adams writing the songs, with Al Anderson relagated to guitar playing and getting co-writing credits on just 3 tunes. My favorite tracks are ""A Little Bit of Bad,"" ""Ramona"" and even the silly ""Spampinato."" NRBQ was a great band, both live in concert and in the studio, but I wouldn't recommend this one as the first purchase for someone wanting to hear what they sound like. Listen to the older 70s albums first."
1,Bad customer service and product quality,"I have bought this product several days ago, The product I mean the Ginseng size is huge difference with the photo they post one amazon.com, a lot of smaller when I receive the product. Then I contact to them, the customer service is really rude, and they didn't provide any reasonable solution."
2,Disappointing follow-up to Shepherd of the Hills.,"I dearly loved Shepherd of the Hills...so much so that I didn't want to put it down, & when it was over, I wanted to continue being involved in the characters' lives. I'm having trouble not only following the characters in this book, but even staying awake enough to get involved. I'm sure it's a good story, but the delivery is not nearly as engaging as it's predecessor was with it's use of Ozark mountain dialect."
1,Cheap lug nuts rust & break within 1 years,"Steer away from these company, they used to sell good quality lock nuts as I ordered a set from them and after 1 year the all bolts is rusted, another six months later when I try to removed the bolts to change my brake pads the security key teeth strip with the inner welding got busted. Call McGard they ask for receipt for warranty so my luck ran out and had to purchased a replacement key plus shipping total of $30. After six months one of the bolt inner welding broke so I had to use an oversize socket to loosing it, after all 4 McGard bolts came off my car I was relieve and quickly use the OEM bolts came with my car.Save yourself time and money don't buy this JUNK."
2,Does not fit my 2013 Dodge Journey,I liked this product but it did not fit my new 2013 Dodge Journey. Returning and going to search out for one that fits
4,Great looking earrings,"Earrings look good, very sparkly. Wish they had lever backs instead of french wires. Otherwise they are perfect! Can be worn dressy or casual."
3,It's OK...,"I bought these for my birthday last year and I wasn't too thrilled to wear them. The crystals are larger than I had imagined. They are also coated with a layer of something that enhanced the coloring. I gave them to my sister-in-law instead. They were EXTREMELY sparkling under the sun light. I thought it attracted too much attention, but you might like them..."
5,Hold on to your head!,"The wicket ish will never die! They done did it again! NATAS best album is DO-U-BELIEVE-N-GOD, this is the second best. This album is better than Esham- Mail Dominance. The best songs are ""FOOTBALL""- that song is got the most..... I don't know how to say it, but the beat is unbelivable! Then ""Like a Spirit"" is awesome too! There is like 2 songs that are weak, but the rest of the album is out cha atmosphere! If you know anything bout RLP, ESHAM or NATAS, then you should know you need this album!!!! (NATAS is Esham, T-N-T, Mastamind)"
5,Slept on for far to long,"I heard about this CD through Murder Dog (an underground West Coast Rap Mag) they ranked this CD as the #1 CD of the year so of course I had to buy it. At first I thought they were some rock/rap group and kind of didn't like. My boy hated it because of the heavy rock inlfuence, ironicly he is now one of the biggest Esham and Natas fans I have met, even more than me. The CD grows on you and after 5-6 years, I pop this CD in and it brings back all kinds of memories and I know every lyric to every song on here. This CD got me onto Esham and from then on, I can't put his stuff down. The bottom line, this CD is not for everyone and if you don't like it at first, it grows on you, just like all of Eshams stuff. A must have for any hip hop head but a word of warning to you candy bar, radio hip hop heads, this right here is nothing you never heard before. Keep an open ear and an open mind, the best group CD I've heard."
3,"Macho, Shoot-em Up Gore","Young adult fare, written at the elementary school level. Product arrived in a timely manner, as advertised. Macho, shoot-em up, gore."
1,Terrible,"I got this on a whim, never heard of them, now I know why, they suck, really truely suck. Sorry guy's, but it's true."
2,A classic? Hardly.,"This is amateurish proto-punk at it's party-oriented height. There is no message, there is no rebellion, there is nothing new brought to the table. It's just sloppy, pop-oriented, aggressive rock music. No one cared about the Dictators back then, and few should bother now. If ""funny"" (and I use that term loosely) meatheaded, party rock is your thing, then by all means go for it. However, if you're looking for ""classic"" punk rock, please search elsewhere, as this is the furthest thing from a ""must-buy"" as I can think of right now."
4,"Indeed, ahead of their time! Too early for Spinal Tap!","I first read about the Dictators in a book titled ""The new Rocknroll"" back in 1984, but unfortunately, no one in the surrounding music stores ever heard about them.Years later, in 1995, I have spotted a copy of this CD at a bargain price, and immediately bought it.In addition to all other positive reviews on this page, I would only like to add that, if you liked Spinal Tap, this album should also be considered, if not a must."
5,If you like punk music...,This is a surprisingly good early album in the punk scene. It's feel-good punk that doesn't bother about with politics or conflict... it's for guys who like beer... wrestling and monster cars. Excellent! I recommend it... give it a couple of listens because it grows on you.
4,get it while you can!,Now that major labels are deleting catalog and doing digital-only reissues you better get this pronto if you don't already have it. It's a stone classic.Also check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
4,"great, but not my fave","How could you not pick up a CD/LP (in my time) with a pix of some goofball in a singlet and a glitter jacket in the background sporting the name Handsome Dick Manitoba?!? Curiosity is the crux of R & R and this was for the good.The tunes are timeless--Next Big Thing, 2 Tub Man,....They Rock And They're funny.C'mon--talking about White Castle, Vitamin C, ""ralphing"", gasoline shortage, fat chicks....They wrote songs that every schlub could identify with.My only 'problem' is in the production---too overdubbed in the sense of the rhythm tracks are down and then BOOM all of a sudden a lead guitar comes from nowhere and blasts the song to death.I love this LP but not as much as 'Manifest Destiny' which a lot of people rate as weak."
1,Worst book ever,most boring book of all time. Text book X2 without the pictures or graphs. Restates ideas X5. Takes for ever to read
1,So glad I'm done!,"This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read. It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER! I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death. I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days. I liked the last chapter... because it was the last."
1,"Why, oh why?","I wanted to like this book. I loved some of the characters, at least, at first. And I realize it's not a textbook, but really? Opinions stated as fact? Doesn't seem very Pulitzer-worthy to me. Now, I'm no author, much less one who has gotten a Pulitzer prize, but Ellis makes quite a few logical leaps, like a previously stated quote from the last chapter from Thomas Jefferson. I hold very little respect for my IB History of the Americas teacher who assigned this, and much less respect for Mr. Ellis himself.Sorry, but at least I finished it, right?"
2,Slow read,This book appears to be written for academia and peers. The author includes many quotes from the revolutionary period and his own narrative smacks of the old English used during that era with the effect being that you feel mired in language and ornate wording rather than entertained by history.
2,Tedious Overanalysis,"The events portrayed in this book were undoubtedly of tantamount importance to the formation of our government by the founders, butI doubt the founders themselves could have slogged through this tedious, overanalytic account of their actions. The author's ability to stretch the story beyond all human endurance to read it and stay interested is phenomenal. I hung on through chapter two, the end of at which point I realized that there are much better history books out there that are worth spending your time on. Read Mccullough's John Adams instead, it's well worth the effort."
4,Great Book,"This book is an excellent book. It is a series of little stories about the founding fathers. Most of the stories occur during the constitutional convention. The author definitely did his research. He found things that are not found in other books. For example the author writes about how the Quakers and Ben Franklin tried to introduce a resolution in the first congress to outlaw slavery. The author also highlights the divisions that did exist in this country and were not really solved until the civil war. If you want to view the founding fathers in a new light, like real people you should read this book."
4,one of the best nonfiction books I've read,"This is a very entertaining and enlightened look at early American History. Going into this all I knew were the vague memories left over from basic history classes in high school and college. Yet this book was very accessible and easy to read. This is the best scholarly type writing I have run across. It is crisp, to the point, and frequently funny. Absent is the pretentiousness of other scholarly writers who attempt to put out a work for the layman. But the true gem is in what Ellis decides is important to tell. He gives you real insight into the people by providing interesting details into their personal lives and characters. This is a nice job from start to finish and I recommend it for anyone who has any tiny interest in American History."
4,History in Human Terms,"This book really humanizes the founders! The stories go deep into their beliefs, their personalities, and their alliances and conflicts. We almost didn't make it past those early days -- these are the individuals who led us through this remarkable experiment."
4,Good Read.,Good read and good insight as to the ideas and personalities of some of our early leaders. I enjoyed it.
5,Great,This book really introduces you to the personalities of the founding fathers. Washington and Adams come off looking pretty good. Jefferson comes off a little duplicitious.Much recommended!
4,Founding Bros,"Very insightful. I came away from reading this book with a clearer understanding of the conflicts and philosophies of government of the founding generation. Also, I now have a much greater feel for the character and human dimension of the generation that led us through the revolution and early republic years of the 1790's. Must reading for anyone whose knowledge of the period is confined to survey courses in Amer Hist in high school or college."
4,Compelling and Enlightening,"This book provides a compelling and enlightening account of six of the major controversies, incidents, and relationships faced by the newborn United States during the 1790s. The stories are self contained, so they're easy to pick up and set down. But together they combine to provide an excellent sense of the atmosphere, culture, and characters of the early Republic. Ellis takes our founding fathers--or brothers--off their pedestals, which makes them all the more interesting and renders their accomplishments as a group all the more impressive. An excellent book."
4,A Vote For Abigail,"FOUNDING BROTHERS is a highly readable book about the major movers and shakers of the revolutionary generation. It is arranged around interesting topics such as the great compromise of 1790 and the enduring friendship of Adams and Jefferson. Ellis seems to believe that the most underrated person of the generation may be Abigail Adams. As the most overrated character Ellis probably favors Benjamin Franklin. Aaron Burr easily wins the distinction as the most despised member of the brotherhood. I recommend the book as a provocative reading experience, especially if the subject is new to you."
2,Well...,"I don't mind history rewritten as opinion as long as 1)It's acknowledged at the beginning and 2) it's cleverly written. This misses the mark on both. I had to struggle to make it though and to be honest, I'm not better for it on the other side.Take a pass on this for the most part. However, the section of the Hamilton Duel is well written and it's the only part(aside from a few sections on John and Abigail), that I recommend reading."
5,intellectually stimulating,"Founding Brothers is a well-written and engaging account of the relationship of the founding fathers (and mother) of the United States. While it takes the form of a group of stories that involve the founding fathers, many of them overlap and they all give a detailed explanation of the history of each person and the situation in which each story takes place. For a person who has read extensively on early American history, this book ranks among the top of the list of books on this subject. It is not only a great description and analysis of the events of the birth and early years of this country, but also an exploration of many facts about the founding fathers that most people are not aware of."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"Without re-hashing all the subjects that have already been covered here, allow me to add that I enjoyed the book. Often books that deal with politics and personalities are either boring or slanted to fit an agenda. The author managed to write a well crafted story that entertains at the same time it informs."
3,Good Drama / Good Read,"This book read like a fine wine compared to many history books out there. Too much time has been spent in the past 10 years bashing the founding fathers, and this book provides a far more balanced approach to the time period, and their accomplishments. The analysis of the the brains, and hearts of these founding brothers is done with skill by Ellis, and that is what history is about, figuring out what happened with whatever evidence is available at the time. For those who would dwell on the controversy surrounding Ellis, I would say, the work is still good regardless of the man and his ethics. The book talks about the fact truth can be relative depending on perspective, and that is history. So this book gets three stars, and is worth reading.Joseph Dworak"
3,Good overview of the revolutionary personalities,"I liked the John Adams book better, but this was a good overview of the people and issues of the time, and how they related to each other.I tend to like more depth than breadth, and this was a broad brush. But competently done and interestingly told."
4,Human beings after all,"In Joseph J. Ellis' Founding Brothers we see the men who are considered the ""Founding Fathers"" as they really were, men, not the infallible heroes of American history text books. By showing how these men reacted to events in their lives and their interactions with one another, Ellis shows the reader fallible men, with too much pride and envy, who despite these faults helped form America. Events such as Washington's Farewell and the choice of Washington D.C. for the capital are discussed in detail and give the reader insight into the politics and personalities of the times. Despite having to work through the very wordy preface and one more re-telling of the Burr-Hamilton duel that really adds nothing to the book, this book is a highly informative look at the early history of the U.S.A."
4,a good read,"This is a great book and very informative for the length. It does get a little wordy at times, but still one for the history buff."
3,Going Against the Grain,"Despite all the glowing remarks here, I find Ellis to be a tedious author and there's nothing that bothers me more than a writer who kills a good story.This strikes me as a vehicle designed to showcase the author's ease with highly constructed language and put forth his own research as the screen through which we are to view these men. Rather like trying to see a fantastic painting through an elaborate screen. All you want to do is push it out of the way so you can get a good look at it."
5,A typical reader,I am not a person who typically reads books about politics or government. I do like to read about history and found this book a good read.
5,Wonderful history lesson,"This is a wonderful book about the American Revolutionary period - especially for those who are not interested in every (dry) scholarly detail. Unlike many historical volumes, the information is accessible to the more casual reader.Perhaps the best part of this book is that the historical figures are shown to be real people. The effects of personality, personal values and relationships are made evident. Because of Ellis' chosen point of view, a fuller view of the events and people of that era is presented. Highly recommended. A fast read."
1,If you like +200 pages of opinion and gobblydegook with little substantial evidence...,"Founding Brothers is just some guy's commentary regarding certain debatable events following the Revolution.Whatever. If you weed out his opinions and all the extraneous detail (like what type of fabric a certain person's petticoat is made of, or how many clouds were in the sky, hell I don't really remember) the book would be about 20 pages of useful information. He dances around the subject like he's trying to be Michael Jackson.This is not a biased review. I love learning about history.Don't miscategorize this book as being historical.But then again I am only seventeen. What do I know? This review can be argued with. I have little substantial evidence. This is just my opinion."
2,Dull and repetitive,"Reading this book is like listening to an irate woman go off on you. The narrative keeps coming back to the same point over and over and over.Here's an example to illustrate what reading this book is like: While introducing an account to the duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, Ellis makes the point that a brief telling of the story would not convey all of its details or historical significance.Note that I just made that point in one sentence.Ellis requires several long, meandering sentences involving an actual example of a hypothetical brief account, merely to announce that he is about to offer a longer account of the duel. What a deplorable lack of compassion for the reader, not to mention a cruel waste of ink and trees. Just get to the point, I say. Also, who does Ellis imagine needs to be told that a short description of an event contains less information than a longer description?"
3,Would have been more enjoyable if it had more direction,"AUthor goes through tying in the lives of the founding fathers. Talked of Burr and Hamilton Duel, Adams and Jefferson's friendship and various things like that. Interesting to get the view of the founding fathers on slavery which inevitably lead to the civil war. Interesting to see their conclusions on the issue Either I missed something or it seemed like this book had little direction. I could never quite get the author's point. I am an avid reader of history books and this one seemed more boring than most. I wanted to like it but oculdn't quite"
3,Good book-Too much information,"Founding Brothers is an excellent book by Joseph J. Ellis. He describes, in his opinion, the six most important events of the revolutionary era. He calls them the Duel, Dinner, Silence, Farewell, Collaborators, and Friendship. Though how historically accurate Ellis is, the book gets really boring at times. If you are a history buff, you will love it. Me, I enjoy reading about history, but this book was a little too much. It took me what seemed like forever to finish this book, and I skipped a lot. First, let me tell you that you will need a dictionary when reading this book. Second, Ellis has a style in which he keeps on going and going on one topic. This is the part that historians and history buffs love, but the average person gets bored out of his mind. The chapter I enjoyed the most were the Duel, Silence, and Farewell. The rest were alright, but Ellis does not know when to quit. Overall, pick it up from a library and voice your own opinion."
1,"Dull, Dull, Dreadfully Dull",It's like Monty Python once said.He never uses one succinct sentence when 25 repetitive ones will do. He blah-blahs on so long that we have forgotten what on earth he was talking about by the time he gets to the end of his harangue two pages later. He evens make the Burr-Hamilton duel dull. It's ghastly.
3,"Short, well written, but a bit biased","This book is a quick read for someone interested in the Founding Fathers who doesn't want to invest in 800 pages. But i have to agree with some of the other reviews concerning bias. There is a notable bias towards Adams, that start to grate on your nerves, and I think it stems from the current political trend toward collectivism and against individualism. That being said, it was still interesting I would recommend the as long as going into it people understand the bias."
3,"A quick, entertaining read, however, not deep in perspective","Ellis concentrates his emphasis on seminal events during the early formation of our country and government. A great deal of the book, however, focuses on previous material on the relationship between Adams and Jefferson. In addition, the first chapter on the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton is left out of place with no further context outlined later in the book. Certain founding brothers such as Franklin and Burr are not dealt with in any great detail. The chapter on Washington's Farewell Address was the best vignette in the book."
2,it just keeps going.....,"I had to read this book for summer reading but i was still some what excited to read it. I was extremely disappointed. Ellis is an awful writer. He uses the same words and phrases over and over making the book even more tedious and boring. He never stays on topic adn manages to take every interesting point in the book and drag it out to the point that any interest he manages to spark is gone.Although the book does cover the ""founding brothers"" well it's just written poorly. Honestly i did learn things but im sure if I picked up another book out there covering similiar material, it would be presented in a more interesting and less rambling way. Anything would be better than this book. It took me an entire weekend just to get through one of the chapters, the book is that tedious.I dont suggest this book at all unless you are extremely interested in the topic and can manage to get over the horrible way it is written."
2,Founding Brothers,"When I was in Junior and Senior High School over 60 years ago we did not have only one specific history text book for each class because the teachers taught ""History, as written, depends on the bias of the writer."". We were required to read books by several different authors. In reading Professor Ellis's ""Founding Brothers"", I sensed he has a bias against, and a dislike for, Tom Jefferson and the Republican Party. Then I learned the Professor also lied to his students about his ""combat experience in Vietnam""."
3,"Great approach, fair presentation","I loved the selection of stories that Mr. Ellis uses to depict the origins of this country. After I finished the book I could not help but feel like he had assumed more creative license than fact. Some of the interpretations he presented could not be reconciled. This is most evident in the way he translated some correspondence between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. I read ""American Sphinx"" and would never have thought the author of that book was the same as the author of this book. Founding Brothers is a good read, but a little frustrating at times."
3,The Founding Fathers By Way Of Spinal Tap,"Founding Brothers casts the Revolutionary Generation as members of a wacky movie:Jefferson is a scheming image-concious politicianAdams a motor-mouth drama kingMadison the ultimate cold-eyed master parlimentarian, andHamilton is a euphoric personality who wants to conquer the world.This is an educational, and fun read."
1,I absolutly hated this book.,This book came to me in outstanding condition but it was an awful read and I would have nevered paid what I did if I knew how awful the book was.
5,Great,"Extremely well written. The book focuses on 6 major events during the formative years and tries to give the reader the ""behind the scenes"" view of each situation. Really gives a unseen insight into these people. You'll be susprised at who did what and why. The writting is great and I always recommend books by this author since his writting style is smoot and easily digested. Just a great book."
3,Some Good Insights,"Good insights into the lives of Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. Without the recommendation of my son, I never would have gotten through the first chapter. If you can survive the author's lengthy explanation of why he wrote this book, the rest is much more readable. The final chapters, which delve into complex relationship between Adams and Jefferson, are the best part of the book. While most of this story is well known, Joseph Ellis brings out nuances of their relationship by reprinting excerpts from their private letters. That alone makes it worth the read."
4,Good History,"Founding Brothers presented the revolutionary generation not only studiously but personally. Joseh Ellis gives an individual feel to the presidents who formed our nation in language beautiful and precise. He did, however, go back and forth in time, which makes the following of events somewhat abstruse. This book is a good complement to wider studies in American history. - Shery Gripman, Author"
4,A very educational and entertaining book,"Joseph Ellis has taken a different approach with America's revered saints. Instead of discussing them one at a time, he examines their relationships with each other, and shows how those personal relationships effected pivotal situations in American History.There's a long chapter on the complicated relationship between Jefferson and Adams through the years. There is also a great chapter on the Hamilton/Burr Duel, the events leading up to it, and the best guess scenario of what really happened at the shooting. But my favorite story is a dinner meeting at Thomas Jefferson's house in which Alexander Hamilton and James Madison come to a compromise that would eventually put the nation's capital on the Potomac River.The book is full of short yet thorough tales. The stories seem to leave out the unnecessary and highlight the consequential. Ellis, gets a great deal of information into this short history book."
1,A hash job,"Ellis makes it clear from the start where his sympathies lie with the Revolutionary generation and he ambushes us with Abigail Adams for good measure. Of the six stories, only The Silence is revealing for Ellis' feeble attempt to portray the slavery debate as a South-against-South issue. He lavishes attention on a hillbilly from Georgia simply to whitewash a Virginian like Jefferson, who in fact held the same, if not worse, attitudes about his slaves (all conveniently ignored by Ellis). Hamilton was the closest as any of these founding brothers came to believing that blacks and whites were equal and his financial system doomed slavery in a way Adams and his fine rhetoric could never hope to, but he barely rates a mention."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"After reading ""John Adams"", I was sure that I was going to love a book discussing some of the figures that interacted in Adams' life.The book patently misrepresents a key fact concerning one of the subjects and was the point that I decided to stop trying to give the book a chance.What I found was a superficial treatment that just lightly glosses over the main characters in the drama of the American Revolution.I recognize volumes can be written about the Revolution that never even scratch the surface, but this was ridiculous.Please don't waste your time with this."
2,"Well-researched, but impossibly longwinded","I found the author's insight to be well researched and fascinated. In fact, my fascination with his topics was exceeded only but the author's fascination with his vocabulary."
3,Unconventional but worth persevering,"If you want a conventional biography of the founding fathers, then this isn't the book for you. It certainly presumes that you're American and learned a lot about the subjects at school. But, if you're interested in personalities and how they work together & against each other, then this is probably one of the best books to deal with these characters who struggled through some interesting times."
5,History at it's best!,"This is no ordinary history book. It's a great book about the ""Founding Brothers."" This book will take you in the room where the discussions were held. It makes you feel as if you are there in the midst of history happening. You get to know these individuals as people, not just icons of history. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. Takes you back to the moment. A terrific book. Joseph Ellis brings history to life once again."
2,Pretentious,"I only read after starting this book that Ellis lied about having served in Vietnam. But just from the tone of the book, I'm not surprised he lied about having been in combat. The tone of the book is so POMPOUS and PRETENTIOUS and AFFECTED and the writing so FLORID. Ellis is obviously a showboat. If he's so grand in his writing, I can see how he would be grand as a person, to the point of lying about military service to puff his image up. That this book won the Pulitzer Prize is nauseating. Michael Chabon's novel ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" won the Pultizer Prize for best novel, and it's a pompous, pretentious, affected, contrived, florid piece of gooey pap. The Pulitzer judges must love phonines and contrived writing. I think I'll steer clear of the books they vote for from here on out."
4,Interesting but a tad too dramatic,"Mr. Ellis has a fantastic way of delivering history. I find this book to be well organized and although I'm not a historian it appears to be well researched. There were a lot of historical points that I was unaware of such as the way our founding fathers disliked: political parties, campaigning, the aristocracy of Europe, and organized religion. There seems a little too much embellishment in the delivery of the story but overall this is a wonderful book."
3,"okay, hard to read",Ellis is a very scholarly gentleman but his scholarly side came out in this book as it was very difficult to read. I found it very interesting him talking about things in history I had never thought about but he assumed we knew all about this pivotal points in American History and I did not.We read this for a book club and there is also a video that goes with it the Founding Brothers that the History channel did.
4,School Book Report,"I needed to get a book(from a selected list) to read and write a report for a class. I didn't want to spend that much money and buy a brand new book from the book store, so I looked on here to see if I could find one. When I recieved it, I was expecting it to be maybe a little torn up and ratty. But I was pleasently suprised that it looked brand new...and it was like half the price than one at a book store! So I will definatley use Amazon again for when I need to purchase books."
5,"well written, informative","Founding Brothers is written with eloquence, wit, and learning -- so much learning that the author assumes we all know the ins and outs of the XYZ Affair or the Whiskey Rebellion, without being reminded.Okay, well, anyone who chooses this book to read can look those up elsewhere. A more serious problem is the title, which challenges a familiar perception, that of the Founding Fathers. If radically changing those fathers into brothers, Ellis should have meticulously elucidated his reasons for that change (if it ain't broke, don't fix it). Instead, all we get are a few scattered references to a band of brothers. Indeed, Ellis himself calls these leaders patriarchs. So why bother?"
2,Suffocating,"While filled with interesting details, and factual opinions, Founding Brothers was a difficult read. Keep a Dictionary by you for this book! While descriptive (what some may call ""big"" words) are always a good idea, when strung together in a sentence that turns out to be the entire paragraph, and with little use of punctuation, they can be very hard to understand! Ellis definitely does not get an ""A"" for composition, but as far as content, he did a lot of research, and a good job overall. I definitely recommend it to U.S. history buffs who just can't get enough about the founders of this country. On the other hand, if you're looking for an interesting read, but don't want to have to read every sentence 20 times before you understand, I suggest trying a different book. It got 2 stars because of the difficulty encountered in reading."
2,"Good points, yet it bored me to tears...","on average, i read about 12 pages per hour...which isnt very good for me because i am normally a very fast reader. the preface was a very horrile opening to the book because it wasnt interesting enough to excite the reader, even if they are very interested in this subject, like myself. once i got to the main chapters, i was a little more hopeful to read about some of the events that may have went on during our countries early beginning. i found that the author made very interesting points, yet his writing style was very tedious and extrememly hard to follow. he used run on sentences, repeated phrases,and got off topic. i must have read over the same sentences at least 4 times. in addition, i thought he over-analyzed some things. yet, if you are a historian who is very interested in this topic, then i would recommend it, otherwise, spare your self the time and effort that it takes to read this book."
4,"Some things they foresaw, some they didn't","This is a great account of how a few episodes shaped our country soon after 1776. The real work began after the British left. The issue of slavery tabled to ensure that the Northern and Southern states could at least agree to a federal government. An amazing account of gentlemen who had no idea what would become of their ""country"". The most fascinating part is the Adams-Jefferson friendship/feud/friendship of 2 very different political ideals."
5,History taught as it should,"Ellis deviates from the normal revisionist viewpoint so common in our modern day history books--HE TELLS THE TRUTH. More importantly he does so in such a unique way that the reader hates putting the book down. Mr. Ellis so vividly recreates the stage for his players that the reader feels Mr. Adams, Jefferson, Washington and Hamilton are there sharing the moment. Never have I read history where the facts were so evenly portrayed. We need more books like this.No doubt Mr. Ellis will be criticized by his contemporaries for trying to resurrect the ""dead white male"" heroes of our great country.Jeffersonian zealots (truth be told, I was one of them) beware as Mr. Ellis makes a verying compelling case for Mr. Adams as the true pioneer of freedom despite Mr. Jefferson's sometimes duplicitious actions to the contrary.In short, I loved this book."
4,A Fine Introduction to the Founding of the Republic,"Joseph Ellis has written a fine intro to the fascinating history of 1790's America. He focuses on some of the most important topics of the day such as slavery, federalism, and regionalism, problems that give rise to conflict even today. He places a heavy emphasis on the significance of the ""brothers'"" interpersonal relationships in the success of the Constitution and the American republic. Overall, it is very readable, although he occasionally lets his sentences run on for one too many lines. As other reviewers have mentioned, Ellis at times attempts to probe the inner lives and motives of the fathers, which are quite obviously open to interpretation. That aside, FOUNDING BROTHERS is an enjoyable and enlightening read for anyone interested in the formation of our great nation, and the men who made it possible."
5,History Revisited,"I am enjoying Audio Books in my car as I go from here to there in L.A. This nice long view of eight of our founders, their lives and motivations, and actual historical happenings, has been a revelation. The narrator has a pleasing speaking voice, and the eighteenth century comes alive on the freeways! I recommend this to anyone who loves history dressed up in the personal lives of its inhabitants."
5,A great insite to history,"This is a practical analysis of the things that had to be done by the people who had to do them when the United States was born. It showed to me that while law, regulation, theory, and skill were and continue to be very important to government, the force of personality, understanding of politics, and above all leadership were the most important requirements which put this country on a solid footing. The author does this through the interaction of personalities, showing weaknesses as well as strengths. His viewpoints are not unbiased, but he gives reasons for his preferences. Could it happen again? I guess only the requirements of LEADERSHIP in the future will tell.This is a wonderful book, full of insight, personality and a delight for the amateur historian."
4,"A difficult read, but rewarding if you can manage through it","Ellis's book Founding Brothers is by no means an easy read. The language is sophisticated and his style of writing is very unique, almost poetic. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of the well known revolutionaries, this book is amazing. The author elaborately describes a few key events in the U.S.'s history to thoroughly explain the whole era. If you can get through the long strings of difficult vocabulary and sometimes confusing metaphors, I would highly recommend this book for a greater account of the events that made our country what it is today."
3,A Little too Imaginative........,"Due to the exceptional writing skills of the author, I didn't stop enjoying this book until the latter part of it.I can appreciate a degree of imagination thrown in to what can be excruciatingly dry history, but the author went well beyond what seemed proper. He threw so much of himself into the chapter titled ""The Friendship"" that came off as wreckless.....and ruined what was otherwise an excellent book."
4,Founding Brothers,A most interesting detailed account of the age that made our nation. Mr.Ellis shows us that all things are more complex than what they normally appear.
4,An easy to read book--engaging history,"This book is a treat for historians, history buffs, and people looking for light reading alike. I'm sure you may have heard some of the controversey surrounding Joe Ellis' false claims of service in Vietnam. Despite this deception, his work in this book is beyond reproach. Do not be discouraged by anything you might have heard, this is an accurate and engaging piece of historical commentary. The stories are rarely discussed, yet so important to American History. Ellis' analysis of the personalities of the American Founding Brothers are so interesting and insightful, you'll be enchanted from page one. My favorite chapter is the first, which discusses the fateful duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. It is a must read, even if your not a history buff!"
4,Founding Fathers,"Joseph Ellis has done a remarkable job at the condensing of, and granting expression to, the seven most influential men of the 1790's. The last two chapters, concerning largely the Adams Jefferson relationship are the strongest points of the book from two standpoints; granting life to the two icons, and excellent sholarly research. It's ease of reading allows the reader to gain insights into the personalities, and their corresponding idealogies, that shaped the emerging American ethic. This is a good combination of philosophical underpinnings, and humanity, that benefit anyone concerned with this critical period of American History. Thank you Mr. Ellis"
5,A tasteful look into each of those fascinating men,"In the afterglow of the HBO series on John Adams, I grew interested in some of the founding fathers, many of whom had seemed boring to me ever since I read their bios in grade school. Ellis does a highly intelligent and readable job of laying out the personalities, conflicts and battles of the whole group during the first years of the nation. I particularly like the chapter on the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton. Also great is the chapter about George Washington, who had seemed a cardboard character to me until my interest was piqued by the TV series. Ellis is more than a little inclined to repeat himself in that particular way academics have, although his ruminations are likely to advance the story, although a bit wordily. That aside, this book is worth digging into by anyone who wants to know what those guys were really all about and who doesn't want to be told by some ideologue what to think about them."
1,bag quality is good description does not match,"i am not satisfied with this product it say 17""notebook fit in the bag but hard fit battery and charger so description doesnot match with picture shown in front of bag i am disappointed with this purchage"
3,Half a Great Album,"Disco never really sucked, anymore than the blues or country suck. A genre doesn't suck; there are just good and bad examples of each type of music. Nowhere is that more evident than on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Let's face it - this would not be one of the top-selling albums of all time were it not for a very hip advertising campaign (I can remember seeing the ads as a nine-year-old and thinking, ""Man, I gotta sneak in somehow and see that!""). The Bee Gees songs are really all this collection needed, and it would have been four or five star material. The Brothers Gibb have aged surprisingly well - but almost everything else on here is expendable, with the exception of the transcendant ""Disco Inferno"" by the Trampps - burn that mother down! Almost worth the price right there. A good album to have in the collection, if only as a snapshot of the culture at a certain time and place."
5,"Great soundtrack, great memories","Everytime I hear this album it brings back such fun memories. I was 18 when this movie and soundtrack came out, and I was newly arrived in Canada as a Nanny for 2 children. I used to hang out with other British Nannies and friends, and this was THE movie to see. Along with Star Wars, but to us, that was a 'guys' film. For us girls ""Saturday Night Fever"" was IT, and we saw it at least twice, and everyone bought the album as soon as it was released. I have since seen the movie, and it is funny how 'corny' it seems to me now, but back then, to kids, teens and young adults, it was everything. But the music is still great, and every party I go to, at least one song from this is played. It is still 'great stuff'."
4,SNF cd,"It's just fine - skips in a couple of places, but perhaps it's my car unit ...Was early and good price tho!"
3,"Excellent sound quality, good and bad tunes","Perhaps characteristic of a soundtrack album is the inclusion of material that doesn't really belong on a CD. Six of the tunes could have been excluded, leaving just the hits. Just one version of ""More than a Woman"" would have been enough. And the 11-minute version of ""Disco Inferno"" is too much.I ripped the songs by the Bee Gees, Yvonne Elliman, Walter Murphy, K.C. and the Sunshine Band, and the Trammps. Using a computer program, I cut down the length of several tunes.The sound quality is excellent. I'm referring to the CD numbered P2 25389."
4,Catch the Fever~,"This is my all-time favorite soundtrack album!The disco beat will have you up on your feet in not time.Great Bee Gees soungs form the bulk of the tracks on it-from fast songs like ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Night Fever""to soft ballads like""How Deep is Your Love?"" the Brothers shine like a disco ball!This is a must-have for any Bee Gees fan or disco lover,I love it for all the grat music,and so will you.So buy it and catch the fever It's to have-any day of the week!"
2,OVERRATED,"BASICALLY ITS OVERRATED. THE SONGS DONT FLOW AS THEY SHOULD DO.THE SONGS ARE LOVELY BUT THEY HAVE BEEN KILLED STONE DEAD BY HYPE.WE KNOW DAMN WELL THEY WRITE BRILLIANT ALBUMS, THEY DONT NEED TO PROVE IT!(THE FILM ISNT MUCH GOOD EITHER-WHERES THE PLOT?)BUY STAYIN ALIVE ALBUM INSTEAD-AT LEAST THEY WERENT FORCED TO DO THAT AND THE SONGS ARE BETTER TOO!"
1,These kids need to Retire!,"I have been a fan of this CD for many years. Unfortunately, when it was recorded on by them, it then became a piece of trash. This CD lacks character and comradely. There's the classic ""More than a Woman"" - Lets hope the four of them are more than a woman. Maybe four women? Who knows, lets just say this CD needs to be thrown out in the cold, trampled on by a high-rooling steemengine, and spit out again in the cold. My take on this CD is definately 1 star, which is more than they ever had. Sorry kiddies."
4,disco sucks,"For my review, I'll reply to Melting Pot, who said ""I feel folk-rock from the 1960's was the bane of music.""Not only are you wildly incorrect, there exists one major diffrence between the Folk Rock and Disco. Folk Rock is gaining more and more YOUNG listeners. Same applies to all the music of the 60's. Disco on the other hands is getting NO new listeners.DISCO is a hokey, sequin and polyester strewn mess. At least Folk Rock musicians were genuine and were playing for love of the music(rather than love of the paycheck), and to make political changes.THE 1970's PRODUCED ONLY ONE GREAT MUSIC GENRE: FUNKinstead of the beegees, listen to War. They're 500 times better."
4,Saturday Night Fever,"The albumn is a glimpse in time with music that was hot about 18 months before the L.P's release, the BEE GEE's were not part of a cult movement known as disco that was the basis of the magazine article that was made into the movie.The L.P. introduced disco to the country and for that is it worth listening to.The instramental tracks are important since they were a part of the early disco scene when club DJ's looped 7"" records to make 5 and six minute dance songs.If you want to know how the Golden Age of disco (1977-1979) really sounded, buy this album."
2,Interesting at the Time,"While it was fun and interesting at the time, this only has appeal to those who lived through it for nostalgia purposes."
3,More than just Bee Gees,"On this soundtrack, the Bee Gees made disco palatable to a mass white audience with their massive hits. Their real novelty and talent is in their song writing and vocal harmonies much more than in the danceable grooves they employed but didn't pioneer. Nonetheless, there are still some fine pop songs of the time that work well with the film. For more compelling and adventurous disco-era fodder listen to the selections on the soundtrack from Kool and the Gang, The Trammps, or Ralph McDonald. Be forewarned that if you haven't heard this soundtrack in a while, it may not sound as good as you remember it when you were shaking your thing in a polyester suit under a big disco ball way back when."
3,"No more remastering, please","This is the first and last ""remastered"" mp3 I will be downloading. The heart and soul of this album has been stripped away in an effort to ""refine"" the sound. As someone else posted here, this is the perfect production if you are driving in your car at 80 mph with the windows rolled down. Too shimmery and brilliant, even for dance music. Lesson learned. I will stick to ""Album versions"" from now on."
5,Memory lane,"This CD has many,many old favorites. Takes me back to years ago. I was young and disco was crazy. I was never a fan of the movie but the songs bring back a lot of happy memories."
2,How long must we endour this?,"First the good news for this double cd. The songs are catchy and have a bit of a melody. Now the bad news (ok not all of it or I'll be here all night) This is the album that started the disco genre and 28 years later I can't figure out for the life of me that anyone would really want to listen to this crap. Every single disco song that was ever writen sounds the same, like hell. As far as music goes, it is just plain awful. I believe that a great cd is something you can turn on and be lifted by the music, this is not it. oh yeah, and somebody stop the guy from the Bee Gees from singing"
1,the day the disco died.......THANK GOD!!!,I was in my youth at the time this came out and was listening only to rock but couldnt get the sound of the Bee Gees out of my head. It was almost everywhere! Its gone now thank goodness and so is disco....long gone and good riddens. Next to go: RAP!!
4,Nice Job Dado Brother,"Dado Brother is the manager for the hip and modern Rio de Janeiro Bossa Nova band ""Bossacucanova"". He produced this CD sometime ago, and I got it as I love Bossacucanova's 2007 CD "" Uma Batida Differente"". Ipanema Lounge is all instrumental and electronica without vocals. It has a great sound and is worth buying before it runs out of production."
5,Brought back memorys,"I bought my son this toy when he was younger and being courious, he took it apart! my son is now 31yrs and I saw this and it just made me think of when he was young and even though he took it apart, I bought it to give him something he regreted taking apart so long ago! He loves it and it sits on a display shelf now. I teased him and told him not to take this one apart! We had a good laugh!"
1,Waste of money,This book sucks. All it has in it is your average common sense and stuff you can find on Military One Source.
5,"Fun, Relevant and Inspiring","As a brand new Marine Corps wife, this book led me on a fantastic journey into the military and myself. It also prepared me for how his career was about to impact my own and what to expect emotionally. Armed with knowledge and a positive outlook, I am happy to say that I love my life in the military most days, and on the days that are a challenge, I continue to use this book as my go-to guide to keep my chin up. Truly a must-have for military spouses."
4,As Advertised,"The pump arrived promptly, and was installed less than 10 days after I placed the order. Months later, no issues to report."
4,"Very good, but marred by silly speeches at the end","An interesting, unusual movie from Chaplin with some very funny moments. Still, not as funny as his previous efforts. And the ""philosophical"" speeches at the end do get pretty silly."
1,Plagiarism Alert!,"I must take offense to scotsladdie's November 2001 ""review"" of ""Monsieur Verdoux,"" since its ripped off almost verbatim from David Shipman's excellent book ""Story of Cinema,"" which also is available from Amazon. Perhaps you should give Mr. Shipman the proper credit instead of scotsladdie. Otherwise, delete this particular review from you web site. Many thanks."
2,Chaplin Classic Deserves a Better DVD,"Warner must have fell asleep at the wheel with its DVD reissue of Charlie Chaplin's ""Monsieur Verdoux."" The ""remastered"" print is dark, murky and virtually unwatchable. In fact, it's a strain on the eyes! The additional star is given only for the extras -- especially the excellent ""Chaplin Today"" documentary. This DVD should be taken off the market until Warner gets its act together."
5,"A charming, yet disturbing cinematic experience by Chaplin","Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin) is a sad story about Monsieur Verdoux who is a swindling murderer that charms women whom he marries for their assets which he sells after he has murdered a newly acquired wife. Monsieur Verdoux is driven to commit murder as he feels determined to provide the best possible life style for his family. However, Monsieur Verdoux is lost in his determination as it clouds his moral decision making, which he recognizes. Monsieur Verdoux is the darkest of Charles Chaplin's films, and as in his other films it offers a social message. This ominous message becomes apparent from the beginning of the film as Monsieur Verdoux's gravestone is depicted in the initial shot with Chaplin's voiceover that embarks on how he ended up here. Chaplin's direction offers both tragedy and comedy which in the end leaves the audience with a charming, yet disturbing cinematic experience."
4,"Well illustrated and organized,easy to follow.",Illustrations are excellent.Pages setup with easy to find info.and easy to understand text.I liked the short histories in forward.The only thing I didn't like were the amount of Herbs illustrated. There could have been alot more than the 36 shown.
4,Great Game,"My nephew is 8 and he loves this game just as his 24 yr old uncle too. A game that is fun for all, that is always a winner. A big hit in this house for sure. Kudos too Capt Jack as always."
3,A pretty good game,"This game was pretty fun. Especially in 2 player mode! Lots of sword fighting, mazes, hidden secrets, and several different weapons."
2,Not very cool,"I was expecting alot from this game, but was disappointed. Some parts are cool, but for the most part this game does in no way compare to the film."
4,An Adventure,Our daughter has been enjoying the ADVENTURE that the PS2 Pirates game provides. She plays it often.
4,Good,This game is good.I had no complaints about controlling the characters.Jack Sparrow is the coolest.If your a fan of Pirates of the Carrabien buy this.If your not then rent it first.
1,Worst PS2 Game Ever!!!,-Ok Graphics-Horible Gameplay-Million of Gliches-Very short-You battel spiders!-Nothing to do with movie-Wast of $39.99-DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
4,"Good book, but this is the OUTDATED version.","Be aware, this is the 1994 version, not the newer 2009 version you probably want. That aside, the book is well written and illustrated, and is very helpful for learning GD&T. Buy it, but get the new version."
5,Loose & tight!,"Some of this might be for Booker T complete-ists only but it is unbelievable what these guys tossed off during their coffee breaks and as filler for B-sides. Sure, some of this sounds undeveloped but it is some beautiful and relaxed playing from this amazing (and usually invisible as the Stax house band) quartet."
5,Very Happy with Purchase,"I just rec'd these and am very pleased. The size is true, as well as the colors. The fabric is substantial, not thin and cheap like so many items these days. The only warning I would have is to look closely at the pictures, as some of the fabrics have kind of a tie-dyed, mottled look to them. As I re-look at the pics, this is shown; however, I hadn't taken note of it the first time I looked at the pics. I'm ok with it, as I'll be using these as shells under jackets and sweaters, and they are still very pretty tops."
4,Funny and Informative,"One of the things I found most enjoyable about this book was its amusing approach to wine and wine drinkers. All kidding aside, this book is filled with lots of great information about wine. It is actually much more comprehensive than I ever would have expected. Good book!"
5,A very good start,He very good start if you want to know more about wine. A must for everyone who loves wine and wants to have a clear overview
3,"Good for a beginner, could use a bit more organization","For someone who's a complete novice to wine (I qualify), the book will start out very enjoyably, especially if you are interested in the wine making process. It gives you a good understanding of the types of wines, and what the names on the labels mean.The book does go a bit too much into the listing of names that mean nothing to a novice, with little room left to go into much depth about those listed. Much could have been left for the authors more specific wine books.The area that could use improvement is in the organization of the book, specifically to serving and storage. Everything seems to be there, but it stretched thoughout the book, when it needs to be in a single area for easy reference.It's all there, but you'll have to pick around to find all the really important bits."
4,Bright Crystal,"I really love this smell, no too strongThe only thing might be this perfume can not stay very long.But it's really nice :)"
4,Very pleasant,"This is a wonderful perfume. It is a floral and airy perfume that comes in a sturdy glass bottle and top. The reason I gave it four stars is that as wonderful as this smells like, it is a very nondescript smell, nothing unusal or unique about it. There simply is no lingering hint that makes it very memorable. The perfume is great if you are looking for a normal floral scent, however that will leave others thinking about you look elsewhere."
5,LOVE,"I LOVE this perfume!! I smelled the sample in a magazine last year and asked my husband what he thought of it. He liked it so much he bought it for me last year. I love it and switch it up with a couple other perfumes during the work week, but it is my go to ""special occasion/dress up"" perfume. One bottle has last me a year and I just got another bottle as a birthday gift."
5,Great,A gift for my wife that she enjoyed. It smells good too. Much cheaper than buying it at a brick and mortar place.
3,fresh smell,bright crystals reminds me of Victoria Secrets Gorgeous fragrance mist. its a very fresh smell. i bought the .17 oz bottle. i wont buy it anymore. i get a large 8.4 ox body mist from Victoria secret that smells just as good.
4,Pretty!,"I really like this fragrance. It's much lighter and fresher than I would expect from Versace, and has notes of peony and pomegranate. It's a very distinctive scent that's not at all overbearing...perfect for spring. My only complaint is that I wish the fragrance lasted longer...for me, it wears off completely after just a few hours."
3,Versace Bright Crystal Review,This is a great price for the product! I did some comparison shopping. The downside was that the bottle stayed in the hot sun before delivery.This altered the fragrance somewhat. Consider purchasing fragrances online in winter months so that heat is not a factor.
5,Great!,I have no complaints about this product. Item was exactly what I was looking for/expecting. Will order again when the time comes.
3,Doesn't smell like the sample,I am a little disappointed in the smell. It does not smell like the sample I received. I ordered this product based on the sample and the smells are different. It still smells okay but not as nice as the sample.
1,Horrible,This item does not smell like my $80 bottle I purchased from Macy's. I already opened it so I can't return it. You get what you pay for.
1,"In a million years, I would never have believed Amazon would sell a fake","...but I purchased a 3oz Versace Bright Crystal recently and it is positively not the real deal. It faintly has the same aroma so there is likely a touch of the real thing in there, but it has an overpowering amount of rubbing alcohol added. My guess is that it's a 1 to 5 ratio of fragrance to alcohol (at most).I have trusted in Amazon for a very long time and I have never questioned the quality of their products. So much so, that even though I read the numerous reviews that this product was a fake, I thought ""no way - not Amazon"", and ordered anyway. And of course, fragrances are non-returnable so I have been taken with no recourse.Don't do it. From now on I'll pay the extra and buy it at a retail department store."
1,The cologne is fake!,The cologne is fake! I would like my money back. I will be contacting amazon unless I recieve my money back. I am more than happy to return the product. Contect me at yuanmai@hotmail.com
2,"Not Classic, Too Trendy","Bright Crystal Versace is a young, bright, cute fruity-floral musk. It has a clean edge, a sweet edge, and a sexy one too - that seems unique in my book. It's a pretty & versatile scent, but it's most certainly not my style.Classic fragrances are ageless. This one isn't. The ad is not the target market - it's a reflection of what the wearer wants to be, imo. Bright Crystal Versace seems targeted to the under 25 crowd."
5,Exactly what I wanted and speedy delivery!,"Amazon.com offered a GREAT price for this perfume, cheaper than I've ever found. Speedy shipping as well for free! All in all a great deal."
3,"its not bad, but i did expect a better scent for the price i paid !","its not bad, but i did expect a better scent for the price i paid !"
5,Versace sample vial,Nice to carry in purse... My daughter was happy to recieve it as part of her birthday present. Will definately order again.
1,broken and super late,I order this perfume for my wife's birthday with 3 weeks of time and I receive it 5 weeks later plus the cap was broken and liking every where I'm not buying from this place never again. ... they said that they ship it 3 times but I don't think so is just waist of time and money plus I look bad with my late birthday present. Sucks. .
1,Beware!! Fake!!!,"My package came with an additional lotion that i did not ask for, in a very different packaging than what the Bright Crystal lotion is supposed to come with. The Bright crystal lotion's container is similar to the perfume's container, but I got a cheap plastic tube. This plus the quality of the spray and its cheap price makes me believe that this is all fake. I never asked for the additional lotion, which they included as if to overcompensate for lack of a quality product."
2,Very Disappointed,"I had previously smelled this perfume at a store in the mall. I loved the fresh scent. When I received the product, it did smell the way I wanted it too. However, once sprayed the scent does not last more than 10 minuetes. I have sprayed it on my hair, neck, clothes and wrist all at the same time hoping it would last. I should not have to spray that much of any perfume and even then, by the time I arrived to anywhere I was going, the scent was gone. I am extremely disappointed."
1,"Product is either old or was damaged by the heat, very weak scent","I did not receive shipping confirmation until a day after the package arrived at my doorstep. I checked the status of my order which said ""shipping soon,"" so I did not expect it to be sitting at my door. It was left in the hot sun for an entire day. I just found the package today and when i tried on the product, the fragrance was very weak compared to a sample I have. I believe the extreme temperature changes caused damage to the perfume. Either that, or the product was old and lost its potency. The estimated delivery was Aug. 23-27, but it was delivered on the 18th. Had I received a ship confirmation, I would have known to check for the package right away. Now I have a bottle of lightly scented water that I cannot return."
4,A good buy,"The three words that come to mind is classy,subtle and romantic. My kinda perfume.it's not over whelming, subtle but I notice that it lingers around the whole day. Can be worn day or evening, but suits more of the evening wear because of the subtle and romantic tones.Personally I like mild smells including rose, so this did it for me. On the same note I would not classify this as a floral perfume.all in all a good buy"
2,Negative,"This fragrance was not pleasant to me at all. At a first sniff, it seems ok but once on, it is overwhelming and has no appeal to it. I hear this is the most popular out of the Versace line but I strongly disagree. I rarely give negative reviews on perfumes cause I am a fragranceaholic but this one, I left in the store."
5,Delicious smelling,"I recently just received this as a sample with my Sephora order. I am also very picky with my perfumes. I don't really like all that many.When I opened this one to try it, I was pleasantly surprised. It's light and airy, and the best part of all is that it lasts! Most perfumes I enjoy tend to wear off after only an hour or so of wear. So far, this one's been lasting quite sometime.The notes from Versace state that Bright Crystal is a fresh, sensual blend of refreshing chilled yuzu and pomegranate mingled with soothing blossoms of peony, magnolia, and lotus flower, warmed with notes of musk and amber.I don't know about all that, but I know it smells wonderful!"
5,great!,"Great product, arrived right on time, great care in packaging for a good price!will be buying more soon!"
5,"Best Fragrance, Top Quality Perfum!",Simply the best of the best. It lasts so long you will have to wash it off. If you like soft and sensual perfumes you will simply love Versace Bright Crystal.
5,Best smelling perfume,"bought this for my wife two Christmases in a roll, has a wonderful smell, every one comments on it when we r out"
5,Amazing smell!,"A very fresh and light smell! I'm not a fan of ""light"" smells but I love this perfume! By far one of my favourites. I highly recommend.I did not purchase this perfume on amazon.com and from seeing all the questionnable reviews from sellers on amazon.com selling knock off perfumes, I wouldn't suggest for anyone to purchase perfumes online. Only from a department store/ drug store."
1,FAKE PRODUCT,"I can't believe this... The letters on the bottle fall off, it looks like a fake product. I contacted Amazon and the only think they would offer is a $8 rebate... now I am stucked with a fake parfume.. NOT GOOD"
2,Doesn't last,"I'm not a person who can tolerate the smell of most perfumes. The scent of this Versace Bright Crystal is actually very pleasant and acceptable. It is one of the very few I can use. However, the scent tends to disappear even before I leave my house. I usually don't questioned the authenticity of things I purchase on amazon. But I since still can't tell if it's the real thing, I'll probably buy it from sephora next time."
4,A Unique Book,"I found the book extremely easy to read and follow. The religious ideas, although presented simply, have been thoroughly researched. Some ideas were repeated more often than necessary. The book presents a radically new concept of God, far removed from the traditional personification found in many religions. However, as the author does not have a background in science he has accepted the standard party line in this field instead of questioning it. The best book I have found that blends in science and religion in a fresh and forceful way is ""Anita's Legacy."""
5,"One of the best "" postSoviet time "" Russian films .","Just a kid . Passing by a first scene of the movie ... at wrong place , at wrong time . And we glad , he did . After few minutes he gets our full attention . We realise , he just cameback from the war . We don't know , which one ... but we do . Russian policeman asked him , what exsecly he did there ... I was in the office ... a clerk ,- he unswers . But we know , he didn't . This film reminded me American movie "" Coldblooded "". Very quiet , simple , coldblooded and likebale guy . Honest and lifesmart . We understand , that he crossed his line in other place , and now he just doing his job - surviving himself , and saving his brother and few friends from agony and brutality of "" NEW "" mother Russia . Very deep and realistic film . Very solid 5 stars . Exellent soundreck too .PS : As Afghan veteran , I can feel Sergey Bodrov's character ... He is so lost in fake reality of modern Russia ..."
3,Levels of the Game,"My Russian girlfriend asked me to watch this movie before I considered moving to Russia. She said that it reflected much of how Russia is now. Mafia, violence. Certainly the movie has all of that. However, it is probably a movie which in Mexico would be considered okay to show to kindergarten kids. If you live on the US/Mexican border Brigada is a daily real life experience and Brat will not amaze and astound. If you thought of the Soviet Union as some sort of socialist nirvana then Brat will presumably enlighten. Certainly for anyone interested in learning something about Russia, like most Russian movies, Brat serves that purpose."
3,Stone cold killers,"Dark, brooding but ultimately not very satisfying movie, showing the underbelly of post-Soviet Russia. Brodov became the bad boy of Russian cinema for his stone-faced portrayal of Danila, a young hood, schooled by his older brother, Viktor. Balabonov revels in the violence of mob-ruled St. Petersburg, with plenty of footage of decayed city streets and the ruthless criminal world that had formed in the once great capital on the West Bank. But, don't expect very much irony here. The movie is underscored by an unremitting techno-music soundtrack that became painfully unbearable by movie's end. Although, the movie was heralded as one of the first ""realistic"" portrayals of post-Soviet Russia, it seems to owe more to ""gangsta rap"" than it does the mean streets of Russia."
2,Poorest example of russian film I've ever seen,"Unlike the rest of the population, I found this movie to be nothing of what the reviews said it would be: Simplistic and underdeveloped plot, little to no character development (partly the script's fault, partly bad acting), and very little (and even that is very superficial) commentary on Russian society. The only redeeming value is given by the contrast of two supporting characters' impact on the main character. I've seen a good deal of modern Russian film, and this one is just a passing craze and should be viewed as such. If you want to watch really good Russian film, look elsewhere."
4,An interesting film.,"Well it was ok.""WARNING POSSIBLE SPOLIERS""It starts out with Danila he wonders onto a movie set, he gets into trouble for it. As it turns out, he recently returned from the war. And his mother seems to admire his big brother more then him. Well anyways he goes to St. Petersburg to live with his brother. There he meets all sorts of people. He makes friends with a homeless German, with a female drugee, and he makes love to a married woman, who not only becomes his misterss, but whose husband also abuses her. He also likes music a lot too. See there's some redeming qualities right there!Well anways back to his brother, his brother isn't so innocent. His brother hires him to kill a Chechnian warlord for him. Well sooner or later, he kills mercifulessly the people sent by the Chechnian warlord. And at the end well I won't tell you the end, just watch it and see.Not recommended for children at all!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Brother is quite well-regarded both in Russia and the United States, but while it might be interesting as a sociological commentary on Russia it fails as a movie--marred by poor direction (particularly in the scene with the first murder) and fairly leaden acting, it fails to engage the viewer."
4,Brother,"The movie is about a local mafia chief's hiring Viktor to kill a rival while planning to kill him rather than pay his price for the contract. But Viktor subcontracts the job to his little brother, who has told him that he spent his military service as a clerical employee at HQ. When the goons make as if to kill him, he shows that he has hidden depths. Viktor is impressed with Danila's actions and sees that Danila is fully capable and suggests that they go into business together as the Bogrov Brothers. But now the mafia chief is now going after both of them. Danila is on the run, his brother in hiding, and as the bad guys get close there a lot of adventures that the brothers must get through so that they can survive.The movie was very good and entertaining. I give the film a B+ because it was full of action but still had some comical spots."
4,Brother Review,"I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie, but I found it to be an interesting snapshot of post-Soviet Russian life. It showed how easy it is to slip into criminal life when the opportunity presents itself.The movie was also an interesting discussion on morality. Danila was not a bad guy, though he did fit into the criminal world well. He still did what he could for those who had nothing. It was, at times, hard to reconcile the cold-blooded killer and the compassionate young man.The movie showed and interesting dynamic between the two Danilas. There was also the family dynamic; his brother was willing to put Danila's life in danger. Desperate times call for desperate measures.Overall, the movie was entertaining. It was heavy, but with a few lighter spots so the viewer doesn't get overwhelmed."
3,Review of The Brother,"Danila`s character was very interesting -the movie made me to think who was the real bad guy in this movie, Danila or his older brother. I think that the older brother really didn`t need to draw Danila into criminal life. He was comfortable with this life style from the beginning. He didn`t seem to have any problems to kill people and he didn`t show any remorse afterwards.But there was still some good side left in him and I think that the music represented it. Danila became young and enthusiastic while listening music. That side of him was totally different than the cold-blooded killer.I think this movie was quite realistic. It also showed some nice shots of the city of St. Petersburg even though the movie made the city look grey and depressing. But it fit to the plot very well, there wasn`t much light in these people's lives either.In overall, the movie was quite good. Better than I expected."
4,BROTHER,"BROTHER by Alexei Balabanov is, as the cover says, a stylish gangster film set in St Petersburgh as the Soviets are falling from grace and a state of anarchy. Sergei Bodrov Jr. plays the part of a soldier returning from National Service (was is a boring office job or something somewhat more sinister).He seeks his elder brother only to find him enmeshed in a life of crime and murder. Our hero turns on a tough guy performance 'par excellence'. Balabanov's direction is taut and memorable. I particularly liked the 'fade to black' between sequences over the sudden 'quick as a blink' style so popular.This is not a film for the squeamish despite the absence of the vile graphic depictions in American films of this genre."
3,The sequel was at least a star better...,"I saw Brother 2 years before i just saw the original, and had great expectations for it. Both are way too hollywoody, and way short on realism...As a Russian, i get that this movie is not as much about killing, as it is about relationships between brothers, and people in general during that time. So, it would have been much better if the producer developed those relationships more, and injected less Hollywood fairytale...I love the plot of both films, and the morals of the story; it was just executed and presented in a real primitive way..."
4,"Vivid, insightful, inspiring account of cancer survival","Linda Phelan McCoy captures the intensity, confusion and heart wrentching reality that is experienced by every young woman who must cope with a diagnosis of breast cancer in her book ""Twenty - Something & Breast Cancer"". Her touching accounts of her spiritual and physical adversities and explorations provide invaluable insight, comfort and inspiration to all women surviving cancer and their families alike. Being a young woman and surviving cancer twice, I feel this account is a ""must read"" and is testimony to the power of spiritual fortitude."
3,Duplicate listing for Brentwood L & H - UTOPIA/Vol 1 - 3 DVD,"This appears to be a duplicate listing for the Brentwood LAUREL & HARDY 14 Program - UTOPIA / VOLUMES 1 - 3 DVD listed elsewhere as ASIN B0002M5U3S.The only difference is that that release is on two double-sided discs, this appears to be four single-sided discs.BCI is the distributor for Brentwood."
3,"If you like the Spin Doctors, you will like this CD","With typical lead singing and back beat, this is a fair attempt at keeping the excitement going from their Pocketful of Krytonite. The lyrics are good, and so is the music, but little new appears in either case."
2,garbage...,"not to bash the doc's...but this is the worst ive heard. I bought ""Pocket Full of Kryptonite"" on a whim, absolutely loved it, and bought this album just 20 minutes ago. simply awful...redundant, whiny, the vocals barely held a note. the only bearable song is sister sysiphus. If you like their sound, get pocket full of kryptonite."
3,Nobody's talkin',"Odd song selections on this ""best of"". The much better choice is ""Many Sides"". Some major songs are missing here and some minor ones are included. By no means an awful CD but one can do better for a cross section of songs by one of the best of his era."
5,A masterpiece - not to be missed,"If you have not heard the 4th symphony of Braga Santos, you have missed one of the great joys in life. From the heart-beating lament in the 2nd movement to the magnificent life-asserting finale, this music will truly embrace you.I will never understand the continuing neglect of this masterpiece,(and of this composer)especially with the increasing Latino population in the U.S. Is there not at least one prominent red-blooded conductor who could include this in a program? This music would bring the house down."
4,Good quality,My son loves this good quality animal. He's crazy into Mammoths because of Ice Age. As usual Schleich lives up to its name.
1,Order this item and the company will send you pants,"I ordered this item and my account also shows that I ordered this item. However, the vendor claims that this item is pants. They have terrible customer service and now I will not receive the slippers (intended as a christmas gift) or a refund until the pants are sent back, reprocessed and the slippers reordered. Order your slippers elsewhere."
4,Scandalous...even in this day and age,"I was amused by this story because even though it was written so long ago, I was still able to relate to it in the year 2013. The characters were well developed and the plot lines had enough twists to make this a quick, enjoyable read. The ending really surprised me!"
1,This is Jezebel's daughter?,Why does this Amazon entry for JEZEBEL'S DAUGHTER show the cover of THE GREAT GATSBY?
1,"Misleading description, cheap product.","What I thought I was ordering was a Madcatz-brand gold-plated PS3 component cable, like the one in the product image.What I received was an obviously cheap knockoff cable with no brand, plain connectors, and a plug that almost wouldn't fit into my PS3. False advertisement at its finest.The quality of the image when using this plug is terrible. You can literally see each individual color as a separate band ghosting across the screen.Don't be fooled: you're not getting a high-quality cable for six dollars; You're getting a knockoff that you didn't order.Returned."
4,A Pastor's Perspective,"A someone who has transitioned from a more traditionally structured church into a small network of Simple Churches, I have found Tony & Heather's material very helpful and constructive. It helped me gain perspective on something I already sensed the Lord speaking to me about, and the simple but profound presentation in this book makes it very accessible for many people."
4,Read and Consider,"Different paradigms are always fascinating. I suggest reading this and considering how any of your current beliefs about church can be ""re-thought""."
4,Not as good as Black Sunday,Black Sunday has funky party tunes while this album is quite dark. Don't get me wrong I love this album but Black Sunday was better. I would of given this album 5 stars if they had added The Fugees remix of Boom Biddy Bye Bye. That track is dope. If you wanna just chill then I would recommend this album. But if you are the type that is always dancin then Black Sunday is for you. LONG LIVE CYPRESS HILL.
3,More hits from the bong.,"This third disc from the ""Stoned Raiders"" isn't half as upbeat as ""Black Sunday"" was, but it's still not bad. I wouldn't say it's mellow, but it is darker, and sets a certain mood. It almost has a trip-hop vibe to it. Where the first two albums were great to get the party started, this one seems perfect for after the party. Something to throw on at three o'clock in the morning and just chill with, in a smokey atmosphere of course. No big singles from this, but ""Throw Your Set In The Air"", ""Illusions"", and ""Everybody Must Get Stoned"" are all good. I'd pick this one up after another one."
3,Still Chronic,"i personally have listened to the dope album,n purchased it, n i was disappointed as to where in the f**k is Sen Dog, mostly this album consisits of B-Real, i mean i fought cypress hill were a group, cuz i don't hear much of sen dog, maybe b-real should go solo, cuz he's half way there. don't get me wrong tho, this album is dope, n if i had to say, i would say ""Throw your set in the air"", which was on the simpsons episode which starred cypress hill, is good, n most off the tracks, cuz if u like the first song your probably going to like the rest, cuz most of the songs sound alike. keep it reall all y'all"
5,Cypress Hill will never top this.,"This cd takes a little time to fully imerse within it, but once your inside the temple...there aint no comin out. Before the Hill went mainstream with their latest release(wich was disipointing). They were alot grittier, more violent, and all around much cooler. This album is a lyrical slash musical masterpiece. I got this cd right when it came out, and it made made me a true fan of hiphop, it was constantly bumped. And after all these years I still toss it in every now an then. Cause perfection never gets old. So if you wanna hear the real wicked Cypress style, then I recomend this much higher then the rest of their collection, and almost all other cds for that matter."
4,BOOM....,Cypress Hill comes back to their old style of gangsta rap as in their first CD. This is a must have for any Cypress Hill fans. Not as good as the first or second albums but it is better then the fourth album.
5,No Question...,"The best of Cypress Hill albums.Beats, lyrics, cover art works... all these are perfect.Muggs has become my favorite hip hop producer by this album.The dark tone in general will lead you to the fantastic world.U MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM!!!Strongly recommended!!!!!"
4,This is great album. Period.,"...I am a big Cypress Hill Fan. I think it has to do with the fact that DJ Muggs is on the greatest producers in hip-hop. Suprisingly, Cypress Hill's best songs are slow (Boom Biddy Bye Bye, Illusions, Temple of Boom, ect.). This isn't true for most hip-hop acts that have to rely on their party tracks. Masterpiece."
3,"Nice, but nothing more","The films included in this collection are nice, old trash-movies, especially ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" with the great George Eastman a.k.a. Luigi Montefiori. However, the quality is VERY bad. I know 20 years old tapes that have a better picture. Plus the picture-format is not the original one (for exmaple ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" is included in 1,33:1, but its original format is 2,35:1 (Cinemascope) !!!). The main reasons why should buy this box anyway is:a)Some films included are available on DVD for the first timeb)It's damn cheap !BUT I've you already own this titles as good quality tapes, you needn't buy this since the quality surely isn't any better.By the way, the DVD-edition of ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" (a.k.a. ""New Barbarians"") from ""Shriek show"" is much better, but costs more than this whole box.Sadly, the DVDs are flippers, so watch out for sratches !"
1,Garage. Total Trash.,I fell asleep listening to this album. This album is better suited for a funeral home. YUCK.
1,She's so talented (at sampling)!,"Yeah, I'd like to see her actually play that riff from Chopin's Winter Wind Etude, let alone sing at the same time. Please, it's actually insulting to REAL pianists. I have to agree with the other reviewer who pointed out the single critical factor of her success: LOOKS.Contrast Keys to Beyonce. Although Beyonce, too, owes most of her success to her looks, at least she can sing without going overboard, and she even has some signature vocal riffs which set her apart. Alicia Keys has NOTHING innovative, plus her voice is rather weak and stale. So she tries to compensate with relentless vocal acrobatics, and it's EXASPERATING.Oh, and just because she writes her own music, unlike most in hip-hop/R&B, doesn't mean it's good. Stevie Wonder she's not.Basically, Keys falls into the category of overrated, overhyped egos who can't dance. Like Mary J Blige... Oh no, don't get me started on her..."
2,Typical,"Oh joy, another so called R&B artist who over sings every other note. Some decent moments but the hints of hip hop really dash any semblance of credibility. Buy some Motown instead."
2,Good and original!....,"er.... ....unfortunately the bits that are good are not original and the bits that are original are not good.The music and vocals sounds a lot like Destiny's Child on this album - sung by a soloist instead of a trio. The songs are predictable and Ms Keys has made an album that is very substandard, in my opinion. Ms Keys is supposed to be some sort of great 'talent'. Well, she sounds like she's got writer's block on this album.Not much else to say except a warning - never buy an album where more time, money and effort has gone into the artist's clothes, makeup and photography than the actual music on the disc. If Alicia Keys is the 'future' of R'n'B, then God help us all!"
5,"What more can u say for a CLASSY, GREAT singer....","This album is Classic R&B Soul, Alicia has done it again this album is awesome, My favorite Tracks are ""If i ain't got you"", ""You don't know my name"", & ""Heartburn""......The rest of the album is great too these are just my favorites......She just such a talented humble girl who doesnt use SEX to Sell her albums, she is a Great Pianist also. I respect her alot for what she does and what she brings to the Table......."
5,Hot and Vibin',The Diary of Alicia Keys is one of the best soul/ R&B albums I have ever heard. Her style in this ablum is a combination of Classical with some funk old school. I highly recommend anybody who loves soul music to buy this album because you'll be satisfied.
5,Diary is a Must have,"If u got the her debut songs in a minor, then you defintely have to rush and get this one. Diary is way better than songs in a minor. This Cd will go down in history as one of the best R&B/soul record. Enough said"
4,I changed my mind,"So I use to own this album but then I gave it away, after listening to it a few times and decided that because I didn't pay for it, it was not any money lost, Well now, I heard,Diary, loved it, heard you don't know my name, loved it, then I heard if I anit got you, loved it, now mind you I had this CD, but was like, not! Listening to this CD on the Radio made me change my mind seeing the videos made me say: I want my CD BACK!!!!"
5,Diary Worth Reading,"This is what I wrote with regards to A.Keys album on Dec.2nd 2003Alicia Keys is back with her sophmore album titled ""Diary"". Yet again she has proved that she is no gimmick. Ms. Keys has proven that she is such a true lyricist, a true performer...a true everything. Songs such as ""Diary"", ""If I Ain't Got You"", and ""Karma"", tells a tale that she is a woman-""lord knows its hard"". Alicia's first single ""You Don't Know My Name"" was produced by Chicago's own Kanye West. Mesmirized by her mellonic tone and sculpture of words, voice and music, her fans will watch as her career grows. Clive Davis was searching for a long lasting artist...he did not know that he also found an angel.Well today, I will still stay by my words. She is why I continue to strive for my aspirations for being in the business (corporate wise). She is a great performer and her album is still worth the listen. If you don't have it, get it!"
5,The Diary of A.K.,"Sticking with the soul circuit, one album I have kept in my CD player for months has been Miss Alicia Keys' second effort ""The Diary of Alicia Keys."" What a wonderfully done album and a superb example of how to grow from one album to the next. Miss Keys flows as beautifully as her name. All facets of this talent has blossomed tremendously from her debut, which was a masterpiece in its own right. What really gets me with Alicia Keys is her inevitable ability to blend classic piano training with crazy hot hip-hop beats that somehow results in a great sonic balance that appeals to all. Even her dabble with old soul classics are brillantly revived in a way that is respectful of the original, but has crazy modern appeal. Only true talent can exude such excellence in its craft. As track #3 says, ""Go 'head girl"".Recommendation: A must-get if you love R&B soul music. A definite if you want to relive Alicia's brillance from her first album."
4,"Good Album, Could of been better","I've had time to digest this album. First off, the album as a whole is worth the purchase. Songs like ""Diary"", ""Dragon Days"", and ""If I Was Your Woman"" are some of the albums gems. While songs like ""You Don't Know My Name"", and ""If I Ain't Got You"" will join tracks from her last album like ""Fallen"", as a staple of her unique sound. The more she matures, ventures out into different things, she will quickly develope a style, where music fans can say ""That's Alicia""!My gripe are with the first three full tracks. They just didn't work. Other than that, great follow up!"
4,It's so unfortunate...,"It's unfortunate that in this day and age a singer is not judged upon their singing or songwriting ability but their looks and who they lay with. The Diary of Alicia Keys is very strong lyrically. Ms. Keys has written songs that convey a maturity way beyond her 23 years. These are songs that will be re-recorded 20 years from now; however, she isn't being given the credit that she deserves. Until the day press grows weary of its fascination with the Beyonce's and Britney's of the world, the public will continue to be bombarded by marginal singing and juvenile lyrics. My question to Alicia Keys is, who's promoting you? Whomever they are, you need to fire them! It's time to step up your game and blast the nauseating competition out of the water."
3,a little less than expected,"I heard some samples of the album online and I was impressed with songs Diary and You Don't Know My Name, so I went out and bought this. The music is good and alicia has a gift for singing and playing piano, but now I have come to realize that Songs in A Minor is a much more enjoyable album. Well that one grew on me too, so this one may overtime."
3,you know her name now.,"alica keys is talented and a good piano player. her song you don't know my name was good. but the best song was if i ani't got you. anyway, this album was better than her last. so buy it now!!!"
4,Falls a litte short,"I have never really been a big fan of her music, but after listening to her second disc it kind of falls short like the first one.It starts off very slow with dry up tracks like Heartburn ,Karma and the worst Walk on by (at track she never should have touched.After that the cd really pics up. With Mellow tracks like Diary and Slow Down her true skills really shines .Overall it a pretty good cd though not one to run out and grab but USED.This cd does not break new ground for her thought.Maybe next time"
3,Part 2?,"Ok, now I am a fan of Ms. Keys and I love the fact that she is trying to do real music. However I was not very impressed by this CD. There are too many songs on here that sound exactly like her last CD. Same chords, there is one song that is the same exact beat. I expected so much more from someone with her talent. I am not sure if this is a sign of her being held back by company people not willing to give her full artistic control.I was glad to see that she enlisted Kanye West for production, he mos def gives that old school feel that you hear on ""you dont know my name"". Sad to say but that is one of the best songs on the album. The titel track with the tonies is nice as well. A decent CD all the more, but not a 5 star by far"
4,The Run Down,"HEY ALICIA KEYS FANS. THIS CD IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM HER OLD ONE. MOST OF THE SONGS TALK ABOUT MEN, NOT LIKE SONGS IN A MINOR. IT HAS ABOUT 6 GREAT SONGS, WORTH BUYING IF YOUR A KEYS FAN, BUT NOT WORTH IT IF YOUR A CASUAL LISTENER!!!"
5,Let the musicians rise again! Old School revival!,"Alicia Keys has done a superb job on her second CD. She has injected herself right smack into old school. Her full bodied musical effort conjures the street corner harmony of The Delfonics with a generous tinge of Teena Marie inspired musicianship. To just say I absolutely love this CD doesn't even come close to describing the total listening pleasure it gives me. The many no-talents ( 50 Cent, G Unit, Ashanti...) spitting out jive CDs need to take notice of this more than stellar CD.It is in a class all to itself."
5,I love this album,"The first time I got it, I wasn't thrilled with it the way I was with songs in a minor. It sounded a little too polished even though alicia was expressing her talent beautifully. But overtime I begin to love the album and I consider it an r&b classic now. Her piano playing has improved and is much more mature, and alicia pays tribute to music of the 70's combined with piano and modern day r&b vocals. Definitely worth purchasing."
5,An amazing CD,"This CD is truly genuine! It is great from start to finish! In my opinion MUCH BETTER than her 1st effort. Although her first CD was good, too....this one just soars! Not just all piano but has some really jammin' beats to it! My favorite song on here is ""Karma""-----awesome song! Heartburn is another really good tune as well. There is maybe 1 or 2 songs I don't really care much for but the majority are great! A must have!!!!!"
2,"...""Diary"" Is All That...","When i heard this album (the whole thing) I was very disapointed because I thought it would be as good as her first album, but I was wrong. Some of the songs are good like ""Harlem Nocturne (intro)"", ""Karma (my favorite track)"", ""Heartburn (one of my favorite tracks)"", ""You Don't Know my Name (the best song on the album)"", ""If I Ain't Got You"", ""Diary (amazing)"", then...the album really gets wacker by the minute. To tell you the truth ""Songs In A Minor (2003) "" is better than ""Diary"", I don't reccomend this album to anyone, save your money or burn the cd, not worth the $10 or $15 bucks, (and I love Alicia, and do think she's tight, but...)"
2,Not so good,"Compared to her fist album, this one is a piece of crap. This album makes millie vanilly look like a masterpiece. I'm really disappointed,and pissed off i wan't my money back. (p.s. don't buy this crap)"
2,Alicia Keys New Album,"Well, Alicia has done it again. Personally, I don't care for this album. Maybe my taste has changed because I loved ""Songs in A Minor"". When I saw the track listings, I was excited to hear ""Karma, Heartburn and Dragon Days"", I was upset because I didn't like the songs. I'm not feelin' this album. Everyone has a different taste so, Don't take my word for it, if you like Alicia Keys, go get the album, but I'm glad I heard the album online before I bought it or else I would've been upset."
3,"Sophmore Slump, not here...","I'm not a really big Alicia Keys fan, but I am a big fan of good music. The song that I heard that really sparked my interest into this CD was ""Diary"", by far my favorite and one of THE best songs on the CD. I think alot of the more fast paced songs/beats weren't all that great but the messages of the songs were. I wish this CD contained more jazzy, slower, hot tracks like her first CD had. Overall, my fav's are:""You Don't Know My Name""""Diary""""If I Ain't Got You""""Feeling You Feeling Me"" (I wish were a full song)"
4,She's doin it again...but BETTER!!,"This record is AMAZING! I'm lovin every bit of it. All types of emotions and vibes are set in this album. How ever it is you feel for a certain somebody...if you like a certain someone but you don't have a way of hookin up, YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME...right now, I'm havin that feelin of wanting this guy..I could give him more than what his woman gives him, and because of this record OOoOOHh my gewdness!!! IT'S GONNA BE UNSTOPPABLE for real. OOHH!! It's EXCLUSIVE and I'm inspired :-) I love Alicia Keys more than before because her music has a connection towards my life. If you know what I'm feelin, than you got to get this album..It's hott!!!"
2,Not as good as her first album.,"I loved ""Songs In A Minor""...though there were a few so-so songs, they were more than made-up for by some absolutely amazing songs filled with moving, wonderful moments...While the ""The Diary of Alicia Keys"" has no truly crappy music (I find all the songs enjoyable enough to listen to), there are none of the highs or beautiful moments from before...can't help but feel disappointed by this. It's very pop, more commercial, much less soulful, and the piano doesn't feature in the gorgeous way it did before.It seems a lot like the Tracy Chapman Syndrome to me...first great album by a down-to-earth, struggling, for-real artist expressing raw emotion, desires and needs...followed by average second album by a well-off, comfortable person who no longer has much to say..."
2,A disappointment,"I fell in love with Keyes' voice when I first heard ""Fallin'"" and immediately bought her first CD. I enjoyed some of the music from it, and felt she showed enormous potential. This second CD is a real disappointment. The songs all have very similar themes: Songs in A Minor had much more variety. She needs to use her tremendous voice and talent to expand past the hum-drum, run-of -the-mill background beats and music. I really feel that she is settling for the sound or style of a mediocre singer and songwriter, when she could be so much more. She seems almost to ignore her classy, intelligent side, afraid to leave the comfort of her ""street"" attitude. I'd love to see her combine both. ""Fallin'"", I hope, won't be her only glorious hit. Here's hoping her next CD is better."
2,NOT WORTH THE HYPE,"I WAS NEVER REALLY A BIG ALICIA KEYS FAN, BUT I DO ENJOY SOME OF HER MUSIC. I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR THE FIRST ALBUM BUT THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT CAME OUT AS SINGLES THAT I LIKED VERY MUCH. NOW, THIS CD.....HATE IT! IT HAS NOTHING TO IT. ""YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME"" IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS! WHEN THAT SONG CAME OUT, I THOUGHT THE CD WOULD HAVE MORE TO OFFER BUT IT DOESN'T. I HAPPEN TO LIKE ""DIARY"" BUT THAT'S IT! THIS CD WAS A COMPLE WASTE OF MY TIME."
3,Alicia Keys,Don't get me wrong I do like Alicia Keys and I usually like her music but I really didnt admire this cd. All the songs were so mellow for me that it put me to sleep.
5,&amp;quot;Hot&amp;quot;,"Alicia Keyes, Continues to deliver!!!She is an amazing musician, an unbelieveable performer, and If you had any doubts in her before... this album will show you just how good she really is! There are few CD'S that you can listen to from start to finish and this is without a doubt one of them. What a talented woman. Go Alicia!!!"
3,Decent Album,"This album will leave you wondering just how many old albums she is in posession of because the loops and intros are so familiar it hurts. That aside, this is an enjoyable album if you are looking for an alternative to the pop sound. My personal favroties are ""Diary"", ""So Simple"", and ""You Don't Know My Name"". The verdict is still out on ""Dragon Days"" because for all its interesting twists and turns I can only play it but so much. The jazz vibe ""Nobody Not Really"" has is a nice finishing track although it is listened as an interlude."
5,Best CD Of the Year,"Alicia has a true diary here. She sings and plays excellently, more maturely and lyrics are better (although I think Songs In A Minor is a shade better). Still go buy this CD!!!!!!Fav 5:1. If I Ain't Got You2. You Don't Know My Name3. Karma4. Diary5. If I Was You Woman"
4,No appreciation!!!!,"Basically i think a lot of people who are dubbing this album in terms of it being poor or not as good as the previous release from this extremely talented artist are perhaps blinded by commercialism, i understand that some of the songs are not as initially catchy as her previous debut, yet this is not to be diffrentiated with as being poor only an avid fan of music or a musician in their own right can appreciate the depth and quality of this artist and of the talent that is so clearly displayed in this album.It is beautifully laid out and i only wish that other artists such as alicia keys would wipe out the talentless artists that continue to dominate the charts... cough cough the cheeky girls WTF!!!!HARLEMS NOCTURNE is stunning i hope her following album explores her talent as a pianist even further!!!!she is amazing NUFF LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Diary of Alicia Keys,"This maybe one of those cd's that will be great after a couple of times of playing it. But right now it's just ok. It's a well to do album, but it doesn't come close to her first cd. If you are comparing it to the other choices out there right now, it is excellent."
5,MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST CD,"Please do not listen to half of the reviews you see posted here. This is an excellent album that keeps your attention. The first album for the most part put me to sleep. Not to knock that album, but those who have a wide musical taste would definetly enjoy this album. To sum it up, it's better than the first album..anyone who disagrees apparently got caught up in the hype of her first effort."
3,Second Album: A Little Off Key.,"I've been a huge fan of Miss Keys since her first album dropped in 2001. I was definitely looking forward to this one, after hearing her ""You Don't Know My Name"" single in heavy rotation on the radios.. .but I have to say, this album was a bit of a disappointment. Alicia's extremely talented and blessed with a powerful voice, but there were some awkward moments on this album. She sings about her medulla oblongata being electrified, having cardiac arrest, and trying medication for her ""heartburn"" on ""Heartburn"" and ""Slow Down"" ..?! And ""When You Really Love Someone"" sounds like another version of ""A Woman's Worth."" She seems to be artistically experimenting with several of her tracks and she's certainly shown passion and dedication to her work. I just don't think this album matches her incredible talent and potential. Still, some beautiful melodies on this record like ""If I Ain't Got You."" Good album, definitely not my favorite."
3,About what I expected,"First off, I wasn't amazed by her last album. So I came into this one with lower expectations than most people. And once again, Alicia gives us a slightly above average. But nothing great - nothing up to the level of her talent. She continues to underwhelm. We are still waiting for that breakout album."
4,Crucial Keys,"Much, much, MUCH better than ""Songs In A Minor"", which, in my opinion, was just awful. The only good tracks from 'A Minor' were the released singles. But ""The Diary Of Alicia Keys"" makes up for past mistakes, big time.From start to finish, 'Diary' works on a variety of levels. From head bobbing tracks such as ""Dragon Days"", ""So Simple"", and ""Karma"" (to the clueless person that gave Alicia a bad review and claimed to not know what karma means has very little to no credibility and should be scrolled past with the quickness. Besides, he/she claimed Ashanti was better. Oookay...) to smooth tracks like ""You Don't Know My Name"", ""Diary"" and ""Slow Down"" makes this album a sure hit. Toss in a few slow tracks (""If I Ain't Got You"", ""Wake Up"" and When You Really Love Someone"") and there you have it: a much deserved award winning album."
3,Very similar to Songs in A Minor,I see that Alicia has taken it up a notch for the first two songs excluding the intro. Though most of her songs i found to be slow and didn't have much variety to it. It wi very similar to her first album. The background vocals are similar as well as the beats and the slow tempo. I give 3 stars because she hasn't really spread her wings to find a new noise except for Karma and Heartburn. I also found the phone conversation on You Don't Know My Name to be kinda silly and long. Alicia needs more funky beats and innovative tunes in her music. Though some slow songs are good.
3,Good Potential - Still not blown away,"When I played this cd for the first time I was not immediately blown away. Diary is a better improvement from Songs in a minor which also did not blow me away. The cuts I like on diary are ""you don't know my name, ""If I ain't got you"",""diary"",""dragon days"", and ""wake up"". ""Heartburn"" is the weakest track which does not fully showcase Alicia's abilities as a singer and songwriter. I think Alicia Keys has good potential as an artist, but her studio work still leaves much to be desired IMO. I like her better live. I would like to see her work with a more accomplished producer on her next cd. I give diary three stars because it is much better than Songs in a minor. Alicia is still vastly overrated and still needs time to grow as an artist. I would recommed buying ""Comfort Woman"" by Meshell Ndegeocello who is very underrated."
2,It is aight,"Compared to her first album and all the time off that Alicia took to be able to sit back and watch these bubble gum, naked girls with no vocal skills...well let's just say I have been waiting and hoping this album would blow them out of the water! You Don't Know My Name got me like whoa!!!!!!!!!!!!! & kept in anticipation for the other songs. When listening to this album I was not really impressed. Slow Down & When U Really Love Someone are a couple of songs that people might be like that is nice. If you are a fan just due to Alicia's piano skills just know that everything she plays on this album is sampled (not original) and the beats sound the same as her last album. Thank goodness I listned to my sisters advice and just copied the whole album from her CD. She gets 2 stars for 1 asounding song (U Don't Know My Name) & u can pick the other. These other songs just did not catch my attention."
2,Didn't care for the CD,I wasn't real happy after I received and listened to this cd. I only recognized two songs and I didn't care for any of the others. :(
2,ok,I like the idea of alicia keys. A girl who admires the 70's and wants to produce albums that sound like it. Good for her but I like her bands music more than I like her voice. In #1 Harlems... she just talks and talks and in you don't know my name she talks and talks again. Shut up and sing girl.
1,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed in this album. I fell in love with her first release but this was nothing like that one. The first one had so many songs that instantly stuck in your head, but nothing on this album really moved me. She didn't use her amazing voice to its full potential on this one either. Disappointing."
2,I thought it sucked,"I'll give it an 'A' for effort, but I think it sucks...Alicia Keys is overrated."
2,A boring listen,"I thought this CD would be great after reading these reviews, but it's just your standard run-of-the-mill stuff. Nothing great. Her voice sounds strained on some songs, and her piano playing is very, very basic for such an ""accomplished"" musician. I can't say I understand the hype here.Many of these songs sound like a reworking of her previous tunes. I'm going to either exchange this CD or get a refund."
3,Pretty Good,Its really good. Alicia Keys is really very talented. I enjoyed all of the songs on this album.
5,A diary worth reading,"The Diary of Alicia Keys is a soulful mix of R&B and Jazz. It is easy to enjoy, and the songs are smooth and catchy. My personal favorite song is ""Diary"", which features Tony Toni Tone. The cd flows very well, and I would definately recommend buying it."
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE,"Diary of Alicia Keys was disappointing and waste of my money. I expected so much after listening to her single, ""You Don't Know My Name"". I was thinking that Alicia was going to set it off and really bring it. I thought the first CD,Songs in A Minor, was an OK CD, but did not live up to the hype. I think she is talented. Don't get me wrong, but on this cd she seems to be rambling and out of artistic steam. It seems as though she is trying to ""be"" so many things (neo-soulster, 70's soulster, and classical). She managed to pull it off on the first CD, but on The Diary, it doesn't seem natural. It's forced. She gets a gold star for ""You Don't Know My Name"". Maybe those that buy into the hype, and are not interesting in musical depth will enjoy this CD."
5,Light years ahead of her debut,"I feel compelled to write this review partially to balance out the first review here. Alicia Keys's new album is gorgeous. If you are a fan of the soul/r&b from the 60s and 70s, you will be very happy with these songs. The most striking thing is how much stronger Alicia's voice is now than on her first album. Most of the singers in her age group seem to have gotten weaker vocally, but not Alicia. Lyrically and musically, this album is light years ahead of Songs in A Minor (SIAM). SIAM was a good album, but the fact that she wrote parts of it when she was 14 are reflected in the music. ""Diary"" is full of gorgeous melodies, gorgeous vocals, and some killer instrumentation. Alicia should be very proud."
4,A lovable sophomore feat,"Alicia Keys once again give listeners something enchanting to listen to... It may be basically her same, traditional R&B; sound, but she has indeed matured as a vocalist and comes forth with classy, outstanding style on this album.The radio superhit ""If I Ain't Got You"" is here, and a true highlight among the 15 song set; Her strong vocals give the ladies a new anthem with the infectious ""Karma""; She sings with genuine emotion about love's ups and downs in the soulful ""Samsonite Man"" and ""When You Really Love Someone"". The sweet, free-flowing title track is easily my favorite of all the songs. Kanye West's hypnotizying ""So Simple"" is another great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes remarkable singing and good R&B; music."
4,NICE,"Some dude gave her a 1 star review and called Alicia a sucka...he needs to get a dictionary or something...pass the 2nd grade...have your own opinion, but back it up.Diary is a pretty good CD...I don't listen to a lot of RnB, mostly just hip hop, but Alicia Keys stands out to all the Ciaras, Beyonces and Ashantis out there. Music-wise and personality wise. Her voice tops all those other artists with their synthesized voices and boring repetative club beats. She actually has musical talent other than singing (piano, duh)anyway, go out and get this album if you want a taste of real un-synthesized RnB"
4,All around good album...,If you like soulful music and true singing get this album. Alicia keys is truly talented and she will continue to be a driving force in female R&B.
5,Exellent keys,"Go alicia, she is getting better and better. Also i like that new remix of Karma with stevie wonder's Superstition, Supurb work. Thats the talent i'm talkin about, unlike britney spears who is retiring (thank god). GET THIS CD, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!"
2,2nd Star Only for the If I Ain't Got You Remix,"The If I Ain't Got You Remix where there is a jamming session on the Piano and some bass in the backround is the only good song to come from Alicia Keys since she hit the music scene. Seriously, what a horrible collection of music she has made. Boring ""artsy"" songs that could never qualify as REAL art. I would buy this CD just for that one remix, however, amazon didn't put track samples on this page and I don't know if that remix is on here... Even then probably I am not gonna pay the outrageous lowest price of $9 (at the time of this review) for just that 1 track. Can anyone who knows the version I'm talking about help me find that song Plz?"
5,A Keys = A +,"The only thing I have to say is that this album is awesome. I can't stop listening to it. The album is good from beginning to end. From ""Harlem's Nocture"" to ""Nobody Not Really"", this album is hot. The bonus cd is a great addition as well. If you don't pick up this album, you will be missing out on something special. God Bless Alicia Keys!!!"
4,Ms. Keys does it again,Alicia Keys def. brings it in her latest effort. The songs included on this disc are what we would expect from such a talented artist. The songs are heartfelt and sung with dedication. I give props to Ms. Keys for bringing this talented effort and not leaving me disappointed. Fav. song #6 and #11
4,Great CD,This is an absolutely great cd...I think it's better than her first one. She is a wonderful artist.
5,fantastic JAMMIN',"This album is pure good. ALL the tracks are hot. I'm telling you. I'm not even saying this because it's Alicia Keys. Before I bought it, my sister asked me if I'd listen to other tracks (I hadn't listened to any of the tracks but ""You Don't Know My Name""). After buying it I was scared that I'd like only 5 songs...not true. When I listened to it on my discman and I got HOOKED. haha I can't help but listen to ALL the tracks. They are very old skool mixed with some new stuff.VERY NICE STUFFI say, GRAB IT!!among my favorites:HEARTBURN(lovely funk!)you don't know my namesamsonite manso simplewake upif i ain't got youwhen you really love someoneif i was your woman"
3,It's good...not great,I liked the majority of the songs on this CD but not all of them. I think is is still growing and that is a good thing. I can't wait to see what happens with her next attempt.
5,Keep it rollin! Thank God for Ak..Haters stepped off!,"Wow! How does she make this so easy, there are other artists who have problems following up to a successful beginning and for Miss Keys to come up with such a brilliant album, says alot! I looooove this album, better than the first..."
2,Disappointment,"This is basically a weak rehash of Alicia's superior debut album. Several intros sound like intros on the first album and what the album is lacking is strong melodies! A great voice and talented piano player she is, but her songwriting skills leave to be desired. And lose the cheapo drum sounds and use a real drummer next time, please!There are no stand out tracks apart from You Don't know My Name, so I doubt the album will yield as many hits as the first one did."
3,its coo,"though this second album wasnt as dope as her first one, i enjoyed it. i guess i set really high expectations for this cd being its her sophomore album. in this album, i only have 5 tracks that i continually play..KARMA...IF I WAS YOUR WOMAN (lovin it!!)...YOU DONT KNOW MY NAME...IF I AINT GOT U (personally i think this is the best song in the cd)...and DIARY. all the other songs is hard to get into coz they sound like 70's tv show theme songs. her 1st cd i could listen to the whole thing over and over and over...this one i gotta selectively listen to. but Ms.Keys is the DOPEST artist out there! you can tell her music comes from the heart..still worth purchasing!"
4,Excellent follow-up,"Let me start by saying, except for a few songs, I wasn't feeling her debut album. I think Alicia Keys is extremely talented and ifshe continues to put out quality like THE DIARY OF ALICIA KEYS, she will be here to stay.It's a nice blend of old R&B & modern sound. It's very adult, especially in comparison with the other so called young ""artists.""While the CD is very good, it doesn't have many ""radio friendly"" songs. The singles will not do as well as the over-played ones on SONGS IN A MINOR. That's not a bad thing, especially given the fact that most of what's out on the radio is trash. There's a few tracks that will take some time to grow on but no big deal.This CD will stand the test of time. It's a great CD to sit back and relax to And my wife loves it."
3,I would give this a 2.5,I would give this a 2.5 because half the songs I like and Half the songs I hate
2,This is a diappointed follow up.,"This is not the album I was expecting to hear. The song are boring, and she sound lifeless. Save your money."
2,Does not meet the hype by any means...............,"For those who are previous fans of Ms. Keys and potential buyers: please borrow the CD from a friend or listen to samples online before buying. The CD got a great review in People magazine, and I rushed to buy it just to find out that it was an ""average"" work of art. Even a touch below average. She may have succeeded in not making a total sophomore slump, but definitely not worth my dinero. Check it out before buying!"
2,The Clive Davis Formula Works,"Clive Davis is Good at finding Material for Artists He works with.you can tell He Pre-dated the Cult-Classic Film ""The Idol-Maker"".Alicia Keys is Vastly Overrated&Creates Soul Muzak Re-Makes&patches at best.Yeah She can Play but still ain't wrote One Original Song yet.Vocally She ain't gonna Scare Christina anytime soon nor Beyonce.some of the Material here is cool but when you hear what Monica is doing with Missy&also Ashanti's ""Rain On Me"" what exactly Seperates Alicia Keys from them but Her Piano Playing? Alicia has followed Mariah Carey&Mary J.BLiege's Blue-Print at taking Older Cuts&Re-dressing them up.Ak is trying to reach the depth that Lauyrn Hill had but it's not coming out Natural but Her&Clive have a Formula that works."
2,"Alicia, you tricked me","This cd was not worth the money at all. I bought it because her first cd was cool. I loved ""you don't know my name"", but the rest of the cd is not for me."
1,"Hey, Alicia, Does Proactiv Cover Up Lack of Talent?","It's too late for some people. This girl doesn't need your money anymore. She's sold out to Pro-Activ makeup to cover her blemishes. Too bad no amount of creme is going to cover up her total lack of talent. Message to the world: try listening to an album without watching the video first, you might not really like her music that much.Oh, one more thing: why in the world does she braid her hair in such irratic cornrows? You'd think she'd figure out how to cut a straight hedge. Oops, I forgot, she's more worried about her acne!!"
1,um....how bout no?,"i guess i heard a completely different version of this cd from the reviews these other folk are giving it. this mess was ridiculously bad. i really like alicia and i think she's really talented. her singles are great, but her cds sound like they were thrown together by a 12 year old in a garage. come on now, there are only three songs on the cd that i can actually bear to listen to, and they are, ""you dont know..."" (obviously, that song it just too perfect), ""if i aint got you"", and that secrets one is pretty nice. otherwise, it's garbage. (...). also, if you didnt like her first cd, you REALLY wont like this one...i coulda bought a sammich..."
1,Alicia can do a lot better.,She just didn't step up to the plate with this record. Maybe her first record set the bar too high.
1,Disappinted would be a nice word.,"I could go on to write a book about how this album fails, But I am not. I will simply say that I expected better material from Alicia."
1,This Album Sucks!,"To all of you people that like Alicia Keys out there, I'm sorry but the songs are all weak and the album cover is too. I liked the first album better. I hate Alicia Keys, she aint' sexy she just got beauty to her face and all of her music videos are boring she never dances or anything. Beyonce' is a real artist and won 6 grammy's she is also hottttt in every way. Beyonce' isn't boring either.All alicia keys does is play the stupid piano.Beyonce' is just better than alicia."
5,Miss Keys is It,"I love Alicia and this cd. To me it was alot better than her first. Her vocals are incredible and beats go great with the music. Alicia has all the class and talent of what a true R&B diva should be. If you want a touch of real music, then you need to add this to your collection. I feel Miss Keys has a long time coming, in the industry."
4,Not Her Best But Enjoyable to Say The Least!,"I liked the way the album flowed, but none of songs left a bullseye with me. I think that she needs to come more into her own and stay more orginal.(I want her just to go off on that piano and sing her ass off.) I want to remember a song not just remember a version. I read her diary and I'm still waiting to get to her secrets. We are still just scratching the surface. But its worth taking a look at."
4,Always a fan,"I love this CD. It is true some tracks sound a little familiar to her other album. But there are also some differences. I love the way she touched new beats. Her lyrics, for me are sweet and close to the heart. I also enjoyed the DVD. I had seen Ms. Keys a few months ago here in PR, she is aways a breath of fresh air."
3,The Diary is Missing a Few Pages,"Alicia Keys knows soul. With that there is no doubt. She knows how to conjure up deep emotions and evoke great feeling in both lyric and music. But this one question haunts me: ""Where is that on this record?!"" Make no mistake, Alicia is extremely talented. Her piano playing and writing are usually of the first rate. But it's when she tries to blend her classical influences with neo soul on this record that she fails.""You Don't Know My Name""- Grammy worthy. It made me excited to purchase the album. One fo the few true gems on the album, and does it ever shine. ""If I Was Your Woman"" is another tack on which the artist truly does shine. Gladys Knight would be proud! Wake up and So Simple are also tracks on which her craft is truly revealed. Yet the great songs are few and far between unlike it's beautifully crafted predecessor. One more word: rushed? -DLC"
4,good CD,"I own both of alicia keys records and as soon as I heard this album I loved it much better than her debut. In some ways it is much better than her debut but the debut album sounds more timeless than this one. Sure there are classic ballads with wonderful piano playing like you don't know my name, diary, if i was your girl and so on, but it sounds way to polished while with songs in a minor it just flows lightheartedly. I would still recommend this though cause it's one of the better r&b records to have come out in the last few years."
2,Didn't Like It.,"Alicia Keys's sophomore album suffers from the sophomore slump. Unlike the first album there was nothing I liked in this CD, the music, the lyrics, everything.Generally uninteresting and disappointing."
2,UM......... WHY DID SHE WIN BEST FEMALE R&B OF 2005 ON BET AWARDS,IM SO SORRY BUT IF I PLAYED THE PIANO AND SING ABOUT A MAN I NEED WOULD I GET A GRAMMY 2 LMAO. SHE IS ALRIGHT SHE IS OVERATTED AS WELL AS MARIAH CAREY'S LATEST ALBUM THEY BOTH ARE SOILD ALBUMS
1,SUCKED!,This is WAY TOO OVERRATED just like some smart people think. Alicia Keys thinks she is the best but just as bad if not worse than all these other r&B and popo singers out their making a fortune for petty work on AWFUL albums that many people buy for weird reasons! Listen to Billy Idol or some 80's music instead.
2,TO EMOTIONAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS CD IS GARBAGE,"First of all I respect Alicia's musical talents. But this album has BAD! writing and production. Its not consistent at ALL!It has a couple of tracks that are okay, but the rest is just wake. She gets to personal with the male bashing and stuff. This CD for WOMAN ONLY! to emotional for me."
1,Refund please...,"Two days after runnng to the store to get this CD and finding that I was buying 2 of the last 6 copies I practically danced to the car ripping the cellophane off as I went. Throwing Kem aside I anticipated being mesmorized on the drive home. I skipped the first song, fast forwarded through the second song, started worrying on song three and laughed at song four, If I was Your Woman...What happened to her voice? Is this music, or will it just make u sic?Save your money and have a good lunch."
1,What a waste of material........,"I am sorry.....Girl! absolutely no talent. The first track sounded like something off my grandmother's new Dolly Parton cd. Come on! There was no bling! bling! in this thing! thing! you know what i am sayin' she totally came off trying to be like Aretha Franklin....who I must say is the true soul sister....she is in my house..uh huh! uh huh! As I got toward the middle I was like yo dog what is that.....chick be soundin' like stankie toes. not to mention the attitude. trying to come off all hard. aretha could put her in her place any day....all she would have to do is stick out hand. this wanna be soul sister is washed up and should look at another career. really come on...how ironic she plays the piano and her last name is keys. peace out to the 10,000!"
4,It's allright,"3.5 stars. I know I'm going to be beat up by Ms. Keys fans, and from what I seen of Alicia in interviews and everything, I agree she has talent. But I've failed to be completely 'wowed' by her. I keep waiting. She's come close a couple of times but so far no dice. Don't get me wrong there are a ccouple of descent songs. ""You don't know my name"", for one and I'm amazed she won five grammys with this effort, but that just goes to show you that there are different strokes for different folks. Overall: Just okay."
5,Alicia,Alicia will not fail you as all of her CD's as excellent! This CD arrived on time and I was very happy with it and I still am.
3,"Good, dont pay more than $5-7 tho","I always love alicia keys still to this day- anxiously awaiting her new one. But some songs on this album sound too much alike i kinda regretted paying so much for it. Love the same titled song- my fave, as well as 1-2 more."
5,amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!,amazing A.K. has the talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Absolutely love this cd and all her beautiful Music. would her cd's any day. Music that make you heart happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good album,"from one of the most talented and potential artists around. It delivers some killer old-school rnb and soul music. Stand-out tracks are the single ""You don't know my name, If I ain't got you, Karma, her rendition of If I was your woman/walk on by, the great When you really love someone, Wake up, the catchy Samsonite man, the innovative ""Heartburn"".I think she's somewhat lacking in the lyric department, but other than that a solid album."
5,Can I Just Say THANK YOU???,"Alicia Keys... simply a genius in her own right. She finally gets what these other artists fail to see... IT'S OKAY TO GO ON A HIATUS TO MAKE A QUALITY CD...(NO NAMES NEEDED)But as far as this CD... it's WONDERFUL. My 57 year old grandmother loves this CD! It's timeless... When I first heard ""You Don't Know My Name,"" I thought it was an old Jackson 5 record (seriously). But when I realized who it was, I KNEW I had to have this in my collection! Congratulations..."
3,Diary - Good but not Dynamic,"This is a really good album. I would not say it is better than her first (which has some really amazing songs on it), but it is certainly worth purchasing. I have to agree with the other reviewer though, on the point that this album focuses mostly on the ups and downs of romantic relationships, not really on the ups and downs of life, which she did on her fist album (to her credit). The two albums are quite different in theme and style. ""Diary"" has more of an ""old school"" feel to it - ""You Don't Know My Name"" track #5 (the best track on the album to me) is the perfect example of the classic old school flow, as are ""If I Ain't Got You"" and ""Wake up"". This new direction suits Alicia, but this album lacks that certain ""umph"" that was so evident in the first. All-in-all, it's good - just not dynamic."
4,Brittney Who?,"I can't believe people are dumb enough to say that Brittney ""No Talent"" Spears can even try and be on the same level as Ms. Alicia Keys. Alicia Keys won more Grammys for her first CD than Brittney has won all together. This CD is tight and it just excells Ms. Keys Skillz higher and higher this CD is worth bying instead of just downloading."
4,Did it again,"Well let's just say some singers know harmony and Keys is one of them. This CD is a good, I give it a B+, Songs in A Minor was an A, simple because all the songs on A Minor were geat. On this CD there are maybe 2 songs that should of been left off and two interludes that should of been made into full songs, just my opinion. Alicia sings with so much soul and harmony, while listening, before you know it the CD has ended and you are like wow.Stand Out songs:Harlem's NocturneKarmaHeartburnIf I Was Your Woman / Walk On ByYou Don't Know My NameIf I Ain't Got YouDiaryWhen You Really Love SomeoneFeeling U, Feeling Me - (interlude)Slow DownSamsonite ManNobody Not Really - (interlude)Kind of disappointed the "" Streets Of New York "" was not includes as a bonus track...Please stay away from the likes of Mr. P. Diddy, when it comes to production.Overall I'd say cop the CD, you can't go wrong with her passionate style of singing."
5,A Classic Worth Waiting For,"For R&B;, this is a CLASSIC. Alicia's latest effort is better than SIAM. This CD shows a lot of growth and potential. This is R&B; in it's purest form, or as close as you're going to get from a contemporary artist. Most of her peers are closer to Hip-Hop than Aretha Franklin or Stevie Wonder.I'm almost 30 and I was fortunate to see Sammy Davis Jr. Live when he came to Detroit. So I can definitely appreciate Alicia's direction with this album. I remember Marvin Gaye, and that sound is exactly what we're missing from this generation of R&B; recording artists. Alicia is helping to fill that void, but there aren't a lot of others like her.Please open your eyes and ears and give Alicia's new CD a chance. Her CD is more modern, but it feels timeless. She really does have a lot of talent. I just hope one day we will learn to recognize those with truly unique gifts."
4,wow,"after listening to alicia keys debut, i was completely impressed with her many wonderful talents. finally a true artist who sang (and i mean SANG!) about things that mattered and touched people. so, i knew alicia wouldnt dissapoint this time around. but weather or not she could top SONGS IN A MINOR was the question. i must say wow, im in love with this album. personally, i havent heard an album this great since THE MISEDUCATION OF LAURYN HILL. THE DIARY OF ALICIA KEYS is amazing!"
2,It's ok,"I had very high hopes with regards to this cd, especially after hearing her stellar first single ""You Don't Know My Name"", but upon receiving and listening to it, I don't really like it. It's painfully boring to me, even though it has some nice songs on it. Songs In A Minor was a much better cd."
3,An Interesting Read,"I'm no expert in this period of history, I have an understanding of the cultures and countries involved and as such I enjoyed this book very much. I have read an earlier book by this author 'The Celtic Empire' which I thought was a well written and presented account of the Celtic people. This led me to purchase this book and I will more than likely buy his latest account of the Celts titled 'Celt & Roman'.In this book the author covers the Celts during the period of the time when Greece and Rome were the dominate players in the ancient world. Its an enjoyable read and I learnt a few things on the journey. The book covers their social background and inter-action with other people along with their military campaigns against the Greeks and Romans and their occassional mercenary role in the ancient armies. The author does not go into excessive detail but certainly provides the facts as he knows them and tells a good story in the process."
1,CREEPY,"My daughter brought this home from the library at school. It's creepy. I'm sorry -- but I've always considered the berenstain bears safe for kids. However, this book talks about a bully gang and a girl who has a crush on a male teacher and invites him over without her parents' permission. I was reading this to my daughter, who brought it home from the school library, and had to stop! What the heck! It was awful and inappropriate. Find another book."
3,Not his best,"I'm a real Bruce Coville fan, and this book was a disappointment for me. I don't know exactly why I disliked it so much, but I did. I think it might of had something to do with the characters. Bonnie, the heroine, is a little slow and just not that likable. Also this book focused allot on future telling and things like that, and I have this thing against that type of stuff. I sure that lots of people will enjoy this book, but I felt like sharing my opinion with the world. If you were thinking of buying this book, don't let this review stop you."
3,Over simplified,Good CD but chill does not go with Rachmaninov. The man is romantic. Let's change the title to In Love with Rachmaninov.
4,Car-Go Fun,"I was excited to receive this dvd for a long car trip my family and I were taking. When the kids opened it and put it in, I was curious about how long it would actually entertain the kids because it said up to 1 hr.My oldest son, 10, played for about 15 minutes and was bored, but he helped my younger daughters play for maybe another 15 min. So it was fun, but for a 19 hr car trip, it really didn't do a whole lot for us. So overall, it didn't have enough on it to entertain even my older son for a long enough period of time, but it would be great for short trips."
1,Definately not for older kids...,"I thought this would be a cool thing for a 1st grader who loves Sponge Bobbut, it's really for the Sesame Street, preschool age child. What a waste."
4,Very good singing,"This opera doesn't have a lot of action but it does have great tunes - one after another, and this makes a nice audio recording to listen to over and over. Susan Dunn is an exceptional soprano with a beautiful, powerful, flexible voice - what more could one ask for? Vincenzo La Scola is a good silvery-toned tenor with reliable high notes. Bruson's singing is touching as always. Dunn and La Scola are more of your 'stand and deliver'-type singers - not great actors, so with the lack of action in the opera, I do not give the video a full five stars."
2,Great system?,"I bought this DVD Home Theater system a few months ago. It's not too expensive but then again it's very heavy and large and not well designed at all. So If you want it to look good DO NOT BUY THIS.Another problem I had with my DV-115 is that the DVD's I play always have a ""break"" in them. This may be due to the changing layers but I feel there are often more ""breaks"" and at different moments in the disc.Also at regular intervals my players starts to slow down. The picture and sound slow down, become slurred and that isn't a problem with the discs because changing discs doesn't help at all.So WHEN it works it's a great (albeit quite large) system, but I can't rely on it to work properly..."
1,only 2 years old and the DVD player is already dead,"I purchased this system in Jan. 2002. It is now Jun 2004. The DVD player no longer works. Also the system always had an annoying habit of producing loud ""pops"" during DVD playback along with visual stutters. I will not buy from Daewoo again."
2,Software para convertir videos caseros,"El equipo bueno, pero he tratado de convertir algunos videos caseros a los formatos que puede reproducir el DVD (SVCD, VCD, etc) con software comercial y no ha sido posible. Si alguien conoce el software que funcione para convertir los videos les agradezco."
5,very nearly the best album of an entire decade,"these thirteen songs of destruction, dereliction, and depression are more powerful than any other collection of a generation. raw, swollen: listen to this album some twenty times and then read the lyrics on the twentyfirst time through. these people aren't shock-rockers, they're being honest and evoking a response infinitely greater than those pop-punk rockstars. so unfortunate that this is the last work of all four members. and unfortunate that more people never caught on when they had the oppurtunity."
5,The best album I know...,"This is the best album I know. This is Yesterday, IfWhiteAmerica, Faster, She Is Suffering, Revol, PCP... You do not know music if you do not know this album. This Is My Truth, Everything Must Go, Know Your Enemy, Gold Against The Soul, Generation Terrorists are also very exceptional. But this one rules. Have it!"
5,IMMENSE,"The best album of the 90's, possibly the best album ever. All 13 tracks are brilliant with Yes, Of Walking Abortion, Mausoleum, this is Yesterday and Die in the Summertime really standing out. This album shows why Nicky wire and Richie Edwards are one of the best songwriting partnerships ever, not too far behind Lennon and McCartney. The lyrics are pure genius, the music is intense and mixing them two together gives a masterpeice."
2,I don't understand why people rave over this,"There are some creative things on here, granted. But I've listened to the album many times now and I just don't get it. It really doesn't deserve all the fanfare, because so many other rock / punk bands do it much better. The album doesn't really blend well either, the songs are really disjointed like its a mix of two or three different bands. I was not impressed, would rather listen to Stone Roses, Blur or another band with some real skill or creativity."
1,Try Oasis instead,"This album is not much of an album at all. It's scattered lyrics are so incoherent that they are a perfect compliment to the horrible instrumentation. This album is barely listenable, and it is far too dark for anyone who wishes to stay sane to listen to repeatedly."
5,The music god gives his verdict.....,"I really can't be arsed to write a huge essay about the merits of this album so i'll sum up quickly..... the lyrics are astoundingly disturbing but excellent, the music is astoundingly disturbing but excellent as well, in fact, this album is very good - whoever gave this 1 star obviously hasn't got a soul."
5,A strange album to say the least.,"Despite all the ""real"" people harping on about the meaning and the anti right wing, socialistic tendancies that the Manic Street Preachers have. They seldom mention that they are a band with perhaps the greatest sense of tune in history. The mindset that makes songs such as 4st7lbs and P.C.P, where the lyrics are virually impossible to sing, some of the best and bounciest songs on what is to be honest a pretty understated album. There is of course the inevitable punk classic in Faster where the Manics head straight back to their roots, name dropping and creating vocal solos that are breathtaking. One last thing, BRITAIN NEEDS THE MANICS!"
4,holy bible; the 1994 AD version,"the ultimate aim for all people should be the truth, and this album holds the truth in abundance. if deep songs and genius guitar is your idea of a chilled evening in with a spliff, or your cat; then buy this. this was the last of the manics albums i bought, and to be honest, in theory, is the best....(i have to admit my favourite is the most popularised... EVERYTHING MUST GO). some of the songs are too wordy and lack a certain musical twang, but then you could always mosh to the rest of it. the highlights for me (offical type review people are so far up their own arses they forget about individual taste) are...YES, SHE IS SUFFERING, REVOL, FASTER, THIS IS YESTERDAY, and DIE IN THE SUMMERTIME."
5,Sheer Brilliance,"The best album ever in my opinion. Beautiful music mixed with breathtaking lyrics. James Dean Bradfield is one of the few men in rock that can actually sing. Richey James Edwards and Nicky Wire wrote some of the greatest lyrics ever. Of course, Sean Moore does some great drumming and co-writing of the songs. Not a bad song on here. Some of the gems are 4St 7lbs, She Is Suffering, Archives of Pain and Of Walking Abortion."
4,HARROWING AND UNFORGETTABLE,"When I first bought this CD, I was disappointed. My first exposure to MSP was Everything Must Go, a brilliant, beautiful album. I thought this one to be inferior. While I still prefer Everything, I have come to love this record. Desensitizing and polarizing at the same time, it is a relentless trip through the atrocities and tragedies of the world, past and present. By themselves, each song may come off as pseudo-political rantings by a sophomore band, but I don't think this album was ever meant to be heard a cut at a time. Together it blends into a powerful, disturbing and yet highly energizing and melodic triumph. I highly recommend this record. Give it some time. If you are not immediately taken by it, after repeated listenings, you will be."
5,Pretentious title - lives up to its bold claim,"This is the Manics' signature album and one of the most underrated masterpieces in the wider pop music world.The presumptuous title is more than backed up by the content.The existential lyrics are just as powerful and evocative as the music itself.Insightful, profound.The pick of the bunch for me are - 'Yes', '4st 7lb', 'Mausoleum', 'Faster' and 'PCP' although all the songs are top notch.The only Manics album that definitely contains no radio-friendly tunes yet their best.""In these plagued streets of pity you can buy anything"""
5,A Dark Disturbing Masterpiece,"The Manic Street Preachers final album with Richey Edwards is probably THE greatest ever recorded. It is a dark disturbing view into the mind of one of the most talented lyricists ever. Richey Edwards vanished a few months after its release. On the 1st of February 2000 he will have been missing for 5 Years, despite this the 3 remaining Manics have gone from strenght to strenght selling millions of records in the proccess. Songs like Yes, Mausoleum and PCP are damning verdicts on modern day life.Thought the main track is 4st 7lbs, a heart-achingly beautiful song about a girl with an eating disorder which Richey is actually believed to have written about his own anorexic problems faintly hiden behind a 2nd person narrative. This record was a turning point in the Manics career and many fans lives."
5,Beautiful!!!,I ordered these for our wedding reception and they were perfect. They are even prettier in reality (pictures do not do it justice).
3,Marvin,This is not a book for someone who has a casual or marginal knowledge of military history. I'm retired military myself and i had to go back and research the history of the Normandy invasion to grasp and appreciate what the author is trying to get across. In my opinion the author seems to assume the reader has just a good of a knowledge of the Normandy invasion as he has; which he apparently has an in-depth knowledge of. The story would be much more appealing if the author had spent a chapter or two at the front informing us of what happened; then telling us what could have happened.
4,That fat guy from HEAD OF THE CLASS sure can write!,"This spin-off of Nickelodeon's ALL THAT, starring Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, is a pretty funny movie. It can drag at times, but there are quite a few good bits, and the interaction between Keenan and Kel is great. Plus, it co-stars both Abe Vigoda AND the fat guy from HEAD OF THE CLASS (who also co-wrote)! What more could you possibly want in a movie?"
3,Good Burger silly but fun,"If you're looking for intellectual stimulating theater, this is definitely not the film to choose. If you want an incredibly silly, funny, and perhaps a bit stupid light-hearted movie, this is the one to watch. My 10 and 14 year old kids laughed the entire length of the film. There's no violence, nudity or sex; it's a great film for preteens and teens."
4,My traditional start-of-summer movie,"This is an underrated movie that never gets old. Kenan and Kel play Dexter, an irratable high school student in debt, and Ed, a dim-witted but lovable dude who loves his job a little too much. They are a sort of reverse Abbott and Costello. The two must save Good Burger from Mondo Burger, a Dave and Busters-esque new restaurant across the street and its successful but cruel manager Kurt, who always refers to himself in the third person. Along the way, they both learn a thing or two about being friends and partners."
4,I miss Kenan and Kel!,"I love this movie, not a blockbuster by any stretch but a really fun family movie with lots of laughs! Sure makes me long for the old Nikelodeon days . . ."
3,Okay but not as funny as the Kenan and Kel show.,"I recently purchased this movie thinking it would be as hilarious as their show Kenan and Kel. Although the movie did have some funny parts, I felt like the Kenan and Kel show was a lot funnier. I was kind of dissappointed with the movie but I think it's because I had really high exceptions of it, being it was two hilarious people such as Kenan and Kel playing the parts."
3,"happy, and disappointed","I just recieved the Good Burger DVD, and as much as I love this movie, I was so disappointed because I watched it, then watched it, and the video at the same time, and I saw that, with the widescreen ratio, it looks like they added a little bit on the side of it, and just put black bars and the top and bottom of the screen. For example, at the beginning when you see ed floating in the middle of the screen, and the burgers flying around him, on the video, you completely see all the burgers, nothing is cut off the burgers, but on the DVD, you dont see all the burgers, when they get to the top, the top half is cut off, and on the bottom, the bottom half is cut off, but that only happens at some scenes, others look like the video was formatted, not the DVD. Also, another disappointed, there was no special features, i understand that this movie out in 1996, but they could at least put eh trailer and ""cast and crew"" on there. Other than that, the movie was great."
2,Damaged goods,"When I bought the dvd, I knew it was used, but it was also damaged. Near the end of the movie there are several glitches and interrupted parts probably due to scratches. If I had known it was damaged I would not have bought it."
5,~One Good Burger Please!~,This movie is the bomb. Dexter Gets into a car accident in his mom's car right after summmer vacation and his mom did not let him use the car! And guess what? The car he crashed into was his teacher's and now he has to pay for his teacher's car. Will he get the money? Will he get half? Will he get None and just keep it for himself? You gotta watch the movie to find out!!
5,5 and a half stars!,My mom and I were rolling the first time we watched this movie! And the 2nd and the 3rd... I've watched at least 19 times and I still love it! GET THIS!
3,"Amazing movie, Boring DVD","I've loved this movie ever since I was a little kid, and I had the VHS. When I got the DVD I was really excited because I hoped there would be some entertaining bonus material to watch, behind the scenes and that stuff. So, I was pretty disappointed to find out that the DVD has absolutely NO special features. The DVD main menu is just the same picture that is on the DVD cover with three options, Play, Set Up and Scene Selection. No music, nothing but a picture. All the menus are like this. You would just be better off buying a digital download instead of buying this DVD because there's nothing on it but a movie and some ghetto-ass menus. I'm really hoping someday Paramount will come out with a new ""collector's edition"" DVD/Blu Ray.Movie: 10/10DVD: 2/10"
3,Good Burger,"My grandson is 5 years old. He saw this movie on Nickelodeon and loved it. He asked if I could get a copy for him. He knows everyone's part in the script (glad the dialogue is clean) In todays market it is so hard to find a film for kids without profanity. So although it is a little silly to me he can relate to them as a child. It also helps him keep up with the members of the cast, as most of them have gone on to get their own shows on Disney or Nick."
3,Good movie,"i liked this movie cause from where im heading, the only phrases i will know will be "" do you want fries with that""? lol"
1,Wrong Language!,"I was sent the French version of this movie. Because we don't speak French, we can't watch it and don't wish to read it. The advertised version doesn't state it, but our copy says ""Version francaise"" right on the cover. It may have English included, but I'm not opening the package to find out. Expect to see it back to you soon."
2,"It should be titled ""Okay Burger""","I got this movie for my 10 year old daughter who really likes it. If your getting this for kids then it's probably worth it. Just don't pay too much!!! About a week after I ordered this movie, I saw it in the bargain bin of a local store for $5...!Lots of silly stuff but not so much funny stuff."
2,CD,This was for my son and he wanted a cd not a cassette tape. Eventhough he enjoys the music he wanted a cd
1,goodburger,used to watch this as a kid so i wanted to relive it.....wow what was i thinking. haha no its funny just i liked it more as a youngster
1,Wrong version of song!!!,"I am more of a film score fan, so I very rarely listen to songs. However, I became very fond of the song, ""Do Fries Go With That Shake?"" that underscored Ed rollerblading to work at the beginning. It was the ONE and ONLY reason I bought this album. Well, it was on there alright, but it was the wrong version! It was sung by a different group, played with different instruments. I would assume there is a good reason for this, like maybe the song was changed at the last minute.I wish they had made a little ""Different Version Contained In Film"" notice on the back. As for the rest of the songs, they are pretty much the way they were in the film, if I remember correctly. I hated the thing so much, I gave it away."
1,"look,....up there ^ its less than jake!","aww man i just found out that ""im a dude, you're a dude"" song is by less than jake! how could they stoop so low as to make a song for a nickelodeon movie, expecially this one, and especially that brainless ramble they call a song. i must say i am very disapointed in less than jake."
4,A big bunch of Brain Puzzlers!,"This is a book full of brain teasers, all for ages 8-12. There are three sections: Brain Warm-Ups, Brain Workouts and Brain Challenges. Each section is broken up into different areas of curriculum: Math, Word Activities, Writing, and Creative Thinking and is 101 pages long. The book is over 300 pages long and includes progress charts and an answer key. This would make a great addition to any curriculum!"
3,Little Blue Gem,"Drummer-singer Dixon produces a modest and entertaining session here. Lyrically it's not too deep, but that doesn't really matter;The blues/r&b; feeling is there. She has a no-nonsense drumming style short on solos and when the mood calls for it, her voice has a sweet-tart, plaintive quality a little reminiscent of the late Esther Phillips. Standout tracks are ""Searching For My Love,"" with Mike Merritt's warm bass tones and some pseudo-Motown shadings courtesy of the Vivino brothers' harmony singing. An Elmore James cover, ""Baby Please Set A Date"" shows what she can do with a good quality Blues tune.I don't know if Dixon is still active;Hearing her live would be likely be a treat."
4,"Sexy, Young Images by Lalli","Lalli has captured some very young & sexy men in this images. These very handsome guys are shown in natural poses, doing everyday things. There are a few nude images included. The models seem to enjoy themselves posing for the photographer. You can tell Lalli has a good relationship with those he photographs. This book is number 17 in the Euros Series. It's a definite book for your collection. I hope there are more books issued in the future showcasing the new photographers. These Euros Edition Series books were beautifully designed and the quality & binding is also excellent, thanks to the publisher Bruno Gmunder. Let's hope there is more on the way!!!!!!"
2,Beware -- this isn't the Smash original,"Although they're both called ""Golden Hits"", this is not the Smash Records album with a different cover. These are totally different recordings. Even the track listing is different (this includes ""Husbands And Wives"" but not ""Atta Boy Girl"" or ""One Dying and A Burying""). I'm not a Roger Miller expert, so don't know the background or history. They are quality recordings, and the backing & arrangements closely mirror the originals, but the Smash release is completely different than this. Caveat emptor!"
1,Sub-Par Re-recordings,"As another reviewer stated, these are not the original recordings, nor--in my humble opinion--are they anywhere near the quality of the originals. If you like Roger Miller, these may have novelty value, but not much else. Spend a few more dollars and get an ""authorized"" collection.BEWARE the ""Masters"" record label!"
5,Roger Miller Golden Hits,"Roger Miller's music is from the 50's, but he still connects with people today. His King of the Road is timeless."
4,happy happy,"I purchased this CD so that I could listen to something jolly in the car, and it fulfils this need admirably. Perhaps not as manic as some of the versions of Vivaldi recorder music I have heard, but pretty fired up nonetheless. I challenge anyone to feel down when they listen to this."
5,I'll B Back!!!,Ordered the highlighted CD by Gerald Albright...received product in about 5 days.....EXTRA SATISFIED!! Considering the price I paid and the short time span that lapsed until I was listening to it... Will be back to Amazon.com in very near future.
2,Great saxophonist ----- Bad cd...,"I have all of gerald albright's cd's He is a great sax player and all of his other cd's are great. But this one seemed like there was not as much effort put into it. if you like gerald albright get his cd ""Giving Myself To You"" or "" kickin it up"" this one does not show his real sax playing."
3,"It's Okay, But Unfortunately, Not All That","I have always enjoyed Gerald Albright. Truth be told, he is probably a better session man than one who warrants a solo outing each and every time. While an acoomplished insturmentalist in his own right, he has always paled in the light of other notable sax players like, say Kirk Whalum. While this is listenable, you definitely want more than that. But the standout cuts here would be the title track and the last one ""We Fall Down."" Very inspiring but certainly not enough to justify a debut on such an auspicious label as GRP. I am glad, however, that they have confidence in him to do better because he most certainly will have to in order to sustain much interest in his work. Sorry, Gerald."
5,Nice one.,"I liked this one, of course I'm a jazzter anyway. Very smooth, along with that R&B touch. I like them all. My favorites are: ""Change the world"" Originally done by ""Eric Clapton."" And also, ""We fall down,"" Origianlly done by ""Donnie Mc clurkin"" These are all very good pieces, and deserve to be heard."
1,Not authentic / US version,"Seller sent an EU version with a different case than the one pictures (seen elsewhere with a gold ""Best Seller SERIES"" label). Nowhere on this Warcraft III Frozen Throne product page do I see it mentioned that it's the UK version. In the seller's feedback they have been doing the same thing on several games. On other games they have a brief ""Uk ver"" blurb buried in some text about the packaging. Be careful buying from 3rd parties on Amazon, too many of the 3rd party sellers pull shady tricks like this, especially if the prices is abnormally low compared to the more official looking product listing."
1,expansion??,"i bought this game for my husband thinking it was just the game, because no where does it say it's an expansion to Warcraft III or that you need the full version of Warcraft III to play it. We were very upset when it got here and it said Expansion pack on the cover. The description should be more precise. He's has played this game before and loves it, it's a great game!! Can anyone tell me if the Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is the full version of Warcraft III???"
5,"very descriptive, good for amateurs",i've had this book for two days and i love it. it truly inspires me. its easy to read and the fragrant recipes are simple and inexpensive to make. i created my first dried floral arrangement and i was amazed with the results. i love to walk into a room and be surrounded by pretty flowers and nice aromas. you can definitely achieve that with the help of this book. enjoy!
5,Great recipes,"Nice collection of recipes for potpourri and sachets. Some ofthe ingredients are tough to find but I found most via the internet for the couple I've tried so far. Last half of the book is on flower drying, arraging and wreaths - not really my thing but I really enjoyed the first half."
2,Not Great,The heads on this product do not work that great. I would recommend the Tweezerman black head remover over this. The two different head shapes are much more effective.
2,Ok product.,"I usually use biore pore strips but decided to try something else to reduce the expenses. Biore pore strips cost over $1 for each strip. Anyway, I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try based on the reviews.The product works ok. It doesn't work for certain tough to reach areas of the nose which is where most of my blackheads are and it doesn't work as well for the smaller blackheads. I'll use it but I prefer to stick to biore pore strips."
3,so-so,"It was dlivered just in time, but as I aws using it for the first time in my life, inspired by reviews here, it was not all that easy to use.I don't send it back but it obviously not the first choice in the battle with blackheads."
5,Simple product,This is just a very clean way of cleaning your face. I do love it and it came with 2 so I gave one to a friend and she also loved it
3,Might work for you,"i used this to get rid of my black heads and while it did get some gunk out it wasnt the best, solution to my problem but tottally worth the price!so give it a try may work for you!"
2,Kind of a pain,I bought this because I have stubborn blackheads on my nose that wont seem to go away no matter how many biore strips I use or how many steam facials I do. But it didnt work for me. I followed the instructions and it just made my nose red and sore and didnt do anything. I may not be doing it right though.
1,Don't waste your money,"I don't have a very bad acne problem, just a couple of blackheads, and the occasional pimple, so I thought that this tool would be a good bet. Wrong. First, you can't center your smaller blemishes under the opening, because you can't SEE them through the hole. Then, when you finally find the right spot, press down, all I got was a big red spot with the pimple still in the middle. I didn't press too hard, my pores were sufficiently open, and the blemish was ""ripe"" so to speak. This thing just doesn't work."
1,Hate It,I tried this tool and ended up with bruised skin and the same old blackheads. It is a waste of money. Try Sephora's extracting tool for results.
2,New design no improvement,"I was glad to finally find the Revlon Blackhead remover again. I had used it back in the 90's when it was available in retail stores. The old design had a funnel shape and was excellent at removing blackheads. The new design is too flat to remove anything. It causes swelling and doesn't make the blackhead pop out, or even rise to the surface. I am disappointed that they changed the design and made it inefficient."
2,Leaves red circles,"This blackhead remover works well on pores in hard to reach places, like the crease of your nose, but I couldn't get it to work anywhere else. All it did was leave red circles on my cheeks and nose. I still use it for those hard to reach pores around my nose, but it doesn't work for open or fleshy areas."
5,best product ever,I cannot say how much I love this product!!!!! I have bought soooo many other blackhead removers and this one by far is the best!!!!! I cannot live without this thing!!!!!
5,It works,I have used revlon's blackhead remover for years and it's the only thing that has worked for me. My face doesn't turn red so I think maybe some of you are pressing too hard.
5,The Archies / Everything's Archie,"OMG, nothing like taking you back in time. My parents bought me this album when I was 9, back when it came out in 1969. I loved all the songs on this album. I have been hunting for THIS album in a CD & found it (THANK YOU TV4U). There were a lot of other ""Archie"" CD's but I couldn't find this one in particular. But thanx to Ron Dante & his amazing voice has remade the originial ""Everything's Archie"" album. From the first song ""Feel So Good, Skooby Doo"" to the last song ""Love Light"" it is totally GREAT. Funny thing is while listening to this CD I sang the songs with the ""skips"" from my album, it was funny. My ""childhood music"" is complete now. I have all my Monkees, Bobby Sherman, David Cassidy, & now Everything's Archie albums in CD form & I don't have to sing with the skips. Thanx again !!"
4,Sugar Sugar is still a great song,"I loved the Archies album when I was a kid and was very happy to get this CD with those old songs on it. Some of the songs are just bubble gum corny, but I still loved hearing them again. And some of them are actually very good! Get it for the memories and have fun!"
5,confessions of a gynecologist,"written in a flowing and exciting style ala ""Harold Robbins,"" the story is mesmerizing from start to finish. Revelations are harsh and uncompromising as the flaws in American medicine are exposed. You are left with the understanding that there is tremendous room for improvement in our training of physicians and our medical system as a whole."
2,"Boring, but instigating","I think that PKD is the most fantastic sfi-fi writer I've ever read. Notwithstanding, after reading masterpieces from him such as Divine Invasion, UBIK and others, I must say that I was pretty disappointed with VALIS. First of all, the book's first 120 pages are extremely redundant, with a collection of loose thoughts splashed and repeated ad nauseam. The things only heat after Dick's friend Kevin takes him to see the movie Valis. If you can reach this part (and many people couldn't), you will get some PKD's flavor. Some very interesting points are posed by him, what provoked on me a lot of reflection about life, religion. After reaching the end of the book I kept the impression that something was still missing and that costed VALIS the third star."
1,Phillip K. Dick's theological morass,"I am a huge fan of Dick's work, from Solar Lottery to Ubik. I feel he was a great genius. However, this seems to be less of a novel than a collection of his theological musings hurriedly injected into a thin ""story."" I expect better than long rambling (and disjointed) musings on the nature of a ""higher being."" Neither The Divine Invasion nor the Transmigration of Timothy Archer suffer from a lack of plot, despite being theosophical in nature, so it was with great anticipation that I purchased this book. A little more story, and little less discourse, could have made this into an interesting read. If you are a fan of Dick's, or good writing, try almost anything else by him, with the additional exception of ""Mary and the Giant,"" which is still better than this one."
1,I couldn't get into it,"I really love PKD. A Scanner Darkly is one of my absolute favorite novels, and I've enjoyed everything else I've read by him (though some of his short fiction is a little weak), but I just couldn't get into this book because of the writing style. I get why he wrote the way he did, all disjointed and surreal/postmodernistic, since it is a story of mental illness, addiction, theology, paranoia, conspiracy, and philosophy. But I've never been able to get into this style of writing (I really tried to read Burroughs). I need more of a storyline or at least something more linear."
5,The ultimate masterpiece in sci-fi,"Despite the headline, I'm rather unwilling to classify this book as science fiction. It's not a vision of what will be; it's a vision of what could be. The ultimate reality-blender also; Philip K. Dick always understood that greatest fantasy has a certain sense of reality that makes you almost believe in it. If this is not enough, then there are his amazing ideas of religion and metaphysics. One of the most intelligent and civilized books I've ever read, and at the same time, entertaining and funny too. The best work of a genius."
5,A Beautiful Mind,"This book was borrowed from a co-worker and after I read it I immediately bought it. There is so much I want to go back and research. Luckily, I had some knowledge about the Occult, Gnosticism, Philosophy and so on so there was much in this book that made me smile. It was like finding that strange friend that ""gets it."" Yes, you certainly have to be a little crazy to understand how PKD's mind works, but if you're not a little crazy or curious about the world around you then you probably won't come across this book anyway. This book is beyond original in the way it is laid out and how the story is told, and if you know anything about PKD's real life you will see a lot of his true story told through this book in an adventure through symbolism and archtypes. I highly suggest you keep a laptop near you while reading this book as there are many references that are fun to explore, and lead to vast amounts of knowledge that just may help connect the dots - unless you're too sane."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,"If you care to think, this is the one. I loved this book and plan on reading it over several times. Thanks."
2,wrong book description for Valis mass paper back,"When you look up the book under this listing, it is listed together with other print versions, which actully have three novels together but not this paperback! So you will end paying for one novel not three. Just keep that in mind! This is not to say that the actual novel Valis is ineed of PKD's best! It is just somewhat disingenious marketing either by Amazon or by the book seller, who does not specify the actual content."
5,postmodern prophecy,"If the canon of the Bible had not been prematurely closed (as if God has really stopped talking to people? ), Valis would surely take its place amongst its pages. Very few modern people could qualify as a prophet, and PKD stands among them. Valis is essentially autobiography -- though, since Dick is a master at questioning What is real? -- he never does decide exactly what happened to him. He knows how easily imagination can distort our view of reality. Nonetheless, some kind of profound experience radically changed his way of thinking, and made him wonder if -- in some sense -- the Roman empire never ended, and all of our reality is a sham, waiting for God to once again intervene. When you look at the sad state of what passes for Christianity these days, it's hard not believe that PKD was on to something.If you're a fan of Valis, be sure to look into Tod Machover's electronic opera based upon it, in the classical music area."
1,Wrong Picture Posted,"The cover for this book on the page would lead one to believe that it comes with two other works, and the book preview would lead you to believe the same. However this is ONLY VALIS. Don't buy this if you're expecting all three.On a brighter note, this is a very sturdy copy for a well priced paperback."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Some of the reviews of Dick's work gave me pause for thought but I bought Valis anyway given how inexpensive it was. Well, I should have listened to my little inner voice telling me ""This is not your type of book.""The writing is excellent but the topic and characters are so odd that I quit after about 60 pages. The dialog between the two personalities inhabiting a single body grows very tiresome. Perhaps if you are REALLY into metaphysical ramblings you'll like this (it's very well done and actually a bit witty) but for me it just wasn't worth the investment in time."
2,Rambling and Insane,"Smarties and good friends have recommended this book to me. However, halfway through it I had to simply give up and admit defeat. Nothing makes any sense, the characters are only warped peices of their true selves as seen by the main lunatic--er, character. The religious stuff was the most irreligious rambling I've ever run across, and it usurped the space in which a plot might have neatly fit. In short, I didn't get it, and I think I probably wouldn't want to anyway. This is not so much speculative fiction as it is something which causes you to speculate about whether it should even be called fiction."
2,Not as good as you might think,"I have read many books like this and it really isn't that good. Dick tries to hard to be funny and metaphysical at the same time. Probably a good book if you're a college student or just getting into examining your ""self"" and the universe, but believ me there are better books. His writing is an easy read though."
1,Uhh...,"That was my reaction, anyway. David Pringle (editor of Interzone) listed 6 (more than any other author)Dick novels in his book Science Fiction: the 100 Best Novels. He said he considered putting this one in there, too, but many people considered it unreadable. Count me in on that one. Everyone seems to just love this book, but I forced my way to page 25, and then had to stop. It was so boring, stupid, and weird, I just couldn't get into it."
4,An excellent guide for a beginner or student,"The DK series of books seem targeted for younger readers, and Bryan Magee's comprehensive guide to philosophers throughout history is no exception. There is little text and many illustrations and photographs. It is a bit simplistic for those who've studied philosophy, but for a new student or someone who wants a generalized account of the history of philosophical thought, it's a good book."
2,avoid paperback edition,"I had seen a copy of this book prior to purchase in an older edition. I liked it very much. It contains a lot of useful information laid out in a very readable fashion; however, I purchased a paperback copy. That was a big mistake! The type in the paperback edition is tiny. Reading this edition is difficult, and a lot of the impact of the creative layout is lost with the small pages. In retrospect, I would seek a larger format than the edition that measures 8.9 x 7.3 x 0.7 inches."
3,Bought this for my son,"My son liked it but didn't say much more about it. He's a philosophy buff and learned some stuff from it, though."
2,"Yes, I Believe You are a Fan Now ACTION!","If you have or are now considering buying this record then I beleive you are a real fanatic when it comes to Aerosmith. Either that or some kind of ""Gonzo"" nut. When Brad Whitford left A.Smith back in '82 or was it late '81 this is the main project he embarked on. The record rocks alright but with no production to speak of. It got squashed immediatly upon release and probably had no real radio material on it anyway. Brad is a very good guitar player and Derek St.Holmes is a great vocalists but neither of them could make it on their own and unfortunetly together either. If you have to complete your Aerosmith collection get it but otherwise don't bother."
3,AN EARLY BOOK ON OPEN RELATIONSHIPS,"Ronald MazurThe New Intimacy:Open-Ended Marriage and Alternative Lifestyles(Boston: Beacon Press, 1973) 134 pagesA brief but comprehensive bookdealing with all dimensions of open relationships:varieties of non-traditional relationships; changing social expectations;relatives, colleagues, & friends; children;sexual and sensual problems; pregnancy and STDs;jealousy and possessiveness; communication and honesty;moral and religious problems; homosexual relationships;ending relationships; divorce and divorce-reform.This is a book of theory rather than practice.The author believed we were about to entera new age of ""open-ended marriage"".Even tho no major shifts have occurred,his careful thinking about multiple relationships is still worth reading.Search the Internet for similar books:""Multiple Loving Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, author ofNew Ways of Loving: How Authenticity Transforms Relationships."
3,Not really much of a secret,"Firstly let me say I have a lot of respect for Thom Hartmann. The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight is a classic. This is a departure from his previous work, as it's his first novel. However, I would recommend other readers start with his other work first. If you're into spiritual novels, then other classics like Celestine Prophecy (Redfield), Siddhartha (Hesse), Illusions (Richard Bach), The Alchemist (Coelho) or Peaceful Journey (Millman) are more highly recommended and great places to start.As a novel, it's flat, the characterisation is abysmal, the writing is mediocre and unbelievable, the story weak, the spiritual ""secret"" not really a secret at all. Overall a disappointing work."
4,An interesting tale with plenty of food for thought.,Who is enlightened? Could the messiah be found among a group of homeless people in NY city's underground? A fascinating premise ably executed.
4,Definitely worth a look,"I would call this book spirituality from a new cultural point of view. Hartmann has been inspired by the ideas of authors like Daniel Quinn (Ishmael) and recognizes, as I do, that our culture, our entire civilization, is not the only way that humans have lived, and that our spiritual stories are only one fairly narrow point of view. This book is a bit rough in spots, and preachy at times, but in all it is an excellent effort to look at spirituality in a new way, one I find very interesting.This book has real content and is a great one for discussion with others--book group,etc."
5,Another Great Book From Thom Hartmann,"Once again Thom Hartmann's writing has found its way into my life. This book came along just when I needed some guidance and direction. This time he did it in the form of a novel. I had thought Thom was a powerful writing of non-fiction, but he has proved that he is an excellent storyteller as well. Be prepared that once you start reading it, you will not want to stop!Also recommended: The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight and The Prophet's Way"
3,Spiritual Secrets,"A fast, easy read. I started it with disappointment as I enjoy Hartmann's speaking style and I thought the book was too simplistic. But in the end, it provided what I was after, a easily digestible read with a little bit of story and a little bit of wisdom."
5,Another winner,"A deviation from his must-read, non-fiction titles `The Prophet's Way' and `Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight', Thom Hartmann's first fictional work is quite simply another great success. The tale of an out of work New York journalist and the mystical spiritual journey he finds himself engaged in when he risks his life to save that of a little girl, both entertains and enlightens. The Greatest Spiritual Secret is simple yet beautiful and once again the wisdom and spiritual truths shine from the pages. Another must-read from Mr Hartmann."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"Upon buying this book I had no idea what to expect. It was definitely a pleasant surprise when it arrived. It not only gave me ideas for how to mix up a dish from varying degrees of complexity, but it also made you think of other ingredients you could do the same thing with. A great resource for ideas on changing your everyday dishes into new creations."
3,Simple to Spectacular,Great bookThe recipe's are extremely well written for a cookbook and the technical abilities of the chef are well represented.if you are looking for a picture book though this is not for you as there are none.this book leaves it all to you to decide how it is presented.
4,Interesting.,"This is a great educational book. And, sometimes. a great cookbook. I have tried a number of the recipes and some are dissapointing for my family. Where this book shines is as a building block. The book shows how recipes are built, layer on layer. For a budding chef or professional, a great read."
3,No visible results,"I purchased these hoping for sofening of facial wrinkles. Two+ months into taking them and no visible change in the wrinkles. I love the ingredients, so overall, I dont regret buying them. I still have 2 months to go ( very large bottle of 240) so I am unsure if I will repurchase."
2,Didn't tighten skin,This did not tighten my skin. It did make it really silky at first then once the season changed winter it no longer worked.
3,"DMAE, Lipoic Acid and C Ester","Nice to have DMAE, Lipoic Acid and C Ester in one tablet although the directions call for four tablets a day with meals. I bought it via Subscribe and Save so it worked out to $0.09 a tablet...cheap enough ($21.64 a bottle)."
2,Snake oil,"This didn't do much for my skin. Most supplements have spurious claims in my experience, but I've had other supplements do more for me. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,good product just looking for something better,good product just looking for something better. too much suggested capsules. i notice a slight difference in my skin and I am satisfied at least with the results
1,Highly Disappointing,"This book was a major disappointment. It is a highly simplistic, broadbrush (to the point of being sloppy and slapdash) overview of Bridges' career in politics. It is shocking that a book about such a powerful congressional power broker could be so tedious, uninformative and, well, naive about the political process. It seems to be deliberately written for an elementary or high school reading level. How did Bridges become so powerful within the Senate? How did he rise to the top of the Republican congressional leadership? You won't find the answers to these questions in this book. If you are looking for a good book about politics, I would recommend any of Caro's books about Robert Moses or LBJ. The added ironic benefit is that, in a select few passages, Caro's third book about Johnson DOES contain some useful info about Styles Bridges. In a few sentences, Caro manages to tell us more about Bridges than this book does in over three hundred pages. A tragically wasted opportunity."
3,O.K. if he wouldn't have kept (...)on and on.........,"O.K. by now the world of wonderful fantisey is starting to crumble. People are starting to rate O.K. books as if they were great! I mean really! I wasen't that good! It was a complete copy of Tolken's the lord of the rings, have some sense people! If you want real fantisey, read the lord of the rings, if you already have read it again. It was to long also, like over 700 pages!! And for what? so he can kill some evil master at the end and be done with it? It was like only a two page fight and they didn't even fight, he just touched the sword and poof! He's Dead! Books over, gee."
5,the most thrilling book i have ever read,"THE SWORD OF SHANNARA IS PROBABLY THE MOST THRILLING BOOK EVER PUBLISHED IN THE FANTASY FICTION LINE. THIS BOOK HAS EVERYTHING TO KEEP YOU GLUED PAGE AFTER PAGE, THE FRIENDSHIPS, THE GOOD VERSUS EVIL, MORALITY, EVERYTHING. IT EVEN SENDS A FEW POLITICAL MESSAGES. IF YOU ONLY READ ONE BOOK IN THE FANTASY FICTION LINE. I PROMISE YOU WILL COME AWAY A FAN FOR LIFE AFTER READING THIS ONE. WHEN I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING NEW TO READ I GO BACK TO SHANNARA."
5,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book. Thought it had suspense, action and intrigue. The comparisons to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are quite trite. Brooks brings a darker, somewhat more macabre style to fantasy. The trilogy, despite the review of another member, are totally connected and their is a thread of continuity through all. A very good read, stands alone and worth your time."
4,the sword of shannara,"This book was interestingly close to the story of the lord of the rings, the plot was the same and two little insignificant men set out to save the earth from destruction from a mad being. As I read through this book I was board or confused at times even in fighting scenes some of the talk was too descriptive or not relivent this book however was a great book that dosn't leave your brain unentertained."
2,Sword of Shannara a 2 dimensional Ring Trilogy,"I must say that I have been spoiled by Tolkien and Rowling. I just finished Sword of Shannara and found it VERY long winded. The style of writing is like James Fennimore Cooper (very wordy) with characters that are so two dimensional, that they border on one dimension. I had no idea why Shea would suddenly develop a spine, why Menion Leah was even likeable or that Balinor was any more than a blonde Ken doll with a sword. I am going to read book 2 to see if Terry Brooks has grown as an author. I hope so"
5,My favorite book!,"I picked this book up when I saw it sitting on a bookshelf at my friend's house. She let me borrow it since we always trade books. I really was just looking for something to read. I never imagined that i would fall in love with this book. It's a tale that combines everything in a story, it's wonderful!I have only one mini complaint- at the end I was left with a sudden feeling of emptiness. It seemed very abrupt. I almost felt like the story simply ended with, ""and they all went home"". It left me wanting more of an explanation. That is my only complaint, happy reading!!!"
5,The real story of Brooks's first writing,"Having read the Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's writings previously, I must say that I am a fan of the fantasy genre. After reading the controversy on Amazon's reviews about Sword of Shannara, I decided that Brooks must be worth it because otherwise everyone wouldn't complain about it. I must say, I almost began to believe that it was a direct copy of LoTC in the first few chapters, but the book has a life of its own and is very different towards the end. It also comtains something not found in LoTC: humor. Not a lot of it, but it contains enough to that you may laugh at the predicament the charatcers impose on themselves. The Sword of Shannara is Brooks's first writing and it bears resemblance to LoTC probably because this was his first try. Recommended read ALL the way through, not just the first few chapters, guys. Give Brooks a chance."
2,"Very sad, derivative","Almost plot for plot, character for character, race for race a copy of lord of the rings.Brooks does get more creative with the second book, and was punished with poor sales. More derivative, poorly written sequels follow"
3,Good but a major Tolkien ripoff.,"After hearing much praise of the Shannara series at my school, I picked up this book with high expectations. Unfrotunately, I was let down, not because of the way the book was written but the story itself. If you have read LOTR you have pretty much have read this book. You have Frodo(Shea), Sam(Flick), Borimir(Balinor), and Gandalf(Allonon). Then you have a problem common in most Shannara books, the Ohmsfords. Flat, boring, goody goodies, and have as much depth as a shoe, I found almost no difference between them all. Wren(in Elf Queen) is more interesting than Wil, Shea, Flick, Coll, etc.. However, what saves this book is Brooks' highly entertaining style of writing. The seige of Tysris, the fight against the Warlock Lord, and the trials the characters have are all great to read. So read this book so you can understand the next books which have far more originality than this one. Somewhat recommended."
1,i have never actively hated a book this much!,"I've been reading fantasy for nigh on a decade now, and never never never have i read a book this horrible! i'm not just talking bad - i actively disliked this book.I'm serious. Lack of originality is only my first complaint: it is the LoTR story as rewritten by Brooks - but without any true character development, setting, etc. His writing style is bland and un-evocative. even with LoTR as his story basis, Brooks still manages to make the plot line scramble and twist in so many unfeasible ways, that the final mess is unintelligable.if you're a masochist and enjoy torturing your imagination, then please do read this book, it will be perfect for you."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I found this book to be a painful read. The characters emotions jumped all over the place. In one paragraph after Flick and Shea expend all their energies escaping the mist monster, the dreaded Black oak forest, and then lost their guide and friend after which they fall exhausted to the ground. When they awake they smile and joke with each other congratulating themselves for their success and in the same paragraph Flick see's the obvious bitter disappointment in Shea. What???? All this happens and they are making smalltalk and kidding with each other like they were going out to see a movie??? I could never tell where the characters were at emotionally. After that I sludged through a couple more chapters but finally gave up. Maybe the recommendation to stick with Tolkien has some merit?When I shared my criticism with another avid fantasy reader he assured me that Brooks has improved as a writer and so in all fairness I am going to pick up a more recent writing effort."
4,A good escape,"Oh, stop whining about the whole Tolkein thing. I read both this and the Lord of the Rings series when I was 12, and I enjoyed this one book better than the LoTR series!"
5,"I like this book. I am NOT an ""inexperienced reader"".","First of all, let me say that I am NOT an inexperienced reader. I have read David Eddings. I have read Robert Jordan. I have read Tolkien. I am NOT an inexperienced reader. All of the authors listed perviously are excellent. They are incredibly gifted authors, and I am not taking any of their credit away. Yes, I've read my share of fantasy, I'm 13, and I read this entire series while I was 9. Whup-de-do. Just read this book, it really is good."
5,One wonderful book,I don't know what you people are talking about. I've read all of Brooks works and never once related it to Tolkiens. These set of books are the best I've ever read (including Lord of the Rings). The Sword of Shannara is the best written book there is. This book grabs you from the beguinning and won't let go. I have read all of his books and I loved every one of them.
4,"An introduction to Terry Brooks' works, and a good read.","Terry Brooks' first book, The Sword of Shannara, is an enjoayable piece of fantasy fiction. Tolkien fans will immediately recognize the similarity between plot and characterization between this and The Lord of the Rings, but that does not make The Sword a bad book, or Terry Brooks a bad writer. Just because someone else invented chocolate cake doesn't mean Mom's isn't good. (I would like to add at this point--for those who name this book and others of Brooks' works cheap copies of Robert Jordan--that Brooks precedes Jordan, who in my opinion is a the epitome of weakly storied pop-fantasy). Returning to the subject at hand, The Sword is an enjoyable introduction to Brooks' Shannara books, which for the most part get better and better with each successive volume. I recommend this book to all fantasy readers. It is an easy read and the similarity to Tolkien simply expresses good taste on Brooks' part."
1,Hello... Mr. Brooks?,"Hello... Mr. Brooks? John Tolkien here. Look, I'm really rather tired of spinning in my grave and would greatly appreciate it if you would donate the profits from this little stunt of yours to charity, preferably a literacy programme of some sort. Perhaps then I might be able to rest comfortably in spite the abuse you have so richly heaped upon my life's work. Thanks ever so much."
2,Tolkien Rip off,"The plot is pretty much exactly the same as lord of the rings, he just changed some names. Ridiculous... If you want a good book stick to the original, Lord of the Rings, don't read this. No originality..and no where near as much preparation or fore-thought went into the execution of this book."
3,"Hard going in places, but necessary reading for the books to follow.","This was one of Brook's early novels and it shows. The writing struggles to engage the reader - you really find it hard to empathise with the main two characters. As others have noted, it really is similar to the Lord of the Rings, plot-wise.If you've read other Brook's Shannara stories you'll notice right away how much harder a read this is. If you are new to his universe and this is your first time reading any of his books then I'll suggest you stick with it. It IS hard going, but the background is necessary, especially for the two books that immediately follow on from it, which are much better written.Hard work, but a necessary evil to enjoy the whole of his works without a feeling of missing out."
2,Fantasy at its most...,"average.Brooks gets a C for style, a C for plot, a C for storytelling ability, an A for effort, and an A for lacking in originality.No, it's not plagiarism, just as something that has feathers, that waddles, and quacks isn't a duck.Mind you, originality in this genre is hard to come by. (I can't really grant it the grandiloquent ""oeuvre"" title. Principally because I'm not sure how to spell it, and my Chambers dictionary isn't within reach.)Brokks has written a couple of decent books: I enjoyed Running With Demons (? - I may have the title slightly wrong)but if you like good fantasy, leave this one alone. It will enrage you."
3,The 'Original' Tolkien Ripoff,"Don't knock it - he proved with this book that there was a market for heroic fantasy, even if it was a cut or three below Tolkien. Honestly, it's just LOTR warmed over and served with catsup, but at least he got off his tail and wrote it. Every time you read some big-mama doorstopper of a fantasy book, you owe this guy a big shout-out for creating the 'fantasy' department. And it's not bad, just not original. He got better, if not more original, as he went along, and there's a lot of good stuff here. But as a Wizard myself, I rate his Warlock Lord as a 4th-degree Wimpoid, and I use Skull Bearers as my pool boys because they're too dumb to make good emissaries."
5,"A classic, downside.......a copy of ideas....","the letter from allanon was just a tad like the letter from gandalf, and alanon showing up and just telling shea to leave his life in shady V. I truly do think it is one of the best books i ever have read,, but it could have had a little more originalty.. the prelude THE FIRST KING OF SHANNARA is a must read. it wass original. and i think that the HERItage OF SHANNARA was a hit too. i f i were you i would read it. ~a j"
4,An excelent read,The start is slow moving but after the adventure starts it's hard to put the book down! It is most definitly just as goodif not better) than any book Tolkin has written.
1,Could it take longer to get interesting?,"I read this book, finally. I tried starting it 3 separate times. I finally got past page 200 and my god, something happened. It slowed down again, but something happened briefly anyway. If you have a lot of patience for verbose descriptions enjoy."
1,"Actually, NO STARS!","I read this book the year it came out. It is such an awful, talent-free rip-off of Tolkien...but I won't repeat what so many others have said. All =I= can say is...GACK!!!!"
2,500 pages too long,"Yes, Terry Brooks tends to write been-there-done-that fantasy novels that are completely devoid of original ideas...that's fine. Sure, despite the pleas of the Brooks worshippers, The Sword of Shannara really *is* a transparent copy of The Lord of the Rings - don't try and deny it kids, it's far too obvious for any rational and intelligent person to ignore. Still, the Shannara books, especially the first one, could be entertaining...but they are not. Why? They are far, far too long, and not nearly interesting enough to remain readable over the span of 700 pages+. If these books were nice little 200 page works of, they would be far more tolerable than the encyclopedia sized works of copy-cat garbage that they are."
3,"Enjoyable, but familiar","I saw this book on the shelves of a bookstore about 15 years ago and thought I might enjoy reading it one day. Well, I finally read it and I'm glad I did. However, there is nothing super-original about this book. The writing style is excellent, with vivid descriptions, and the story is interesting, but I kept thinking while I read it that it was too similar to The Lord of the Rings - as everyone else seems to think also. I guess if I had never read Tolkien's books before I would have enjoyed it more. But the story is so similar that it is difficult not to draw comparisons. I would like to say that I was very sad when I finished reading the Lord of the Rings because I enjoyed them so much that I did not want the story to end. However, I think that this book and the others in the series (hopefully) will be a nice alternative to people who enjoy reading stories set in fantasy worlds."
5,I love them all!,"Terry Brooks is the best epic fantasy writer that I have ever read or heard about. With all respect to J.R.R. Tolkien, these books are a lot faster paced and more riveting. Terry Brooks, if you are reading this, write more Landovers but more importantly, more Shannarras!!! I just finished reading all of the books from both series and I love them. To all you Brooksaholics, I understand your love of these fantastic series!!!!!!!!!"
5,Loved it! Great story!,"I enjoyed this book, the charaters were interesting. It was a great and exciting story and never boring! I recomend you read it!"
2,Need to even out a table? Have insects that need killing?,"I am, I suppose, a masochist. What other reason would I have to finish this lengthy piece of insomniacs gold? The characters were certainly not memorable. I could have cared less whether the characters lived or died.There was little motivation and internal dialogue between the characters. They all moved predictably. I think the only character I cared at all about was Rock Troll.Certainly subtlety is not one of Brook's strongpoints. This book plods. It does not flow.Please, I know good fantasy can be hard to come by but try Donaldson, or George R. R. Martin. Or in a slightly off subject arena, Robert Anton Wilson, but please for the sake of your mind, skip this book, unless you have a sofa without a 3 -inch leg. Then, by all means, it is a perfect fit."
4,Wonderful epic,"Don't let the bad reviews fool you. These are people who obviously don't know their fantasy. Brooks published SoS in 1977, the same year as Tolkien's posthumous Silmarillion. Tolkien's Return of the King, which completed the LOTR cycle, was published just 20 years before. Brooks has been accused of ripping off LOTR, and there is merit in this. But so what? He admits it. Brooks is still a very good descriptive writer in his own right. And what he did with SoS was basically revive the epic fantasy, satisfying those who had been hungry for it since LOTR. So when you go into the bookstore and peruse the fantasy aisle, filled with hundred of titles, remember that Brooks started it all."
5,Sword of Shannara,Excellent page-turner that keeps you on your toes with it's unexpected twists and turns! I definately recommend this for fantasy fans!
4,Good; Not a Must,Where the HELL are all the Horses. The Characters seem to walk from one side of the world to the other in under a month. A predicable plot does not destroy the fine characterization. It also seems to hold the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in this one book.
5,What can I say? I enjoyed this book.,"It's a great story, and it kept me entertained the whole seven hundred-something pages. I don't understand why some of the other ""critics"" said it was extremely boring, and even though I haven't read Tolkien a lot (just The Silmarillion), or any of the other writers they mention, I'd like to see them try to make a book like Sword of Shannara."
3,"a good sword, but badly invented","this is really standard stuff. very uninventive. but also well written. i think the uninventiveness is the only real flaw. otherwise B carries out well. you want originality, read someone else. if you simply want a good read, here's a book for you."
1,This book is the literary equivilant to everything that is wrong in this world,Just read the title. I had to read it for school. I hate you Terry Brooks. You are the stupidity of the world
2,Couldn't Finish,"I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. It was such a poor ripoff of LOTR. I've heard his later works are better, but I'm loath to try them because of this one."
2,"Solid, but forgettable","A solid, self-contained Lord of The Rings knock-off. While Sword of Shannara doesn't break any new ground, it does have a nice simple style and may be a good choice if you like fantasy but have never read (or been able to finish) Lord of the Rings."
4,Lighten Up.,"I have news for all the fanboys out there-- Tolkien didn't INVENT elves, dragons, and magical swords... he was a scholar who took old legends and fables and put them together into a great & bestselling series (Read BEOWULF and then tell me Tolkien ""invented"" Smaug).Be that as it may, yes, SWORD follows many of the same plot-points as LOTR, but still stands on its own as an interesting fantasy series. It's been a while since I read this book, so maybe my rose colored glasses are in effect, but I remember being very into the series at the time (especially ELFSTONES, book #2). If you like fantasy, give this book a try."
1,disgusting,"""I just want this ripoff book's star rating to go down so that it accurately reflects how terrible this book is."" - original 'review,' Sept. 2005Even Worse on the Second Try...I wrote the above a year and a half ago, and then a friend came to me the other day gushing about how wonderful this book is and that I should try it because I like fantasy. I felt like weeping, but I thought maybe I would give it another shot. Bad idea. I got to page 10 and remembered why it was so terrible. Hackneyed prose, ludicrous dialogue, inept plot, and let's not even begin to talk about a lack of original ideas. If I could give it 0 stars, I would.If you have ever read a book by George RR Martin, Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, R. Scott Bakker, or even Robert Jordan... avoid this book and this entire series like the Plague. Your brain will start bleeding at around page 20.How is this book still rated 4/5 stars on Amazon??? It makes me a die a little inside and worry about the state of fantasy readership."
5,Captivating & Imaginative!,"I have read and reread this book as well as the rest of the series. By far my favorites of all books I have read. Terry Brooks introduced me to Epic Fantasy. Everyone I have talked to about these books share the same opinion. He is creative, imaginative, and captivating as he weaves intricate spellbounding stories. I recommend this book and the remaining 7 he has published in the Shannara series as MUST READS!"
5,An epic work epitomizing the best this genre has to offer.,"Terry Brooks tells a classic story that you can't help butread again and again. It's all there: valiant hero's,deep and well developed characters, fantastic battles,a rich history, and the timeless fight of good against evil.The plot gets deeper and deeper, and in so doing pulls youever farther into its folds. So grab a sword, join a partyof Elves and Dwarves, and go in search of the legendarySword of Shannara."
1,Don't Read this Book!!!,"If you are looking for some charming, well-written fantasy reads, this book is not for you. Frankly, it's pretty much a poorly-written version of Lord of the Rings with different character names and a sword instead of a ring. True, most fantasy is based somewhat on Tolkien, but Terry Brooks has stayed so true to the Feloowship that it's a bit hard to swallow. From a company consisting of all different (and magical) races, to the grey-bearded wizard who makes sporadic appearances, to the ill-disguised ring wraiths, this is a blatant rip off of superior books. If I were you, I'd buy a copy of Lord of the Rings and not waste my time on Terry Brooks."
2,Forgettable,"This was the first book I have ever read by Terry Brooks. I found it to be a rather boring read as his descriptions of places and things are quite long and unnecessarily involved. I liked the first quarter of the book but then it became so boring that I truly don't remember anything after about page 150. I am planing to read the 2nd book in this trilogy just to give this author another chance, but honestly, I am not expecting much."
2,bored out of my mind!,"I read lots of books and enjoy most of them, and even the ones which aren't particularly good I at least have no problem reading all the way through. This one though, it was just not at all engaging to me. The characters display emotions they have no right having given the flatness and colorlessness of the novel overall. And this explanation makes sense to me, sorry if it sounds a bit obscure..."
1,Limp as overcooked pasta,"Yes, this is pastiche Lord of the Rings. No, it is not done well. The characters are stereotypical cardboard, and the sense of wonder is lost. It's perhaps a plausible poolside book--light, quick, but for me it lacks the heroic grandeur of a true saga. It is one of only three books in my life (out of thousands) that I could not finish."
2,"A long, boring imitation...","One word describes this book, and the entire series - yawn. Really and truly, if you are looking for something original or fresh or new, skip right past this series and move onto another, because the Shannara series is little more than Tolkien-lite. You *could* trust the half-wits and morons who say things such as ""no its not a coppy of tolken like those other frawds out thear,"" but if there taste in literature is as good as their English......now if you want fantasy-lite, and are looking for nothing more than a rehash of the Same Old Thing, by all means read this, you'll enjoy it thoroughly. If you want something worthy of your time, however, move along..."
2,Okay but boring,"I really didn't like this book, but not really for plot reasons. I don't care if somebody uses an old well-known plot, as long as he does it well. That is what made this book not enjoyable for me. I did get through all of it, but it took me a month (amazing for me, since I rarely take even a week to read the longest of books). Obviously some people think this book is wonderful, but it just didn't have that magical quality."
3,Derivative but wholesome and entertaining,"Throughout this book I kept reminding myself that the main characters were men, not hobbits. Yes, this work is derivative. If you haven't yet read Tolkien's masterful and superior LORD OF THE RINGS, please read it first. That said, however, I still enjoyed this book, particularly as it warmed up. Like Tolkien, this is good, clean fun. Not only is there no sex, but one character even refuses to ambush the enemy because it is too much like murder. Most of the sorcery is associated with evil, and Truth even has an important role in defeating the bad guy. Positive character traits such as courage, loyalty, and responsibility are seen as things of value. Some younger children may find the language and plot more accessible than Tolkien; some adults may find it more superficial. But if your looking for some good wholesome fantasy, this book may be for you."
3,Re-Reading was disappointing,"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it, then bought several of the sequels and enjoyed them up to a point. I have just taken it up again this month, and am really astonished at how stilted the writing seems and the lack of depth in the construction of the world and the characters. Having said that, there is some good creativity and a lot of adventure - a constant exchange of one episode for the next in rapid fashion. It's an enjoyable book, but not as good as I remembered."
2,You've Read this Story Before... Many Times.,"If you're a fan of fantasy writing, I guarantee you have read this story before. Worse, it was written in a manner that is difficult for me to appreciate. Limited omniscient point of view books are hard to write, though the author does pull it off, I could not help but 'not' feel connected with any of the characters. This story was just too formulaic for my tastes."
1,Not what I expected,"I always wondered about the first book. I saw it for years in the book stores and finally broke down and read it. I like his love for the genre, and he wrote better later. But this is almost unreadable. The angry conversations felt very forced and the luck at times was way too much."
2,Technical and a copycat,"Having heard so many good things about the author Terry Brooks i was extemely eager and excited to read the Sword of Shannara. But then i did, and was completely dissapointed.And here is why:His introduction of most of his characters is decent, and i do point out,MOST of them.And only the intoduction is decent. All throughout the book, Brooks does not allow the reader to get to know his characters,he does not speak of them much(personalities, backrounds...information)or includes many conversations between them.Also, his story moves quickly, too quickly for the reader to keep up, and enjoy a good read.His writing style is very technical and cold,he prefers to be Terry Brooks telling the story, rather than having his characters telling and living it.As to the copycat mention, i spotted many similarities to lord of the rings, but that is something quite common in many science fiction writers i suppose.Similarities in both the plot and in the characters."
2,Low Quality Tolkien rip-off,"This book could almost be labeled as plagiarism, its plot is a complete rip-off of the Lord of the Rings. However, it completely lacks the majesty, creativity and beauty of the Rings series. That being said, if you have read and re-read Tolkien and are desperate, it can at least serve as a 'clean' filler reading."
2,Where have I read this before?,"This is what all the fuss was about?For readers not in the know, The Sword of Shannara is a fantasy tale told a hundred time before, by better authors each time. Virtually every post-Tolkien fantasy cliche is taken out and waved around, as if in an attempt to mesmerize readers who are easily influenced by trickery and slight of hand. (it worked, people love this book)At best, it's 350 pages too long...at worst, it's shameless, derivative refuse that manages to line the pockets of Mr. Brooks, and little more."
2,"A boring copy of the ""Lord of the Rings""","When i was reading this book, i can't escape the feeling that i've already read it - but that time it was many times better - it was ""Lord of Rings"". All characters, places and situations from ""Sword of Shannara"" were stolen from Tolkien. Allannon is the copy of Gandalf, Shea is the copy of Frodo, Shady Vale is the copy of Shire... This list goes on and on and on and will never see the end. Thus the book contains nothing original - and that is why it is so boring. It's the shame for Brooks."
2,A bad form of Lord of the rings Deja-Vu,"Brooks world and plot completely resurrects Tolkein's Lord of the rings, with only minor differences (The Ringswraiths are copied 1:1 as skull bearers, for example). Unfortunately, Brooks naive writing keeps me detached from the characters, and makes me indifferent, although the plot do contain some catching elements. No Tolkein suspense or excitement here, and the 700+ of pages seem too much to take. Not to mention that all of Tolkein's drawbacks are present here (Shallow characters with almost no emotion except fear, unreal characters, etc.)"
1,PLAGIARISM,"There is a world populated with men, elves, dwarfs and gnomes. There is an evil power and there is a good scorcerer and there is a sword and a hero with a quest. The hero being threatened by mysterious evil powers is urged by the sorcerer to leave his home. With a friend he goes to a gathering of all races. A fellowship is formed and they go on a quest. On the road they meet with a lot of dangerous adventures. There is traitor amongst them and eventually the fellowship falls apart. The hero goes for his lonely quest and the rest of the fellowship goes to the war.Now where have I read this before a thousand times better.I read this book years ago and it's still puzzling me how it still can survive while allready from the first few chapters it is sky high crying out: SHAMELESS PLAGIARISM IN ITS MOST NAKED FORM. The star I rate the book with is obligatory, but for my part it's a fat zero."
1,It KILLS (by means of boredom),"This is one book I didn't finish. I struggled through about half of it before giving up. I have just no idea of how anyone could have the talent to make such a long book so absolutely devoid of any hint of fun. The characters aren't vivid, there aren't many confrontations, and when there are, the precious ""elfstones"" always save the day, Shea doing next to nothing. I don't see how such a third-class book got so popular. Please, readers, do NOT waste time on this poor excuse of a use for paper and ink! For something worthwhile, try Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series or some REAL Tolkien."
4,Words flow like butter.,"Despite the similarities to LOTR, I didn't find this book distractingly unoriginal like everyone else. In fact, I thought it was a fun book. The words flowed very well, like poetry (and I HATE poetry). The only real distractions I noticed were when Brooks used the words ""plastic"" and ""robotlike"" to describe a couple of things. Are there robots and plastic in Shannara?"
4,My first book of Fantasy,This story is a classic to me beginning the one that got me hooked on reading. I still remember the characters fresh in my mind after almost 30 years. So I certainly recommend it as well as the rest.
5,A gem all on its own,"It's a nice story that through out the first half resembles Tolkien considerably, but from then on pretty much takes a life of its own. The parallels at first seem shameless but this little book becomes a gem of its own."
1,What is Vladlena Berbeko talking about???,"I too have not read Sword of Shanara. Hence I would not have the authority to make a comment about the novel. I have read the Lord of the Rings. I think it was a great trilogy, but how can I compare it to another book that I haven't read. This brings me to the my point, what is Vladlena Berbeko thinking? What kind of baseless chain of logic is he using to formulate his opinion? Brainless..."
2,"Unoriginal, slow and juvenile","These are the first words that come to mind in trying to describe this book. The pace is incredibly slow, beginning with a single plot line that never quite gets off the ground. There are no fresh ideas here (including several moments of unabashed borrowing from Tolkien), the characters are unexciting and the book never reaches an adult level. I liked ""First King"" enough to try this book and I was very disappointed. Proceed cautiously if you read this, being warned that you are in for a rather mediocre experience."
3,"Pretty entertaining, but predictable","This is Brooks first novel. It can be fun to read at times, but it's such a Tolkien rip off that it hurts. It's not without it's own merits however."
2,Reminds me of another book...,"Well, Terry should be thankful that Tolkien published that famous trilogy. Ironically, I think when 'The Sword of Shannara' came out so did the animated movie of 'Lord of the Rings'. Basically, many people wished Tolkien had made his book a lot bigger and I think Terry capitalized on that.I was just hoping that this book would be unique and not a copy.Flick and Shea - Frodo and Sam...Skull Creature - Ringwraiths...That's just the tip of the iceburg[...]. It seemed like it was written by some 20 year old who read 'Lord of the Rings' a dozen times. However, I did like his character Creed who was a thief. That made me read on.Anyways, I hope the rest of his books are better.[...]. The book could have been 500 pages instead of 700 plus."
1,Crow!!! Amuterish outing with no originality!,"Sword Of Shannara (SOS) was a dissapointment. At times I found Brooks' writing to be very strained and amuterish. Comparing it to LOTR? Hell no! LOTR is much better written, and it is original. Plus there is the detail involved in LOTR. SOS has little depth in this area. I have not read his other books, so I wouldn't know about them. If you want a good fantasy read, go read Lord Of The Rings, Wheel Of Time, Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever, Adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and Sword of Truth (by Goodkind). Stay away from Shannara, you will only waste your time with it...."
1,blatant rip-off of Lord of the Rings (duh),"Like one of the other reviewers, I had read Brooks' works before reading LOTR and thought they were like a Grisham novel--a fast, mindless read to waste some time. Even before reading LOTR, I noticed that Brooks tends to rehash the same plot in his Shannara books. Over and over, it was that same stupid Druid Fire that miracuously saves the happy elves and dwarves. It seemed that there was always that climactic battle at the end, where we already knew who was going to win. Oh, and always a dumb quest to retrieve something in the meantime. Brooks is the Puff Daddy of the fantasy world. He makes his living ripping off other people's works. When Brooks dies, I hope Tolkien beats him over the head as he enters the gates of heaven."
1,I went looking for a new fantasy series - and I didn't find it,"If I have to sum up this book in one word, I would say: dreadful. I finished the book, but it was a struggle. It was not just that this book was a rehash of Lord of the Rings - it was a bad rehash. The writing was absolutely horrible. There may have been a decent 250 page novel somewhere in the book, but unfortunately it would be hard to find it in the 700 pages the author delivered. The characters are uninteresting (even the ones the author explicitly tells us are interesting), the plot ""twists"" can be seen from two hundred pages away, and the conclusion is just plain boring.Given how many books there are in the Shannara series, I can only assume the author's writing improved. I have no intention of finding out for myself."
2,maybe okay for a ten yr old boy,"This book is maybe ok for a ten year old boy. I'm not saying read it if you're ten--I mean it seems like something a little boy would write. There is not one single female character in it, for one thing, which may give you some idea of its brash ignorance and immaturity. Otherwise, all else I can say is that every bit of plot or story in this book has been shamelessly plundered from other popular sci-fi/fantasy, especially LOTR (and even planet of the apes!!!). If you don't care, and just want some standard junk-food fantasy, then go for it. It seems to provide some suspense once in a while, if you skim through the filler."
1,what the hell,I love fantasy novels. LOVE THEM. This book was terrible. I wasn't sucked in at all--it is a copy of Tolkein. I am saddened that this is even compared to other great fantasy books
1,"Utter lack of craft, complete Tolkien rip-off","Brooks improves with some of his later books, but the Shannara series as a whole is still an embarrassment to fantasy. Poorly-written, an utter rip-off of Tolkien (to jump on that bandwagon) on absolutely every level (literally: from plot to characters to Brooks' attempts at world-building, the key word here being ATTEMPTS).Do yourself a favor and read some ""real"" fantasy. Personally, I would recommend Terry Goodkind, Jacqueline Carey, Brandon Sanderson, George R. R. Martin and Elizabeth Haydon."
2,What in this book isn't a Tolkein ripoff?,"I read this book and its sequels years ago and am still astounded at the level of copying Brooks did to sell books. While well written, it's ENTIRELY unoriginal...much like McKiernan's Iron Tower Trilogy (an even worse ripoff)."
3,An Enjoyable Ripoff,"Poorly written and a ripoff of The Lord of the Rings. But I enjoyed it anyway. I read this book way back in 1977 or 78 when it was first published and the parallel plot and characters struck me immediately. But they didnt' detract from the story. Just the opposite, I enjoyed noting the parallels. Is it poorly written? Yes it is. If you dwell on it, you'll you find it excruciatingly bland. But I didnt' let that distract either. The story is engaging and it held my interest. A very inferior version of The Lord of the Rings can still make a pretty good story."
3,"Good, but not that good.","This is an entertaining read, but as stated earlier, it is not very oiginal. I nearly mirrors the Lord of the Rings, but with minor surface changes. I also found the writing to be contrived, often to complex for easy reading. Brooks often strung two or three complex phrases together, creating unnecessary complexity and including too much detail. Otherwise it was a fantastic read."
1,Tolkien's evil twin,Don't read this. You'll find the same story within the text of LotR.That's all I need say.
1,I laugh when I think of this book,"I decided to read this book back when I believed most books are published because they are good. I started reading and I began noticing that the story was a copy of Lord of the Rings. I was actually quite amused by it. The similarities are so blatantly obvious that it was funny. I stopped reading half way through and don't plan to finish.This book taught me an important lesson: Just because a book is ""popular"" doesn't mean it isn't garbage. If you are into fantasy or sci-fi literature it is usually wise to take the time to read multiple and varied reviews."
1,Trash by any other name,"Helpful pop culture analogies to help you decide whether Sword of Shannara is worth your hard-earned money:The Beatles is to the Monkees asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraPearl Jam is to The Calling asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraU2 is to Coldplay asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraGuiness is to Natty Light asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraSteak is to ground dog meat asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraGrand Theft Auto is to 187 Ride or Die asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraSonic the Hedgehog is to Crash Bandicoot asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraFinal Fantasy is to Legend of Dragoon asLord of the Rings is to Sword of ShannaraBasically: a pale, unfulfilling and ultimately insulting imitation - the fact that Brooks was lazy and evil enough to copy key characters and plot points from Tolkien verbatim is just icing on a cruddy cruddy cake.Don't buy this book."
2,Fails to get the ball rolling,"I made the mistake of reading Brokks's second novel before this one. Elfstones was incredibly paced and wrought with excitement. Sword, which is refrenced several times in Elfstones, really begins at a plodding pace. The book is slow beyond words and shows no signs of picking up the pace. I was seriously disappointed after I started reading it. In fact I actually put the novel down for a year before going back and trying to get through it. Once you get beyond the half way point things do pick up, they do become exciting, and it all becomes worthwhile. It just takes a little too long to do so. At 700 + pages I really want a tale, what you get is a primer for the tales to come. In truth, that is probably what made the Elfstones so fun, the world was fleshed out and Brooks had a plan. Read this more as an afterthought, get Elfstones first and then move into the rest of the series. You will get more out of the Sword in that manner."
3,"Well written, but far from imaginative or orignal","I like the way Terry Brooks writes, however, the story line is a little too similar to The Lord of the Rings. Actually, it's almost identical. To his credit, Brooks writes very well, but this book isn't that creative. Skullbearers? Come on. Not a bad read if you haven't read Tolkien, but then again, if you haven't read Tolkien, don't bother yet with any other fantasy writer."
3,A VERY good book!! Except for one thing...,"If you ever read "" The Lord of the Rings "", then read this book, you'll notice something. Did you ever think of Gollum when you read about Orl Fane? Here are some other similarities: Allanon- Gandalf, Shea-Frodo, Black Oak's-Mirkwood, Culhaven-Rivendell, Warlock Lord-Sauron, Skull Bearer's-Ringwraiths, Balinor-Aragorn. And there are sooo many others! Other than that, though, it was a great read!"
2,To be a kid again...,"Well, as Rich (dzrtnight@usa.net) points out:""I read both this and the Lord of the Rings series when I was 12, and I enjoyed this one book better than the LoTR series!""This is 100% true, and a good indication of how this book is. If you are 12, you will probably like this book. If you are not, well, it's a toss-up. You'll enjoy this if you haven't read much decent fantasy - if you thought the Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance books were good, you'll love this. If, however, you've read quite a bit of good fantasy, you'll likely find that this is more of the same, and not done very well at that.Unless, of course, you are 12."
1,buy my copies.....please,"Ugh. I have to assume that these folks who find merit in the Shannara series are children, or at the very least do not do much reading, because this is one of the most contrived, boring works I have ever had the displeasure of trudging through. Make your judgement by the blithering idiots who defend this book, and buy another. A direct copy of Tolkien? An understatement, and anybody who tries to tell you otherwise simply does not know what they are talking about. It's paint-by-numbers Tolkien, and a bad job was done at that.Now, I'm told that Brooks has gotten better, and that the Shannara series is actually enjoyable now. Good for Brooks. I'll not be torturing myself again with this drivel. Sure, if you are a kid and don't know any better, pick this up and enjoy. If, however, you are an actual *reader* looking to read something with value, well, skip this."
1,Spare me,"Those of you who compare Brooks to Tolkien are totally wrong. There is no comparism between them. Tolkien is great, and Brook's books are have no real plot, no character development, and are downright boring. You're insulting Tolkien by comparing Brooks to this guy. If you want to read a book you can really call fantasy read Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, or David Eddings. Then come back and compare Brooks to Tolkien. People who do so have no reading experiance, and should not be writing reviews about it."
2,Average Fantasy,"Being an avid reader of fantasy novels I was disappointed after reading The Sword of Shannara. I found the story to be yet another spin on the quest motif. While quest stories are an intrinsic part of fantasy literature, I feel that the author must create interesting and believable characters in order to compensate for a common storyline. Sadly I did not feel this book demonstrated such a quality. The characters all seemed to have very little personality (apart from them all being disconsolate, a word Mr. Brooks must be overly fond of). Having read other novels by this author I must say I feel this was an exception rather than the rule. I've enjoyed many stories Mr. Brooks has written. I do not think I'll continue reading this series, however."
3,Didn't I hear all this before?,"Ok here's the thing ,this book is a copycat and a exact repleca of Tolkein's masterpiece.The characters in this book lack depth and originality .The places are also similer and the storyline is exactly the same.I gave the book a 6 which is more then it deserves. Shame on Terry for making a mockery of one of the best books of all time J.R.R Tolkien's The lord of the rings."
2,Copycats sometimes prosper,"I first read this book many years ago, when it was first published. Let me say that no one has any business reviewing this book unless they have first read The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, which was written before the Sword of Shannara. The plots are virtually identical. Since then, Mr. Brooks has written many original stories which are excellent and which are not copies of anyone else as far as I know. Even the Sword of Shannara is a good story, but it is quite clearly to me, mostly a copy of Tolkien with a few cosmetic changes, i.e., different character names and different talisman characteristics. Shame on Terry for doing this, but at least it led to the Elfstones of Shannara, which is a superb and original work."
2,Poor Tolkien imitation,I'm extremely disapointed. This book seems a copy of Tolkien's Lord of the rings. The basic idea's the storyline and the characters seems almost open imitations of Tolkien's masterpiece...shame.
4,Starts out slow but finishes with a bang!,"Terry Brooks took to long in trying to develop the characters and than when it came down to it they weren't completely developed. But all in all the last four hundred or so pages picked up speed and made up for everything lost in the beginning. The friendship between Shea, Flick, Hendel, Balinor and the Elven Brothers, as well as Allanon was shining true by the time the end of the book came. The mastery of the war scenes were pretty detailed in describing the events. His writing style is a little weird to get used to but it is worth it. My advice: stick through the first three hundred or so pages and you will be in for a treat."
2,"Not to be redundant, but it is","I normally don't review something that is reviewed a bunch of times where I have nothing really new to say, but I'll say it anyway. Total rip off of the Lord of the Rings. A writer trying to find his voice, but failing. Hints that it could have been really good, but it's not. Characters escaping everywhere by sheer dumb luck, rather than their brains and courage. Didn't finish it. Not planning on going back."
1,Outrageous - Just an imitation,"I can't understand how this book became a best-seller. This book is just an imitation of the lord of the rings, and Brooks is just an imitator of Tolkien. This book can not help the fans of heroic fiction litterature, and does not have a well-structured story. It's too simple; it would be good for children 10 years old."
5,Wonderfully,"My friend had read the whole series, so after I finished Potter and the Hobbit, I was thirtsting for more fantasy. My friend looked at me smiling and gave me an old copy of this book, I sat down and read the first page, and I suddenly knew why he was smiling; this was going to be a lot of fun to read. I read the amazing story of Allanon, Shea, Flick and their friends. Though it may be a bit of a ""formula"" book, it has verve, and flair. Unlike some other books, it wasn't a recognizable formula, where I am predicting what will happen on the next page...it takes unexpected turns and dips to make you feel as if you have just climbed off Space Mountain after you stop reading. A wonderful reading expierience, an amazing book filled with excitment and wonder. A good present for Fantasy loving, friends or family members."
1,Not at all like the book,"Hey guys seriously here, I love the books and Terry Brooks- all his books. but this AudioTape skipped alot of the important action and character developement. On a long trip I decided to get this for my girlfriend and I to listen to and let me tell you - she has never read the series and found the audio confusing and felt no connection to any of the characters, Even I was lost and confused. Until they come with an UNABRIDGED version- Do Not Buy this!"
1,Awful,"I had to force myself to finish this book. It was so unoriginal and boring, I almost just gave up completely."
2,Too much hype on this book...,"I haven't read any of Tolkien's books before so my reason for the low rating has nothing to do with it being a rip-off or whatever. I thought that this book was just pretty bad. The plot seemed lame and very generic. The characters were annoying. Shea is hardly a hero, even if he's portrayed as a reluctant one. Allanon is droll and Flick is just plain annoying. Half this book is filled with drawn-out descriptions of backgrounds. While some books make such descriptions readable (The Dragonlance Trilogy is good at this), I ended up skipping a lot of paragraphs and pages in this book. This is just one of those books where I was forced to finish it."
2,tolkien rippoff,"Come on, Allanon. Please this is Gandalf. The only differce in that this guy is the most boring and stupid Gandalf copy i have ever seen. The hero has to go on a quest to destroy the Skull dude. To do this he has to find a sword that will enable him to do this. He has only a few companions. Everything stinks. The characters arent developed, the plot is boring and the bad guy is barely mentioned. This is the worst Tolkien ripoff i have ever seen."
3,Read the First King of Shannara first.,"I am one of the rare few fantasy readers that just can't getinto this book far enough to actually complete it. No, my mind is notsimple. I just can't get past the lack of character development. I felt that Mr. Brooks was trying too hard to avoid sounding Tolkienesque, losing a fair amount of solid writing in the process. When I tell people that it has now taken me over 10 years to get into this book (that is correct, no typo!), they often tell me to skip this one completely and read the next in the series. I have read half of it on more than one attempt, and have now come up with what I consider to be a better decision. This was his first book, and it shows. Persistent as I am, I bought a copy of First King of Shannara. If only he'd written that first. I couldn't put it down (except to write this review). Fewer than 100 pages are left in this journey. I believe my quest to conquer reading Sword of Shannara is finally within my grasp."
2,Derivitive Pap,"Like many others here, I read the Sword of Shannara at a young age, although after reading the Lord of the Rings. Even then (I must have been about 12 or so), I could see how much of a copy this was. It's as if someone gave an adolescent the Cliff's Notes to Lord of the Rings and told him to write a book based on it. I don't buy the idea that that's OK because 'no one has any original ideas after Tolkien.' Apparently these people have never read A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin, which I HIGHLY recommend."
1,paint by numbers,"I just couldn't take it. I don't demand revelatory originality in my escape reading, but this was such an obvious rip-off of LOTR, I couldn't stomach it. Every single element was a blatant substitution for something from Tolkein, and so obvious it was distracting!Instead, I foundThe Belgariad, Vol. 1 (Books 1-3): Pawn of Prophecy, Queen of Sorcery, Magician's Gambitand got my fantasy fun. Sure, it's archetypal to the point of cliche, but with its own internal logic and some satisfying psychological insights, so I was able to enjoy it on its own terms, not as a thinly veiled copy of something better."
3,The First in a Series,"The book is pretty good, the only thing was that it sounded so much like the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, right down to seven original members in the group. They've got elves, dwarves, a mysterious mage, and two scared but determined young men on which the fate of the races rests upon. They eventually end up separated, some of them go to face the approaching war while the other goes to deliver the ring, or recover the sword in this case, while the mage comes and goes as he wishes, revealing what he wishes of the whole picture. Aside from the echoes of other books in it, it was not a bad book, i liked the second one better, though."
2,Sword of Shannara...Or Lord of the Rings,"When I first picked up this book, I thought, wow, how cool is this? The plot seemed very cool and the characters realistic. Reading it, though, I was very disappointed. The book was definitely a [copy] of Lord of the Rings, including a magical token, a wizard, elves, dwarves, and the small common man that has to do great deeds. Don't forget the shadowy evil figure! Besides the copying of the plot, the characters were not very in-depth. I would like to know more about them, but the author barely scratches the surface. Still, some parts were okay, which kept me reading the book until the end. It took forever, as I was bored by it and easily distracted. Overall, it was ok."
3,"A pleasing novel, but not for older readers","I read this book at a quite young age, and couldn't put it down. In that, it was brilliant, but anyone in their twenties really has no business reading this stuff to begin with. It's of course not the Lord of the Rings, rather an imitation, but a pretty good and entertaining one. I read a few of the sequels, and understand there are now too many to count, which is rather a shame. But this one is a thrilling read and loaded with enought imagination and adventure to set it apart from its peers."
1,A struggle,"I struggled through this book. The writing style was ponderous at best. In the end, I didn't care about the main character. I actually disliked her and I don't think that was the intention. Plus the ending was rather anti-climactic. All in all a disappointment."
5,owls aren't wise,Mr. Shedd brings wisdom & humor to his subject. It is a book that could be enjoyed by adults or read to small children. It's great to have a book that dispells so many myths.
4,Excellent Book on North American Wildlife,"You'd be hard pressed to find a book more packed with fascinating information that Warner Shedd's ""Owls Aren't Wise And Bats Aren't Blind"". Each chapter provides a concise description of the characteristics and habits of a particular animal (or family of animals), and, as the book's subtitle suggests, debunks some common myths about North American wildlife. Shedd's writing style is earnest and straightforward, and is perfectly suited for this type of book. Shedd deftly addresses controversial issues in a reasonable manner, and imparts a wealth of information about some common wildlife. A chapter on snakes would have been welcome, although I'm sure a discussion of the myths surrounding snakes would fill an entire book on it's own. This is an information packed book that has appeal for a wide age range."
5,Owls aren't,"Excellent book , after I read it I now use it as a reference when I want to check on a certain animal. I bought 2 more and gave them as gifts."
1,Do Not Buy: This item arrived with missing part,When we ordered this bike. It arrived poorly shipped. The box was beaten to a pulp. It was missing key part such as the seat post clamp. and it was the wrong seat post. Because the seat post was narrow to belong to the bike we purchased. We had to spend an additional $80 to have a bike repair shop fix the problem. The brakes were improperly adjusted and the main handle bar was bent and loose. Also the wheels were slightly bent which makes riding this bike very difficult. I would stay away from this bike.
1,Beware,"Do not buy this product. It came partially assembled in a box with several holes in it. No foam or other type protection. I should have known something because the rear derailer was sticking outside the box. The assembly directions were generic for all Huffy bikes. Pics of the handlebars, pedals, seat, etc looked nothing like this bikes. Instructions were OK for the brakes (as a kid, I adjusted these type brakes and luckily I remembered how). The directions to adjust the gears and derailers however were absolutely awful. It said certain parts were marked that were not and after about two hours of trying I gave up. The directions even said that I should take it to a bike shop for adjustment of the gears. Yeah, for $75!!! Needless to say, it was disassmebled and returned. Only good thing is Amazon's tremendous return policy. Kudo's to Amazon, but frowns to Huffy."
2,Simple,"This book is simple, not scholarly. If you are looking for a seminal work on James K. Polk, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are looking for an easy read to familiarize yourself with his life and presidency, this is kind of like the spark notes version."
2,Disappointed.,"I guess I am the only one reviewing this that thinks this unit doesnt work very well. It may be because I tried using it to replace a much more expensive unit that had broken and was used to a HUGE difference in perfomance. I ended up buying another expensive one and this Hunter is going in a garage sale. Live and learn. My Ecoquest is the only air purifier I need for about 1500 square feet of space and it is very quiet. It also features a sanitize option that kills bacteria. I guess I think by the time you buy enough of the Hunters to do a good job you could buy a GOOD unit. And you dont have purifiers sitting all over the house, something I would find annoying."
3,L stephens,This unit works very well BUT it moves so much air that its like having an osillating fan on high so you can only use it during the warmer months because it cools the room off.You can't use it in the bedroom because it makes to much noise so if all you care about is the filtering air then by all means buy it.
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Have read a lot of references to Chesterton's writings. This is the first piece I've tried to read of his, and not really too impressed. Just kind of weird."
4,Lighter Verse from a Heavy Thinker--Literally,"G. K. Chesterton is known for his essays, devotional works, detective stories, literary criticism and biographies--but he is not a well known poet. While Chesterton was often an excellent poet, as readers of works such as ""Ballad of the White Horse"" and ""Lepanto"" can attest, most of his poems have generally been forgotten. The poems included in ""Wine, Water, and Song,"" which was first published in 1915, are not the heavy fare that, say, ""Lepanto"" is. There are some charming, light hearted poems in this collection. While often funny, Chesterton's poems offer wisdom as well as a few laughs. Chesterton's fans will enjoy the book. Still, readers who are not as familiar with the author might fight the often repetitive style a bit wearying. Reader encountering Chesterton for the first time would probably do better elsewhere."
5,Excellent Game,"I have to admit the first time I played it I wasn't sure how I felt about it mainly because I had to do a good bit of tweaking on my computer to get it to work right, but I am currently replaying it and loving every second of it. The single player is most impressive with top notch graphics, and a kick [rear] and totally engrossing storyline. The lightsaber matches are the best part to me, the moves you can do make it thrilling and incredibly fun to do. The multiplayer is excellent as well. I hope there is a another game in the works as I want more of this to play.Hats off to Lucasarts and Raven software for an excellent game"
5,THE BEST GAME EVER,I have to tell you that this game is amazing. IT IS THE CLOSEST YOU WILL COME TO BEING A REAL JEDI!!!I was completely enthralled from beginning to end.WILL THERE BE ANOTHER SOON?????GOD I HOPE SO!!!!!
2,This game is pretty pour,I guess the first thing i'll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game. I was HUGELY dissaponted. I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great. I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying. There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought. There are way to many puzzles - I don't mind puzzles but there are simply way to many. And some on them are insainly hard. I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy - way better the puzzles aren't insain and you get to choose what you look like and....well I could go on but i'll leave it there. If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is $20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game. Just don't get this game.
3,save your money,Could have been the greatest game ever if it wasn't so difficult. The level of gaming skill required to successfully play this game ruins it. Save your money.
3,Jedi Knight II Outcast,"...Raven Software is the company making this great game, with old multiplayer levels, returning force powers and Kyle Katarn!! Personally I think Mysteries of the sith was not that good, but Raven won't screw up with this one, and did you notice the graphics from Dark Forces II? Now it'll have sweeter graphics using the Quake III engine. (See PCGamer mag.)I am willing to pay even $50$ for this game!! Just buy it. Reserve the copy because it'll probably be out in Electronics stores. shelves"
2,SWITCH FLICKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game should really be called SWITCH FLICKER:Jedi Outcast 2.I may only be ten,but I know video games.I`ve been playing games since I was two years old!All you really do is run around pressing identicle swithces!!Sure you get to be a Jedi,but this game SUCKS!The only reason I gave this junk a 2 is because it has OK graphics."
5,Great game,"I own the Collector's Edition of this game- and boy, am I glad that I got it. Along with the original Dark Forces and Jedi Knight, I also received a cool looking light-up lightsaber keychain.As for the game itself- overall, it's a masterpiece. The gameplay is filled with fun lightsaber, guns and force power action. Yeah, the puzzles could be a bit more varied, but they're not that hard as others have claimed. The graphics- man, one of the smoothest that I have seen. The plot will keep driving you till the end. I haven't played MP over the net, but with bots- it's not so bad... Of course- the music and sound is top notch. With guess appearances by Lando (voiced by Billy Dee Williams himself!) and Luke (yeah, you get to fight along side them), this game really is top of the line.Is it as revolutionary as Half-Life or Deus Ex? In short, no. But, it's pretty good in terms of capturing the movies and going just a little bit beyond."
5,Best game ever. No Doubt.,"For all of you who have 2 lives( One as a Jedi and the other as a nerd) and those of you who are just ""normal"" non force wielding human beings, This game is the greatest ever. This game has it all. Excellent single player campaign with the BEST storyline ever. Excellent FREE no-obligations Multiplayer through the game directly, no 3rd party software needed. Beautiful, crisp, and awesome graphics. Awesome guns and force powers, and yes the light saber combat is beautiful as well, down to the sound. Excellent replay value included. If you're a flaming huge Star Wars nerd such as myself, this game is the reason you exist. If you're a hardcore gamer looking for a new title, they don't get much better than this. I recommend this to anyone and everyone with two eyes and a brain. Well you could have one eye and enjoy it just as much I'm sure.. but.. well.. yeah.. it's great.. HAVE FUN!!"
2,A Very Hard Game,"At first I thought this game would be fun, but the first level was very hard. It took two weeks to the first level not to mention the puzzles and hidden switches in every single level. The cutscene looks terrible. There are somethings I like about this game like the lightsaber, weapons and the storyline. The multiplayer is even more terrible if you have a 56K modem. I'm a star wars fans but I have to say this game could have been better. If you have to choose from Jedi starfighter or Jedi outcast, I recommend Jedi Starfighter."
5,The Saga Continues,The original Jedi Knight (along with the Mysteries of the Sith expansion/addition) have been nothing short of spectacular and are still very popular with gamers even though they are already several years old.Jedi Outcast has enhanced graphics and gameplay which will make it that much better than the original Jedi Knight. I definitely recommend this product to any Star Wars fan or gamer.
4,A great game but.........,Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast is a great game with an espectacular design and great jugability but often one player mode misions often get too long.....But the multyplayer mode is superb it haves an large arsenal from sabers and blasters to self powered turrets and the capability of playing whit lots of players. I like these game (one of my favorites) but after a while of playing it gets a little boring (because a played this game for a long time). On my recomendation i say you should buy it.
5,the BEST game for the PC,"Dark Forces was that game with all choppy graphics and had no lightsaber. Then came Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight. The same horrible graphics as Dark Forces. Actually, not much different except new weapons. Then came Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. When my cousin bought it, I went to play it. It was the best game I've ever played on the PC. The choppy graphics had been totally upgraded so you can see clearly as if it was real life. So I went home and downloaded the demo, available from LucasArt's official site. I played it almost every day all through spring and summer and now it's December 2002 and I'm still playing it! Plus, Dark Forces and Jedi Knight had NO CHEAT CODES!! Now, Jedi Outcast has some of the best cheats in the world. I know almost every one. There's even one to change the color of your lightsaber! It's totally a must-have. Remember--avoid the two old ones."
5,OutCast,"THIS GAME IS COOL AND BY COOL I MEAN TOTTALLY SWEET!!!!!!YOU CANNOT EVEN TOUCH THIS GAME BECAUSE YOU DONT OWN IT, IT OWNS YOUIT IS THE REAL ULTIMATE POWER IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!!!!"
4,Star War fans must have this title,No library would be complete without this game.It has some of the original cast with great graphics and story line.some scenes were a little choppy but nobodys perfect.
4,Almost awesome,"I got this game almost when it first came out, but my video card was to bad to run it properly. So I eventually got a new video card a more RAM, and it works fine until I get to a big area. I am above system requirements. Pentium 2 450, 256 MB RAM, Nvida Geforce 4 video card, yet it can vary from 70 to 7 frame per second. Well it seems cool, but I stopped playing it because of the performance. I hope to play it again when I get my new computer soon. The system requirements should recommend higher than they do. But if you have a P3 or better, 256 MB RAM or more, and a 32MB video card or better, this gae should give you many hours of fun."
5,"Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 ""Rocks""","I love this game. This game really is awesome. I play it a least 4-5 times a week. If you have a gamming PC like I have, You won't regret owning this game. And if you have one of the latest video cards, Like ATI 9700 or 9800, It will look awesome."
4,Enjoyable strictly from the genera perspective,"The star rating is just specifically related to the game play. It is a very enjoyable game and who doesn't love the Star Wars ""Universe""? But overall the game falls short in the graphics category. I was expecting much more out of Lucas Arts / Raven than what was released. Blocky graphics, horrible looking cut scenes (as compared to Return to Castle Wolfenstein) and a targeting system that's tenuous at best. If I were to score based wholly on graphics, I'd have to give it 2 out of 5 stars.Good game play, Jedi powers, a Lightsaber and a decent story line make up for the pedestrian graphics.For those that are compelled to flame, I'm running a P4 1.6 GHz, 1GB RAM, with a GeForce3 AGP."
4,The PC game of the games!,"This is one of the coolest games I have had! First you play as Kyle Katarn without a lightsaber and in the ""Yavin_Trial"" level you get a lightsaber! You fight stormtroopers, imperials, turrets, sentrys, probes, crabs, Weequays, Rodians, Grans, Reborns, Tavion, shadowtroopers, Galak and the hardest to beat, Desann! The maps where you go are Kejim_post, Kejim_base, Artus_mine, Artus_detention, Artus_topside, Valley, Yavin_temple, yavin_trial, Ns_streets, Ns_hideout, Ns_Starpad, Bespin_undercity, Bespin_streets, Bespin_platform, Cairn_bay, Cairn_assembly, Cairn_reactor, Cairn_dock1, Doom_detention, Doom_shields, Yavin_swamp, Yavin_canyon, Yavin_courtyard and Yavin_final. Desann is the most powerful enemy in the game that you will never get to grip him. Well Galak in his forcefield armor is a little hard to beat like Desann, you can't grip them."
4,Load Time,"Nice Game. Good game to pass the time. More involved than the last one. One thing wrong: LOAD TIME! I have never in my life had a game that took this long to load. When I start this game, I can wash and wax my car, only to come back and wait for it to finish loading. It is not like I have an old system.1.7 GH, 256mb RDRam, Nvidia G-Force 2 GTS, & 48x cdrom.You have to have the patience of Job to wait on this one. Younger less patient people will throw something or pitch a fit."
5,Best Game-Until KotOR,"This game is awesome! I love all the awesome lightsaber moves and how the different levels of the Force Powers make the powers do different things! This compares quite favorably to Jedi Knight. For one thing, in Jedi Outcast, you actually flip when doing Force Jump, unlike Jedi Knight. This game is so realistic! If you're a fan of Star Wars, and really want to get into the Star Wars universe, this is the game for you!"
4,Good game to kill a couple of days,"The single player for this game is good. There are many parts in it where a walkthrough, or a friend who has already done it, is almost necessary. But as soon as you beat the single player, thats it. I saw no reason to touch the game again. Because the multiplayer is bad.The multiplayer is a test to find out who has figured out how to use lightning and who hasnt. As soon as you set your configuration to the dark side and set lightning as a hotkey, all you have to do to win is hold in that button."
2,Jedi Nighty night,"All I have to say bout this game is that it is fun for a couple hours once you get your lightsaber. There are some fun levels and special effects are great but.... now the con- no real replayability, once I finished it, which didn't take too long, I didn't want to play it again, and the multiplayer isn't much better than the first jedi game... I recommend waiting for Knights of the old republic to come out if you really want to lightsaber duel. Also Star Wars Galaxies is coming out in January and will be a great online RPG- with space wars and light saber battles."
3,Yes for the music and graphics,"... Have you played jedi knight 1 there isn't much deference in the game play , use lightsaber and jedi powers, enemies are the same.But the adding of puzzles and the video enhancement have made it a plus. But the puzzles sometimes puzzle you so much that you have 1) use cheat codes 2) have the walk-through.This game kinda a reminds me off Riven the sequel to myst...Good graphics but puzzles kinda hard sokmetimes...But yes it worth your money if you are a Star Wars fan.Get up there and get the game...."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would!,"LucasArts STOLE MY MONEY!this is one of the worst games i've bought in 4 years. Although the graphics may be fancy thats about it. The game play is terrible, the levels are dry, and the animations are choppy (even on my P4 256ram!!!!). Its like the only thing they focused on was pretty still pictures to lure unsuspecting gamers with screan shots. This game is JUST NOT FUN!In addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version. I believe that they released this game way to early and I would not buy this product! Save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo on!STARWARS stamped across the box cannot justify such a terrible game."
1,How Good Games Go Bad,"I have played the first jedi knight, and I thought that it was freakishly horrific. You other people don't have a clue what you are talking about, but I do. I have the PC Gamer magazine that talks about this game, and it looked pretty bad to me. Plus, I don't like the way Raven makes the game: it makes them (...), just like Elite Force. The Quake III engine is just as bad as everything else, so I am not too happy about the release of this game!"
2,Not that satisfied,"Came in a CD plastic case, thought it was a cardboard box...For the low price I don't mind the misrepresentation."
5,Danger: EXTREMLEY FUN,Wow. What a fun game it is the best I have so far now don`t get confused that this game is just shooting shooting shooting but to do the shooting shooting shooting you have to solve puzzles.For those who have a fire wall beware to do multi-player you have to do some tech mumbo jumbo.I havent played multi-player yet (what do you think I`m doing next!) but have watched the movie preiview and it lookes exxelent you do not have to played hte first one to play this one:THIS IS NOT AN EXPANSION PACK!!!!! But you can learn quickly so get gamming bye!
5,This Game Is Awesome,"The game came in the original packaging and the CD looked to be never used so I know it was new. It plays great on my Win7 computer. If you like a first person shooter, this game is awesome. I had it before, but my cd got damaged and would not play. My 4yr old is a Stars Wars nut and he loves the game - so do I."
3,Falls short,"I was expecting a lot more of Jedi Outcast before I played it. The single player is decent and challenging. However, the multiplayer was very disappointing. Graphics wise it does not disappoint. The sound is also excellent.The problem for me? The multiplayer is not very impressive. It basically comes down to a bunch of players running around either wildly waving their lightsabors jumping through the air or there's the players who sit around and as snipers and take you out while your fighting with another player. It just gets old after awhile. The reason this was a disappointment was the game was built on the same engine as Return to castle wolfenstein, and the multiplayer in that game is astounding. I truly was expecting more of the same in this title but I was very disappointed."
3,Lack-lustre.,"Making a career and some recordings in the USA, Beatrice Long features as the fourth pianist to contribute a volume in the Naxos projected series of the complete sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti. The recording was made in 1996 but not issued until 2002. It will do little to enhance the reputation of the pianist, the series, or Scarlatti himself. There is drama, magic, grandeur and ingenuity aplenty in these single movement works, but little of it is projected here. K 443, for example, so full of rhythmic energy and guitar figuration, comes across as four minutes of dullness. Duller even still is the piano tone throughout. Rarely have I heard such lack-lustre sound quality in a digital recording. Only in terms of duration is this CD good value, running for a second short of 80 minutes."
1,Did I miss something?,"Is it a Scarlatti recording, or just a faint approach of Chopin's music? Someone is using the wrong score? Maybe do some reading before recording and re-discover the facts about music periods and style?"
1,Not worth the money,"I love Dale Carnegie's books, philosophies, and excellent advice, but Arthur Pell's book is nothing more than a score card for Carnegie's workshops & programs. If you're looking for the same insight that Carnegie usually offers, don't bother with this book. I'm taking mine to the thrift shop."
1,Didn't receive my purchase...,"I had purchased a book some time ago on the date of 8/31/09. It has been a Month and I still not received my purchase. In my opinion, this is horrible business."
4,The First Songs of the First Lady,"This was the album that introduced Tammy Wynette to the music world. It was a musical form of experimentation for Wynette and her producer, Billy Sherrill, trying to find the right songs for her one of a kind voice (""the voice with the teadrop with in""). The collection contains her first single, a minor hit, ""Apt. #9"", and her second single, a major hit, the title track from the album. Wynette & Sherrill win sometimes with the likes of 'Send Me No Roses', 'The Phone Call' and a cover of Jeanne Seeley's 'Don't Touch Me' but fall a little short with 'I'm Not Mine To Give', 'I Would Easy' and a cover of Loretta Lynn's 'Dont Come Home A-Drinkin'. 'Almost Persuaded', a #1 hit for David Houston and a song Sherrill had all his acts record at one time or the other, is included. It is interesting to note that Tammy sings a cover of 'Walk Though This World With Me' ... the then-current song by her musical mentor and future partner, George Jones."
4,Good Book,Got this for a study group and it is good. There are questions posed after each section that inspire thoughts and discussion. Great for group study or individual.
4,James; a Lifestudy,"Very detailed book on the bible book of James. Very indepth and worthy of studing, especially for a small group of Christian followers."
2,not what I expected,"Answers had already been written in the blanks, which was unexpected and unacceptable. The seller, however, responded kindly and refunded my money. I would have preferred expedited shipping but it was unavailable."
3,machete,"I did not realize that this was a chinese made item, or I probably would'nt have bought it. I try to only buy American products when I buy an item that I want but can really live without, that being said, it has worked really well for trail clearing and the other few times I've used it."
3,Alright,"This film was okay. Nothing spectacular, not alot of depth or anything new really. I think it was good that the homeless men were able to travel to a different country and participate in a team sport and compete with teams from different nations. The idea of a homeless world cup is unique.The matches lack the big money and endorsements of professional soccer teams. I felt particularly sympathetic towards the Afghani since he had to live under the repressive regime of the Taliban and lost his home to war."
4,"well made, good product, but not completely in-Channell","I bought these about 5 months ago and compared to other deflectors they are much thicker and are Tinted NOT Black PLASTIC (that you can not see through)LIKE A LOT OF OTHER CHEAPER Deflectors..my only complaint is my front window deflectors are IN -Channell EXCEPT at the end of the deflector and it clips on to the pillars.. Normally this would not be a problem ,BUT(1) Weathertch does not tell you they use an S-Clip(2) The S-CLIP is made for a factory pillar , but i bought stainless steel i pillars that go over the black pillars.. and the S clip does not fit!!OVERALL , i am happy with theses visors ,Thay appear to be of Good Quality!"
3,Typos,"There is no river Kistna in the Deccan.There is however a river called the Krishna which is one of the biggest in the Deccan pleateau.Methinks that when writing about what was a labour of love of such magnitude Mr.Keay would have bothered to get the names right at least Yrs, matt"
4,A Fine Book,"Terrific and engaging read, really. I, however, must correct the reviewer from Cochin, India. Surely the 'Note on Spelling' that precedes the narrative should have clarified matters. In the note the author indicates that he has adopted nineteenth-century spelling to be consistent with the original documents."
3,Kistna or Krishna?,"Ask a local to the area and he'll tell you it's Kistna. The other reviewer failed to read the Introduction from the author where this and other spellings in the book differ and why they do.As for the book, it could have had more detail on some other interesting issues, such as living arrangements, diet, etc of the workers. Another typical history book written from the viewpoint of the victors. How about the thousands that gave their lives?Why did I give it three stars (instead of two)? Well, it is an interesting topic that you will not find elsewhere. If you liked ""Longitude"" then you'll love The Great Arc. [...]I guess it didn't make the best sellers list."
4,GOOD BUT NOT EXCELLENT!!!,"Beethoven's cello sonatas are represented well in some excellent recordings-Kempff&Fournier are splendid,so are Richter and Rostropovich.These are the top choices.This performance by Tichman and Kliegel are quite good but not in the same league.It was Arthur Schnabel who said that where he differs from most other pianists is not in playing the notes but in the interval between the Notes!This is what comes to mind in listening to the excellent Richter and Rostropovich recordings.There is a greater sense of cohesion and Drama heightened by Zippy runs and slowing downs without seeming to wait for each other!This is not the case here.Just straightforward playing.I feel however this is better than the Argerich Maisky recording,where Argerich completely dominates the proceedings leaving Maisky struggling!However if you do have the Kempff-Fournier or Richter-Rostropovich recordings(There is an excellent DVD of this pair)you need not go for this set."
2,A Great Album ruined,"Having had the orginal album from release in the 80's I was keen to get a remastered copy on CD. Gosh, how dissapointing to find the awful version of the title track. The original vinyl version is so much better. Even worse is the closing track 'My Kingdom Come'. Towards the end of the track you can hear the tape slowing down, taking it out of key and sounding totally awful. I couldn't believe my ears so I dug out my original vinyl. No speed bend on this, vocals sound ace, and with the better version of the title track it sounds better in every respect. I doubt I'll play the 2003 remaster again - I'll copy the vinyl. Very, very dissapointing - a great album ruined!!!!"
5,Start the Madness,"The Lords at their zenith. The last IRS record by the band, it moves more into heavy metal figures sonically and psuedo satanist imagery lyrically. This one is most like the new 2003 incarnation of the band fronted by StevenMarque; and you can really see Stiv's influence on him on tracks like KISS OF DEATH, DO WHAT THOU WILT and SEDUCER. Like any other LORDS album, a meaningful masterpiece and certainly significant theosophically, against the backdrop of most 80's vibrant/vapid offerings."
3,Punks Tryin to play Metal,"This is the worst of the 3 efforts by a great band of punk icons.From what I know even the Lords weren't very pleased.They were hoping to change with the times and make some money in the heavy metal market instead of doing what they do best. The production is really the worst part of it all.I think this is also the remastered version of Method to Our Madness which is even worse. As for the other reviewer, StevenMarque sounds nothing like the Lords and more like Cookie Monster. Shame on you! there are 2 new singers in the Lords and Steven is not one of them....(singer)"
5,I FOUND THEM AGAIN!!!,"I FIRST OWNED THE STATLER BROTHERS ""OLD TESTAMENT"" AND ""NEW TESTAMENT"" ON 33/RPM/LP. I PLAYED THE RECORDS SO MUCH I WORE THEM OUT. THEN I BOUGHT TWO CASSETTE TAPES OF THE SAME MUSIC, I WORE THEM OUT, BOUGHT TWO MORE CASSETTE AND WORE THEM OUT TOO!! NOW I FINALLY FOUND THEM ON TWO CDs. I AM SO HAPPY, I JUST RECEIVED THEM AND I FEEL LIKE OLD FRIENDS HAVE BEEN REUNITED! I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THIS ALBUM. IT IS FUNNY, SCRIPTURAL, AND DONE IN THE TIMELESS STYLE OF THE STATLER BROTHERS! I LOVE IT!!!"
5,Statler Brothers Holy Bible Old Testament CD,"After hearing Noah Found Grace In The Eyes Of The Lord, it brought back childhood memories to my son of what was then a record album we had. He decided he wanted to hear the entire album once again and requested it for his birthday. I was so glad that even though it was not available through Amazon, they offered ""Statler Brothers Holy Bible Old Testament"" through one of their private sellers. The CD I purchased from a private seller was new, so it was everything the seller promised. My son has listened to it many times since receiving it, and it has been the source of great conversation of wonderful family memories."
2,Interesting content but poor production quality,"Considering this is supposed to be a documentary about engineering, the production quality (at least on the online video from Amazon) is poor. Moreover, there are few closeups and so it is quite difficult to see in detail what the equipment is doing or how it works.On the other hand, what can be seen from the blurry, poor-quality and poorly shot images is very interesting. Lost of arcane machines performing specialized task in railroad track repair, like removing and replacing ties, hammering spikes, and aligning tracks."
3,An ok album,"I bought this for a friend, and am not the biggest Donna Summer fan. However, she is a great singer, and the purchase experience went well."
3,one of Donna's worst 70's albums,"I love Donna Summer's classic '70s albums, but this one is pretty boring in my book. Only 4 songs, three of them overly long. Mind you, I like a lot of very long, repetitive disco songs but I find that these tracks just don't have enough to make them interesting for 8 minutes each. This is definitely Donna's weakest album from the 1970s.The real reason to get this album is ""Winter Melody,"" a gorgeous ballad.This is a disc for only the true, hard-core Donna Summer fans who want all of her albums on cd."
4,Summer Season,"The only two adjectives that come to mind are dreamy and ethereal. While summer takes the listener through the four stages (seasons) of a romantic relationship one cannot help but notice how dream-like the concept is executed.Her falsetto voice is anything but annoying and suits the theme of the album exceptionally well.Spring Affair is every bit a take-off or homage the late great Marilyn Monroe who used to coo and whisper pure sexuality during a song. Summer Fever is another strong track that was ahead of it's time and that of Saturday Night Fever.As for Winter Melody, instead of being hit upon like a blizzard, it is a very tranquil and soothing track in an almost jazz-like rendition. The reprise was typical of almost any Donna Summer album of the early to mid 70's. Also traditional was that her albums did tell a story and would follow through with their thematic concepts instead of throwing in irrelevant loops or filler junk..."
3,Excellent!,"McFarlane has done it again with a fantastic looking Warrior Alien design from the movie, ""Aliens"". Has multiple bending joints, everything from the head, arms, chest, legs, knees, and feet. Only problem that I had was trying to make it stand, I actually had to put two small pieces of poster putty beneath the feet because the toy just would not stand by itself. You may have to set it against something. Other than that, its a fantastic design!"
2,Too Much Orchestral,"I guess I didn't adequately research this purchase. There are many nice cuts. Unfortunately, what I was not looking for were those several cuts with orchestra. Oh well. Not a total loss. After loading on iTunes, I can delete the ""offending"" tracks."
5,THE BEST,TINO PERFORMED IN THE TRI CITIES AT peppers he reminded me as a cross between stevie ray von and eric clapton.
1,"Stoppels no longer Mennonites, refute book in website","While studying the bible, Will & Vivian Stoppel began to notice some discrepancies between the teachings of Jesus and mennonite doctrines, including the fact that ALL who accept Jesus as their savior - mennonite or not - were brothers and sisters in Christ. They began expressing this belief, and on September 18, 2002, they were expelled from the mennonite church for ""heresy"".They have since started a website, www.theholdemans.com, where they discuss the errors in mennonite doctorine. In this site, they have an apology for the things they wrote in their books, including a chapter-by-chapter critique from Vivian Stoppel herself of this very book! This can be found at:http://www.theholdemans.com/apology.htm"
5,Cozy Mystery,"There's little better than a warn fire in the winter, a bowl of chocolate candy and a nice, cozy mystery with which to curl up on the couch. This book IS that mystery.I Adored Double Forte'. But if I ADORED that book, I'm not sure there are words to describe how very much I liked Upstaged! The character development continues to compel the reader forward. The storyline is fresh, exciting and new. The reader is transported into Lazar's imagination and taken on a journey with the author.An exciting thrill ride with a shocking ending!I don't give many 5 star ratings but this is Lazar's second five star rating for me. Look out world! Gus LeGarde has arrived!"
2,MAHLER AS ELEVATOR MUSIC,"Over the years I've acquired several CDs of Abbado conducting Mahler, more than enough to convince me that Abbado has no understanding of Mahler. Yet so many reviewers praised this DVD that I began to think I might be wrong, or that Abbado has matured. I wasn't. He hasn't. I'm at a loss to explain the rave reviews, save the one that calls this Second ""transporting."" Transporting it is, at least in the sense of being perfect elevator music. Abbado's Mahler is only for those who like their music fuzzy and unchallenging."
5,Mahler Symphony No.2 - Abbado with Lucerne Festival Orch.,"I have just received my copy of this great work. I am not a musician nor do I have significant music appreciation knowledge. However, I know what I like and what I don't like in classical music and this video blew me away! Aside from the high quality of the musical performance itself the DTS sound, the lighting, the camera work, and editing were suburb. Buy it, you can't go wrong."
1,A TDK defective DVD (almost the usual case with the TDK group),"Despite of all the 'Hoop-La-la' voiced by other ""reviewers"", the buyer should be aware that this RECORDING IS SEVERELY DEFECTIVE. The sound is truly compressed. The small voices instruments are blown-up within their sound-pressure-level, then they gets smaller in sound, then they get bigger in sound and when the whole orchestra gets into 'Tutti-Crescendo' the sound is recessed and tiny (IT IS COMPRESSED)as though TDK decided they will 'protect' your Audio speakers... Moreover; The bass attack is non existence, the drums are barely audible and the base-drum, oh, forget about the base drum it is missing altogether because of TDK's lower frequencies roll-off..To enjoy mahler 2nd symphony in good sound you better turn to the BOULEZ on DGG which is a much better affair in every aspect - sound AND vision."
5,magisterial Mahler 2,"This magisterial performance of the Mahler Second Symphony is certainly not barnstorming. Abbado adopts a measured tempo which allows the subtleties of Mahler's orchestration to emerge with great clarity. Although the initial movements are slow the work certainly does not drag. Of course Abbado is helped by having a superstar orchestra and excellent soloists who respond perfectly to his expert leadership. The symphony builds to an inexorable, spine tingling and shattering conclusion.Being able to see as well as hear the performance greatly enhances the experience of this uplifting music. Fortunately the sound and filming quality are first rate. Watching it on a good home theatre system is almost as good as being there."
4,Very good,"The orchestra, as expected, plays phenomenally. The problems are with the extras:1. The chorus remains seated until the a-capella men's declamando...rather unusual, but not a real problem.2. There is a raspy bass singer that does not blend in the chorus, and is prominent.3. During quiet choral passages, the blower on the pipe organ distractingly is too loud.4. The offstage brass are not recorded well.I feel that all of the energy of this performance is completed by the end of the third movement. The final movement just does not rise to stellar heights and loses steam.The Bernstein Laser Disc recording on DG had performance problems, but can hardly be faulted as the result was *electric.*However, the Abbado on DVD is not to be missed, as the orchestral playing is phenomenal.The video production team must have studied the Berstein DG Laser Disc, since there are many common elements, such as the orchestral highlighting via closeup."
2,Too much information,"Ever play golf with friends that want to be helpful by pointing out what you are doing wrong? It's fine as long as it doesn't exceed one or two pointers, but when you get forty or fifty things to correct, some of them in conflict with each other, how is this supposed to help?Maybe if you are a golf advice junkie this would be a good approach, but for me it was overwhelming. I went in to sensory overload and just stopped watching the DVDs.I cannot say that I got any pearls of wisdom from this series of DVDs, but I'll go back someday and finish watching them."
5,Great stuff.,"I've got easily a dozen books on Our Favourite Red Cars, but this is one of the best. Mr. Ludvigsen was given some pretty free access to the Ferrari works through the years and took full advantage of it. There's some good coverage of the early V8 cars, which I've always had a soft spot for.Be aware the pictures are all B&W;, but the content is fantastic. Highly recommended.Search out other stuff by Ludvigsen; if there's something he doesn't know about cars, it ain't worth knowing."
1,Piracy,"These are burn-overs from Columbia (Sony), RCA (BMG) and Chronogical Jazz Classics issues, by a parasitic piracy outfit operating in various parts of Iberia, with no fixed address because they have to stay on the lam. Beware.It is to be hoped that Sony-BMG will soon replace their over-noise-reduced issues of these great sides with modern remasterings. They are far less likely to do so while thieves like this undercut their sales. We live in a capitalist, not a free-for-all polity. Duke would never have made these records, rather would have gone back into sign-painting or selling insurance if people like this had been allowed to rip in the Thirties and Forties."
3,"Not a bad book, but I expected more","I really loved Davies' past work, and somehow I was hoping for more from this, his final novel. The book is not bad by any stretch, but it doesn't ""deliver"" in the same way that the books in his ""Deptford"" and ""Cornish"" Trilogies do. I found myself feeling slightly let down."
4,A life well lived,"The Cunning Man will never be mistaken for the finest work of Robertson Davies, and the reader new to Davies should definitely start with the Deptford Trilogy in preference to this volume. The Cunning Man's plot is paper-thin, and merely a device that Davies uses to share the wisdom that he has accumulated in a long, eventful life.A trifle from Robertson Davies is better than the best from most writers, and a reader of this book will be rewarded with an entertaining read, an introduction to some new philosophical ideas, and a knowledge of how one man has created a life worth living. One could do worse than to adopt Davies/Hullah's version of the Perennial Philosophy that `recognizes and reflects the Divine Reality in all things' as a guide to living life."
3,decent book,"the main character was a little too in love with himself. maybe that was the point. about 80% of the way through, i got bored and put the book away."
1,Disappointing Read from My Favorite Author,"I've read everything Robertson Davies ever wrote. He's my favorite author and I especially love his trilogies. However, this one was slow and boring. I didn't even finish it. The story wasn't engaging at all."
4,Canada dry mock,"This is my first encounter with Robertson Davies. I had never heard of him, and would not have read him if he weren't noted in the reader's list of the Modern Library's top 100 novels. And how unfortunate it would have been had I not picked up this book!The Cunning Man is an examination of the life of a doctor, told by himself. Asked to recall the story of the strange death of Father Ninian Hobbes which he witnessed, he recounts his past; his childhood, his schooling, the work of his profession, the influences that have made him who he is. In doing so, he shares with us his observations on the nature of life, love, art, illness, friendship, and many other things. Davies lets us have a picture of life, complete with accomplishments and disappointments, dreams and dreams undone, and makes it real and interesting and intelligent. I can understand the appeal he has for his fans and I will be reading more of Davies' books soon."
3,Justifiable Gloom And Doom,Whuff. This is a depressing book written by a depressed guy in depressed times. Wanna wander in the mire of gloom with an emotionally unstable intellectual? Bring the wellies.
4,Moving all the way to the end.,"I am not big on these type of movies, but I have to say this one moved me."
2,disappointed,"i was excited to hear that there was going to be a movie based on the other bolyen girl book. the book is from mary boleyn's point of view. the movie, however, follows the point of view of anne boleyn. the acting was good, and the costumes where great but i just wished that they had stuck to the book a little more closely."
2,Disapointment,"I love Phillipa Gregory's books, even the contraversial Wildacre Triology. I love Tudor-era books and movies. I'm a huge fan of Natlie Portman. But this movie is such an injustice to all three that I was forced to finish watching the moive by fast forwarding and stopping breifly at places that looked interesting. This from the first twenty minuites of 1x boredom.This moive is a tragedy to a beautiful, captivating book, and is not only historically inaccurtate (which, had it been good, I could have lived with) but entirely false to the book it was based upon. DO NOT watch unless bound and gaged and with access to much distraction to prevent yourself from concentrating too much on the awfulness that lies within."
3,alright,"I like period pieces and the two actresses, so I though it would be a good movie. The whole movie was a fight for the king. Wasn't that interesting."
4,Fiction is stranger than truth.,"Portman's performance is glorious.The screenplay's only flaw is the sexed up scenes.All in all, a great fictionalization that is well acted and delivered.The coustme design is perfection.The settings are gloriously lit and the cinematography is precise.This film, although perhaps not Oscar worthy, is entertaining."
1,Off with her head !!!,"What a terrible film. Can someone please tell Natalie Portman that her 15 minutes were over a long time ago. Why does she keep trying the horrible fake British accent? It's almost as bad as Madonna's .... almost! And her acting, well it's about as bad as the accent. Scarlett Johansson isn't much better. Both of them are so out of their element it's frightening. As for the film, it's a total mess. It blows so fast through the historical events that you don't care one iota about any of the characters except maybe for the poor British actors in the film who had to go to their trailers every day and bang their heads against the wall trying to figure out how to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."
1,Very Dissapointing,This movie was absolutely horrible. It was also a very big letdown after waiting for it to come out and then watch. Where was Wolsey in this? He played such an integral part in the lives of Henry VIII and Anne. I think they mentioned his name once. The movie was choppy and did not flow at all. It seemed as if the script was the result of the good idea fairy gone bad. Too much cognac at a cigar bar is not what makes good script. If you want a much better movie see Anne of a Thousand Days with Richard Burton and Genevive Bujold.
2,Eye Candy,"I bought this movie prior to seeing the Tudors which I recently bought and LOVE and way after Elizabeth. I know about poetic license but this pushed the envelope so far into make believe that I find it unwatchable now.The Tudors like Elizabeth both used poetic license BUT with superior writing and a stronger reference to history. Mary Boleyn was not the quiet, virginal (I don't want to go to court) girl portrayed in this film.Eric Bana is pure eye candy and the costumes are well done. After that there isn't much more to recommend this film. I did read the book and also found it to be poorly written fiction."
2,"Very historically inaccurate, but beautiful","What I liked about this movie is beautiful costumes, scenery, castles, etc. What I didn't, that many historical facts were missrepresented. Mary didn't visit her sister before her death; even though Anne was accused of incest, that was just a way for the king to marry his mistress with hopes to have a male heir. The king is shown as a guy overcome with passion for the evil calculating woman, but he had his motives for the male legite son in mind, when he anulled his marriage to marry Anne.And he married a few times after that too. Ironically, he did get his male heir, but he died too early to actually rule- even though officially he was a king for a while.To sum up- too much drama, too little historic truth, but lots of beauty."
1,Horrible depiction of a tremendously wonderful novel,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie. The direction was awful, and whoever wrote the screenplay should be highly ashamed of themselves. It does the book by Phillipa Greggory zero justice. The novel was wonderfully written, and I was really looking forward to seeing how the movie could portray the story. I recommend reading the book first, and perhaps even skipping the movie altogether. I believe with the right direction, production, and screenplay, this story could have been epic, for it is a partially true story, based on many recorded facts. Instead, we were served with a horrible depiction of a great novel. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AT ALL!"
2,NOT THE BEST!,"This movie wasn't horrible, but I have seen other movies that depict this story much better, ""Anne of The Thousand Days"" for example. But this movie focused on Anne Boleyn, King Henry VIII and his relationship with both her and her sister, Mary. The acting wasn't that great, and if you want to see a truly OUTSTANDING Anne Boleyn performance, check out Natalie Dormer in Showtime's The Tudors!!! They should have picked HER for the role in this movie!! I went to see it because I love anything to do with the Tudor period, especially Henry VIII. But it is certainly not the best I've ever seen."
2,"Slow, Boring & Trite.....","I am glad that I didn't buy this movie and only saw it on dvd rental. The acting and costuming were great, but the story was boring & slow to watch if not predictable. We all know that Anne Boleyn was going to marry Henry VIII and be killed in the end by her own hubby. At least the parts in between could have been a tad more interesting!"
2,Shallow Version,"None of the 3 principal characters had the gravitas to carry off their roles in my opinion. Especially Eric Bana. Normally I enjoy Eric Bana, but a Henry the VIII he is not.The other two girls (Portman, Johanssen) were only fair in their roles.The thing that really bugged me about this movie was the character of Mary Boleyn. In reality, she was not the meek, shy, virtuous girl portrayed by Scarlett Johanssen (the type of character she is not good at portraying anyway). Mary was a ribald character and was not at her sister's Anne's side faithfully thru all. In truth, the two sisters were not close.Too bad the film didn't choose to focus on the intense struggles between Rome and England, didn't go more into depth on Anne's fierce Protestant sympathies, and didn't delve into the remarkable personalities of Wolsey, Cromwell and Thomas More.This was more of a sentimental teenage version of the story (with major distortions) than anything else."
2,Poor representation,"This movie is inconsistent with any other history I have read or seen about Henry VIII and this period in England.The movie makes Mary out to be so innocent and timid when she is forced to go to the King's bed. Any others portray Mary as a wh*re in both the French Court and the English Court.The ""Movie Tie-In"" book by Gregory contains little to no similarities with the movie.The movie also makes very poor use of it's nearly 2 hours in providing any sort of in depth look into this period in Henry VIII's life."
2,This movie stunk,"I usually like all things that have to do with the Tutors or Anne Boleyn, but this movie didn't cut it.Most of the characters were miscast for one.The way the story was told stunk.I read the book ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and enjoyed that, but this movie version was a waste.Guess after seeing ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" so many times, I am spoiled. That is the best Henry 8/Anne Boleyn movie ever.Only reason this movie gets 2 stars is the costumes and scenery were nice to look at."
2,About what I expected...,"This movie was about what I expected of it - all hype and no substance. It was okay that it strayed from the book's plot, and the costumes were very good, but the story line and acting left a lot to be desired. It just doesn't show real passion in King Henry - for anything. Little to nothing is presented about Wolsey and the church, which would have given strength to the premise that the King went to the extent he did for Anne Boleyn. You just don't believe it. Johansson is nice, but Portman's acting is as flat as it was in Star Wars. I don't mind a different twist on a well known story, just make me believe it could happen!"
2,Agree with others - disappointing,"I have to agree with many others on my disappointment with this movie, glad that I saw it on my trans-atlantic flight so didn't waste a dime.It did focus the most on Anne, especially towards the end. I really wanted to learn more about Mary because she seems to be the forgotten sister. I was watching with a friend and the timeline in the 2nd half of the movie went by so quickly that I had to explain most of the jumble of scenes that were happening...she had no idea what it all meant.Definitely not one that I will be adding to my collection."
3,"Amazon Video Experience Great, Movie Bland","I was impressed with the ease and quality of Amazon's Instant Video system. The movie, on the other hand was totally dull."
4,Missing Something...,"I absolutely loved this movie, however there were scenes missing. I first saw this movie on TV. It was more than 2 hours long. Then when I purchased the DVD it was a lot shorter. I was really disappointed. I don't undersand why there is no option to view or purchase the movie with all the scenes included. These missing scenes were not part of the bonus features on the DVD either. But overall I enjoyed the film."
2,Not like the Book!,"I LOVE the book and all of the books by this author, however, in translating this story to the big screen, a lot of very pertinate details were lost. Also, the film makers changed the direction of the story and completely ignored some of the hard sort historicly based facts that make the book so addictive! My advice would be, if you've read the book DON'T watch the movie - you'll be dissapointed! If you haven't read the book, read it or watch the movie! As a piece in it's own right it is quite entertaining and the costumes, scenery and standard of acting are all really good!"
4,You'll probably like it better if you haven't read the book.,"As a movie on its own, it's really not bad. The sets were beautiful, the costume design was great, and it was well cast. As an adaptation of the book, it was just lacking. So much was left out, that the characters were shadows of what they were in the book. If you like the movie, you will love the book."
5,Excellent exciting DVD,Enjoyed the DVD from start to exciting finish. It came on time and in condition shown.
3,Soap Opera History,"The Bottom Line:A sudsy look at British history starring two Americans and an Aussie, The Other Boleyn Girl isn't out-and-out bad but it's so ""dramatic"" and hystrionic that few viewers (with the potential exception of middle-aged women) will find themselves sucked into the story and/or caring about the characters.2/4"
1,"What's worse than ""inaccurate""?","This movie is something far worse than historically inaccurate. It's just plain BORING. I'm a Tudor junkie from way back, and I nearly fell asleep watching this. A horrible script. At least Showtime's THE TUDORS is riotously good ridiculous fun."
2,Meh,"Ok, Scarlett and Natalie were excellent and beautiful, obviously. The gowns were lustrous and winning. Everything else was horrid, honestly. Henry was flat and uninteresting, and the plot...oh my god. It was not only completely historically inaccurate, but this is a case where history is by far more interesting and sexy than the movie! How is that possible? Ask Hollywood...."
2,Do Not Watch This Movie If You Read The Book,"If you have read the book this movie will be a huge disappointment, at least it was for me. I loved the book and held high hopes when the movie came out. It was the most awful movie adaption ever! Not only did they change the order of events they threw things in there that never even happened. Sure the movie was pretty, and the cast is great, but people who have read the book deserve better. I was ready to turn the movie off fourty minutes before the movie was due to end."
2,Pretty movie but disappointing! Reaffirms why books trump movies.,"Despite a beautiful cast, lovely costumes, and pretty settings, this movie was disappointing. I read the book first and you should, too. If you have read it, please note that this movie does no justice to the book aside from giving you some idea of what those times may have been like. That said, I don't ever expect movies to be as good as books but this one takes the cake. Honestly, such a disappointment - they manage to put in maybe 1/3 of the storyline. It gets two stars for trying and for aesthetics. Otherwise, it sucks. I wanted to like this movie b/c I am a sucker for period pieces. Unfortunately, I think the Tudors (on Showtime) is doing more justice to this period and the book itself than this adaptation. Moving on..."
1,And this was based on the novel in what way?,"The casting brilliant, the costuming obviously done in conjunction with the BBC, even the cinematography was superb, but it had NOTHING to do with Philipa Gregory's rather brilliant novelization of the most scintilating period of English history.I bought the film knowing that it would be at best a watered down version of the book, time constraints, ad nauseum, but I had hoped it would at least be coherant. It isn't.If one approaches the movie, forgetting that these people actually lived and changed the course of the Catholic Church in England, for a romantic escape, you should be well pleased. If you ARE familiar with the actual events; do NOT do this to yourself. An absolute waste."
1,B for Boleyn or Betty?,If you read the book then you are in for a huge disappointment. Anne is not played with half as much cunning as she is portrayed in the novel. The mother is something of a feminist and stands up for her children rather than plays a submissive woman. It is one thing to have so many historical inaccuracies but to have so many inaccuracies that relate to the novel as well is just ridiculous. Why make the crappy movie at all?The costumes are beautiful. The Americans trying to mingle with the British is okay. I also think it a bit funny that Anne's necklace is the same one that can sometimes be seen worn by America Ferrera's character on Ugly Betty. I'd rather watch Ugly Betty anyway.
1,movie buff,very slow a true dud i asked my sister did she want it. i wanted it out of collection so bad i asked if i can pay her to pick it up. she did not thou sent it to her in the mail.
1,The book was better,"I will keep it short and simple. The movie was beautiful in its good acting and cinematogrophy, but the book is better by a longshot. Save your time for something better, SKIP THE MOVIE AND READ THE BOOK! The book is amazing."
1,Absolutely horrible,"The only way this horrible movie could be more historically inaccurate is if they said it took place in another country with monkeys or something. The producers intend to show how women in a different era were debased for ambition. But with their historical inaccuracies they once again debase Anne Boleyn but on a much wider scale then Henry VIII could've dreamt. He was in reality a narcissist and serial adulterer who would kill or accuse a wife of anything to be rid of her. This movie claims a lot of the rumors he created about Anne were true and reported by people without machiavellian motivations. In the process they debase a woman who happened to be vaguely successful in her ambitions, while rewriting history to glorify women of the court who lived dark and petty lives. Phillipa Gregory and the producers should all get jobs at McDonalds. The product would be about the same."
1,Disappointment,"I read the book prior to watching the movie. I couldn't put the book down, it was phenomenal! So I thought...I must watch the movie when it comes out. The movie was a major disappointment. The acting was par, the character's stories were vague. All in all- Not so great."
4,The Other Boleyn Girl,"This was an enjoyable film that had substance but did not measure up to the, fine TV series, The Tudors."
5,Great,Read the book so wanted to watch movie it arrived in great order and played great. I Loved watching it!!
3,"Fun & Pretty To See, but Historically??","As some others have said, this is a gorgeous film to watch! But, historically, umm....well, it's sure a gorgeous film to watch! I fully understand taking license with history for dramatic purposes, but this is a mess. And couldn't ""they"" have found either some actors/actresses from Great Britain or at least some with more plausible English accents?In essence, I'd say this: it's fun to watch and beautifully filmed, but if it's history you're interested in, better head to the English history section of your local bookstore; this flick won't help."
1,What was this....?!,"This was about the longest movie ever made, and there was no acting in it at all. Johanson, Portman, Bana....all were miscast and directionless."
2,About that rape...,"Fun fact! The screenwriter, Peter Morgan, who adapted this film also wrote the 2003 Henry VIII series starring Ray WinstoneHenry VIIIand guess what?! The Anne Boleyn Rape Scene is IDENTICAL. Well, except that it's big ol' scary Ray Winstone raping the hell out of Helena Bonham Carter.What the hell, Peter Morgan? Why you hatin' on Anne Boleyn enough that you keep having her get raped by Henry VIII? She lost her head, historically, do you really feel the need to re-write history and have her molested in the bargain? Pump the breaks, maniac."
2,Read the Book,"This is a perfect example of why one should read the book first. In this case Philippa Gregory's Boleyn books provided just the right mix of history and speculation to make for an indulgent read. The movie however was exhaustingly boring. I could hardly wait for Anne to be without head. I find Natalie Portman generally a pleasure to watch. In this role she was simply silly, unbelievable both as a tricky temptress and/or a victim. The larger casting error here was Scarlett Johansson. She is unconvincing at best in this period piece. I suspect as with her singing, if the audience cannot be distracted by her breasts her lack of talent really shines through. This movie was visually attractive with out be screaming big budget. More character development may have resolved the casting errors. Or not."
2,Loads of sex on pretty sets,"Well, yes, the actors, sets, costumes and cinematography are very pretty, but the film bored me to tears. Showtime's Tudors moves along better and keeps the watcher more involved, with plenty of sexy stuff to boot. Other than a boatload of historical inaccuracies, the funniest thing about the movie was that they spoke American English. A dudd in my book..."
5,Interesting,"I quite enjoyed this movie and i think the casting was great. I like the different twist (focus) of this movie vs. all the stories told before. The acting, costumes and feel of the movie were also really great. I would for sure recommend it to anyone who likes any of the three main actors/actresses and/or the story of Ann Boleyn."
2,Wait for this on cable!!,"Sadly, this movie lived up to its poorest reviews. If the producers had made this film with a bit more historical accuracy about the Boleyn gals, it would have been soooooo much better. They were quite an interesting bunch, without the need to embellish or dilut facts."
2,"save your money, read the book!","this movie was such a let down! but maybe i had such high expectations due to the book being so amazing. the movie moved way too fast and left out the best parts of the book. i know it couldn't be exactly like the book, but my gosh. the movie was supposed to be more about mary than anne but was vise versa. the thing that pisses me off the most is that the movie left out mary and william strafford's whole love story! such a shame. i gave it 2 stars bc the senery was pretty, and i love this time period. other than that it was a dissapointment."
3,a lukewarm experiment,*The Other Boleyn Girl* is a beautiful Hollywood production which has nothing to do with true history.Many important facts are incorrect and in addition to this some of them have never happend in history.If Justion Chadwick would have stuck to true history this movie could have been terrific.Contrary to the interessting Tudor-history this movie is a lukewarm experiment.In my opinion this movie comes in the same league as *Elisabeth* and *Elisabeth: The Golden Age*. The director Shekhar Kapur presents history after his own fashion as well as Justin Chadwick in *The Other Boleyn Girl*.Because of the mutilated history I cannot recommend this film.The only things worth seeing are the costumes and the acting ability of the actors.
4,"Nice movie, not historically accurate","I was so happy when this came out on film because I loved the book. The book this movie is based on is historical fiction so I knew it was not going to be historically accurate but this movie does take some facts and stretch them pretty far. So if your looking to learn something about Anne Boleyn don't go to this movie. But this movie is very entertaining and the costumes are perfect. You did get a sense of what it was like during that time period and what the two girls went through. There are some nice special features as well. Yes, this movie is historically inaccurate, but all movies are unless they are a documentary. So if you keep in mind this is a movie to ENTERTAIN you, then you will enjoy it. Natalie Portman does a great job as Anne Boleyn."
4,Sisterhood and Rivalry,"I haven't read Philippa Gregory's novel, from which this film was adapted, so I saw the film without any expectations.I personally enjoyed the film; the Tudor costumes are amazing and the scenery beautiful. Although I didn't get `attached' to any of the characters, I thought the complex relationship and rivalry between the two sisters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) was well portrayed. Perhaps if there was more individual character-development, the audience may have felt more compassion towards them.In the film, King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) is desperate for a male heir, which his current wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) has failed to bear.The Boleyn girls Anne and Mary are put forward, by their scheming father and uncle, to satisfy the king. This starts a chain of events that ends with the fall of the Boleyn household."
3,Better book than movie,"The Other Boleyn Girl is a fabulous book. I believe I have read it 3 times. I live overseas and didn't see the movie in the theater, I was so looking forward to this movie on DVD, I preordered. Couldn't wait to watch it when it arrived. The first 20 minutes I kept waiting for it to get better, it never did. The costumes were sumptuous, scenery was gorgeous, acting was shallow, plot line limped along. If you are not a big fan of the book, don't bother with the movie. Try Anne of a Thousand Days instead!"
2,Disappointing,I read the book before watching the movie and this movie was completely disappointing. Read the book
2,A Better Choice is Anne of the Thousand Days,"Forget buying The Other Boelyn. A better choice is Anne of the Thousand Days. The story is told with a far superior script, and cinematography. Richard Burton as King Henry VIII is outstanding. Eric Bana's performance pale's in comparison. An extra reason is that the outstanding movie Mary, Queen of Scots is included on a second DVD. It is a real bargain."
1,Tabloid mishistory,"Anyone with knowledge of Anne and Mary Boleyn and their relationships with Henry VIII will see that this is tabloid fiction, pure and simple. The timetables and events are total fabrications. Yes, Anne was alleged to have had relationships with her brother. But to see this depicted as fact in this movie? Well, just look at the costumes. I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good."
2,Wow,"this should be called ""the story of Anne plus one other chick we don't care about"" The completely destroyed what was so great about the book (this is based on). Portraying Henry as a rapist, and Mary and Anne's mother as a love-stricken women who only wants the best for her kid. HA!Well at least the costumes are great."
1,boring,"The only positive thing to say about this bad movie is that the costumes arewell done. The script is terrible, the acting is wooden, the interiors dark with lots of fireplaces. Eric Bana is not lustful, and there is no sex to speak of. There is no comparison with the lively sexy fast-moving Tudors on cable television."
3,"Okay, but see HBO's the Tudors for real drama.","The drama was weak compared to the Henry VIII story line in HBO's the Tudors. In this story, Henry visits the Boleyns, falls off his horse in a ride with Ann (NP), injuries nursed by recently married untitled mans wife Mary(SJ) who is then asked to come to court (gives husband job), takes Mary to his bed, she eventually becomes pregnant and Henry's eye continues to wonder (to Ann) who teases Henry with flirts yet rejects his gifts. It glosses over the separation of England from the Roman Catholic Church as well as the religious and political turmoil, and treasonous plots other than adultry and thus becomes boring. Ok for a 2 hour rent."
3,I wish the ending was better.,I want to give it 5 stars but the fact that the ending and like 2 other minor things really pissed me off wont let me do it. The story would have been great if the king recognized the unfair mistake he made with the first boleyn girl. They made him so weak and stupid. The first boleyn girl gave him what he wanted and then he let's himself get used like a puppet by a stupid power hungry leech. This movie had super great potential. I loved the love scene and love story between the king and the first boleyn girl and then they riuned it ;-(
2,Disappointing!,"I also read the book, loved it and couldn't wait for the movie. This one is disjointed from beginning to end and the ""acting"" is just what it is -BAD ACTING! The dialogue is cliche and the emotions unbelievable. Is it really that hard to at least learn a British accent for a period piece?? The other reviews already told the rest. The Tudors is 10 times better than this train wreck and the book is 100 times better. No wonder it made it to DVD so fast!!"
3,okay...,"Loved the movie the first time I saw it. Then I read the book which was great, and watched the movie again. Now I realize how much it leaves out, and I ended up explaining everything to to my family who didn't read the book."
2,Awful,"Anyone who likes their history accurate will be very disappointed in this movie. By the way, the book by Phillipa Gregory is not much better. The three main actors are beautiful to look at, but that is about all. As other reviewers have done, I recommend ""Anne of a thousand Days"" and ""The Tudors"" starting with series II, if you really are interested in the life of the Boleyns'."
3,ok movie,Movie was ok. I should not have read the book first. The movie left so much out. The acting was good though.
3,I liked it,I think it was worth watching. I like both Nataly and Scarlet's performances. It make me want to know more about king Henry VIII and search his history. Nice way to motivate learning!
2,The other Boleyn girl,In 2 hours nobody can really get the story as given in the book.Movie was about Henry's word of honor. Book was about the sisters and Henry's affair. I was dissapointed with the movie version.
3,"love the actors, but the story...","I love the actors, but since I'm not familiar with the book (I read half of it years ago and thought it was pretty boring compared to Alison Weir or Jean Plaidy), I don't know if the historical content is skewed because of the book or the movie. I went along with the inaccuracies for most of the movie because I adore the actors. However the whole ""Anne slept with her brother George"" was the plot point that had me putting the DVD back in the Netflix envelope. Having read a number of books on this subject, most authors and scholars see that charge against Anne Boleyn as false, only a means for Henry to execute her and make way for the next wife."
5,"Great, EASY to use product",This is exactly the type of product I was looking for. I was contantly annoyed by having to switch between listening to certain music on CD's through my stero and others on MP3s on my computer. Now I just have one product that allows me to listen to my whole music collection.Unlike some of the other readers I found this product easy to setup and use. I love it!
2,Too little for too much...,"Unless you're a real gadget fiend, save your money and buy and x-box. Doesn't do all of what this thing does, but it fails to do so at about half the price. :) What it DOES do is provide a good chunk of song storage and a digital output, plus you can use it to play games. I'll bet in 4 months somebody will have build a CDDB-capable front end for it as well.If you *are* a real gadget fiend, just use the money to build a silenced Celeron PC without a monitor for the same cost or less (""Too cheap to display"" indeed!) and get the same or better quality with more storage space and greater flexibility. Sure, you'll have trouble finding a black slimline case, but otherwise I don't see much here that you couldn't do yourself."
5,Great Salsa CD,I love Albita and if you like Salsa - you will love this CD!!! Great Salsa Music. she's a pro!
4,A scandal laid bare,"Same-Sex Affairs is a fascinating look at the rise of urban homosexuality in the early 20th Century.The book is built around the 1912 YMCA Scandal in Portland, Ore., a little known and poorly documented story that dominated newspapers of the day, in particular E.W. Scripps' newspaper, The Portland News.Using many never-before seen historical documents, this book details the politics and pressures in Progressive Era Portland on the homosexual community. Further, it shows that politics played a far bigger role than sexuality in the scandal.An academic treatment of this important event, done in the finest fashion, Same-Sex Affairs is a great addition to any library."
2,Everything You Need To Know- I Already Knew...,"I thought this book was a complete waste of money! This book mentioned very few reception sites in each state. The reception sites that were mentioned were sites that anyone from the New York area would be aware of. If you're from the NY Metro area you probably won't benefit from this book. I did give ""Everything You Need to Know to Have a Wedding in N. Y., N. J., CT"" 2 stars because I'm sure it would help someone who is NOT from New York plan a New York wedding."
2,not so thoroughly researched,"I used this book and found a few great resources through it. I was disconcerted by the lack of research done by the staff, however. One Brooklyn photographer had never shot a wedding before but said she was put in the book because she had done good editorial work that one of the researchers knew about. I used an ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING videographer, Maria Quiroga, whose name I got from the book. Quiroga's prices were TOTALLY OFF in the book, however, and Quiroga had never been contacted by the authors. She was surprised to see her name listed. The book also listed the Chemist's Club, which is a pretty little place, but too small for all but the smallest weddings. Meanwhile, the Yale Club, which is near to it, larger and cheaper was left out. Emphasis is also on high end wedding vendors who are easy enough to find on own's own."
4,Great advice for the real world,"Work It is the perfect job search book for the current economy. It's full of real world, practical advice that can be used by both first time job hunters and experienced professionals alike. I especially like the section on what to do if you are laid off. This is advice I have not been able to find anywhere else, and I appreciate the straightforwardness. Work It! should be on any new grad's reading list!"
1,Where is the preview of the contents?,I will probably not buy this book unless I see a preview of the contents.
4,A Good Read!,"Allison Hemming, who heads an interim workforce agency, discusses strategies you can use to get employed. She focuses primarily on entry level jobs and directs her advice to younger workers, especially those affected by the tight job market (hence the sassy, but unnecessarily tacky, sub-title). However, the basics of her technique can be applied by most job seekers. Hemming writes with an authoritative air, using a casual style to appeal to younger, hip workers, although her job hunting principles sound fairly basic. Note the book's tips on techniques to avoid and alternate techniques to pursue. She suggests niche searches on the Internet, targeted resumes and extensive networking. It's not very flashy but, nowadays, as job hunting increasingly becomes an extreme competitive sport, We recommend taking all the solid advice you can get."
2,Don't be fooled by great photography,"Whoever shot the photos for this bag did a great job - the bag was not as nice as it looked in the photos. It also did not fit the oversized laptop that it seemed it would. The wheels didn't seem like they would take much abuse, and the organizer pockets were cheap plastic. It earns points for color selection and for the handle. All in all, I sent it back despite the fact that the eBag policy is to only give a partial refund."
1,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for",The wheels on the bag lasted less than two months. The bag is now basically unusable.
4,A great and underrated composer,"For far too long Weiss has been the province of guitar and lute specialists/scholars. This music is so deep, complex and beautiful-in spirit, something like Bach's solo keyboard music-that a listener can truly become lost in it. I hope that more people become acquainted with Weiss, thanks to Barto's superb performances and Naxos's exemplary sound. This, and the other volumes in the series, are not to be missed. Terrific bargains, too."
3,What Happened???,"What happened to this game??? Galactic Battlegrounds is not worth the retail value. It has bad graphics, boring single player campaigns and missions, and is totally unrealistic. However, the game is not completely shot to hell. The only good thing I find about this game is the multiplayer. People make their own scenarios which are really fun to play and there are very few star wars nerds playing it also. The game isn't the best and could have certainly been made better."
4,It was Great.....,"The game is a classic strategy game that makes you think. I found the game to be fun and challenging at first, however, after playing it for several months im not nearly as interested as i was before. I wish that there were more vehicles and units, like with the rebels. Why not have a-wings and b-wings too? it would at least make it more interesting. I think that the way the civiliztions were this time made it even better than Age of Empires II. IT would be an even better game with more civiliztions. I'd like to see the hapans, and others."
3,enough with the ground battles,"yes i will admit that this game was fun. but it seemed to me that they made this to redeem themselves for Force Commander. and they succeeded, somewhat. the fact that it is almost identical to AOE is enough for me not to like it. and when will we see other games like Star Wars Rebellion. i still enjoy dominating the galaxy with this antique. with modern gaming systems a ""Star Wars Rebellion 2"" would kick butt. maybe set in the Thrawn series? or maybe the Yuuzhan Vong invasion perhaps..."
2,SLOW GAME,I was hoping this game....even though it is on the same engine as Age Of Empires 2.....would pull away from how slow and long AoE2 is. But no. Average game is like 45mins. I am more of a Star Craft player where you can beat someone in like 15mins....20 on avarage. Sure some game last an hour or 2 in SC but not ALL of them. I waited and waited for this game and even bought it somewhere in it's 1st month of shelf like.....disappointment.
5,"Dude, whats your problem?","How can you review a game that HASN""T COME OUT YET. Sides, the system specs are really low...."
1,This game stinks,Don't be fooled by the looks of this sorry excuse for a game. I bought it and played it for 2 days and chucked it. It has the WORST!!!Graphics out of any game I've played. Might as well get Barbie Sea Adventures. Trust me on this one. it stinks.
5,Star wars galactic battlegrounds is awsome!!!!!!,Star wars galactic battlegrounds is awsome!!!!!! the game has good grafics and is fun to play. they teach you how to play in the menu.to make it better you should get an expantion like star wars galactic battlegrounds the clone compainion.
3,Too Clunky,"Yeah, it is Star Wars, but ... it leaves a lot to be desired. Units run off and do idiot things, there is no move and attack function, the scenarios are alternately ridiculously easy and horrifyingly complex, with no real middle ground. It has the Star Wars name, but that is about it."
3,the pc game equal to star wars chess,"Ok, you know how companies will take a well known game like chess or monopoly and use a trademark characters to create special editions? Well Galactic Battlegrounds should be titled:Age of Empires: Star Wars editionThis is the Age of Empires II core engine down to the T. All they have done is swap out the graphics, sounds and menu items.It's that bad and it works about as well as Starwars chess or Starwars monopoly in the end. Still, it seems the best Star Wars titles from Lucus Arts are developed off some other companies successful game engines, and this game is much better than Force Commander.Buy if you must."
1,I think that this one is a stinker...,"Picture this; I am in a huge hurry to get this off my hard drive as it is a big disappointment! I was looking forward to something new and this is what I get?? Mid ninties graphics and tired RTS gameplay! I can't imagine what they were thinking when they announce they were using an upgraded version of the AoE engine. Some may like this title, at least one can use the editor to design their own scenarios. I am waiting for Empire Earth and already own Battle Realms and will pitch this baby right out the door to get the stench out of my gaming room."
2,"well, well...","To the Aussie who was a little bit rude: if the game isn't out yet, how can you say it's gonna be good if the game isn't out yet? If a game like FOCOM was a lemon, and it has all the big anticipation like GBG, why should I write good things about a game similar to FOCOM ? FOCOM has a problem with compatibility with video/sounds cards, it has nothing to do with the specs of any PC, that's why everybody hated FOCOM. Try to understand first and then criticize about spelling, 'mateTo the others: Yes, I haven't played the game, but is sad that a great company like LucasArts cannot come up with something better than AOE2, perhaps when the game arrives, then all reviews would be valid or not...we shall see..."
5,Played the demo...,"...buying the game.It is very easy to rate a game that has not been released...it is called playing the demo.I was sceptical of this game, given LA's recent PC games...but this game blew me away.The gameplay mirrors that of AoE:AoK, and the graphics are amazing! It uses true soundbites that are well timed and meaningful.It really is going to be worth the money for this fun game."
5,Just awesome!,"This game is great. Actually Lucas Arts has come with a whole new line up of great games like it hadn't in a long time.The game has every aspect an RTS needs to be a classic. Graphically it is is great, if you have played Age of Empires you'll know more or less its gameplay style, which is very cool.It has a great editor with lots of features, so you'll be able to customize many aspects from the game.In summary, it's a must have for a Star Wars fan, a great choice for an RTS gamer, and every player should give it a try!"
3,So Repetitive!,"StarWars: Galatic Battlegrounds is a great PC game, however not the best StarWars game on the PC, not by a longshot. However the game is very easy to get into. You can play the scenarios or create your own where you can add characters from the movie. The sound effects are straight from the movie, there are a lot of characters from the expanded universe of StarWars which you may have to reference from the StarWars website for more background info on them. The cons of the game come from the feeling of ""been there, done that,"" especially if you've played Age of Empires or Age of Kings to death. The gameplay becomes too repetitive and the replay value goes straight to hell. But it's a good game just realize that one day it's going to end up on the shelf with the rest of the games you've long since stopped playing."
4,Age of Empires 3???,As an avid Star Wars fan I was extremely excited for the release of this game. I knew it would have some AOE flare based on the screen shots but I underestimated just how much flare it'd have. There's even a paragraph in the manual that addresses AOE players. Avid AOE players may find themselves getting board after the first few games because the play is almost identical but the die-hard Star Wars fan will find hours of endless enjoyment and uninstall AOE forever. Way to go Lucasarts!
3,another disapointment,"I love the Star Wars games, I have almost all of them (excluding the elusive Rebellion) and from games like X-wing I've not to expect quite a lot. Unfortunately the latest load haven't been... well, good. They haven't been [bad], but they fail in comparison. I think it all started with X-wing Vs. Tie Fighter, story is obviously no longer present and voice acting [is not good]. This game is slow and boring, just like Age of Empires, of course if you like the mass unit no strategy, takes three hours to win kind of game, then you will love this."
3,Is Good,"Bought 2 games at the same Time, Starwars BG and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Although different tyoes of games Wolf get the most gameplay 5 to 1."
1,Old Generation Poo Poo,"I never bought this, but did download the online demo. Was that supposed to impress me? ACK! I wouldn't pay good money for this game. Like the editorial review says, the graphics are Outdated (EXTREMELY) and flat. I expect more from RTS games these days with folks like westwood setting the bar. This looks like a game you might have considered playing five years ago. I guess if you are a hardcore fan you'll enjoy this, but I found the downsides to the game too much to consider shelling out any clams for the game. Gameplay is somewhat poor. Sounds quality is cheesy and sounds like it was lifted from a bad HBO copy of A New Hope.The box looks sharp, but don't let it fool you, it isn't worth your time. Try JK II; Outcast instead and wait till they decide to make a real Star Wars RTS."
1,Lucas Arts has gotten lazy!!,"This game is an absolute waste of time! Lucas Arts totally dropped the ball on this one. The game is a ... ""mod"" of Age of Empires. Bad graphics and micro-management have made it sadly unplayable. The entire game is spent slowly moving units around the map and cutting down trees. (Why do you need trees to build X-wing fighters anyway?!?!?) Please save your money for a decent game like Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Maybe Lucas will pay everyone back for buying this stinker of a game..."
3,How original can lucas be ?,"I see for what i've played that the one can he be not very original... Hummm let me see at my game rack.. ah i see patience my friends all will be said... Oh i see here Age of Empire, Age of Kings and Starcraft.This game is the exact copy of those game all together, with positive and negatives sides.Lucas Lucas on your movies explosions are great but in the games that intensity falls down a liitle. Wake up and smell the coffeelook at other gane around you like starcraft and Homeworld were the explosion are a blast... Rejeuvenize your team and get someinfografists and programers around 20-27 years old.Just one more thing if i ever see you create game like Force Commander or Rebel Assault 2 i am personnaly demonstrate my jedi powers to ya..."
4,Old John,The book Old John by Elizabeth D. Crawford is a fasinating and cool book. Some of the parts where sad and other were happy. The book is a bout a family that wanted their grandfather to come visit them. The only problem was that insted of visiting he comes into the Schirmers yard with a moving van to live with them. The Schirmers are the main family. They where sort of mad at John came but they calmed down. Father was upset at Old John because one he only wanted him to stay for a while and plus the house was way to small to fit five people. The kids Jacob and Laura love their grandfather becuase he tells them stories about his past. This book is for anyone who just loves to read.
2,It's Old,"This book is easy to read. But you may get confused about what Old John said because he always pronounced the words wrong. This story is funny but the end of the story is sad. This book doesn't have a main point, because the story start with Old John moves to his son house, and finally he... At the middle of the story they are happiness, sad, arguing, love and confusing. I can't recommend this book to all the people, because it for a people that likes about relationship between family, not for a people that likes nightmare or fighting story. I will recommend this book to a person that has English as a second language and not interest to read a book."
3,too small,I bought this to go with my mini muffin pan. They should be good according to my measurement. But they are too small. Maybe I don't know how to measure the muffin pans?
2,not much of a fan,"I tried, I really did. But it just didnt keep my attention. It sits there and I just dont pick it up! I dont know that i ever will either. I liked the title and had wanted the book for a while. it reads like the journal of a very naive lady in the 1930's-1950's. its one dimensional. perhaps thats the point, but it just wasnt for me."
3,procaine,"Hola amigos.: Estoy buscando literatura para la aplicacion de la procaina en terapia neural, soy medico de profesion y me interesa saber mucho de este tipo de aplicaciones, tengo mi clinica de medicina natural y deseo tener literatura al respecto. Gracias de antemano por su respuesta. Dios los bendiga."
5,HOT SMOOTH SWEDISH ELEKTROPOP,"Dag, this is some smoothed out hotness.Futuristic, tight, it takes you away to what earth would be without pollution of negativity.Float on the BTV cloud, baby!"
4,Lakehouse movie and soundtrack,"I did see the movie recently. Has some interesting and funny moments. The soundtrack was great. I am a fan of Nick Drake. I don't know all the soundtracks that Rachel Portman has done but I loved the soundtrack from ""Chocolate"" which she also produced music for.I liked the Carol King soundtrack which has a little more of an upitty, jazzy beat.The movie was ok, The ending left me saying, ""Ok, What was that?"" Other people leaving had the same reaction. It was strange and bizarre. But taking it as the love story it is, it is good. The soundtrack is definately worth purchasing and definately something you would want to relax to or if you are feeling a bit on the melancholy sort of side."
1,Please help! Certain piano piece...name the artist/s,"I don't know if anyone else noticed in the soundtrack...but there was a piano piece (excluded from the soundtrack and NOT written by Rachel Portman whom everyone seems to be so impressed with...to each his/her own) I unfortunately cannot place the exact scene it was cued. I want to say the artist/s was Cinematic Orchestra or Medeski Martin Wood. Heck, I think I even have the CD but my collection is in storage (go figure). I know that I've not given any detail but if you just take a listen I believe you'll understand why I'm searching for that particular piece. It's unbelievably moving...melancholy, and possibly sad to some. I rate the soundtrack one star because ALL the music should have been included. I'm certain there are reasons for their exclusion but I find it such an aural tease! If there is anyone out there with a keen ear for the obscure...please contact me and perhaps we solve the mystery and relieve my clouded mind."
3,Lake House soundtrack CD,"This is nice music, but the important pieces from Brad Meldau and Rosemary Clooney are missing. They, along with the Sir Paul McCartney and Carole King pieces, are available on other media, but that begs the question: why buy the soundtrack, if it's not all the music from the movie?"
2,Ulitmately Disappointing,"This soundtrack continues a disturbing trend in recent movie soundtrack releases: much of the movie's music -- often the best music -- is NOT on the CD. As much as I like Rachel Portman, I have to agree with the reviewers below: I'm disappointed that Rosemary Clooney's two songs aren't included. The only reasons to buy this CD are Paul McCartney, Carole King, and the Clientele, and you can probably get those songs on one of their recordigs. Interesting too, that you can't get those songs individually on I-Tunes -- you have to download the entire album. I smell a rat. In either format, don't waste your money."
5,The Lake House,Wonderful music from the movie. The songs are soft and romantic. Someting special for a quiet evening at home or while in the car driving in traffic to keep you calm. I loved it.
5,Great Movie,"When I first saw this movie in the theater I didn't like it. Now, the more I see it the more I love it...it's just one of those movies that grows on you."
1,More Missing Songs,"In addition to the missing songs noted by other reviewers below, how do you run commercials featuring ""Somewhere Only We Know"" by Keane and yet not include the song in the movie and soundtrack? That song really gives the commercial a good feel and tells a great story itself that could easily be related to the story the movie is conveying."
5,"outstanding, totally outstanding","It's one week now that i've had the chance to listen to this totally amazing record. All the tracks are totally outrageous and feels so genuin. The lyrics could feel sort of complicated the first time you hear them but the more you listen to them, the more they grow.You gotta have this almbum 'cause it is a genius piece of modern art that will become more and more uncommon in this conmercelized age."
3,good but my some like the black one better,My dad bought this for my 6 year old son for halloween. My son already had a black that he likes more. He wore this one when it was new once but switched back to the black costume that he loves.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this costume because it said it included shoe covers. That's all my son talks about....needing shoe covers! When it came, it was a regular costume with no shoe covers. I'm sure the costume itself is fine, but I did not get what I paid for.When I sent a complaint e-mail, I received no response from this seller."
1,Too small.,"My son is 11-years-old and wears a 12-slim pants. The description claims they are for 11-14 but the packaging says 12-14. At any rate, this costume is so tight on him it's embarrassing even without using the spongey chest and abs insert. And he's a skinny kid. Also, the mask is made out of some type of spongey material. I think an elastic cloth would've been a better choice. He can't even wear the mask because he can't breath with it on and it smooshes his nose. If your child is maybe 9- or 10-years-old, this might be a good choice, however."
1,Dead battery,"Battery arrived in a thin plastic bag as a mailer. The battery had no bubble wrap. The package did have a ""fragile"" sticker on it. My hope is that an elephant didn't sit on it through the mail process. I thought maybe these guys buy the batteries in bulk and sell them one at a time, but without some kind of impact cushion? Ok, it's Christmas. They're busy. I charged the battery for over a day. Still dead. Are they selling dead batteries?"
4,Good Deal,Received batter in good time and so far it works as good as expected. Would purchase another item from this retailer.
4,Love at the Mental Hospital,"Alba's crazy. Oscar's a druggie. Nevertheless, in spite of all their problems, perhaps because of all their problems, Alba and Oscar meet at the mental hospital and fall in love.I like books about mental illness. I like books about redemption and healing. And I like books with a little romance in there somewhere. This book has all of these."
3,Dial a Genre,"It is so amazing that most of DS's albums are medleys. The original side one plays non-stop. This is Miss Summer at her most Las Vegas. It is not a masterpiece like it's predecessor Once Upon A Time, but it has the greatest electronic dance song of all time on it, I FEEL LOVE. It has lots of campy girl group references and some of the songs are just plain bad, Back in Love Again and Black Lady instantly come to mind. It all seems like it was a neccessary step forward to reach the masses with her blockbuster Bad Girls."
5,I Remember The Disco Concept Album!,"Disco and concepts made great bedfellows,since the averagedancer didn't enjoy their dance's interupted.On the first sideof ""I Remember Yesterday"" Summer takles Dr.Buzzard-like big banddisco in the tital track,the 60's girl group pop of ""Love's Unkind"" followed by the Motown sound of ""Back In love Again"".Evenif they don't spill into eachother,the songs on side A all sequewithout breaks making it another a potent dance suite and Donna choose to actually sing these songs rather then ""breath"" them-showing the world what a great singer she really is.Side B isa whole other animal with the blackploitation-like ""Black Lady"",the Stevie Wonder sounding ""Take Me"" and a torch ballad sung intrue Streisand style ""Can't We Just Sit (And Talk It Over?)"".Thencomes ""I Feel Love"",the minimalist,Kraftwerkesque electronica album ender in which Donna'a angelic falsetto dips,rises and peaks like a phantom opera singer caught inside a computer hardrive"
5,Wonderful product,It is like having a spa treatment in a jar. Well worth the purchase. Highly recommend Lavender Batherapy.
1,My Disc Is Not This Game But A Movie,"I ordered this game as a Christmas gift and when my son went to play it, it is not the football game but a movie is on the disc instead. Has anyone else experienced this? The movie is, 13 Going On 30, and there is not a PS2 game on this disc. Needless to say I am trying to get my money back from the Amazon seller but this is extremely maddening. I do not understand how such a mistake could be made by the manufacturer and not caught."
4,This Game is Awesome!,"This game is amazing! The new features are way better than ever before! From the home-field advantage to the create a fan, this game has really improved over the year! I think that any diehard college football fan should buy this game! I know I am going to buy it, and I'm gunna have a lot of fun playin my friends and family!"
2,Change for Change Sake,"Disappointed with the new changes. I am a big fan of the EA College Football series and expected 2005 to be an improved version of the 2004 game. Not the case. While EA has added cool new features (described in other reviews on this site), they made exiting parts of the game worse. Loads times are dramatically increased. The best offensive plays from the 2004 playbooks are not in the 2005 playbooks. Recruiting has been improved by new features and worsened by changes that have no apparent reason (perhaps so we'll feel were getting an entirely different game). The recruiting interface is dramatically worse (i.e. more cumbersome). My message to EA would be ""we love EA college football, make it better not just different""."
5,NCAA football 2005 is Beasty,"NCAA football 2005 is a very good game, much better than 2004 which was very good. THe first thing is that you have homefeild advantage. THat pumps up the crowd which then makes the player get nervous and mess up. Then next thing is the match-up stick which is a control to see if theplayer is good or bad and nervous or not nervous. this works for offense or defense and then you can change any player to any other player on the other team. Now when you score a TD you ca celebrate without a penalty by having your fans celebrate with signs. Then the Dynasty goes more in depth Sports Illustrated is better and players may not play because of late curfew or bad grades. Your players also need to be happy or they won't play. Now like Madden 2004 you can create your own playbook. Create-a-school, create-a-player, create-a-stadium has better things for you to use. So now you have to decide if this game is wwhat you want."
3,Disappointed,"There was so much hype for this game, and I was so excited to play it. Many of the issues have already been covered, but here are some of mine:The good:The crowd is more responsive to what is going on, booing when the team 'stinks it up' with a '3 and out'. I also like the create a sign option and the close up of the individual fans.The bad:The bugs are my biggest problem: 1)opening music to any TV game hitches 2) coach is wearing a jacket when temperature is in the 90's 3) stupid announcer can't stop talking about the fans 'not rocking anymore' when a blow-out is occuring in a championship or bowl game (this literally happens before EVERY play).Also, the recruiting changes didn't seem to add any value, the discipline mode seems like an afterthought (great idea, just poorly rendered) and the graphics overall just don't seem to have improved.The 2005 game has a lot of new gadgets, but the gameplay hasn't really improved from 2004."
4,"Still the most fun sports game, but....",I really wish they would fix the AI. Varsity is too easy and sometimes All-American is too hard if you play with a middle of the road team like I do (Bowling Green). Why can't the computer run the ball? Why do my receivers who are some of the best in the game magically drop the ball on All-American and not on Varsity. OK I had my rant.I do really like this game and the new features. I think last years recruiting was better because i had no idea how many points i need to score a recruit. A very fun game to play overall.Go Falcons!
5,the next generation of college football,"WOW!!! This is the most excellent college football game i personally have ever played. The graphics, gameplay, crowd, and and adreniline level is all at its peak. There is no flaw i can think of in this game. I've only had it for 2 days and ive been playing it 24/7 im so hooked to it. If your a big college football fan like me go out and buy this game you will love it!"
5,On Top,Ea Sports has definately won the national championship of football games. My first night I bought it I pulled an all nighter playing right up to where I had to get ready for work. All the new add ins are awesome. This is definately a must have! Go Penn State!
4,This Game is going to be the best,Ausome the 2005 addition of Ncaa Football is going to be the best game ever. It will let you switch player positions in the middle of a dynasty if a player is not doing to good at his position. You can also make big hits to make them fumble but normaly they won't get injured. Get this Home field advantage is going to be sick. They tell you what the hardest place to play at is. If your players get tired of your school of playing time or not seeing the ball that much thay will transfer to another to another school or players can transfer to your school. There is going to be 28 more bowl teams and 49 rivalry trophies. You can even create your own fan. This game is going to ROCK and you should buy it if you like football games. I sure Know I am. YEAAAAAAAH! it is worth 5 stars to rate already
4,Totally different from 2004,The first thing I noticed about 2005 was that the visuals are a whole lot better than 2004. The players and stadiums just catch your eye first thing. The gameplay is a lot different if you ask me (and if you are reading this you did). The thing I didn;t like was that a lot of times the guy I was playing would throw a deep pass into TRIPLE coverage and come away with the ball. This happened way too many times. Running the ball is a definate challenge. there are a lot more user plays. Last year was only user pick but this year there are user tackle for losses and alot more that I can't think of right now. I haven't started the dynasty mode yet but I can't wait. Overall it's still a great game and a different experience altogether than 2004.
3,"ok, I guess",Three major features hit you when you play NCAA Football 20051) New Home Field Advantage2) Matchup Stick3) New Create a Sign FeatureBut lets face it the actual game is practically the same as NCAA 2004. There is no difference in the players face textures and there is no differnce in the wide receivers ability to catch the ball. One game I threw it to a wide open Mike Williams and what does he do? Drops it!!!! Also when players celebrate they go right through one another( whats up with that)Overall the game didnt drop down from 2004 but it didnt go much higher eitherTake my advice and rent the game first and see if you like it!!
4,Better than 2004!!!!,"I actually rate this 4 and a half stars. I was going to rent this game before buying it, but I decided just to buy it. I'm glad I did! This game is definetly better than 2004! The graphics are a little bit better, the gameplay is awesome, the new features are cool, and finally, the crowd doesn't cheer constantly. I love it!Pros:- better graphics- dynasty mode is more in-depth- the crowd sounds more realistic- homefield advantage, baby!- big hit is awesome- the rosters are bigger- create-a-sign is cool- the player, crowd, and mascot celebrations- the match-up stick is helpful sometimesCons- in dynasty mode, players get in trouble too often- the more agile running system can mess you up- sometimes, the crowd gets too loud when the home offense comes outWell, to sum it up, this game is great! I think that college football fans should buy this game, and people who just like football. Trust me, this game is better than the 2004 version."
1,needs some improvements,"there is one thing it must have in 2005 if I'm going to buy it.In Dynasty mode, when you create your schedule at the beginning of the year, you must play X number of games in your conference, and you can't change them. In 2003, Michigan did not play Penn State or Wisconsin. So, even if I play 20 years of Dystany football with Michigan, I can NEVER play against PSU or WI.I would also like to see being able to switch players' positions. If I have 8 guards rated at 99, and 2 centers at 50, I can't cut the centers and have one of the guards move over.And it would be cool to see Michigan run out of the tunnel, hitting the GO BLUE banner on the way out.New audio clips really needed to be added. I've played a lot of hours on 2004, and I'm really sick of hearing the same comments over and over and over again.Let's hope 2005 improve these areas, and I'll be happy!"
4,Little Known Gem,"As innovative as the Byrds and with twice the talent of the Eagles, Poco remains one of rock's most underrated groups. Crazy Eyes is not as simple and sunny as some of their earlier classic country-rock albums, but the patient listener will be rewarded. Close your eyes and let Brass Buttons and Magnolia take you to deep bittersweet places in your heart. Timothy B Schmidt's voice is as smooth as ever on Here We Go Again, and Richie Furey shows again why he deserved to play along side Stills and Young in Buffalo Springfield. This album is impossible to categorize and is not for everyone but i'm still appreciating it after 25 yrs."
4,Remaster Poco Please,This is a very good disc. Why it wasn't remastered and treated with the respect it deserves I don't know. Why Furay left after this disc I'll never understand. I love many of the post Furay discs but I can't help but feel greatness lost.
4,Pretty Good Album,"I have seen a lot of less than favourable reviews about this one, but I really like it. Highlights for me are the title track (simply love that banjo), magnolia and blue water."
5,Crazy Eyes,"Just wanted to add: from what I understand, ""Crazy Eyes"" was never performed live in concert, due to its complexity for the time. Has anyone heard differently?"
3,From radio commercial to #1 on the charts.,"C.W. McCall is a ficticious person dreamed up and acted out by Chip Davis (who IS Mannheim Steamroller) when he was writing jingles in the early '70s. After the success of the McCall character in a commercial, he decided to give the folks what they wanted and became this alter-ego while still composing the brilliant ""Fresh Aire"" series for MS. Kinda funny to see some of the reviewers' comments about McCall's upbringing and the fact that he ""means what he is singing"". Nonetheless, it's an entertaining foray into the world of truck driving songs. But I think Red Sovine and Dave Dudley have more to offer."
3,C.W. McCall & Mannheim Steamroller,The creative genius behind the music of C.W. McCall was Chip Davis who went on to form the group known as Mannheim Steamroller.
5,CW Mccall,"I have really enjoyed listening to this cd. It reminds me of my days as a kid. My dad listened to him all of the time it seems. Also, a lot of the places he sings about is close to where I live. The only song I'm missing is Roy. Where can I find it? Any ideas?"
4,Classic Hits for Those of Us Who Remember the 70s,"Breaker breaker good buddy...I generally do not enjoy country music. However, in 1980 (or so) my brother made me a tape with this album on one side and the Beach Boys Endless Summer on the other. I loved it! I listened to it ALL the time. From Washington to Minnesota and back. All summer. ALL the time. Then it wore out. Imagine how excited I am that I once again get to lose myself in these classics of the CB era.The songs are great and the lyrics are pretty satirical and funny. Some of them are just really pretty songs.I recommend it to anyone who enjoys country, or is looking for a blast from the past."
4,Great shape,This CD came quickly and was in very great shape. I would definitely buy from this person again. I would recommend to anyone.
3,"Great, but the first was the best","Sure, the songs don't age well, but they were never meant to. This is a period piece and should be appreciated as such. It's beautiful '70s country orchestra craftsmanship and great spoken-word lyrics with awesome comic timing. Extra points for songs that were so prescient about environmentalism and the disappearance of open space, like ""There Won't Be No Country Music"", though WOLF CREEK PASS's ""Old 30"" and ""Glenwood Canyon"" hit that note even better -- just part of the reason it's such a shame that album's out of print/unavailable on CD. I grew up on WCP and still have it on tape. It's his first album and for my money it's still the best -- stark & evocative, far less slick & repetitive than a lot of these post-Convoy songs, which get bogged down fast in novelty riffs & overproduction."
3,Sounds Like Johnny Cash Meets The Dillards!,"C. W. Macall will always be known as the artist who sang Convoy, from the film soundtrack.It evokes the explosion of CB radio in the US and UK too. The song itself is a fun parody of all truck drivers with scrapes with the law etc.Not too much else was known to me prior to buying this CD and to be honest, it's a mixed bag.I like Wolf Creek Pass, Fout Wheel Drive and Black Bear Road, there very much in the Convoy mode.I/m not so keen on Crispy Critters and especially the overly sentimental Roses For Mama.All in all perhaps C. W. Macall's music has'nt passed the test of time, but it certainly was fun while it lasted.PS The Convoy soundtrack, I'd love to get that on CD!"
4,CW McCall,Had this album when I was younger. Still knew the words. Enjoyed this a lot while going down the road.
4,A Must Hear Song,"""Hello World,"" is a really great song. The first time I heard it, I was totally into it. I urge everyone to listen to it. Her lyrics are awesome and the video is slammin'"
5,Hello Ms. Perez!,"Best time to listen to this song? - Monday Morning. You know, when you have the hardest time getting up facing the coming week (good wake up song). As someone mentioned, her style is alot like B-Witched, uptempo, bubbly, semi pop. It would be interesting to hear a dance/club version of this song.If you get the single and doen't like it, use it as a Christmas gift. Just remember, ""Life is easy if you wear a smile"" :)"
4,great,"this was a great story! and according to the back of the book, is the story 'the anklet' from the arabian nights. i thought it was very well told. i didn't really like the pictures though. they kind of look like figures posing instead of characters in the story, and there are noticable outlines around the people so as to make you think they're cut outs, or are not a part of the scenery they're presented in. the over posy-ness and the not fitting into the background kind of reminds me of cheesy picture books i read from the 80's. now these pictures aren't as bad as those, but the way they are presented are reminiscent of that... style. for this reason i didn't give it a 5, but i still like the book and think it's worth reading as the storytelling was well done."
5,A Real Basketball Embassador,"Knowing Pat for over a decade and having spent three of those years coaching against him in the Middle East. I am not suprised to see such a well written book. This book exemplifies the committment to detail which keeps the reader locked in right down to the final ticks much like Pat's teams that he has coached. A must read not only for coaches but for anyone who has an interest in cultures. The chain of events are unbelievably funny and reads like an ficticious adventure novel, but guess what it's real. The greatest source of knowledge is derived through travel and Pat has a wealth of it."
1,Not Well Written,"You can tell by the way it is written that Pat Stewart thinks he is very funny. Unfortunately, he is not! The book drags along to the point that it very hard to read. In fact, I could not finish it. Reading it felt like watching a bad comedian bombing on stage - you just want it to end. In the hands of a better writer this may well have been a good book. The subject matter had potential. Travelling abroad is ripe for comic attack as, I am sure, is putting together a basketball team in Saudi Arabi. It's too bad that the writer couldn't make any of the humor flow. He was constantly throwing in one-liners of his own trying to add humor. The most poorly written book I have read in the four years I have been buying [...]"
4,Wonderfully Written- Help shape my life,"I recieved this Bible from my mom, after she had to out bid a man who also wanted one for his daughter. I appriciate that she was the winner. It has changed my life, when I am feeling depressed the SHORT MINI-Devos are wonderful to find and have a wonderful way of speaking to me. I was losing hope, not knowing what to say or pray for, and after reading one of the devos and the passage along with it. It spoke to me like no other devotional bible has. It told me that God knows what were trying to say even if we can't find the words for it. And thats only 1 of the 100's of devotions in the True Images Bible."
1,Wrong topics for a BIBLE,"I'm disturbed that the commentary subjects (oral sex, lesbianism, etc.) share a cover with the word of God! Yes, these subjects need to be discussed in this world, but such topics need to be mom-to-daughter or dad-to-daughter conversations, not private ""devotions.""I am very concerned that people will purchase this ""Bible"" for their daughter, their neice, their neighbor or friend not knowing that under the attractive cover such adult topics are discussed. Can you imagine giving this Bible to a ""tween"" girl and have her come to you asking, ""what is oral sex?"" She'll find out soon enough, let's not introduce it through a ""Bible.""Yes, young ladies need Bibles written for them, but the topics in the commentaries or devotions shouldn't introduce them to innocence-wrecking terms that they are not yet ready for.Skip this Bible and choose one of the many wholesome Bibles written for this age group."
3,at least I got my money back,"Never got the book, and had to repeatedly remind my 11 y.o. daughter that it's coming... AMazon said it would take about 2 weeks, then shipper said it would take upwards of 21 ""business days"" to get here from one state over. Item was apparently lost in the mail, and when I finally got fed-up and emailed seller again, they promptly returned my $, but I'm not sure what a deal online purchasing for books is if you have to pay for 2-day shipping to actually receive it. Maybe I'm impatient, but no one should wait 5 weeks for a book!"
3,Daewoo DSC3470N Digital TV,"Like the tv. However, after about a month the color started to fuzz when things moved on the screen. Also a green discoloration formed on the edges.Contacted an authorized service center. They and I have been calling Daewoo technical support for the last two months trying to get some kind of information to fix the TV. Daewoo does not seem to support its product or to return calls to its service centers or its customers. If you believe that customer support as a part of what you pay for (especially for something that costs $$$) then you want to buy Sony, Toshiba, anything but Daewoo."
5,Awsome,"This is the best TV I have ever owned, I don't know how I was able to live without HD TV. I would definetly buy from Daewoo again. I will never buy a non HD set again. I did my homework before the purchase and this was the best deal I could find on a set this large with an HD tuner in it."
1,Daewoo is BAD,"It was a wonderful set.Great price, great picture. Amazon delivered hassle free.I was very happy until....the warranty expired and the so did the TV.It cost me 126.00 dollars to find that the picture tube was shot.I called Daewoo, and called Daewoo.The strange thing is that in the whole U.S.there is only one guy to speak with. His name is Alex.After several weeks of run arounds he finally agreed to have the tube replaced.The repair shop estimated the cost would be 1,200.dollars.Alex then called and said he will not cover that or anything.I haven't received a return call from him since.Totally disgusted I turned to Amazon.They easily communicated with me.Once we had a clear understanding of the situation they agreed to give me a full refund including the shipping charge to have it sent back.....What a relief.Thanks Amazon and shame on you Daewoo."
1,Huh?,"I have ADD and thought I could use this ""workbook"" to help me in my daily life without having to go to a psychologist or specialist in ADD. Unfortunately, I have ADD. I am saying this because I can't focus long enough to make this workbook work for me. Read all this and then do this exercise that I am suppose to remember. This book is so un-ADD it's not even funny. As an adult who has dealt with ADD my entire life, I cannot read several pages and then do some exercises. It just doesn't work. While I did see myself in several of the examples, I just couldn't complete the exercises."
4,Good for defining the problem,"Very distinct in information. I think some of the workbook is unrealistic in terms of how one can quickly decide to overcome a long standing psychological problem w/ one short and not very specific ""survey."""
1,Catch-22,1. I can't finish the projects I start because I have ADD.2. I realize I can't go on like this.3. I make reading this book and finishing the exercises my new project.4. goto 1.Don't waste your money see a doctor.
1,HORRIBLE!,"Simply put: horrible digitized version. There are no page separation, no chapters, lots of random symbols/characters (^+<&)in middle of words, lack of coherecne between sentences (I guess whole sentences are missing) and the on top of that, you get a stupid ""digitized by VjOOQIC"" message on every page (I would rather call them screens, as they're not proper pages)Bottomline: don't waste your time nor money."
5,www.mightypharoahe.com,"This album is an instant classic, it surpasses a majority of the albums released to this day. The creativity by Pharoahe Monch is just amazing, his flow beats down any mc, lyrically he is the strongest out right now. Its out of print but track it down it should be in every hip-hop's head collection. This isnt some of Pharoahe's best work, but this is one of the freshest albums out, its more like the darker side of illmatic with more creativity. Pharoahe Monch has incredible wordplays, similes, and metaphors."
5,Pretty darn good,"In International affairs we get the next brillant work to come out of Rawkus Records. While not as good as Mos Def's album (you may disagree) its still an amazing album. It might take you a couple of listens to really appriciate it (Monche is alot more abrasive than Mos Def) but once you pick up where he's going with the album, you'll love it. The track the truth, with Common and Talib Kweli might be the best..."
5,Must have cd!,"Pharoahe mixes together comercial stuff (tracks 8, 9 & 10) with real underground that features many of the best rappers today and thats all good. One of the best song on this cd, ""The Truth""! produced by Dimond D (the best producer :)) u just get goosbumps when u listen to it. Common and Kweli are so tight and offcours Pharoahe is the best! Pharoahe is good producer too as he showes in ""God Send""& ""Behind closed doors"" and ""simon says"" is kinda coo' 2...This cd is deffenatly MUST HAVE CD if you are a true hip-hop head!"
3,Simon Says,"If you have never heard of Pharoahe Monch's beat of ""Simon Says"", you will hear it in a Scene from Charle's Angels (Drew, Cameron & Lucy Version) where they are about to fight Sam Rockwell & his evil crew. You will also hear this in an episode of Daria. I only bought Internal Affairs to get to Simon Says. If you are a fan of Pharoahe Monche, you will know his music very well & share it among others."
3,disapointing,"sorry guys - i was desapointed from monch's cd. i don't know, maby my expectations were too high after hearing his wonderfull tracks in soundbombing and with the high and mighty - but this cd rarely climbs to those kind of peaks. of course, the lyrics are still sharp and wise, but the music is not as rich as his fellow mc's mos def, talib and common. sorry monch, but i'm still waiting to the masterpiece that you have in your power to pruduce."
5,Lyricist of the Year,"I had never heard of Pharoahe Monch before I saw the video for ""Simon Says"". At first, I didn't think too much of this song because I wasn't really into the beat. However, once I listened to the lyrics, I realized that this guy had mad flow. I decided to go out on a limb and buy the album and was not disappointed. Pharoahe flows like crazy on almost every song. He is one of the best lyricists that I've heard in a long time. Plus there are a lot of good beats on this album. I got to the point where I liked the beat for ""Simon Says"", but there are a lot of better beats. Some of my favorite songs include ""Queens"" and ""The Truth"", which features the lyrical talents of Common and Talib Kweli. These songs in particular as well as some others create a very chillin atmosphere, which I have always been fond of in hip-hop. Pharoahe definitely gets the award for best new artist and in fact, this was one of the best albums of the year in my opinion."
5,Rawkus keeps releasing gems,"GET THIS ALBUM! A week after Mos Def:Black On Both Sides (which is also a must buy) was released, Rawkus brings us another great album. Pharaohe Monch is one of the best MC's right now and he shows it on this album. And this album has great production (much of it by Pharaohe himself) and excellent guest appearances. This is a must buy."
4,Everything! but length,"Hmm I got this album quite late I see. Reading the comment here that convinced me to buy this album says Monch has peerless lyrical ability. Well of course I had to compare this to all the rage right now, Eminem. I've found this album proves Monch has everything Eminem has, plus MUSIC (as compared to a single guitar pluck that has it's pitched change a few times to make a song) and sanity. Indeed, Monch has near-peerless lyrical ability best demonstrated on the (unfortunately short) raw track, Rape. Ingenious, vulgar metaphors =)Every track has way-above-average lyrics, but my favorites are the ones with the music that goes over the top: Behind Closed Doors, Queens, No Mercy, The Light, and The Truth. The CD ends with the excellent remixed addition to a classic, Simon Says, weighing in at about 6 minutes.The only fault I can find with this CD is that there isn't enough of it; it's about 54 minutes. As far as I can tell, this was the best album of 1999..."
4,Elaborate Approach,"This book was informative and helpful in understanding the assistance required for people with substance abuse issues. It recommends that a fairly elaborate and well organized plan be orchestrated before scheduling the intervention. The person that originated my investigation into planning an intervention used this book as a guide but did not have the people for a complex intervention. It is a good book to read before instigating the intrusion, to help thoroughly think through all aspects before confronting the person that will be forever impacted. It is a very good guide for anyone living with an impaired person that needs to make a drastic change to save lives."
4,Easy read,"Read this book really quickly prior to a family intervention. Easy read, gives the reader a basic understanding of chemical dependency and how to intervene."
4,A Classic Text,...the disease model is settled science. The American Medical Association has recognized alcoholism as a disease since the 1950s and long-term research of high validity supports the fact that addiciton is a disease...I do hope potential readers of this classic text will not be dissuaded by an unknown source's unfounded personal beliefs.
4,Not Detailed Enough,"This gives a good overview of alcoholism and the general technique of intervention. The author makes it quite clear that families can intervene on an alcoholic without using a professional in many cases. This is important for families who do not have the money to hire a professional. But I found that the book does not give a great deal of detailed instruction on how to carry out an intervention. I think, after having done a intervention on someone in my husband's family, the book oversimplifies the whole process. There are many issues that cropped up for us that the book did not cover. While this book is worth reading, it is not the best I've read when it comes to giving practical, detailed advice on actually doing the intervention."
3,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good. But when I went shopping for a professional interventionist, every one I interviewed suggested that I read the book ""Love First."" I've read both, but Love First really lays out the whole process in detail and takes you through it step by step. And yes, the intervention was successful. Thank God!"
5,Spellbinding.,"I learned of Peter Buffet when I saw Spirit, a Journey through Drums Dance and Song on PBS. Since then I have become a great fan of his. 500 Nations is a moving, soulful piece of work with songs that reach out and tug at your heartstrings. It has some wonderful artists on it and Chief Hawk Pope's vocals are the epitome of the Native American Voice. No doubt about this one folks...buy it!"
4,Wonderful,"I have not had any problems with any of my purchases from Amazon so far. At this point, I think it would be fair to say that Amazon has a standard of business that should be followed by many for success. Very professional and continued interest in making the customer pleased.Thank you Amazon for asking.Happy New Year.The Kat"
4,Just A Debut But A Look Of Great Things To Come!,"I remember Kevin Aviance when he used to perform at a local club by the name of ""Escuelita's"" in New York City. He is quite a performer/entertainer. He definately has stage presence and knows how to get your attention! But anyway back to his album. If you're a house music fan like I am, than this is a must have to your collection. Kevin first got our attention with ""Din Da Da"" Now he wants us to know that rhythm is his! This CD will make you dance your ass off! I wish Kevin a successful career and hope he can put out even better stuff in the future."
3,disappointed,"Somehow the fact that this was on Wave got me enthused about the album but years down the track this is something I never listen too. Great album artwork,some interesting beats and good production values but like Klaus Nomi this guys voice is only any good in small doses. Approach with caution."
1,"Bad product, bad warranty","I bought this drive in February of this year and within 60 days, it was whirring and running slowly. Now it's messing up daily in one way or another.Seagate's ""five year warranty"" means they'll replace your drive with a refurbished drive, and I figure if a new one was no good, a refurbished one won't be any better. They suggested I return it to the store to see if maybe the store would replace it with a new one (which they wouldn't). I have no choice but to replace my brand new hard drive with a refurbished one."
1,This will stain your furniture.,"Like the other buyer, this cover stained my expensive ottoman and sofa. If you care about the furniture you are covering, I would think twice buying this item."
4,average cook,Product seems to provide a fool proof method for sharpening knives and they are sharp after you use this product. It has to stick around for a couple of years to get a 5th star.
2,Made me too nervous to finish with,"I purchased this but returned it nearly immediately in trade for a larger electric model by the same brand. Why? Because it was very difficult to begin to sharpen my knives on this unit, the first dozen or so passes on the rough side had the knife grabbing and sticking, and the effect of all this stop & go behavior was a very uneven beginning.It's possible that had I proceeded I could have evened out the damage and all could have been fine; but everything I was seeing and feeling was telling me that this sharpener was ruining a good knife.The shape of the edge of your knives will likely determine your experience with this sharpener. I feel that this was trying to do more reshaping to my edges than what it is intended for, so it didn't perform."
2,"nice product, doesnt sharpen very well","it seems to be well constructed, but I am not impressed at all with its sharpening capabilities. It really didn't make any of my knives very sharp, and just doesn't seem like it does anything. Those who have a stone and can't seem to get it at the right angle or make it work right and decide to try and use a manual sharpener instead (like me) will be very disapointed. I think this occurs for all sharpeners anyways, but I would recommend buying a stone kit with an angle guide instead of this piece"
2,this diamond doesn't shine,"Chefs Choice 440 2 stage sharpenerDoesn't really live up to the billing. I have been working with 4 new Chicago Cutlery knives and am disappointed in the edge that this machine provides. Also,you really have to make a concerted effort to get any kind of edge on the front curved part of the knife. In the past I have used ceramic rods and achieved a much sharper edge than with the 440. Will give this diamond stone unit more time and work but at this point,thumbs down."
2,Great - While it lasts..!,"We followed the instructions, keeping the blade aligned to the wheels. It's very safe and very stable. The tip of the knife is always sharper than the end of the knife no matter how far back you start your sharpening. The product sharpens very well the first couple of times (cutting paper like nothing), then the diamonds start to wear away, and you can never get it to sharpen as well as it did those first couple of times. We've used it about one every week or two for about one year, and now it does next to nothing to our knives no matter how many times we run it through. It doesn't seem to last very long.... It's time to invest in a new sharpener for our kitchen - and it's not going to be this one..!!"
3,Not a great sharpener,"This product does sharpen knives, but quite slowly and not too effectively, based on how often you must re-sharpen. I am not a fan of diamond dust sharpeners like this, because they are not very effective in sharpening dull blades to a satisfactory level in a reasonable amount of time. These are truly a compromise in effort and effectiveness."
2,about as sharp as my brain,"I'm not sure what the high rating is about. I have had this for a couple of years and tried stubbornly to sharpen. It marginally works at best. There is no angle guidance other than manually keeping the tilt against the wheels, so it is very easy to lose the tilt and wobble unsafely. Even after careful use, now the stage 1 abrasives seem to have completely deteriorated that I cannot get any sharpening improvement. Could never get the sharpness I need from this."
5,Great product,"Unbeatable for the price. Easy to use. Doesn't give true razor edge results, but close to it."
2,Great Idea - needs more follow through,"I thought this would be great for my kids 7 & 9 who are studying the Vikings. It looks awesome. They couldn't wait to open it and see what was inside. The ideas are great but the actual activities are lacking. The Viking boat is very difficult to get together, the instructions are vague and you need strong quick-setting glue to be able to glue and then bow the pieces. The mast is a piece of cardboard you need to roll up. How exactly do you roll cardboard? The game is neat - the little pieces are nicely detailed. The board is a folded piece of paper (maybe this is where they should have used the cardboard) and the istuctions are to simplistic to follow (we added our own). It also includes a small paperback book, a map of explorations and a paper on Norse myths which are all nice. With all the work that went into the design of the beautiful treasure chest with drawer and lock&key, I'm dissapointed the activities weren't as well designed."
2,Where's the pictures?,"I am inclined to think favorably of any book that comes out from Chronicle Books. They publish very good quality books. Their craft books are often first rate.I bought this book through the mail, but was very dismayed to find that it has very few pictures of the crafts and activities. Consequently, it is not very enticing. I put it in a box and didn't think about it for months until I just unpacked it today.Some of the activities seem awfully bland and unoriginal. Make and play with a paddle and ball? Make wet footprints on the sidewalk? Ideas like this for almost 20 bucks? This is not up to Chronicle's usual standards. There are some very fine books out there that suggest great activities for kids, but this isn't one of them."
2,Problematic from day one,"This is a terrible DVD player. My sister-in-law and I both received one for Christmas, and neither of ours work properly. Hers simply failed to work, and then her replacement stopped working after two months. Mine works, but apparently overheats. After about a half hour of use, the movies drag and/or skip and are virtually unwatchable. If you can spend a few extra bucks to get a better system, do so. It will save you a world of frustration."
1,Thankfully it was a Christmas present,"I received the unit for Christmas in December of 2001. During the time I used it (approximately 40-50) total hours I was pleased. It had lots of features and was relatively inexpensive. After twelve months, however, the unit has stopped working. There has been no abuse, power surges, etc. It just plain quit. Considering the relatively small amount of use this unit endured, this is totally unacceptable to me. I would NOT recommend this unit due to the poor quality and reliability."
2,DVD Player,"I recently purchased this DVD Player because everyone in the neighborhood said it was ""the one to get"" I beg to differ. The picture is great, but the sound is very low, and everytime you stop, pause or skip a constant subtitle starts running, and you have to keep pushing buttons to shut it off, very big inconvienence. Other thern that, it is a very slick looking machine, but I'm still not to sure about the quality."
4,Unusual and Compelling,"A synoptic capsule of ""Their Yesterdays"" does not sound terribly enticing. The novel has no named central characters; the two protagonists are defined only as ""the man"" and the woman."" The action is not chronological. The entire book is a series of flashbacks with each chapter devoted to a broad, theoretical topic like temptation, religion, success, failure, etc. There is very little dialogue and the exact whereabouts of the plot is never revealed. Still under the mastery of Harold Bell Wright, it works! The author of ""Shepherd of the Hills"" is able somehow to make the abstract diagram a satisfying, rewarding novel that rivals his other works. Why he ever attempted such a non-conventional approach is hard to imagine, but lovers of great literature are awfully glad that he did."
5,Best Little Bargain VCR,"I am SO impressed with this little sleeper VCR. It does what it's supposed to do and does it well. Its visual and sound integrity are well beyond what I expected for the dollar (and the dollar is a well-kept secret). If you're on a budget but want good quality equipment, this is definitely something you should check out."
2,Out On A Limb...,"I just tried to listen to the LP again- never have gotten thru it- sounds too amateurish. During the first song the vocal mike isn't turned on for one of the singers (Alan?)& the other vocals are distorted (drives me crazy). The other songs are sound like demoes (except for Apricot Brandy, which is great). I'm going out on a limb and promoting the 3rd LP ""Better Times Are Coming""- much better sound, better singers, great instrumentals, but kinda dated (1970) songs ""It's A Groovy World"" & ""Let's Party"", etc. The 3rd LP is one I go back to..."
4,"The ""Supergroup"" who should have been right up there!","Although this and the 2 follow up albums did next to nothing in their day - they deserved much much more.This was a hugely underrated band who somehow mixed hammond keyboards with a Motownish feel, guitar licks the envy of many an axe-man and rhythms to pump you along. All my vinyl copies died years ago so to find the 3 CD's was a real surprise. If you like the 60's, but psychedelia wasn't quite your thing, if you like heavy but not too heavy, if you like Motown, but not the Jackson's ... this could be for you. The self titled debut is the best of the 3 albums, so start with this one."
5,the Legend on CD! File under answered prayers,"Go to 'primo' fansite for intro and happy reminiscencesrhinoceros-group.com--it's a perfect (debut) album, a connoisseur's funkyrock ballsy psychsupergroup--all elements gel in a superior Paul Rothchild production --he could be known for overly-anally-rehearsing/producing, ie Doors esp. after albums 1/2...there's even an alleged rawer killer Rhino. 1st album somewhere, shades of Butterfield, anybody? :)--Gimme a 'B'Gimme an ' I 'Gimme an 'L'Gimme another 'L'Gimme a 'Y'...nowGimme an M-U-N-D-I!Whazzat spell?!BILLY MUNDI * BILLY MUNDI * BILLY MUNDI * BILLY MUNDI * BILLY MUNDIOur favourite drummer ever! see also Zappa/Mothers albums 2/3/UncleMeat ('King Kong')"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I've always loved Hamlisch and hated Sayger Faker Baker, my GOD what a horrible dated, terrible lyrics and rotten scoring. I feel like taking a shower now that I've listened to it. Not 1 memorable song, and it's amazing that Chorus Line which is 5 years before, is as fresh, brilliant and innovative as ever, and this piece of garbage started OUT dated."
5,"""Fallin'"" for this cast album isn't very hard to do!","THEY'RE PLAYING OUR SONG is one of the more delighful musicals penned during the 'wilderness years' of the late-70's. It starred Lucie Arnaz and Robert Klein as two unlucky-in-love song writers who end up falling in love with each other.The score, by Carole Bayer Sager with music by Marvin Hamlisch (A CHORUS LINE) bridges the gap between pop and traditional Broadway music, and includes the numbers ""Fallin'"", ""If He Really Knew Me"", ""Right"" and the Title Song.Lucie Arnaz spins gold with all her numbers but is most charming in ""Just For Tonight"" and the 11 o'clock number ""I Still Believe in Love"".This musical played a sell-out Broadway season before being mounted in London as well as in Australia, with the latter production starring Jacki Weaver."
5,So Fun!!,"I saw this on Broadway when I was 18. The music was (and is) lively and fun. I like all the songs, but ""Fallin'"" and ""If He Really Knew Me"" really stand out for me. A few years ago, Lucie came to Minneapolis to perform at a benefit for the HIV Drop-In Center I worked for, and sang all her songs from this show. It brought back the excitement of the show, and she was so nice."
5,Live In New York,"Ever wonder what a Gene Vincent's Bluecaps show must have been like back in the day? Or heck- How about Elvis,Scotty,Bill and DJ ragin' the stage like The Who? Well, what more can I say - The Blue Mooners are bringing their own authentic brand of retro mania into the modern world. And once you've gotten a taste of Nic Roulette's ""September Moon Pie"" croon combined with the ""Joe Maphis on crack"" sonic pickings of Kenny Taylor. Theres no turning back. With such soon to be classics as ""Shoe Leather"" and ""Red on the Line"". This disc proves once and for all that the Blue Moon Boys are the best live Rockabilly band in the USofA!"
2,"It's hard to love a story, when you hate the leading lady.","From the very beginning of this story, I wanted to toss the book aside. I hated the leading female character (Mared) from the get- go. She only got worse as the story unfolded. At one point, she seems to finally come around. Then, she receives a large inheritance and decides she doesn't need the leading man (Payton) any more. She runs off and flirts with every man she meets.Mared is selfish, spoiled, mean- spirited, and ungrateful. She is also lazy and spiteful. Payton, on the other hand, is generous, romantic, thoughtful, patient, and loyal.By the end of the book, I was really wishing he would tell her off. I would have loved to see him get a stronger back- bone and find a woman worthy of his devotion.I gave the book 2 stars, because the writting was vivid and fluid. It was enough to keep me reading to the end."
5,"Funny, wonderful, sexy!","I picked My Scottish Summer up because I'm a push-over for anything Scottish, but I didn't expect it to be so much fun. I always thought Connie Brockway did pretty serious stuff, but her story is hysterical (wait until you read the tee-shirt slogans, and when the heroine tries to look up his kilt...!) Patti Berg is always funny, and she didn't disappoint. I hadn't read the other two authors, but I'll try them now. So few anthologies have all four stories that are good -- this one succeeds."
5,Excellent Music and Recording,"Great selection of Nyman's non-soundtrack music. The CD includes his:-Complete 6-movement String Quartet No. 2-Complete 1-movement String Quartet No. 3-5 Selected movements of the String Quartet No. 4-Two ensemble pieces arranged for the Quartet-Two ensemble pieces arranged by Simon Haram for the Quartet and joined by members of the Michael Nyman BandConsidered a ""minimalist"" (a term that some credit Nyman with coining during his years as a critic), his music is amongst the most interesting of the genre and Nyman's interest and love of the Baroque is especially evident here in String Quartet No. 2 & 3.I also love ""In Re Don Giovanni"", which is Nyman's take on sixteen bars of music from Leporello's aria ""Madamina, il catalogo e questo"" from Don Giovanni.Wonderfully recorded and played. A must have for any Nyman fan and a great introduction to a great Composer for others."
2,teacherman,My Husband's Girlfriend was ok at best. The title of the book instantly grabs you and the plot really disappointed. I feel that the husband should have been more concerned with his wife's feelings and the battle she was fighting. He came across selfish and unconcerned.
2,"Boring, slow, uniteresting story","I can read a book in half a day if it is good. The story did not capture my attention and it took me over a week and a half to finish it. I found myself skipping through it a lot, for the story had no rising action. It states monotone the entire read. I don't recommend this book. I don't think I'll be buying anymore of this author's books, I usually judge the author by the first book I read."
2,What we will do for Love?,The Author had a great concept with this book but She just went the wrong way with it! I really wouldn't waste my time with this book. Thank Godness I borrowed it!!!!!!
2,IT is WHAT it IS,"First, let me say it was a good concept. But, the story itself to me was a little well whack. First, i read the whole book so I'm speaking on the overall book. To me Anya was portrayed to be strong but she put up with a lot of things and it made her look weak. Then, Neil he wanted everything. The only reason he even gave Dani up was because Anya FINALLY put her foot down and was like you can't see her at all. Dani had to come in the house half naked for her to even realize that. Then, the whole time Dani didn't realy hide the fact that she wanted Neil and Anya was like just dealing with it. I don't know maybe because I've never been married I dont' understand. But, it just was too UNBELIEVABLE to me."
3,Too Much,"The book started out ok but it dragged out to long for me. The title caught me attention, but I wished I had borrowed the book instead of buying."
5,The Truth!,"Although many people can't believe that this story would happen, there are some that go through this kind of infidelity and still stay together. Rax paints a picture of love, lust and betrayal in a very honest and humane way. Great read!!!"
4,A Good Read,"I started reading My Husband's Girlfriend on the plane going home for Christmas and finished it just after New Year. It totally kept me coming back and wondering what was happening next. And it totally makes you wonder about how much a person will endure in order to keep love in their home and life.I gotta admit, I think the husband got his cake and got to eat it too. He was a cool and together dude in terms of education and money, but I was so irked with him because he couldn't decide who he wanted... his wife or his mistress. I mean irked me. Anyway... they're characters, not real life so I didn't stay irked for long. lol.Very good read. And perfect for sparking discussion about what you/we will endure/put up with/settle for in our search for Mr. or Miss. Right.fs"
2,Disappointed,I read My daughters boyfriend and was not overly impressed but thought I would give the author another go. This book was equally as boring. Parts were so drawn out...the characters were not jumping off the page. I hope the author stops writing books about people taking other peoples partner.
2,I am so glad I borrowed this book and didn't buy it...,"This book was extremely boring. It started out good and I felt that I should atleast give it a chance. What a waste of my time. The story line was unrealistic and sad. What woman allows herself to be used up again and again? In addition, why would you allow that yo happen? I know that many women would not put up with all that crap!!! I have been married for 20 years and my love doesn't want to cover up the kind of mess depicted in this book. I will not be buying another book from this author."
3,Over The Top,"I liked this book I just thought it was slow and drawn out in most spots. It was also over the top and unrealistic. Anya the wife in this book is definitely ONE OF A KIND. This novel is a mess that just keeps getting worse. I actually got angry at most of the characters. I just couldn't believe nor stand that these people not only keep making the same mistakes over and over but also on the other hand, continuously put up with it. I wish there would have been a better ending as well. It ended rather abruptly. It didn't seem like anything really worked itself out or got solved. . . realistically that is. The characters solve the problems that have been plaguing them this entire novel on one quick page near the very end and live happily ever after. Not fulfilling at all after trudging my way through this entire book."
2,Borrow the book,I was very disappointed in this book. The wife put up with entirely too much crap from the husband. It is just unreal. I would borrow the book instead of buying it.
2,I must be really bored,"This book was really boring. The characters are not really developed. I'm glad that I have enough sense to read the reviews before I purchase a book nowadays. Anya's character really was making me pissed everytime I hear the story in her point of view. Then she goes on to try and give advice to the Dani and Vette, I'm thinking to myself how can you give advice and your situation is out of the ordinary. She's very passive. She not strong-willed in any way. She doesn't get ""tired"" of being used. This book was not realistc in any form. Even though there are situations where peole ""deal"" with certain things, but she never drew the line, it was one thing after the next. This book is really boring. It doesn't get you attention like it should. I'm going to go ahead and finish this book because I'm a avid reader. But I don't think I'll buy any of her books. I'll stick to my regular authors: Eric Jerome Dickey, Carl Webber and others."
4,Not in my house,This book is open for many dicussions I like the way it was written given each character's version of the situation. Neil is not my favorite person I think he did to much for to long his wife should have put her foot down after she found that being civil to the Mistress wasn't working he messed around 1 to many times for me I mean bad enough you made a baby but to keep doing it made me mad but like I said it's open for discussion and I'm sure some people will understand more than others read the book and tell me what you think?
2,Unrealistic,"This book was OK. I was frustrated while reading this book, b/c some of the things his wife put up where just unreal. Too unreal. Borrow it."
3,It was ok,"I agree with the review by Sonya Keeler in that the wife in the book tolerated too much. The book had lots of drama going on, so that held my attention. I wanted to continue reading to find out how much more the wife was going to put up with."
1,My husbands girlfriend,"Depressing, boring and just not worth the money this book was so not good. I was so diappointed."
4,Complex story line,I've read all the reviews on here prior to me writing mine. I think first of all if I were Anya this would have been a really short book! But I think this book will make you open your mind about what marriage should really be about especially if you give it to God. I think this will definitely be a great book for my book club to discuss. I found the book frustrating at times just because I wouldn't have made many of the choices that most of the characters would have made but that's what reading is all about...being able to step out of your comfort zone. Great job for that!TaNisha WebbKC Girlfriends Book Club President
4,makes u stop & think...,"This will definitely be placed on my bookshelf of Top Reads for 2007! Neil & Anya's ""triangle"" made me cringe, laugh, and be pissed off all at the same time! How could a woman accept such actions but she was the initiator??? How could a husband do that to his wife but feel he was honoring her twisted wishes?Anyone in a committed dating relationship or married should consider this as a form of possible ""therapy..."" if you will. Knowing the consequences of not communicating and not realizing the full effects of what can happen when a spouse strays can truly make or break a couple.KUDOS!!!! to you, Cydney for taking a chance and writing about a sensitive subject!!!"
4,What Friendship Means,"This is a delightful musical designed to appeal to children of all ages. (I'm 65 and found it magical!) Although I sure it's better to see the show than just hear it, this cast recording captures the energy of the show quite well. Most importantly, the valuable message of the show comes through very well on this recording. The message of the show is to answer the important question: ""What is friendship?"" Frog and Toad teach us the true meaning of this wonderful word in a way that is fun to hear!!"
5,Too Much Fun,"About a year ago I saw this Play at a local community theater. At first I didn't know what I had gotten myself into, but as it moved along I found myself becoming involved. By the time it was over, I was humming all the tunes and found myself a fan. I then went home to see if I could find a dvd of the stage production, but woefully, one does not exist. So this was the next best thing, and its a great production and cd. The songs are cute, the music catchy, and I, even today, still play it from time to time. Its simple, fun, and I am not afraid to admit I just love it."
5,Dowling College Spring Musical,"I purchased this cd two months before we started casting for the show. It came as a complete surprise that I loved the music- and so enjoyed the fact that ""Cousin Larry"" was in it. For two months I played it in the car everywhere I went. It allowed me to see the play in my mind, and imagine the costumes I would like to see in the production. Once we cast I did have to change a lot of my ideas because the play does not have to be gender specific. I played the cookie song for my five year old niece and she loves it, asks me to put it on whenever she is in the car! Any kid from 2 to 92 would love this music and the cute songs. It inspired me to purchase multiple copies of the book series this was based upon as gifts to my nieces and nephews. I must warn you though, buy a box of cookies to eat while listening!"
4,It is very entertaining!!!,"A kid calls them from Amazona.His grandfather's crafts are being stolen. Then a friend of the boy joins the case.they go investigating to a lot of places, but they don't have a clue.Finally, with the help of the trenchcoat twins, they figure ou the case. Read it!!! it's very good."
1,TERRIBLE BLU RAY TRANSFER FOR TOTAL RECALL/T2 IS OK!,I was really disappointed with the Blu ray transfer of Total Recall. It's just like the first DVD I owned with many areas of grain and uneven pic. T2 is simply ok but could have been much better. If Red Heat and Running man can have good transfers I fail to see why they didn't care about this set. Time to stop ripping off customers. Very sad.
2,Must have been a DVD or VHS transfer to Blu Ray,"If you already have one or both movies on DVD, you do not need to buy this 2-pack on Blu-Ray. Each movies is on its own Blu-ray disc and the back of the box claims it is in 1040p. Maybe it is in 1040p, but high rez of a grainy, dark transfer is not worth looking at. If you like the movies enough to want to own them, avoid this collection."
5,A classic restored to us,"Haven't seen this book since I was a boy myself, but its republication is one of the great events in the publishing world of 1970. Gorey is, of course, well known for his quirky antiquarian drawings and his bizarre sense of black humor, but his work with Peter Neumeyer isn't as familiar as the stories he wrote on his own. Collaboration didn't make Gorey's particular genius any less strange; indeed it sharpened the wit and the eerie conceptualization of these drawings.Little ""Donald"" is rather a creepy boy himself, but he's downright appealing next to his mother, who spends the entire book picking a splinter out of poor Donald's leg with a needle and tweezers, and then seeing to the aftermath of his wound with alcohol and a very large pillow. She will remind you of the part Katharine Hepburn played in LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT.Hooray for Donald, Gorey, Abrams and Neumeyer!"
5,"Quirky Fun for Children, Adults Will Marvel at the Artwork.","This lovely little hardcover was the result of a longstanding correspondence and collaboration between Neumeyer and Gorey.Young Donald is out playing in the woods, when he gets a splinter in the calf of his leg while pushing a tree. Fortunately, his mother is wise in the ways of splinters, and she calls upon her skills to attend to Donald's wound.The text is simple, yet skillfully worded. The illustrations are classic Edward Gorey, especially during a sequence of daydreams that Donald uses to distract himself while his mother sets to work on the splinter.Neumeyer's afterword gives some insight into his friendship and collaboration with the sometimes enigmatic Gorey.This is the kind of quirky, fun book that children will find appealing while their parents marvel at the artwork."
3,OFF TO A GOOD START,"Melissa's 1973 debut album brought this talented singer/songwriter into the spotlight with emotional ballads her forte.HOME TO MYSELF didn't produce any hit singles but foreshadows what lay in her successful future. Her collaboration with Carole Bayer Sager also began here. The songs here are reflective and personal focusing on relationships. Highlights are the poignant title track and the creative reprise of LET IT RIDE. Manchester possesses a strong, emotional voice and had a significant presence in those mellow seventies but the best was yet to come."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this printer a couple of years ago after great reviews. I've been nothing but disappointed with this product. While it prints fantastic photos, and prints text quite quickly, It goes through ink cartridges at lightning speed. The scanner, copier and fax are all cumbersome to use...and the fax never has worked correctly.Now after a couple of years worth of moderate use, this printer has failed to function...and for the cost of getting it serviced...I would rather replace it with a different machine.I am very satisfied with the Canon Cameras I have purchased over the years...but I don't think I will be purchasing another Cannon printer."
5,Great Product,"I've been very happy with this printer, the ink is reasonably priced. But newer models are probably available at lower prices by now."
2,Makana Isn't For Me,Makana's music is not for me; its a little to light and easy going for me. I think he's an excellent guitar player and talented song writer just not my style.
2,UFO Secrets: The Roswell Crash,"Disk 1 and 2 were very similar in content. The second update (2000) contained about 10% new vs. 90% old material. With the exceptions of the eye witness accounts the rest of the material presented was very poor, amateurish and in places downright silly. Some of the parellels drawn on other events were never connected or explained. Like the atomic bombs dropped on Japan to end the war there. A lot of the attempted recreations were also poorly done. The whole set, as a two DVD piece, was a bit overpriced. If interested in this subject, buy something else."
4,Tamed my howling Strat.,"This pickup is amazing, it's a humbucker in a single coil design. As a result, it's like having a noisegate fitted in a guitar. It's a warm sounding pick up with high def tone. Beautiful!"
3,"strainer, ok.","If this strainer had sticky pads on the bottom it would be better. As it is, it collects peels and skins as I wanted it to and keeps the sink cleaner. Dishwasher washable."
3,corner sink strainer,The strainer tends to be unstable (falls over if something heavy like a dish brush is put set in it). It would be better if it were less tall.
5,A visionary.....,"Glenn Phillips simply has to be heard to be believed, and seeing him live is even better. His latest work carries on the Glenn Phillips tradition of pulling dazzling, heart stopping tricks one after another from a magician's hat, not leaving you time to gasp before racing on to the next incredible riff.Phillips always works creatively with a group of excellent musicians, and they again provide a razor's edge, taut backing for the guitar explorations.Phillips can do things on, with, and to a guitar you would not think musically possible.If you're looking for ""Toad the Wet Sprocket"" you won't find them here, just one of the most original and creative musician's performing today...."
1,Very Disappointed,"I couldn't even get through the entire CD once. I guess it is possible that this is brilliant song writing, chord selection, and note phrasing, but one thing for sure, it is not pleasing to listen to. Many songs have numerous layering of guitar, and they don't sound good together. I don't even know how to classify this music. It is instrumental rock, but it is an experiment that really went awry. The sad part....I'm a huge Toad the Wet Sprocket fan. One has nothing to do with the other. Toad fans, stay away! Folks who like wierd instrumental background sound, go for it!"
1,Don't Get Misled!!,"On the surface this would appear to be a nice compilation of key Chuck Berry hits. WRONG! It is a collection of his hits, re-recorded by Berry in 1967. Why is beyond me. If you are a Chuck Berry oficionado (sp?) then you would probably find this interesting -- alternative covers of his own songs. But if you're looking for a compilation of the originals, this isn't it. Really makes me angry that it does not say this anywhere on the cover."
1,Don't buy this!,I bought this with no idea that these were re-recordings. Why was this ever recorded and produced?
1,Skip this particular CD,CD has all the great songs of Chuck Berry but they just don't sound right. Pick another CD. Stay away from this one.
2,"Relatively fun, but horrible lockup/crash problems....","Not the most complex PC game I've played, but I found what I was able to experience relatively fun for a fairly straightforward arcade-style starfighter game.Unfortunately, the game always crashes to my PC's desktop after 5-15 minutes without warning, and LucasArts' tech support has been a repeatedly frustrating exercise in futility. *All* possible problems via my (relatively high-end) system or a bad CD printing have been eliminated, and it looks like all the bugs simply weren't worked out before release. This wouldn't be the first time I've had such a problem with LucasArts games when they first come out.Not a bad game, but if you're looking at it, I'd recommend waiting for patches to come out and the price to drop some more. Otherwise, you're taking your chances with compatibility, etc.(Oh! Also, you definitely need a joystick or gamepad to play. Use a keyboard/mouse only, and you can't last 10 seconds.)"
3,"Somewhat disappointing, but worth the money.","This game has nothing on the original ""X-Wing"" trilogy. A good flyer can complete the entire set of missions in less than two hours. But the graphics are great and so are the flight environments. Not only do you fly in space, but there are atmospheric missions as well. And you face dozens of enemies, whereas the original Star Wars starfighter games only gave you a few things to shoot at at a time. It's kind of cool to be absolutely overwhelmed by fire from enemy fighters, ground troops and even boats. The story is a little cheesy, but the game is very entertaining and challenging at the higher levels. Very re-playable. I still miss ""X-Wing"", though."
1,unsatisfied,"here is a game that had potential , but dont waste your money. The controls are horrible and unresponsive and the training levels seem to last forever. Not much pay-off in thisgame for all the patience it requires. Do yourself a favor and get jedi knight 2 jedi outcast."
2,boring....,"i don't buy may games, just ones dealing with star wars. i know it says star wars on the the box, but i felt like i was playing any generic space-based video game.don't get this if you want a star wars experience."
5,delicious,"A delicious change from theBar Harbor All Natural Smoked Wild Kippers, 6.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)and theBar Harbor All Natural Smoked Herring with Cracked Pepper, 6.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12). TheBar Harbor Wild Herring Fillets In Tomato-Basil Sauce, 6.7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)recipe is just right, with Tomato and herbs, the flavor of the Smoked Herring prevails and the Tomato is not over powering (more like a flavored sauce on top)."
3,SODIUM CONTENT IS ABOVE AVERAGE= NOT GOOD,"SODIUM / SALT CONTENT IS CRITICAL ; IT USED TO BE THAT NOBODY NOTICED OR EVEN ""CARED"" ; BUT !!!! THIS IS THE 21ST. CENTURY & KNOWLEGE IS ""POWER"" ""LIKE NEVER BEFORE IN HISTORY"" ; THE SODIUM/SALT CONTENT OF THIS PRODUCT IS : ""WAY TOO MUCH"" & IS ""UNNECCSSARY"" ; EXcessive SALT/SODIUM ONLY MEANS ""NEGATIVE"" EFFECT ON THE HUMAN BODY ; LOOK AROUND , ALMOST EVERTHING YOU BUY(FOOD) ITEMS HAS ""SALT/SODUIM"" ADDED= EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS , WHEN ALL ADDED TOGETHER = ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL ALIMENTS(HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE<HARDING OF THE ARTERIES) , ETC> = DANGER TO YOUR HEALTH & PREMATURE AGEING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I don't know,"this book needs more detail william fudge has that for u, the Bible speaks about eternal torment or punishment for a long time then annhilation, I 'm not sure which one is right but I know hell is real and universalism is false."
5,Love the Movies? Buy the CD,"Say ""Woody Allen"" to any ten people and you're likely to get five hates and five loves. There's not much middle ground; either he's hilarious and a brilliant filmmaker or he's an elitist degenerate. Myself, I think he's one of the funniest men alive, to which this CD gives perfect testament. Allen's humor wasn't particularly political or expansively social like Bruce, Sahl, or Gregory. He did mostly short bits, and the subject matter will be familiar to those who have seen his films; his family, Judaism, growing up in New York, being a nebbish, his mixed results with women, etc. ""The Moose"" and ""Down South"" are my favorites; the first may be The Perfect Bit, with one of the great payoff lines of all-time.Basically, it depends on which side of the fence you stand, because this won't convert anyone. If you can't stand him, this probably won't change your mind. If you think his films are funny, you'll love this CD."
1,Buy the imported EMI double CD,"This is excellent material. Woody Allen was a brilliant stand-up comedian before he became a brilliant film-maker.This single CD, however, is badly edited (sometimes in the middle of a routine) to reduce what was originally a double LP set of 93 minutes down to single CD length.Search out the EMI import double CD of the same. Amazon has it. I just got mine. It is complete, and funny as hell as well as sophisticated.Even at really reasonable used prices, you'll be missing too much if you get this single disc."
4,Awsome book,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It takes you into various places such as in Russia, the figheter planes, NODAK, and satellites. It is one of the most excitable books.A must read book!!!!!!"
2,"Well written, but military details inaccurate","He, like several new technothriller authors, writes well, but his inaccuracies were widespread, from noting that people unfamiliar with pistols hit high (they anticipate and jerk it low) to F-14s closing to gun range (they aren't maneuverable, they'll stand off and use Sparrows or better yet and unmentioned in the book, Phoenixes) to nautical terminology (""heavy"" cruisers and indicating direction in points) to general naval knowledge (you don't escort carrier battlegroups or go inside enemy territorial waters with SSBNs) to secrecy (there are higher classifications than Top Secret). From a former Marine, I expected better technical details."
3,"Entertaining adventure in the Clancy style, pulls punch","This book, like many mid-to-late 1980s works, addresses a big concern of the time: would the US and USSR come to conflict, especially nuclear war? The Russian regime was already looking unstable, and the Americans suspected they'd prevail unless something went wrong and the world found itself entrenched in a war far more destructive than anything it had seen before. Written by an ex-military man, Defcon One describes a scenario where an insane and ailing Russian premiere attempts to provoke the US into attacking, with a wrinkle that I can't reveal because no one likes a spoiler. While the book is competent, and a really fun read, it eventually pulls its own punch and does not, like Clancy, get far enough into the horror for us to really feel the weight."
3,A difficult book to read but still good,"I don't know why the author did it, but he stuffed so much military jargon and slang into the book that I found myself lost on a number of occasions. The story was very interesting. A really good WWWIII book. I would have given it a 4 had I been able to comprehend what the author was talking about."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first and last Joe Weber book. The story was predictable and the characterizations were not compelling. It's not that Weber is a bad writer, it's just there are others who are so much better. I would rather read a bad book by a good writer than a good book by a bad writer. I love Clancy type books but this fell way short. He gets 2 stars for effort."
4,Very good biography.,"I enjoyed this documentary. You may find more thorough information, but this provides an excellent overview for those interested in Martin Luther and his contribution to the Reformation."
1,Documentary about commentators commenting on Luther.,"This documentary left me flat. It is mostly interviews with contemporary scholars, and Luther's theology is not the chief focus. Mostly the documentary focuses on Luther's impact on his times and on history. Luther is shown / portrayed briefly in a few scenes, first as a monk, then as an old man riding in an oxcart and later on his deathbed.Better choices: Luther (2003) with Joseph Fiennes, Martin Luther (1953) with Niall MacGinnis, and Luther (1974) with Stacy Keach."
2,sad,"I have been reading Sci-Fi, (Battletech in general) for many years. And, I think that this is the poorest example of Battletech writing since 'FAR COUNTRY' which i don't consider a Battletech novel at all."
3,An uninspiring but necessary sequel,"This book was a little slow in arriving, but don't get your hopes up. Until the end of the story, Gressman's writing style leaves you in a near-catatonic state as he repeats the objective of Task Force Serpent about every three or four pages. This could have been done so much better, by maybe taking more than a paragraph to resolve the assasssination of book 3, and also by getting to the invasion much quicker. As soon as the troops land, Gressman proves he can write. Problem is, he's out of ink! Next time, Tommy Boy, spend a little more than a 3-page chapter on each separate task force. Oops, he didn't even do that! The St. Ives Lancers, the Kathil Uhlans, and for the most part the Com Guards, are completely left out of the narrative. Considering the 100 + pages of filler in this book, seven or eight more chapters would have improved this it immensely. Well, at least, after five books, something is starting to happen..."
3,Could have been better.,This could have been a very good book but the author did a poor job of bringing the whole thing together. I want the next Stackpole book to come out.
3,Could be better,"This video's title is a little misleading. The video is not only about lions but other creatures of African night. It has interesting footage but a weak story. If you are interested in seeing a great lion documentary from the same region, watch ""Lions of Darkness"" instead."
5,Boundless Wisdom,"In Journey to the Boundless, Deepak Chopra explains that we do not have any control over our jobs and relationships. It is a better not to have control in those situations, that way we won't be frustrated over situations out of our control. Deepak Chopra also explains how we can break free of self imposed barriers to achieve our goals. I recommend this audio to anyone who wants to explore their intermost connection, between thier mind, their body and their spirit."
5,highly functional spiral binding,"I'll never go back to the old staple paradigm with all the advances of spiral binding at my fingertips.Well illustrated, easy to read.This is a high quality navigation tool."
2,So dumbed down as to be unbearable.,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. The subject matter fascinates me. but I just couldn't bear the stupidity of the writing. It feels like a TV documentary --- nothing is actually explained just as what it is. Instead everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, has to analogized and anthropomorphized. Nothing is ever simply stated if, instead, it can be presented in the form of an interview with another scientist.Look, if you enjoy science TV documentaries, maybe you'll love it. But if you can't stand stuff so dumbed down as not to be threatening to a 12 year old, give this a miss. Go read Sean Carroll's _Endless Forms Most Beautiful_, or Andrew Knoll's _Life on a Young Planet_, which are both fine examples of how to write popular science in a way that isn't irritating beyond belief."
2,"Honest effort, but I wasn't into it.","This cd was my least favorite by far. I do have all of their cds and I think they are great at what they do for sure, but for me, this cd only had about 3-4 songs that I liked, and out of those songs, none of them are my favorite Jam. songs. The cd is not bad, I just like the upper tempo, more layered songs more."
4,A great album with a nice vibe.,"As a child of the 70's, I missed the old school sound of Earth Wind and Fire and Stevie Wonder. I wondered whether anyone would be able to pick up where they left off. This album answered that question in the affirmative. With great grooves and Jay Kay's smooth vocals,and a surprising depth , this is a good buy for those who miss the old days."
3,It's definitely out of this world.,"If you buy ""Traveling Without Moving"" and then get this one, expecting the same fast-paced disco-type jams, boy will you be in for a surprise. ""Return of the Space Cowboy"" sounds completely different in the way that the songs are generally a lot slower, longer, and they include more horn, which is an instrument I noticed to be non-existant on ""Traveling."" I thought the record was pretty good, but it's just a little bit weird. If you don't have this one yet, I'd still recommend getting it, but be warned: other than Jay Kay's melodic voice, this record is almost a total 180."
2,All I can say is: it just sucked..,"With the same funk-disco style, yet without rythem or tone, Return of the Space Cowboy is a total flop. Most of the songs are unintresting, and as one song finishes and another starts, it seems as though it is the same song repeating, yet it is not. The lyrics are boring and it appears that Kay almost adlibbed the entire album, his voice is in no way related to the beat, he just goes off on his own, as if he were singing alone without any instruments, and added the music later. This is one CD not to waste money on.. I find it hard even looking at it without wanting to throw it as hard as I possibly can at the wall. If it was not for the cool title and weird guy on the cover with a hat, as well as a cool name for the band, there would be no stars for this sucker. In fact, I find it hard to listen to Kay's voice on this CD, I can only respect his kick ass hat..."
1,This album lacks everything except mediocrity.,Don't waste your time and money with this clowns. Get yourself some Stevie Wonder albums instead.
5,god cat fish liver sparkle,"their best album.acid jazz, dancey, discoey, big bandy, pop songy, funky, and more; there's quite a range of beats and arrangements.i've tried to find similar bands without much luck...air and morcheeba don't cut it. a modern stevie wonderesque band, perhaps.better than the other 3 albums because the tracks are tight, refined, perfected and not as amateur as their first album - but not as commercial and borderline boring as tracks from the newer albums. personal, emotional and full of pizzazz.terribly funky. classic cd."
4,The best of the 70's and the 90's put together,"It's rare that music can make you get up and move, and stimulate the mind at the same time.Jamiroquai managed to do that on ""Space Cowboy"" in the tradition of the best disco/jazz/rock fusion of the 70's but layered with turntable sampling and youthful rock bounciness.The music is rich, eclectic but always powerful and fun.There is the same knowledgeable mix as in mid-70's soul jazz, of soulful melodies,twirling synths, jazzy vocal scats, exotic percussions, syncopated beats, flutes, sax,etc.We travel through Space, Brazil, the Amazon, we walk down funky alleys, bounce off a dancefloor and we finally smoothly lift off into another groovy expedition.One of the best works of the 90's.Good vibes for all!"
5,Malmsteens answer to Dio,"Rising force & Marching out are the best releases from malmsteen, to date. A super polished ULI Roth,( at the next level ) made my ears wonder,how many fingers dose this guy really have ? Malmsteen, always admired the vocals of Ronnie James Dio. Unfortunately, the Attitudes were incompatible,I think Soto did a superb job w/ the voice. Later releases , showcase Joe Lynn Turner (excellent) & Michael Vescera on Vocals (a bit typical of a sound) The first 2 releases; mentioned above, also showcased the Johansson brothers on Drums & Keys ( Stellar Musicians ) ""A must have"", for the Guitarist or Metal Fan with the taste of neo-classical Shred."
2,He's a Viking.......I guess????,"I was a big fan of Yngwie Malmsteen's third album ""Trilogy"" so I picked up his other acclaimed 80's disks. Of the first 3, I have to say ""Marching Out"" is the weakest. The songs are repetitive, and nothing really stands out on the disk except for the single ""I'll See The Light Tonight"". The rest of the disk features some decent guitar work, but it's almost like Malmsteen's guitar is wedged into songs where it doesn't really fit. Tunes like ""Disciples of Hell"", ""Anguish and Fear"" and ""I Am A Viking"" are just calling out for a slow, Black Sabbath like guitar track as opposed to Malmsteen's blisting hair-metal-esque style. There is plenty of talent here for sure, but it's not channeled in the right direction. ""Trilogy"" seemed to capture the band at the top of their game, and everything came together. ""Marching Out"" feels as if the band is still trying to find their sound."
5,Just as good as when I was a teen,I loved this album...just as good as it was when I was a teen ager. Even my kids liked the guitar riffs.
3,An Okay Album,"I admit that this is my least favorite Yngwie Malmsteen album. The instrumentals on here are the best, but I feel that the vocal songs are not very good. I've never been a fan of the singer on this album. Buy this for the instrumentals. The songs with vocals just aren't that captivating."
2,"Great fret work, but the same runs.","This guy is an absolutely amazing guitarist, no doubts about it, but this album is so repetitive it's aggravaing. 5 stars for about 3 guitar solos on this record. The rest with the songs are just plain daft."
2,Disappointing,"I was very much looking forward to hearing this CD, but it was a very big disappointment. Whole first song did not play at all, in any player. Music quality only OK for rest of CD. Giving two stars is actually generous. Not worth the money."
4,Wonderful,I have searched far and wide for a book that covered a 90 honda prelude si. Extremely happy with it. Great instructions.
5,Greatest razor ever made.,Have tried almost every type of razor on the market. This old school 2 blade lasts forever and is heads above all the other competition. Less nicks and cuts and stays sharp along time. Believe all the excellent reviews. There is none better. You can't seem to find these anywhere but amazon now. Thank you gillette for continuing to make them and thank you Amazon for continuing to carry them.
2,disappointed,I bought this razor in the hopes of finding an inexpensive alternative to the bulky and pricey options currently on the market. I liked the small size and the cheap replacement cartridges. But i was disappointed. The razor is notably rougher on my face than my Schick Quattro - especially if I have skipped a day of shaving. This razor has been banished to the bathroom storage drawer where it will stay until I have time to donate it to Goodwill.
5,My favorite razor,This razor handles both 2 and 3 blade razor heads. It is hard to find a two head razor handle anymore (much cheaper than 3 blades and works just as good).
5,Best shave of my life! Time to downsize your blade count.,"When this razor arrived in the mail, the packaging had a date of 1993 on it. In 1993 I was glued in front of my TV watching Nickelodeon (those were the days!). If I had been shaving at the time, I would never have given up this razor.This was, without a doubt, the greatest shave of my life (well, maybe next to getting a straight shave with hot foaming cream and a neck massage). I had been using the Gillette Fusion and the Mach 3 before that. This blade puts those to shame. You will get a close shave with not nearly as much skin irritation. Couple that with a year's supply of blades on Amazon for around $20, and we have ourselves a winner!Don't waste another minute reading reviews. GET THIS RAZOR NOW!!!"
5,I love this razor,"Can't find these razors just anywhere and ther work very well, close shave and less cuts with these ones. Love them"
5,Gillette SensorExcel Razor,"Shipped fast and exact product ordered was received. Product worked great, was in new condition as advertised. Would order again."
3,Good,"This is good for the price. I had 4 full pack (a total of 16) catridges left and thats why I had to buy this razor. This is good, but then we are spoiled by the Fusion and all the latest ones."
2,I'd rate it higher if it were what I thought I was buying.,"That's right. You don't get the beautiful 2 blade razor. You're getting a 3 blade. Now, I prefer (meaning my face) a 2 blade razor. I don't understand all of these 4, or even 5 blades. It's out of control. They put out great products. Just make sure that you get what you want."
4,still works great after 13 years of using,I would not hesitate to use this razor if your looking for a great close shave this razor fits the bill.I have been using this razor for many years and just bought another so that should tell you something.
3,Falsetto Tale High,"I purchased this album long after I bought the first Live & More l.p. from 1978. I was disappointed with Once Upon a Time because of the style Summer chose to sing the vocals in; The whiny female falsetto (typical of the disco era, i.e. The Bee Gees). There are a few ballads on the album where she showcases her beautiful voice. On the Live & More album she sung a few of the tracks from the Once Upon a Time album in her ""normal"" sexy and sultry voice. Also, there was too much of the electric ""wah-wah"" guitar sound ( another trait of disco music) that was too superficial and annoying. Yet, the melodramatic, almost symphonic sound of the music was great; It certainly had a theatrical or Broadway feel to it ! All in all this album gets 3 stars for the Cinderella concept and thematic flow of the music throughout. Otherwise, her falsetto is not music to the ears !"
2,FAIRY TALE LOW,"This album is just about the cheesiest thing ever put on record. Now, I love Donna Summer but I think this is just about her worst album ever. When you set about to make a theme album and you purposely try to write songs about one topic it is painfully obvious and it sounds really forced. ""I Love You"" and ""Rumour Has It"" are the exceptions. While not her best work, they don't grate on your nerves like some of the other songs on this album do. You would do better to check out ""Bad Girls"", ""The Wanderer"", or ""Cats Without Claws"".Also the Quincy Jones produced ""Donna Summer"" is worth the price for the song ""Protection""."
5,The Mother of Techno,"I'm 30 and didn't discover this particular piece of Summer's work until just recently. Wow was I blown away. Not only is this an outstanding concept album but I consider this album is perhaps the conception of what is now ""techno"" music. It's as though Summer and crew traveled to the 90's and brought some of it back to the 70's. To the baby boomers Mrs. Summer may be the queen of disco but to this X'er she's the mother of Techno."
4,Nice Big Shelf System,"This shelf system is pretty nice for several reasons. One of the positive points of this is that you can insert cds into the other slots while listening to another cd at the same time, unlike many other shelf systems where you have to stop everything to reload new disks. When looking at it in the store on display, you wouldn't think it was that big, but actually placing it on top of your entertainment center, it looks pretty big. Another nice feature are the different settings such as Jazz, Rock, Pop, etc that you can indicate based on your preference of sound. A low point may be that you have to wait a little for the system to think about which cd slot and which song to play, and it makes a little noise while doing so. I got this as a gift, and overall, I'm happy with it so far."
1,Don't waste your money.,Priced right; looks okay -- only problem is it does not work. Will not properly connect with my iPhone and allows only intermittent charge.
2,Light will not turn on,"I bought this watch a few months ago and already shows some problems, it worked OK for a couple of weeks ,but now the dial light would not turn on. I suspect that the battery is running down, which is unnacceptable for a brand new item. I have no solution other than taking it to a shop to check. I can't hide that i am dissapointed with the NIKE experience."
2,Child's watch,This was a terrible buy I ordered an adult Nike Triax and recieved a child's Triax I was so embarrassed that it barely fit around my wrist. The worst part was that it wasn't even a good deal for ten more dollars which is what I payed for shipping. I could have got an adult sized watch at the local sports store.
1,Not a heating pad,This pad does not get hot. On highest setting it merely gets slightly warm. This is the second heating pad I purchased from this manufacturer with the same problem. It has become impossible to find a heating padthat truly gets hot without going to a truly high price specialty store. Returning this immediately. Complete waste of money.
2,Does not live up to its description,"Simply put, this pad does not get hot. Even on the highest setting, this pad barely gets warm enough to make any difference. While the wide elastic Velcro-close band is great, the pad does not NEARLY reach the 120 degrees that the chart on the side of the box suggests. The digital heating pad at my chiropractor's office is set at 100 and is perfect. Based on that, I would say that this pad probably only reaches about 85. Don't waste your money."
3,Good idea...,"I loved the idea but I agree that it simply doesn't get hot enough. It also has this v shaped cut out right in the middle which makes sense if you use it on your lower back, but if you want to use it for cramps it will miss a relatively large section. I do like the idea that you can wrap it around and velcro it in place so it's secure and you don't have to make sure you're in a certain position as with flat heating pads. I guess the name says it all though. SoftHeat is gentle warming only."
1,Not hot enough,"If you need heat, this is NOT for you. The quality is not very good either. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Arabia 1955ish,"""THE ARABS"" by HARRY B ELLIS (1958). (Sorry, limited info from a seller): The Story of the Arab People a dramatic, clearly written intro to their history, their culture, and their way of life by an author who -- as a Middle East Correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor -- learned to know the Arabs well.

Chapters: MORNING ON THE DESERT, MOHAMMED THE PROPHET, THE GOLDEN AGE OF EMPIRE, THE ARAB WORLD TODAY, MAP OF THE MODERN ARAB WORLD; also includes CHRONOLOGICAL CHART OF THE ARAB WORLD AND WORLD EVENTS."

5,Spellbound,"I have recently started reading books on the ocean & sailing authored by crusty old sea dogs.New to this genre I had no idea what to expect...However I was absolutely spellbound!!Tristans writing is colourful & entertaining, emotional yet humerous.I highly reccommend to anyone looking to pass some time.WARNING..This ebook could very well consume youre waking hours until completed.Love & Light"
4,"Riveting tale by a bold, unsung explorer.","Tristan Jones begins his post-WWII adventuring in a WWI vintage lifeboat he converted to sail. In this true story ""Cresswell"" becomes as lively a character as Jones himself and his half-blind, three-legged dog, Nelson.Together, the three take on the Artic sea and ice for a year in an effort to sail farther north than anyone had to date.At nearly every turn Jones, a salty Welshman, is tested by nature and circumstance and shows an indomitable spirit and a cleverness that has lessons and inspiration for all arm-chair adventurers.This unforgettable story is just the beginning of a lifetime of adventuring and writing that will make Tristan Jones as dear a friend to you as he was to the thousands of people of every nationality and caste the coastal regions of the world have to offer up"
1,Generic,"In a time where we should be promoting creativity and individuality, here comes the Jones' Gang, 3 washed-up rockers who try to sound modern but end up sounding empty and unoriginal. Not a single riff or hook on this album is anything new, it's all your old favorites rewritten to make some cash. Some facts:Kenney Jones played drums for the Who after Moon died. And after Moon died, so did the spirit of the Who.The lyrics on this album could have been penned by my 8 year old son.The label these guys are signed to is owned by TWEC, who also own FYE's and Where House music, the bane of existence to any self-respecting music buyer. As a matter of fact, if you go into a FYE's you will hear this CD blaring from the speakers in a pathetic attempt to sell you on it.I use mine as a coaster. Zero stars (although the lowest on amazon is 1)"
4,A Rocking surprisse!,"I purchased this mainly because of the price, but also by some word of mouth that has been going around about this. I really enjoy it, and agree with all the other positive reviews here. Especially enjoyable are the songs ""Six to Midnight"" (which harkens back to the bar-rocking days of The Faces (with Rod). ""Where Are You"" is very much a tip of a hat (or middle finger?) to The Who. They use this song to make a point on how Kenny was treated by the band/Roger/Pete? Anyway, fun to listen to on many levels. I awarded this with 4 stars, just because it is really a collection of various songs, without the feel of a fluid cd."
4,A fantastic review,I found this cd set to be an excellent review. I had studied French for years and just needed a thorough refresher course before a trip to Paris. I would recommend it to anybody who has studied a romance language in the past. I particularly like it because I can listen to it in the car and don't need to refer to a book. The phrase book is very sparse so I would not recommend it to anybody who has not previously studied a romance language.
3,Good if you don't plan on reading/writing French,"I have to admit, this is a GREAT collection for someone who has either had French in the past (and merely needs a review), or if you need to learn to speak French quickly without reading/writing it. The lack of a corresponding book forces you to rely solely on what you hear (you have no idea what the words actually are); you only know what they sound like, not look like. Because of that,it's easy to get lost and frustrated, unless you're willing to ""go with it"" and guess what you're supposed to be saying. If you've never spoken French before or wish to have a more complete understanding of the language, I suggest purchasing a dictionary, grammer book, and verb book to go with this lesson--or perhaps just skipping this one and buying another."
5,The best program out there!,"Living Language has been around for a long time (my mom knew about them!), but I guess there's a reason for that. These guys really know what they're doing. I loved the CD and the guidebook, and after studying with it, I felt very confident on my trip to France last fall. It's a great way to learn. PS There's even a dictionary included in the package!"
2,Not enough repetition,"Although the content of this program is excellent, I found it frustrating because the phrases are only stated once and there are not enough pauses to allow interaction from the listener. For this reason I prefer the Learn in your car French series that states each phrase in English and then twice in French allowing time in between for the listener to practice and interact with the tape."
3,All Audio French,Just occasionally listening to the CDs. Words and expressions are seeming more and more familiar.Au revior.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This cd makes the case for downloading only the good songs. There are only 2 good tracks on this 11-track cd: track 11 and track 7. I took the risk of buying this cd based on having heard the last track, ""Try"" in a movie; it was on the movie soundtrack, but I figured perhaps all of the songs on this cd would be similar. NOT SO! In fact, tracks 3 through 6 are utterly ""unlistenable""....and I mean LITERALLY. They sound like someone left the mike on inadvertently and captured...I DON'T KNOW WHAT!!! The duo has some talent given tracks 7 & 11. Why they filled the cd with this other garbage is beyond me. But at least I learned my lesson for good: ""NEVER BUY WHOLE CD'S AGAIN."""
1,This is not a new cd with new material,"Since this CD wasn't reviewed I incorrectly thought it was a new cd from one of my favorite performers, Freedy Johnston. It is a collection of old demo tapes from the eighties to the early nineties instead. The sound quality sounds like the original demo tapes and the material is not refined and sounds mostly like fractured ideas instead of songs."
4,TV a hit,I had this sent to my aunt who had a black and white 9 inch she has called several times to tell me what a wonderful picture it has.
2,"handfulls of discouragement, very different priorities","if you are planning your own wedding, and you are on a budget i would never recommend this book for you. i found getting through the whole book while planning our wedding comparable to being force fed handfuls of discouragement. most noticeably, her priorities are so far from my line. after reading her suggestions figures and budget, were so far off from do-able in my area, that i am positively more concerned for my shortcomings than i am excited for our day. if you are looking for a book to absolutely nitpick every tiny little head aching detail and unnecessary expense, than this is defiantly the book for you. i am absolutely discouraged and absolutely frustrated after reading this. in my opinion, if you have a budget under $20,000 do not read this book."
5,wonderful,"gave to my daughter for the future. i browsed through it before buying and i found it chock-full of information, helpful ideas and hints."
5,Amasing wedding planning book,That is THE book to get if you want to plan the perfect wedding with no stress ! I todelly recommand it. Perfect book for the perfect day !
5,Future issues for social work practice,Excellent condtion. Just as the seller descrided it. Have not read it as yet. Just browse through and I am looking forward to reading it and assimilating the information.
5,Excellent for maintaining sharp knives,"My husband and I have been very happy with this sharpener, which we've used for more about a year now. If you've let your knives go and they're quite dull, this SteelPro is NOT what you need. Get your knives sharpened, and then use the SteelPro to keep them that way...that's how a sharpening steel is meant to be used. I do have a Chef's Choice power sharpening station. It's a good sharpener, but too noisy and too inconvenient to use frequently. We use the SteelPro almost every time we use a cooking knife; we keep it right next to the knife rack, and give each blade a few strokes on each side before cutting or chopping. Since we started doing this, the knives have been in daily use and have stayed sharp. We do take good care of our knives, using appropriate cutting surfaces and storing them on a magnetic bar so they don't get dinged."
5,Works like a champ,"This is a terrific steel, very foolproof. I use this regularly on my chef knife that gets constant use, and it dramatically reduces the time between sharpens. For the money this item is tough to beat.I can't really understand why another reviewer would call this item dangerous, while the device itself is lightweight, with firm pressure applied with one hand while straightening the knife with the other, I can't imagine a much safer process. This tool also grips my kitchen counters just fine."
3,hawaiian ring,"This ring was well packaged & mailed very fast. I love the cutout flowers & the whole ring is a beautiful presentation. The one complaint is that the gold ring is very thin, I just hope it lasts. Very professional company. Again for $490.00 I expected a slightly thicker ring.Hawaiian Floral Ring in 14K Yellow Gold"
3,A liitle pricey,"I simply believe these box sets that have been coming out lately are too pricey. However if money is no object to you this is an interesting look into Miles live performances during this wonderful searching period. In addition there is a wild version of ""If I were a Bell"" where I believe Miles actually gets lost for quite a few bars. Again - too expensive - but otherwise recommended."
3,Why is this item so expensive?,"I'd probably buy the box set instead of the highlights, but $400? It should have gold CDs at that price.The reviews of this set are effusive, but it doesn't sound like the best of the great second quintet to me."
5,One Of The Greatest Albums Of All Time...Just Staggering!,"The song arrangements, vocals, lyrics and melodies on Arrive Without Traveling are staggering in their scope and application. Being a very eclectic buyer of nearly all types of music I was first introduced to this album by a very glowing 4 star review of the album in Rolling Stone magazine. I bought the album purely on the above average rave that the mag's music critic bestowed upon it. Hearing the first notes fly off of my record player I was in music heaven - This album exceeded my high expectations by leaps and bounds. Arrive Without Traveling is pure genius frozen in time, where everything around you waivers closer into focus: relationships, hopes, situations etc. Remember how Prince's 'Dirty Mind' came out of nowhere and shocked everyone senseless with its sound and scope? Well, this is of the same magnitude without as much expectation. Purchase at all costs!"
4,really good alternative band overlooked,"This is a great 80's alternative/new wave cd that never got the credit or attention it was do. More people prefer their first effort (16 Tambourines), but I personally think this is a much better album in total.They also rocked the house when the toured with REM on the Fables of the Recontruction Tour.If you like this, check out Permanent Green Light which was the leader's subsequent effort after these guys ended."
5,Sharp CDBA300,"I recieved this stereo for my 2001 Christmas and I would like to say its an excellent system. The remote isn't hard and unless your [not that smart], you can figure it out. The 6 equializer settings are great for almost any type of music. It also has the ability to be hooked into a TV for an enjoyable movie experience. The treble is loud, clear, and crisp. The bass will pound the floor and vibrate the walls, and the mid is great as well.The reciever itself contains many choices and options and has an excellent display. You have options such as sleep timer, alarm (which plays music to wake you up), and on recording. There is only one slight problem I have experienced with this stereo and it is the cd player. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to read certain cd's, but other than that its great.I highly recommend this stereo to anyone that wants a great stereo for the price."
3,bright and beyond age 2,"A great tool for exploring with your toddler. Some cards are better than others, but the good ones are really good! A good foundation for creative play, a lot of the items suggested are not ""around the house"" but one can make due. A definite winner for ideas."
1,Back Roads to Cold Mountain,I found this CD to be absolutely awful and completely disappointing. It was nothing like the musical CD Cold Mountain.
3,Pretty Good For A Dated Book,"This work by A.H. Chapman is 43 years old, and I admit that the reason why I wanted to read it was because I found two quotes in it that I thought were relevant to behavior today. The style and a lot of the material is dated, as cultural norms have changed over the years, but for a basic look at why we do what we do, Chapman's book is a good start."
4,Nice sampler of the Brazilian club scene,"Better-than-average electronica, from the late '90s Brazilian club scene. Some songs have a distinctive ""Brazilian-ness"" to them, although for the most part, I'd have to say this seems like the same old same old, as far as electronic dance and techno music goes. Certainly worth checking out, if that style is you bag."
3,Good Buy,"DJ Patife produces a competent example of Brazil's evolution of Britain's Drum and Bass. Tracks are loaded with Amazonian tribal beats, smooth vocals and nice references to the true urban experience D n B is a product of. Where this album falls short is in the exitement, tracks produced in colaboration with DJ Marky have given us in the past year or so.Try ""the Brazilian Job"""
3,old school sounds of drum and bass,"is a good disc, but the sound is from the school drum and bassDj patife is a very well dj and your sound is incredible!"
5,"Beautiful veneer, easy to work with!","We needed some wood veneer to do some repair work on our sailboat interior and used this. It is very easy to work with and after installation we are very pleased with how good it looks.This is over a year ago and the wood is holding up very well, even under moist conditions. I varnished it and it blends in with the older wood on our boat, looks like its always been there.I'm glad we found this source and would buy there again."
2,This album bored me,"Unless you are really into turntablism and samples, don't bother with this album. This album is best for DJ's and music nerds.I found it a little boring."
3,A TALE OF DIFFERENT STORY-LINES,"One is about a stream, the whole ecology of the stream,the animals, insects, fish, the whole environment surroundingthe stream. The other is the whole aspect of tree-hugging,pollution-this, erosion-that and man, himself, is the enemy!!!The animal-fish-stream part was very, very interesting.The tree-hugging, pontificating was over-the-top.The book WAS published in 1971, if that has any bearingon it. I think the world has changed, for the better, a lot,since then. I could be wrong, been wrong before."
3,gotta another tilt problem,"this is sick...first of all the tilt problem..that you CANT correct will drive you crazy. All they did was take an analog tv and stamped an Hdtv logo on it....hahaha this is not even close any hdtv 36inches and under including Zenith, Samsung, and Hitachi have a sick tilt problem. The the best picture out of all of them is the zenith...but hey ive takin back 7 tvs in a matter of 2 months..maybe im just picky."
4,end of the line ?,"People seem to think that Ian crashed and burned here after a good run of hard rockin'releases,but thats not true at all. On this one he settles down a little. But with the aid of Jannick Gers he cranks out another quality hard rock album. The production is slick and the tunes are not as brash as the previous arena anthems. But this is a rewarding listen if you just leave it on and listen to the man sing. Its still heavy even though this marks a return to more versatile set list.One of the better Gillan albums. If you have a Gillan collection you need this one.4 stars instead of 5 for changing directions again, and keeping fans confused."
3,More oily than I thought it would be,"Because of the other 2 reviews, i bought a bottle of Zum lotion. I've been using Indigo Wild Zum Bar Goats Milk Soap Frankincense and Myrrh and i Love it's smell. The smell of the lotion is the same, however, because everyone is so different, i was disappointed by how much more oily it is than i had hoped."
1,"have not recieved my product yet ,can't review until i use it.","I ordered zum body frankincense & myrrh, I recieved zum soap,I'm still waiting on my original order.have not recieved any word from amazon."
3,smell of the lotion doesn't suite me,It absorbs quickly and completely and leaves skin oh so smooooth but the smell of the lotion doesn't suite me. I would love it if this also came in a variety pack with nice smell. I also ordered the Bay laurel foot and leg lotion and found it to be just as great. I will be ordering more of this as the weather cools.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"This is not the Ib Melchior 1964 version of The Time Travelers. It is instead a 2-disc set that contains four films. ""In the Year 2889"" ""Journey To The Center of Time"" ""Idaho Transfer"" and ""The Day Time Ended"". All four films are presented in terrible condition with heavy scratches on both disks. Hopefully I can return this horrible purchase without spending more than $8.99 for the return shipping. Save your money and buy something else!"
3,Only for the serious science fiction addict,"The movies are: In the Year 2889, Journey to the Center of Time, Idaho Transfer & The Day Time Ended. A mixed bag for sure. Idaho has the most interest whereas Journy is probably the most known. These are mostly MST3K material at best but OK for the price. I really wanted the movie ""Time Travelers"" to be included but it was a grab bag."
4,A good assortment,"I really do like this CD sampler a lot. The music is a broad distribution of music from around the world exemplified by excellent musicianship.I have discovered some new types of music that I now would like to explore further. My only complaint is that the music track selections do not always show the best offerings of a particular musician or group, even from a single album or year. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable album."
1,Bad choice,"What a waste of time and money in my opinion! Do you really want to hear songs from Cuba, Spain, Italy, France , Mexico? Don't search anymore; Listen to ""fuerza"". Manu Chao, Carotone, Macaco and plenty more give an excellent introduction. Mixing reggae, ska, rock will satisfy everybody. Feel the ""fuerza"" Joanna!"
2,Hel-LO!,"I wanted to like this book more than I did, but I just found a lot of it to be, like, lame! Savan has some good points but she repeats herself so much, drowning every sentence in 'pop words' that offset other 'pop words' reminding her of even more 'pop words', that large parts of the book are a convoluted mess!Much of the ground has been covered elsewhere, in greater detail, and in less headache-inducing style!I did find some interesting nuggets, but had to skim through a lot of tedious material to get there. Fans of language should check it out if they're curious. People who can do without socio-political commentary should skip it."
1,A horrible mess of a book. Just a jumble of so many loose thoughts.,"I found this book to be very poor. The author seemed to have taken a collection of columns and simply thrown them in a ""Andy Rooney"" blender and had this be the result.Additionally, the author seems unable from having to shove her ""Village Voice"" politics down the reader's throat at every chance.The writing comes across as forced, especially when she seems, so very desperate to be funny. Let's just say, Dorthy Parker she isn't.There are too many other books on this enjoyable subject to waste your money on any of her works."
3,"Like, a total ripoff, but whatever","This is an anemic version of the cliche smackdown you'll find in Balistreri's The Evasion English Dictionary. (Oops, I said ""smackdown."" Sorry, Savan.) Get that book for the definitive breakdown of ""like"" and ""whatever."" Too much of Savan's book is a laundry list of common phrases that do not need proof of their ubiquity. While these exhaustive lists do show the degree of repetition of phrases in media, they do not distinguish between cliches that merely fail to illuminate and cliches that are deliberate manipulation. Also, the writing style isn't dazzling enough, or witty enough, to serve as an example of an alternative to these dumb cliches."
1,This book is a waste of time.,"This book is mostly nonsense. Leslie Savan should go live in Old Bethpage restoration or Colonial Williamsburg where she can converse all day long using the King's English. I think her desire to have these inspired conversations in American society would put us all to sleep. Read the NY Times review of this book and you will see what I mean. I see no point in an investigation of so-called ""pop language"". Investigating such things winds up perpetuating such things and giving them more attention then they deserve. Just stop watching FOX and reading People magazine and everything will be fine."
5,2 pups favorite toy,"Empty, filled with canned kong puppy treat or with dry food, my labradoodles love this. Plus it is so cute to see them walking around with it."
2,Dog ruined in nearly 2 weeks,We bought this in pink for our male Labrador Retriever puppy.It starting falling apart in nearly 2 weeks.The rubber is nothing compared to the Kong classic.We bought the Kong Classic and is lasting way longer than the Kong Binkie ever would.
5,A WINNER,"My Great Pyrenees Pup loves this, its the only thing that has helped her teething. She always chooses it first over anything else. And it has held up to her massive jaws, no health hazard in pieces coming off at all. I think Kong makes the best dog products ever."
4,Another great series,"By a wonderful storyteller. I read The Corps series, and loved it, so could hardly wait to read Griffin's story about the Philadelphia Police Department. I found the same great, strong characters, and the same insider's look into the people that make up a big city's Police Department. I love Griffin's brand of storytelling that seems so real. And there is no shortage of action either in his books, and this book, the first in the Badge of Honor series, is no exception. The book starts with the killing of a senior Police Officer, and the action does not let up from there. I am sure there will be no end of heroics in the coming books either, and I can't wait to read them. Inspector Peter Wohl promises to be a strong and interesting character. Thanks Mr. Griffin for the hours of enjoyment that you provide for me."
1,Couldn't connect,Griffin is a knowledgeable and talented writer of whom I have read several other books but this one just never caught on. I just couldn't get into the plot or the characters. Everything felt cliche or off and I just couldn't enjoy this book like many of his other ones.
2,Rotten Ending!,"I've liked every Griffin book I've read to date, until this one -- which I enjoyed until the end. No spoilers here -- but it utterly ruined it for me. I wont read the rest of this series. Try the Presidential Agent Series instead -- awesome!"
5,This book and the others in the series are non-stop action!!,"The books in this series are so intricate and complex. The author has provided so much as to detail that he has painted an accurate picture of police work, inner politics, and the workings of investigations. I have all of the paperbacks so far in the series andI am getting the newest one soon. My only problem is that I can't put them down and never get anything else done!"
2,OK Book,Not as good as the Dummies series which has better written and illustrated books on this subject.
4,Great book I couldn't put it down.,"Mr. Harris where are you? ""Inv. Life"" is an excellent eye opener for those who still are in the dark thinking that people CHOOSE to be out of the sexual norm.(If there is such a thing). The dialogue between Raymond and his father has been played over many times in families. Understanding is the key and the aurthor clearly shows it in a funny and heart-warming way in this superb book. Two thumbs and a ""Z"" snap.:)"
