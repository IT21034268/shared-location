3,"It is ok, not great","I bought this item under the assumption that i could use it to play my ipod in my car but when i finally recieved the item, it turned out that it is just a charger. the part that mislead me was the ""travel adapter"" and the comment a person made that they could listen to the ipod and charge it. the chargers work but i will have to buy an actual adapter to use to play in my car."
1,I've never receive the adapters!,"I've been in a Orlando Hotel where I asked to ship the adapters, but my purchase never appear. Now I'm at my country again, and I have to left it in Orlando.....I would like to send again to another place in Miami, where some friends are going in few days. Is Possible?"
1,Thi,This this sucks they were broke and they didn't even send me any new ones they are not a good company that cares about their customers
1,POC,This is trash. None of that crap worked with none of the Apple products I have. Really bad. Don't waist your money.
5,charger,I purchased a charger for my Ipod that included both wall and car chargers. It cost me $2.23 including chipping and works great. What a buy!
3,Not as presented,"I received my order and was disappointed. 1. The product didn't come packaged up in a prepackaged unit. The items were thrown together in a zip lock bag. 2. The patch cord wasn't anything like was was presented. It was some cheap retractable unit. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, considering the cost. I based everything off the pictures."
2,not good quality,"I recieved the product really fast everything is good eccept car charger, its didn't work. I am understand you get what you pay, but I better pay more instead of recieving bad quality product."
4,My previous review was updated to 4 stars,"I rated 1 star for the product since it didn't work for the first time. However after playing with the cord for a while and have my ipod acting kind of strange, I finally got the product to work. So hopefully it will keep working fine. So for now I'm happy with the product. Great choice for the price."
5,Handy accessories for the iPOD,"What more can you say about a product that works as well (and simple) as this suite of power accessories for the iPOD?In my opinion, it's one of the best values on the market."
1,Prong disconnected when pulling from outlet,"When my child pulled the unit from the outlet, one of the prongs stayed in the outlet. This was an extremely dangerous situation! Luckily my 8 year old child came to me to let me know this happened. Had he touched the prong in the outlet could he have been shocked? I turned off the electricity to my house before dislodging the prong from the outlet."
4,read the small print,"Product arrived and was working fine as advertised. Happy customer!. However, when ordering this, I mistakenly assumed it would be from one of Amazon's normal suppliers, providing a few day mail service. Though it was plainly stated on the ad for this product, that delievery was anticipated 5-6 weeks in the future, even though the product was in stock. I failed to pick this up.When confirmation from the seller came that the product was shipped, it also stated this at that time, I realized that the product was being shipped via mail from Hong Kong, which ultimately took 2 weeks from the shipping date.Not a big deal, and Amazon and the seller clearly noted this on their ads, but the buyer should read all the small print, and if the product might be needed in a short time period, seek out alternative delievery or supplier to purchase the unit from."
1,Terrible Quality,"The price was great, so I went ahead and ordered it, but I guess this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for. The cable charger would begin to charge, but would never charge for longer than five minutes. It was like it got a bad connection, or didn't fit my Ipod exactly right. Therefore, none of the adapters worked, since the cable wouldn't work to begin with. A waste of time and money!"
1,damages ipods,This charger is no good. it fried my daughters ipod touch on christmas morning. The apple store said it was the charger. It was a power surge thru it. I contacted the company and they said they would refund my money but not replace ipod.
1,Doesn't work!,Does not work at all major piece of crap. I would love my money back!!! Do not buy unless you like to waste money. Cheaply made def spend a like extra cash and buy a better product.
1,Blah,The only good thing about this was I didn't spend a lot of money. I bought thist charger to keep in my car for my iPod touch I only got to use it once before it decided that it no longer wanted to be compatable with iPod. Not a very device at all.
1,Not happy!,"I was excited to get this kit and did not mind waiting the extra time for delivery, as the product was shipped from China. To my dismay the car charger doesn't work. When I plugged it into my iPhone 4 the message "" this device isn't comparable"" and it would not charge my phone. Nice price but worthless."
5,about product,I bought these items for my daughter's I pod & she loves them. She's been wanting a car charger for it because she is always on it everywhere we go. It was a great deal & fast service.
4,kit,so far so good. seems a little rinky dink but for the price you can't complain. working well thank you
3,Only charges to half the full amount,"Looks great, very functional, but only charges to half the full amount. Havent had the chance to use the car charger but I am sure it will work hopefully will charge to the full extent."
1,Cheap,I was only able to use this item a few times. It has a hard time charging and is cheap in its ability to perform.
3,"the product is OK, customer service is good.",The retractable cord keeps on stuck after used occasionally for a month. Customer service is nice and sent the replacement without a charge.
2,iPod travel kit,I don't like this at all. Seems to be cheaply made and put together. The pieces fit and all but the quality is crap.
3,travel kit,Everything is working but the charger for the house. That is really the only reason I got everything else but it is nice to have all the other stuff too.
2,Doesn't charge,"I bought two units and neither one of them would charge my iPad, iPhone or iPod. I believe the problem is in the plug itself."
5,Charger.,"I use those pieces of chargers all the time, it is a great product. I recommend this bundle to anyone, and the price was perfect."
1,You get what you pay for,"Past reviews ought to be heeded, indeed. This is essentially a piece of junk which'll last you a few months, if lucky. Not worth the risk."
3,Its ok,The wire was good but after a few weeks they started to rip and the other two charger was still working though.
2,"cable good, not adapters",The retractable cable is really nice. The power adapters are cheap and do not work though. The house style plug will not even charge and ipod when it is used. Same cable in other adapters works fine though. Same with the vehicle adapter. Cheap made in China stuff.
5,great,I bought this for my son. He loves it and uses it everyday. Never had a problem with it. Will buy again if need be.
1,Horrible Charger,Charger overheated 2 brand new ipods that then had to be completely replaced. Not something i would recommend and I will not use this product again.
1,why iv don't like the chager because...,I hate it because it looks terble. also the cable it comes with it dosen'nt. fit in the ipod this why i do not like this.
1,I didn't get all of them,"i didn't get travel adapter. I got two car charger and cable for ipod. Actually, i ordered this items for travel adapter but i didn't get that one. so, how can useful these items for me?"
1,Almost caused a fire!,"The wall charger did not charge the product. While plugged into the wall it shorted out and had sparks coming out of it. Luckily my son's Ipod was not attached and we were at home. Had we not been home, we could have had a fire. The cord that came with the set was in a retractable case, this broke with the slightest of pulls. I will not allow my son to try the car charger as I won't take a chance on messing up the electrical system in the car. I have contacted the seller about returning the items and will see if I can do so. Would not recommend this item to anyone.The seller has offered a full refund so I am pleased with their response."
1,poor charge,"I bought two kits, neither of the car chargers work. I would not buy again. Fortunately, the cost was low enough that I didn't lose much. I would not recommend this kit."
5,yay!,it arrived in less time than it said it would and everything was in the package and it all works :)
1,worst purchase i ever made,i ordered this in november 5th and i am still awaiting the arrival its feburary 2nd and i still have not received it i paid imediatley and ended up just waisting my money. im writting this to express and let my problem with this product be known it is just terrible considering i still have not received it. i do not recomend buying this!!!!
4,its ok,"I puchased this item in spite of the reviews because of its price, and it is true is not high quality, I haven't had any trouble with it so far, so it fits the pupose."
3,"If you need a charger really bad, this is a really bad charger","At first I didn't think this worked. It doesn't plug in easily and you need to jiggle it around before the iPod will indicate there's a connection. However, I'm giving it 3 stars because I really didn't expect much for such a cheap price. I'm just happy it works."
1,No Good,"I received this product in a an unzipped zip lock bag. There was no packaging, no branding. The charger did not charge my ipod. The usb did not work from my ipod to my computer. Totally useless. I emailed and they offered me a refund if I ship it back. What a pain. Don't buy this product."
2,Cheap & not worth it,This car charging kit is cheap & breaks easily. The car charger never worked but the wall charger did most of the time.
1,Cheap,This item started smoking the first time we plugged it into the car. Imediately removed and threw in the trash. Cheap item I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Car Charge doesn't work,"Cable works well, but car charger not valid for my ipod touch 4 - swore I read was approved for this product"
2,Won't fit if you have an OtteRbox type case,"The charger worked fine but once I put my iPhone into its otteRbox case, it no longer fits. My husband has a Ballistic case, which also doesn't allow the use of this charger. It seems only the Apple brand charger will fit."
3,Half works.,"Its ok. The car charger works well, but the adapter never works. iPod always says accessory is not supported for charging."
1,DOESNT WORK!,"THe charger doesnt work. The light is red, but no charge. grrrr. I guess you get what you pay for. beware"
1,Poor product,The wall plug did not work when it arrived. The cord DOES NOT work with a case on your phone. The metal plug part that goes into the phone is shorter than the Apple brand therefore you have to take your phone completely out of any protection case you would have it in and that is just a pain in the bu**. I bother trying the car charger.Item arrived quickly and store said I could return it for a refund but since it was only $2.50 to begin with I would spend that much in postage to return it. Not worth bothering with.This is the second cord I have bought from Amazon and this one stinks (my other one is great) so pass this one by and keep looking.
1,Disapointed,I should know by now that you get what you pay for. Bought 3 sets the AC wall adapter broke on 2 of the 3 in the first 3 weeks. Other components work ok so far.
1,Pathetic charger,"This charger does not do anything as mentioned, when I connected my Ipod or Iphone it says charging for hours and does nothing. I will have to then charge it via my traditional approach (Apple provided charger). Product was of no use at all and I am now looking for a reliable product to charge my Apple products in the car :("
1,worst ever!!,I bought this charger 3 day ago. I got it in 2 days. The first day i had it i unpluged it and the plug that goes into the itouch broke in half! Needless to say I absolutly hate this product.
1,A complete waste of money,This thing isn't worth cheap plastic that it's made of!!! The plug will not stay in the socket so it does not charge at all. Amazon should not allow this to be sold on its site!!!! You'll do better buying a cheap charger at the check-out stand at TJ Maxx or Marshall's!
2,it not cool,i bought this product because i needed a car charger but the cord which is the most thing needed doesn't work i thought it was nice cause i could change the length of th e cord but it doesn't work!!!!!! but I love the car charger it woarks perfectly and so does the plug in part.
2,Car charger broke,The car charger strated to catch fire the very fist time i plugged it in. I just pulled it off quickly but it was already burned. I still using the rest of the kit.
2,Cable doesn't work,"This purchase came with cigarette lighter plug, a wall plug and wire connector to charge my Ipod.Plugs are built out of light weight plastic and work fine. the wire, however, appears to not connect to the Ipod properly since the unit doesn't light up and the battery won't charge.In my case, I use my original Apple USB cable to charge my Ipod at home or in the car.Overall is not a bad price but don't expect everything to work."
4,Ipod,Took a while to get the product but arrived sooner than the date promised. Product is good and I am pleased with overall performance.
5,Functional and Affordable,I love this! I can plug my ipod in my car now and it charges while Im listening to it! No more having to charge it on my computer and taking it back and forth between the car and home. Works perfectly. I love it. :)
1,Poor Quality,"The quality of this is ""GENERIC OFF BRAND"" product lacking. One of the 4 sets I purchased was cracked and another one of the AC Adapters is no longer conveying a charge. I would NOT recommend this product. Also, their was a shipping time of 8+ weeks (shipped from China)."
1,Cheap!,I guess u get what you pay for! Cheap! Car charger only worked for about a week. Charger does not fit tight enough to keep contact to charge.
1,pretty much junk,This kit was supposed to charge an IPod Touch 4. The only thing that the Touch 4 would accept was the car charger. The supplied cable came apart within a few uses. When I tried connecting the Touch to an outlet using the plug-in charger the Touch 4 displayed a note saying it was not compatible. It is better to spend a few extra $ and get a Belkin or Apple Charger.
2,Not Great!,"Product lasted about 2 weeks and home plug charger gave out. would not charge the phone any longer, usb adapter worked but the plug to the wall did not. Not happy, it was cheap so you get what you pay for, just a heads up!"
5,USB Travel Kit,I'm very glad i purchased this product. As what came with the IPOD you could only plug in to a computer. This as a plug you can recharge without using you computer.
1,Doesn't work,"This is supposed to charge iPods, but it does not charge either of my iPods- nano or iTouch. I would not recommend."
5,great product & expedient delivery,"I purchased 3 of these, one for me, one for my daugher and one extra one. I received the product in a very expedient manner and am very pleased with how it works...thank you!!"
3,Get want u pay for.,"The car adapter stopped working after two weeks, home charge and cable still working. Just not happy with car charger. Will buy car adapter from local store now."
1,lasted one month! JUNK!,"Well, for the price I should have known. It lasted one month. I contacted them to see if I could get a replacement but no luck.Would not recommend this item. A piece of junk."
2,"Functional, but Better Value Products are Out There","Have had mine for many months--all components work as advertised--but I seldom use them, because I found better stuff out there. These parts are cheap, awkward, and ugly. The retractable cord works, but it's so darned short that it only makes sense to use it for computer connections--if I used it with the supplied adapter, I'd have to leave my phone on the floor to charge. The adapters haven't given me any grief, but I prefer the smaller, sleeker Apple styling (which is affordably available via a wide array of knock-off products). My $0.02: keep looking!"
4,They Look Like Raviolis or Pillows!,"My cats love these treats which I call their raviolis, even though I can't tell if they prevent hair balls.Nonetheless, for less than 3 bucks, you can't go wrong."
5,Pounce hairball treats,"This product has come in very handy with our long-haired cat. We alternate between lax'aire (the gooey stuff in the tube from the vet) and the hairball treats which are especially helpful when we are away from home and the petsitter can give these without getting near our (rather unfriendly, even to the hand the feeds her) cat.EG"
5,Five Good Reasons,Here are Five Good Reasons why I like this book:1. I can pick it up and just open it and each double page will have a relevant and practical way for me to come back to center.2. It is a nifty size to stash by the bedside.3. It would make a terrific and welcome gift.4. It reminds me of what is important in a sometimes insane world.5. The suggestions in the book really do take just five minutes.
2,Dull and repetitive,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but when I finally did, it was a huge disappointment. ""5 Good Minutes"" should be ""5 Good Pages,"" which is about as long as this book should have been. It's dull, suprisingly repetitive, and boils down to one word: Mindfulness. If there weren't already a dozen very good, well-known books on this subject that are more approachable, applicable and practical, I may have given it more stars. On the other hand I may not have, since the prose is as lackluster as the content. I've never seen an author make mindfulness and meditation sound so boring before.I also got ""5 Good Minutes in the Evening"" at the same time. It was almost exactly the same, and so was my reaction to it."
2,Too Free Spirited for Me,"I was hoping this book would be a bit more concrete in suggestions and ways to do exactly what the title implied, but I found it to be too free spirited and 'out there' for my personal liking. It just wasn't enough to motivate me to give it even 5 bad minutes each morning."
4,Good morning,"I put on meditation music, go to a page in the book and follow along with it. After approx 5 mins I go get a much better start to the day"
1,Try Instant Karma,I wish this book had a lower price or more information. Try Instant Karma. A great Book with 8700 ways.
5,Mind-spirit music at its best,"This album is one of the most remarkable tribal-ambient. Newby is superb in creating the image of the place he wants to take us to, and this place is very far yet very deep inside. A vivid dream, a personal experience of past, future, and absence of time... I'll leave it to you to balance.Newby got a special sparkle both in the way he composes and the sound character. Very good sound quality, combined with the contents for a superior sonic experience.This album is a masterpiece and is greatly overlooked.It's my favourite of all of his work, probably because the trip is very personal.I also recommend ""Ecology of Souls"", but Sirens is a bit more to my taste becuase it's more corresing and forgiving - you can already tell by the name - Sirens (-:Of coase that Trance Mission's ""Meanwhile"" and ""Head Light"" are also increadible, as well Newby's colaboration with Roach and Kent on ""Halcyon Days"", a very good album."
5,Kenneth Newby - 'Sirens' (City Of Tribes),"Follow-up to Kenneth Newby's 'Ecology Of Souls' (see my review) but I believe I, personally like this - his second solo outing ('97) a bit better. Total of nine tracks to fully take in here, yet they're much shorter in length than the material on 'Ecology Of Souls'. Tunes that definitely make this disc a keeper are the 'traditional' song ""Saraswati"", ""Howe Sound"", the nine-minute ""Fathom"", ""Sirens II"" and the wailing ""Mistress"". Couple of instruments employed on this CD that Newby didn't use on his 'Ecology Of Souls' were the didgeridoo, harp and electric fiddle. So, 'Sirens' is indeed a step forward."
3,Uninspiring,"Although competently written, ""Icognito"" is a pale imitation of Georgette Heyer's classic regency romances. The plot was predictable and the characters were one dimensional stereotypes. There was some witty dialogue, but not much. The book was short and when it was over it was quickly forgotten."
3,Very Good,"I really liked the gentleman getting the pressure this time. The story was fun, and the predictable end was very satisfying. Looking to lighten your mood? Read this :-)"
2,"Silly, juvenile and without heat","This is a minor effort. The writing is unsophisticated, and the plot is contrived (even by romance novel standards)."
5,Amazing recipes,"I love this book. The recipes are so easy, so economical and so very yummy! For those families that don't have the time to spend in the kitchen, these are the recipes for you. Because each recipe has only 4 ingredients, your shopping bill won't be astronomical and you can try a new recipe just by flipping a page. Fantastic recipes! You've gotta try these!"
4,Perfect!,"We were growing tired of cooking when I found out about this book. We bought all sorts of ingredients and things that we only needed once, and then the recipes weren't even that good. We were skeptical about this book. Only four ingredients? 800 recipes? But we ordered it anyway, and it saved our love of food and our budgets!"
5,This Busy Mom Loves It,"This is an indispensable cookbook for me when I need something quick that I have all the ingredients for. Just recently made the apricot bars-4 ingredients and had company that loved it. Going to pick up another one for a niece who is new to cooking. I like to cook and will do more complicated recipes, but this fills the bill when I get home from work and have 3 boys demanding, ""When's dinner?"""
4,True dramatic criticism,"A remarkably well-ordered attack on British theatre. Though it contains slightly inflammatory language in certain passages, overall, it is a good example of early dramatic criticism. I enjoyed it, and agreed especially concerning the denigration and abuse of the clergy on stage. It seemed well-substantiated, and I believe it was one of the first examples of what we today would consider theatre criticism. It was instrumental in reforming British theatre through a controversy that sprang up about the piece."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book was not terrible, but was quite dry. It talked mainly about how teachers should approach teaching students with multiple intelligences. One thing I did like though, was that Gardner described his seven intelligences. This was more of what I was interested in. It gave me something to personally relate to. For teachers, this book would be excellent, but for an ordinary person, I wouldn't recommend it. It's wordy in the middle of the book, but the beginning catches your attention by describing the intelligences. They also give examples of the intelligences. The examples make it easier to understand and possibly relate to."
4,Gift reception,"I haven't seen this collection myself, but the recipients seem happy with it. The product came in a timely fashion."
5,Classic Musicals,I have a copy of this set. I bought another set of this GREAT COLLECTION to give as a gift and it was greatly received. Everyone who likes Musicals should own this collection.
5,GREAT,These are some of the best musical films ever made. What a value to get them in one collection. A bargain! Great entertainment for all ages.
5,great value set,"its a lovely collection to have at a affordable price.it contains two double disc editions.documentary on judy garland is one sided but still informative,it presents a gloomy picture of her life.finian's rainbow is quite an exciting musical,petula clark sings beautifully,the print is really great and quite amazing.its a great set to add to your collection."
4,Nice but. ....,"great bag, but the velcro and flap, and even the straps leave me really confused on how this thing rolls up. Maybe mine missed HongKong QA process and the roll up is backwards.Regardless, a simple one page diagram would've been a good insert to have in the packaging."
2,Not very pretty in person,"I ordered these and returned them. They looked cute online and I love Aerosoles for work (I'm in sales and running all over town all day) but when I got them I thought they weren't very attractive -- actually a little cheap looking. They were comfortable, though."
4,Perfect gift for a Carson fan,This book was given as a gift to a Carson fan. It was very well received and we felt we had given the perfect gift.
5,Fascinating and rare behind the scenes tidbits,"Author Cox does a nice job sharing all of the insider's info about Johnny Carson and his famed ""Tonight Show."" Best of all, there's lots of celebrity interviews with favorite guests from the show's 30 years plus a look at Steve Allen and Jack Parr, as well as Joan Rivers. VERY comprehensive."
5,"TONIGHT, or any time, a fun & fascinating read!","I took time to revisit this book, after the sad news of the other day. I forgot how much fun I had reading it the first time around. A great late-night visit down memory lane!"
5,DEMDACO Willow Tree Dreaming Angel Figurine,I love the figurines from Willow Tree and have collected quite a few over the years. They are quite charming. I would recommend these.
5,A fantastic gift,I bought this figurine with many of the other Willow tree figurines for my daughter for Christmas and she was absolutely happy for the gifts.
4,New Direction for MTX,"This album is a step off the beaten path for MTX. If you are a fan of MTX, you'll have to get over the initial shock of the more (or dare I say over-)produced sound. But the songs are still there. It grew on me. When I saw them live on this most recent tour, I was up front, so I couldn't hear the keyboard being pumped through the mains, and it sounded like the raw(my preference) MTX. Franks lyrics shine on this one."
2,Don't Bother,"The Mr T Experience was always a dark horse in the running of being my favorite band. They had a great upbeat sound and Dr. Frank's voice was perfect for singing his astoundingly clever lyrics. I don't know what they were thinking on this album, but all that is gone. The songwriting, while trying to sound more mature or sophisticated, has lost all its charm. Worst of all, Dr. Frank's singing is so bad that even the halfway decent songs on the album are unlistenable. This album is a major disappointment since all their albums before this were becoming consistently better."
2,Ugh!,"Well, MTX has always been great, until Alcatraz. The Sound is just so much different, it's almost painful to listen to. Dr. Frank has to work on his vocals."
1,They slipped off in my ears!,"When I first got the headphones (E3c) I tried all of the sleeves, trying to find a good balance between comfort, ease of use, and sound quality. It is important with all of them to insert them correctly to get a good seal, and therefore good sound.I really liked the Ultra-soft sleeves because they were simple to put in, had a good seal, and were confortable to wear. Unfortunately they are so soft they slip off of the stem if they are in too deep. This happened to me twice (I know, fool me once...)! My wife had to get in there with tweezers to get them out. I have read that I'm not the only one. Others have had to go to the hospital to get them out. Beware!"
3,Just barely latin,"I ordered this DVD because I love the Crunch Cardio Salsa with Giselle Roque de Escobar. Unfortunately this DVD pales in comparison. I like that it is fast-paced and will cause you to work up a sweat, but there is very little latin styling or latin music involved. If you are a die hard latin workout fan like me, get the Crunch Cardio Salso instead, or Lisa Nunziella's 5-day latin dance system. Both are much better than this one."
2,No Instruction!,"When I saw the preview to this video, I thought it looked like something that would be fun and fairly easy to follow. It's Not! There is absolutely no instruction in how to do the different dance steps involved in the routine. If you already know Latin dance, you could probably follow, have fun and get a great workout. But for those who don't, don't waste your money. The workout team obviously spent a LOT of time learning the routines."
1,Worst workout dvd ever!,"I have used lots of other fitness dvds and this one is the pits. It feels more like the instructor is showing off the moves rather trying to get the viewer to do them. There is no learning time for moves, no repeats and definitely non-encouraging. There are tons of fitness videos out there to try..take my advice stay away from this one. The Dance of Inches ""Ballroom dancing"" is excellent so is the Hip Hop party."
4,Good length for exercise and comfortable rythym.,"I like this video because it is lively, has a good beat and is not to hard to keep up with. A lot of work out videos are just too hard to do. This one is just right."
4,A fun way to get fit,"I lost 10 kgs by exercising every morning with the ""Crunch Fitness"" and ""Gotta sweat"" programmes on ESPN several years ago.Now I am need of losing that weight again so I purchased 3 of the Crunch fitness titles. This is my favourite. As a lover of latin music it certainly encourages me to get up and workout each morning.I just wish there were Cory Everson would release her ""Gotta Sweat"" programmes on DVD."
2,Not a fan of Crunch,"I'm a huge Jennifer Galardi fan and I own almost all of her DVDs... but this one immediately went in the closet with all my other rejected workout videos. I don't know what it is about Crunch, but I just can't get into their DVDs. The music is awful, the cheesy dancers in the background are distracting, and it just makes me want to run and hide from the campiness of it all. Love Jennifer and love working out with her, but I won't be putting this DVD back in the player."
3,Crunch: Latin Rhythms,This does keep you moving but a little hard to follow the foot steps. I have no dance experience(just that I like to dance) and find it a little difficult to keep up. As long as it keeps me moving I guess I am good with it.
1,Extremely misleading Title,"I love international folklore and legends. This book, however, was unable to hold my interest. Too many references to things I don't yet know about Korea and very poor ""readability"" made reading a chore. This is neither ""legend"" nor ""history"" -- if this was the only book I owned about Korea, I might think there IS no ""culture"" in Korea, and they have no ""history."" I purchased this book specifically because it looked like it MIGHT be closer to ""source"" material than the usual translations. The lack of organization, the poor English, and the lack of consistency within the book itself make this virtually useless for my needs.I am not likely to purchase any further books written/translated by this author."
2,Did not like,"Compared to other gambling stories, I thought this one was unorganized, unintersting, and just under done. Not too much fun to read and gets boring trying to listen to a guy show off."
3,Memoirs of an average player.,"This is a sad poker book. (I have not read the Stu Ungar bio which must be even more poignant.) He gives a lot of the gritty details of his poker play. Don't get me wrong: the tone isn't sad, but the game play is.In fact, he admits he never does very well at the tables, and I can't tell if that's due to bad beats or his own bad play.Instead, try the Moneymaker book which at least has an upbeat poker ending or Aces and Kings, about several well-known players.Or read Positively Fifth Street by James McManus about his adventures in the WSOP Main Event. It's not just upbeat; you can tell he understands the game.P.S. Sparks has a new book out, Getting Lucky: the Education of a Mad Poker Player. In it, the author admits his game needed help when wrote this book. (As he was coached by Tom McEvoy before he wrote his new book, I'm sure his game has become much better!) For those who think I was too harsh with Mr. Sparks, I did buy his new book."
1,Beyond A Joke,"Dreadful wannabe action movie attempts every cliché hurdle and falls every time. Only partially relieved by several unintentionally hilarious set pieces... the toilet elevator kidnap, the (completely unerotic) sex scene featuring Peter Weller's socks, the wet-towel-on-head ploy and the HUGE amount of noise made by our heroes as they attempt to sneak through the air ducts. Oh I forgot the laser beam/pocket mirror scene!Oh, and the Pentagon Chiefs of Staff/NSA - the least believable casting ever. Check out the guy with the suit three sizes too big ...Poor Tom Berenger. They can't have shown him the complete script."
2,An terrorist movie with a dumb twist at the end!!Rent it 1st,This movie is a OK terrorist movie with a dumb plot twist at the end!!Even the DVD for this movie is pathetic!!Rent it first!! The DVD has no captions or extra features !! if you are fans of the any of this movies stars I'd say to rent this DVD first before you buy it!!
3,Not very bright....,"These lights are very stylish, however, they aren't as bright as I had hoped they would be. If you are looking for something that just looks good, you will like these. If you want something that will actually illuminate a path or area, you might want to think twice."
3,MALIBU SOLAR,LIGHTS LOOK GOOD BUT THE MAJOR DRAWBACK IS THAT THEY DO NOT LAST THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND CUT OFF B4 ANY OF THE OTHER MANUFACTURERS SOLAR LIGHTS THAT I OWN. WOULD NOT BUY THEM AGAIN BECAUSE OF POOR PERFORMANCE IN LONGEVITY. I HAVE PURCHASED CHEAPER SOLAR LIGHTS THAT OUTPREFORM THEESE. WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER MALIBU PRODUCT
5,Na Leo Captures spirit of contemporary Hawai'i,"Memorable melodies and the sweet sound of Na Leo brighten my day. If you are looking for music that will sooth the spirit and energize the mind, this is a great CD. I find myself humming this music all day, and the songs in Hawaiian are so beautiful that it makes me want to learn the language. This is the best CD purchase I've made in the last 2 years."
2,Miss Leading,"I just received the tetherball set. I was very disappointed with the tetherball. It was not the same one as in the picture. It is a very cheap ball with a cheap rope. If you are going to sell this product, you need to change the picture to represent the ball that comes with the set."
5,Publishers Weekly,"""Hribal slides the emotional fabric of America under a literary microscope to reveal the lies, betrayals, and yearnings that connect and divide us all, giving his stories extraordinary power. He establishes an American landscape in the tradition of Cheever and Updike, though his is a world not of cocktail parties but of trailer parks, bars, and courtrooms. The subtle power of these stories will leave the reader hungry for more.""--Publishers Weekly (starred review)"
1,appalingly awful video documentary,"this video is a collection of uninspired tourist snaps with terrible image quality (high definition is mentioned on the cover, I think not); it is an effort to make a boringdocumentary about such a fascinating country, but yes, this is it! no more!"
4,A terrific guide to leading and managing others!,"Most leadership books tell you how you should lead...without giving you the tools. This book is an exception. Meyer, Houze and Slechta tell you exactly what to do and when...without guesswork. Their concepts aren't theories...they've applied them in real-world situations and circumstances.I suppose what impressed me most is the idea of a Servant's Heart - putting your team members and their well-being ahead of personal or organizational profit. If more American business leaders had a Servant's Heart, we wouldn't have to deal with apathy and indifference in the workplace. Bridging the Leadership Gap is an extraordinary book."
5,I finally passed!,"I only had one day left to study for my exam, again. I thought that I had another month, but when I called and found out that I only had one day to prepare for this test that I failed using the other two exam cram books, I pulled out this handy little treat. I believe the other books were very thorough, but had too much info for my brain to absorb. I went through all the questions one time and reviewed the ones I missed one more time and had the shock of my life when I finally passed. Thank God, I finally made it!"
1,Waste of your money and time,This book has alot of errors and not one of these questions are on the A+ test. If you think that you can just study from this booklet and pass your in for a wake-up call. Don't waste your money on this book. It is better used as a door stop or as toilet paper than a A+ exam cram study guide.
5,top-notch,"I've been waiting for this release for a long time. I can recommend it to every Outer Limits fan, it's worth every penny.Although, I would have expected more special features.It also contains proper subtitles (not just closed captioned) English and French and my favourite episode the Conversion with Rebecca De Mornay.I just hope season 2 is comming soon."
3,yikes!,"This is real Bush era socially conservative moralizing masquerading as science fiction. The over all gist of this first season is that no good can come of science, scientists play god, no good can come of space exploration or contact with other intelligent life, and religion is man's only hope. Real fear based stuff. There are a few notable exceptions like I-Robot. But all in all it's still entertaining, even if it's second rate sci-fi."
3,Complex Relationship,"I found this story to be full of a very complex, and intricate relationship. It was not the typical Interracial story. If you are looking for more than the typical, this book is definitely for you."
4,Have Your Cake and Kim Him Too:A Blackbird Sisters Mystery,This is a wonderful no thinking way to spend the afternoon read. Funny story about 3 sisters and how they are different but are the same. One for all and All for one. The story is enjoyable and the series of the Blackbird Sisters has been a wonderful fine to enjoy and can wait for the next book to be out. Total way to escape and have a good read.
2,Poor engineering,"First let me say that overall this is a very user friendly piece of equipment and works very well. However, when we tried to use the appropriate attachment to fit the IPOD Nano it would not line up to the connector. This means that in order to connect the IPOD it has not support to keep it secure. This becomes an issue when you want to use menu options and put pressure on the IPOD. Very dissappointing to sold something like this."
4,Excelent FM transmitter!!!,"I have tried several FM transmitters for my iPods and none has worked as well as this one. Although sound quality is not as good as if connected through, say, RCA cables, it is good enough for my taste.The FM signal works very well. My car has a rear window antenna and worked absolutely fine. Definitely recomend this product!EC"
4,Gets the job done,"We ordered this a few months ago and have been very happy with it. The only problems we have had are not necessarily flaws in the product but things to be aware of nonetheless. The first is that when it is plugged in to the lighter, it pokes out enough that it can be difficult to put the car in park (this is as much a problem with the car's design as anything). The only other problem is that it relies on the ability to find a radio channel where nothing is being broadcast and this can be surprisingly difficult to do in a major metro area! Otherwise, it is easy to use and does its job well."
2,Not for music enthusiasts,"Cool features, but just not ready for prime time. Does not transmit clear or loud enough sound on my factory Ford stereo. Really bummed that I spent the money for this product."
4,Great solution for the car,"This is a very useful gadget because it combines the ability to charge your iPod while driving with being able to listen to your music or audiobook. It is user friendly and connects easily. I do detect more of a ""whooshing"" noise (not really static) than I get on my satellite radio, even though I use a station with no other signal. However, this seems to be only when it is set at a higher volume, and is not enough to negate the benefits.All in all, a very good purchase. Wouldn't be without it."
1,yea.......,"I have yet to find an fm modulated that works in populated areas with more than 2 radio stations...i have bought , and immediatly returned every one (5) which I have tried......finally reverting back to the old cassette tape with a cord set-up. Has anyone who lives in a metropolitan area found an FM modulator that actually works???thanks"
4,Not Bad!,"This product isn't too bad, it doesnt work in some places because of other receptions...like i said, not bad."
2,I returned it...,This product did not work very well for me. I live in a large metropolitan area (Houston) and there is no dead air and this product needs an empty radio station to work properly. Any loud treble comes out as static if you turn up the volume. I returned this and got the Monster one that works through the tape deck and it works great and sounds great all the time.
1,iPod RoadTrip - NOT!,"I only had this RoadTrip one day and it worked for twenty minutes and then nothing. Also, too awkward to manuever while driving. I returned the RoadTrip and purchased Belkin's Tune Base FM. Though it cost $10 more, it is worth it. I haven't had one bit of trouble, plus the flexible steel neck makes using while driving a breeze."
1,BAD packaging - looks used!,"I got this for my little sister for Christmas as she requested, and boy - was I disappointed in how they arrived! In a plastic bag with a crumped cardboard instruction sheet. SOOOO Disappointing! If this wasn't used, it sure looked like an open box set. I couldn't be more upset. Especially since this arrived only days before Christmas and I had no recourse but to give it to her. She likes it, but said it definitely was NOT in the original packaging - since she got one off the manufacturer's website that came in a box (and for less money than I paid). I highly recommend against purchasing this as I did!!! Bad purchase on my part. I've learned my lesson."
2,Didn't work for me,"I am surprised to see so many positive reviews on this product but for some reason it just didn't work for me and even the design was very bulky and I couldn't figure out a way to mount it in my car.I drive a honda accord and my plug resides right beside the gear stick. I had a very hard time in installing this device and finding the right way to mount it so that it does not obstruct the gearshift.I encountered a very strange problem in finding the right frequency. The device works fine in the morning hours where I could play my ipod at 85.1. But during evening, though I was able to find many unused frequencies, the transmitter just wouldn't work. I got a lot of static which was unbearable and I had to finally return the product."
1,It doesn't work for me,"The item looks sharp, particularly with it matching the white Ipod. As far as it actually working, it falls way short.I live in the NY Metro area and went through all the FM stations and found not one station that the worked with the FM transmitter. Even the stations that had static did not work. My old ""cheaper"" FM transmitter w/charger and cradle with only 4 preset stations worksI don't know whether the Griffin is not working due to the area or the product. Did anyone else have the same experience? What do I do?"
4,Great product,"Hi,its really very good product. I bought couple of days before and works very very good. In cities like NY because of so many fm channel sometimes it create some noise but the facilities given in this product to change channel really helpful...just change the frequency and you all set again...I'll recommand this product.."
2,OK for the price,"This product is OK for the price. It doesn't stay well when using the extension arm to hold an iPod Classic. It slips because of the weight, i.e. the cig. lighter insert isn't tight enough."
3,It's an OK product,This transmitter is ok. Since the music comes via radio waves you get radio quality sound. I wish my car had a mp3 plug but in the meantime this transmitter will work.
4,"good product, perfect condition","This isn't the best technology out there anymore, but it's certainly a great product for the price ($7 plus shipping when I ordered it). All pieces arrived perfectly packaged, all completely functional."
2,"it is barely ""just ok""","Arrived promptly in the original packaging...that was totally crushed. This thing does not charge nano while in use, be forewarned. It is big and bulky, far more so than many on the market. And lastly, the sound quality is not spectacular. Lots of static. Spend the extra $15."
2,DUH!,"I'm sure that this is me, but I am still trying to figure this darn thing out! It sounded so simple when I ordered it---just plug in and download your cassettes to your computer then to your Ipod or CD. For me it's just not happening! I will take another day and give the directions more time. I'm sure that it is something simple that I'm not doing right."
5,Best Transmitter for Your Money!,"This is by far the best transmitter I have ever used! I initially used the transmitter with my best friend whenever we drove around in her car. We have driven all over Illinois and have never had any issues with it; since the dock sits right next to the radio, there is little to no static at all. I originally used a Griffin transmitter cable that worked well but not as well. Despite this item's low price, this is by far the best transmitter that I have ever used and I have used many. You will not be disappointed with this item trust me!"
3,Adequate but not perfect,"Overall, it's very easy to use and well constructed. Two major downsides: first, the joins of the connectors are a puzzle to arrange into the desired angles. It took me several tries and about ten minutes to find a good position for mine given the placement of my cigarette lighter in my car. They're also a bit loose and tend to slip around.Second, the volume is a problem. I never turn my radio past about 40% volume normally, but if I'm listening to spoken word content on my iPod with this thing, I can sometimes have my radio at 100% and not be able to hear softly-spoken words.So it's not great, but it's cheap and overall easy to use."
4,I love it,"i really like this item. I already own a different Griffin Itrip FM transmitter, and it was very staticky and had poor sound quality. I live in a rural area, so we don't have very good radio reception most of the time, and the Griffin Technology 4030-ROAD RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger that I just bought sounds way better. I love it. I has some static in some areas, but it has overall had a very good sound quality."
3,Does NOT charge my 3G,"The product description states that this unit will charge a 3G, but it does not. Also, a good bump will knock the connection loose. However, the sound quality is much better than the wireless transmitter I was using previously and that, for me, is worth the price. It gets only 3 stars for not delivering all the features it advertised for my 3G."
2,Low quality transmission,I have been unable to find a single FM channel in the Tucson metro area that would provide interference-free transmission with this product. The result was a hissing background noise superimposed on the music. I consider this product to be worthless unless you have access to a broad band of inactive FM channels.
1,A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!!,"Okay, if you're someone like me, you want to play your music with cd- quality sound- meaning you don't want to be cringing everytime you go somewhere where reception starts to go sour. I mean, everytime I passed through mountains, or hills ( which were not even that big- I mean, I DO live in L.A. not some remote island), the static started creeping back again). It was so frustrating to have something that finally plays what you want, but to stll not be able to hear it with 100% satisfaction. I returned it the same day I bought it. Hopefully, Apple will acknowledge this problem and come up with some kind of device that fixes it. I'm not wasting my time again with fm transmitters."
1,Griffin Technology 4030-ROAD RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger and Cradle for iPod,"This product was disappointing in that it is very bulky in the car and does not fit well. It is hard to position in it, hard to see the ipod screen no matter how it is positioned.The transmitter itself works good, the music transmits great, but the design of the product is poor. I would not recommend it."
3,"Good, but a tape deck is much better","As fm transmitters go, this is a good one. However, it can't be used with an iPod in a case, which is annoying, and since it is an fm transmitter, the sound quality is not always great. If you have a tape player in your car, you are much better off getting a tape deck converter. It is more versatile, works with the ipod in the case, provides better quality sound, and is much cheaper."
3,Eh - it gets the job done but is overpriced,"The roadtrip is clunky and ugly, but works well for the most part. I set it to 88.1 fm, which is an empty station for me, and the ipod plays clearly through it about 80% of the time. I sometimes get interference when I am around a lot of other vehicles, but it doesn't last long. Also, the LED sometimes flickers between red and green and I have no idea what this means.Overall, I think the roadtrip isn't a good enough solution for the price they're asking and wish I had waited for more peripherals to be made for the video ipod before purchasing it. For $80, I would have liked the roadtrip to be a little sleeker, have labeled controls and support my ipod's clear plastic hardshell case."
2,"May be okay, but it didn't work well for me","This worked, but the sound quality was very disappointing. There was background noise on every frequency I tried.A friend hooked up their Transpod in my car and it was world's better...gonna invest in that, I think."
2,Low Quality,"Ive had my Roadtrip for 6 months now, and I loved it for the time it worked. But then it mysteriously stopped transmitting a signal one day, and there seems to be no way to fix it. The thing is poorly manufactured, and for the price you are better off getting an itrip or a cheaper 3rd party radio transmitter."
4,Good but...,"... weather and electrical cables *are* going to interfere with the sound coming out of the radio.Very nice otherwise, especially the flexible arm."
4,4 out of 5 stars!,This is GREAT little gadget! I use it all the time in my car. Never any static or anything. Sounds just like I popped a CD in there. The ONLY issue I have is that my iPod cannot remain in its case while being played on the RoadTrip. It can be a pain to take it out of its case and put it back in when I want to take it out of the car.
1,"Warning, my ipod stopped working not too long after using it with this device","I had about two good weeks of using this adapter in my car. I used it with an auxillary channel in my sound system and the quality was superb. Then, all of a sudden, my Ipod stopped working after undocking from this device. I strongly suspect that this adapter may have been the culprit. Obviously more than one instance is needed to establish a pattern, so I would be curious if this has occured to any other users as well."
1,"Item was supposed to be new, but came in an old beat-up box.","Would not buy from again! This item was supposed to be a Christmas present, it arrived in an old beat-up box that looked like it had been opened."
3,As long as you stay in town.,"Frankly, I wanted this for road tripping, mostly within a few hours of where I am now, but occasionally across country, and that's not working so well. Maybe I just need to become more facile with locating new open stations and changing it, but as a newbie, I'm finding this a bit of a pain. When I just use it around my own town, it's great, but . . . ."
2,Already broken,I was very pleased with this product for the first couple of weeks. It got great reception and I had very little trouble with static. After about the 3rd week the screw came loose on the adaptor. Now it turns off all the time without even touching it. It is very frustrating while driving! I would not recommend this product.
2,Not again for an ipod touch,"I bought this for my boyfriend to use with his ipod touch (3rd generation I believe). He was really excited to finally have one, but right out of the box it wasn't living up to its potential. The sound quality was pretty good, but everytime he hit a bump or took a turn the ipod would fall out of the docking station and onto the floor. I can't manage to contact the seller to try to return it, but luckily it was only $18! Now looking into another car charger/adapter, my mom has one just like it and loves it! Great reviews too!! [...]"
4,"Good Price, Good Product","For the price, this is a pretty good deal.I wanted an iPod dock for the long drives between college and home. My car doesn't have an iPod plug-in so the AC adapter works perfectly in my car. The Griffin is compatible with my 3rd generation iPod Nano (the little square one).It is a little bulky and awkward but sit and tinker with it and it's pretty easy to get it situated in a place where you can control it without interfering with your driving. I haven't had any problems finding stations to listen to and the sound quality seems great to me. A little fuzziness here and there but usually that's a sign that the iPod isn't fully connected.A definite buy; works great for me so I'm really happy with it, especially when it was SO cheap!"
2,Transmits fine but doesn't recharge iPod 3G,"Just bought this for the car. It seems to transmit fine over the radio, akin to other MP3 player FM transmitters I have used in the past. Minimal static/noise and good signal transmission. Controls are easy to use and intuitive. However, the iPod 3G gives an error message saying the device does not support recharging. I will return it since that was a crucial function and main reason I purchased this item. Otherwise would give 5 stars."
3,"Nice product, but....","When I tried to use it in Sacrmaneto, there was only one place on my radio that was static enough to point my RoadTrip to. And then I started to get a station as I was driving around. Would probably work quite well if you're driving in the desert."
3,How does it work in a Vauxhall ?,"Bought a Roadtrip & use it with a Video Ipod, works fine in a Fiat & Citroen but I cannot get it to work in a Vauxhall ? Any body else had this problem - or more importantly managed to resolve this problem ?"
3,help,The item came very quickly and I have no complaints with that at all. I am told that I paid a great price for it and I am very happy with that as well. I just can't seem to get it to work. I try to plug it into the cigarette lighter but I don't know if it is going in all the way because it won't seem to power on. Can you e-mail me or something to help me to figure this out? Thank You
2,hmmm,good product what makes it bad is that radio waves interferes with it making the music transmission from the ipod not so clear. The transmitter is a bit bulcky.
5,"Perfect, Practical, Necessary Enhancement for iPod","I LOVE the Griffin Technology 4030-ROAD RoadTrip FM Transmitter & Auto Charger and Cradle for iPod. It makes my iPod even more convenient and usable. It's great that it's charging while I'm listening to it. It's easy to plug in, and it's also easy to unplug and hide away. I'm very happy with this purchase. It was a wonderful investment."
2,"Better than Nothing, but not much","I am disappointed in the quality of the sound. I have used it in two different cars. One has an average radio, the other a Bose radio. Neither car sounds very good. There is distortion from the signal if you turn the volume to an inspiring level. If quality of sound is important, do not buy this. The transmitter is simply not strong enough.I am not satisfied and regret spending the money for it."
3,Works great however....,"A wire was loose inside the power port extension. It had to be resoldered. Once fixed, the item works great."
4,Not bad!,"The only reason I didn't give this item a 5 star is that its a bit on the bulky side. As for the good qualities: I get excellent reception, even driving downtown in a busy city. It was easy to set up, and there are enough ""adaptors"" to accomodate all the different iPods out there. I have the video 30G and it fits snuggly and securely without any jiggling on bumpy roads. I only wish it came in black to match my cool black iPod! Oh..and I'm bummed its on sale right now too! Oh well."
2,Not a good product for ipod nano in a case!!,"I purchased this product and promptly returned for the following reasons:1. The only way my nano would fit in this product is by taking it out of its iskin which is not fun to do and totally defeats the purpose of protection.2. I have a Jeep Liberty and where the cigarette lighter is in my car prevented me from being able to use the RoadTrip and putting my vehicle in Park!! Even with the extending arm it was still awkward.I ended up purchasing a Belkin tuneFM which just came out a couple of weeks ago...it seems good so far and is very user friendly as well as compatible with an iskin or case that has an opening at the bottom for the USB and headset jacks. Also, this product does come with a car charger so that you have the option of charging your ipod nano when necessary!!This product seemed like a good idea since it charges it and holds the unit all in one but it just wasn't compatible with my set-up."
2,Low Pitch Hum Unbearable,"I have two major beefs with my unit, which I've had for about 7 months:1) About 60% of the time, there is a low-pitch hum that occurs independent of the frequency, ipod being used, or vehicle being used. The noise makes my music unlistenable. The noise is accompanied by the frequency display flickering.2) As the unit has aged, the support arm and all of the pivot points have become loose and the thing flops all over the place.I have sent an inquiry to Griffin support and have not heard back yet (only been a day or so). When the unit works, the sound is as good as expected for FM. But I only get it 40% of the time!"
5,Amazing piece of equipment,I love this item...i have sirius installed in my vehicle which also utilizes an fm transmitter and you have to install this amplifier cable to make it clear...even with that installed this unit will overpower it when its one and come through clear as day. I would reccomend to an ipod owner
2,i got a used one???,"I got this Roadtrip system with a pretty decent price, however, this again is a lesson learned that do NOT trust something with a price out of market range. If it's too good to be true, it's not true. First impression on it is it's definitely not a new one. With a crappy box and stained product, i think it must be a refurbished product which did NOT note or mark anywhere in the description. Instead, it marked ""new"". Haven't got a chance to test drive it yet, i hope it won't let me down again with its quality."
2,Not Well Made,"I did not buy this from Amazon. I needed both arms because of the way the interior of my car was set up. After being used for about a month or so one of the plastic screws holding an arm in place worked loose. I tightened it. Vibration from the car caused it to need tightening every few days. Finally, I lost the screw when I didn't tighten it soon enough and could not obtain a replacement.It was my first FM transmitter and I paid considerably more than the current Amazon price. In fact, the current Amazon price is a lot closer to the actual worth though still overpriced in my opinion. Look for a better manufactured item."
2,"Useful, but Narrow","There are other places for the information in this book. I was disappointed and would recommend other references over this one. More detailed information in softener operation, RO operation, etc. would make this book a definite plus. I won't call it useless, but, it could be improved. Handbooks should provide detailed information in a ready format. On a few occassions, I found water treatment data in this book. But, not in any depth. I found myself going to vendor data which defeats the purpose of a handbook. Also, detailed worked out examples would be highly useful in the next edition. Needs improvement."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR ANY BEATLES FAN!!!!!!,"We bought this for our granddaughter, she's 13, for Christmas because she's such a BEATLE""S FAN and she loved it!!!! We borrowed it from her after she finished reading it so we could enjoy it too. We loved it too!!!!!!!!"
5,Belle and the Beau,Excellent young adult novel for an introduction into historical fiction. I have read all of Beverly Jenkins books. I would recommend this book for teens ages 15 - adults. Just enough history intertwined with fiction for fast enjoyble reading.
2,Unrealistic,"I know, its just a book for teenage girls who love romance. Thats great. but the problme is the language the setting were very unrealistic. I felt that the historical setting and the characterizations were very poor to say the least. If details are something you notice in a book, then I would avoid this one.However if you just want another cutsy love story and care nothing for the acuuracy of a historical setting. Then enjoy it. I just can't. And becaue of it, I didn't buy the nest in the series either."
3,Another good Aussie artist,"I cannot quite put my finger on it, but this album feels ""retro"" somehow. My favorite songs are Feeler and So Beautiful (the latter is absolutely *haunting*), which I have on my ""moody"" playlist. This album is best in a shuffle with at least 5 albums; for some reason, Pete's voice and style can wear on a person, so is best interspersed with other songs.Zach Braff will probably put ""So Beautiful"" on the soundtrack of one of his next movies. MAN, that guy can pick good music!!!"
2,telltail timer,"I have had several West bend clock/timers over the years, all functioned well and had a fairly loud ringer alerting you of the times end. I purchased two new ones and am quite disappointed in the alarm sound alone, which is barely audible, making it almost useless when you can't hear it from across the room. I called the manufacturer and was prompted to replace the battery, which the customer support rep said was cheap, I did just that with an alkaline one and it made no difference."
1,It Did Not Work!,The product came half way taped to the package and was broken and did NOT work!...a big waste of time and money!
4,"So far, so good","I have been struggling with the my ol' faithful 15-year old West Bend timer for a while now. I bought a Pyrex, but it lasted barely 2 years and I never was really happy with it. Now I have the ""new"" West Bend model (why do things have to change???) and am happy with it so far, although I've only used it a dozen times or so. I like that it's a triple timer, but what I really missed in the Pyrex was the memory function (""did I bake those cookies for 6 minutes? Or 8?"", no matter how many times I told myself that I would remember...). There is a different ""beep"" to indicate which is Timer #1, #2, etc. and they are nice, loud signals. I also like that the battery is not one of those expensive ""button"" batteries (as the Pyrex one was).As for durability, I am careful to the point of fussiness with my equipment, be it my LeCruiset baker or a little ol' timer, so it doesn't stand up then it really isn't worth it. Time will tell, and I will revise this review if necessary."
3,"""New & Improved?""","Like others who have the West Bend 3 channel, I am disappointed that the new electronic version is not nearly as good as the older model. The ring is not as loud and it's harder to set. And, it won't sit on a counter without moving around. Why do companies ""improve"" something that was good already?"
2,West Bend 40053 timer review,This item has a really annoying tone to its beep especially for someone who awakes easily. It doesn't work as easily as the older model I had. I don't recommend it at all.
4,"Perfect for the kitchen, not for studying.","It is pretty loud, which is expected of a kitchen timer. However, I would not recommend using it for studying (I used it to study 25 minutes and break for 5.) I removed the speaker, but it just didn't work out for me and I stopped using it. I recommend it if you need a loud timer for kitchen use or other time essential applications. Buttons are decent, the stand works perfectly, and adjusting it is easy. Clock feature is pretty useless, but a nice touch I suppose."
3,A non improvement on a good timer,"The model that this one replaces was alot better. It gave three distinct beeps for the three timers. It was simpler to use, and sat nicely on the counter. This one adds a clock-I think most kitchens already have one-and a stop watch that may come in handy. It tips over when you press the buttons, because of the narrow magnet assembly protruding from the back, ironically making it useless as a magnetic timer, and requiring two hands to set. They should have left the design as it was, it was alot better. Edit: less than two years later, the buttons are sticking, not working right. Not very kitchen-hardy. Take off another star."
2,"Good Features, Bad Construction","I have had two of these timers; the features are great, but each stopped working in less than a year. Too bad that the quality does not keep up with the design."
1,West Bend Triple Timer,"I used a West Bend Triple timer for about 25 years and was well satisfied with it. It had a loud alarm. The new model has a clock (not very useful), a stop watch function (moderately useful) and a triple timer function (fairly useful). Unfortunately the timer functions are more difficult to set than on the older unit. The alarm is very weak, very difficult for me to hear. I am looking for another alarm."
3,West Bend 40032 Still Available,"I don't have the 40053 so my rating is obviously not relevant. However, since I've seen complaints about the 40032 no longer being available through West Bend, some readers might be interested in knowing that it is available through another source:http://www.daigger.com/catalog/product/d-Lab+Timers/Lab+Timers/p-4115/10-hour+Triple+Program+Lab+TimerLooks identical to my West Bend one except for the name (and it also looks to be less expensive)."
1,OVERPRICED,This item is NOT as good as West Bends old style triple timer....which I loved....and wore out....the buttons are too small and too close together.....and I saw the SAME item AFTER I made my purchase at Wal-Mart for less than 10.00.....one third of the price....I am very disappointed.....
3,Triple Timer from West Bend,"I was disappointed that the item was not ""Made in USA"" as originally noted on description, but timer functions well. Signal is nice and loud. I like that it counts forward from the time signal sounds. It would be the perfect timer if it had a way to program time without pushing hour/minute/second button repeatedly to get to desired time set. This means you have to pust minute button 50 times if you want 50 minutes. That is a bit tedious, but manageable."
1,Timer beeper has completely stopped functioning,"This timer was bought to replace a West Bend timer we had for more than 10 years and had ceased functioning. The new timer was harder to use as the writing was very small on the function buttons. It worked well until one week ago, it no longer beeps. We changed the battery and the beeper still does not function. The timer shows the time but makes no beep to alert the user. We are very disappointed. Can the item be replaced? A response would very much be appreciated. Thank you, Linda"
1,Flimsy and Annoying,The magnet on the back is made cheaply; it broke very soon after purchase. The timer beepers are so very annoying I just replaced it with a different brand.
2,Magnet is too weak - Fell down and broke,"This is my 3rd WestBend timer, the other 2 lasted for 6 or 7 years before the speaker gave out and they stopped beeping - still work, just no sound. This one needs a stronger magnet, it's hit the floor twice and now the start button doesn't work for the timers. It was very nice while it lasted, it has 3 timers with 3 different sounds so you know which one has gone off, but the magnet is much weaker than the old one. I'm going to get another one and replace the magnet with a much stronger one so that it doesn't hit the floor so often and will continue working. I'll keep this one as an extra clock."
2,too hard to set,"This is a nice timer, BUT it only has forward time set. So if you want, for example 30 min, but accidently go past 30 you have to go all the way around to get back to 30.Other timers I've used have both forward and back buttons to set it."
4,West Bend Triple Timer,"It's a new model of their old favorite, and it works much better! I haven't made up my mind on the usefullness of the magnet, but I'll know more later. The stand-up feature is nice - it was missing on the old one. And one battery is better than two."
2,clip broke,I ordered these for doctors office that needs to time different things. We like the triple function but found that the clips broke the first day we used them.
4,This timer works ... but...,"This is the 3rd one of these timers I have purchased over the years. They are great; but this latest one has one irritating feature. The alarm ""beep"" is now of a much higher frequency than the previous timers we've had. And, for one with a high frequency hearing loss, it creates a problem. Before, I could hear the beep from across the house; now I have to be near the timer. Oh, well..."
5,Great timer!,"This timer replaces a West Bend timer almost like this that I have used for about 20 years. These electronic timers are great! I use it in the kitchen to time baking, cooking etc.as well as many other times we want to time something. The timer on the stove gives just one ""bing"" so it is easy to not hear it, especially if you are no longer in the kitchen. This West Bend timer sounds the alarm for several minutes - till you turn it off.It has three timers -- so my husband can be timing the sprinkler, and I can be timing both the meat on the grill and the bread in the oven. The bell is distinctive for each timer, so you can easily tell which item is done. I had to go for several weeks without a timer till I had a chance to order this, and really missed it."
2,West Bend 40053 triple timer,The back fell off and broke after just having it for a few days. The old model was so much better.
1,An alternate,"A copy of the review above.I just got this timer and it IS the same as the old West Bend timer we all came to love!I don't have the 40053 so my rating is obviously not relevant. However, since I've seen complaints about the 40032 no longer being available through West Bend, some readers might be interested in knowing that it is available through another source:[...]"
1,West Bend has a bad design,The West Bend 40053 replaces the 40032 model that had been a superb design. The new model is a poor design and does not meet the most important requirements: Simplicity and Functionality. Do these manufacturers ever ask real people to check out their designs?
2,West Bend...listen to your customers,"Sheesh, West Bend, how about listening to your customers and bring back the old, reliable, well-loved 3 event timer? As you can see it has quite the customer following. I have not found anything that can replace it.The one I bought from CDN (Model PT1A) broke within the first week. The slider would no longer bring up the ""Count Down"" timer function. Of course, the function I use the most.Sometimes basic is best."
1,Don't waste your money,"I also had the old reliable 3-button West Bend triple timer for at least 20 years. When it finally quit, the only one I could find was Model 40053. Seemed to work OK, so got another of the same model for Xmas 2008. The newest one beeps so softly I can hardly hear it. The older 40053 beeped quite loudly. The first replacement quit working last week. It was not even 2 years old. I put in a new battery, but nope. Just like a previous post, clock works, but NONE of the timers, which is of course why we purchase timers. Not buying any more of these."
1,Junk,"It stopped working after only 3 weeks. It worked two times and failed on the third. In addition, the buttons are hard to read."
4,great timer but too many zeros,"My wife and I loved the old West BEnd timer so when it broke we wanted to replace it. This new one is fine, but it displays leading zeros (to the left of the nonzero numerals), which makes it difficult to read quickly. Bad human engineering."
3,Westbend 3 timer,"I purchased this when my old style Westbend 3 timer went out. This one is fine. It does NOT stand well on a counter top. Why, it has a clip in the back that gets in the way. dumb design. It has more functions that just get in the way on the timers. So yes it does the job. Westbend went too far with features and made a great timer just an OK one. Would I buy this one again, Yes, it's the best in class/price. Westbend, get rid of the clip in back and make it stand like the old one and get rid of the clock and count up features. The old one worked and it stood on the counter. The clip in the back is over kill. Westbend should have just kept making the old one. They would sell more."
1,"Poor quality, poor design","It chirps like a baby chick which is OK if you have super hearing.The extra O at the left in the hour display is constantly on and a distraction.Would not keep this product if free.And, why do you send me an email to review this product and then require me to sign in with my email address to review it? And then would use my real name unless I change it. I will not do another review for Amazon ever."
3,Good but...,"The timer is great... However, the hinge on the magnetic clip is plastic & broke within the 1st week of use. I'm in the process of exchanging it so ... we'll see."
4,Instructions for Battery Insertion/Changing,"I have had the plain vanilla timer for ages and love it. With the holidays coming up, requiring multiple tasks, I decided to get this one. I am 'battery challenged'. Instructions that came with it are NOT very helpful. So, if any other lil ole lady is having a problem getting the battery in place or is trying to change the battery, here is how it works: on the back of the timer, pull up on the magnet gizmo until the little metal clip locks into place; at the bottom of the back there is the obvious bulge where the battery goes; PRESS DOWN HARD with your thumb on the three little upraised indentations and slide the cover downward; the battery cover SHOULD slide right down. The other instructions that came with it are fairly clear.Good luck, and happy cooking..."
3,Intuit backs down,"I guess Intuit got enough complaints on product activation, as they sent me the following:Dear Valued Customer:In response to your comments on the implementation of product activation technology in tax year 2002 TurboTax(R) software, I wanted to let you know that Intuit will discontinue product activation in next year's TurboTax desktop products purchased at retail or direct from Intuit.We are absolutely committed to listening and learning from our customers. We clearly need to better understand all of our customers' tax preparation needs and how they use TurboTax.While we remain committed to protecting our intellectual property, going forward, we will only introduce digital rights management technologies that maximize customer experience and preserve customer satisfaction.Again, thanks for your feedback.Regards,Tom Allanson, Sr. Vice PresidentTurboTax"
2,What does Premier Stand For?,"Just found out that TurboTax Premier Home & Business does not support the filing of the required 1120S form. The product leads you to believe it can support S-Corporations in its help features but only appears to support K-1 forms. After paying for TurboTax products from their inception, I'am going to look elsewhere as this company has no clue as to delivering the positive customer experience. TurboTax recommends that one buy both their Individual (Home) and their Business versions to support an S Corporation. Now since I'm not a limited partner or LLC, I don't know if those features work in their Premier Home and Business version.... Premier sounds like an opening of a new movie in which you may be in for something you didn't expect."
1,Use to be good,"I've used TurboTax for at least 3 years. I've been relatively pleased in past years. This year they have done a very poor job with the product.I found a blatent bug in their Web product that was miscalculating a basic number regarding mortgage interest, which I suspect had something to do with the Schedule C information.Their tech support could not even support the Web product. They could not help me in the least bit. Incidentally, getting tech support was a joke! There were no free options. I couldn't even look at a knowledge base."
1,TurboTax does not work. Intuit does not know why.,"TurboTax will not load on many computers according to Intuit. An error code appears when trying to get an activation code or the request code is missing during their new activation process. When you call their support line they say they do not have a fix for the problem and do not plan on having it fixed until February. The customer can not load the software. Good job Inuit. Greed has gone to your head and now you've created a product that doesn't work. Our advice to Intuit customers, if you want to spend your money on a product that just does not work then feel free. Otherwise save your money."
1,"Used to use Turbo-Tax, but now it's too Dangerous","I've been using Turbo-Tax Home & Business in the past,but changes to the program for 2002 render it toodangerous to continue its use for myself and mostothers.If you ever need to file an amended return and you'veput in a new hard drive or replaced your computer, youcan't do it. They now require on-line or telephone activationand the activation is locked to the PC it's installed on.I routinely need to do amended returns a year or two downthe road, and it is entirely possible that I will havechanged computers by then.Intuit will get no more of my money. I'm switching fromTurbo-Tax to Kiplinger's Tax Cut, and from Quicken toMicrosoft Money."
1,Think twice before buying Turbotax,I'm unable to use Turbotax due to limitation to number of forms of W2G it allows. The limit is 30. Talked to customer support there and all they told me is to return the software. Now I have to buy the TaxCut (it supports 250 copies of any form) and retype all the information. I strongly advice you not to buy Turbotax - they will do nothing to help you if you hit one of their limitations. They do not care at all that I have been their customer for at least 10 years.
1,Activation nightmare,I have used this product (legally) for over 10 years. The product activation software that is installed on your personal computer stays resident in your computer's memory all the time even when you are not using TurboTax. This is simply obscene and unacceptable. I returned my copy and bought H&R Block's Tax Cut software. My data from last year's Turbotax return was installed easily and quickly. Tax Cut has been an easy transition and they have no activation/spy ware programs that stay active.Note that TurboTax's web site still does not disclose that their activation software stays resident in your computer's memory. Their failure to disclose this information is unethical. I also believe this utilization of my personal computer by them is unethical. I will not buy TurboTax again.
1,Use TaxCut instead!,"TurboTax has performed well in the past, but this year it has failed to perform at an acceptable level. The new TurboTax requires online activation. It also tries to limit software sharing and in doing so makes file storage, back-up and retrieval difficult. I have been unable to re-open my work because of these protections and have had to start completely over on a long return. TurboTax also seems a bit less user-friendly this year. I have had to abondon TurboTax because of these problems and am now using TaxCut instead.Save a lot of trouble and start with TaxCut instead!"
1,does not cover everything,"Well, turbo tax does not much more than a spread sheet. So far I have three complains:1. If you itemize and get a state refund, it cannot tell you if you should include in your income. Instead, it sends you to IRS web site to download form 525 and do it yourself.2. If you trade stock a lot, the cost base calcualtor froze up before I was half through. I end up using excel to do the cost base calculation and enter the final number in the turbo tax.3. It is worse if you own LU because it spin off AV and AGR. The word ""spinoff"" cannot be found in the topic list. As always, you can go to IRS web site.I am not sure if there are other tax software outthere that is better, I am certainly will NOT buy turbo tax next year."
1,Has gliches,I've used this product for four years. The last two years I've had a problem with downloading my state's tax updates. I always buy the extra state tax software. I try to download the updates from Intuit's web site and it tells me there aren't any updates for my state. When I go back to the program it tells me there are updates to download. It's a never ending cycle and meanwhile I have no idea if the state tax form I send in is accurate or up to date because I always buy the software before the end of Dec 31 and changes are made to it before Apr 15. I've never received a reply from TurboTax/Intuit when inquiring about this gliche either. Also it seems if you use the same software year after year you should be able to get a better deal on the price - sort of like an upgrade. I find it's cheaper to buy this item from just about anywhere than Intuit... Otherwise the software works okay. I'm going to try Kiplinger's this year though.
1,"Intrusive ""Activation"" ala Microsoft! Doesn't uninstall!","I now have to return this product. I ordered before I learned of it's Draconian ""activation"" feature that only allows it to be used on one computer, and IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MOTHERBOARD, ETC, IT STOPS WORKING!So, don't use this if you think you will ever upgrade either your motherboard or your harddrive before the statute of limitations for tax returns runs out (3 years?)!!!!!"
1,Intuit stepped in it,"I had pre-ordered TurboTax premier, knowing that some sort of product activation would be required. I had no idea that this activation would involve third-party software that I could not remove from my computer, short of a low-level format of my hard drive.I am returning TurboTax for a refund, as I still fall within the 60 day return period. I will try TaxCut this year."
1,Product Activation not reliable,After installing Turbo Tax Delux the activation would only workuntil I rebooted the system. After a reboot Turbo Tax wouldtell me that the software is installed on another system and tellme I needed to purchase another license. The only help thatIntuit could do was to instruct me to send the program back to thevendor and get another copy. I went through this cycle 3 timesbefore sending the software back to Intuit for a refund via theremoney back policy. I will never buy this software again and I amglad there competers don't have this product activation bug.
1,Installation Nightmare,"I have been using Turbotax for 10 years, but this year is the worst. The program corrupted my dual-processor Windows 2000 font system during installation. Customer service is (of course) no help. Then after I got the operating system limping along, the registration process (new for this year) locks the program to your computer. They charge you again if you move it to another computer."
1,Go Elsewhere,"After more than 15 years of loyally supporting a great program, and having ordered and paid for the 2002 version last February, Intuit sent me a disk that would not install, on account of its ""Activation"" scheme. Some 10-12 hours later, after dealing with a series of ""techs"" who were clueless, one guy finally told me that, contrary to the advertising, TurboTax will not intall on most machines running W98SE (also problems on W2000 or WXP). TurboTax finally told me I should go elsewhere, and I'm passing that wise advice on to others. Intuit's present attitude toward its customers is not one that makes me want to deal with this Company any longer."
1,I returned my copy,"I bought a copy of Turbotax Home and Business for my desktop PC while I had a new laptop on order. Called Turbotax support (waited forever), they told me I had to purchase 2 licenses - one for the old machine, one for the new laptop (since I was replacing the desktop with the laptop).I returned the software and bought TaxCut for [much] less. So far, it seems to be an outstanding product. The transfer between machines was simple.I appreciate the need for software rights protection, but I refuse to pay double licensing fees to help Intuit fight the bad guys. It was a great 10 years with TurboTax, but now I'm a TaxCut customer."
1,TurboTax Activation Fiasco,"I purchased the TurboTax Home & Business Edition after many years of using other TurboTax products to prepare my taxes. I have had nothing but trouble with it, and haven't been able to activate it after several hours on-line with TurboTax Help and a replacement CD. (This after they decided that the problem was because my first CD was corrupted.) Even the second CD didn't work. At this point I have spent too much time and am just going to return it and get a different program. Too bad they ruined what used to be a good product. They have certainly lost this customer!"
2,"Lots of sex, not much of a story","I was disappointed in this book which I found totally unbelievable, both the story line and the characters. For those who read romances for the sex, and I've read reviews which listed how many pages were devoted to it as well as the page numbers for, I guess those who want to read only those parts, this book will satisfy you. It's short on story however."
2,Not what I had expected,"I was hoping for something more substantial. The authors make a few interesting insights, yet the book lacks a lot, in my opinion. Not much to it."
5,Color from the Earth: The Preparation and Use of Native Ear,I bought this book some years ago and gave it to a friend of mine. I'm looking for another exemplar. Does someone have this book and want to sell it to me? Send information to hvieira@dialdata.com.br Many thanks
4,Jhelisa - Everybody Jump Off,"EVERYBODY JUMP OFF, Jhelisa's unequivocal note the people need to leave her alone, leans into the darker side of acid jazz, a dense and heavy that uses atonal harmonies to good effect. The Stereo MC's clean the track to straight-up funk quite spectacularly, with a groovy bass that loses none of Jhelisa's non-chalant vocals. (Supposedly, this track convinced Madonna to let the Stereo MC's remix her.) The Headrillaz go for big beat breaks, incorporating a sample of a woman who is--quite literally--crazy. So instead of everybody jumping off, when they hear this track, they'll more likely be jumping up."
1,not so good,this seemed like a good idea for when it was bedtime for my puppy until she could be completely housetrained. Or when i went to the store. Well after 3 days my 2 pound Havanese puppy climbed right out of it . Wish they had a top to make sure she couldn't get out. So for me this is a complete waste of money as it does not contain the puppy.
3,Decent product,"This is a decent product that works as described. I would not say this is a high quality product but the quality is reasonable given the low price. For example, the unit's wires are not copper. This is a sign of cost-cutting. The instructions asked me to refer to an included guide that was not included with my product. Also, the product did not have the green wire that allows the installer to eliminate the 20 second delay. This was not a problem for me since I like the 20 second delay. I've since learned there are two similar products, one with the green wire and one without. Installation was quite easy, although I greatly benefited from car-specific instructions I found on-line."
4,Great Little Lap Board,"My daughter wanted a small whiteboard for math practice, drawing, notes, etc. The size is right for working on her lap and since it has a small hole on one end, she is able to hang it up on her door as well. The quality is good but not great, however you can't beat it for the price...perfect for what it is."
4,Its a board,"Its great I wouldn't drag it around anywhere but its great for keeping near my desk. I use it for Calc problems. I would suggest that you get a nice size eraser for it, I have a squeegee style one from Board Dudes. I was surprised that it came with a marker. The marker is nice, it has a fine tip and an eraser on the cap. The ink isn't as dark as the Expo retractable markers I own but its not a poorly made marker by any means. You can't beat the price either."
3,information,"Sorry,still i haven't gone through the book of informix. I am a new user of informix.B'coz of that i want to have a review of the contents in the Informix introduction book.After that i can tell u about the review"
3,Pretty good!,"I made the mistake of buying this for $40 from another site. It's a great item, made to last (though the gold can rub off the edges a bit), and the pewter's also lead-free- another perk.This is one of the best Anubis pendants I've seen, and I've worn mine daily for well over a year and a half now, and it's in relatively good condition. Word of warning- don't drop pink sherbet on it by accident; I can't get the sherbet spill off, so the ankh is pink! ;)"
3,Case of the mummies tomb,This book is hillarious. first they are so stupid to mess with the tomb and then they open it. what retards. But since it was a mystery it kind of left you hanging. Hopefully the author can fix it up sooner or later.
3,Love everything Sharukh Khan does,"Only problem with this DVD, no subtitles for the songs. : Other than that, how can you not love early Shahrukh, especially with the requisite bad Bollywood fight scene!"
1,Horrible,"Like one of the other reviewers I bought this Converter / Adaptor for a trip overseas and it began smoking, overheated and fried itself during the first use. I had done a lot of research on this product to confirm that it would work in the country I was going to be in. Very disappointing since I was going to be there for 3 months."
3,Received to late,Nuetral rating given because item was received past when it was needed. Item was for an overseas trip but did not arrive for the trip even though we felt enough lead time was given and expedited shipping was paid for.
2,Poor Quality,"Creative MuVo MP3 Player have problem playing particular mP3 songs. It plays WMV file songs smoothly. However, it always give a buzz when playing MP3. The voice recorder's quality is acceptable, but it consumes a lot of power when recording. If I were you, I would definitely give a thought on this MP3 player!"
2,Becareful with the N200,"This wonderful player did everything it was said to do until it randomly stopped working about a week and a half after purchase. Finding myself truely disappointed and not having a fix for the problem or even an understanding of what the actual problem was, i returned the product. What suprised me though was that it had many good reviews on Amazon.com, but after looking at the forums on the manufacturer's own website (creative.com), and other forums found through google.com about the N200, i noticed that alot of people had had or were having the same or similar problem and complaints about the N200, especially about the the player turing off on its own and not staying on when it was actually turned on. This product, though excellent in every way when it actually works, needs to be recalled or seriously updated because it simply does't work after a short while. And you can't use things that dont work."
4,Impressive!,"This little MP3 player has a lot of power and features for its size! While there are many brands of MP3 players on the market, I prefer this model of Creative for its compact style and durability. For half-hour workouts in the gym, it is ideal!Creative shines with this product, maintaining its reputation for high quality computer sound. The flash drive has no moving parts, so there is no worry that it will skip or be damaged during an active exercise routine.I would have given it five stars, but the sound buzzes faintly when the display is illuminated. While the faint buzzing lasts only a couple of seconds, I would think a company like Creative could do better.Overall, this player is a good purchase for the money. I have no regrets!"
1,Don't buy this product!,"I have been through two of these units, and neither one operated properly for more than a few hours. I spent hours corresponding with Creative's help desk trying to correct the ""programming error"" on the first unit, and nothing worked. I finally returned it and got a replacement, which also malfunctioned after the first use. Problems varied from not staying powered on, to forward and reverse buttons turning off the unit rather than doing what they are supposed to, and also the memory malfunctioning so that when I turned it off or paused it and turned it back on, it picked up at a totally different location. There are supposedly downloads you can get to correct these errors, but I don't think it's too much to expect a new product to function properly for several months, let alone a few hours!Buy something else!"
2,Defective or just 2X bad luck?,"I love this mp3 player-- it fits everywhere, has a long battery life, reasonable quality audio for recording, efficient with space, very user-friendly, etc.My only problem with this player is that I have had two defective ones. The first player brought me joy and happiness until 2 weeks of living with me, when it would shut off every time it was ready to advance to the next song. That's fine. So I got a replacement.This current one was fine for 10 weeks until it would shut off even before I could fully power it on. This only happens 75% of the time, but that is definitely inconvenient, since I don't know how to prevent the incidences.Aside from my negative experiences, its wonderful versatility is suitable for most activities... providing it works.The problems I'm having are seemingly unrelated, and since I've followed the manual for usage since day-1, I doubt its my fault."
1,Broken after 6 months,"I bought this MP3 player in March to use while working out. Initially, it was great and I found it to be a necessary accessory to my work out. About a month ago the scroll button stopped working so I could no longer skip songs when I wanted to. While this was annoying, I could live with it. This week it stopped working all together. I can press the power button and I see the start up screen and then it just dies. Now I have to go out and buy a new one."
4,Stopped working? Freezing? Not turning on? TRY THIS TO FIX IT!!,"Stopped working? Freezing? Not turning on? TRY THIS TO FIX IT!!Had this for 3 weeks, then stopped working. Returned it and replacement also stopped working after 2 weeks. It either turned off while playing a song, turn itself off after a couple seconds, or wouldn't turn on at all.Perplexed, I looked in the amazon reviews, and a couple reviews suggested updating the FIRMWARE. I did this, and now it WORKS PERFECTLY AGAIN!!(...)thanks!"
2,"Like my girlfriend, cute but dysfunctional","From the moment I received this unit, it became possessed by demons unknown to me. For starters, it would shut down without warning, mid-play; the only way to start it back up would be to take the batteries out and re-insert. The ability to scroll songs failed entirely. Creative Labs directed me to download drivers and other assorted ""fixes"", even though I was running the exact type of computer recommended by Creative that should by all accounts have worked seamlessly with the device. The durability was immediately in question, the serial number (required by Creative to be able to return the bloody thing) mysteriously disappeared during light handling. A total Lemon. Get a Rio! Oh, and one more thing, I have been trying to return it to Creative for about 3 weeks, and apparently no humans work there that I may speak with. An exchange of fruitless emails has resulted in NADA."
4,Great player with one problem,"I just got this, my first mp3 player, yesterday. Sound is great, pretty easy to set up and use, with one problem. I tried for hours last night to get my songs to play in order (a playlist order; they weren't from the same album). Every time, they would be in the correct order on the computer, then when they would transfer to the player they were in alphabetical order. I tried several things and alphabetical order every time. I did an internet search and seems this is a known problem (I didn't know before purchase) and requires more software in order to set up playlists. It costs $15 but works great and so far is worth it. The software and more information is at http://www.redchairsoftware.com/notmad/featmv.php.Overall I'm satisfied so far, but wish I'd known this ahead of time. This may be a problem with other brands, too, as this same site had additional software for iRiver players and others."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is for weak leaders who want to pretend they are actually doing others good by leading with all their weaknesses. Try ""Called to Lead."" instead or even better yet, ""The Way of the Shepherd"" by K. Leman. Leading with a Limp is a waste of time and money and gives false hope to those in leadership who don't belong there in the first place."
3,Not up to Allender standard,"This book is good, but not great. I've read a couple of Allender's books that are much better so i expected great things from this one. The title and sunject matter is intriguing and i wanted so much to read about ""leading with a limp"" from someone who has been through the brokenness process. I sensed instead a tendency towards judgmentalism and arrogance. Maybe my expectations were too high."
3,Mildly Engaging,"Moore manages to create a credible historical setting for this romance, but the characters tend toward the simplistic. Romantic hero Adair seems to fall in love with the heroine a bit too quickly and without sufficient justification within the tale, and for all of her protests, the heroine behaves like a blazing floozy at his very first kiss (before returning to her constant complaints). She saves the day just a shade too often, leaving the hero looking somewhat of a heedless dummy. The story improves as it nears the finish, but somehow, I just didn't think the author's talents or attention were fully engaged on this one."
4,Great,A more entertaining writer you would be hard pressed to find. A climber with a sense of humor and the ability to write stories that will keep you wanting more. I just wish I could find more books by John Long.
4,Good log book,"I really don't have much basis for comparison (my previous log book was a very primitive little booklet), but the pages of this book have entry spaces for just about every piece of information I can think of wanting to log for a given dive. I think the pages are laid out well, and the pages are easy to write on yet durable enough to withstand getting a little wet."
5,put a smile on her face,Bought it as a gift and a smile on her face it was just what she wanted perfect it's amazing just what you need
5,Tis lovely.,"I really liked this diary; I thought it was the best in the series. Runt could have been any moderately bright eleven-year-old kid, though he was rather liberal, making friends of all nationalities. I can't say I was very fond of Runt's brother Blessing, but Runt's uncle was a really nice guy and the Fox was quite cleve. The diary told a very entertaining story. I'm glad Runt decided to stay in America instead of returning to China for good!"
3,Mix up on the order lowers my review...took one month to get,"I originally bought this book for my son on the same time and date as two others in the series. I got the first two within 3-4 days without any problem. This last one however, I didn't get for one month!! When I finally contacted this seller, they said they had no record of the transaction or my request from Amazon. I forwarded them the email with all of the info and they immediately shipped the book. I got it a few days later and my son was very happy as he needed it for a book report. Once they got involved, everything was great, but to have to wait for nearly a month was extremely annoying. I'm not sure who's responsible for the mix up, but that's why I'm not rating them higher."
2,Just the Facts,"I was disappointed by this book, even though I was interested in the subject matter. The facts are all there, but the style wasn't engaging at all. The book didn't move me. It read like a thinly veiled textbook about the experiences of the Chinese in the American West; in fact, if you skip to the back and read the Historical Note, you'll find all the information you need. Aside from a few observations such as, ""Americans are so rootless. I almost feel sorry for them,"" the voice of Ming-Chung could have belonged to anyone from any nationality. I wish it had reflected more of Chinese attitudes and culture."
5,"The Essential Companion to ""Lessons in Instant ESP""","David St Clair was a Time-Life reporter, and Psychic who traveled the world for 12 years studying all forms of the Occult for the magazine that employed him. This book is an outstanding companion to his legendary ""Lessons in Instant ESP"" and covers a broader canvas, delves more into witchcraft,and addresses moral concerns regarding using these powers for gain.This book is VERY hard to find, and has been purchased for crazy amounts of money (Up to $500) on some sites. I got mine for a reasonable but higher than usual price a year or so ago (never knew it existed) and it was well worth the expense. An amazing companion to ""Instant Esp"" with a much more detailed lesson on 'The Cosmic Forces' and a wide variety of magical studies such as runes, talismans, amulets, astrology, color magic, self hypnosis.If you are a St. Clair fan, do not hesitate. Buy it."
3,A Grain of Salt,"I happen to have known the author very well for several years. She is audacious in nature, and her spirituallity is mixed with great ambition. A careful look at her personal past, her three marriages, and intense desire for spiritual recognition all suggest care should be taken."
2,Express Cooking,"I'm new to using a pressure cooker and have been looking for intersting recipies. I'm really disppointed in this book. It doesn't have any good basic recipies. Most of the recipies are not anything that I am interested in. Who cooks with red wine and figs, anyway???"
1,MISTAKE IN FILLING ORDER,The product is okay. But I ordered 6 jars of Columbian only. I received 3 jars of Columbian and 3 jars of arabica. Why?-- R. MILLER
1,Not what I had in mind!,"I've been searching for a different shower curtain to go in a yellow bathroom and this looked perfect. When it arrived, what I thought was a white background turned out to be a darker beige linen look. The colors were very, very bright and the pattern repeated frequently. I didn't even take it out of the package, just knew at a glance it wasn't what I thought it would look like!"
2,Not our favorite Captain Kangaroo,"This is not like a regular show with the ping pong balls falling on the Captain, or much interaction with the puppets. My two year old really doesn't follow this one like he does the other shows."
4,Great Protection...,"Offers great protection for your MacBook. Very nice fit. Maybe a little too nice. I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 because the sleeve fits so snugly that when I attempt to remove it...it's not as easy as slipping it in. You have to tug and pull. I frequently have to pull my laptop out of it's sleeve for airport security, and it slows me down a little. I usually have to use my teeth and hand to get my MacBook out. LOL. Overall though....great buy!"
5,Excellent sleeve,"This sleeve truly is built for the macbook--it's a perfect fit! It's well padded with a soft interior, and it looks far nicer than I expected from the pictures here on Amazon. It provides great protection for my new macbook without adding tons of bulk. Great product."
2,"Fine in theory, bad design","We've had this cooler for less than a year. It's a great size-- my husband uses it for lunch, and as someone who works in construction and remodeling, he eats a LOT-- but the lid slips open randomly. I really wish we'd bought a different design, one where the lid flips up from the top rather than sliding to the side. We'll be purchasing a new one soon."
3,Didn't quite come through for this Average Joe,"This is a good cooler that holds up well to tough conditions. It also does a good job keeping food cold with a good sized ice pack. My only complaint is that I thought this came with a type of container to put things inside of the cooler. A container that rested near the top but remained inside the cooler where the owner could put his or her keys, wallet, etc. while at work so one didn't have to carry that stuff in their pockets. I've seen guys have them, boughten that way from the brand IGLOO. I was under the impression this had one, but it didn't. If you can manage to find one, they're very nice and handy for the blue collar man."
2,not as described,"I received this and it was supposed to have a food tray in it. It did not and I contacted the shipper and he said he would have one sent to me. So far,I have not received the food tray. Am considering sending the cooler back for a refund as the reason I ordered it was to have one with the food tray."
4,This isn't your typical trip-hop album.,"I'd classify this more as ""ambient-techno"" than I would trip-hop altough I guess that title isn't too far off. Upon hearing the increadible track ""Sundial"" on a local public radio program I searched for this cd for quite awhile and eventually found it more than a year later.This album is very dancy, but not exactly something you would hear in a club. There are alot of ""tapping"", light bells and waterdrop effects on this album and it can only be described as ""unique"".Some of the album has somewhat of a cultrual feel - especially the song ""Sundial"" which has flowing, soft tribal chants, dreamy, floating atmospheres and an underlying, base-driven hypnotic groove.This is somewhat of a difficult cd to compare with anything else - I'm not sure of any other albums that sound quite like this. You simply have to hear it for yourself!"
4,Best suspense movie,Chase a crooked shadow is one of the best suspense movie I have ever seen. It is too bad that the movie is not available in DVD or even VHS format. It is not included in the TCM classics. I would highly recomend Amazon to get this movie on their movie list. Thanks.
3,"A companion piece, at best.","Having read I Flew With the Lafayette Escadrille (highly recommended), I sought out more information on that classic's author, Edwin (Ted) Parsons. This slim little seventy page volume is an expanded version of a 1978 Aviation Quarterly article, and readers shouldn't expect much more than a magazine level summary of Parson's otherwise interesting life. The hyperbolic back cover blurb promises that the booklet ""makes the most colorful segment of World War I come alive"", based on the author's ""unlimited access to Ted Parsons' personal papers and memorabilia."" In reality little more than a, to be fair, very well fleshed-out chronology, it makes an interesting magazine article. Expanded into a booklet, the reader is left regretting that the material was not used to produce a biography worthy of this great adventurer."
4,HSM brown/red wig,"First let me say the shipping was right on time.IF you are looking for a wig to look like Gabriella you should know- this is a dark brown wig- close in color to Gabriella from the movie,and fit nicely with adjustable hooks inside, the style however does not resemble gabriella at all, just long brown hair with part down the middle. My daughter (10)still liked wearing for her school play,(where she played gabriella)rather than her own blonde hair. The accessories in package were what you would get at dollar store but for $14.99 for the package(with the free super saver shipping if you ordered $25) I feel it was worth the price."
3,Not bad but could be better,"The clock is beautiful!! It kees good time and the chimes are very clear and pleasant. However, when I got the clock, it wouldn't run. I didn't want to pay to have it shipped back and take the chance that the next one would be the same. I took it to my local Jeweler, who fixes clocks,and he told me that the inside workings of the clock were very dry. He oiled them and straightened the bent mainspring and it works fine. On top of the original price that I paid for the clock, it cost me another $50 and two weeks without my wife's Christmas present giving her the joy that I had intended. But as I said, it is a beautiful clock and it, now, works wonderfully. I guess, all in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
2,The only SLR camera for my small hand,Although I gave 3 stars in the last review for the picture quality but I alway give canon full credit for a small lady hand. It is the only SLR camera that give my small hand good grip.
3,Shipping Details,Real quick shipping. I ordered on 26th and received on 29th Morning. Thanks for the fast delivery. Appreciate the fastness. I am using the camera & will give the comments.
5,A great first camera,"For my first ""serious"" camera, I do not believe I could have chosen better than the Rebel 2000. This camera is so appealing because it is light-weight, easy to use, offers enough photographic options to please a more demanding photographer without offering too many to confuse a new photographer, and has a built in flash. Without much knowledge of cameras to base quality of photos taken on, I can say that this is a great starter camera. There is much room to grow from this camera, as Canon offers many up grades. You can be as automatic or as manual as you chose. Photography amateurs looking for a camera, this is it!"
5,Excellent results!,"I am an amateur seeking to learn photography but at the same time don't want a machine which needs tuning every time I take a photograph. Rebel 2000 fits the requirement, right from manualy tuning everything to point and shoot. And amazing factor is the result, quality of photographs! they are just awesome.."
5,Great Camera for beginners,"Unlike a lot of reports about grainy pictures and what not; this camera is really top notch! This is my first camera and I got some really great shots already, the grainy complaint was probably due to people using a higher ISO and not knowing much about camera settings. You'll definitely want a zoom lens though, the 28-80mm is nice for normal everyday things, but if you really want to experiment try looking for a 28-300 or even a 70-300mm lens.Definitely recommended for amateurs."
3,Cannon Rebel Series,As a professional photographer I got my start using the Cannon Rebel series before switching over to Nikon professional cameras. I have had the chance to shoot this new Rebel camera and it is a great improvement over their previous editions. I do have to warn you though that even though the Rebel is great for amateurs its construction and especially its lense makes it a very fragile camera. I've broken two of them myself and my sister broke hers the day she got it. A better camera in the same price and skill range for amateurs and entry-level professionals is the Nikon N50. It's an easy camera to use and much more rugged.
3,"Nice camera, but not a significnt improvement over P & S.","I am not an expert on photography. I just wanted to buy the best camera I could afford. So, I bought this Cancon Rebel 2000 on sale at a local electronics store over 2 years ago. Well, the pictures I am getting are good pictures, but not exceptional. My friends owns a P&S camera that he bought for less than 100 dollars and I cannot distinguish his pictures from mine. This camera although light for SLR, is still bulky and rather heavy. I would recommend buying a good Point & Shoot camera that is light and small, and will produce pictures of pretty much the same quality."
4,IT IS WORTH THE MONEY,I used Canon Eos 3000 I got the Rebel 2000.I am a serious photo enthusiast and expose one roll a month. I find the Auto Focus of the Rebel 2000 with any Canon Ef lens a little difficult in the night shots.
2,It is not what I wanted,"Hello;The product is not what I wanted so it will not have any use from me. I don't blame the seller but I do blame myself for not paying attention to the products detail. I will make sure not to make this mistake again since now I am left with a product that will not be used.Best Regards,"
3,"Good for a beginner , Too sharp for its own good","It is an advance point and shoot camera. Very very very light, easy to used, although I was quite lost in the way it was written in the user manual about the focus point.Rasor sharp lens, sometimes it is TOO sharp, too much contrast. It looks like a touched up photo (the way you cut and paste the objects from 2 photos and put it in the same picture, like in Adobe Photoshop programe). It really distroy the mood of the picture, well, I am not professionl photography.I hope their will be a build in filter function as in my old Canon Rebel II. I know that a filter adapter is available separately, but will be so inconvenient to carry it around. Why does cannon take take out such a wonder feature from a camera of the millenium ?"
5,WOW! I love my new Camera!!,"I am a ameture photographer and I love my new camera, I also enjoy my low price Amazon Your the Best! Im so happy that I finally found a price I can Afford!! Thank You!!"
3,EOS Models,"This is probably good. Unlike the EOS66 which has a problem when used indoors in taking pictures. Before buying a camera, make sure you know well the brand. Inquire on the nearest Repair/Service shop near you. The nearest store near you. Customer support should be in a high list. So if your going to buy a CANON, make sure they can be approached when you have queries and needed help. I think they need to improve on this department. Even how great the camera is, but you can't contact them for support, its like a bad investment. Don't let your hard earned money go to waste. Be carefull. Be very carefull..."
5,Great All Around SLR,"The Canon Rebel EOS 2000 is really one of the best buys in 35mm film cameras. The autofocus 28-80 lens works for all but the longest shots, and telephoto lenses are readily available. It's user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price. It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality. I've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do) and love them, but Nikon doesn't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range. This camera is comparable to the old AE1 Program(a great camera also), but with more features and even easier to use. A lot of ""Bang For The Buck""!"
5,Canon EOS Rebel,"I've owned this camera for a while. I love mine. It's easy to use, the autofocus is accurate, and the metering is supurb. It's fast if you want to shoot action shots like at a race or rodeo.I decided to rate this camera when it popped up in my ""Gold Box"" offers.Jim"
4,"Good camera, bad lens","I checked this camera and lens for a newspaper review and found the camera a fantastic one for beginners and intermediates. The lens leaves a lot to be desired, so if you really want good images and are a beginner or not really interested in buying an expensive body, go for the Canon 28-105 lens long with this body, which will give you much better images than the lens offered. The body itself is a real versatile SLR with a lot of features that seasoned pros would be surprised to find in such an economic model."
5,"Hcstony Cameras, best seller on Amazon!","This is the BEST experience ever on Amazon!! Stellar seller responded to email in minutes, upgraded my shipping at no charge to priority mail). Camera is in MINT condition and takes incredible pictures. We cannot recommend this seller enough! Thanks for everything!!Purchased from hcstony cameras."
5,A great start,"After I bought this camera, I bought a book by John Shaw, Nature Photographer's Complete Guide to Professional Field Techniques and started using them both to learn how to take pictures. The results were amazing. Really! I've had more than satisfactory results with indoor shots also. I was able to test it during the New York autoshow and the pictures came out as if they were taken by a professional. Very encouraging! It is very easy to use and most of the functions are automated. The metering is almost accurate. I checked this the way John Shaw says in his book. My camera did not need any extra calibration at all. I also had the opportunity to check out the Nikon N60 before I bought the Canon and the handling of Nikon was way difficult and too heavy also. This is definitely a good buy for anyone entering the world of photography."
3,"Love, Sex and Guns: A Summary of The Amores, by Ovid","The Amores, by Publius Ovidius Naso, will leave your loins on fire and your heart as cold as ice. Coming from a time of Roman warriors and Greek gods, Publius Ovidius Naso, better known as Ovid, set the world and its many women on fire. With his mentions of charm and perfect bodies, he captures his audiences' hormones, as well as their imaginations. In The Amores, Ovid expresses sexual reminiscences of a woman named Corrina who may just as well be fictional. He tells us of her beautiful long hair and the body she possesses that is nothing short of perfect. Ovid shares with us his analysis of love as well as life."
4,MovieMind for Screenwriters,"I found MovieMind a clear and concise guide to script writing. Because of the author's no nonsense approach it was easy to read. Reading it reminded what brought me to writing in the first place, the creative process. Creating a world and characters that have lives that don't exist, yet could - at least for a little while. And the book pointed out the pitfalls that I fell into when I stopped writing. The index cards, I've resisted their use as more clutter. But see their use differently now. What I found most illuminating is in the last few chapters on marketing. I guess there are easier professions to break into. But lets face it if storytelling is in soul than that is path that must be taken. The real test will be if I start writing again."
2,A disappointment as usual,"Unfortunately the art work in this graphic novel and in the B/A comic books leaves a great deal to be desired. This is generally true of Buffy material in most categories (except my new Spike t-shirt). I wonder whether the PTB think fans of the two shows are capable of appreciating better quality art work. I also felt the plot was thin, but that is generally true of Golden's books. They are mostly one tiresome fight after another arranged along a predictable story line with no characterization at all. Of course I buy and read every novel and comic book that comes out, especially during the summer when I miss the new episodes. I find that much of the fan fiction on the net is better than the pulp offerings."
3,Has Promise,"Vampires prey on humans, but who preys on vampires? The Hollower begins stalking Angel, but could also bring him salvation.This story was interesting but a little predictable at times and I am not overly fond of the artwork. Still the storyline will hopefully pave the way for some new grahic novels for Buffy's favourate vampire. Buffy fans will be flocking to the new Angel storyline."
3,Not bad,"To be honest, I'm not a big fan of Angel. I certainly am tired of seeing flashbacks to all the horrible things he's done because its the same thing over and over. The Hollower preys on vampires, a pretty cool idea, and you'd think its good that the Hollower eats vampires. However, if he eats a certain amount then he'll turn to humans instead. The artwork isn't too great and the story is mostly fighting and flashbacks about Angel and some girlfriend he used to have. I read other bad reviews but still bought this because the idea of the Hollower was pretty cool. It wasn't what I had hoped. Luckily I got the book on sale at the comic book store but I don't know if it would be more than what I paid for it. I wouldn't buy this again, but if you love stories about Angelus' past, this is for you."
4,still WOW!,"I love this song & Christina has just an incredible voice. I was disappointed that the original radio version was not on this single (ALL remixes), but you still get so much range from Christina that you have to love it anyway. This is right up there with ""Beautiful"" & Christina will continue to shine. Peace & love. Tonya S."
1,If I'd Never Known Your Love,"I don't know what everyone saw in this book. It was actually quite boring. Not the plot, but the writing. I don't even know how I feel about any of the characters because they were all so...flat. Julie had no personality whatsoever. Shelly, her daughter, was dramatic and therefor quite annoying at times. The only person who had any feelings, or who we ever got to see into their mind really, was David, and he's taken out of the story because of the surprise ending. The story, though, jumped a lot in time, and I eventually just gave up because I couldn't keep going back and forth so often. It caused a struggle to make sense of things going on in the present. Really getting into this book was hard because of the disassociated way it was written, as if it were just a story and not a novel."
4,does the job,After purchasing and returning a samsung bluetooth I bought this one and it is great. The sound is fantastic (I could not hear a thing on the samsung one) and the range is pretty good. The battery life is great. I was surprised to read such a poor review of this item. I would recommend this item to a friend.
1,Dont buy from ccaccesaries,This did not work when i got it. it said new but deff. was not new. I had to return this thing 3 times and then i just returned it got my money back and went out and bought one. Now IM HAPPY!! Hope this helps you!!
2,"The Cook's Guide to Boston Restaurants, 2001-02","When first reading, I thought I'd find many of my favorites (I've lived here for 8 years & we eat out frequently in Boston & surrounding areas), but I found a surprising omission of many of the area's ""gem"" restaurants.In particular, there was a huge oversight in not including Centro in Cambridge. What a fabulous rustic Italian spot, co-owned by one of the country's top chefs, Rene Michelena. It has also received rave press reviews so that omission was a shocker.I suggest more homework next time."
5,Beautifully Written - Couldn't Put it Down,"""Out of Grace"" is a beautifully written reminder that no matter what mistakes we've made or sins we've committed, if we are truly repentant and ask God to forgive us, He will do just that. I was so intrigued by the story line and various characters, that I couldn't put the book down until I had completed it. I also bought it to give as gifts to my family. Each person I gave the book to found it so suspense-filled, they finished reading the book within 24 hours as well. This novel is highly recommended reading for those in need of forgiveness and a taste of God's grace."
5,Compelling and Captivating,"Out of Grace is not the usual 'Christian' novel about living the ""perfect"" life. In fact, this book really gets down to where you live. Tired of reading about situations that couldn't possibly 'really' exist, or wondering if they do, why YOUR life isn't that way? Then you need to read, ""Out of Grace"". This book is for 'real' people, with real issues. It's about time that Christian authors stand up and 'tell it like it is' instead of hiding behind Christianity. Out of Grace dares to deal with reality, then shares the truth about God's Grace, that it was sent especially for the 'sinner'! This is a most inspiring piece of work, an encouragement to the true 'Christian' who is trodding the blood bought pathway to heaven."
5,Hooked on Eckert,I'm hooked on these Allan Eckert books. The Conquerors has a multitude of characters to follow in this work. All of their true experiences are nail biting. I find myself following their paths by searching all of the maps that are included in the book. I plan on reading all 6 of his 600 plus page novels.
5,conquerers review,Product arrived promptly ahead of targeted due dateand was in the condition described
2,"The plot is OK, but the writing sucks.","The plot is OK (with 7 of 9, how can it be bad?) but he writing is terrible. It does tell you much about seven of nine, and it only briefly (1.5 pages) has a part to allow you to get to know seven. It is not a replacement for the episodes, an I do not recomend it for most people. Its only real use is to learn the few things it has about seven in it."
2,Borg Beauty breezes by Beautifully but book is boring!,"The only good things about this book are Seven and the Doctor. Everything else is ho-hum. The story, aliens, devices,etc. I wish I could have enjoyed it more but it was just an ok read."
4,Seven of Nine succeeds,"Christie Golden has shown a good grasp of Voyager characters. In this novel, she overshadows her earlier ST works. This is a good story, well told. Intriguing and interesting, I would place it with the handful of truly memorable ST books including ""The Final Reflection"" and ""Imzadi."""
3,Not bad,"It is a good novel, for those that love ST, but if you want more than just a good (Voyager) novel read Cybersong."
2,Not worth buying,"I definitely thought that I didn't get my money's worth for this book. Christie Golden uses little cliches instead of real writing, and it seems that she wasn't using all of her imagination when she wrote this. It was kind of interesting, though, at least enough that I waited untill I was finishd reading it to throw the book against my wall and forget about it forever."
1,Life is too short. Read anything else.,"I was originally put off by the harshness of the review of ""A reader from Pennsylvania , August 28, 1998"". Now I think it was far too generous. I kept waiting for the what ""true afficionados of Voyager"" would enjoy. There was nothing. At the beginning of the book, I really thought I was reading a first draft."
2,extremely poor,this book is very poor.it seems as if christie has involved her self in some thing way out of her league try again christie. r
4,A book about a character.,"Seven of Nine. The cover says it all.Or most of it, atleast.This book is set somwhere in the beginning of season five, offering good characterization and a decent plot, like all the books I've read from Cristie Golden.The book is a unique piece of character building about Seven of Nine, wich should be read by anyone waching the series. And what's most important, also other characters are given pages.Golden is undoubtedly the best Voyager writer we have seen so far, and she never seases to satisfy me by ways of both storytelling an characterization.And although the plot of this particular novel might be a bit predictable as a whole, it holds out pretty well. Absolutely recomendet."
4,A bit slow,"This book was really slow to begin with! It was quite boring, but got a lot better towards the end. The storyline is quite good, but it's a bit like the episode 'Infinite Regress'. But, stick with it, and it's an excellent book!"
2,Big and Ugly,"When this thing arrived, we were stunned to see exactly how large it was. It took up so much room that we couldn't find a suitable place for it.It was also ugly--a large chunk of beige plastic. I can't imagine any room into which it would fit in terms of design or simply pleasing appearance.Combined with the size, the ugliness makes the thing eminently returnable, and so we sent it back.If neither of these things matters to you, then you may find it useful. It appears to be functional."
1,not a good choice,This product was unacceptable. It lacked stability and was not high enough to reach the top of the bed. It was for an 8 pound pomeranian.
1,Another OOPS,"Steps are very narrow at top and the sides are very weak and unstable. I tried every trick I could think of to get my miniture dachsund to use them but it just wasn't going to happen. Do to the cost of return shipping I gave mine away, maybe they will have better luck."
1,Damaged Goods,"I ordered these stairs and were shipped to me only covered in heavy plastic. When I opened the top of the package, the top stair was cracked and several pieces were broken off. I did not open the rest of the package, since I was returning it immediately.I taped the top of the package and returned it to a UPS store. They could not believe that this product had no packing protection. It was easy to see how the damage occurred. I did get my refund, but I was extremely dissatisfied with this company that couldn't spend additional money to make sure that their product would arrive in its intended quality."
4,The Jury is Still out with Roxy,"These stairs would be good for my dog but she is still wary of them. a great product, sturdy and very functional. a bit clumsy but still i know as she ages they will come in handy. i received the order very promptly and it was boxed well. would reccommend dealer again."
4,Pet Steps,"I bought these for my small Westie to get up on a high bed. We have another medium size dog that uses them and also our cat uses them. The back sticker says they are good for up to 70lb, don't know that I would trust that much weight on them. These steps are great for a small animals to be able to get up and down from the bed. Good value for the price, remember you are buying a set of plastic steps. As noted in an earlier review, needs non-slip and non-scratch bottom for wood floors. Works good on carpet."
2,Plastic piece of junk,"I am very unhappy with my purchase of the Petmate Pet Step. I have two small dogs, one is a puppy and the other is 10. My ten-year-old is really the one who needs it, but is afraid to use it because the stairs aren't wide enough. I've tried everything to get him to use them; now he has a severe neck injury and can't even make it on the couch let alone the bed and I have to buy a new set of wider stairs.Just be weary before you buy this product. It may be ok for dogs with very short legs, but not for a heavier older dog."
5,great for the money,"We have a 5 pound dog and they work great for him. They are plastic, but what do you want for that price!"
3,"Lightweight and easy to move, but slippery for dogs","These steps are very affordable, slim, lightweight, and easy to move to clean around, but only half of each step is covered with carpet and therefore slippery for the dogs. My dogs were actually sort of afraid of them. I ended up buying carpet step treads (made for regular stairs) and cutting them to fit the dog stairs. Once the steps were fully carpeted, the dogs liked them much better and use them!"
4,Pet Steps,We needed steps to help our doxie get on the bed. We had to lay a bath sheet over the steps as she found then to slick and was scared to use them also if she jumps to hard on them from the bed it will scoot away and she can't get back on the bed.With some simple modifacations we have made it perfect.
2,"Great Price but my Basenji""s won't use It","This was the best price on the web. The steps are sturdy and seem like an ideal way for my nimble puppys to get on my platform bed, but the dogs hate it and will only go up it if I force them. I suspect that there are too many steps. Making them a three step and broader steps would make it more useable."
1,Petmate Pet Steps,"These steps are hard plastic. If you have hardwood floors, do not buy these. They do not have any pads (rubber or plastic) underneath to hold it in place."
2,Needs to have more carpeting,"Bought this for my aging dog, there is not enough traction carpet on it, he misses the small treads with his claws and he slips off and falls off. Other than that this is a great height for a bed, takes him right even with it, but it just needs more carpet on it. If the fully carpeted it, that would be great. I cut an arch in the back (the tall part) and the cat loves it. A 2-1 deal!!"
4,enjoyable,"Les Choristes is enjoyable to listen to, very uplifting...the boys' have such beautiful voices."
4,"Great Film, Great Music!","I saw this film when it premiered in France, and immediately bought the CD. The music is lovely, and some of the children featured in the movie are in the actual choir, including the soloist, that made the album. All of the songs are original to the film, with my personal favorite being Cerf-Volante, which means ""kite"" in french. The lyrics and music dance through your senses just as if the tune were floating in the sky. The only reason I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, is due to the fact that the choral songs are very short. They are so beautiful, but end way too soon, leaving you wanting for more. If it was possible, I would really give this CD 4 1/2 out of 5!"
4,"Great music, but missing some songs from the movie","I rented this movie last year, and really enjoyed it. However, when I bought the CD, I discovered it was missing my favorite song from the movie. However, the songs on the album are absolutely beautiful."
5,Most wonderful beautiful angelic music ever,"It seems to me that I knew little about the film when I went to see it. I can rate it as the best movie I have ever seen, (except for the Lord of the Rings) with the most wonderful music I have ever heard and I don't ever listen to boy's chorus music. I can't stop listening to this cd."
5,GREAT SOUNDTRACK,The CD is a wonderful soundtrack for an outstanding French film.The music is soothing yet haunting; the voices are perfect.The Chorus (Les Choristes)
2,Plots are becoming ridiculous,I've read Bertrice Small's books for YEARS and we're now entering the world of silly instead of sexy. This book has put me off the romance novel aisle at Walden's altogether.
4,A Distant Tomorrow,This is nice read a little different from other Bertrice Small novels. It is nice to have some magic!
2,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS, BUT ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE SERIES","LET ME START BY SAYING I LOVE BERTRICE SMALL!!! THAT SAID I CAN'T STAND HOW LARA'S STORY IS REPEATED IN DETAIL TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON SHE MEETS. IT GETS VERY BORING. OTHERWISE THE STORY IS GOOD, THE CHARACTERS ARE GOOD, THE SETTING IS INTERESTING. GOOD CONCEPT, JUST NOT EXECUTED WELL. IF YOU LEFT THE REPETITIONS OUT THESE BOOKS WOULD BE VERY SHORT"
4,enjoyable read,I liked this second installment of the Hetar series. It is nice to see a full novel and not a collection of short stories. the story moves at a good pace and flowed well in my opinion. Kudos to Ms. Small for this work!
3,Show me the magic!,"It was very clever for Mrs. Small to use the anagram of EARTH for both HETAR and TERAH. I was surprised that Lara had steamy sex scenes with only one man (unusual for the author's heroine characters)on this book. And of course the heroine ABANDONED her children again(this I would say typical of the author's heroine characters) then claims that she's a good mother(BS). Lara acted stupid on the part when she introduced Magnus as dominus/ruler of a place called Terah to Gausius and Jonah thus opening the pandoras box of curiosity about the place. And also I don't understand why the Shadow Princes with all their good power/magic would let an evil and greedy man like Gausius Pospero (and Jonah in tow) to rise in to power. Because of these I guess with all their magic, Lara and the Shadow Princes are not very smart after all. But then of course that's the part and twist of the story the author would say!"
5,Our 3-year old daughter loves it,"A real guitar, not a toy. Very nice looking and sturdy.Didn't come aith the accessories though.We now have to learn how to play..."
3,I expected more,"I read the rave reviews about this book and bought it immediately. While I agree the author is quite capable and the story is intriguing....I wanted more back story of the protagonist Sabine. The story throws us right into her life in Paris as she studies abroad and I somehow felt I was missing information. We get flashes of her life growing up as the story progresses but for me there was always something lacking. Also, and this is simply my opinion, I didn't realize the story was set so many years ago, and the reference to the French Franc and other antiquated items were distracting."
2,Rambling storyline,"I thought from the summary the book would be more interesting, but I found it to be more rambling and without direction than I had hoped. It felt like it finally got to the point of the book, then it ended. The characters rich background was lost in the back and forth of flashbacks with out good cues. I guess the French mixed in was to remind us she was in Paris, I found it annoying."
2,Failing Paris,"I thought I would like this book, but I have trouble getting into the story. I read about 5 chapters and then put the book down. Maybe I will pick it up again in the future."
5,A Home Run for Dunn,"Samantha Dunn has demonstrated her spectacular literary prowess in her gripping memoirs ""Not By Accident"" and ""Faith in Carlos Gomez,"" and ""Failing Paris"" definitively shows that her skills extend to novels as well. This book broadened my appreciation of her work. I'll read anything this woman writes."
1,Failed Paris,"I was disappointed with this book. To begin with, the main character is unsympathetic (even after finding out about her awful upbringing), uninteresting and most times stupid. She sleeps with anyone and everyone she meets. They could basically run into her and she'll let them have their way with her. She's attacked several times while walking all hours of the night. Every man in the book is a vile, disgusting person (except for Abe, but we never find out what happens with that). I am all for flawed main characters, but I don't care about Sabine. I never root for her. I actually end up feeling like she deserved the mess she got into and she pisses me off. The whole thing is depressing and a bigger story never pans out. The author has a talent for putting words together nicely, but storytelling is severely lacking. The book is also too short to be taken seriously. It's more like a novella. Unimpressed."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This may be the worst book I have ever read. I am an avid, open-minded reader who reads many different genres. Every book I have ever read has captured my interest in one way or another, carrying me through until the end. This book, however, did not. I could not finish reading Failing Paris, putting it down 25% completed, never to pick it up again. It is one of the most poorly written books I have ever had the displeasure to begin reading."
1,Aweful,"Worst book I've ever read. It was slow starting out but many great books are, so I kept reading. Half way through I kept asking myself why I was wasting my time but I kept hoping for a miraculous ending. It never came. The main character is troubled and struggling to find herself and her place in the world. That in itself is ok and could have great potential, but it was never developed into anything great. The writing was not particularly good either. Everything in the book just seems to drag on and on and on. I highly recommend focusing your efforts on something more productive and engaging."
3,It was an dreary read,"It read like a sad movie although it was a fairy quick read. This poor girl seemed to have such a mediocre life. She seemed to just tread through trying to hang on to her sanity. Towards the end, you finally feel that she is realizing her ability to stand strong on her own two feet. Finally, she starts to acknowledge the sun despite the rain."
2,"Starts sad, stays sad...","This book is written in third person-sort of. The narrative style keeps you at arm's length from the character, and after a while you want to shake her and say, ""Snap out of it! You're in Paris! Get a grip!"" Sadly, she never really does. If you like dark non redemption stories...very gritty, then this is your cup of tea. Just don't wear your good shoes so you can wash the crud off of them that you pick up on the Paris streets."
1,NO STAR,"Terrible, This analysis of a lost belly button by a psychotic. I can't believe it even got published. Only positive is maybe even I could write a moronic self absorbed tirade and get published."
2,Sort of boring,I'm glad I only paid a dollar for this one. It's like all the other dollar books for Kindles. Boring. Probably won't finish it.
1,Mired in useless knowledge,"When I read the first chapter of Failing Paris, I was intrigued. The author caught my attention with her descriptive writing but as I continued to read, I found myself feeling claustrophobic -- the story wasn't going anywhere and the characters were dull or irritating or depressing. After chapter 6 or 7, I had to put it down. At that point, I didn't care what happened to the main character. She wasn't likable or witty or funny."
3,It was not for me.,Not a book I was able to get into. I love Paris and the title intrigued me. Others may well like it.
2,It's An Okay Read,"The book is okay, it's not what I thought it would be. Still reading it because I want to see how it ends."
2,It failed me.,"This book was a little too dark for me; something I may have liked in my 20's or 30's, but nothing I would recommend to my friends."
1,Awful,"I must be missing something. I am continuing to try and finish this book but basically I dont like the way it is written, someone telling a story and referring to themselves as you all the time. The main characters are unlikeable and I am not sure what the point is. Its not as described. I keep picking it up looking for some redeeming quality but cant find it. Because of the award winning status I may keep trying and change my review."
2,ok,"Brief not interesting or specific, lost interest in this book and I want as much info as possible on Paris."
2,Difficult to care,"I kept thinking I might start to care about the main character in this book, but as it went on I felt less and less interest in her situation and its various mishaps."
3,Failed Me,"I can't say I truly ejoyed Failing Paris all that much. I think if the author had been a bit more introspective or reflective, it could have helped to add some depth to the book. I guess the title should have given me a clue as to the author's lack of experience in life's heavy, mind altering decisions."
1,Unpleasant main character,"The main character of this book is not someone you wish to read about. I too only got through less than 20% of the book before giving up on it. It's way too wordy and needs some action to get you involved in the story. Of the seventy plus Kindle books I have ordered, this is only one of two that I could not read."
3,Vortexes,"I was just in Sedona the weekend of 1/2/09 and there are now only three vortexes. Boynton Canyon, Chicken Point, and a new one near the visitors center in Cottonwood. But there are vortexes in every state, discover them yourself!"
3,Please rent don't buy,First of all here are the matches Match 1- Edge vs Owen Hart I give it an 5 out of 10 for somegood wrestling quality Match 2- Tag Team Match Al Snow and Scorpio vs Too Much I give it an 6 ou of 10 for some high risks. Match 3- Marc Mero vs Droz I give it an 3 out of 10 only because of Marc Mero's High risks. Match 4- Falls Count Anywhere Match Vader vs Bradshaw I give it an 7 out of 10 becuse it had some good moves in it. Match 5- Gangrel vs D'lo Brown I give it an 5 out of 10 because it really was boring. Match 6- Val Venis vs Dustin Runnels i give it an 2 out of 10 because it plainly sucked! Match 7- Six-Man Tag Team Match I give it an 7 out of 10 because it was pretty good Match 8- Triple Threat Steel Cage Match The Rock vs Mankind vs Ken Shamrock I give it an 10 out of 10 because it was great! Match 9- WWF Championship Triple Threat Match Stone Cold vs The Undertaker vs Kane I give it an 8 out of 10 because of the disappionting end! Overall Rating 6 out of 10
4,SUPER CALA FRAGILSTIC EXPY ALADOUCIOUS,Do not buy this tape.Rent it and watch it and then of course review it.The cage match stole the show.Here is my favorite to least favorite.(1)DX v. JJ -n- sothern justice.(2)Austin v.Kane v.Taker.(3)Rock v. Shamrock v. Mankind.(4)Bradshaw v. vader.(5)Droz v. meroThe top 5 of the tape
3,It's a little boring,"I mean don't get me wrong the shamrock, rock, mankind match was sweet but other than that the video was boring. I ended up doing a lot of fast fowarding."
4,No bad could be better,The triple threat match was good. But all the other matches except Mankind v. Rock v. Shamrock in a cage and New Age Outlaws and X-Pac v. JJ & Southern Justice sucked.
3,Not the best and not the worst!,"This video is ok but is not the best I've seen.Some matches were ok and some were dreadful.The matches that were the best were Edge vs Owen Hart, Ken Shamrock vs Mankind vs The Rock in a cage match,and The Undertaker and Kane vs Stone Cold for the championship.The matches that were ok were Gangrel vs Dlo Brown Xpac and the New age Outlaws vs Southern Justice,and Bradshaw vs Vader.The matches that were dreadful were Val Venis vs Dustin Runnels,Droz vs Marc Mero and Al Snow and Scorpio vs Too Much."
2,A decent WWF Pay-Per-View,"This tape has only two great matches. The Undertaker and Kane challenge ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin for his WWF Championship in a Triple Threat match. Also, The Rock, Ken Shamrock, and Mankind battle it out in a Triple Threat Cage Match. A good video to buy just to see these matches."
2,breakdown need I say more,"Do not buy this tape is all I have to say, because mainly the undercard was not ppv worthy except for the cage match, and the triple threat match was long, and boring, there are much better ppvs out there to purchase, please do not purchase this one."
1,feels cheap,"It's hard to believe this is sterling silver. It is weightless, the handle is too short and the ""snuffer"" is bell-shaped and swings on the arm. Not at all practical and feels like a toy. I don't recommend this item at all."
3,Fun book but not what I expected,"I bought this book and Barker's Grub. This book is fun, and nice to look at and does have some good recipes (especially for treats) but I honestly didn't feel comfortable cooking these recipes for my dog on a daily basis. They seemed a bit more careless and thrown together (as in = your dog will love this) and not as conscious of what's healthy and nutrious for your pup. They also seem to be items that go with your dog's processed food instead of ""in lieu of."" I'd recommend it if you just want something to spice it up every once in a while but not as a full-diet."
5,Highly recommended!,"I recently adopted a dog and bought this cookbook because I wanted to supplement a dry dog food diet with some yummy home cooked food. I have since made several recipes in this book and all of them have been a smashing hit with my new pooch. Big favorites are the Lip-Lickin' Liver-Lover's Sauce, chicken & rice stew, peanut butter bones, and ginger bones. I tend to use the stew recipes as a guide more than a strict recipe, sometimes swapping out different veggies and using whole wheat versions of pasta. The stew recipes are great because they are very large -- you can portion them into small containers and freeze them, and you are all set for weeks."
2,Not What I Expected,I was expecting a more inventive book. They actually had recipies like mac and cheese - gee I wouldn't have thought of that! Most recipies are just simple human food. The cookie recipies all looked the same.
5,"YUMMY! Kim Bloomer, Owner of Aspenbloom Pet Care","Oh just yummy! This book has the best recipes in it for our canine friends. In fact, when you see how beautifully this book is illustrated and the awesome, natural ingredients you'll think this is a book for human treats and foods. You'd be right too because the recipes use all human grade foods.I LOVE this book!Kim Bloomer[...]"
3,Not what I was looking for...,"I threw this book into my order as an extra last minute thought. I should have read more reviews before I bought it. The book is well done, lots of pictures and an easy to read layout, but it's not a complete and balanced guide to cooking for your dog. It's more of how to create special treats or how to supplement commercial kibble with creative homemade toppings. It has meats like ham and sausage that vets would not recommend, spices that dogs don't need, cheese... things like that. But again, it is a well done book for treating your dog here and there. So I will try out the biscuit recipes. If your goal is to cook for your dog them I recommend Dr. Becker's Real Food for Healthy Dogs and Cats: Simple Homemade Food which is a complete guide."
1,This book stinks!!!,This book is recipies only--zero nutritional-needs information for dogs. It has pictures of food prepared for presentation (like my dog cares...) and nothing else. Don't buy it unless you have nothing better to do than prepare food for your doggie dinner party.
2,MONEY MONEY MONEY,tOO PRICEIE rEPLACED BY LIQUID PRODUCTS. WHY NOT AVAILABLE @ WALLEY GREEN'S HAVR#E BEEN USING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE jwk
5,great book,"I wish this book had more vitamin information and dog nutritional need information. This book is full of great recipes and ideas for homemade dog food. I would definitely recommend this book but if you are going to make your dog food, you should research dogs nutritional needs and supplement with vitamins if needed."
1,Disappointed,"This book was a real disappointment. It's supposed to be a cookbook, and yet the format is really poor. Each page of recipes has lots of empty space, but the list of ingredients is actually so close to the center binding, that you can't really even read them with ease. You basically have to flatten the book and crease the binding to be able to read the print in some cases. The recipes are fine, but nothing to really fuss over. Overall, I was very sorry I purchased this book."
1,World Globe review,This was advertised as weighing 7 lbs. on a metal base with raised relief mountains. What I received was a 2 lb. globe on an aluminum frame with no raised relief mountains. The same globe I received can be purchased at Walmart for a fourth of the price. I sent my globe back.
2,not such a great product,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas after reading all the reviews about it. No one said anything about the clips being so tight. My husband fishes salt water AND freshwater so he has various poles that are different sizes and thickness. I ended up returning it because he said it wasn't easy to get the poles out of the clips. Some other reviews I read from other web sites on other items said that the clips didn't hold the rod in place too good. This one on the other had was too tight, and it made it difficult to get the pole OUT of the clip. He was afraid of breaking the pole."
4,Provides Background Information,"The author looks at two interrelated entities, complex organizations and how change occurs within them. Due to the complexity, prediction is elusive, but one can view organizations in a structured way even in the midst of change.Five chapters are found in this overview. The book begins with the anatomy of organizations and ends with a discussion on limitations, problems associated with making predictions.Reading a book that was written decades before the field expanded is useful because it helps to see how thinking on the topic has evolved. I recommend this book because it provides a history of the study of organization changes and many of its points are still valid."
3,"Considering REBOL, read this book","REBOL is touting themselves as ""the next generation of distributed communications"". With it, a programmer should be able to develop for most platforms. Currently, REBOL supports 40 platforms by using 10 built-in Internet protocols. REBOL can exchange GUI content. Not only from machine to machine, but from users to machines.This book shows you the basicis of what you can do with REBOL. It is a quick read, so you can make some development decisions without investing a great deal of research time. The book is easy to read and I preferred it over the typical ""Dummies"" book.It is however, debateable as to whether you can get more from going to the REBOL website. If you are an experienced programmer the website may become your source. If you are a new programmer looking for ""cutting edge"" languages, but prefer to learn in a more casual manner, get this book."
5,Newbies & Gurus,"For those new to REBOL, this is an ideal book to learn with. A fast and easy read, you will be writing useful code in no time and having fun doing it. Used in conjunction to the REBOL/Core User's guide, it is a great way to hit the ground running.If you've been using REBOL for a while this is a quick read, a great refresher and handy reference."
3,Okay introduction to a questionable language,"Despite the somewhat annoying ""humor"" and slang-filled writing style, this book does give a painless introduction to the Rebol language. However, after reading most of the book you still won't find any real reason to USE Rebol. It just has no advantage over Perl, which is much more widespread. Rebol does appear to have a smaller ""footprint"" and is supported over many platforms. If that's what you need, Rebol is an interesting option. For any platform where Perl is available, Rebol is a poor 2nd choice. The Rebol website also has a ton of stuff, but I think this book is a much easier way to survey this unusual language."
3,Cowabunga!!!!! Codes!!!!!!!,"The T.M.N.T. strategy guide has codes from page 93 to page 95.Thats probably the only thing this guide is good for though!I mean,it doesn't help you at all!!Anyway,this is what you should do when you see it in the stores:1.Grab a piece of paper and a pen.2.Pick up the strategy guide.3.bring everything,even the guide into the bathroom,don't pay for it.4.write down all the codes that you want.5.return the guide to where it was before.Now you get all the codes for free!!!!!COWABUNGA!!!!!sincerly,kenny"
1,Fatuous and grossly inaccurate,"It is a great shame the authors ruined such a good idea by doing no historical research. It is quite clear that the authors are ignorant of the wealth of research produced by the Darwin industry and of course the Correspondence of Charles Darwin. I could spend a long time doing a hatchet job on the book but I prefer to spend my time going to Snowdonia and walk over the mountains Darwin did his geology and read his geological notes where he wrote them. In all a silly book on a great scientist.. We desperately need a good simple book on Darwin, which avoids all the hype and inaccuracy"
1,Excellent Music for Rapists,"I've been a fan of Deal's Gone Bad for almost 10 years and loved Lord Mike's singing. Yes, I'll admit that some of DGB's songs were a bit sexist. Very much so, in fact.Lord Mike's Dirty Calypsonians blows the lid off of all of this. I am embarassed to play it around ANY of my friends! lucky for me it is mostly rather bland, hokey at best ""calypso"" music. A sample of lyrics:I push it in-- She pulls it outI push it back-- She starts to shout!Wow- And this is the chorus of the song! complete with slide whistles and everything. The jacket is equally embarassing and when I saw them in concert the mood of the crowd was palpably akward. This man well past his prime strutting around the stage like some kind of rockabilly god with women in silly getups... ugh. if anyone wants this cd you can have mine.On the whole though JumpUp is one of my favorite record labels. So don't hold it against them."
2,Carbine sling and oiler,"This is advertized as genuine G.I. M-1 quality, it is not. The sling is 5 inches shorter than a USGI sling. I have always trusted Amazon, Sorry I didn't look elsewhere for this item."
3,Strap and Oiler,"This is a copy of the original strap with the oiler which holds the strap into the butt of the gun. It does not come with any explanation so figuring out the oiler placement can be a bit of a challenge. As a copy of a military strap this is no frills. For actual field use a modern strap is much more comfortable, but for shows this one will do the trick."
4,Nice Authentic Sling and Oiler,This made a wonderful addition to my M1 carbine. The sling really finished out the weapon very well and gives it a more military look
1,Not Genuine,This doe not fit my M1 Carbine. Buy a different one. Plus it does not come with the oiler. Junk
4,Works very well.,It is a good pump. the only problem is that you have to put something heavy on the fountain part so it will stand up straight and the wind won't blow it down.
3,average,"the product made from good material, however it is very difficult to maintain, i have to clean the filters every week, not like my previous pump where i cleaned the filter every 6 to 8 weeks, also have difficulty keeping the filter submerged, have to put a couple of bricks on it"
4,Good job but a little feeble,"In the first place, on the whole, the rendition of the harpsicord (cembalo) is weak and the recording too much resonat and blurred, also too much on the background. The problem here is not the lack of the cello but the work of cembalo (harpsicord). Even the violin in the slow pieces give a rendition feeble, devoid of strenght and intensity, and also in the fast piece is a little strange; but on the other hand it's a considered and refined choice that could be appreciable. However the Manze sound, skill and style (and strictly on period) is unquestionable and after all this cd is a good choice.P.S. And the recording is a little too resonant too."
3,Space Opera,"This is a good juvenile Science Fiction work. It is a bit heavy handed, but that was the nature of the medium at the time. If you are looking for a window into the thinking of the period, I would recommend it as an early example of the Baby Boom rebellion against the status quo. It is not a book that will be considered as great literature -- it is a comic book without pictures. Nothing deep here, just fun to read on a lazy weekend."
3,Good - but Nothing Innovative,"VAS is much better all around, but especailly with regards to the skill and intensity of the singing. In the fallout from the Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance many bands have stepped in to fill the need for this kind of stuff, but Stellamara is not the best of them. VAS is by far the best out right now. Buy both."
4,Refreshing ballad variety,"It seems that most songs on ballad CD's sound the same. Not so with ""Pirates Son."" Each is a separate story with a variety of accompaniment. As a cruising sailor, ""Sail Away"" has become the most often played track...sounds like my life. I think any listener will find themselves in one or two of the cuts. Great music for any occassion."
2,World Finals 2 & What Freestyle???,need to pull your inventory and have gravdigger run it over.this looks like it was a cut and paste job.
2,Wrold Finals 2 and a half,"The DVD has World Finals 3 Freestyle, not World Finals 2 Freestyle. Improperly manufactured!"
3,"Awesome Racing,, Wrong Freestyle","*Monster Jam World Finals II: Racing and Freestyle*It should read..Monster Jam World Finals II: RacingMonster Jam World Finals 3: Freestyle===The racing on this dvd is from the World Finals 2 (as it says), BUT the Freestyle on this dvd is from the World Finals 3. Looks like someone messed up when they made this DVD."
1,doe not buy,this antenna sucks. even if you hook up a amp. to it. I bought this antenna with a amp. Everytime I wanted to change the channel I had to move the antenna for 5 min.
1,WOW! What a lack of truth.,"More than willing to discuss, consider, or correct what people might think about religions, but this is one of those total mistruth books made about many religions by some organization who doesn't care about writing facts and just letting a person consider it for themselves."
4,Food for thought,"Enjoyable as it is to read Zizek (the table of contents is itself a work of art), the inflation of 180 degree turns ("" in fact, the EXACT OPPOSITE is the case / is the better interpretation) and the phrase ""this is PRECISELY what Lacan meant with ....."", makes it impossible to give more than 4 stars.Though there is a certain emptiness / lack of practical implications in Zizek's writings (which he defends in terms of refusing to provide the Left with ""the formula"" they demand, instead using his fame to position himself as object a, frustrating our demands), it should be noted that he definitely penetrates deeply into the field of political thinking, too, and he has made me revise some of my opinions about Scandinavian social democracy."
3,Lacanian Overload,"Slavoj Zizek's dense tome is a wandering and unfocused investigation of what he refers to as a 'parallax,' ""the apparent displacement of an object (the shift of its position against a background), caused by a change in observational position that provides a new line of sight."" Zizek examines numerous instances of the 'parallax gap' in multiple spheres of social life, from the political to the pop. There are brilliant explanations of Hegelian dialectics here, but Zizek's Lacanian lens is both interesting and restricting. He is ultimately unable to free himself from the baroque terminology of the late analyst and as a result his interpretation suffers from verbose terminology and awkward shifts of perspective. This is a rich book with plenty of insightful ideas, but it fails from sloppiness and lack of discipline."
5,Great for Dorms,"What I loved about this set was that it was a pull-open container which made it a million times easier to have in my dorm last year. You didn't have to reach for a can opener. Same taste (clearly) as normal Starkist tuna and was really a whole fillet, not chunky passed off as fillet.Keep in mind that these are in smaller sizes than you typical grocery store can but not that much smaller. So you may want to order double."
2,Solid?,"The can of Starkist ""Solid White Albacore"" I opened looked more like ""Chunk Light"" tuna, with random bits of fish and other dark fish parts that one doesn't normally associate with ""solid white albacore."" In all my other experiences of eating solid white albacore from other brands, the can usually contains a ""solid"" piece of fish from one part of the fish, not chunks and bits from who knows where. Don't get me wrong, I eat chunk light tuna as well and it's fine for sandwiches and everything, but that's not what I paid for. At least with the can I opened, it seems like they either made a mistake or were cutting corners. Very disappointed."
1,Be aware of the actual weight,"Pounce Chicken and Turkey Flavors Tartar Control Crunchy Cat Treats is described as 6.4 ounces, but is only 4.5 oz, and it is not a 5-pack."
4,The Essential Book For Facilitators,"There are many books for facilitators. The vast majority seem to focus on activities, with a section devoted to facilitation. This is a book that assists experiential education practitioners with the Essential Elements of Facilitation. If only every book title were as true to the content. Priest, Gass and Gillis have succeeded in authoring a succinct, yet comprehensive book. Within our organization, this selection will become required reading for new and experienced facilitators.As an experienced facilitator you will likely find this book to be an excellent reference book. If you are new to the field, you will likely find this book invaluable.I have recommended no other professional book more frequently over the past year."
2,REALLY?,"I picked this book based on 'listmania'(from amazon), then I looked at some of the review that even Cindy Crawford wrote (which made me want to read it). But not what I expected, did not like the book at all, stopped reading half way through it."
4,Fun beach read.,"Fun to read when going to the beach for a weekend or on a plane. Very much a girly book. Not a whole lot to the story line, but a good read."
2,No there there,"My sister picked this one up for me because I love Target underwear. I thought it would be a witty take on culture and fashion, but it was mundane and the author seemed a bit self-centered and lacking soul. With a memoir, you have to be invested in the life of the person who's writing it. With this one, all I could think was, ""Gee, any person who has tripped on the sidewalk these days is writing a memoir"" and ""No wonder she can't keep a relationship going."" Seems like she may be a better shopper than a writer, I'm afraid."
1,Horrible,"I thought this was going to be a nice book about fashion and the woman who wears it. Boy, was I disappointed! It is really shallow, reads like something a 5th grader wrote. Seriously! I sooooo want my money back!"
5,Awesome!,"I bought this to replace a previous system owned by someone else. I hooked everything up to my existing amp. It took some tweaks to get the surround just right but when completed, it was awesome! The sub-woofer makes you feel like you are really at the movies. It totally makes the theater room complete. When watching action movies and something blows up, you can feel it... AWESOME!Good deal!"
4,Amazing sound at great price,Hooked these speakers to an Onkyo 606 receiver and could not be happier. I have a small room and they are more than capable of filling every inch.
4,Heads up,I'm a 1st timer with surround systems so I tried to be carful about selecting a system. I went to the big box shops to listen to different systems and before I made the purchase but most of them had limited systems set-up and half of those weren't working. Anyway the system sounds great! I really only use the surround for movies and use the center fill for general tv watching.You'll need to purchase speaker wire and depending on how you configure a long rca cable for the sub since no wires come in the box. Make sure that the sub is powered from you amp. If you don't you'll need to turn off the sub when not in use aor you'll get a low buzzing.
3,Excellent sound quality!!!,"got a great deal... love the quality! sound effects are extremely good, crystal clear sound.I compared this with ""Paradigm"" (forget the rest!). Honestly, does not cross Paradigm, but meets expectations. Mix it up with a nice Onkyo receiver and you will feel the beats!Very satisfied."
3,Good but not enough,I had been an audiophile person since 1979. I hooked this system on a pioneer vsx 917. It was kinda of dreadfull. Then I hooked it up with a technics sae 303 w Built in parabolic equalizer still so so. Then I hooked it up with a sansui tube 300z. It was better. This speaker set is a home theater speaker. Not a stereo speaker. Lows as for movies and high are design for surround only. If you are going to use this as a movie only system then a 5.1 channel amp should do the trick. Don't expect it to produce good stereo sound because a good stereo repro must have at least a 10 inch woofer minimum. This set has a subwoofer with an 8 inch driver. You will not get much bass on it except highs from its miniature speakers. Perfect only for home theatre set up.
3,Impressive performance with movies but not music,I used these with a HK AVR 146. I bought them to replace some old Sony HTIB speakers I got from Wal-Mart a few years ago. I hooked them up and watched a movie. I was impressed at how I could hear more detail and gunshots actually had a kick behind them from the actual satellite speaker and not a rumble from the sub. However this was a downside for listening to music. The speakers have too much bass and rattle when used for music. It makes them sound really distorted and cheap. I tried turning the bass down to them but it did not help much. So I ended up returning them. Perhaps other people who use them for music can give tips on this?
3,Very good system for the price.,"I got this system as a gift for Christmas. This was a replacement for a home theater that I had put together. These speakers are a lot smaller then what I had, so I decided to use them. They do look a lot better.The sub sounds good for an 8 inch woofer. However, it does not do the trick for my front room...lacks power. The speakers are great for home theater, but not to good listening to music. Just need more low end power."
5,Great entry level home theater sound.,"After waiting a couple of months for an Onkyo 7.1 system to be in stock, I decided to go with the RM 6750 5.1 system when the price dropped on Amazon. It is connected to an Onkyo 606 receiver that is the hub for our Sharp Aquos HDTV and Memorex DVD upgrading player. The speakers sound great at 30% volume when watching TV or DVDs. I do not like to crank up the volume and these are plenty loud enough for us at 30%. Haven't tried them yet with music; but I am not expecting to be disappointed. I recommend these speakers to anyone wanting a good entry level sound. I stayed away from Home Theater in a box systems because of their limitations.The center channel is clear and dialogue is great. The base rumbles just enough for our taste; but turned up higher will shake the room. The fronts and surrounds provide a good 'in theater' feel. It would be great to add a couple of Polk towers to bring the set up to 7.1 even though we like it as is."
4,Polk Audio RM6750,"The Polk Audio RM 6750 is very good product. It has super-quality. My 5.1 surrounding sound is super. But one thing is troublesome. The sub roofer has two income connectors, which is not usual. There is no standard sub roofer like that. I need to buy a standard cable and a Y-cable making a connection."
5,Just amazing!,Installed the Polk RM6750 speaker system with an Onkyo SR-605 receiver and Onkyo 704 DVD changer. Awesome results!!! Would recommend this system for a 14X24 room in which it sounds WONDERFUL!!!
5,Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 Channel Home Theater,This was a great system. It was easy to install and produce rich surround sound. The woofer really added to the richness of my music and gave my DVD collection quality it didn't have before. It certainly made my home theater system shine. Thank you.
4,Good for movies and TV,"This compact surround system works great with my home theater set-up in a pretty small room, but you might be disappointed if you want to use it to listen to much in the way of music. There's just not enough ""there"" there, which leads this non-audiophile to say that there's probably not enough midrange.Sorry, don't have any alternative suggestions as I am currently considering upgrade options myself. Leaning toward beefing up the fronts first. If there's still not enough window shattering going on, I'll move on to the sub, then the center and finally the surrounds. Again, movies and TV sound great with this system, so long as you're not watching a rock concert film."
4,POLK AUDIO RM6750,"GOOD QUALITY SPEAKER FOR THE BUDGET PRICE, SUB IS POWERFULL FOR IT SIZE. I'VE USED QUALITY SPEAKER WIRES, AND A 7.1 YAMAHA RECEIVER."
3,"If you are looking to get BOSE effect, you do't get it","I ordered this item after reading a lot many reviews. I hooked it up with Onkyo SR-700 receiver. I must say that the speakers are truly good when you play audio cds but when you play movies, it is less dreamy."
4,Good speakers,"The speakers sound really good. I am not much of an audiophile but for my home theater they rock. The only problem I had was that they didn't come with any mounting screws that screw into the back. I bought a pair of satellite stands and have had a really difficult time finding screws with the same thread pattern. Three hardware stores with speaker in hand and still no luck. I e-mailed Polk and they said they would send me a couple. So besides the mounting issues, they sound fantastic."
4,Very good system,"I bought each piece of this system separately as I wanted to add my own newly purchased Sony SA-W2500 10"" powered sub instead of using the 8"" sub that came with the set. I realized I would be paying slightly more this way but it was well worth it.My set-up is: Mitsubishi 60"" hd dlp/JVC RX5060B 5.1 a/v receiver/Magnavox blu-ray player and Direct HDTV. I never thought I could be this happy with my a/v experience but this audio system, bolstered by the enhanced sub, is absolutely awesome! I replaced my previous cheap ($150) RCA surround sound system with this one only months after purchasing it. The thing blew out while watching ""The day the Earth stood still"". My new enhanced RM6750(+) is a complete game changer to my viewing experience. For the price, it's hard to beat this system. I highly recommend it."
4,THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK SAYS IT ALL,"When first heard Cissy Houston sing on one of her 70's solo albums I wondered why this woman is not a household name and espeacially after I found out about her being lead singer of the Sweet Inspirations,this is a book about a woman who never received her just do for someone with such a captivating voice!whether behind the scenes are in front CISSY HOUSTON IS A SWEET INSPIRATION!"
5,Great book!,"I am a die-hard fan of Whitney Houston; and I purchased tons of merchandise when she died! Love the products, great quality and first rate customer service! In memory of ""Ms. Whitney Houston""!!!!!"
1,Not my review!,"TO ALL: I have NEVER read this book, so I have deleted the awful ""review"" that was posted. My apologies to all, and remind me NEVER to leave my computer on when I'm out of the house and people are over thinking that they are funny. NOT SO!!!!!"
5,"Battiato CD + DVD, great concert","Franco Battiato has a long and interesting career. This CD+ DVD collects one of the last concerts of this master italian music and intellectual. Now he is a little old, but he is also wiser. Its music it is sometimes rhythmic and sometimes ballads. The texts (in italian) are always intelectual but also deeply emotional, for instance in ""la Cura"". If you like this CD you also will like ""last summer sance"", a double CD also live. If you are looking for a great composer out of the british or american roots, my first choice would be Franco Battiato. My second choice would be the french music Francis Cabrel."
4,hiking opportunities,The book delivers a good reference for hiking options in the White mountains. It also details the best places for view points on each trail. A very thorough book for the subject. The book also gives some history behind the trails as well. I was very pleased with this book.
2,Terribly disappointing,"This book gave so very little for the money. Probably my own fault that I bought this. Had I read the description more closely I would have realized that it was only 32 pages and 12 quilts. Of the 12 quilts in the book I only felt like 3 or 4 had the WOW! factor I was expecting as far as color. In comparison, the last quilt magazine I purchased had 82 pages and 15 quilts for less than $6. Would not recommend."
4,"Good, but not what I was looking for","I purchased this software solely for the bleaching. While this program can bleach files on your hard drive, it does nothing to bleach free space. So, files deleted before this program was installed can still potentially be on your disk. Since the technology is there, I don't see why this feature can't be added."
5,Good Program,I have used window washer for over 10 years. Works good for cleaning up & bleaching unwanted files. Works better then others I have used.I am happy with it.
2,Not satisfied.,"I purchased this product on Dec. 30, 2011. Althought it's supposed to be for a full year's license, on the screen it says it expires on 4/10/2011. That's only 4 1/2 months use on a purchase meant to be for 12 months. Under the circumstances, I would not purchase from this seller again."
4,Viva Los Seinfeld!!,"Concise, well thought-out and hilarious! This book is written in a way that the ""average reader"" can understand. Forget Cliff's Notes, this is a must have for students of Philosophy, television and everone in between!!"
2,There's something wrong with that.,"I suspect that the four and five star reviews below were written by the author(s) of this book under assumed aliases.There are some decent introductions to basic philosophical concepts here, but the writing is so inconsistent, juvenile, and painfully unfunny...The book could also use some editing (didn't anybody notice that each contributing author used the phrase ""yada yada yada""?)The opening essay by the book's editor compares Jerry to Socrates. And there are some funny, real paralells, which make it easier to digest the Socratic tenets imbued. But three contributing writers proceed to draw profiles of the other three main characters--and they are all painful stretches, as are most of the connections between Seinfeld and philosophy in this book. Further, most of the writers try to be funny, and they rarely are."
2,best of these type books,"but this is not saying mcuh because the rest are very bad. What each of these books needs are realy thoughtful thinkers who know philosophy, who i n this case know Seinfeld, and who have sense of humor to go with insights. Writers are dull, take themselves too seriously even when they have something okay to say."
3,The Frogger,"If what you're doing isn't working, then the exact opposite will have to work. (this is in Sein Langauge)"
5,What A Great Idea!,"It was my curiosity about the concept of such a book that initially led me to purchase this book. Being such a big fan of the show, I immediately saw a connection. Seinfeld is an excellent case study for philosophy. You could do a whole book on George alone. Like most case studies though, it is tough to find a 100% match to the underlying theories and models, but book does a great job in using the TV show to understand the wide range of philosophical topics discussed, and its a relatively easy read. My knowledge of philosophy is limitted to a couple of courses required in college many moons ago. Overall, I was delighted with the opprtunity the book provided me to refresh and re-discover philosophy."
2,"I can't believe, it's just a sitcom","This is one of the most stupid books I ever read. I like Seinfeld, but it isn't so deep. The opinions expressed in this book are terrible, really bad philosophy (done to teenagers or to people that think like teenagers during all their lifetime). This guys are looking for some fame and money. They could have written about astrology, life after death... pure mistification"
1,philosophy for american people,"this is one of the most disgusting things I have already seen. It's really cheap philosophy. This has no value, it won't change anything in the life of people that read it. Why shall we do philosophy. We can just watch TV"
4,Flawed but enjoyable,"It's real simple: if you're a fan of the show and are even moderately interested in philosophy, you'll like Seinfeld and Philosophy. This is a more enjoyable Philosophy 101 class. My only complaint is that they make a few factual errors-Mickey is not a Communist, for example. Notwithstanding this, I highly recommend the book. My favorite chapter was the one dissecting the ""Opposite"" episode. Don't listen to the negative reviews; get this book."
1,Not Even Close,"If you don't know much about Seinfeld or philosophy you might enjoy this book, but if you're a Seinfeld nut then avoid it at all costs. The show is incorrectly quoted several times and ""facts"" are also made up at times. The summarization of Socrates' allegory of the cave on page nine misstates some pretty major details. I suffered through the book until page 47 when the writer talks about how Kramer and Mickey embrace communism in the episode ""The Race."" Anyone who has seen that show even once knows that Mickey is trying to talk Kramer out of communism throughout the show. And even though Kramer definitely shows interest in communism it is quite a stretch to say is becomes an ""ardent"" communist. Rather than being an enjoyable read this book frustrated me enough that i quit on page 51. In all fairness the rest of the book may be excellent, but i'll probably never know."
2,"Lacking in Focus, Wild in Scope","While there are a few strong individual essays in Seinfeld and Philosophy, when taken as a whole, the book is a bit of a nightmare. Even excepting that some of the authors are advancing takes on philosophies that are far outside the mainstream, the essays too often fail to clearly make the philosophical point at hand. What is worse, it is clear that some of the authors -- William Irwin chief amongst them -- who simply do not understand Seinfeld, even within the context of the show itself. Far too flighty for the serious student of philosophy to treat it as a valuable resource, it is also too obtuse for the lay reader to gain a good amount of insight. What is worse by far, however, is that too few of the authors find a way to use the show to bring a lighter touch to their own writing of the material covered. I am not so much upset with the final product as I am disappointed, and I know I would not recommend this book to others."
5,Seinfeld and Philosophy,"Even if you're not yet a ""Seinfeld"" fanatic or don't know much about specific concepts of philosophy, this anthology does a great job of introducing you to both and integrating them well. The academic concepts are seriously explored, the connections made to the TV series are relevant, and it's all very enlightening reading without being simplistic. You can learn a lot from this relatively short anthology of explorations about much more than ""nothing."""
2,A book about nothing,"As both a Seinfeld fan and student of philosphy, I thought this would be an entertaining analysis on the long running sitcom. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver either in adequate depth to make an impression. Rather than an overarching theme, the book is a collection of essays--some of which are redundant as the book progresses. Beginning philosophy students might find it a fun introduction to the subject. But it adds little for those well-read in the field."
5,Very well written,"I quite enjoyed reading this book. Having an interest in philosophy as well as in Seinfeld, I decided to give this book a read and was very pleased with it. It provided good insite into the characters themselves and was even able to provide more understanding of the different philosophical theories (Kierkegaard and Kramer was especially interesting). I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in philosophy and Seinfeld or would like to know more about either of those. While it's not an educational book meant to teach, it's still a very interesting and fascinating read."
2,Waste your money,"hello all,this book really teaches you nothing, don't waste your money on this one, get a better book. any one can write this type of book."
2,"Good, but shoots itself in the foot","Lots of good ideas, but too much Anti-Microsoft drivel to be taken too seriously. I understand the authors may not like working with MS products, but it's too big a hole to leave out or dismiss it and the administrators who need to support Microsoft servers. The concepts are the same, just different paths to get there. It's a bit of a microcosm of the IT world: Lots of good info, but highlights the zealoted fools you'll have to navigate on your way to a real world working system. If you can't rationally see why Microsoft is in the server room (beyond dirty pool) then you're not as good at IT as you think you are."
2,A non technical book on system administration,"I'm surprised by the reviews of this item. They almost seem tohave been written by the authors' friends. Also I don't seewhy they refer negatively to Mark Burgess's great book Principles of Network and System Administration, which is adifferent kettle of fish -- more scientific and less touchyfeely. I like both books, but I prefer Burgess's more directapproach -- this book seemed to meander around all over."
2,Purely theoretical.,"This book is full of theories and advice, but it fails to mention any means of implementation."
5,Great Insight,"This book has great insight into the field. Starting out myself, I think this book describes clearly what it sets out to do and that it give you a framework for thinking. This book teaches how you should approach problems as an SA. This is valuable knowledge and I can imagine these basic principals get lost in the shuffle sometimes when things get busy. Tried and true advice from experts that know because they have been there.A good read for anyone at any level.Jeff"
5,Awesome!,"I agree with some of the worse reviews: This book addresses all the touchy-feely stuff not found in other manuals.That, however, is what it's for (It's plainly stated on the book! Read the friendly Meta-Manual!) and it <em>is</em> in fact a wonderfully lucidly written cornucopia of information in that field. It also is delightfully platform-independent, even if it is perceivable that the authors have a UNIX background (but which Sysad doesn't?).It's a simple fact that Sysads get other things wrong more often than the tech stuff: Communicating changes, seeing it all from the user's POV, negotiating (yes, they deal with salary, too), saying ""yes"" so that it isn't understood as ""yes to all""; saying ""no"" so that it isn't understood as ""fsck you!"".That's why we're often hated as arrogant BOfHs. This manual endeavours to fix that, and it just might succeed."
5,"A must have book for all sysadmins, regardless of OS!!","This book is long overdue in the System Administration (Sysadmin) world. And I hope that every serious sysadmin gets this book and uses it. While I don't agree with everything the authors says, my issues are minimum compared to all the great stuff.This book does not deal with how to install an OS and similiar low-level technical stuff. There are other good sysadmin books for that. This one deals with the non-technical side of sysadmining. Like the need to properly document how YOU install OSs, for instance.The only other works that come close to this one are the long out of pring ""Keys to Successfull Unix Systems Administration"" and the recent ""Principles of Network and System Administration"". I rate this work a little better then Burgess' work."
3,It's Okay - A Little Dated,This is a good book - not a great book. It iwll serve a purpose though. I am making parts of it required reading for my team and all new hires. The publication date is not that long ago but the material still seems a little dated.
3,Cable TV Technology by Eugene Bartlett,"The book was very useful, however I orginally bought the book in 1989 or 90 and used the information exstensively, however I beleive it to be somewhat outdated now. I know Eugene was writing an updated version at that time however I have not read any further books by Eugene. I didn't actually enter here to review this book. I was really hope to find an email address for Eugene. He and I work together as staff engineers at Tele-Media co. years ago and i was hoping to find him well and drop him a line."
5,A great overview,I'm new to Cable TV and work mainly on the software side. Two years of hearing the plant guys use decibels to describe coax runs led me to this book. This book is a great intro to the RF side of things. Note that while it isn't an EE level e-mag book it is not for the mathematically faint at heart.
5,Not love at first sight!,As soon as I read this story it went on my keeper shelf. Claribel isn't certain she likes Marc when she first meets him but that doesn't stop them from spending time together. It's fun to watch them fall in love! This is a fabulous Betty Neels read!
1,Horrible excuse for content filtering,"The problem I've had with the software is that once you setup a user and the user goes to a blocked site, it stops the browser from working altogether. You have to reboot the entire computer once a user tries to access a rejected site. This software is a waste of money. You should consider other alternative like CyberSitter. The technical support for this product is inferior as well. You have the option for pay-per-incident (which means you pay for technical support even though you already paid for the worthless product) or you can email tech support for free but it takes a minimum of 2 days to receive a reply and the quality of service through email is horrible. They don't even understand their own product. Buyer beware."
1,Net Security but at a HIGH cost,"Seeing is believing. Download the 15 day trail. You will encounter a user friendly program with lots of useful features... However, when it is running your internet speed will drop to a pathetic crawl. It's a nice program with lots of theoretical potential that is not functionally useful. Therefore, it is a waste of money and hard drive space. Programs should be judged based on usability not features. Two big thumbs down for Net Nanny."
1,Old and out dated.,"The product is old, out dated and not supported. After I installed the program I tried to go to some sights that it should block. The were. Then I went to google and searched for some sights. The first three it tried were not blocked. When I contacted the vendor they said that they were not updateing ver 5.0"
1,Is it my computer? Or the CD-rom?,"Hello, refering to the 5.0 net nanny version.This was a dud.It could be my 56k connection, or my slow intel celeron processor. But It crashed my computer many times during use. Did not work well."
2,Limited options,"I have been using NetNanny on 2 computers for over 6 months. I like the filtering and time restrictions, but thats where the pros end. The internet time usage feature does not work and customer support have not been able to offer any help. When I enable this feature the internet is totally blocked upon logging in. Also this program is an all or nothing program, meaning it completely blocks all internet use at the times you plug in, which maybe useful for a family with young children less than 8. Myself I prefer a program that will allow access to the inetrnet for specific programs that I allow for homework etc and then restricted all others. This is not possible with NetNanny at this time. This coupled with the non functioning options within the program and annual subscription rates prompted me to rate it at 2 stars. There are better options available"
1,Why Bother,"It might protect a 5 year old but after that, there are work arounds that are just too easy. crtl-alt-del buttons expose the software to deactivation. Or if you go to google, it does not prevent you from going to the picture or video sections. There must be better software solutions out there"
1,Slows down the computer!,The main problem with this software is that it boggs down the computer while you're surfing the net. Pages that used to come down in 3 seconds took 15 seconds or more to come down. I eventually just uninstalled it because it was driving my kid crazy. I bought CyberSitter instead and that's working great.
5,Spare Some Cutter Me Brothers,"Well my brothers the adventures of young Alex and his 'droogs' will have you incaptivated, shocked and amused forget the pseudo-intellectualisation of good and evil and the semantics of free will. From under-age sex to brutality and violence young Alex explores the whole gamut of depravity. As an English reviwer where the film of this great novel is still banned and Anthony Burgess is somewhat underlooked in literary circles his writing from historical novels to the eponymous Mr.Enderby collect dust in second hand book shops throughout this land. Like the author, live life as if it were a book rather than through a book, this is the gift 'A Clockwork Orange' represents rather than an over emphasisation of a moral duality....So what are you waiting for get clicking that mouse and order an adventure today."
5,The only game you'll ever need!,"This game has single handedly restored my faith in pc gaming. My PS2 is quietly gathering dust as we speak and I've been neglecting my girlfriend. Do I need to say anymore????Think Homeworld and add everything that you thought should have been in the game and then some. And when you join the online community, the game will simply blow you away.Basically, you control a ship (be it a combat ship, an engineering ship, a repair ship, a scout.....the list goes on) and have to conquer the galaxy against two other races. The beauty of the game is in its balance because in order for your race to be successful, you have to use all of the ships at your disposal.Make sure you've got plenty of spare time, because this game will be taking up all of it."
4,A pretty good day of Jazz,"For the price, this is one of the better box sets of Jazz that you can purchase. The morning and evening CD's are excellent and a pretty easy listen.The afternoon CD or Disc 2, just did not do it for me. It was a little too upbeat and at times made me think of Mambo. That being said, it is still a good CD to listen to.The great thing about these CD's are they are an inexspensive way for the novice Jazz listener to experience the many different styles and songs of this genre.Pick this CD up, it is well worth the [money]"
5,Amazing,"I'll keep this short. This game is fantastic...you may, however, need to bump the graphics settings down a bit for smoother gameplay. The other review says it all; but I will point out for his edification that you don't need to right-click to delete a waypoint, although it says that in the instructions. Just control click and the waypoint is deleted. No need for a fix there."
5,Fantastic Value for the Money,"I must have watched these on VHS a half dozen times. They were in full screen instead of wide as in the movies. With this collection you have director commentary, which wasn't possible in the VHS era. If you like Clint Eastwood as much as I do, this one's a keeper. When you think of all the good movies that followed Eastwood's career; this was his start in Hollywood. The last Dirty Hary movie, ""The Dead Pool"", is also available for a bargain price if you look for it. I remember watching a Dirty Harry marathon and discovered Eastwood was the fifth choice for the role. Frank Sinatra, Burt Renolds, John Wayne and Steve McQueen all turned down Dirty Harry! What might have been if one of them did take the role?!!"
4,This set...made my day.,"I also bought this set from Amazon, and mine came in a standard flip-case with two double-sided discs inside. The only real complaint is that they couldn't include the last Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool...true, it's gotten bad reviews and would have added a disc to the set, but it still would have been nice to have. Aside from that, the set is very nice: all four films have great transfers, strong sound, and good extras (a commentary for each one!).Dirty Harry: A rough, no-nonsense cop on the tail of a psycho-killer with changing M.O.sMagnum Force: Cops who murder perps before they can be put to justiceThe Enforcer: Harry and a young female partner against a radical group that has stolen military weaponsSudden Impact: A woman out for revenge in a small, quiet beach communityEach movie has its merits and pitfalls (especially the middle two), but they're all fun to watch."
5,Four Movies For The Price of One So Can't Complain,While I would've liked to have had the Dead Pool this will do just fine. It's great to have these 4 in one package. I don't understand however why they included previews of the Dead Pool and interviews with the acress from that movie but not the actual moie itself. Oh well 4 movies for this price and plus lots of extras make this a bargain.
5,cool!,"What else can you say about dirty harry movies. Awesome! My little nephews saw Clint Eastwood in one of his later movies and actually found him to be ""pretty cool for an older guy!"" So I ordered this collection and they found him to be even cooler! Great buy"
3,Great Movies; DVD Case Stinks,"If you're looking at Dirty Harry movies, you probably already know they're good movies. Amazon says 2 dvd's, but my set contains 4 dvd's with 1 movie per single-sided disc. The insert also says the movies are remastered. Good price. However, the DVD case stinks. The case has a single spindle with all 4 dvd's stacked on top of each other. Talk about built-in obsolescence and inconvenience! I've seen plenty of bad, poorly engineered dvd cases, but this one takes the prize. I transferred these dvd's to some good cases to avoid scratching/scuffing from stacking. Of course, that increased the cost. Annoying!"
5,Excellent,You'll definitely feel like a lucky punk when you get these 4 classic Eastwood flicks for a great price!
3,dirty harry,I may be old fashioned but I was shocked at the language and sex in these movies. I had seen all of these movies on television before and they had none of the soft porn in them. I liked the edited version of these movies much better and I could watch them with my grand children.
1,Horrible,Had to order this movie twice and both times the discs skipped. Couldnt even watch them. Dont order these.. Unless you want to send them back and get different ones several times. I gave up after 2 bad ones.
3,dust bowl,"Well put together history but too text book for my taste. I found it difficult to identify with the stories, More impersonal type of writing.Some really good pictures. I found ""The Worst Hard Times"" by Timothy Egan a much easier book to read."
5,Great Background...Scary Period in America,"Read this after reading the novel,The Happy Immortals, and doing a search on Amazon on the Dust Bowl to learn more about how it affected the Oklahoma Panhandle.This is a great account that reveals the background behind what happened.Accurate? Who knows.Interesting? You bet!Scary that it could happen again? Definitely!"
3,"Comprehensive, but a bit dry","I had to read this book for my American history class. It is a very comprehensive and insightful book about the Dust Bowl, but in not the usual historical way. It looks deeply into the environmental roots of the Dust Bowl and has some great photographs, both ecological and social. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who i s into environmental history. (But I'm not really, so it might be a bit dry and boring for those who aren't.)"
4,A sad lesson,Hopefully this book will help us to prevent the kind of disaster it describes in the future.
2,Doesn't look like its going to last long,"The ear phone is more confortble than it looks. Although its wire is very thin, I don't really think its going to last long... The telephone part doesn't have the Mute key. Just a Hold one, that's a shame. I got confused with the PDF from Plantronics. I'm giving 2 starts because of the price, volume capabilities and because its very small =]."
1,A Fool for Buying This Book,"This was an awful book. I normally like Fern Michaels, but this was almost unreadable. The main character was a despicable person - shrewish, nasty, petty and weak. She cried all the time, was mean to her father for no reason and had no backbone. In terms of the love story, it was just ridiculous. Olivia and her love interest, Jeff, were engaged inside of 2 weeks - the majority of the time of which was spent sleeping. Pretty much every evening ended with ""and Jeff was sound asleep on the couch when she got back into the room"". The story had so many holes in it, and was completely improbable. I wanted someone to just shake Olivia and tell her to stop acting like an idiot the whole time. To cap it all off, the writing style was juvenile and superficial. Overall, one of the worst books i have read in a long time. Do not let yourself be fooled too - avoid this one."
2,Disappointing,"This is my first selection from this author and I'm weary of choosing another book. I found the whole plot a little ridiculous. The writing style was not what I would have expected from someone who has published as many books as Fern Michaels has - maybe a first-time author, but not an established author. I think this book could have used a couple of edits before going to print, because it did have potential, but I won't be recommmending it to anyone."
1,I could not finish it!,"Oh wow is this a bad book. The main character Olivia is so unlikable I did not care what happened to her.She is nasty and rude! The story line on th jacket of the book sounded good. With such unlikable characters,including Olivia's dead mother who cares!!!!"
2,Finished,"Ok, so I love books, but not this one. It dragged on and on... The story is a cute one, but the writing is awful! I'm had a hard time concentrating and liking it at all (and I usually find the best in everything or at least good in everything).Also, the author doesn't know how to write dialogue very well. The conversations between the characters in the book are so unrealistic; I haven't heard anyone talk like that over the age of 3 or 4 years old. Very quick and to the point, not believable at all.Don't read this book, it is awful."
2,Poor Editing,"While I suppose the story line is good enough, the major bloopers in the audio book were very distracting. Supposedly the ring leader bank robber and deceased mother of our heroine, was named Allison Matthews. She married Dennis Lowell. Yet, at one point in the story, a baby bracelet is found that says ""Baby Matthews"". Since Allison and Dennis were married, the baby bracelet should have read ""Baby Lowell"". Shortly after this mistake, the audio book refers to Dennis as Dennis Matthews. Verrrrrrrrry distracting!!! I don't know if the written novel contains the same bloopers, but even if it does not, this is not a well-written novel. I agree that the minutia we had to hear about (related to Olivia Lowell's day to day, breath to breath, mundane chores) was boring to the point of frustration. I have enjoyed Fern Michaels' books in the past, so it leads me to wonder if this was one of her first novels that was just not published until later. Either that or the editor fell asleep at the wheel."
1,Not a good book.....,"I do not consider myself a literary expert, but this book seems really amateurish. This is not my first Fern Michaels' book, but I'm afraid it might be the last. I was disappointed from the early pages, and my disappointment never wavered till the end, and I'm surprised at myself for even getting there. It's the first book in a long time that I couldn't wait to finish. Sorry, Fern, for being so critical, but I really was very disappointed. I agree with most other comments, it does feel like a draft. And so many parts don't make sense...."
3,"Coffee, More Coffee and Dog Treats","I read this book on a day I was home sick. I got comfy in my recliner, cat on my lap, and read this book with the sun shining over my shoulder and iced tea by my side. This is a very light-hearted and fun book. I don't think there is much mystery here and the love story is the stuff out of junior high novels. BUT I read it and found myself liking Olivia and Jeff and hoping that everything will turn out well for these dog lovers. Just enjoy the book. An easy read with a fairy tale ending. However, the girl makes way too much coffee and she must spend a fortune for dog treats."
1,She Must Have Been Late on a Deadline,"This book reads more like a first draft than a finished product. Perhaps the author was late on her deadline. For example, the main character calls a near stranger at 11:00 at night and demands that he come over to discuss a dog, without much of an explanation of why she decided to do such an outlandish thing. Shortly after that, she loathes that she isn't assertive enough.This isn't the first book by Fern Michaels that had me asking myself why I am still slogging through it despite the dry delivery. Before, the plot was intriguing enough to keep me interested. This time, I should have stopped.This isn't the first book by Fern Michaels that had me asking myself why I am still slogging through it, despite the dry delivery. Before, the plot was intriguing enough to keep me interested. This time, I should have stopped."
3,Not too bad! Cute read!,"I found this book to be very enjoyable. I liked the characters. Although it was a bit predictable and even the characters seemed somewhat too good to be true, the story was still warm and sweet and compelling. I enjoyed it!"
1,foolish for attempting to read it,"This was my first Fern Michaels book and I was shocked at how bad it was. I know she has so many out there I will assume she's better than this. I have just started another one though and am still having a problem with her. Olivia, who has inheirited a fortune from a mother she never knew, whines and complains about what to do with the money she doesn't want. She is compelled to repay a debt for her mother and tries to track down 2 of her mothers old friends and accomplices in a bank heist. Why she does this is beyond me, the crime happened 40 years ago. Pay the money back and leave the other 2 women alone, give away the rest period end of story. Olivia is whiney, bitchy and very unlikeable. the dialog is tedious. I could not finish this book it was soooo bad."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I have read lots of Fern Michael's books, and I'm a huge fan, but this one I had to put down and leave it, before I even reached the 7th chapter. Just didn't care for the story at all."
3,"Great game, but flawed execution","EverQuest for Macintosh in its current form is somewhat flawed. While the core of the game is intact, there are serious technical problems with sound. Most people I know play with sound completely turned off to prevent bugs from cropping up. Those bugs can range anywhere from severe frame rate problems after playing for a while all the way on up to kernel panics that bring the whole operating system down.The most troubling aspect of all of this is not that the game was released with bugs. Quite frankly that is to be expected to some extent. The troubling part is that these bugs do not seem to be getting any attention from Sony Online Entertainment.If you're willing to play without sound it might be worth it to you, otherwise until they fix the bugs my recommendation would be to avoid this title."
1,Lousy Support,Never could get the game to run properly. Months of technical support contacts who could never figure out what was wrong. Wouldn't even refund my purchase price. SONY sucks. Will never buy another product from them. Good Luck with this one.
4,Magi-Cut File,"Top-notch product. Takes a lot of metal off, so be careful, but that's why I bought it."
4,Space Adventure in Another Galaxy,"This is one of the Christian sci-fi books that I loved as a pre-teen. The back cover reads, ""Nobody seems to know what's happened to him. Until two days ago his signal was coming through loud and clear, and then he... he just vanished! Zak Anderson, aged sixteen and a newly qualified space pilot, is determined to find his father -- missing in unexplored space. By a strange accident Zak and his friends find themselves in a far-off galaxy, on an unknown planet..""The planet ""Terran"" is what Earth would have been like without The Fall. Zak's space ship brings a copy of the Bible in its library, and they use it to expose the enemy in the new garden of Eden.Though written in 1984, the story line has not grown dusty and the ""science fiction"" aspect is still palatable. A fun adventure for children, with a clear presentation of the Gospel."
3,"A good book, but use it with care","This is a useful, detailed and interesting book, but it suffers from a number of defects as a practical travel guide. Firstly the layout is confusing, as the book is divided according to subject rather than location, which necessitates much cross-indexing and use of yellow stickies in order to find your way around (For instance, if you wish to visit La Paz you will find it in many different parts of the book, under such headings as accomodation, restaurants, camping etc). More disturbingly, the information on ""side trips"" contains many inaccuracies, as well as maps which can be feeble to the point of being misleading. Anyone who has tried exploring Baja by car knows that roads tend to turn into tracks, and tracks often disappear altogether. Good maps and clear information are essential if you want to avoid getting hopelessly lost. Maybe the trick is to take this book with you, but not to be too trusting."
2,"Weak comedies, horrible video","I like Edgar Kennedy in other movies but these are terrible. Unfunny, jokes that fall flat, cheap production values, many scenes that looked unrehearsed or poorly planned, etc. The transfers are terrible with muddy and fuzzy black and white and terrible audio. I didn't know these were from the Alpha company. Having mistakenly bought from them in the past, I can tell you that you should avoid anything coming from that company. They simply don't give a hoot about quality and their only interest is turning a buck over as quickly as possible."
5,Good sound; Great value,"I installed this in a conference room/film preview room with an Epson 822 and it makes a great combo! All our faculty are trying to book the room now. The center speaker is a bit heavy for the lightweight speaker brackets, but that speaker should be bigger. Very pleased and will purchase again!"
5,affordable performance,"These are very nice speakers for the money. The clarity of sound is outstanding especially on high frequency notes. Only downside to the speakers are low frequency notes, not as robust as I would like it. I still give the speakers 5 stars because the low frequency play is superior for the cost of speakers and more than adequately do the job."
5,Great bass & Excellent Satellites,"Had a Yamaha sys. prior, - no comparison to this Polk set-upVery good sound all around.jer"
4,"Great speakers, bad subwoofer","I ordered these over a year ago and then moved, landing them in storage until last week. I just unpacked them and got everything set up. I am disappointed, but it is too late now to return them.The speakers are great. Clear sound at every range I am likely to try, and they work beautifully for home DVD watching, which is what I bought them for. They are nicely sized and easy to hang. I highly recommend them for the speaker value.The subwoofer was a disappointment. It doesn't even look like it came from the same set. It is black instead of silver and had connections for only four speakers. I ended up combining the center with the left front."
4,Solid entry-level speakers from a great brand,"Even these low-end Polk speakers blow away the competitors. I can't believe the volume these tiny speakers push through without any hint of distortion. Only complaint is the subwoofer is a little weak.Overall, my rating depends on how much you paid for these speakers. 3-star if you paid the MSRP of $500, 4-star if you bought them at Amazon for $289, and 5-star if you bought them (like I did) at Fry's Outpost for only $199!"
5,Awesome for a budget minded system,"The Polk RM6750 speaker system gives you everything you need to put together a superior home theater system on a budget. We put a entertainment area in our basement with a 47"" 1080p LCD on the wall, Sony mid-range 7.1 A/V, and Samsung DVD/VCR combo, all coupled to the Polk RM6750 system (I will be adding 2 more Polk satellite speakers soon). For the size area the subwoofer and speakers put out high quality sound. We can really get that rumbled feeling in a action packed movie, or hear the tiny bell ring from a music CD. Total dollars spent on this complete system -- well let's just say my friends are impressed and think, I have over 5 fiqures into it. The Speakers and the HD TV make it Awesome!"
4,complicated but great fun once you learn,"This game is difficult to learn if you never played stratego and if you have played it it's still pretty wierd at first. but once you DO learn it's great entertainment, especially to those who like fantasy and roleplay. It's my personal favorite board game.one major downside i've found is that it seems to be very difficult to get all the expansions to this game."
3,disc slightly blimished,i always love the flintstones..back in the early 70's as a child i used to watch all the time and enjoyed them.
5,CLASSIC CARTOON,CLASSIC CARTOON The Flinstones The Complete Third Season I grew up watching the flintstones and i'm still a fan. I began getting the series on vhs from columbia house 20 vhs tapes.soon they switched to dvds. Columbia House didn't carry the rest of the series so when amazon got the series i started from the third season to the sixth season.My favorite character is pebbles and i like the gadgets.They don't make cartoons like this anymore.
5,The Flintstones all Volumes,I received all the DVD's as requested on time and in good shape. I grew up watching the Flintstones and loved them as did this time around.Way to go Amazon.Waiting for the other seasons of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea to come out.Thanks and keep up the good work
2,Mixed feelings,"The book was very informative though a bit dry for my taste but then again I'm not a scientist. I just wanted to know whether the hydrogen is the way to go in the nearest future, like tomorrow. Mr. Romm doesn't believe it is. I would agree with him but then again I'm not very well versed in the subject. But I'm going to be."
4,"Very thoughtful book, but complex","While its not the type of book that you could describe as exciting, the conclusions by Romm are well supported by his analysis of all the facets of hydrogen as a an energy medium. The chief conclusion being that hydrogen has a host of pitfalls, ranging from the fact that its really an energy transfer medium, expensive to make, to the major distribution and storage problems.It confirmed to me that beliefs of us being rescued from our impending energy dilemma by hydrogen vehicles are really off base.It is a much more professional and credible piece of work than Jeremy Rifkin's ""The Hydrogen Economy"" which so conveniently glossed over the same stumbling blocks for hydrogen's future that Romm dwells on."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book on this topic. It is well-informed and easy to read. Having done a little work with one of the named companies, it looks like the accuracy of the author is pretty good. A bit too much stuff about the debatable problems of global warming, but allowable as a soap box. Overall, excellent."
4,Clear that Romm gave this subject a lot of thought & study.,"I purchased two books on our energy future at the same time: Romm's book and ""Power to the People"" by Vaitheeswaran. Romm's book is by far the better one. It asks the questions and importantly does not blanche from giving you the complex and perhaps disappointing answers. The Vaitheeswaran book, on the other hand, asks the questions and gives no answers. Vaitheeswaran does provide a lot of uplifting examples of energy efficiency around the world. But just because something works in a remote Indian village doesn't mean it's the proper solution in a First World city. Romm's book is geared towards energy usage of the First World and does not suffer such short-sighted disconnect in reasoning."
4,"""Grabber""","This is a relatively inexpensive, but extremely useful ""tool""/aid for anyone needing assistance in reaching/grabbing items located in difficult places or merely out of reach."
2,Did not last long,"I have had one of these devices for about 3 years. It finally broke. I ordered another one & although it physically looks the same, the plastic is a different color. Not sure if the different color is also a different type of plastic. This one only lasted about 2 months until it broke. Very disappointed with the product. I will try a different type grabber/reacher."
5,Works perfect,"This is the third one I have bought. Not because there was a problem, but because they are so handy that I place them strategically around the house. Compared to the reachers that I have looked at in the local drug stores this is much more durable and funtional."
5,My first reacher. I like it.,"My reacher just arrived a few minutes ago. First let me say, YES you CAN pick up a penny with this thing, and NO it DOESN'T have to be on the carpet. I did it on the kitchen floor on the first try. I just used it to put laundry in the laundry basket and I will be using it to take laundry out of the washer and dryer. I just checked to see if I can take plates out of the dishwasher and it seems tricky but well within the ability of this product. The ability of this user is yet to be established though. hahaI'm very happy with my product. It appears to be able to do things that will exceed my post-surgical restrictions, therefore it exceeds my needs and expectations with flying colors."
5,Worth it!!,Very good product! Happy all around. Works like it is described. Great buy for what I was charged. I would recommend this to any of my friends.
4,Grabbers Are Great!,"We wouldn't want to live without this product. We've used this model for years, and we have these grabbers all over the house. They save our backs, but they're also handy for picking up things that fall into spaces too small for hand retrieval. We're especially thankful for our grabbers when there's something that we don't want to touch. These grabbers are sturdy and reasonably durable. After years of using six different grabbers, we have broken one internal handle and lost two, rubber-like pincer covers. These damaged grabbers are still in use; they just don't work as well as they did."
1,Please Read This,"First off the reacher is a very nice tool when it works but it has two rubber tips that actually do the grabbing. Without one or both of these it is useless. The tips are thin and just slide on and off and are very easy to loose which I did.I then went online to purchase another set of tips......NO LUCK. Next I emailed Medline customers service to purchase replacement tips, they emailed me back ""I'm sorry, we do not sell them separately""So now, I will throw this in the trash $25.00 gone."
2,"Nice Design, cheap Plastic","At first I loved this reacher- then after less than a month of use one of the grabber arms completely broke off! I am Very sad, as I really liked this reacher. I called Amazon.com and will be getting my money back, I really want to get another grabber, but am not happy that these do not last very long."
5,A must for a bad back!,This product works like a charm. It is also very well-made and durable in appearance. I am very excited about it. I think reducing the number of times you bend over helps avoid back episodes as mine always occur bending and lifting something silly like a shoe. It is also useful in getting things from tough places. The handle is not difficult to use at all. Good purchase at a good price!
5,I like it.,"Bought it for the wife to reach stuff on the top shelf - she just made me move stuff she uses to a lower shelf, and I never saw her use it.So.. when I was cleaning out the garage, I kept it handy for myself. It allowed me to reach over the other junk in the garage to the junk I was trying to reach to throw away. It works great and its sturdy.AND you don't have to bend over too far to pick up stuff off the floor."
1,"no can fixit, no parts available",This tool is extremely usefull for picking up various items when your poor balance and poor grabbing control due to neuropothy limit the ability to bend over and pick things up. This tool looses it's ability to pick things up when the rubber tips break off or are lost. I called MEDLINE several time thru customer servive but you think I was asking if cows flew!!! They HAD NO CLUE. All I wanted was replacement tips for their pick-up tool. Yes just two little rubber tips for their tool. AGAIN THEY HAD NO CLUE. DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. So the result is a great product but cannot fix it when broke!!!!
4,Almost the best,"If the spring is weakened and the ""fingers"" are covered with shrink tubing it becomes a very good tool."
4,purchase review for Merline Reacher.,Was please with medline Reacher. Was easy to use with arthritis. Received in good time. Very pleased with purchase. Thanks
2,Not Impressed,"I received this reacher as a gift when I broke my ankle and could not reach things very well. I find it very awkward to use and it feels clumsy. The very tip of the pick up part does not meet when you close the jaws, making it impossible to pick up very small items. It does not have a locking feature which is helpful sometimes. I purchased a ""Pik Stik"" which I find to be far superior. It has a gun type grip and it has the locking feature. It is strong with an aluminum shaft and the jaws grip well including the tips which close and allow small items to be picked up. It also comes in several lengths to suit your particular needs. The jaws can be rotated and locked increasing it's usefulness. The Pic Stik is also less expensive. I do NOT recommend the Medline reacher. Go for the Pic Stik and you'll be much happier with your choice."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I have had two of these Medline reachers. At first they seem like they are heavy duty, but I have broken both of mine with seemingly ordinary use, that is not trying to pick up things too heavy or too large for it. I use it exclusively in the kitchen to retrieve things I can't get with my PicStik.First of all, the rubber tips came off the first one, reducing its usefulness. A short time later one of the grabber arms broke.Since I liked the style of the device I bought a second one. In less than a year the plastic bar that you pull on to close the grippers cracked and pulled out of the bar that attaches to the grabber arms. Maybe I can scavenge enough parts from each to make one complete one.I have had other grabbers far longer that have not broken. It is too bad these Chinese-made grabbers are so cheaply built, because the design is useful to me."
3,Gripper/reacher/picker upper,For approx $10 more you can purchase The Golden Retriever Reacher which I have found to be more durable & longer lasting.
1,NOT SO GOOD!!,I broke this reacher the first wk I bought it:(:( My PIC-STIK is still on the road. Live and learn:(:(
1,Useless,"When installed, this program will not allow programs like Real Arcade to run, because they do something to the windows registry each time they run. That makes Child Safe useless to us, as our kids use Real Arcade a lot, and it is pretty safe (at least, we choose to trust it).I asked tech support if there was a work-around, and they didn't reply, except for an automatic acknowledgment of receipt.Two weeks later, I asked if they could reply please, and they didn't reply at all.So, the program really is useless. I uninstalled the whole thing and would have forgotten about it, but then I saw this listing on Amazon and had to comment."
3,Child Safe works but not on AOL,"I found it relatively simple to install and begin using. Definitely reveals the keystrokes, screen shots etc. at whatever settings you wish. And it is stealth without the password. However, not until I began using it, did I discover it is NOT compatable with AOL users or email. This means if you want the results to be emailed to you and you're an AOL member it won't forward the info. There was no indication of this on Amazon.com or the packaging. Not until I contacted the manufacturer. So, even though it works, it is useless for me."
5,Notum Wars Is a nice Booster.,"What can I say I like AO one of the best Online RPG's out there.Notum Wars is cool. You are able to build a tower to guard a point or x-road :) Or you can solo with a tower. Build one and pull mobs to the tower and it will boost your stats, or attack your enemies and help you take em out. There are lots of diffrent towers to to boost your stats or attacktowers. They lookawesome and they are :) I'll recomend Aanarchy to all. The game is not buggy anymore, but ya need a good PC to run it. You will find me near an tower and killing stuff :)"
4,Anarchy Online - Notum Wars,"With added content comes added textures. This booster pack adds alot of different items that make it feel more ""alive"". The towers and land control broke the 1 on 1 PvP barrier and introduced team vs. team PvP. I most warn people though, you need to have alot of RAM for this. With the ability of a player to customize their clothing, all towers looking different, etc. comes the need to have all these textures in memory. These textures are loaded once when they are first needed then stored in available memory for future usage. In some instances, while these textures load for the first time, there appears to be lag. Once they are in memory, everything moves very smoothly. If you are tired of the overwelming AD&D style games, this is for you!"
3,They never stop taking your money,If you decide to quit the game THEY WILL NOT STOP CHARGING YOUR ACCOUNT. Even after you ask them several times charges will cantinue to accrue on your charge card. You will have to tell your credit card company to stop accepting charges from them in order to get the charges to stop.Star Wars Galaxies is a lot more fun anyway.
2,How could you do this to me,"First the origional game is bugged. now the booster is riddled with bugs too. I crash all the time now, cannot target enemies, or otherwise do anthying other that listen to the [unimaginative] voices included in the game...... or look into the sky and watch the ship fly by (as my game crashes) Now granted Funcom will probably get around to fixing all the [buggy] errors in the booster now, but i though they would have better sence than to release ANOTHER bad product.On a good note though, the towers, when placed, look cool and except for the horrible lag, look like they will be fun to defend (or attack). All you have to do is wait patiently for FUncom to fix all the problems (although to be honest, i am not sure if I can wait again... 8("
2,Definitely not a circuits book,"This book is a collection of papers by various authors on random topics in wireless communications system design. By the title of this book I thought I was going to get a circuits book with actual circuit implementations. However, the treatment of actual hardware is essentially non-existent here."
2,Legalized robbery,"This is a textbook required by my university degree program. I know you have to spend money to make money, but this has gotten out of hand. Every single textbook is simply a reprint of a previous edition. Why then do they cost 10 to 20 times as much as a new non-textbook? The only answer is because the university is given generous financial gifts, which we used to cal bribes, by the textbook publishers.We're halfway through the summer semester and have yet to use one page out of this ""required"" book."
2,I didn't feel it correlated with my textbooks,"I felt like the assignments and questions inside this lab book were really difficult for me to do as a student because I couldn't find the information in any of the 3 textbooks we have. I didn't like the ""illustartions"" either. I would have preferred real photos."
1,bad glich,when playing the fourth level the game gliches freezes and the computer does not do anything the game won't hide or shrink and it frezes right before you can finsh the level so your stuck and you have to turn it off by the power button. the game is fun but it's like a trial.
1,auto barn false picture,Auto barn has and image of drilled Brembo rotors. When I purchased them they are not as shown thaey are normal type rotors not drilled. My mistake was not in opening the box when they arrived and not reading the fine print of the add. Much to my dismay to find out that Auto barn will not allow me to return them it was over their time limit.My fault and theirs I will not return.
5,very nice game.,"its hard at first but its a sweet game once you get to know it. the only downside is that the princess cannot fight(without cards). but oh well, its a great game!"
2,Not a real RPG,While at first this game was fun after a short while (4-5 hours) the amusment wore thin. I do not think this is a real RPG because you never get to make any important choices (or any choices for that mater). All you do is progress from one level to another. After you have beat all the levels you can go back and retry levels that you did poorly on.P.S. I know i have beaten the game.
3,its okay its nt that bad,Overall this game is pretty good i mean the overall game isnt so dark that you cant see where you are going but the most annoying thing is getting into battles. i mean you never know when you are going to get into one and they can come up out of no where. say u have just a tiny bit of health left and u are almost out of the level u suddenly get into battle and the annoying ripple effect doesnt help.the music is good but can be improved. 1 thing that could improve it was if the girl had always a primary weapon that you could use whenever you run out of cards during a battle. because if you do run out of cards during a battle all yo can do is lose. and the only place to save is at the world map at the beggining!! thats not that helpful you know what i mean. okay if i where you i would get this game but it still has some annoying features.
1,P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C,"When Lost Kingdoms came out, I rushed to blockbuster to rent it. I was very dissapointed. The gameplay was horrible compared to what it says you do on the back cover. You run around with cards that attack people, and I thought there would be animals you caught that you could use anytime instead of having a limit. This RPG is one of the worst games ever, so be hesitant when you purchase it."
1,THE WORST GAME IN HISTORY!!!,"This game is the worst. when i rented this game i was very disapointed because i wasted money and that money was not worth the game. If you hate RPG's, then you should not get this game.The gameplay also is not good,and also not being able to return to past stages plus the hard battles and collecting cards. The thing that I mostly hate about this game is the limited amount of times that you can use the cards. If you dont know this game read the discription and you will see what im talking about."
4,pretty good and pretty short,"Okay, I got this at blockbuster and was imediatly adicted (I always am when I get a new game). the gameplay was really good at first, but then I noticed that you run out of cards really fast and there's no way to get them back (Untill you get a cetain card) I found that extremly frustrating.Also, the controls are confusing at first then easy, after that the actual gameplay becomes confusing, with all the figuring out what card is what just by looking at a confusing picture.This game was really fun but waaaay too short. I had had it beat in under 2 days.Overall though, this game is very good and might last a while if you take it slowly and don't stay up all night playing it (Like me) You should probably get a used one too."
3,"Nice RPG, ends to quick",The gameplay is nice. It was like combining Final Fantasy and the card game Magic. The only bad part is that I have reached the end guy with less than 5 hours of game play. Definetly NOT worth the cash!
2,Dam,I got all this gamecube stuff but i was about to buy this game and after the reviews its a sloppy pokemon card gameDam i thought this game was cool for awhile but NO WAY
3,I don't know what I was thinking...,"When I was a young girl back in the 80's, I remember my Grandmother and my Great-Aunts raving about how comfy these shoes were. They wore these suckers every single day. I saw them here and thought, ""Oh, these will be cool for putzing around the house..."". I bought them in black and a size 10M. I got them in the mail, tried them on and they were too short AND too narrow (which is rare for me). I returned them and got another pair in a size 11W and they are still too crowded in the toes. I thought if I wore them for a while, they would stretch out, but they still rub me raw on the tops of my toes. I guess all I can say about these is that shoes have come a long way since Daniel Green starting making the Boca."
3,Beware - runs small,"These shoes run small. Suggest buying at least one size larger than normal. I wear 6-1/2 medium in an atheletic sneaker (Easy Spirit, Propet, Reabok). I Ordered this in a 7 medium and it is still too small for comfort. Otherwise a very nice looking and well made canvas shoe."
4,daniel green canvas shoe,"excellent service. very attractive and very comfortable. I like these shoes a lot. They are advertised as washable but I haven't tried to wash them yet so I don't know how that will work, which is why I rated them four stars instead of five. Note: these are canvas shoes so I don't recommend them for outdoors in cold weather (but obviously Amazon shoppers are intelligent enough to know that). If you wear canvas shoes indoors year-round, that is not an issue."
2,More fiction than history,"What a waste of my time and money! This is the authosr's second book that I read, and I beleive the last. If you like historical fiction this is not for you. I don't think the characters are well developed, she had a wonderful piece of history to work on and did not do it justice. As someone wrote here before maybe the author was influenced by Hollywood because the explosions and the involvement of women of the time ( especially a princess ) on the ""action packed"" part is somewhat unbelievable. Sometimes the book made me feel it was written for teens."
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this imaginative tale that 'explains' the fate of the two Princes in the Tower. It was very entertaining and I couldn't wait to finish the novel. The ending is a bit far fetched in my opinion, but that does not hinder this book's readability."
2,Clay baker,"I dislike this baker because it is made in Mexico at a time when so many Americans are out of work. It is a good product, but it is sold by greedy people"
5,Reco International 01132 Classic Romertopf 14 Pounds Clay Baker,"Awesome!! Totally satisfied with the price and the product, the shipping and the service."
3,Not for the impatient,"I have used ths about 4 times. The food usually eventually comes out good, in particularly roasted chicken, but it does not seem to save as much time as I thought it would. Twice I had to put chickens back in the oven that weren't done in middle, and I gave up on a corned beef and just cooked it the crock pot the following day. My expectations were high, so perhaps that is the reason for my dissapointment. But, I had read about a unique flavor the clay imparts... never tasted one.Also it is so large I have fill one half of the kitchen sink just below full to fit it in soak it. Checking on food is cumbersome as there are no handles, and it needs a very hot oven.Cleaning is not too bad if u let it sit over night in water.It is constructed well, but I'm just not a fan of the method. If your roasting mostly chickens, try the next size down, this one is overkill."
2,"Great movie, bad quality","I was so excited to order this movie, because it is one I grew up watching. When I got the DVD, though, the quality of the picture was grainy--almost like someone had copied it off a video tape. I wish I had ordered it from a different vendor."
3,"Good movie, but not as good as the first one.","While the Cameos are great and the performances by Miss piggy and Kermit are wonderful, the movie strikes as slow and adverage. Although it's very funny and the musical numbers are a riot, it doesn't live up to the processor, ""The Muppet Movie"". Charles Gordin is I have to admit, is hilarious as the Jewel theif who woos Piggy. Miss Piggy is pretty much the main charecter in this instead of Kermit and Fozzie the Bear. At least it isn't as bad as ""Muppet's take Mannhatain""!"
5,Great Movie and great price through Amazon.,"There is not much to say. I love this movie and so does my son, i like all the old school muppets movies."
5,Need a good laugh?,"This movie will keep you laughing the who way through. Every child and adult should see this. What a great way to spend family time. Another great from Jim Henson. Seller delivered quickly, movie works great. Couldn't be more satisfied would buy from you again. Thanks"
4,A cute movie,My family enjoyed this movie. This classic is much better than the recent Muppet movie that came out. No political agenda or message just a fun movie to watch.
5,Timeless classic,This movie brings up fond memories of my childhood and it makes my littles ones jump for joy when I put it on! My little girl can't get enough muppets!
5,Husbands Favorites!,I get all the Muppet movies for my husband. Every time we see one available for rent or buy we get it. :)
4,simple charger,i just simply wanted to get a lipo battery charged. this lipo charger does two or three cell lipos and it simple. compact. and it works. for the price i got just what i was needing. id like a hundred dollar charger but since i couldnt afford a big fancy do it all charger this little jewl takes care of my lipo battery just fine
2,Malfunctioning Charger,"This worked for the first few days I got it. Then, the lights started malfunctioning and eventually it wouldn't charge my battery anymore. I would not recommend this, as another reviewer also had issues with it charging his battery. This charger could just be not so durable. Look elsewhere for a lipo charger.PROS:-Comes with power supply-Very small and compact-Seems durable from the outsideCONS:-Known to have problems-Charging issues-Lights malfunctioning-Kind of Pricy"
5,Great value for $100,"Love them. I installed 2 about 150ft from the house in the backyard. We have them connected to a 200W receiver inside the house and can hear them from anywhere in the back. The sound quality is very good. I plan on adding a sub later on but do recommend purchasing one at the same time. The TIC subs have connections for L&R and then output to the L&R speakers. Installing them at the same time would have saved me from digging up the wires this spring. That said, I'm not sure the sub is necessary. I've very happy with the sound already. The lights are fairly bright and work as well or maybe better than most pathway lights. Highly recommend."
2,Overpriced,"I love my Biorb tanks, but the parts and filter packs are wayyyoverpriced. The 8 bucks shipping was ridiculous for two foam aristones that weighed less than an ounce and cost 6 bucks. I now adapt readilyavailable off the shelf foam air diffusers with some tubing pieces and they only cost about 2 dollars for a four pack."
3,over priced,This is a bit over priced for me compares to regular aquarium airstone. But I have to get it because I have biorb tank. It works fine. I have no complain about the quality of it
1,Disappointed,"I did not care for this shoe at all. It was not exactly the quality I expected, and it ran too small. I had to return it."
4,"Good Special, not an Episode, though","A very well-organized and appropriate video targeted at children age 3-10, maybe. Focused on exciting things kids can do, such as horse back riding, car racing...come to think of it, all slightly risky stuff. All done in an engaging way."
4,MY BOYS ARE READING,"I am amazed that my kids have jumped on this book and even offered to loan it to a teacher. Easy to read and funny as well this book has it all, in a way kids can understand. Each of my two boys has read and reread this self esteem guide for youn adult/ preteen."
5,Good read,Good book. Good lessons for my 7 year old. Love the series. She seems to have a temper and I'm trying to get her to get a handle on it now when she's young.
4,Great Series!!,"I have nothing else to say, except you should buy the entire series because it's great when working with elementary school age children."
5,Grandson Loves It!,"We bought this for our grandson's second birthday. He is fascinated with our neighborhood garbage truck and has to wave to the men every week. This toy is great! Very well made and durable. He loves playing with it especially pushing it on the tile (it zooms!) My 9 mo. old grandchild loves turning it upside down and pushing the wheels. I would highly recommend this toy.Flip 'n' Tip Fred5/25/2011-It is now over 3 years later and my grandson (9 mo. old) turned 4 this month and this garbage truck is still his favorite toy. He plays with it almost every day and even though he plays rough sometimes, this toy looks like the day we bought it. Love, love, love WOW toys."
2,loud LOud LOUD!!!!!!!! EAR SPLITTING!!!!,Great EXCEPT it is SO UNBELIEVABLY LOUD--you can not have a conversation while the kid is pushing it. Great except for that but I would not have bought it had I known that it was THAT loud. Did I mention how LOUD it was?
4,Fun toy!,"Fun, easy to use, versatile! My 4 year old loves it - from the many openings into the truck to the self-propelling motor. The cavity in the truck is also big enough for matchbox car activity too."
5,Fun,My 3 year old loves it.... He loves dump trucks right now. But like any toy he plays with it for one day then it sits for a week. Then he goes back to it. I like it it's perfect for a 2 - 4 year old. I think a 5 year old wouldn't like it as much.
5,"Super fun, well designed","My 3 yr twins received this for a birthday gift - they LOVE it! I liked that they can match the trash cans with the pictures on the truck, and also thought the feature of a gate to let the cans fall back out was pretty fun. I think it would have been cool if the trash can lids were actually hinged, but that's okay. Super durable. My husband really liked the ""engine"" sound it makes as you push it, but it is super loud and we often ask the boys to play with this truck down in the basement playroom because it is so loud when you push it fast - which my boys love to do."
2,So Loud!,"This toy is really well made, but it is way too loud. It isn't even tolerable as far as how loud it is. Much louder than the other Wow toy we have (cement mixer)."
3,tv shows,"This show was okay but not as good as the original movie. I liked the characters in it but the story lines were very weak and slow,and not as exiting."
3,Early Hugh Jackman Gem,"I've seen most of Hugh Jackman's work, but missed this mini-series, so I'm thrilled to add it to my collection."
2,Snowy River: The MacGregor Saga,"Not up to the quality of the original ""Man from Snowy River"". If you are looking for exciting horse races, don't. But I was thoroughly pleased to see that Hugh Jackman has a large part in all 3 episodes."
3,More insight needed,"Although this book is an fascinating look into the world of a homicide detective, it needed far more insight into Richard Overton's relationship with his wife. The book explains that early on in their marriage, Jan Overton knew her husband poisoned his first wife. She heard him confess to police. The book just glosses over this scene making no further mention of Jan's reaction to the disturbing information. The author gives no reason why Jan stayed with her husband many long years until her death. Was Jan Overton crippled by low self-esteem or mental illness? Why would she stay with a diabolic man? Was there more to the story? Like her husband, it seems she lived a double life. She was an outgoing school official with a terrible marital secret which tragically became her demise. Their relationship begs for more explanation and insight. This is where the book falls short."
3,good going gone,when i bought this i was expecting good quality and i got it.... for the first two uses. on the third use it broke
1,Busted After 20 Shots,"Being a big proprietor of Tippmann products, I was all gung-ho to get my new high quality remote line for the new season. Low and behold after about 20 dry-fire shots, the line busted with an ear-shattering pop, and was slowly leaking air. I've used other brand remote lines on my Tippmann A-5 before, I've just never owned one of my own. And those worked great. This however was a sore dissappointment from a great reliable company that I've come to love in my 8 1/2 years of playing paintball. Bottom Line: DO NOT BUY THIS REMOTE LINE. Tippmann's markers are about the only thing you can trust from them."
4,Functional remote line,"For those wondering, this is tippmann's H0-1 remote line, not the connex.This remote line works great if you know what you're doing. You will blow an o-ring out of the quick disconnect if the remote line isn't completely degassed. I have blown a few o-rings, but no use in complaining, you can get a 10 pack of any o-ring for a dollar. It's also hard to screw in the on/off asa to the rank. Other then that, I haven't had any problems yet. It acts as a great regulator for CO2. It has a solid build, I haven't had any leaks yet. I wish tippmann had provided instructions or some sort of owner's manual, even though usage is pretty self-exclamatory. I do not reccomend usage of a remote line to speedball players because it restricts mobility.Overall, the remote line is great, but 4 stars because there's nothing special about it."
1,Horrible,"This item is HORRIBLE ! It truly is very very durable and heavy duty, HOWEVER the second you connect the coil to the marker and your tank, it becomes so tangled up that you cant extend your gun. PERIOD."
4,"Heavy Duty, Durable but 1 Problem","I received this with my Tippmann 98 custom because I didn't want an extra 6-8 pounds on my gun from the CO2 tank. The wire is really durable and heavy duty. It will not break easily. I don't know how others are having problems with this line. I had no leaking problems at all. The problem is that it coils up when gas is running through it so you may need to break it in. I'm going to try that to see if it at least gets me a greater length. Anyways, you should get this because it's quick and easy to run this from your gun to your CO2 tank and, since it won't break and doesn't leak, it is great to have 6-8 pounds lifted from your arms."
4,"outstanding, innovative thriller","An outstanding introduction to the world of the Sensitives, who have the ability to ""sense"" the thoughts of others. Innovate thriller that blends sci-fi, espionage, and other genres together."
5,A Perfect Egg Pan,"I am not usually someone who goes to the trouble to write product reviews but I have, for years, been experimenting with different nonstick pans and own most of the major brands. Recently I purchased the 9 1/2 inch Scanpan. Not only is it somewhat lightweight compared to similar sized pans but, because of it's steeper sides, it actually has more cooking area than other pans of a larger diameter. Although I haven't been using metal utensils, I have spoken with other cooks who have and claim that, after years of use, their pans look like new. As for the nonstick surface: My stove is just bearly out of level. A few days ago, I was frying an egg. I put a small amount of butter in the pan and dropped in the egg. It started cooking and then actually slid, on its own, to the side of the pan.I have only owned this pan for a short while so I cannot personally attest to its long term durability but, for now, I absolutely love it."
3,"Pan is only 1.5"" deep, not 2.5""","This is the third Scanpan that I bought and returned to Amazon due to the incorrect measurement of depth that is listed on Amazon's website. The pan is only 1.5"" deep. It is a great looking pan in person with a mitt for the handle, but sadly not what I was expecting upon receiving it."
1,So very dissappointed,"I read reviews all over the place and was SO excited to get my new Scanpans. (I ordered several) They said you could use metal utensils, so I felt confident this pan would be better than my Favorite, Calphalon. NOT! We have never used anything but nylon, silicon, or wooden tools with our skillets, but within a year, the Scanpans have scratched and dinged in many, many places.I am SO disappointed with this product and am going back to Calphalon!Old Therin"
1,So terrible!,"I was so excited to get my new Scanpans... can use metal utensils, they said. Well, we only use nylon, silicon or wood. After just a year, they have pits and scratches all over the surface. Not good at all for the high price.I am going back to my old stand-by, Calphalon.Old Therin"
1,Non-stick Surface?,"Having read all the positive reviews, I couldn't wait to get one these pans. I finally received it yesterday and promptly washed it per the directions and decided to try frying up some eggs. What a disappointment! I preheated the pan as instructed, but this pan doesn't even match the performance of my Emeril cookware. I wish I could post pictures of the eggs that are stuck to the bottom of my pan. The pan's non-stick surface appears to be working now that the pan is cooling because the cooked on food is starting to peel up and looks to be easy to wipe out. The pan appears to be very well constructed, but I will return to frying my eggs in a dab of butter and appreciate the non-stick coating for its effectiveness when it's time to wash the dishes."
1,ScanPan Pans Made from PTFE,"The ScanPan pots are made from PTFE. So they can't call it ""green"" when PTFE is known to be a carcinogen. Stay away from ScanPan unless you want to cook your food on a carcinogenic surface. Don't buy any pots or pans that have PTFE, Teflon, or any such substance. Those synthetic chemicals cause cancer of the liver and kidneys in rodents. And the fumes of the PTFE at frying temperatures kill birds."
1,Over-rated and overpriced.,"Marketed with ""permanent non stick"" ability, truth is stranger than fiction when it comes to these Scanpan frying pans. The non-stick lasts no more than 3 months if you are a typical user. Was able to go no where fast calling their tech support number. They just kept me on hold forever and had to give up. Plus these pans contain PTFE in their non-stick coating, which is on the EPA list so buyer beware. Don't overpay as you will be stuck as I was outside of the 30 day Amazon return window, on hold forever."
2,Degrades a great deal with use,"I gave this pan a 5 star rating when I first started using it. I was looking for something instead of Teflon pans that I had to keep replacing as they degraded with use. Initially the pan performed beautifully. I noted, for example, how I had to chase eggs around the pan because my spatula pushed them rather than slipping under them. It was not much later, however, that I noticed that it did not cook omelets well. They tended to stick and I still needed my Teflon pan for those. Overtime the situation has gotten much worse. Now I need to use it as I would any ordinary pan with olive oil to keep things from sticking. It's still an ok regular pan, which is why I still give it two stars--an ok pan but no longer does what it is supposed to do."
1,Ms. Gewb,"Maybe the product has deteriorated since the last reviews; I bought mine a year ago and within a few months they looked like they were ten years old. I should have taken them back but didn't want the hassle of 'proving' they hadn't been mistreated. I followed all the rules despite this they look like crap, and even my bacon sticks when I cook it; how bad is that??! Maybe I'll go back to good 'ol cast iron. Would not recommend buying these."
4,excellent pan for so many things!,"Bought this as a smaller version of our other Scanpan Pro. Amazing surface as it is tough, super slippery, ridiculously easy to clean and yet also heats evenly and actually browns food! Only complaint is that unlike ""real"" omelet pans, the sides of this are more vertical than I would like. Photo doesn't really show that."
4,Very Good Pan but Some Issues,"This pan is truly non-stick and you do get a good sear. However, the side is very short and prone to spills if you are not careful. This is very close to a crepe pan. Further, it says you can use metal utensils but although it does not scratch through the surface, you can see fine lines in the area you were using them."
5,This pan is excellent!,"This pan is excellent! I love not having to use much, if any, fat when cooking in it. I don't recommend frying eggs in it cause they get a little rubbery, but plenty of other things are great like frozen gyoza, veggie burgers, shrimp, vegetables, chicken, etc. It's an especially great pan if you're looking to healthy-up your cooking. Take good care of it, don't scratch it, and wash it very gently with a small amount of soap. Keep it hung up (rather than in a cabinet with other pots and pans) and you should be quite happy with your purchase!! We've had ours for almost a year and have had no problems whatsoever."
2,It doesn't last very long,"I bought this pan about a year ago, and in the beginning it was great but after a year of moderate use it's surface becomes very sticky basically garbage. We did follow directions of heating it up slowly and washing it off while it was still warm, but again it lost all of it's non sticky properties. I really don't like buying products that don't last and I would never purchase another pan from scanpan."
5,Great omelet pan,"We bought a second one of this size as we use it so often and frequently want to make two omelets at the same time. The pan fits so well in your hand, well balanced with a very durable finsih. This is our forth scanpan, they are our favorite pans."
4,Full Motion Video Game from circa 1992,"It runs like a real movie using full motion MPEG 1 Video & how soon it ends depends on how acurate & quick you are to shoot the bad guys & not the good guys with your mouse or buy a light gun. You die if you ever get shot at once or kill an innocent. You get to continue from the last scene everytime you die up to 7x times. Acting is good or not too bad from actors. The stunt work & camer work & how it moves is great.Doesn't even need to install anything, works straight from CD. Only needs 266 mhz computer, win 95/98/Me/200/XP, 32 Ram, Direct X 8.0 with 16 bit disply & 16-bit sound card.I bought this from Buyerworld at Amazon Marketplace & works great on my XP. (I made sure I got the one that said it was XP compatible)"
2,Still Don't Know What I Want,"I found out a little more about myself as far as attitudes and personality (not much I didn't already know; just a litte reaffirming I guess to have gone over the exercises), but I still don't know what I want.The book may help you, or maybe not, place yourself into one of the six categories the author describes on why you want to change jobs. The book may also help you itemize your values, attitudes, change readiness, personality preferences, interests and skills into neat categories. The book does nothing in helping push you to finding gratifying work."
1,Very limited focus,"Terrible book IF you are not in the business world. There is almost nothing here that related to my situation. In fact, the only situations the author seems to know anything about are people in the 'white collar' business world. Virtually all of her real life examples are human resource 'professionals', finacial analysts, and others from the 'white collar' corporate world. In my case, I have a master's degree in English and have been driving a forklift in a book printing plant for 8 years, and apparently the author doesn't think factory workers yearn for other work situations. In fact, she probably has such a severe case of tunnel vision that she wouldn't think a factory worker might even want to read her book. This book might be a good book if you are a banker looking to make a career change--I don't know. But if you're not, save your money on this one."
2,Ok Book,"Definitely an easy read, guess thats a good thing/bad thing. Not sure it was really helpful, but did provide some insight. Not sure i would recommend to others to buy, but if you can find it in a library or something might be of some use."
1,I don't know what I want to do...this book didn't help,"I got this book in hopes it would help me figure out or discover what I should do. There are exercises, etc, but I got to probably the first 50 pages then skimmed the rest. I wasted an hour on it...I did not feel like wasting any more time on it. Maybe I should become a reviewer and help people stay away from bad books and products. Maybe this book did help?!?!"
5,Worth every penny,"Literally, I bought it for a penny. Of course, it had some wear and tear, but I knew what I was getting into. I wasn't buying a first edition Dickens, so I didn't care. Where else are you going to get a book for a penny?!"
4,"To find what you want, Understand Yourself first","This book may not help you find a life-long satisfying career, but IT WILL help you understand yourself much better. I found the exercises easy to complete, helpful and quite informative.The book will take you through a thorough self-assessment, and I like that you can get through the book quickly, but still put it down and pick it back up later when needed. When compared to similar books, this one is easier to navigate and is not at all painful.The author helps you categorize yourself into one (or several) of the following work situations: Where's the meaning, Been There Done that, Bruised and gun-shy (recently downsized), Bored and plateaued, Yearning to be on your own and One toe in the retirement pool.I have already recommended this book to two friends in the last week. While I simply checked a copy out of the library, I recommend this as a book worth purchasing."
3,It's okay.,"Like others have stated, it's a bit self-evident. She breaks down people into different groups, but chances are you don't fit in just one group and will need to read a few different chapters. Even there, it seems she assumes certain things, such as people wanting a 'traditional' job or start their own business, but that's it. No options it seems for stay at home moms, self learners, create your own world or anything out of the 'norm'.It's okay. Just not great or very inciteful. Basic beginner book."
2,Over-rated,I can't believe how many people are giving this 5 stars. The various exercises are simplistic and redundant. Not much practical advise or information. I'm glad I only paid $0.97.Not recommended.
2,Not that good,"Author was in the right track, but just didn't write it very well. He tends to jump all over the place instead of focusing on one thing at a time. Shortcuts section in the back is very good though."
5,Great book for beginners!,"I'm currently on chapter 5 and have to say this is a great book if you're just starting out with Pro Tools. Some of the information is pretty basic in the beginning, but it really gives you a good grasp on what's going on. Plus the examples from the book are great practice and learning tools. I'll probably be looking for more of Mr. Hagerman's books when I'm finished with this one."
4,Pro Tools Ignite 7,"This is my favorite of the books I have seen for Pro Tools LE styled rig. There are a couple others and this one is easier to use. Quite straightforward. Every text seems to have its unique ways to show the reader some cool shortcuts and this one is no different. That point is neither here nor there really. Besides, if you just want the shortcuts I think Digidesign still prints a laminated sheet out for the consumer.There, howver, is one forseeable problem with the Ignite series. The obvious issue that Digidesign moves its software versions so rapidly that you may easily buy a guide that will only be current for 4-6 months. I think there has been a Ignite 6.7 an Ignite 6.9 and now the Ignite 7.0....But hey, you gotta pick up the knowledge somehow and sometime. Plus the 7 Series is the way to go if you want to use the current ""MIDI Track"" configuration. A whole lot has changed since the days of ""Pro Tools 6.-""This is a good book at an affordable price."
5,a GREAT storyline..,"I don't know about you, but storyline and gameplay is the most important aspect of the game to me. Good music and graphics are a plus but it doesn't make or break a game.I played the Super Nintendo version and the storyline is amazing. Keep in mind this is a pretty old game and it's not like the Final Fantasy games you might have played. It's a little slow and pretty difficult but when you beat the game, you will not feel disappointed.There are 3 possible endings depending on how you play the game. There's also a dozen characters to choose from and lots of secrets. In your Township, you can combine your characters with elemental shamans to give them new skills and abilities as well as make recipes and rest up.Let's just say if you liked the old Final Fantasy games on SNES, you will LOVE this game. Almost the exact same thing."
1,Dissapointing,"I bought Breath of Fire 1 and I admit, it was one of the best experiences ever. It was fresh and innovative. The graphics could have been better, but it was still an epic adventure you can't miss. But little did I know, the second installment, I guessed would be the best game ever but I was mistaken, the graphics are worse and are reinforced by a terrible storyline not even relevant to the first. In fact the cinematics are poor and the battle sequences have done nothing but become more blurry and the special effects have dropped. What's happening? Never buy this game. honestly!"
1,THIS GAME [stinks],It has no gameplay at all. The graphics are horrible. The music is abhorrent. Spend your money on something better than this.
2,Not as good as BOF 1,"I started out by playing Breath of Fire III on playstation, loved it. BOF4 on playstation, loved it. got BOF 1 on gameboy advance, it was fun, but now BOF 2 disappointed the ... . I'm sorry, capcom, but maybe you should be more choosy when it comes to translating titles from platform to platform. Maybe this game would have held my attention, had i not bought Golden Sun. Breath of Fire 1 pales in comparison."
5,Informed and Thoughtful,"The Afterword alone is worth the price of the book. Rarely does a thinker with the acumen of Rheingold also exhibit a willingness to re-examine, refine, and, on occasion, reverse positions taken a decade or more ago. Rheingold does in a way that is informative and mind-opening. Aside from the mound of solid information and provocative observations about the Internet in human life, Rheingold's prose is as comfortable and welcoming as those toes tucked into the grass as he composes on his laptop. A must read."
4,"A smart, sexy look at life in LA","Great fun from start to finish...Even more so, because it gives insight into how guys really think and how badly they behave. The Idiot Dance is fast paced and a terrific read."
1,No lo recomiendo,"Buenos dias, la razon por lo que no lo recomiendo es porque no funciono y les escribi preguntandoles y no obtuve respuesta a mi peticion, en otras palabras la bomba no chupa el agua......no funciona"
4,Works great,"Compared to other siphons, I like this one because of the pump. The material it is made of is not the most durable when compared to the other siphons. Since I only use it every other week, I don't think that durabilty will be an issue. I saw this item at some of the big chain stores for a much cheaper price."
4,"Good pump, long hose","The pump is great, easy to use, but the hose was much too long for my use. I ought to have looked into the specs more before I bought it. The suction is also a bit too fast for my small tank, though the grill on the end has yet to let a rock seep through. Overall does what it says it will do."
2,"Not the same as picture, but it is Siphon","When I got back from class today I found a HUGE grey/white bag waiting for me at the door. I opened it to find a Siphon Cleaner as it says on the tag...it's not the same one as the picture above (it's a Chinese knockoff), also it's really BIG! I guess it would be great for huge tanks...a lot bigger than mine anyway. But I got a free feeder (they sent it to me at first, then sent the correct item, they did not want the feeder back.) so I can't really complain.Here are pictures of the item I received in the mail.UPDATE: Amazon took off my links so I'm going to try and post it in the image thing above.My laptop is a 14"" so you can kind of tell the size of the thing."
1,Not accurate,"I tested the thermometer in a pan of boiling water and it was off by 7 degrees. Then, when making candy, it was off wildly against an accurate digital thermometer, as much as 20 degrees too low. It is useless. I used the digital thermometer and the candy came out perfectly."
1,Poor readings,"I thought the thermometer was calibrated incorrectly because it was reading 30F too low. It turns out that the metal body of the thermometer is losing heat from the toffee solution (few cm high). The readings were more accurate when I lay the thermometer flat in the toffee, but part of the reason I use a thermometer is so I don't have to do something crazy like stick my whole hand in a hotter than steam pot. I preferred my old glass thermometer. It was breakable (eventually broke) and a little slow, but the readings made sense."
1,Deep fry Thermometer,"Hand washed this thermometer once and the lens inside fogged up, not happy with it, found a nice thermometer at Costco for less than half the price."
1,Disappointed,"Wow... All I wanted was a simple candy thermometer, one that wasn't glass or digital. I have meat thermometers that can be calibrated to 0 or 212 degrees, but not this little gem. I went ahead and started a batch of caramel w/o checking the thermometer's accuracy (a mistake I'll never make again), and positioned the red marker to 230, clipped it to my pan and went for it! I knew I was in trouble when the reading during the boil was 115, then it never went past 210, dropped several times, so I pulled it out and eyeballed it, which is imperfect, prompting me to seek a thermometer in the first place. I thought I'd be able to calibrate it by adjusting a nut or something on the bottom, but you can't. Digital probe thermometers are great, but they don't last, and the glass thermometers are too fragile for me, so I thought this would work, I guess I'll have to keep looking."
2,Hard to use,"Although the thermometer may work well, the clip prohibits it from doing so properly. It won't clip to the side of the pan so that it rests and stands up the way it should."
2,Software doesn't want to work,"Just received this as a Christmas present... I've tried the CD in 2 different computers, one with XP Home and the other XP Pro. Both have trouble reading it - it doesn't autorun, and I can't even ""explore"" to the files. I'm downloading the software to try this out, but it's trial software and I can't find a product key anywhere in the packaging with the CD and remote. Maybe I just got a bad disc? Help!"
5,Snaptastic!,"Every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to. The Snapstream remote is one of them.I just recently built a home theater pc through which I play music and movies. However, the HTPC is in a different room than my projector and I needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room. I chose the Snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased.I also highly recommend the Snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the Beyond TV PVR solution. I record all my favorite TV programs on my HTPC in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the Snapstream remote.This is one product that I can recommend with no reservations."
1,DEAD!!!!,"Like several others, I bought this, and it worked great for several months. Then one day my computer said it found new hardware... but that it couldn't identify it. As it turns out, the receiver had died. I borrowed a receiver from a friend, and it worked great. His still is working at the time I write this, but mine is quite dead with no help from Snapstream."
1,Pathetic Customer Service,I bought a new SnapStream Firefly PC Remote recently. I could not get it to update the software and work with foobar2000. There was an initial acknowledgement of my support request but no reply despite a further request. So the remote is basically useless for me and a waste of money. Beware
1,poor product and service,"1 star because there is no Zero Star rating.Buyer beware! what you see is not what you get. Picture shown an OEM battery, but actual product I got in the mail is a knock off. Do not use it with Fujifilm 4900. Fully charged it only took 5-6 pictures and battery goes dead. Same form factor but different voltage and current ratings. Emailed seller with tech question with no response for 3 week, finally left feedback on Amazon, seller immediately respond said I did not send email, with defensive attitude. I have proof from Amazon auto-respond indicating my email was sent. Will not buy again from this seller."
5,Best Travel Guide to Moscow,"If you go to Moscow, buy this book. It singlehandedly guided me through my trip. Excellent guide to the sites as well as a fantastic short history of Russia at the end. The only problem with the book was its lack of reasonably priced restaraunts, but then agian, I'm not sure if they exist in Moscow. PS I highly recommend anyone taking a trip to Moscow"
5,Rough Guide: Moscow,"This book gives ou a nice overview of the region, and incredible specific tips for visiting Moscow."
1,Not worth the paper written on,"As a las vegas lawyer, i traveled to moscow many times, and I purchased this book. This book is so out of date, it is not worth the room in your luggage."
5,Awesome Roaster,"This is an excellent heavy cast aluminum dutch roaster that cooks to juicy perfection. The first meat I cooked with this was a chicken roaster and it came out succulent and tender. It even browned very well with the lid off for 10 to 15 minutes. I'm very happy with this product and plan to cook many more meals with this. So if you are looking for cookware that delivers juicy and tender meat, this is it! Oh and it cleaned up quick and easy also."
4,"A Lesson in ""Come-Uppance""","This story is about Meriath, an arrogant goddess who angers a god stronger than her and is ""put in her place"" by him. There are three ""mini-stories"" in the book where she becomes mortal and is cursed to ""serve"" the first man she sees at all times. She at times is treated cruelly by the men around her, but in the end the men who deserve it get their ""just desserts.""I found this story fascinating and was unable to put it down until I finished it. I loved the ending. I have yet to read any of Ms Green's other stories, but found her to be an entertaining author on this one."
2,Willful goddess learns lessons in humility and beauty.,I have read just about everything Sharon Green has written She does better when she sticks to fantasy fiction. I found Haughty Spirit contrived and predictable. I was surprised to learn that this book was considered erotica. It is just a mediocre attempt at selling sex with little story.
4,A good read!,"The novel was Sharon's first attempt at writing for a certain ""specific"" audience. It was not, in my opinion, written for the sex as much as it was for the discipline and D/S aspect. I believe this for several reasons but mostly because the company that published it focuses on the D/S genre.I enjoyed the book and I found the discipline scenes very hot. There were a few scenes that jump to mind immedietely as excellent. It may not be her best Fantasy work, but I've reread it quite a few times and I still enjoy it."
3,Catastrophism Is Not About Catastrophes,"The book is about the PHILOSOPHY of catastrophism, not about ""Asteroids, Comets, and other Dynamic Events in Earth History"" as the subtitle implies. It is mostly about the currently outmoded theories of the influence of catastrophies on development of the Earth, and the people who espoused these views. No real data, not much currently constructive synthesis. But lots of good history and references if that is what you want."
5,Please create an audio abridged version,"To the publisher I would appreciate it if the publisher could produce an audio adaptation of this book. I would love to listen to this while I drive to work and to let my 16 month old son listen to it as a bedtime story. My goal is to expose him to some of my favorite passions, maths, sciences, physics, geophysics, paleontology, astronomy, electronics, photonics, new science and discoveries etc. The more audio books you can produce of the above genre the more I will support you. Arnold D Veness"
5,Real Best,"This compilation is really exceptional, most notably the presence of Art Of Life in its entire version. Truly the fans' choice.Who could disagree with this setlist ? these are undoubtly the 12 best X Japan's songs or almost. I can't think of any that would better replace one of those.A must have if you can buy only one X Japan album."
2,disappointing,"it's hard to buy some albums of X in U.S. and most of albums I found via Amazon.Japan cannot be shipped to addresses outside of Japan.Among kind of few albums I can choose, it's just something below average.lots songs in the albums sounds odd and kind of different with ones I hear somewhere else.very disappointing."
2,Dumb decision making in order to stay clear of bad guys,"I didn't like this book very much. I tried. I like much of the old Patricia Potter books, but this era isn't makeing the grade. There were so many repetive thoughts of whether the phone being bugged, people diving in front of others to ""save"" them, oh my goodness a horse being shot ( I have four horses so it was just how the event was overwritten), making dumb mistakes when there are bad guys out trying, maybe, kinda trying to kill people. If the author took out the references to the above the book would have been much shorter.There was too much telling and convincing words instead of a real story. Save your hard earned money for a better book."
5,Lady Legend,"I have just discovered Ms. Camp's books and I have been busy reading each one of them! Lady Legend is one of my favorites. The story takes pace during a very turbulent time in America and in the West. Lady Legend has it all - great main characters, great secondary characters, action, romance and tragedy. I highly recommend this book and will be busy reading all the rest of Ms. Camp's books!"
4,A fine scary novel,"Like most of Campbell's fiction THE HUNGRY MOON is a tour de force of atmospheric weird horror. At the same time Campbell has crafted here a biting satire on religion, and particularly the troubling ease with which panic and hysteria, acting on a population, can breed mindless fanaticism within supposedly civilized society. Overall, THE HUNGRY MOON doesn't quite impress the reader as strongly as Campbell's most masterful works--for novels, see INCARNATE and THE INFLUENCE--but neither does this book in any way discredit Campbell's reputation as one of horror fiction's most extraordinary talents."
4,A Great Start,"Knight takes the vampire legend and blends it with a science fiction premise. The story is set about 100 years in the future. Knight uses a nice trick in having his main character receive a classical education from a man of the cloth. That allows Knight to make 20th Century cultural references via his character that would be otherwise implausible. The bad guys are Kurians, aliens that have learned to extend their lives indefinitely by drawing ""vital essence"" from living creatures. The more intelligent the creature is, the more vital aura it has. This is why the Kurians invaded Earth to get at the human herd. The pace is quick, and Knight does a nice job with detail. I found the main character to be a little unlikeable - I accept Knight's premise that Valentine (the point of view character) has had a rough life, but it was hard to empathize with Valentine.I look forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy.Richhttp://www.drgames.org"
5,A great mix of science fiction and horror,"Fabulous setting descriptions and nightmarish aliens help set the stage for character growth in a world decimated by plague and technological collapse. Ripe for the pickings by a bunch of aliens from whom the vampire legends sprung...except these guys are real and we're all so much cattle to them. This is almost like a post-holocaust earth, with buckskin-dressed resistance fighters running through moldering ruins of today's cities. It's a great read if you like a blend of adventure and characterization as a young resistance fighter rises through the ranks."
4,Novel genre and runs with it,"The idea that there must be something to the Vampire mythology that exists throughout history in pretty much all cultures in one form or another is thought provoking, and Knight takes that theme and unravels it in a post-apocalyptic scenario. Solid job at blending action with character development. Good research and description on locations, and technical extrapolations from an apparently well rounded knowledge of weapons, military workings and social mechanisms. Overall good read. And, Knight also does a surprisingly good job of keeping it interesting through the entire series."
3,Disjointed first half of the book drags this one down,"The first chapter had nothing to do with the rest of the book and the next eight didn't have much to do with each other either. After Valentine meets with the Carlsons though, the story picks up and is continuous throughout.Overall it was a quick fun read, and I hope the next books keep a more linear storyline like this one ended with."
3,NOOOOOO!,"I really wanted to like this book, I love Horror and I love SciFi and I love apocalyptic novels, but this one falls short in every catagory.It was too choppy for me, not enough description or character development especially for a first book in a series. It just wasnt enough to make me keep reading the series."
1,It's....meh...,"Well, not to hate on this book...but I made it to page 66, and it was not a smooth ride. I was interested by the story line when I saw this book in Barnes and Nobles, but now I wish I could get my money back. It had do real depth or interesting happenings that encaptured its reader. Given I have only made it a short way through the book, yet I am not going to torture myself anymore...I was in denial for a while, hoping that something big and exiting would happen, bit it didn't...I am used to character development like Paul Atreides in Frank Hurberts ""Dune"". When compared with a master sci-fi writer like Frank this seems like a childs book.I say: Why spend the same amount of money on Vampire earth as Dune when Dune will give the reader infinitely more pleasure? I do not reccomend this book to any reader who is in search of a deep, meaningfull, developing, and enlightening story...I hate being negative...but sadly that's the reality."
3,VAMPIRE EARTH SPINS NEW THREADS!,"I absolutely loved the overall ideas for this new series. I liked the setting, the characters, etc... But I think it fell short in a few areas.Still, all in all, it was an interesting and thought-provoking debut novel. I would try it again, but I hope the vampires are more drawn out in the next one. Not 1 vampire was introduced as a main staple character, either good or bad or otherwise.And that was what was really needed here, I thought.Like Brian Lumley's vampire series! They are as well known as the humans that battle them.That's what this series needs."
3,A Lackluster Start to a Great Series,"I came to Way of the Wolf by a round-about path. I had read the first four books of EE Knight's Dragons series (which is excellent in every way, but that's another story), and was of course interested in his other series.Unfortunately, Way of the Wolf was not so hot. I wonder how old Knight was when he first wrote it, but didn't care enough to go find out. (Mid-teens would be my guess.) Characterizations were all too frequently flat-out plummy descriptions, and characters were 2-dimensional.If I had stopped at this book, I would never have bothered to write a review... But I didn't. I read the next book. And the next. And... And I have to say that you can watch the writer and the world concept grow by leaps and bounds as you go on.This may not be a great book. But it is the start to a great series."
1,Waste of Paper,"When I originally heard of this series I thought that it would be one that I'd liked, however after reading the first one, The Way Of The Wolf, I'm greatly disappointed.Knight creates an interesting and somewhat unique idea for a world, and borrows from Lovecraft somewhat, which is a good start. However he spends way too much time giving you background info over and over again. There's no character development at all. In fact the main character Valentine has no real personality and is very one dimensional. Overall there is no real plot to this story, it is a series of episodes spliced together and when you think he's going to start taking it beyond the training sessions or background info but it always ends too soon.A story that goes no where."
4,Very impressive new author,"I was very impressed with this book and the author. It appears that a lot of research has gone into this book. I get tired of the ""same old vampire"" books... I thought that everything had been used. I was wrong. ""Way of the Wolf"" is very unique. I could not put the book down.I was not impressed with the description on the back of the book... but I am glad that I bought the book. Now I want to know what will happen next... and can't wait for the next book."
5,"I don't read Science Fiction, but I enjoyed this book.","I bought Way of the Wolf because I loved E.E.Knight's Age of Fire series so much. I dove in with a lot of trepidation, fully expecting to find it as boring and dry as I'd found other Sci-fi books. Instead, I discovered vampires magic and even shapeshifting gods! I am hooked. This is no ordinary Sci-fi!If you dig science fiction, horror, or western adventure, you'll dig this book."
4,Congrats to Mr. Knight,I won't bore you with a long review. A nice read with a believable main character. Looking forward to the sequel in May of 2004.
2,I returned this book.,"I like vampire books, military sci/fi, and apocalyptic struggle. By the cover I had bought the book. I had wanted to like the book but I couldn't connect with any of the characters nor the world.I gave it two stars because I wanted to like it."
3,Don't Beleive the Book Blurb,"This book surprised me. After reading the strange discription on Amazon I just about passed this up. I picked up a copy to give it a try (I liked the cover art).I am very happy I did. A nice twist on the Vampire genre, The idea behind the book was intriguing. The book was a enjoyable read and gave us a horrible vison of the world 60 years in our future.I don't regret reading the book and am excitedly awaiting the second installment."
5,Delicious!,"Two tablespoons of this curry and a can of coconut milk is all you need to make the tastiest, most fragrant sauce!"
3,so-so,"Very hot, but not very flavourful, quite bland in fact. It should have been expected for such a low price item."
4,Yum,"Great curry paste. Excellent add to any dish that needs that extra oomph. Only 4 stars because the packaging is annoying, I had to empty the paste from the Baggie into the tub for better storage."
5,"Authentic, vegetarian curry!","I love gang karee (yellow curry) but most store bought curry's have fish sauce in them. Luckily, I found this one a few years ago and have since made several purchases of it. It is delicious! It has all of the essential and hard to find ingredients to make Thai style curry at home. There are many different ways you can use this paste. One of my favorites is to saute tofu, sweet potatoes, carrots, onions, and/or garbonzo beans, add a heaping spoon of yellow curry and a can of coconut milk for a delicious, healthy, vegetarian curry. It has the perfect amount of heat for us, and we like things pretty spicy. One container lasts awhile, just stick it in your fridge for storage. It's so convenient ordering this online, I've had a hard time finding it in stores and I'm glad Amazon keeps it in stock."
5,Easy to use Curry paste,I have a hard time finding Yellow curry paste and this one worked great. It's super easy to use with alot of robust flavor. I used it to with 3 heaping tablespoons of the paste and one can of coconut milk. Just add to chicken and sweet potatoes over rice. The flavor of the paste was strong with some spice/heat to it.
3,"Disappointing, but better than some...","This book was recommended to me as a good resource for learning Arabic, but after a thorough review of it, I went back to the resources that I already owned. This book is not designed for the truly neophite Arabic student, even though the title and introduction would lead one to believe that. One of the most obvious shortcomings of the book is the tiny font of the printing, which often makes it difficult for the student, who is not familiar with Arabic, to differentiate the new letters & symbols. One advantage of the book is that there are exercises at the end of each section, even though they are more geared for a classroom, not for an individual learner. ""The Arabic Alphabet: How to Read & Write It"" by Nicholas Awde & Putros Samano, is a much better beginning resource for the complete beginner."
2,NOT FOR SELF TEACHERS,THIS IS NOT A BEGINNING BOOK FOR SELF TEACHERS AND FOCUS IS ON THE ABC'S NOT SPEAKING AND PHONICS.
5,Great progressive learning system,"What a book!! Not only will you learn fingerstyle blues, but you'll also find yourself picking up the common chord progressions and turn-arounds associated with blues guitar. I am also reading Fretboard Logic, and it's amazing to see how this book compliments the CAGED system. So while you're stepping through your chordal exercises, you can learn some great tunes. The earlier songs are perfect for a beginner and gradually increase in complexity up to the Rober Johnson classics. Quite the goal, keeping you motivated to practice."
5,Good book and serving its purpose well!,This is an excellent way to approach a new or different style of guitar play. Also great for going back to the roots of the genre!
3,Not really a beginner's guide.,"I've only recently started playing the guitar but had an interest in this style of guitar playing. While the first 10 pages or so are very informative I do not as yet have enough training to jump over to the ""blues"" guitar. I'm guessing someone with more experience would get more out of this book. It comes with a CD which I haven't looked at yet."
5,This book is AWESOME,"Just to expand a little on what previous reviewes have said, this is an excellant book! I purchased it based upon some reviews at acousticguitar.com and am totally satisfied.I just received it and listed to parts of the CD. The book really holds your hand, so to speak, and builds on some excercises to get you up to speed in no time at all. You learn some fingerpicking arpeggios in the blues style, and in 10 pages they have you fingerpicking some cool blues rhythm.I have not gone too far with this book, but if you KNOW the BASICS (E chord, A chord, D chord, yada yada) you can really learn the basics. Just follow the well defined instructions. You can't go wrong with this book.I would definetly suggest listening to some CD's from some other Blues artists like Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder. Get the feel for the music and you can get in the groove."
5,Not just for beginners,"I really like this book. It is laid out in a logical progression that takes you from the beginning to more advanced techniques. It's suitable for beginners, but I would rate myself as a solid intermediate player, with some classical background, and I've enjoyed it too. It's fun to learn new techniques and a new style. The author covers alot, and even the exercises are interesting.This style of playing really makes the guitar a great solo instrument, and opens the door for playing a lot more music. If you are a beginner, and you take the time to learn this ""fingerstyle"", you will be able to play much more interesting pieces that just ""strumming"". I bought the book based on the reviews I read, and was not dissapointed. The CD really makes this a nice, easy to follow package. I'll be looking for book II? from the same authors."
5,A superlative step-by-step guide,"I probably own 10-20 instructional guitar books, but this one is the best. It is sequential and the steps are neither too large nor too small. The CD tells you exactly how each example should sound, which was especially helpful to me in dealing with syncopated rhythms. The most useful thing about the book was its program to make my thumb move more independently from the fingers - an essential aspect of fingerstyle guitar. This has carried over in every style of my playing. In fact, although the examples in this book are taken from the blues, I would recommend it for any type of fingerstyle guitarist."
5,Best introductory blues book,"I can't speak for how everyone learns. Some do better learning pure theory first (not me), while others learn better from listening and playing (or speaking, when I try to learn a foreign language). Beginning Fingerstyle Blues starts with a light enough history and definition of blues to whet your appetite, and then proceeds to give you a bite-sized bit of theory and background on some technique or style and then a short melody to play. I honestly haven't even completed it yet, but can say I had a modest background in music theory and technique (let's call me a novice guitar player) and I had no trouble working my way through the first half of the book. I'll update my review if my opinion changes as I progress further. Cheers."
5,Storage Box,Easy to put together . Placed on front porch for small package delivery when we are not at home . Keeps everything dry and out of sight .
2,"Nice Product, BUT...","Product arrived on schedule and assembly was not difficult. After assembled, I could see that the right side panel had a defect in it in that the fit was incorrect. I called customer service and the girl that answered seemed to understand the problem in that she asked me if it appeared ""warped"". She described it correctly but after returning from putting me on hold first asked if I could send pictures and then informed me that once put together it could not be unassembled and that there was nothing that could be done. So, here I am with an item that is defective with no recourse. I could send the assembled product back to Amazon, but the time and cost would not be worth it. I love Amazon, but just not the response from ""Suncast""."
3,Measurements warning if using for cushions,"The interior measurements of this box are 15x19. Since it is the inside of the box that counts, my 20x20 inch cushions will not fit. However since it is in fact a nice box and easy to assemble I will keep it for a toy box for the grandkids. The ad should really include the interior measurements, the actual usable space."
3,Great assembly but misleading description,"I bought for my cushions for the deck. Measured and found would fit based on the description, but to my surprise would not fit. Also, on the box it specifically stated could be used for extra seating. Inside the deck box cover it is imprinted onto the plastic that it cannot be used for seating. I would ship back to Amazon but first off, I can't get apart and second it would cost me about a third of the price of the item to ship back to exchange for a larger size. The deck box itself is extremely easy to assemble and looks great. I plan on using for gardening items since I can't return. Bottom line, good product but very misleading/contradictory info."
5,just right storage box,"Although this is a compact size storage box, it is surprisingly roomy. It is easy to assemble - parts snap into place - and because it is lightweight, it is easy to move around. I use it outside to store various sports' balls. I will likely purchase another in the near future."
5,Excellent storage for balcony,"I wanted a small storage box to store random things on my apartment balcony, and this box is perfect! It is sturdy and quite spacious, I was able to fit grill accessories, small gardening tools and even fit my large plant pots into it for the winter. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
3,"Protects well, lid sucks, QC focus","The good: Suncast makes a nice, thick quality weatherproof plastic group of products that are heavy and are built for heavy use. This is true of this product. The Bad: The ""hinge"" area that the lid attaches with is a molded peg that goes into the fitting on the back of the box, which would be good if it weren't warped. This is a problem since the plastic is so thick, you can't bend into the correct shape to get it in, so you are left with a lid that you have to secure every time you open and close it. Once closed, it does stay on and does its job by keeping things protected and dry outdoors. The warped section isn't discoverable until you have assembled the darned thing, so you are less likely to take it apart (maybe impossible) and return it. This is the main area that should be focused on while in the quality control phase, since it is a lidded box intended for cover. The rest matters less. Suncast should know this."
5,"Ya gotta get one, two, three","These Sunset Storage boxes are great - not only great looking but very strong and hold lots more than I expected. My 250 lb husband also sits on them to rest and they have handled him without any problems. They have stayed dry through the rain and winds we have had this summer including two tornados in the area. I have a small patio in my condo and two of them fit great - one on each side. I cant say enough about these except ""Ya gotta them."""
4,Niceley designed add-on without a doubt,"I am going to make this review short. Tribunal is an excellent addition to morrowind. And better yet, even like Unreal Gold, it's built into morrowind. Which is just plain awesome. New locations, items, allies, enemies, and just plain ordinary characters interestingly and beatifully designed and fun to interact with have been deisgned in tribunal. Although the expansion pack is a bit small, (which why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars), it is a great addition to morrowind, and I cannot wait till the bloodmoon expansion pack comes out.(I also got decent frame rates in areas of tribunal), I reocmmend it!"
4,it's great,"if you like morrowind, then there's no reason not to get this.it appears small at first, but when you get into it, it really lets loose. i don't want to spoil anything, but when you get into exploring the sewers, you'll REALLY know what your character is made of.however, i finished the main quest in like 3 days.. so it is kind of short, but i'm still not finished with Morrowind proper, and i now have some pretty sweet toys to help me along thanks to Tribunal. and i do keep going back to Mournhold just because there's so much to do."
4,great sata raid controller,easy to setup and configure. great performance in W2K3 Server. i wish i knew it would only support a (max) 2TB partition before i purchased it though.
3,Almost too much to do!,"Even though my mac is slightly below systems requirements I got Sims Unleashed loaded and running. I upped my virtual memory, but I am not sure how much good that did. ... There are added features including stores, pets and some new items. The problem is as most Syms players, with more than one family are aware, that it is difficult to keep all their needs met. With the chance to add a pet, who must me trained and feed and cleaned up after, skunks roaming around the yard that must have animal control capture them, racoons dupping the trash, not to mention going to the stores you can easily get over whelmed. The biggest problem I found was that all household members had to be at home before the ""cab"" would pick them up to go. The good new is if you want to cheat the word is still ROSEBUD."
4,s-----l-----o-----w,"I love the sims. I think it's a fantastic game, highly entertaining. I have greatly enjoyed the first few expansion packs, but with Hot Date and Vacation, my computer began to slow. (I have a second generation iMac with a GB of RAM) With Unleashed, it became oppressive, skipping and missing huge chunks of action.Hopefully with my new dual processor G5, this problem will resolve, but you shouldnt have to buy a $5000 computer to run a computer game. (yes, I'm buying the G5 for other reasons.....)The idea of the game is great, and the pets are fun. This is the largest expansion pack so far, with tons of new characters and items. Just make sure you have the computer power to handle the program."
3,aaaaaah!!!,"I have the Sims and the Sims Vacation and I was sooooo excited to get the Sims Unleashed!!! I installed it, played it, and quit. The next day I tried to play it, but it wouldn't work. I had to install everything 5 times!!! I think it put a bug into my computer or something because every time I quit a Sims game, I have to reinstall it to play it. AAAAAAAAH!!!!"
2,Unleashing the fury on my iBook!,"The game itself seems great. The pets are adorable, and I love the idea of an expanded neighborhood. My problem? Every time I attempt to go Downtown or to Old Town, the damn game crashes. Reinstalls and removal of all downloaded files does nothing. This is a bit frustrating for one who has played these games on PC without a hitch.You'd think a G3 700 MHz iBook with 640 MB of ram would be more than enough power for this game, but even when I boot up and don't do anything else, the game crashes. Is it too much to ask that they provide a product we can use?"
2,Tai Chi for Osteroporosis DVD,It's much to slow and hard to follow for me. Someone more familiar with tai chi might like it though.
5,Its like mt life is meant to be,"If any of you have played Megaman BattleNetwork 1 (If you haven't slap yourself) you know that the second is going to be something big. It has a ton of new features also including some bad ones now that your health doesn't replenish after every battle. But hey its cool it has a ton of new chips and graphics witch are through the roof. At the start of the game your Lan like always but you live in a much more technological city with tons of shops including chip shops,health shops,and a battle stadium.This is one of the best games I've played in my entire life."
2,uh hard,ok 1st of all i got this game thinkin it was a old style blast through everything that gets in your path megaman.2. some of the misions can take hours to do the net in the game is so big that you need to find 1 person to delete or 1 program that it gets boring. when doing some missions its always do one thing for one person so that you cando another thing 4 another and so on and so forth. the plot is kind of cool but the game doesn't stick with it. Meaning one day i'm taking a z license exam(i'll explain later) the next you'll be battling a net navi that works for a top secret org. Now on to the exams theres allways a bigger one is whatcame to my mind when playing the game. every time one of your friends in your city has an idea you have to taake an exam. and lastly your friends hate you in the bginning just because your mom makes you do in the game and i am not joking. other than that buy it.
3,Hmmmmm.,"...I is too castlevania feeling thing (castlevania is a good game) and had a too much of a Spyro the Dragon felling for GBA. I miss the side platform view of the old SNES versions! I want the side views like mega man X1 X2 X3 X4 and X5!!!!! This game is too diagonal for a mega man game which it not meant to be and it gets too annoying taking on enemies a little to your left while your killing one on the right because of its 3d like feeling. HEY CAPCOM, PLEASE MAKE MEGA MAN X5 FOR THE GBA!!!!! I WILL LOVE IT IF YOU DO!!!!!"
5,I play it a lot,this game is very fun and as for the durablity of this toy i hade it geting wet and it still worked great game good going toys r us! :)
1,"Bored, Bored and Bored in Wintry Instanbul",No hope. Life means nothing. Idling loser relative shows up and is a pain in the ass.Old mother get sick. Dreary exwife departs for Canada.You watch people think for endless minutes. This director must be an ARTISTE. Funny that the cover of the DVD matches a scene in the movie except that minarets are added to the background. Now that is high art.
5,"fine tip, short working distance, and high power","This iron is great. With the NT1 tip it can easily solder 0402 components or other equally small things. The distance from the end of the handle to the end of the tip is very short - another plus. The 65W power is also great - many irons of this size are only 25W, and sometimes you really need the extra power."
1,"first hydrofoil ive seen, would try a different maker..","Flimsy, three things wrong with it that I can tell so far, first i bought the steering stabilizers to go with the xp junior hrdofoil but this things screw holes are tapered and too small for the screws..Second about the hydrofoil itself, ithas two screws which hold it together but they spin in their holes if unscrewed more than once, another crap design feature;and the third thing that pissed me off with this device is it gave me two longer screws to attatch the device to the cavitation plate, and 2 short screws, when the short screws will not go through the plate and the device. SO i need to go to the hardware store and get some screws that should have been thought through enough by this designers.."
3,Good for some engine applications,"I had a 20' deeper v hull boat with a 125hp 2-stroke engine on it. By itself, it seemed to take forever to plane. I installed this hydrofoil on it, and it really cut plane time significantly, probably 30-50% although I did not time it. Huge difference in this application. It did not seem to affect top end either way, or make any noticeable change in fuel consumption.Then, I had a used 20' shallow water boat with a 150hp 4 stroke on it. This came already installed, and it takes a lot longer to plane than the previous boat, even with the reduced weight of the boat and the increased horsepower. It doesn't seem to do anything on this boat, and I'm going to try the SE Sport 300 instead."
2,An uneven release,"This album from Autumn's Grey Solace continues to fishing for influences from all over the dreampop/shoegaze/goth spectrum from MBV, Cocteaus, Lycia, the Cure and Curve. A nice mixture of styles and musically it feels solid however vocally the singing style seems uneven especially during the latter have of the CD. It feels like Erin Welton is having trouble singing or just simply out of breath on some songs. I'm not sure if this intentional or not but in other songs she flawlessly executes the track without erring. I also have issues with some of the more poppy accessible tracks tracks that sound like retreaded 90's alternative/electro-pop of Curve. They seem to use this as a jumping point for their fourth album Ablaze which seems to forge ahead into full on traditional pop/rock style and less synthesized dreampop or shoegazer songs. Their second album, Over the Ocean, seem to be their peak."
3,"Well, it's not that bad!","Robert seems to miss the point. Die Dissidenten play around with received music - they do that quite well, especially on Jungle Book, and were in the forefront of mixing Western dance/jazz and African/Asian musics together. This album is remixes of their work.....not likely to be too original - but, as always with remix albums, to give new aspects to the work. I think it does that adequately, but for originality you ought to listen to the Jungle Book (where the Karnataka College of Percussion display both originality and real skill)."
5,Greatest Game Ever,"I was pretty mad after finding out that nintendo had boughten out Resident Evil. But after awhile I finally came around, bought the gamecube, the memory card, and RE. It was totally worth it. There are plenty of things you'll remember from the old psx version, but so much more new, or changed things that the game is almost new. Overall, it has surpassed what I thought it'd be. It's so much fun. If you were a slight fan in any of the past RE games, I definetly recommend getting this one.On top of just being great, and fun, the graphics are near perfect. There isn't a real ""movie mode"", there is movies, but the graphics are about equal in both so the movies JUST what you'll play for. With great graphics, and a great gameplay, you'll also find a lot of replayability in it. There's lots of codes to strive for, another diffuculty setting, and a new mode called ""Real Survivor"" that is really hard, and challenging, but lots of fun to play."
3,"decent, but not a perfect game","This game may look realistic, but it has several flaws. The out and out difficulty of the play control annoyed the heck outta me. The story isnt that great either, and youll pretty much be spending your entire playing time looking at a red screen that says ""you are dead"".it all comes down to this: if youre all about graphics, you'll love this game. but if you like smooth play control and good storys, pass on this one and get the greates gamecube game yet, eternal darkness."
3,Scary stuff,This game isvery scary. If you like to be scared to the bone you should by the game. i think it is too scary.
5,Great!,"This game has the best graphics.A must have. It will be even more fun if you use the Action replay.Also, some people said they liked jill.*holds back laugh*LOL HORNY GAMERS!You don't play this game for eye candy, you play it for the scare and thrill of your life.I have never played the original, and the first time I played the REmake, I was in 4th grade. Now, a few months ago I REnted this game, and I still love it.a REviewer: ""Jill Valentine + Good graphics = sweet sweetness/best eye candy ever"".That person made me wanna laugh, If you want Eye candy, then turn the google image filter off! I REally REcommend this game, It has some REplay value and is REally great."
2,way overated,"sure, the graphics are good, but the games difficulty is so high it's just not fun, even with a guide. trust me, rent it before you buy it."
5,Resident Evil is 5 Stars!!!!!,"This game is packed new surprises such as guns, items, new monsters, and much more. Incredible graphics highly detailed backgrounds. Resident Evil will scare you and your Game Cube. Resident Evil is a complete remake of the first Resident Evil in 1996 for the PS (Playstation). This remake is not like Resident Evil Code Veronica to Resident Evil Code Veronica X, where some rooms are added and nothing else. Every little thing has different sounds. Excellent movie videos better understanding story."
5,This is a good one,"Resident Evil Remake it beats the original by far they add some things to make it more fun they put Lisa Trevor, The graphics are way better if you are a Resident Evil fan this is a must have because there lots of encounter's in this game and lots of killing action"
5,if you like resident evil you'll love it,"If you haven't tried one of the games in the resident evil series I recoment that you rent first, these are a adventure horror game and not for everyone. That aside if you want a resident evil game and this is a first this is where to start. If you have played every game in the series this is a great one for the collection. I owned the original on playstation and this is an amazing remake. The only downside is they have kept some of the old things such as not being able to drop an idem and needing to use the box system. These are minor annoyances and don't seem so bothersom unless you've played some of the later games. In any case I received this game two days ago and I love it, the game is fun and the graphics are amazing. Give it a go"
5,nintendo does it again,"Wow! That's about all I can say about this game. I have never played a RE game because it has never been offered on a nintendo system. If you have not guessed, I favor nintendo as my primary means of gameing. I have only owned this game for about a day and I am convinced that the impression that this game will leave will be one that other game systems will be desperately trying to catch up to. The opening sequence is clean and very smoothe, and even afer the opening sequence is finised, the graphic quality remains virtaully the same. Controlling the character is a little strange at first, but any die hard gamer will pick it up in no time at all. If the control seems a bit strange, it is only because change is inevitable, and the standard is being set once again by none other than nintendo."
5,Best Resident Evil so FAR!!!,"I have played every resident evil game to date. I played them on the playstation,dreamcast and the PS2. But they have nothing compared to the one on the game cube!!! The Graphics are Awsome, and the game has been totally revamped. This is a must HAVE!!! Cant wait till they release resident evil 0 and 4! If you love this game give Eternal Darkness a Try! Also a very awsome game!"
4,The Return of Resi,"Resident evil is a 'remake' of the playstation orignal,and what an remake it is!Admitidly the game plays the same as the first but with new extras such as an extra playable character and mini sub missions to indulge in.The gameplay has you hooked and the story line is engrossing ,but once finished it has the least of replay value.Then again think of the fun you have getting there.The eerie music and sublime lighting effects give you a real sense of anxiety whilst showing off the gamecubes sheer power.Overall Resident evil is a tremendous game and you can tell real effort has been put in to making such a Masterpiece.If you own a Gamecube,this is a a must to your collection!"
4,"Great SURVIVAL game, not action game","As someone who has fond memories of the original, I loved this game. It's a great remake of a classic.Some people have complained about the lack of ammo and so forth - that's the point! How can it be a shock to any gamer that the old RE games require ammo conservation? That's like knowing Sonic is a Hedgehog, everybody does. I wonder if they even realize this is a remake of an old game.I suppose Capcom could've increased the ammo in the remake to make the game more like RE4, but that would've made the game boring and easy (not that RE4 is either of those things, but it's a completely different kind of game), and it would've killed the suspense.This is not a run-and-gun action game, this is a survival game. If you think that's going to frustrate you, don't buy it. If, on the other hand, you have good taste, buy it."
3,"Great Game, Horrible Sellers.","Better graphics, but it still handles like a truck. But it's still as fun to play as ever!I was sort of upset, because I bought this game expecting it to be (unused), and brand new. Well, the game had been opened prior, and there were finger prints all over the back of the disks. Not only that, if I was going to get a used copy? I wouldn't have paid full price for it.So, in the future, (even though the game works) lesson learned. I refuse to buy video games on Amazon any longer. So be weary of who you are buying the RE (Remake) from, and if you can help it, buy it from an actual game store, so you can inspect your copy. I actually get my games now from a company in NY, who sells overly rare, and hard to find games. So GOODBYE to the crooks!"
4,Cinematic Marvel (but a control nightmare),"Resident Evil has taken graphics and cinematic artwork to a whole new level. This game is visually stunning, and not only has great game play, but is intellectually challenging as well. Puzzles, traps, zombies, guns, knives... what more could you ask for? How about new controls.Everything about this game is outstanding, with the exception of the complicated control set up, and often annoying fact that the point-of-view/camera angle cannot be adjusted.Overall this game is well worth buying as long as you have the patience to get past the complicated and annoying movement controls."
5,Great Game for all gamers.,"Over the last few years, I have played many games, but none more fun or challenging than this. It was great to finally play a challenging game with awesome graphics, great sounds, and an amazing storyline.This game is not just a remake of the original ""Resident Evil"", but it was totally redone. It has amazing graphics, unlike any other game that I have ever seen. This has more to it, and much better sounds. The voices were also redone. It has so much more, and is so much better than the original. It is fun, exciting, and scary. This is a ""Must Buy"" for anyone who owns a GameCube."
4,Resident Evil Gold,All I have to say about the game is if you are a resident evil fan like myself then you will no doubt love this game. The game is a great remake of the original but its more than a remake it builds on to the original game greatly. The visuals in this game are the greatest graphics that I have ever secne. This game proves that the Gamecubes graphics can go up against any gaming console out there. This game gets 5 stars because it is a brillant game. I recommend this game to any resident evil fan and or Gamecube owner.
4,A good remake for the best horror game-period.,"This game is- in a word- awesome. The graphics have to be the best that has ever been(with the exception of RE 0). The graphic changes from the original to the remake are simply breathtaking. While zombies look like colored-in walking blocks of annoying sound, the new zombies perform a too-smart-it's-almost-scary movement. The enviroments I could just stare in awe at for hours. This is a very challenging game with high replay value. There will be moments where you will piss your pants and go ""Holy sh**! What the hell was that?"" and sounds that will make you pause the game and go ""Holy sh**! What the hell was that?"" Never have I played a game with so much graphic detail and great gameplay at the sametime. One of the many Capcom's masterpiece's, this is a must-have."
5,Love the game but hate that I had to buy a new system,"Let's just say AWESOME! The look of the Gamecube version of this game is spectacular. There is no way to describe the difference in this version and the original this one is so far beyond anything I had imagined for this game.For me personally I wish they had a way to dumb down the game for someone like me who loves the game but isn't too good at playing it:) But that's my problem.My complaint is that I had to buy a new system in order to get this game. I mean I could make the choice not to buy, but then again I couldn't could I because I love Resident Evil.The game is a little hard for someone with my skill level, but for others who are highly skilled it probably won't be.This game shines above it's previous installments and makes you wonder if you actually ever played Resident Evil at all once you play this one."
5,SCARY AS [...]!!!,"The first thing i thouht when i picked up RE for CGN was, ""Kool a scary horror shoot em up, where u have an infinate amount of ammo."" Ha Ha Ha i think now. This game has more twists and turns than a bag of pretzels! U don't have infinite ammo, which actually adds to the fun!Some people say the camera angles [...], well that just mean it scaired the [...] out of them. The camera adds to the spookiness. When a zombie is lurking downs the halls, you look at the ground and u see the shadow before it. You really need your eyes and ears for this game. Buy it. It isn't the most scary thing on earth as advertised unless u let it scare u!!!"
5,Zombie love.,"I never played the original Playstation version but I did end up buying a PS2 and played the ""you know what"" out of RE2.When I heard that RE1 was coming to the Cube with better graphics and other changes I was thrilled.Without being able to compare it to the Playstation original I will say this about the first RE for the Cube.Incredible graphics.Music that gave me nightmares.Atmosphere, atmosphere and more atmosphere.Tough enemies especially the respawning ones scared the heck out of me.A great story line, excellent final boss, intriguing puzzles.All in all I can see why people fell in love with this series to begin with.A grade ""A"" title from start to finish.Any complaints?Nope.Highly recommended."
5,A must have (My review is of the Gamecube-remake),"To me this is one of the greatest games of all time. So many times while playing the original on PS1 (a classic) i have kept thinking how awesome it would be to play the same game with the same story, but with up-to-date graphics, sound and gameplay. Here you have it. The best of two worlds if you like. Even the remake is getting old nowadays, but the difference in games(graphics, gameplay etc.) between 1996 and 2002 is much, much bigger than the difference between 2002 and 2009. Worth every dime (even today). Highly recommended.PS: Things like this should be done much more often. Upgraded versions of your favorite games from the past. That would please millions of gaming-nostalgics around the world. Imagine a game like ""Moonstone: A Hard Days Knight"" for Amiga with todays graphics/gameplay etc., or any other for that matter. I wish:-)"
5,Love this game!,"Always loved this game since it was on PS1. It's even better on Gamecube. Still the best survival horror game to date, in my opinion. They added some stuff to this one that makes it even creepier and more suspenseful than the original! I was surprised that I could relive the experience of playing this for the first time."
5,Its so Scary its Scary,Best Game I have ever played in my life heres my review-Graphics-39 out of 10Control-9 out of 10Sound-10 out of 10Story line-10 out of 10Scariness-100 out of 10
5,This rules,"I am not a big game freak but my when my friend turned me on to this one, I could'nt stop playing it. If you like to be scared and love a good rpg then I highly recommend this game. The graphics alone are just so awesome. But when I finally beat this game I thought ""oh god, now what am I gonna do with my spare time? Get a job?!?"" There were many a night after playing it that I would not be able to sleep at night, it scared me that much."
2,???? i dont think so,the games controls are the worst and this game is really hard!! yes the graphics are some of the best thats not y u should buy this game its not worth is buy eternal darkness
4,Slow and tedious,"I can't believe how enthusiastic people are about this game. Yes, it looks great. The interiors and the sound effects are awesome. But the game-play is slow and tedious. The basic goal is to find little trinkets hidden in the house, unlock stuff and solve puzzles, all the while avoiding death-by-zombie. The zombies are cool and the gore is nice and bloody, but they're almost beside the point. Your character plods slowly around the house, looking for who knows what. I guess we're supposed to be thrilled by the challenge of pushing a piece of furniture across the floor, so we can reach up and grab some shiny coin that's sitting in a light fixture. Wow. Talk about terror. And the 3rd-person camera angles are awkward and far away from your character, so you feel like you're watching the game, rather than playing it, which diminishes the potential ""horror."" Save your money."
2,"Looks good, but...","I hated this game, pure and simple. Once again, Gamecube comes up with another lemon. Why is it that X-Box can produce GREAT games like Halo or Max Payne, and Gamecube still has nothing? Looking forward to Turok and Mace Griffen, but guess what? Those also come out on X-Box. What's the point of owning the Gamecube again?"
1,"Fun, But not for me.",I see why other people like this game but it's not the type of game for me. I think I decided to buy it because I was so amazed that they made a remake of 3D game. When i was 7 or 8 i bought the first resident evil used at a rental store. I thought you would battle zombies in a enclosed area. I was terrified the first time i played. I remember when jill's freind shoots off the zombie's head. Maby the zombies should die this way. This is one of the parts where the game is stupid. In the new game a zombie backs you into a corner. So what does you charachter deside to do? Fall down and trip. That was a great idea!! Lets do it again and again and again. Maybe house of the dead is more my type. In RE is you try to turn around and run away and when the zombie finally gets near you you have to turn around as slow as a blind cow with a broken leg on sleeping pills whose drunk.
3,Inconsistant,"The added features of this game just don't seem to fit next to the original material. You go from zero texture, to amazing in a single scene.Other than the fact that I think the graphics should have had a bit more of a rehaul, the game is pretty darn good. The new graphics are amazing, and the attention to detail in some of the areas of the mansion are astounding."
2,Good graphics and sound.....,"Shame about the rest. I picked this game up eagerly expecting something to blow me away. What I got was a slow moving, badly controlled character who cannot move and shoot (thus leaving her open to easy attack). This game is based purely on hype. People, get over it. Unless you are shallow enough to be swallowed in by the reviewers bought opinions (how could anyone find this scary? Tedious, yes, scary - hell no) there is absolutely nothing to offer in gameplay terms. Save your money."
4,Good......could have been better,"I have always loved the resident evil series since I was a kid. But this one just doesnt seem to be that fun. Sure, the grapics are excellent and the monsters look great but other than that it isn't too fun. Most of the time you are going back and forth threw doors looking for keys or other items. The only reason you wanna keep playing is to see a cutscene and that usually isnt gonna keep you hooked too long. Its a great night rental but not the best buy."
2,AWSOME GRAPHICS!!! but thats about it,"its a shame that a game with that much graphics is sooo bad. It is almost impossible to kill the zombies, the control style is the worste it could be, you can barely see the game unless you mess up your TV's brightness. In a nutshell the game has awsome graphics and cinimatics but everything else about the game is horrible."
5,Game worked great. Very fun,"The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The discs had minor scratches on them. The case had some minor wear as well but nothing major. The game played without any problems. This was one of my favorite games and i was very happy with the product. If you are a fan of resident evil and have a gamecube i recommend giving this game a try, you will like it."
4,Resident EPIC,"I found this game in a bargain bin at a Used video game store for $9.99! I am a fan of horror games and I had never played the original RE. My copy only came with the case and discs, no manual. I'm unsure if this affected gameplay. I had to consult walkthrough's, but I often do with RE games because they are hard, but back to this game. The graphics are stunning, the story is creepy. The outdoor areas are messed up. A Hunter or 2 jumping out of a door in my path made me jump a few times. Although this game is epic, it can get boring, because the mansion is just so quiet and once you kill all the monsters, you'll just be doing mindless chores, running all over the place. There are a ton of puzzles to figure out. I'm a grown up and this game was challenging. Don't let kids play or see this! Replayability is a low, but for any survival horror fan this is a must to play through at least once, and have in your collection."
5,Resident Evil more than a game,"I'll take personal offense if anyone says Resident Evil is no good. Most people have never played the PS1 original, even if they did there are 10 endings now. A great set off weapons, defense weapons, graphics etc. The best game ever."
3,OMG The greatest game ever....well.,"First of all the graphics are as hyped. they are beyond great. I recently bought a gamecube and this is one of the first games i bought. The graphics are jaw dropping. I also own a Xbox and this puts the Xbox to shame. Maybe the best looking game i have ever seen! The graphics are....No words can describe. AMAZING, SPECTACULAR! etc... etc.. So what's wrong with this game? The player controls are beyond bad. They are..Umm HORRIBLE! I haven't played the other RE games so i don't know if this is normal. But the player controls make the game harder then it should be. Push up you go down. Push down you go left..Blah Blah Blah, You really have to play the game to know what i'm talking about. Why a game developer would make a game with such Beautiful graphics and such Horrible gameplay is ....Well i have No idea, Bottom line Graphics beyond great(Xbox Eat your heart out) Gameplay Very..Very... Very BAD!."
3,This is no fun!,"This game makes me mad, i have played Resident evil 0,2,4 and code Veronica so i had different expectations from this game, the graphics are great and the puzzles keeps within the Resident evil tradition. What gets me the most is there seem to be no true direction in this version it's almost like being completely clueless, unless you cheat and use a game faqs guide you will have to start over a couple of times to get the flow of this game. Believe me you are always running! Your handgun with 15 shots can't take out a regular zombie dam! everything is scarce this is no fun, it will stay in my collection but! note this has no replay value and definitely not as a favorite of mine. I find the weapons to be pathetic, maybe because i have played Resident evil 4 before this version anyhow am not impressed by the game play laterz folks."
3,As far as I know completely AWESOME!,"I just pre-ordered this game and I am very anxious to get it. If everything I've heard is true then this game will be the best GC title for a while. THe zombies no longer shuffle towards you. They stampede! They don't even stop at stairs and doors anymore. Now they won't stop no matter what. More than half of the game is re-done. Every Item is placed in a different location and there are now two difficulty levels. Now with new weapons, very realistic 3D graphics, and a bunch of great fun this game is going to be great! I just cannot wait for this game to come out. As far as I know this is destined to be a system-seller. I would definately recommend getting this game...today!"
2,boring game and horrible controlls,"this game is horribleprosthe zombies were cool and there were good graphics.the first level (never got past it) was interesting.it was not to hard to save your game.consthere were the most horrible controls of all time you would turn out running into walls constantly.your character was so slow, you would be running into walls and since you have a slow character the zombies would grab you.your character was so weak the zombie would grab you about 2 or 4 times then the screen would say you are dead. Also you had the weakest gun it had like 10 bullets to shoot at the zombie then you would have no ammo, and it takes about 50 shots just to kill one.They also had the two characters if you pick the ladie she starts with a gun and the other guy starts with the sucky survival knife.All of the doors are locked over 75% of the time.[...] This is not a game you shoot zombies you just run away from them."
4,NICE!!,"The first RE game I ever bought was the Dual shock version of RE:2 for PSX back when I was about 9. I was scared shitless. But now (I'm 14 now) RE has become my favorite Horror(not the scariest,but most fun of horror genre) Video Game series. I've PLAYED the origional Resident Evil about a year ago, this is the Revised version of it. WAY better graphics, I THINK there's a new gun or two. This game makes you jump a few times, espically when your outside...at night...in the forest...BOO! I reccomend buying and beating Zero first, as they will interlock and you will understand the story. Also try RE:Really good graOutbreak for PS:2. phics and surviving with 3 other people makes it fun, but less scary. Anyway, RE:1 (revised) is a great thriller/shooter for the GameCube. 5/5 stars.P.S.-(...)"
1,Disappointing,"On a whole variety of levels, this game was very disappointing. The gameplay is repetitive and tired. The graphics, while good, just look too static. Not interactive, or organic. The sound was good, and made for some occasional creepy moments, but could have been improved further. Some of the sounds were downright annoying. The game felt rushed, and the gameplay old. I am sorry, this title was a major letdown. Sold on Ebay."
1,Camcom Fails to Deliver with This Horrific Game,"I would call myself an expert gamer. This game is terrible. Really, I've owned about 10 systems over the years and I can tell you, this game doesn't at all relate to some of Capcom's other triumphs, such as Devil May Cry or Onimusha Warlords for PS2. Terrible game...expecially the controlls. Capcom should have taken advantage of the feather-soft feel of the GCN controllers. Oops. Better luck next time guys.3 out of 10"
1,TOO SKARY!,This game was done horribly! The freakish zombies and crazy monstrosities were way too intricately designed. They looked so real! And the sound effects...believe me I was effected. Everytime I turned a corner they'd be there. Those nightmarish creatures that I always try to escape in bed. The game [is not good] It is way to creepy. Period.P.S. TOO SKARY for EVERYONE! I really don't understand who the creators think they're audience is.P.P.S I'm serious. I was really terrified. But I guess the game is alright.
1,A could have been Good game,"The camera angles in this game our awful it is so hard to move around. Also the game is very hard. I rented this game today. I'd never played resident evil. I hate this game. I have been wanting this game for a while, but it is bad. It isn't fun. Unless you like puzzle game with no ammo for shoting, pistols(you can't find any other guns) and no action, and bad camera angles.Don't get this game."
2,Not worth ure money go for Code veronica for PS2!!!!,Ok shure u think it would live up to the hype but NOOOOOO!!! ure wrong. great the graphics r good so wut it is even shorter then the first one the puzzles are lame and i beat it in like 3hours oh fun. it dosent even scare u nuttin jumps out and then theres sharks wut does sharks have to do about it wut the t-virus took over them to!!! geeze the gameplay u cant even move that is how bad it is its so dark u cant see were u are and u dont know wut is goin on...if u have a gamecube dont buy it BUT IF U HAVE A PS2 THEN GO BY RESIDENT EVIL...
1,a very diapointing game,"1. pre- renderd backgrounds aren't so great, its not using the game qube's hardware to generate the backgrounds just the software.2. Pre renderd back grounds can cuase clipping, a major programming problem.3. same crppy controls and camera angles.4.who cares if there's a new character the game going to end the same."
5,Same media as came with the tank,"Originally, they did not ship me the correct amount. However, when I called customer service, they immediately sent me the corrected amount of rocks."
3,Other comp cds may be better bargain,"Disc one really shows Devo at their peak while disc 2 shows why I stopped buying their albums from ""Shout"" on. I had hoped that there might be some hidden jems that I missed the first time around, but disc 2 is full of unimspired dance tunes and cover songs. I wonder what they were thinking when they re-made ""Bread and Butter""?New fans will appreciate some of the pre-label versions of their songs(Jocko Homo, Mongoloid) though hardcore fans have certainly heard these before on vinyl(or on the Hardcore cd). It's nice to have ""Worried Man"" on cd. Where's ""Pink Pussycat"", by the way.New spudboys might be better served by buying the first 3 albums and skipping the later stuff. I see Amazon has an import of ""Duty Now for the Future/New Traditionalists"". Not a bad dealNow, how about a DVD of all the Devo videos!"
4,"Excellent, but not as good as the ltd edition rhino CDs!","I love the first CD in this set, and there are maybe 5 songs on the second CD that are pretty good. The rest reminds me why I don't like the later albums.A few weeks after purchasing this, I got two CDs in the mail from Rhino Handmade - The reissue of ""Dev-O Live"", and ""Recombo DNA"". Recombo DNA is a 42 track double CD, but instead of lots of hits it is full of demo versions, obscure live songs and unreleased tracks. Some gems include an old live version of ""Words Get Stuck in my Throat"", which was re-recorded for the ""Pioneers"" anthology, and the studio version of ""Somewhere with Devo"", which showed up in live form on ""Now It Can Be Told"".They could have made an amazing 3 CD set by combining the first CD of Pioneers with Recombo DNA."
4,Pioneers Who Made the Music,"Starting as a cult favorite in the mid-70s, word of Devo's powerful live shows spread throughout rock music fandom. Never as enjoyable on studio recordings as they were live, this collection spanning their 25 plus year career nonetheless showcases the quirky inventiveness and originality they brought into play. Contained in the first 25 songs/narrative cuts are some (""Uncontrollable Urge"", ""Be Stiff"", ""Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA"") that can truly be considered gems reflecting a unique view of our world and the devolving ""spuds"" of the great unwashed. Their creativity as a unit gradually dimished as the mid-80s wore on, but one can still see their relatively lasting imprint on entertainment, advertising and, yes folks, even politics: witness Al Gore, the original role model for ""Mongoloid""."
5,"Cool cover is worth the fun, but....","Okay, maybe I lied, but still this is one GREAT set! It really brings back memories of the late '70s and early '80s.The first disc is definitely the better of the two, but that is not saying that the set is only worth one disc. After about two weeks of solid listening I have come to the conclusion that my money was well spent. I have discovered a side of Devo that I had hardly heard, and enjoyed the older songs.Worth ever penny, even with the COOL cover."
4,A career overview,"From the orginal indie lable singles to songs from various movie soundtracks, this is a two disc career spanning overview of Devo. It showcases their point of view very well. It includes a studio version of ""The Words Get Caught In My Throat"" a concert closer as sung by Booji Boy. Also included is ""It Takes A Worried Man"" their song from the movie Human Highway.The booklet is packed with everything you need to know about Devo's de-evolutionary philosophy. This is a quality release that serves Devo very well, but not perfectly. I'm left to ask, in the end does any career compilation serve any band as completely as it was conceived to?Together Pioneers Who Got Scalped: The Anthology and Recombo DNA serve as a quasi box set of Devo's carrer."
4,...well the first disk is excellent...,"The first disk is gloriously excellent, but like most anthologies these days, the second disk is a painful and cringeworthy reminder of what drew the great band to a close...Better off buying Devo's first 3 releases in their entirety would be my advice, as the first disk of the anthology left me wanting more of their early period."
3,Shallow coverage -- Good for introduction,"This book touches several aspects of Weblogic administration. But MOST of the topics are very shallow at best. There are hardly any practical insights, pitfalls, etc.This book is good for anyone who want to know WLS admin stuff over a weekend. For a real admins, it falls well below the mark. I was disppointed that Performance Tuning chapter was hardly anything useful.However, this is a good book for anyone preparing for interviews. It gives a quick guided tour."
2,very average,After reading the reviews of this book I expected good things. Basically it offers nothing new for an intermediate to advanced administrator. The examples are from bea and I regret buying it
2,Waste of money,It is one of the most frustrating books I ever read. This book does not cover the in-depth knowledge required to perform administrative tasks. It provides screen shots and lists (most of the time incomplete) steps to complete a task. As a Bea WebLogic Administrator it offered me minimal help.
2,Just Ok in my Opinion,"This book is ok but it can't compare with the BEA Weblogic Server Bible. The Bible only convers Weblogic Versions 6.0 and 6.1 but it has a lot more information on Server Adminstration from a Developers perspective then this book does.For example if I wanted to know how about Parameters or options for deploying JSP, this book will not get you there but the Bible will.Same thing with JMS in my opinion.The Bible has more information on both pure Administration and Administration from a Developers Perspective."
2,Nothing useful except for beginner level!!!,"A book on WebLogic 7 Server Admin should not be written like its for a complete novice. Instead of q book for real admins, the content is actually dumbed down from the BEA docs which are hardly useful in themselves. The style is do step 1, step 2, etc. It doesn't explain the technical issues involved in making various choices and how they affect the server and its applications. Explanations when they do appear are brief and pretty much the same dribble that's in the BEA docs. This is first and only book I ever returned to Amazon. I regret that some of those giving good reviews either don't know anything about server administration or have other motives."
4,"Not quite as good as the play, but likely about as good as a movie version can get","I recently saw the stage play in San Francisco in an intimate 50-seat theatre, the perfect venue for the powerful 3-actor play. The movie stays faithful to the play throughout, adding only some minimal scenes that fill in some of the back story contained in the play's dialogue. Filming it on location in Cape Town was therefore a good idea to lend an air of authenticity. The actors in this movie filling the play's roles of Hallie, Sam, and Willie are top-knotch, playing their roles with the required sensitivity. The movie lacks the power & punch of the stage play, which I think can only be properly conveyed from the stage, but it got as close as can be expected. If you can't see the play, this movie is a reasonably good alternative."
2,Could of written a better shooting script for the movie.,I was disappointed in the movie. The movie length was 83 minutes. The 1934 movie called No Greater Glory was only 73 minutes and was a little more complete than this one. I think that this movie should have been over 100 minutes in length just to tie up some loose ends. For instance I would of liked to have seen a little more of the father in this movie. There could of been a good prologue of the boys youth to introduce the rest of the movie. In all I think a fifty cent movie has been inflated to an amount of over Twenty dollars. Don't even buy this movie until you have at least rented this movie and judged for yourself whether it is worth the purchase. To sum up it would of been better had the script been expanded and altered for showing on a dvd or a movie screen.
1,The kindle version has no images.,"I was excited to find an eBook available for this important work and purchased immediately. I found out when reading that there are no images. When the text refers to a diagram, there is no diagram and the ebook tells you to refer to the printed version. That does not work for me since I do not have the printed version.The images and diagrams are a very important part of this book and the decision to leave them out seems to have been poorly considered. If I had the printed book at my disposal then I would not need or want the kindle version. It would surprise me a lot if anyone who owns this already pricey book would be interested would be in the almost equally expensive yet seriously flawed electronic version. I still want the book and will order the printed work eventually.Amazon gave me a full refund so there is no problem there."
1,No Cover for this special gift,Disappointed this book came with no cover! I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my mother. I don't quite understand why the picture shows the cover of the book but it arrived bare and plain.
2,false advertising,"although i am well aware of the fact that the contents of the book are what is important, i was a bit disappointed when my book arrived without the cover. again, over time, i'm sure that the cover would have somehow ripped or torn off given my rough handling of everything not living. however, i feel that amazon, or any internet retailer for that matter should send everything that is shown in the internet image. it is after all, the only thing we(internet shoppers) have to go by. i am quite pleased with the book, ecstatic really. which is why i would have loved it even more if it came just 'as shown'."
5,Packer Flag,"Very nice heavy material, two sided large 28 x 40 NFL Green Bay Packer banner flag looks great hanging in the front yard"
4,good bood,This is a good book by two well known experts in the field. I like the book but wish it was a little bit more 'how to' do the analysis. The book is short and spends a lot of time (to many pages) defining what the issues are with analysis of cluster data. I would not have bought the book if I needed those issues defined. I needed help with the statistical analysis and there is not quite enough information there. Would have liked to see some sample data and some SAS output. But still its a good book and I learned a great deal reading it.
2,Too Simple,"Maybe if you had a better foundation in Biochemistry, this would be great. However, it was just kinda...all over the place."
2,not ridiculously simple,"I didn't find this book helpful. The memorization tools were way too complex for someone who simply needed help understanding the material (there is a map of the biochemical carnival that is-no joke-4ft long). I suppose if you have tons of time to really study this on its own you could go in and nail biochemistry, but if you are trying to use it as a supplement... Just know it wasn't useful for me, and I regret spending my money on it."
1,this book is all nonsenses,"Do not buy this book, you are gonna waist your money and your time, i like the ridiculously simple series but this is such a bad book..."
2,Barely helpful !,"The author of this book failed to simplify clinical biochemistry and to make it ridiculously simple as the title claims. He used a children's approach for learning by utilizing cute names and funny drawings as a mnemonic tool. However, his apporach didn't succeed too well, and made the book ridiculous but not simple. I give this book poor ratings on clarity, style, and substance. It is also too expensive for what it offers. It is NOT worth every penny!!!"
2,Too simplified for those needing more background in biochem.,"I found it hard to make the jump in the author's simplified analogies. I needed more basic information about lipid land. I was looking for simplified description of biochemical processes not an overly simplified generalization. I had to refer to other biochemistry and nutritional text to understand what the author was refering to. I would not recommend this in place of a good biochemistry text. When complex processes are first introduced, detailed explantions of conversion processes are needed to get the depth of understanding. The map in the back was a strong plus. It took all the body processes and joined them together to show interactions among the chemical conversions. This was the strong point for the entire book and I might have purchased the book just for that. This was a recommended text for a nutrition class, but the instructor admitted she would not have recommended this had she looked through it first."
2,Review,"It contains a fairly decent chapter on metabolic diseases, related to biochemistry.Helpful as a possible review, not as a primary study source."
4,Good price!,I felt that this was a really good price for this product. I've seen it the stores for much more. My husband likes and uses this product so we stocked up.
3,HOW TO BE A GOOD SECRETERY 101,"This is a good introductory text on being a secretery or a receptionist. This would be most useful for people just starting out without any office experience who don't know what a spreadheet is. To anyone else the text is too basic, though it covers a wide range of office related matters and because of that this might be useful as how to reading for a newly appointed office manager with no prior experience. What this doesn't reveal are any tricks of the trade you would expect an old salt to have. Also disturbing is the casualness with which the author accepts the abuse she endured as secretery from the egotistical octopuses in the entertainment industry that she worked for."
1,Waste of Money,"I have 2 issues with this book:1. Why is this book listed at $27-31, when it is printed $12.00 on the back? I feel ripped off.2. This book is AMATEUR. I EXPECTED SOME GOOD INFORMATION, NOT ""don't do drugs on your lunchbreak, it will affect your work,"" or ""don't try to be cute, it is not professional."" Another good tip I learned, ""No screaming, swearing, or throwing things."" Who needs to be told to NOT do this? Please. Oh, something else I learned, ""Any hairstyle that requires a diffuser should be reconsidered."" OMG Please."
1,Very Elementary,"This book is for an entry level assistant. I have been working as an assistant in corporate America for 10 years and needed something to motivate and refresh me. This isn't it. This is an explanation on how to organize files, answer phones and basic business etiquette. Perfect for someone starting out."
2,Book is for yesterday not for today!,Book is outdated. Too expensive and not a great help for executive admins. Purchased book and decided it was not for us and contacted seller to see about a return. No response received from seller. Will not purchase from them again.
2,Doesn't seem to work,I tried this product in my yard and I still have cat problems. I used it as directed and utlimately sprinkled the whole 3lbs around the perimter and anywhere I had seen fesces left behind. But to no avail. I even saw two cats just hanging out in my yard pretty much within a week of putting the stuff down. I don't know if it is supposed to keep them away completely or just discourage them from using my yard as a litter box. But so far it hasn't worked on either count. Maybe I just need to get a Coyote and chain him up in the yard!!!!!...
1,Switching to an annual plant for benefits!,"I tried this product and it didn't work at all. I am switching to a plant called ""Coleus Canina"" also known as ""Scaredy Cat Coleus"". It is an annual plant with blue flowers on it that cats hate. I cannot guarantee that it will work but the reviews I have read are very positive. The down part is that it is an annual plant and you have to plant it every year. Hope this helps some of you out there.I will let you know how it goes!"
1,Shake Away does NOT keep the cats away,"I purchased the Shake Away Cat Repellent Granules because I have been having a major problem with stray cats urinating and defecating in my flower beds. Since I am pregnant, this meant that I was unable to weed or plant any new plants during the spring and summer. I had hoped that with the Shake Away that I would see some relief from the constant visits by the stray cats. However, this was not the case. The cats came right into the flower beds, sniffed the granules, and preceded to urinate anyway. I will be demanding a refund from the company. I would not recommend this product to anyone.Shake Away 3-Pound Cat Repellent Granules Fox & Coyote Urine 3002003"
1,This stuff doesn't work,Do not buy this product!! It is a complete waste of money. It did absolutely nothing to keep the cats away.
2,Not Effective,"This was a waste of money for me. As soon as it rained, the product washed away and the cat came right back to use my lawn as a bathroom. The only product that seems to work to keep the cats from ruining my lawn is ""Catstop"" (the high pitch cat chaser)."
1,Not Worth the Money,"This is an expensive product for the benefits. Outdoor cats have selected one area of my back yard to leave deposits. After spinkling most of the granules, I found that for a day or so they seemed to leave the area alone. Then the deposits started again. Also, once it rains, the product is washed away. For the price versus the short-term effect, I would not order or buy the product again. Also, and this was a big factor, the packaging from Amazon was terrible. The plastic jar was out of the plastic wrap, and the top had opened, spilling some of the granules into the cardboard shipping box. While the granules are not poisonous, I still had no intention of having my own indoor cats coming in contact with the product. I found one of my cats sniffing around the unopened box from which some of the granules were falling out. All in all, this product was not a good experience."
1,terrible,When I received this product the top was off and half of the product had fallen out of the container. The box that it was in could not hold the product. It was falling out of the box as the driver delivered. Very unhappy. Never order this product again. I had ordered it once before but that time they put tape on the top. That was much better.S.Elkins
1,Gueee,"You need to keep buying it and using it to keep cats away, not worth it.. Not good for other pets or your backyard."
1,"HA HA...okay, where is the REAL cat repellent??","BEWARE!!! THIS PRODUCT SAYS IT HAS A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE!!! IT IS ONLY FOR THE 20OZ SIZE AND PACKETS!!!!!!!!!!I highly suggest you purchase this from a place that you can return it to when it doesn't work. Their ""GUARANTEE"" is only for the packets and 20 oz size. Why not for the larger sizes? I asked. ""Oh, because we figured someone who wants to use the product would use the smaller size first to see if it would work. Gee, so someone with a large lot or acreage should buy a small bottle and try it? The cats would just use another part of the property....DUHHHHHHH!!!! I'm returning my 2nd bottle (I bought a 20oz specifically for that purpose) I'm out $30+shipping for the 3lb size because they don't ""Guarantee"" that size! Maybe because they know their product is CRAP!!!!Oh, and forget trying to mix it with water to spray it. It is just like putting sand in water...."
2,Cardinal hat,"Hat seemed very small, returned it for full refund. There was no way this LARGE hat would fit my adult son"
1,Distasteful,"I love Rebecca Winters...usually. This one though unlike the other two reviewers, I found distasteful. 13 years ago the hero, Alex had a night of wild sex with the heroine's sister, Melissa. She gives birth to his son and dies so Darrell raises the boy. Alex is about to get married and Darrell decides he needs to know about his son. Alex had given Melissa a ring he wore before he went back to his country which is how her sister Darrell was able to track him down. I've never liked books where the hero sleeps with two sisters and this is no exception. Just the thought of sleeping with any of my three brother-in-laws would make me want to puke and they are good-looking guys so looks is not the reason. I just think sleeping with someone who was already intimate with your own flesh and blood is creepy. Sorry, just my humble opinion!"
4,why??,i bought this product and never got the memory stick pouch or the full size tripod or the usb card reader i'm wondering why i haven't gotten it. if you could send it that would be great i got everything else just not those 3 items let me know the deal.Thanx
5,perhaps the best one,"Michael Hurley is charming, original, and truly inconsistent. I love him in principle but it's hard to find an album of his without serious clunkers, remakes, re-remakes, or even remakes of clunkers. Have Moicy exerted some discipline on him which was never to return.Watertower and Snockgrass contain the highest ratio of great material to OK material. I favor this one. Standouts for me are ""I Still Could Not Forget You Then,"" though maybe it's a little too cute. Even though there is nothing on here as deep as ""Open Up (Eternal Lips)"" or as sly as ""Biscuit Roller."" Thumbs up, anyway, Snocko."
3,Great Expectations,"I so wanted this to be a great album, especially after the disappointment of ""Rage"". There are some quite good tracks here and would disagree with the first reviewer that it has no merit at all. Phil Mays vocals are a bit patchy, somes tracks great but others are lacking.I quite like the version of ""Hollis Brown"", however I dragged out the original and realised it didn't have anywhere near the intensity of Dylans vocal delivery. I hope that with further listenings it will grow on me, however if this was a school report, I'd have to say ""could do better"""
5,My New Favorite Series!!,"Soul Eater is everything you look for in a great television series, action, romance, comedy, and a compelling story that will catch the attention of any anime fan. I've just started watching today, and i've only watched episodes 1-4, (seince thats all I can see for right now). Again, buy this DVD if your looking for a great series to watch, you won't be disappointed with Soul Eater."
3,Horrible ending for an awsome show,"I have seen the whole series online with subtitles it starts out as one of the coolest ones I have seen in a while. Lots of good episodes but towards the end especialy the last episode it losses something. The ending for this series sucks kind of like gurren lagen. It is always sad when a good series cant end deciently. For a really good series I recomend cowboy beebop, fooly cooly, macross plus or gunbuster."
4,Left by the Indians,It was a short easy story too read. Will help all to see how blessed we are and how many before us have suffered to bring us to where we are today.
3,Not quite what I was wanting to read.,"It was ""okay"" but just not my type of book, I guess. Might be interesting to someone else, however. I don't really know what else to say about it. The journey of across America was long & arduous and I suppose they were frightened with the Indians hanging around nearby but as she wrote, ""God protected them from harm."""
3,Brief,Too short would have liked more details but overall was very interesting. wonder if could be relatives _ last name of cousins and uncle Trimble.
1,Left by the Indians,"I was expecting a book and found a short story instead which was disappointing. It was an OK story but not much depth. kind of left you hanging, wondering, is that all?"
3,Interesting; not enough,"This booklet was interesting, but was lacking a lot of detail about who the person was and her experiences. Too Short"
2,Not compelling,"Having read some first hand accounts of pioneers who crossed the country on the Oregon Trail and aacounts of the Donner Party and other such histories, I had hopes this would be an interesting and detailed first hand account of an historic experience. I found it lacking."
1,Not worth it.,"Very poorly written. At times almost incomprehensible. Although , without a doubt, a terrifying and horrific ordeal, very few facts and details. There is nothing to be learned from reading this book."
5,excellent service,"I ordered this book from another supplier, it was never shipped! I ordered from this supplier and it was received in record time. For natural healing this is the book! Doctor visits are rare. I am a drug free and pain free senior citizen."
5,Hand Reflexology,The Hand Reflexology book I ordered is just what I wanted. The book came in excellent time and in good condition as offered.I would purchase again from this party.
1,Worse than the internet,I am cleaning my room just now and decided to throw away this book. Only about 10% of the book contains any information about the reflex points (basic how-to not included). Internet is a much much better resource for the topic.
3,It was okay,"Once again, I had to purchase this book for another course in my MPA program. My review is probably bias as I didn't like the course. If it wasn't required, this is something I would not have selected. Perhaps the course would have been a little better had the professor selected a different book."
3,9th edition coming out soon,"9th edition coming out soon (Jan 2013), 8th edition will likely be replaced as textbook. See link below for new edition.http://www.amazon.com/Administration-published-Wadsworth-Publishing-Hardcover/dp/B00A0725K6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1356412116&sr;=8-2&keywords;=9th+edition+fiscal+administration"
2,"Mikesell needs to write more succinctly... please see Lee, Joyce and Johnson.","Public Budgeting Systems by Robert D. Lee, Philip G. Joyce, and Ronald Wayne Johnson is written more clearly... if you have a choice, buy this book. The problem with Mikesell is that he has to write 200 pages (six chapters) to explain the concept of revenues in the budget process. Too many trees were wasted in the development of this book. Lee, Joyce, and Johnson can do this in 40 pages.The greater majority of my Public Budgeting Systems class at George Mason University feels that the Mikesell book is written in a manner to lull oneself to sleep... the benefit is that one could read the book rather than using drugs to induce sleep.However, if you are required to purchase the Mikesell book, you should go to the Amazon UK web site and complete your transaction there... you can save yourself about 70 to 80 dollars."
3,"Mikesell needs more money, reprints same book with new picture on the cover",Are you looking for this book for your MPA course? Save some money and buy an older edition. They're all the same!!!
2,Leaves something to be desired...,"I use this book in a public budgeting graduate class. For people with limited knowledge of public budgeting or fiscal administration in general, this book leaves much to be desired. A certain base knowledge is required and one must be able to decode the private language of budget scholars to understand the writings. Examples are frequently presented with no clear connection to the text. This book is regarded as one of the best, but I would not recommend it for anyone without prior knowledge of the subject or to someone looking for a quick and easy explanation of budgeting."
3,A little difficult to read,Book is somewhat difficult to read and understand. You need to do a lot of research in order to find related information in an easy and understandable way. Needed it for a class and so far I expend more time trying to understand the book and it's content than anything else.
1,Difficult to understand; Kindle version omits info,I purchased the Kindle version with the hopes of getting the same material without the lugging around a huge textbook. The book itself is hard to understand and the Kindle version omits certain parts of the textbook because it is unable to reproduce it due to copyright restrictions. Pretty useless when your professor refers to the chart/photo in the book that I don't have in the Kindle version.
3,Overly wordy,"This book is said to be one of the best books on the topic of budgeting, and that may well be so. My gripe with the book is that the author takes too many words to get to the point. The book makes one wish writers realized that people have other things to do than read their books, and that they would just get to the point in the fewest words necessary to do so."
2,Good reference,"It's a good book. Specially the later chapters on gears and engines. But by no means should it be used as the main text for the subject. All the drawings,diagrams, ""free body diagrams"", are black ink on brown paper, so it's hard to see what line is a vector and what line is part of the body of the component. Is this a line? Is that a line? Wait, is that the arrow of a vector or a splotch of ink? Maybe it's the bottom of the machine they are trying to depict? Who knows. The book is based on a text that was released sometime between 1965-1971?, It was on the front pages but I threw my copy in the fireplace because the professor I had used it as the main text and made me hate it. If you want a good book on these topics get Norton's Design of Machinery. Way better."
3,Kinematics and Dynamics of Machines,"The book has drawings and descriptions that can be confusing. It takes a lot of time reading to use this book. No answers in the back of the book which can be frustrating. This book is old, and you can probably find a cheap used version without much difficulty. No need to buy a new version."
4,Plastic For Paper!,"The Wrap N' Craft is an okay storage unit. Does what is says but it is hard to open the main storage. The small top opens easily, not so the bottom. We have just the opposite problem with our cover than the first reviewer. You have to literally shake the cover off. Maybe our covers were switched! The top storage opens okay but really doesn't hold more than scissors and tape. The main storage is adequate, although, it does not hold the extra long rolls of paper. For the price and for storing wrapping paper rolls it rates five stars but because of how hard it is to open I list is as a four star item. I have one of theRubbermaid Jumbo Wrap N'Craft Vertical Storageunits that I much prefer. It holds the extra long rolls of wrapping paper and is easy to open.~ Mrs. B."
5,great!,another awesome installment in the already well known and loved Gauntlet series.fun with a friend or alone.5 stars!
4,Good game,This is a good game for xbox and PS2. I don't have an xbox but PS2 i have great game buy it its worth all your cash.
2,Amusing but very simplistic and repetitive,It's an okay game but is very watered down and simplistic. It will quickly bore anyone with much intelligence or above the age of 13. It's a lot like D&D; heroes in that sense.Add to this that the people online are all price gouging right now when you can buy the same game used in real used game stores for $8.00 as of the end of January. I saw a store with 20 copies of them at the $8 price and they say they have just as many at their four other branches. I bought one for my nephew who is 4.
4,An awesome multiplayer game!,"I loved the original arcade version of Gauntlet as a kid. I spent so much money on it. I couldn't wait until Gauntlet: Dark Legacy was released for the XBox. Graphics are nice. The gameplay is good with nice changing camera angles dependent on where you are on the screen. I believe they even have the same guy doing the voice-over from the arcade version.What is really cool about this game is the multiplayer mode. Nothing like having a few friends over for some four-player Gauntlet fun. I just wish the game utilized the 5.1 Dolby Digital capability of the XBox but I understand that it is really not needed for this game.In addition, there are so many characters to choose from now, not just the Warrior, Wizard, Valkrie, and Archer from the original. I believe that there are 24 or so characters that can be unlocked for this game. Talk about replay value!"
3,"I love Gauntlet , but...","I love Gauntlet, but I have some minor gripes. First, the graphics aren't that much better than the N64 version. I expected alittle more from the powerful and mighty XBOX. Second, some of the levels are taken from the N64 game. Keys, barrels, and runestones are in the same spot!!! ( Note: Of course there are far more levels and characters than N64, but re-hashing old levels. Pleeessse. Bottom line: If you're new to gautlet, give it a try. It's simple, fun and a good multiplayer.If you're a Gauntlet veteran, enjoy the game- just don't expect to be blown away.Would I buy it again? Yes."
2,EXTREMELY BORING,Well this game was pretty basic... a bunch of freinds all get to gather to kick evils butt. sounds fun right...WRONG. in this game all you do is toss projectiles at what ever comes your way. the only thing i enjoyed was the boss battles. hahaha all four players would be slaughtered! any way i dont reccomend this game.
1,This time Midway went the [wrong] way,"I am a total hardcore action/adventure/RPG fan, and thats what this falls into. I'll play almost any game, and mostly like it, but this game disappoints]. The graphics are really nasty, seriously, they are really cartoony. The voice acting is soo bad, and there are plenty of glitches in what he says. The storyline is...what is the storyline? You're not an important character at all. The gameplay is the only somewhat good part. It's just really [bad] that you throw your weapon around. You can go into hand to hand too. If you dont have 4 controllers this game is even more stupid. If you are an RPG gamer, or like action/adventure, this game is NOT what you think. If you liked all the gauntlet games, this is for you. But I think this game [DISAPPOINTS]..."
2,This game blows,"I guess I'm just used to being able to look where I want to look, whether it's ahead of me, behind me, or to the side. None of that here, though. You'll look where they make you look and you'll like it, mister! After having played every other game that gives you pretty much complete control of your character, that part really annoyed me. While this is true of the original Gauntlet, I expected more from the Xbox because, well, because more can be done. Of course, I rented the game and there were no directions in it, but after playing it for a few hours and figuring out I'm sure almost all of it, I found it not worthy of purchase. It did have some cool parts, but I would heartily recommend renting this game first before buying it to make sure you like it. That's sound advice for any game, but especially this one."
2,All is good except weapon,"I would have added more stars if the game allowed you to buy weapons and actually be able to keep it and use it more than a 30 seconds. Weapons and magics disapears after a quick 30 - 60 seconds. You gain a new look after every 10 levels. All attacks are missile attacks, no matter if you are an archer or a knight. This game is sort of easy and not as challanging as it may look in the cover. All the more reason not to judge a game by its cover. Don't get this game unless you know what you are going to get."
5,best game ever,it is so fun me and my freinds call it blue sourcerace because we always axcedently pick blue sourcerace we get far and excited
5,Graveyard Soldjas Best Album By Far,"This is the only Graveyard Soldjas album i own, but that is for a good reason. After this album, they went completely downhill (based on what i have heard from the other albums-they bring a totally different and much worse style and sound than on this album). But ""Day of Execution"" is awesome. GYS nice, harmonious and yet eerie beats, mixed with smooth quick flows make for a great sound throughout the album. My favorite tracks are 3,4,7, and 9, but the whole album is solid-only drawback...its a lil short,but still worth it. If you can find this album, pick it up."
3,lawfords pretty good,"Not a bad sequal ,not bad at all, Sammy davis jr Peter lawford throw Jerry lewis into the mix, and you have....comdedy?? sort of, Sammy davis jr doe's his best Jerry lewis inpersination to date and peter lawford kills as 2 characters,thats 2!! its good clean well paced fun,sort of,"
3,"I want to completely black, but I do not see","I want to completely black, but I do not see.please...... publish it black"
3,OK but not for learners of Portuguese Foreign Lagnuage,"I like and admire this grammar but this is not a grammar for foreign learners of Portuguese. It goes into colloquialisms that are not standard language. I am bilingual and teach both English and Portuguese. Some English speakers say 'me bag' for 'my bag', but I teach my students the latter. The same way some of the colloquialisms in Perini's book are not appropriate, are not what a learner needs to know to speak the language in an acceptable manner."
3,Not the best reference grammar for learners of Portuguese as L2,"Mario Perini's reference grammar of modern Portuguese is probably fine as a work of descriptive linguistics that covers different varieties of contemporary Brazilian Portuguese ranging from the formal written standard to the educated familiar language and the substandard popular (uneducated) speech. However, I would not recommend this grammar as a textbook for students learning Portuguese as a second language. Although it is certainly useful for an advanced learner to be familiar with language variation within Brazil, it is probably safer for a student to stick with the standard language as found in the national newspapers or heard in the national TV newscasts. In fact, a student who masters the standard will have no problem understanding either the usual (urban) colloquial language or substandard (low-prestige) popular speech."
3,"Interesting but ""you gotta"" speak better!","I speak Portuguese and have spent some time in Brazil. I hope that my comments as an ex-learner (still learning though) will be of some good to new learners. This book contains a lot of useful information but the wrong emphasis. It considers three strands in the Portuguese language: formal writing; general use; and colloquial use. What is entered here as formal writing is what I learned at the university for general use. General use in this book includes colloquialisms like the use of ""te"" with ""voce"". What is colloquial use according to this book includes creole variations like ""nos chegamo"" or ""nos chegam'"" for first person plural ""nos chegamos"". This is not the standard you are looking for when you buy a grammar (this one is expensive) for guidance on the language you are learning. Comparing with English, it is like telling our EFL students ""that's what you gotta have"" anything else is too formal!"
1,If you want to learn Ghetto Portuguese this book is for you!,"Imagine a book called ""English Grammar"" which was based on the English spoken by the uneducated people of South Africa. This book is no better! The author had the audacity to call this a Portuguese Grammar, but it doesn't even deserve the name of a Brazillian Portuguese Grammar as it takes as its' standard the language from the ghettos of Brazil. If you want to learn correct Portuguese or read literary works in Portuguese then get the Portuguese Grammar written by Joseph Dunn - which is still the most comprehensive Portuguese Grammar in English. If you want to travel to the ghettos of Brazil and talk to uneducated people than this is your Book!"
2,interesting but not effective,"This was a great reference book, but not a favorite of mine. I bought this version for a primates class yet it only helped minimally. The suggested class texts by Collinge and Napier proved to be by far the most effective tools in our research,the actual cd-rom version was very nice b/c it was in color and photographs could be viewed easier. The resale value was poor also!"
2,not the best,"I think the CD-ROM would be great to have, but I can't find it anywhere! Noel Rowe's _Pictorial Guide to the Primates_ is much much better."
2,Not as good as the first.,"In the first Airport Tycoon you could view the aircraft when you signed contracts. Also you could watch them land and takeoff even when speeding up time. In this one the only time you can see them is when in real time.<--(I think this is also true for AT3) Even then the aircraft taxi, land and takeoff really fast and it is not very realistic looking.If you like airports and airplanes I would get the first one instead."
2,BORING DONT BUY,This game isnt really fun. I spent about a hour and thought it was boring. For some reason my game came with alot of bugs in it. The Taxiways where ficking. I like this game becuase i like to watch the take-offs and landings. Music is o right. I wouldnt get this piece of crap. WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE A GOOD AIRPORT TYCOON. I think Airport Tycoon the 1st one is better then this one.
1,this is the worst game,"The game stinks! you have to build a road or apron around every building. I was also looking for a 3-d display of the inside. instead, their is a weird graph thingy. I don't know If it is just my game, but all roads, aprons, etc., blinks. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A disapointment of a game,"I purchased this game because I thought it would be better than the poorly rated original. I don't think it rated any higher. Be careful that you check the game system requirements;if your computer is not new the program won't run. The music is impressive, the graphics are good, but the game itself is horrible. The tutorial mode isn't really a tutorial, and you have to figure out the game for yourself. The senarios are very difficult, and you don't know how to improve. The game has no comments on how to make your airport better, like in other games. You just have to guess what the programers want you to do. There seem to be a few technical problems with the game, and events happen for no reason. Overall, I would buy more tried and true games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, and if you happen to have money and time to waste, then buy this game."
1,Less gameplay than the original,"I am absolutely dumbfounded. The game looks very similar. The graphics are BARELY improved from the original. The gameplay is much less detailed.Basically, things you were able to do in the old game you can't do anymore. But there isn't any new stuff to do either.Utterly disappointed."
1,Dreadful!,"I think perhaps Airport Tycoon 2 is the worst game I've ever played. In fairness, I only played it for about an hour before I got so sick of it I gave up. I rather doubt I'll ever play it again.Airport Tycoon, the original, was a very limited game that still managed to be a little bit fun. Airport Tycoon 2 successfully removes everything that was fun in the original -- watching your planes and trucks drive around the airport, for example -- and gets rid of them. Even more astounding, the user interface and gameplay problems from the original have not been solved -- in fact, they've been made worse."
2,Worst tycoon,"Airport tycoon 2 looks like a really fun enjoyable game. Thats what it looks like on the back of the case, but beware it is one of the worst games I have ever bought. I could kick myself for buying it. Thought it was going to be good. The grapics are bad. When you build roads they aren't visible and break up in pieces in different areas as you move, then reappeare. Its a very good idea for a game but it really is a bad game. I'm giving it two stars because it tried. I imediately returned the game after playing it. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!"
1,This Game Sucks,"I have no other words to desribe this rather than: Waste of Money. It's a confusing, graphically cheesey, and just all around boring. The first on is a tycoon classic. This one will just hopefully go away!"
5,The Best Persian Reference Guide To Date.,"Easy to use. Table reference in the opening section gives a quick overview of the various regions. Good color illustrations coupled with comprehensive cross referencing makes this a ""must have"" reference book."
4,Good fun....for the first while anyways.,"I am not into giving a detailed review of every element of a game, so here's the short and sweet:Great RPG game, but it gets a bit repetitive, and you have to be in for the long haul if you want to finish the game, especially if you hope to get through every ""arena."" The game starts off great (and continues to play great- if you like turn based RPG's), with plenty of weapons and ""spells"" to use with the characters. But after awhile the incessant whining by some of the characters, combined with a sloooowww progression of the plotline, leave it to the gameplay to carry the game. And again, it's great initally, but after awhile it gets to be the same thing over and over. Then to boot, you find to get past a number of the arenas, you almost have to remake your gladiator school at times, requiring hours more playing to bring new characters up to speed.Definitely for the in-depth/long-game palyer, not the ""I'm looking for 20-30 hours of fun"" gamer."
3,"Good fun, but not enough choices!","I was looking forward to playing this game for some time... and when I finally did, I was pleased with the graphics and the voice acting was certainly much better then in most games. But I was disappointed with how little variation there was in the game, regardless of which characters you played.SPOILER:If you happen to be ""lucky"" enough to obtain the Hell's Gate skill, turn it off. You can run through the end of the game using this skill once, and I mean once, on everyone and everything. No fun..."
3,Mediocre at Best,"The graphics are very good, there's no doubting that. However, you do the same think over and over and over. There is no real plot until much later in the game. It gets boring after an hour or two of playing. You march from arena to arena fighting the same fights (very little variance). It is misleading to think you can create your character. You cannot. You must choose one of two preselected characters and recruit various different people/creatures."
3,Disappointing,"When I heard that the folks who put out KOTOR were doing a turn-based strategy, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, Gladius falls way short.There really isn't much to the strategy aspect. There are 3 classes of player size, and 4 classes of magic that apply to weapons and armor. You use these in deathmatch, king of the hill, capture the flag, and damage contests.Game play during combat is just like every other game where you swing something. Watch the little bar at the bottom of the screen and try to hit the button at the right time.Other than that, the graphics are good, but the music is repetitive. That's about all I can say.I gave it 3 stars because I did get about 7 hours play out of this, but most of that time was spent hoping it would get more interesting. Wish I had rented it first."
2,Like losing?,"Gladius plays like FF Tactics and Ogre Battles except for the fact that you start out every fight with a massive disadvantage. You will never get the first turn, the enemies will always get 2-5 turns for your one. It gets to be very frustrating losing simply because the other team is getting 4x more attacks than you. This game is not hard because you have to think or plan out a strategy its hard because the deck is stacked against you in every fight."
4,Based on Demo,"Like the others, I have only played the demo so far. Nonetheless, I see this game as having great potential. It is based upon this that I am rating it. The gameplay shows an insightful process for combat and character progression. Assumption: the rest of the game will complete and round out the demo.In the final version, I look forward to building a ""school"" of talented warriors and advancing my characters' ability, storyline, and wealth. The demo does not include shops to buy new equipment, which will also add value to the completed game. The goal of the demo is only to complete a few gladiatorial combats, but the game will have a full scheme of advancement with multiple and, I assume, sometimes divergent goals."
4,Cool turn based gladiator team battles!,"After playing the 3 Level demo featured on the Official XBOX Magazine, this game shows some excellent promise for a genre in need of a massive infusion. I really enjoy turn based RPG's and Gladius is blending that with some real-time elements that create a fresh sense of combat strategy. The player gets to pick a custom team of Gladiators with a mass of different abilities from weapons, to melee, to magic skills. As with any turn based RPG, strategy and planning is of the utmost importance which can take the brain power of a chess player to master.Hopefully, the final game will be well balanced to accomodate players who aren't that skillful and still step up the challenge to give the most mindful player a run for their money. This game so far is fun, engrossing and could very well take many days of your life...."
2,Doesn't work with my xbox 360,"I used to love this game, so I bought it to use with my xbox 360, and it doesn't work. Pissed me off royally that it doesn't work."
1,"Beware, Very Complex","I gave the game one star as an attention grabber. Pacific might be an excellent game for the advanced gamer who wants to delve into the extensive rules, but those looking for a quick, fun, playable game should look elsewhere. My 14 year old son and me play Axis and Allies Guadalcanal (and D-Day) and were looking forward to a larger version of that highly playable game. This game is Guadalcanal on steroids and requires a huge chunk of time to understand and play. As an example, the resolving combat rules are nearly four pages long with no graphic examples (that made these rules very confusing). The complete rules are 35 text intensive pages long. For us, where Guadalcanal was fun, Pacific was a slog that we finally just got tired of trying to figure out."
3,few options for Japan,"I have owned and played Axis & Allies for nearly 20 years. The number of strategic options for each side are nearly limitless and with two good players, the game can go on forever. I have never actaully kept count, but I am sure that some of my games have lasted at least 20 and perhaps as many as 30 rounds.The Pacific war version has been designed with such historic acuracy that it is actually impossible for Japan to win the war. So, the creators have had to include rules for ""victory points"". The Japanese player if forced to either make a mad dash to conquer India or Australia, or to just hold on to enough territory to earn the necessary points for victory before America builds its inevitable gargantuan force and crushes Japan.The game also has one more downside; it takes two people about 3 times as long to set up as the original Axis & Alllies."
2,Flaw in rules,"Axis & Alies Pacific would be an interesting game if not for the rules flaw. It is impossible to stop Japan from taking and holding India by the 4th turn. According to the rules, all Japan has to do to win is occupy one of the 3 capitals for 1 turn. The Allies do not have the resources to stop Japan from doing this. If you take this rule out of the game, it becomes an excellent game to play, but with this rule the Allies cannot win."
2,Burn out fast,There's a spot inside the top of the globe for an extra bulb. There's a reason for this... Buy in advance if you can't get them locally as you are going to need them.
5,Must have for 70s music fans,"I am a music historian with a large collection of music and books. This is easily one of the top 3 or 4 music books I have ever read. What makes this book special is Taylor's in depth examinations of each artist's impact on the era. He understands that Billboard chart positions cannot always be taken at face value, they can be both accurate and misleading. Many authors simply use numbers to tell the artists stories, but Taylor goes beyond this. His explanation of the impact of the first Teddy Pendergrass album is a perfect example. There were only two singles released from that album, but there were at least three more hits that drove the album's sales. This type of info, and more, is given throughout the book. I know alot about this type of music, and I can tell when an author really knows it too. Marc Taylor knows the music, did his homework, and wrote an excellent and informative book. I'm sure volume two is even better."
3,NON REALISTIC,"Ok to start off, this game is a very fast pace and fast action game; much like that off NFL Blitz. If your looking for realism, this is not the game ur looking for. Graphics... not bad, but the accuracy and precision you have to make is virtually nothing. A much more realistic game would be FIFA 2002 or 2003- more precise, realistic, and excellent game play. If you are looking for a game to just flat out hurt someone while getting soccer in there in the meantime, heres your game. Overall, it's a pretty good game, just not the type of soccer you may be looking for."
4,I really need this game,I would like to know if i can buy this game from you because i really want it and can't find it anywhere. please let me know if i can or not!
1,DULL,"We have a banking in the front yard of our new house which is impossible for my husband to mow because it's too steep and his age is getting up there. All summer it has grown weeds until I heard someone reference a grass whip, and this one had good reviews. I don't know what the other reviewers were cutting, but when I tried it out it wouldn't even bend the weeds over. I then tried it on regular lawn grass, and it would not cut that either. The blade can hardly be called that, because it is extremely dull; I couldn't injure myself if I wanted to on it. Wish I could find one that really worked! I'm returning this one."
4,"Good, but not for plastic corks","Works reasonably well on almost all cork corks, but don't bother with the plastic ones. It would be nice if the product was labeled clearly with that tidbit of advice.Also, if you know there is a lot of sediment in the wine, I wouldn't use the Cork Pop to open the vino."
1,Don't Buy-Junk,This is a collection of shareware for mainly outdated Pocket PC's. The software will not run under Windows Pocket PC 2003. Amazon should be ashamed for selling this kind of junk as their description of the product is very sparse.
1,Use caution with any product from this vendor!,"If you have not read the other reviews for Handango products, do so before you buy, as I wish I did. They have an iron clad return policy for defective or deceptive software, which they will be happy to share with you after you buy, and that is you bought it, you own it. There is no person to talk to on the phone when you try to reason with the company, and many of these products are nothing more than advertising for the web site based software. Not reccomended"
2,Dodgy...,"The blurb on the back reads ""The present world will end on 22 December 2012. So prophesied the Maya 5,000 years ago..."" - yet on page 4 the authors indicate that the Maya appeared around 500AD, which by my reckoning is only 1,500 years ago.Such internal inconsistencies riddle this book, and make it unreliable. On the face of it - and ignoring the 2012 prophecy, which uses some pretty tortuous mathematical manipulations - there is a lot of interesting information here about the Maya, but I'm afraid I just don't know how much I can believe or trust.I'm sure many people will lap up this book, and simply assume that the ""facts"" on the Maya must be true because they are written in an authoritative manner, but please keep an open mind - which includes remembering that the authors may be wrong."
4,Fascinating,"An adventure in ancient Mexico with full detail of the history of the Azdecs and Maya mainly, with many technical information at the appendices, try to decode many mysteries of the Maya civilization. Although i have many questions on the decoding of the lid of Palenque (sometimes it makes you think that during the decoding of the Lid, the authors should be drunk or something like that!) it gives you enough excitement to start or continue further research."
2,Dissapointed with ending,"I found the conclusion of the book to be inconclusive and feel that it is not based on any hard science; its the author's opinion supported by sketchy facts, figures and theories from other sources. It's artful and entertaining, but it's not like its going to leave you with the truth of 2012 being the end of the world.I don't regret reading it, however, and would recommend it to someone who is interested in learning about the subject. It just gives you one more opinion to chew on and ponder. And, I like pondering things.Futhermore, there is some historical information on the Central American Civilizations of the past, the Mayan calendars, as well as some interesting theories on Sunspot's."
5,"Sunspot cycles, modern solar astronomy and the ancient Maya?","I had heard of the ancient civilisation of the Maya that mysteriously vanished so long ago before but I had, previously, no understanding of the full extent of knowledge that the Mayans developed concerning the Sun and its influences. How did the Mayans of more than 1000 years ago know of the 1366040 day sun spot cycle that we have only just discovered? Does this prove that the Mayans are the decendants of an even older civilisation? Possibly Atlantis? In a study of ancient Mayan art and their undercredited calender system, M.Cotterell and A.Gilbert have provided me with a greater insight into the Mayans and have provided a valid explaination for their mysterious disappearence which can even be applied to today's civilistion as we may face a similar fate"
3,"Interesting conclusions, poor reading","Eschatology buffs and astronomers will probably find this book interesting. Although I found the conclusions of the book interesting, I thought the author took an extremely long time getting to the point. I found his journey a little boring and wish he would have spent more time explaining the consequences of the main point."
3,A must-see for Ingrid Bergman fans,"I watched the video two nights ago. The movie is recorded in EP mode, HI-FI. The sound is not very clear, and the story line is not very developped. However, I am a big Ingrid Bergman fan, and her being in it, is what makes the movie so enjoyable to watch. Too bad the picture isn't that clear either. But listen... for (this price) this movie is a well worth addition to my Ingrid collection!"
3,"Solid acting, so-so as drama","The plot: A grieving fortysomething widow (Ingrid Bergman) becomes entangled with a troubled young gambler (Rip Torn) in Monte Carlo circa 1900. The acting is fine, though the story lost much of its emotional impact in the translation from Zweig's novella to the small screen. The result is not a classic, but not awful either.The script is by John Mortimer, and the supporting cast includes John Williams and Jerry Orbach.This ""Revlon Presents"" drama special aired on CBS television in 1961. It was produced in a studio on videotape but survives here as a video-to-film transfer (kinescope recording). The Rhino VHS tape I bought was recorded at the slow speed, which means the picture quality is less than stellar. Still, as the other reviewer noted, Bergman is a pleasure to watch in just about anything, and it's interesting to see what Torn was like as a young actor just starting out."
4,Amazing book for anyone on a journey to reach Glstonbury.,This was a wonderful book for my trip to Glastonbury. It was full of rich facts and meditations. I wish I had read it before the trip so I could be prepared for the energy there. I was sweating a lot in the first few days. I would have liked to have done some of the work in this book earlier so I would have had a chance to intergrate everything.
2,"""Avalon Within"" Limiting","I purchased ""Avalon Within"" because of a growing interest in Goddess Spirituality and the concept of Avalon. I found the book to be pretty much what I had expected except for one crucial thing. I'm a man and author Jhenah Telyndru makes no mention of males belonging in the Avalon Tradition. She obviously initiates only women in her ""Sisterhood"". While the book was interesting, especially if one likes Celtic paths, it had limited value to me as a male. This is regretful since I have read other authors who include men in Avalonian circles. On a more positive note, the cover image is beautiful, if one likes judging a book by its cover."
2,A sleeper,"This book is very wordy and does not hold your attention. I find myself skipping pages to see if it gets any better? It does not. I wish I could return it. I have read many books on Avalon, this one put me to sleep. So if you have a hard time getting to sleep this is the book for you. Otherwise I would skip it."
3,"Great Episodes, Bad Tape","This is a review of this product:Extreme Ghostbusters Vol. 1 VHS. Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product, for which this review may not apply. After reading this review, please click on the link so that you can be assurred that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for.--------------------------------------------------While the Extreme Ghostbusters series is top-notch, this video falls below average because it was recorded in the SLP/EP speed - which is usually reserved for those ""low budget"" $3.99 tapes you find on the discount rack at your local supermarket. To make matters worse, Columbia/Tristar Home Video doesn't even tell you on the video box that it was recorded in this speed. Anyway, the episodes are at least worth the money spent on this tape. (Maybe we can all pray that they release this on DVD.)"
4,"Reflective, humerous, a change for Moore","Ever since I read ""Continental Drifter"" I have been an avid fan of Moore's writting (and comic) talent. His ability to play to me sense of humour is uncanny and has left me looking like a deranged, giggling, teary eyed loon whilst reading in public. This book seems like a slight change of direction for him. The humour is still there but it is somewhat muted and is not bursting out of every sentence as with his previous outings. Instead the book has a much more reflective tone (for Tim Moore that is) and is perhaps due to the envronment and people he walked with. It is a great book, I read it for the humour I expected from this author, I got the humour I wanted but got much more. ""Burn donkey Burn - Shinto inferno"". Great."
5,I loved it!,Oprah is a great actress and it is a shame that this series did not make it. I really enjoyed watching all the episodes. I wish there were more!
3,Average,"Unhooked Generation is a pseudo-sociological/social psychological look at the so-called issue of Generation X's lack of commitment in erotic relationships. Straus both promotes and denounces research to support her own views, which is a bit antithetical. Overall it's an entertaining read with catchy phrases and if you are out of the age bracket you'll get a lesson on Gen X's vernacular."
4,clear and pleasant,"well written, pleasant to read, interesting, nicely framed. interesting view on the relatively new phenomena of being single. well documented, extensive research (over 100 interviews). analysis of the data is clear, although somewhat conservative (in terms of marriage being the only real form of true commitment). insightful, certainly interesting for all sorts of singles."
3,Somewhat convoluted and hard to follow in some places made it so-so,"I looked forward to this book with great anticipation, but ultimately was somewhat disappointed.The plot twists and turns were not presented all that clearly, thereby making the story difficult to follow in some places. In some cases, I found that I had to go back to previous chapters to remember who was who and the context of their connection(s) to the characters in the current chapter I was reading.The author did not always indicate what the abbreviations he was using stood for, which would have been very helpful.Also, I did not quite *get* one of the revelations at the end; I won't say what this is so as not to give away anything to people who may be reading this review prior to reading the actual book!"
3,Just Okay!,"This was a pretty good but sometimes confusing novel. I just finished reading and all I can think of is how confusing it was at times. I just wasn't as satisfied as I was with this author's previous effort (The Last Family..totally awesome read). That being said, I did like the Massey character and look forward to reading what comes next with him. I just hope it doesn't leave me scratching my head."
2,Just Fair!,"I loved Miller's first book, The Last Family, and was very pleased to learn that after many years of waiting he wrote a new thriller called Upside Down. I bought an ARC of this book, which also included a second new thriller by him called Inside Out. Unfortunately, the high expectations I had for Upside Down were far from met; and my disappointment was so strong that I'm not sure if I'll read Inside Out. While Miller provides an abundance of action throughout the book, the dialogue he provides is so poorly written and his characters are so thinly developed and shallow that I found myself not caring enough about what was to happen next. The main area of suspense for me was to see if I could win the struggle to finish this disappointing book. While I won this ""battle"", I probably lost the ""war,"" as my confidence in an author for whom I had high hopes may be gone for good. Do yourself a favor and skip this book; but if you come across a copy of The Last Family, definitely read it."
4,new start,an interesting new series. Lots of coincidences. Let's see if the author can go new places.
5,Fascinating and inspirational,"Master Jones not only takes you on a journey from a young man growing up in Illinois to a Nationally known martial arts master but he also relates his philosophy in easy to understand accounts from real confrontations. He is one of those unique people who has been there but yet is humble in the great knowledge he possesses. Police officer, police academy instructor, karate instructor and most of all the true manifestation of a genuine master of the martial arts!Your martial arts library is not complete without this book."
5,Outstanding!!,"This is an outstanding book! It's easy reading and very interesting to hear the cop stories and how they relate to the martial arts. He tells the truth about what techniques worked and which ones did not. In addition, Master Jones says things that have needed to have been said for a long time regarding rank and conveys the true mind-set and philosophy of a warrior.As a long time martial artist it also brought back a lot of old memories of common experiences. I've read it a couple of times now (it's that kind of book), and I really enjoyed it.Add this one to your your library, no matter what your style or rank!"
4,"Good book, terrible editing","Another reviewer mentioned poor technical editing. My impression was that the code samples perhaps had a few syntax errors and wouldn't run without a bit of editing, and that the reviewer was probably being overpicky.My impression was wrong! This is the worst edited book I've ever read. There are mistakes throughout that seriously distract the reader from the content.This is unfortunate, because I thought the content was very good. If you are a statistically training data analyst, it might not go into enough depth, but if you are a database developer looking to bring data mining to your business/applications, this provides excellent coverage, from how to create the models to good descriptions and comparisons of the different algorithms SQL 2005 offers."
3,Theory-oriented book,"1) The book uses many examples based on the AllElectronics database. However, the book does not provide the AllElectronics database. Nowhere on the net where you can download AllElectronics database, even on the publisher website. This book is supposed to show us how to design and run data mining on SQL Server 2005, but it fails to do that since the examples in the book are not runnable. I've read many books about Data Mining for SQL 2005. All of them have runnable code except this book.2) At page 45, the author used the Customer_id as a data column in Customers table in database schema of a mini data mart, but later on, in the examples, he uses CustomerId as data column. In many places in the book, I found many inconsistencies between the database schema and the column names used in the query. Since the authors did not bother to provide the schema of the database, it is very confusing to keep track of what is going on after an MDX query."
1,Book Fails!,"This book was very poorly written. Some examples are marred by errors. Others are so poorly described as to be virtually useless. The authors may in fact be capable of clear and concise thought, but they are completely incapable of expressing clear and concise thought in their writing. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is typical of titles confined to a single vendor's tool. The focus is on this tool's features, not data mining. Learning the principles of data mining first will make a book like this unnecessary, and help you avoid pitfalls not covered by books like this one.If you want to understand data mining, get a real book on data mining, such as:""Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques, Second Edition"", by Witten and Frank ISBN: 0120884070or""Data Mining, Second Edition : Concepts and Techniques, Second Edition"", by Han and Kamber ISBN: 1558609016"
5,Mrs. Pollifax and the Second Thief,Gilman really twisted this one around with many humorous lines. enjoy Mrs. P a lot
1,no large print,"Book was and is still advertized as LARGE PRINT, but the book I received is not large print. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
1,"For Real Fans, This Set Is a Waste of Money","I thoroughly enjoy Scooby-Doo as much today as I did when it first arrived on television. This set, with the alleged ""Guest Stars"", is/was a real disappointment to me. The backgrounds are cheaply made. They look almost as cheesy as those of the Steamboat Willy and other early cartoons. The colors are washed out. When being pursued by the bad guys, the same backgrounds appear repeatedly as Shaggy and Scooby flee.The voice characterizations of Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, and The Harlem Globetrotters sound like amateur night at an elementary school play.Unless one is attempting to complete a Scooby-Doo collection, skip this set."
1,Broke,"I was really excited to find this, however it was broken. The discs looked perfect, but none of them would work in any electronic device I had. My computer wouldn't even recognize it being in the disc drive"
2,Why this series?,"After the extras-light release of the first and second seasons of the original Scooby Doo Where are You, you might have expected the Scooby box-sets to continue in a similar vein ie. the good shows. Instead we are given 'the best of (bad news for completists) The New (hardly) Scooby Doo Movies (oh, dear)'.The 'special' guests with a few exceptions will be unrecognisable to modern audiences (Who is Speed Buggy daddy? Mom, do you know who Phyllis Diller is?) and the show, even in the 1970's was pretty weak.Extras have yet to be announced but apparently there is some sort of decoder competition type thing - obviously to get you to buy the thing.I had hoped that the releases would have continued with the basic Scooby Doo mystery shows instead of moving on to the gimicky ones but at leaset we are still being spared Scrappy Doo!"
2,This could have been better,"Ok - I was a sucker - I was looking forward to this set, but was somewhat dissapointed. If you look at the opening titles, they are not the original titles, like many speculated, WB/HB probably do not have the DVD rights from the likeness of the stars...so the Addams Family, etc are edited out of the opening...With the vast vault of HB material, it would have been nice to get a bunch more extras...maybe features on how the series came about, what it was like working with the celbrities..etc. Other than that, being a 3 Stooges fan, it is nice to see them on DVD but would like to see the other stars..."
4,Great DVD..brings back a lot of good memories,"My kids are on a Scooby Doo kick and this was more that they had not seen. In some Amy's we enjoy these better than the regular versions. Batman and Robin, globe trotters and others are great shows."
3,not the best of !,I love Scooby Doo and these are great episodes but there missing some great ones from this set like when they meet the Addams Family or my personal favorite where they meet Sunny And Sher! I hope they just release the whole series on dvd because i will definatly buy that and give this set to someone else!
4,"Great, But the Set Needs to be Complete","In any released set (especially from shows that were aired ages ago), it should always be complete. For the price you pay, there should never be a missing episode.So a ""best of"" translates to ""not complete"". What's provided here is top-notch stuff if you're a fan. In fact, some of my personal favorites ARE included. But the set is still not complete, so some of your favorites may be missing. Review the episode list provided by others before you buy.But for those of you who will take ANY classic Scooby episode you can get, this is for you. For me personally, I'm a beggar, so I suppose I can't be too choosy. But I'm greedy enough to want it all, not a ""best of""."
3,OK For a Not Complete Set,"I have a 6 year old daughter who thinks Scooby-Doo is the greatest. It is unfortunate that those episodes that were not included in the ""Greatest"" collection are some of the best. I especially missed the Addams family. I was only a baby when Scooby came out, but I love the shows as does my child. I hope we do get a second volume of the best of scooby-doo movies."
3,Do it right and don't cheat your customers,"While I am pleased that studios are digging deeper into their vaults and bringing back these classic shows, why should I pay for more ""best of"" when I want ""complete"". The Scooby Doo Movies gave us longer episodes, with some big name guests (for 1972) and made one great show. 5 stars out of 5 for content, but -2 stars for the poor distribition methods."
4,Included Episodes,"I pre-ordered mine 2 weeks ago. I examined the episodes included and couldn't understand why the folks didn't include the omitted episodes. They included some good ones but they should have at least kept the pink/red ending backgrounds together like the Don Knotts ones and the Sonny & Cher, etc., and the blue ending backgrounds together like the Don Adams, Tim Conway, Josie, Speed Buggy, etc. I gave it 4 stars because I love seeing the older cartoons being released. I now would like to see the original Space Ghosts, Frankenstein Jr/Impossibles, The Herculoids, Mightors, the Batman/Superman Hours (1968), JLA (1967), Secret Squirrels, etc. I can't wait for the Perils of Penelope and the Dastardly & Muttley ones.Larry"
4,video,"these were great for the purpose that they were purchase for, grandson really love the series and they worked well"
2,Waste,"I saw the epsiode of Laurel and Hardy and I really enjoyed it. I love Three Stooges and Batman and Robin so I bought this set. I really made a mistake in buying this set. I dont know when these movies were made but I wish they would have the real Three Stooge voices, seeing how they were making cartoons around this time as well. Batman and Robin just look plain awful and the rest of the set is really bad. I own the first set, the orginal Scooby Doo show and thats the only set that fans need."
1,Scooby Movies Bah!,"I'm a big fan of Scooby but these episodes were played to death on cartoon network especially The Harlem Globetrotters and Laurel and Hardy.i wouldn't be surprised this is all the Scooby movies they put out, I mean the Tom and Jerry Collection wasn't complete and Uncut which totally sucks. Here's something that's strange Hanna Barbera put out the classic cartoons why cant they put out the new cartoons like The Addams Family cartoon that was shown in the early Nineties and Bill and Teds Excellent Adventures. Also were is the Smurfs MR T Dragons Lair and Space Ace and Pacman along with Saturday supercade and The 13 Ghosts Of Scooby Doo. Never mind what they want to put out they should listen to what the fans want instead were the ones that buy them."
4,Takes You Back To Childhood Fun,"Only draw back is that it doesn't have all the ""Scooby Doo"" movies. Like the one with Sonny & Cher, or Tim Conway, etc.Still a fun CD."
5,Scooby Doo Rules!,"These Scooby Doo movies are the greatest. So many guest stars and funny as ever. If you loved these cartoons as a youngster than you will love these even more as an adultster. Scooby Doo and the gang will never fail to put a smile on your face. As for solving the mystery...this mystery is solved, you have to buy this collection. These DVD's are a dream to watch, so crisp and clear. The gang is so timeless, even after all these years."
4,I liked it,"I wish this DVD included the Addams Family episode and Sonny and Cher as well. Other than that, I enjoyed it."
4,Scooby Doo,It was a good buy but I agree that they should have put other guest star movies on there since they had already release Glober Trotters and the Batman ones.I really wish they would release the rest of the Scooby Doo Movies. It would be nice to see them all and in order of when they aired.
4,no diller????,I have yet to purchase this and so i will not even attempt to make a review as it wouldnt be fair to the customers. I just wanted to say i was disappointed to see that the phyllis diller episode didnt make it. I have only seen a few episodes from this series of scooby but i always loved the phyllis diller episode. how many 24 year olds love phyllis diller???
3,Where are the rest? Thanks for Don Knotts!,"Bought this dvd set with one of my favorites ""Guess who's Knott coming to Dinner"" but where are the rest? I am very dissappointed to see many episodes missing and others like the Globetrotters and Batman and Robin on here! You have already released those on DVD (I have those already). Come on Warner Brothers! You are missing the Sonny and Cher, Jerry Reed and the Adams Family oh and don't forget Sandy Duncan, Phillis Diller and Genie and Babu episodes! You better release those on a seperate DVD set. Get it right for those of us who like the series we had watched when we were kids! Please release those on a seperate DVD!"
3,"Good idea, but how do you use it! Cuts my hands...","This product is a great idea. However, aside from a ""tug bags into the holder from the top"" instruction I found on the internet (there are not instructions or illustrations that comes w/ the product), how is the best way to insert bags inside? I simply shove them inside from the top hole, which scrapes my fingers as I shove bags in and sometimes when I reach for the bag to pull the out. Not comfortable. I've shaped the bags into balls, inserted them flat by shoving them insider though the middle of the bags, inserted them from one end only...not sure. It seems there most be an easier way or else keeping all the bags in one plastic bag in your shelves seems to be an easier idea."
2,There's a better alternative,"While I'm a firm believer that everything has it's place, I believe that my wife came up with a better/cheaper alternative than simplehuman. Empty Kleenex or tissue dispensers work perfectly. Only one bag comes out at a time, and they come in enough sizes/colors/patterns to match any decor."
3,Difficult to use,"Getting the bags INTO the holder is easy enough, but getting them out again is rather difficult. Frequently when I attempt to remove a bag tugging on the bag just causes the holder to lift up off the ground and I end up holding it by a bag.. It is visually appealing, and if you just start by picking it up in one hand and removing the bag with the other it's fine but I think next time I will try the wall mounted one."
3,Freed up a drawer in my kitchen,"It looks nice and holds a lot of bags. Good thing, we use at least one a day for litterbox waste. Is it perfect? Nope, I'd like something that'd give me one bag at a time. Still, it's better than throwing the bags away and it's attractive. The spouse was using one before that looked kind of like a toilet seat, which just didn't appeal to me at all.Rebecca Kyle, August 2008"
3,Perfectly good box with two holes,"It ""works"" inasmuch as it accepts plastic bags in the top hole and allows you to pull them out through the front hole. Don't know if it's necessarily worth the SimpleHuman premium price... you can probably buy one for a few bucks at the grocery store that would be just as good."
5,Holder,excellent!!!! The holder makes storage of plastic bags easy and neat; fits nicely on a shelfand keeps an orderly appearance
5,Simple Human Upright Grocery Bag Holder - Brushed - LOVE IT!,"Great product. Fits perfectly in the space I have. Holds a LOT more bags than I thought it would. Great, sturdy organizational piece. Good value! Shipped on time and received on time. Great purchase!"
4,Simplehuman makes nice stuff,I have a few other Simplehuman items in my kitchen area. They are almost always high quality from what I've seen.This little guy helps me to reuse all those plastic bags in a compact and good looking container. It's easy to stuff new bags in and easy to take bags out.
5,One of my favorite books,"I am surprised at the reviews that see this book as anti-science. Science is a tool of logic that can measure reproduce-able events, and test them by theory-hypothesis-results, leading to a new theory-hypothesis-results leading to an accumulation of tested knowledge than can be acted upon. This is great - I love science. But Schumacher puts science in the context of our larger psychological (or spiritual, if you want) world. Science has nothing to say about one-time or non-measurable events. This book does. It describes a much bigger world that has gotten lost by our over emphasis on left-brained thinking. A REALLY good book."
4,A Guide for the Perplexed,"This book is a wonderful defense of western values. If you know anyone who is wrestling with atheism or agnosticism, this is the book for them. If you want to introduce anyone to the joys of philosophy, this is the book for them. If you want to give a book to someone that enjoys philosophy, this is the book for them. I completely agree with one reviewer that this book deserves ""a place in the college curriculum."""
5,"A wonderful, life-changing book","I read this book about 10 years ago and I still read it again and again. The author widens our perspective on science and point to the fact that 3/4 of reality can not be investigated by conventional scientific methods. I am a scientist and I read thousands of scientific reports and also report some myself. When I read this book I instantly felt that the author was absolutely right about the limitations of conventional science. Thus, his book changed my whole perspective of science and I started to investigate the ""other areas"". I have never regretted that. This book is beautifully written. It is one of my 3-4 favourite books which I very often take out from the bookshelf to read in silent mornings when the family is asleep. I recommend this as a first read of my favourite books. It is particularly important reading for scientists."
5,The best money you'll ever spend ...,"Today, our culture is awash with advice. Psychiatrists, diet regimes, book reviews ... there's too much information for us to handle.So how can I put this without sounding smug, superior, patronising ?This is the only book that I would beg somebody to read. Enough said.(his other books are astonishing too !)"
1,Mildly Perplexed,"Wasn't ""A Guide For The Perplexed"" authored by the 12th Century Jewish philosopher Maimonides? Couldn't Mr. Schumacher at least have found an original title for his book?"
1,A poorly constructed attempt to prove religion's supiriority,"I have no idea how anyone could enjoy this book. Schumacher uses bad ""logic"" to prove that logic is usless, then uses even worse logic to prove that he is correct. He begins by assuming that God exists and humans were created superior to all animals and then ""proves"" these points through circular logic. The best use for this book in in the out house, and even that might be flattering it. The title is apt, at least. You would have to be perplexed and extreamly stupid to agree with the author."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I was looking for some ways to clear up acne, something that I could do without going to a doctor. This book is really more about the emotional impact of acne and how to deal with it. It really doesn't give any new advice about clearing up your skin. I did not find it helpful."
3,This book is good for mild to moderate acne,"I have pretty bad acne so using the home remedies and over the counter products listed in this book didn't help much. So, I went to see Dr. Fried himself and I am now using perscription medication. I haven't been on the medication long so I can't tell you if the medications have worked yet, but maybe at a later date I could let you know. The book is helpful to track the reasons why we get acne and what the causes are. And it gives you understanding that you are not the only one. I feel this book is more for people who are not constantly worring about their skin. It is more for ""light"" acne. If you are depressed about your face then my advice would be to go see the dermatologist and get it over with. I believe that this a great book for understanding your acne but not a good book for curing it."
5,Very pretty and informative book,"Look at the Images above: I uploaded several of the many, many pictures so you can see how richly illustrated the book is. I didn't know that much about Persian art beside woven and knotted carpets. My roommate in college was from Tehran, Iran, however, so I learned a little Farsi. (I know how to say ""hello"" and ""I love you!"") Anyway, she didn't have much background into the history of Persian art and I think she'd really appreciate this book.Melding the art with the history is a very engaging way to study both. The highlights and low points of the politics and social situation of the 2 centuries are directly reflected in the art. I really enjoy it that all media are represented whether paintings, ceramics, tiles, carpet, engravings, sculptures, etc.I recommend this book. Very entertaining, enlightening, and enjoyable."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is a horrible waste of trees. Aside from the errors and omissions, it is condescending, thin in content (filled out with quizzes that take up many of the pages), and generally useless for any meaningful introduction to or overview of chemistry. I would give it zero stars if that were an option. Try the old workhorse ""Chemistry Made Simple"" instead."
1,So. Many. Errors.,"Aughh, I can't believe I bought this book without reading reviews first! I had found the Precalc Demystified book to be very helpful, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with another one in the same series. Wrong!!! I am on Chapter TWO, and so far there have been so many ridiculous errors that I just can't continue with the book. Because of all the errors (and then the creeping, nagging feeling: is *that* an error, or is my understanding wrong??) the book has pretty much been an impediment to understanding. I have spent more time on the internet clarifying concepts, and with pen and paper re-working the bizarrely wrong example calculations, than I have spent learning from the book. I only wish I had not begun to make margin notes in it, because now I can't return it. :("
4,A must have for chemistry beginers,"This book clearly explains all of the most elemenatary chemistry concepts which are very important to understand if you plan on learning anything past the chemistry one level. I bought this book for help with a chemistry 2 class, which is still considered general chemistry at most schools. This book does not explain anything beyond the most general and elementary concepts."
2,"Good format, but not written or edited by a chemist!","It has a good format and appropriate depth, but it's like it was written by a first year B-average chemistry student on a tight deadline. I forced my way through it cover to cover but I think I got more from the challenge of spotting the logical and factual errors than from the info it's self. It's just page after page of mistakes, self contradicting paragraphs, inaccuracies, some plainly false statements,(like ""[solids] do not expand when heated"") and oddly confusing phrasing and analogies that seem like the author is speaking to a child.(The analogy thing actually gets worse with each chapter.)I actually picked this up at the library as I like to test drive books before purchasing them, and I need a refresher and general reference some 15 years after my last class. It is the 2003 edition with a periodic table inside the cover."
5,Good & Simple Refresher / Tutor,"This book is a good refresher or tutor for the student struggling in school. It is not overly complex, which at times is what keeps people from ""getting it."" It is written ""a notch lower"" than the textbooks for ease of use and understanding. I purchased this book for my daughter who was struggling - she picked it out from several. It helped her tremendously and she brought up her grades to ""A"" level!"
1,Poorly Written,"I have taken chemistry before, but wanted a simple refresher. This book looked good in the store--I liked the general format and progression of topics. Once I got into it however, I was really disappointed. I got through chapter 3, decided it wouldn't get any better, and then returned it for a refund. The two reviewers ahead of me were on the money. Save yours for another book!"
1,If you really need solid answers - this is not the option,"First off I must say I have found the ""Demystified"" series of publications helpful in general. Chemistry Demystified fails in that someone did not do some critical proofreading of the text. At first I thought it was just one instance of an error, but the time I reached Chapter 7 I had doubts about the entire content of the book and thought, ""If a student were depending on this information to save a grade - they might be at greater risk."" Whether it was a simple error in a math formula (which was my first clue), to questionable information about the filling of electon orbitals, then finally when an element identified by its Atomic Symbol of Br was named Beryllium in a problem, it was time to stop. This is not the book I would recommend to someone that was really counting on help."
1,Disgusting,"I seldom write review, but this book is so badly written that I really want no other person suffers the same mistake I made. I originally bought this book from Costco for my 10th grade son. This book is full of mistake. I am an engineer and I could not believe this book is so useless and might provide wrong information to students."
1,Shameful,"Full of ambiguous language and outright errors. Seems like a classic case of a publisher taking no interest in content, only sales potential. Was this book edited by anyone knowing anything about chemistry or editing? Not recommended under any circumstances."
1,Too many errors,I've had the book for a couple days now and will be returning it. There are far too many errors to be a reliable self-teaching guide.
1,Disappointed with this book,"This was a poorly written book and like many of the previous reviewers, I found this book filled with errors and relatively useless information. While it does indeed cover a lot of basic concepts, if you're looking to try and understand the concepts, the book will fail miserably.While reviewing the quizzes I find myself constantly going back to the chapter to see if I had missed anything only to see that the chapter simply didn't cover the material.I'm quite a fan of the other demystified books like differential equations, but this book I'm afraid would lead to false sense of self confidence."
2,"Another disappointing ""Demystified"" book",I'm a librarian who specializes in selecting adult material for a number of public libraries across the country. I've been covering science topics lately and have noticed many titles in the Demystified series being poorly reviewed by professional journals and by Amazon readers. I'm mystified as to what the McGraw-Hill editors are thinking. Here is yet another hastily-assembled title. Many readers have already identified its flaws. The professional library review journal LIBRARY JOURNAL does not recommend this title. I would caution libarians and Amazon shoppers to carefully evaluate any title from this series before purchasing it. There are several alternative titles that do a much better job than this book.
3,Good reading - but not too detailed,"Though this book does cover Newton's life and lives up to its name - Newton in 90- minutes ( I finished the book in 60 minutes though) it does not provide the reader with more elaborate details about Newton's life. The style is pacey and holds you throughout. No doubt it is a well written book but throughout you will feel as if more information could have been provided. I dont know if there is a more detailed biography of Newton available or not, but I would prefer reading something more detailed about Newton. Most of the stuff in the book would be known to any reader of scince wih interest in the development of scintific thought. This is for someone who doesnt much about Newton and doesnt want to spare more than 90 minutes knowing about him........."
4,Small but impactful,This book is smaller that I expected but doesn't take away from it's content. I plan on giving it as a teacher gift and think it would be appreciated.
5,positive thinker,"Great book! Although I didn't agree with all of the quotes, over all it was a great read. Inspirational! Very in line with the bible too! :-) Enjoy...I did!"
5,healthy lunch,"The meal is healthy, self contained, and reasonably priced. what's not to like? oh yeah- it seems to no longer be available. c'est domage!"
5,THis is my most favorite CD,"I love this CD. Especailly, track#6 (Double Cello Concerto for 2 cellos RV531 by Vivaldi) is killing my heart. I will buy more to give friends as gifts."
3,What happened to Love?,"This reissue of Bruce's classic work does what the title says it will do: address the work of Christ in the past, present, and future. Although Bruce grounds his work in Scripture citing text after text, it is odd how scarce the word ""love"" appears. What more central work did Jesus do than to reveal the love of God? Although the book was apparently designed for helping laity study the Bible, this book has the feel of a courtroom rather than a dynamic, love relationship. It is useful for dotting ""i""s and crossing ""t""s but not so much for melting, healing, or inspiring hearts."
2,Doesn't include the pole...,The flag is what I expected...no pole though...would be nice to have the pole included. It comes with a couple of suction cups. Now I have to buy the pole. Picture clearly shows a pole.
1,Oil Painting Training,"This one is hard to review. The artists is very good but the video is not well made. The editor cuts in with a picture on picture that not only blocks the view of the artist but is either 3 steps ahead of what the artist is doing or behind the artist. It is just a badly made video with arbitrary cuts. An area is never finished before the artist starts something else but when you look that area later it is done. Constantly bad cuts all over. I like the artist. He can teach some very good methods but its just aggravating to watch. I don't know, I feel bad that the video is so poorly made but I do like the artists and if you want to take a chance, its only a few bucks. Oh, and it didn't play on my DVD player I had to watch it on my computer but its not where I paint so that's an inconvenience too."
1,Not my cup of tea,When I heard Cinnamon Park I thought I was hearing a the new Weird Al Yankovich not the new Sharyl Crow. Ill keep it short as I just might be ill.
5,Where God Was Born,"This was a fascinating and educational book. I learned so much from readingit and although the author referred many times to the Hebrew Bible, I found the King James version very similar to the scriptures he quoted. The main thing however; was his ability to describe all the biblical sites he visited. I bought the book from Amazon.com at a great price because I wanted to make notations and underline. The book is well worth any price."
1,Sign of our times,"Today, our culture scoffs at believing the Bible, as a result it is not at all fashionable to actually read it. So, unsurprisingly, it is a sign of our times that this book's many mistakes would go unnoticed by the vast majority.Feiler's book is an engrossing travelogue. He takes us to many of the sites referenced in the Bible and helps make them come alive with his narrative. However, even as a newcomer to Bible study, I caught several errors just in the first few chapters.Had this book been written 50 years ago, I think even the most secular editor would have sent the book back for a rewrite. How can we take Feiler's points seriously, when he can't get even the basic facts straight?"
4,Where scripture was born,"Bruce Feiler is at heart an investigative journalist - his first books were about teaching in Japan, attending Oxford and Cambridge, and performing as a clown in a circus - but the books that have made him famous are about Biblical history, and how that history impacts us and applies to us today. In Where God Was Born, my favorite of the three that I've read so far (the others are Walking the Bible and Abraham), Feiler travels to war-torn Iran, Iraq, and Israel in order to discuss the Biblical beginning of the world and the worldly beginnings of the Bible. Reading about early religious wars in Feiler's books almost makes it possible to believe that a contemporary world without those wars is possible."
2,Slight of Hand....,"I'll approach this from the standpoint of writer and engineer because a number of people have already amply tackled the Biblical aspect. If you read this book, read it carefully and with a critical eye. There were far too many times when the author implied ""if A then B"" when the result was by no means justified. Secondly, there were too many occasions where he took the end result and worked backwards to show how the forces colluded to achieve the result, much in the same way modern conspiracy theorists like to show that existing conditions are the carefully laid plot of someone's nearly improbable actions. I doubt that ancient man gave his existence nearly as much anthropological consideration as Feiler seems to have thought they had.I enjoyed parts of the journey because I used to live in the area, and it brought back memories, but beyond that there were too many anomalies to draw real historical information or philosophical learning from."
2,discouraging,This book lacks photographs something critical to his descriptions. Perhaps it is an attempt to force readers into buying his other books.Secondly the reader does not know what Bible he is using the hebrew one or the christians one. he does not have a good understanding or knowledge of the bible claiming David did not kill Goliath!!his interpretations of the Bible are incorrect clearly using his human wisdom rather than a spiritual God given one.He clearly often criticises Christians and is supportive of the Jews and Muslims. almost as if to attack them.I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not have clearl biblical foundation and understnading as it will mislead many.
5,Traveling Thru Time,"I thoroughly enjoy reading Bruce Feiler's journeys in the Bible lands and his insights. It doesn't matter that he is Jewish and I am a Christian. I learn so much about the Old Testament it makes me want to research the Bible further and gain my own perspective using this book as a useful tool.I agree with the editorial reviews. I find every bit of the book fascinating as Bruce uncovers little known details of ancient times. His recent visit to Iraq and Iran - how courageous. My thanks to him and also to his wife for sharing their thoughts and for their desire for unity and peace among all peoples.Hopefully, the journey will continue thru the New Testament lands. I look forward to this author's next book."
4,A unexpected benefit in this gorgeous narrative....,"This is a beautifully written book from start to finish. Making the biblical characters come to life....however:It also gave an unexpected result. After seeing how Jews and Muslims interpret the stories of the Old Testament, it assured me, beyond anything else I've read, that the Christian faith is the only sensible interpretation of the prophesies of old. The author works so hard at stretching the meaning of these stories, that he misses the obvious....A recommended read for any Christian who is interested in the biblical history of the nation of Israel, as long as you start with a reference bible in hand (as it's easy to see where the author misinterprets many old testament passages).Overall, a beautifully written journey. Hopefully the author will tackle the life of Christ next, and his natural instinct to inquire into Biblical history will lead to the clarity he is obviously seeking."
5,A must read for serious thought.,"Anyone who is interested in completely understanding how the religious current events today can effect how we successfully proceed from here on, needs to read ""Where God Was Born."" Bruce Feiler's plea is that all faith's return to what they drew from at their birth, coexistence with each other."
3,Disappointing but fun,"I received Football 2003 as a throw in with Baseball Mogul 2004 and made the mistake of playing Baseball 2004 1st. A lot of the features and enhancements that made Baseball 2004 so enjoyable appeared to be in Football 2003 but simply did not work. I agree with the assessment that it is buggy because post season awards and cumulative stats were definitely missing, I guess it would be good for those with Alzheimers. I loved the Football Mogul 1998 and was hoping for the quantam leap especially after playing Baseball but it didn't happen. Next year will be a crucial version as to the improvements which will decide future purchases."
3,I thought this was a good story,"Although Charlotte created many of her own problems by all the little white lies she told, still, I thought her desire to be three-dimensional was reasonable, everyone in her family was as irritating as heck, and she was admirable in her continual determination to prevent them from flattening her. Character development and plot movement were decent. I did think her son was a sanctimonious, selfish hypocrite who never got called on his behavior and never changed for the better (unlike the other characters who finally lightened up a bit)."
4,kept me reading,"I felt with each page something new developed. I enjoyed this book. There were twist and turns with every chapter and i wanted to keep reading to find out what was happening next. If you are looking for a book about family secrets,and drama. Read this book"
2,not great,"I wasn't too enthralled with this book. It was kind of hard to keep reading, but I make myself finish any book just in case things get better or there is a poetic phrase or two that I love and want to remember.So, I kept reading, but really didn't enjoy the story. It was too contrived. And in parts, the writing seemed so juvenile. I did find a couple of good statements to make me think about religion, so I am glad I read the book."
1,"The tale of a woman wondering ""What could have been?""","As much as I enjoyed this book for its literary beauty and possibilities, I found the story to be depressing and dark. A woman who essentially feels she's wasted her entire life and has a sordid affair with a man young enough to be her son is hardly the story I would recommend to someone looking for a captivating story. I suppose I sound judgemental, but it seems we should be reading spiritually uplifting stories that encourge the sanctity of marriage, not encouraging women to pine for what could have been. The more I write this review, the more I've just decided I really didn't care at all for this book!"
3,nice but tiny,My wife can just barely get this watch on her wrist. The band is soo small she has to take her wedding ring off to get it on. If her hands get swollen after typing all day she can't get it off.
5,Love this Book!,"I am so glad I got a copy of this book when it was still in print, and I hope for the sake of other cocktail nerds out there that they reprint it. This book has great recipes, along with a detailed history for each - its fun to read, and the recipes were all carefully chosen (and good).Get it if you can!"
5,A truly great book full of truly great drinks,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a couple of internet forums and the amazon reviews. This book is an absolute joy, and the drinks that it includes are uniformly well-crafted and delicious. I've had probably 1/3 of the drinks included in the book so far, and each of them has been a treasure. The most difficult thing about these recipes is finding the ingredients. We have a very good liqour store near here, Eagle's Landing Bottle Shop. They had enough ingredient to get me through these first drinks. I'm now working with them to order some new ingredients. My only caution is that you will drink more and spend a lot of money on liqeurs and mixers that you have never heard of. On the positive side, many of those are delicious by themselves."
4,Early Settlers in Kit Carson Colorado,I was so happy to find this book because is has been out of print for many years. Some of the families written about in this book include my grandfather and his family.I found several school photos of my dad and aunts and uncles which are priceless treasures to me. Thank you AMAZON.COM for the wonderful service you provide.
2,"Comprehensive overview of policies, presented as persuasive essays","A very comprehensive review of current criminal justice system policies. Details what has worked and what has not worked, in a moderately fair manner, in general.The book's main fault is that in several instances, conclusions are drawn as to the reasons why certain programs or certain policies succeeded (or failed), and politics often are brought into the discussion. There are some moments in which some of the authors' statements, presented without any cited studies or lacking footnotes, may appear somewhat speculative or even biased to the reader.On the whole, a decent overview of the many directions the criminal justice system has taken as well as a decent look at some of the policies foisted onto the CJS by the politics of the last fifty or so years."
2,"Should be titled ""The war against conservativism"".","Without doubt the book is well written and the authors do an amazing job of using ""smoke and mirrors"" to convince readers that their analysis of the criminal justice system is true and factual. However, I have never seen a more perfect example of an author intentionally manipulating data and statistics to support his or her opinion.Besides the clear political bias of the author, there are even a number of blatant factual errors. For example, look hard enough and you will find that the same exact bar graph is erroneously used twice in the book for two entirely different studies.This is NOT a history book. Nor should it be used as such. It has a very clear purpose and that is to demonize conservatives and those who are ""tough on crime""."
3,Eco Feminist Study,"This was a useful book if Ecofeminism is your subject. It was one of the recommended books for the Radical Readings module of Exeter University's Theology degree. It does give another voice to add to the inevitable Rosemary Radford Reuther's. Unfortunately, I managed to accidentally purchase two copies so if anyone wants one - let me know.Ann Butcher"
1,I am so ready for an apocolypse,"Just when you thought every rediculous theory had been put into print, here comes Sally McFague and her organic model of political correctness. Can we please have more new definitions for everyday reality? Before I read this book, I had no idea that I was a morphic descendent of the protozoan patrea conspiracy. If you don't already hate old white men in America, and you're looking for a reason to, buy this book, and get your carpet cleaned by Sally McFague."
4,Teach Yourself Greek Conversation (3CDs + Guide) (TY: Conversation,This program is ok..... I wish there was an easier way to learn Greek... In order to be good you really got to practice it.... It can be over whelming but it can be done.
4,"crazy, quirky love story","I love this movie. I didn't really know what to expect before I saw it the first time. What you end up with is a crazy, technicolor collection of vignettes. At its heart though it is a sweet love story. Pod, the protagonist, is a sweet, lovable character, very well-played. His facial expressions are the mark of a very good actor.As a big fan of Thailand it is always fun to see the country in film. I love to see all of the places in Bangkok where I have been.This is definitely an arty/indie film that is not for everyone. But if you like oddball, quirky films I think you will enjoy Citizen Dog."
1,Not the osmanthus that I know,"Osmanthus is a rare flower that grows only in hot tropical climates. In US it can only be found is parts of Louisiana and Georgia. It's white flowers are as potent as they are beautiful. But this perfume is disappointment. It's additions of musk, rose and vetiver overpower delicate osmanthus flower. Bottle is large and has plenty of perfume, but within the week, the potency of the perfume disappears. You end up havign big bottle of yellowish tonic water.Save yourself some money and buy something else. I am absolutely disappointed with this perfume."
5,Great,"This item is an exact fit for my car. It replaces a worn out bushing that looks good but lacked the strength to hold the rack in place. this item was not available at any parts store in my area, so you guys saved the day. Great fit."
4,Surprisingly good,"I didn't expect much from this game. It was a replacement for a videopoker and slots combination from Masque that had gotten lost. The graphics on this disc are verty good. I can't comment much on the sound since I keep that turned off most of the time. There is a wide choice of slot machines, several with extended play/bonus features. The one major drawback is the necessity to keep the disc in the drive while you play the games."
2,Fake Gambling,"This is not nearly as much fun as other slot games I've ordered. Amazon's service was as always excellent, but the games on this program can't compare to others."
1,bally slots,I was really disappointed with this game. The graphics are not good and it's just not that fun to play.The real deal series of slot games is much better.
3,Computer Slot Game Review,"Not wht I thought, but my daughter likes it. Thought it had games that it did not have. Must have misread it."
5,The Red Baron Flies Again!,"This is my first ""expensive"" kite and the reason I bought it was because I was so impressed by the colors when I saw it displayed in a shop, that I just couldn't resist. The price was good, but this site is better.I must say that when I flew it for the first time recently here in Lancaster, SC, I was amazed! You don't need another person to help, just hold it up and let the tail take the breeze which will right the plane instantly in the wind. It flies easily and stable, and the sight of it flying in the sky is impressive, to say the least. It REALLY draws attention! One guy pulled over in a truck and said, ""Now THAT is a KITE!"" I have to agree with him - it's a sight to see!!"
3,Mixed Review,"This kite looks really cool. The design is awesome, and it's sure to turn some heads. The thing is, that it is hard to fly. When I was attempting to fly it with friends, everyone was able to get their kites in the air. The red baron on the other hand, seemed to be too heavy, and probably needed stronger wind.I would suggest to buy this kite if the wind is strong, like on a beach."
4,A Fun Flyer,"This is a neat kite.I have four very differant kites,from novelty kites like this one,to dual and quad line kites.It does take alot of wind to fly this kite,at least 9 or 10 mph,steady.But when the wind takes the kite and lifts it into the sky,it's an eyeball grabber!!The bright red trademark of the Baron,the very long tail,about 12 feet,it takes a while to carefully wind this up after flying(the tail)the Red Baron Kite.It's also abit time consuming to assemble and than dis-assemble the kite.But looking past this,it gets alot of attention,from the kids ""Oh,Moma,look at that plane kite.Can I have one?"" to the older folks who pull over,sit and watch,say ""Now that's a kite!"".I do enjoy this kite and would recommend it if you live in a place of moderate winds."
2,Great looking! Will not fly,"This is a fun kite that looks great, but it will not fly, no matter how strong a wind you find. Proof? Yes. I was that dad at the park with all the other dads on that windy day. The difference? All the other dads got their kites up. Just not me. So sad. Ha ha ha. Anyway, I can't vouch for my kite flying skills, but overall, if you want to spend time flying a kite, pick another."
4,Need some patience,"I agree you really need some patience to assemble the kite and it is kinda heavy to fly compared to other kites. I spent 15-30 to assemble the kite correctly because the beach was windy, made it harder to grab the kite. Because it is my first kite, i didn't know much about flying a kite, especially this kite is kinda heavy and tricky. it finally went up and it was a great experience. It needs medium to strong wind to fly it up, i will say at least 15 mph.It looks good and durable. what i don't like about it i have to assemble the kite. and it is trouble that i need to take it apart and put the pieces back into the bag when finish, hard to fold and be organized at the same time."
2,DO NOT BUY,This item is pathetically weak in high winds. If you are considering purchasing this product don't unless you are an extreme amateur or you just want a peice of junk. It is hard to fly and will not do you any good. It does look cool though.
4,renovation,"willard's work is unique from other treatments of spiritual formation in that it examines ""why"" more than it does ""how"". you will read this book and understand not only what God-honoring change needs to happen but what it is you are putting your spirit and mind and body through and how that will bolster the change you are attempting, by God's grace."
1,Am I the only one who disagrees with Dallas Willard?,"I have a really hard time swallowing any of this book. The first chapter seems to be an attempt to interject large and cumbersome words to have you submit to Willard's ""far superior mind"".Really! He spends the whole first chapter taking scripture out of context and rambling about what is sin and never actually saying it.I went to bible college. I took bible study. I took survey of old and new testament. I read and loved C.S. Lewis. But this book is horrible! And I'm shocked that I am the only one who thinks as much!"
5,Renovation of The Heart by Dallas Willard,"A really insightful writing. Willard will help everyone who reads this come to a better understanding of how God works in us to transform us into the image of His Son, Jesus Christ."
5,brilliant,"i've read many books and willard is flat out one of our best thinker's who mixes humility, insight, and practical know-how. he's heady as usual but much more readable than the divine conspiracy. the chapter on hell is probably the best explanation of lostness and hell that I've ever read. And his exposition on spiritual formation fills in the missing pieces from something like Foster's book on spiritual disciplines. it's less a how-to as it is a why and how."
5,"Not for the casual ""Christian"" or ""light"" reader, but life changing","Dallas Willard, yet again, brings more passion and wisdom to Christian discipleship than most authors ever do, with the exception of J.G. Marking and John Piper.Although this may seem weighty and heavy at first, the sheer depth of insight and the vast amount of wisdom and spiritual guidance within these pages is an amazing tool for anyone who actually wants to become more like Christ in a real way.Split up into four very concise and clear parts, Willard does a very successful job of revealing why, how and ironically when becoming more like Christ will renovate our hearts and transform our soul/lives.I've read no other book that so clearly displays the character of Christ and how to become more like Him on a daily basis."
3,Our hearts need fixing,"Willard delves into the psychological and spiritual reason that our lives don't work the way they stand on their own. Our hearts need fixing. We desire all the wrong things, think about the wrong things, and pursue the wrong things. This book is more scriptural-help than self-help, considering its premise that when we try to fix things on our own, we only screw things up.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"
3,Too academic for my taste,"I loved the Divine Conspiracy. I enjoyed The Spirit of the Disciplines. But this book I didn't really enjoy all that much. I can work with a philosophical style of writing as I sometimes slip into that mode too much myself. But this book seemed too academic and anticeptic to be of much help to me.Don't get me wrong, I am not arguing a point of theology just a point of style. I'm sure that others will find the book quite engaging but it just struck me as too cold. Maybe it is just me but as someone who has read many books this one just doesn't do it for me as much as some of Willard's other books have."
5,Great stuff,"This is great stuff to have just in case someone gets hurt. When my sister told me about Stomahesive I will admit I was skeptical. However, after using this product, to my surprise my wound healed faster. Endless to say, I will make sure this product is a permanent part of my medical chest. Once a gain Amazon.com came through for me!!"
3,Unnecessary ... But Shiny,"Yes,It's worth (...)but if you've played the old N64 version you'll remember what to do anyways.You'll be more than offended though that the swearing in the game is edited out!They swore more on the N64 version 5 years ago!?What's the G-O Xbox?I nearly threw great mighty poohs at the screen in disgust....oh yeh the book...It's fun, even if the game is an edited crap pile."
3,OK Guide for One Player,"This guide is nice only for the one player game. I originally bought this because I was looking for more indepth information about the multiplayer online version of this game, but it was sorely lacking in that area. It only gave the basic info and didn't even include stuff about powered up weapons or things that aren't listed in the instruction guide. Overall this guide was a definate waste of money since the one player game is about 5 years old and there was an old guide for that game already."
3,"A Great Saw, sort of.......","The worm drive saw is geared (no pun intended) to a very specific customer, the pro. I've used several different worm drives, including Black & Decker (now DeWalt), Skil, and of course Milwaukee. This model, while a very good model, has a few flaws. I've never used one that didn't leak a little around the spindle lock button. This is ok as long as you remember to check the oil level, but that doesn't happen often enough in the real world. The start-up torque is excessive, compared to other models. And the shoe does not run parallel to the blade, making it difficult to use an edge guide for straight rips. With proper care, it is a very good saw. The 15 amp motor gives you more than enough power to cut through almost anything. But I would not buy this one again, I'd go with the Skil HD77M."
3,smooth energy,"This amulet has a soft, smooth energy to it. Good if you wish to wear something on the ""lighter side"" of an power amulet. Love the King Solomon reference too."
3,Parables: The Greatest Stories Ever Told,"This study's author uses many ambiguous questions to get the point across. The material is good, but the questions are often irrelevant. I feel that a study should allow the reader/participant to come away with application from the study for everyday living and I think that the study fails to do this."
4,Parables,We are using this as a Sunday School study. We are just on the first of 12 lessons. Seems to be very good. This is the 6th of these studies we have done. All have been very interesting.
1,Do not buy,"I bought this for my mom at Christmas (2011). All of the ""gems"" (colored pieces) fell out in April so she does not wear it anymore. I tried to return it and it said I could not after Jan 2012. This was not worth the money - it fell apart! I would never buy this again."
2,"Nice locket, but only fits 4 stones, not 5.","I bought this for my Mother-in-Law. It's her only gift from me and my husband this Christmas. I received it today and was very pleased with the way it looked. I promptly went to put the 5 stones in, but no matter what I tried, they wouldn't fit. I then read the enclosed information, stating that this locket holds only 4 stones. The description on the site said 4-5. My Mother-in-Law has 5 kids. If the site had stated that this only holds 4 stones, I certainly would have gotten something else. I don't have the means to get her another gift before Christmas. Now I'm just going to have to take my chances and see if my Husband might be able to sand the stones down enough so that all 5 fit. Very frustrated and disappointed. Please fix the description. This would have gotten 5 stars if all 5 stones would have fit."
