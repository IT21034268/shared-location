1,Laaaaaaaaaame!,Seriously?? This movie was a true waste of money. Never again will I listen to my kids (or husband) when they give their take in which movies to rent. Thought the movie was a complete waste of time.
2,You couldn't pay me to watch this again...,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I almost went to the movies to watch it - so glad i didn't. I love vampire, zombie, sci-fi anything. I generally even enjoy a ""B"" horror/sci-fi flick. So as I write this I am trying to illustrate that I really wanted to LIKE it. I won't give any spoilers in the review, but will say that this movie was all over the place. Several scenes were just ridiculous. The train scene, horse scene specifically just left me starring into outer space wondering what the hell was going on. Abe at times didn't seem human to me, which he was suppose to be. One minute he was young, the next he was old. I was playing games on my iPad the last 30 minutes of the movie and my boyfriend was sound asleep. Rent or buy at your own risk, but if you do watch it I hope that you enjoy it more than I did. The fighting scenes were cool, but again was Abe really human?"
4,Great Storyline For This National Hero,I admire Abe and the depiction of his life as president was a nice twist.Recommend for anyone (PG). It's not scary and done in good taste.
5,Historical Fiction at it's best,Seeing honest Abe save the union from vampires seems plausible enough for me to enjoy this action packed romp. They made the vampires look scary enough (no sparkles!) and we get to see that awesome gun axe in action.
4,Interesting blend of fact and fiction,"This was a fun movie. An interesting take on ""what it"". It was very loose with some facts yet entertaining to watch without too much gore."
5,Loved this movie,"This movie was so much better than I expected! Even my wife, who was skeptical prior to watching it, thoroughly enjoyed it!"
4,Product Review,"Not bad, good tweener movie. This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!! AYFKM. Jusy Saying."
3,fun with Vamps,fun from start to finish good popcorn movie. Great for adventure for teens with testosterone poisoning and their girl friends to go eww at.
1,Too out there!,"This movie has good effects and if your into scify you'll probably like it, maybe love it! As for the rest of you...spend your money on another flick!"
4,Review,"The movie was better than we expected. Despite being a Vampire movie, it was actually quite humorous. Worth the rental."
4,Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter,"Not a bad movie ,it has better 3 D effects than a lot of the recent 3 D releases ."
2,ok,Visually stunning as far as special effects. The movie as a whole lacked intrigue and a storyline....somewhat disappointed with it.
3,Its an ok movie.,"I am glad I waited to watch this at home, but would have been very disappointed with it in the theater"
3,Surprisingly good,"I enjoyed the whole hilarious aspect of Lincoln being a vampire slayer, although at points the story did drag on quite a bit. The ending I thought was actually perfect."
5,Great Movie,"Not what I expected and was leary to rent, but got a big surprise with the outcome. It is a must see if you like vampire movies"
1,Save you $$ and time,"Do not rent, buy or watch this movie unless you like movies that waste your time and make you angry. Terrible special effects, plot line was predicable and ending makes you think the movie producers intentionally ended it the way they did just to make the viewers angry."
2,Eh,"If you read the book you'll definitely not like this. I know, another person who doesn't like the movie adaptation of a book but even on a strictly movie basis it was pretty bad. The movie had a basic introduction, just enough to get a person to understand the premise, but not enough for anyone to empathizes with any character.Basically, it was an action movie with just enough story to break up each fighting sequence to ensure that the entire movie wasn't one long battle. Some of the fight scenes were adequate, don't get me wrong, but there was a lot more that could have been done. The entire affair fell short of nearly any redeemable value."
3,Quite a few differences from the book,This film was more about action than about making the unique aspects of Lincoln's life seem like a cover for his exploits as a vampire hunter. The action is very good. Benjamin Walker is no Daniel Day Lewis but he is likable enough as Honest Abe. One cannot help but wonder what a film with this premise and the cast of the Spielberg film would look like.
1,Bars across screen on LG passive 3D TV,Won't comment much on the movie itself but the 3D didn't work. Had bars flashing across on my LG passive 3D TV with LG 3D blu-ray player. Had to switch over to regular 2D to watch this.
2,Please send the writer to an ayslum!,"What an idea! This is the most stupid (although entertaining) film I've seen these last years. And now what? George Washington a werewolf hunter, Bill Clinton a temporary female worker hunter?..."
2,vampire hunter,was not what i was expecting....just rather childish. I do know that there is a lot of blood sucker in the state of Ill. would not watch again
3,Strange movie!,They didn't follow the book very well. Did not explain what was really going on at all.. I was disappointed.
2,Just read the book and rent Blade,"Maybe I'm biased because I really enjoyed the book, but this movie is awful. The pacing was terrible, the characters were flat and the story lost quite a lot in the translation.Also, not really related to the movie but, come on Amazon no HD for the PC? Seriously? I know it's either some stupid licensing issue or more likely a ploy to get us to use Kindles, but I for one buy a ton of stuff from Amazon (book, movies, socks, everything) and I don't own a Kindle, nor do I have any plans to own one. So stop shoving it down my throat."
2,The Vampire Hunter,"The movie has a poor plot, and the acting is quite unexpected: all the cast could have a better performance."
2,Big Disappointment,"The trailer was the best part of the movie. It started out interesting, but the plot and story line got more and more ridiculous as the movie progressed. Kids might like it but don't recommend it for anyone over 15."
2,Meh,I expected more. There were definitely bright moments in this movie (the first part was pretty good) but it *seriously* lagged through the middle.
3,You Get What You Expect,"A few people will complain about this movie, but I would have to ask them what they expected. It's a ridiculous movie with a ridiculous premise. That having been said I enjoyed it. I wouldn't nominate it for an award or pay more than the rental price; but it was a fun movie to watch while nursing a hangover."
4,Very entertaining spin on history,Of course it's an absurd storyline but it was very well acted and the special effects were good. It was entertaining and enjoyable to watch!
3,"Hilarious premise, lots of action, good effects","I thought it was fun to envisage our greatest president as an action hero dispatching supernatural enemies within the context of the Civil War era. Between the (literally) break-neck action and the hilarity of watching ""Honest Abe"" wield his death-dealing axe, it's possible to have a rousing good time!"
5,Very cleverly conceived,"Not only was this a great Saturday afternoon movie with the family (we're all adults in mine, folks), it was a well-conceived story. This is, of course, is due to having great material from the book, but is also the mark of great filmmakers. This is worth your time and is well filmed and presented."
3,You'll probably like it.,"If the title intrigues you and you've gotten this far on your research, I'd say, go ahead and see it. You are probably a good fit. I was intrigued, but I guess my expectations weren't that high because I was suprised at how engaging it was. The Lincoln character is sympathetic carrying his burden much as the original may have done. Director Bekmambetov uses stop-action like a mogul. The mood and tone are borderline transylvanian. Nothing drags. It's all sewn together seamlessly with invisible thread. Bekmambetov knows how to fill the screen."
3,Not bad to rent....,The movie as a whole was good. The only thing I would say is there was too much leaning on CGI for some of the action scenes.
1,Terrible Plot,Uh this sucked. Bad movie with a bad plot. I would only recommend this if you are in to low budget movies.
1,Save Your Money!,"I saw most of this movie in the theater before my friends and I just had to walk out. Poorly written/acted action films should at least have the decency not to take themselves too seriously, along with a high enough production value to make the film visually entertaining. This film was on the very low end of all those categories. (Again, I saw this in the theater, where the visual effects are supposed to be the most stunning, and I felt like I was watching a D level made for TV movie on a big screen). The premise is supposed to be campy, but the director/writer/producer couldn't seem to agree on whether to commit to campy-ness or take the serious hero route. It was too annoying even to laugh at."
2,Read the book!,"The book was excellent; the movie was so far from the book that it isn't even worth comparing the two. The fact that the screenplay was written by the author of the book that the movie is ""based"" off of makes it even worse. If you read the book and are looking to see the movie because you liked the book, then don't watch it. If you haven't read the book and are looking for an action movie with a weird premise, then you may find it hard to keep up with the plot, but does that really matter in an action movie?"
3,Wow....much much better than expected,"We are now being overfeed with vampire and werevolves movies. Some good...lots bad.But this little movie, which is also about vampires...also brings you a formerPresident...Mr. Abraham Lincoln. I said it like that cause the actor does a verygood job in portraying him...and as a bonus we get to learn about the era ofslaves and freedoom and the cost of the battle of Gettysburg in which so many liveswere lost....so all of this is portrayed in this film with much more.Its a keeper."
3,Better than you might think,"Definitely one of those movies whose enjoyment is directly correlated with the expectations of the viewer going in. Given that I expected total garbage, I was pleasantly suprised to come away feeling like it was a good movie (for what it is). That being said, if it's a rainy day, there's nothing on tv, and you don't feeling like starting a good book - then this movie can provide some light entertainment to get you through an afternoon."
3,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,The movie was kind of far fetched to have a President be a vampire hunter. The chase on horse back with Lincoln trying to ax the vampire that killed his Mother was pretty intense. The actor that was Lincoln did an amazing vocal impression.
1,I was expecting more,"It was a little interesting to see history woven into a Vampire movie premise, but I would have like a lot more history, a lot more plot."
1,Not very good,"Very poor movie, found it to be a very poor storyline, acting was ok, but over all a waste of time."
1,Disappointed!,"I was intrigued with this movie. I had been considering reading the book for a while but I'm not a big fan of the civil war area. Hence why I went the movie route. It wasn't the time area that disappointed it was the disjointed acting and story line. Nothing really seemed to flow together. *SPOILER*...Really, he's 50 years old, hasn't fought vampires in 30 years and he gets on a train and kills them all...."
4,Great Action,"I enjoy a bit of history in a movie, even though not completely accurate. Action scenes were excellent!! Good movie on a 60"" Panasonic plasma. Tim Burton is the best!"
4,Surprisingly entertaining without being too over the top.,"I thought it was going to be absurd and just a movie focused on effects. It was not, it had a decent story line with legit characters to blend it all together."
4,Fun movie!,Fun movie with a pinch of historical flavor! I enjoyed the actor who played Abraham Lincoln. I thought he was well suited for the role.
4,Crazy fun,"This, of course, is silly, but it's clever and well thought-out. Just the idea of Abe swinging an axe at vampires . . . A lot of fun."
5,One of the best movies of 2012,"Great story, great acting - tons of action!!! It probably won't win an oscar this year but this film should be nominated for best picture!"
5,Good action movie!,"Enjoyable movie make more like this, good movies cant come fast enough.I was curious at first but felt it was a very good movie"
4,I like it.,"I have been wanting to see this movie for a while. It was not bad, thought it was good for a $3.99 rental."
5,Vampire Movie,A definitely different idea on vampire movies and Abraham Lincoln. I found myself watching the entire movie without wanting to fast forward through any parts. Personally I enjoyed it.
4,Better than expected,"Better than expected, strange concept but very entertaining. Very violent for younger viewers. But I wouldwatch it again. See it."
4,Not Expecting Much But Pleasantly Surprised!,"Sounds like a teen movie or something nonsensical. However, it was well produced and quite entertaining. I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit and was expecting almost nothing. You never know sometimes the title throws you off."
5,Good vampire movie.,The only thing I did not like was the overwhelming power of the vampires and their ability to walk in the daylight.
2,Not that good,Although the special effects are good this is only a middling horror movie. Interesting premise but don't expect any brilliant film making here.
3,Fun movie,Of course you have to totally suspend belief to get into it. It's a fun premise though and the movie quality was very good on my Kindle Fire HD
4,Cool Pres.!!!,"It was alright ,Not as good as I thought .But was fun to see Lincoln as a Vampire slayer! Should be a presidential requirement!"
2,slow,"not as entertaining as expected, very slow and not too much to keep you interested. not too good would not recommend"
1,Terrible,"I love watching flicks that are terrible, just for the mere fact that some memorable lines emerge. This is a terrible flick without a single redeeming quality."
4,Nothing fancy,"This is a total popcorn flick. It's pretty enjoyable, and I honestly wasn't expecting much from it. In that respect, it didn't disappoint.With something like this, you have to expect that everything about it is total fantasy. With that, again, it didn't disappoint.The movie could have been more, quite honestly.Why 4 stars instead of 3? Because it played on the factual relationship Mary Todd had with Stephen Douglas prior to Lincoln."
2,Way Too Many Slow Motion Scenes,"I hate when a movie has too many scenes in which the slow motion goes into play, it takes the moment away. This movie had a buttload of it. After like the 5th scene I was fed up with it. The movie was too short, the acting was stale sometimes and it was like a quick minute story moment then back to action and slow motion scenes. I felt I was watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. The actor does look similar to a young Liam Neeson but...the movie was lame. Overall I give it a 4.5/10 at best."
4,Not bad,I thought this would be a silly movie but it was actually pretty good. It was a fun movie to watch
1,Glad I only paid $1.99 to watch.....,"What seemed an interesting premise (having not read the book), turned into a farcical foray into dazzling cinematography..but mired with worthless drek.This was ""nuking the fridge"" bad.I'm all for suspension of disbelief in fantasy/horror films, but there are moments and sequences (Who knew so many people had Matrix-styled fighting skills in the 19th century?)that step into the realm of pure idiocy. This film made Timur Bekmambetov's previous film ""Wanted"" look like ""Lawrence Of Arabia"".....and that's saying A LOT!"
2,Book was better,"movie was bad, book was great. Too bad they didn't stick to the book, would have made a great movie."
2,a good horror film (if you're 14 years old),"This is a super slick, loud & flashy film that started with an interesting premise. Fortunately, the film succeeds for a certain demographic...about 13 to 18 years. For anyone with an appreciation of the horror genre or more complex plot lines, this one doesn't make the mark. Wait until it's on one of the movie channels. One thing: the director did an execllent job with a lame screenplay. I hope he gets another chance or two with better scripts."
3,Read the book instead.,"The movie was okay, but didn't follow the book very well. Took away from the effect and the story. The movie never fully developed any of the characters or wove the history in and out as well as the book. Good special effects in the movie. Overall, just read the book instead."
2,"Great Book, Poor Movie","Yes, I am reviewing this movie based on the fact that I read the book. I don't know if my opinion would have been different if I hadn't read the book, but my husband DIDN'T read it and didn't care for this film. (And both he and I are fans of this movie genre.)I was expecting more historical facts intermingled within the fiction. In the book, there are a lot more historical characters that Abe comes in contact with, who tie in to the whole ""vampire"" theme.I didn't feel there was enough character development at all. Again, referring to the book, I missed learning more about Abe's childhood and how that played a role in what he was to become. (a vampire hunter)As is sadly the case with most films made for 3D, it felt like the whole movie was shot to showcase the stunts/action scenes and NOT the story.I know films are never quite as good as the books, but they can be done SO much better than this."
4,Unique and entertaining!,"A young Abe Lincoln encounters evil as a boy, and it turns out they are vampires. He goes on a lifelong mission to hunt down the creatures who few realize live among us. He does this while being the President of the United States. This is a violent fantasy that has a bit if fun with the memory of perhaps our greatest president. He is trying to end slavery in this nation, but the vampires have been feeding off of slaves, so this threatens not only their existence, but the continued existence of our nation. You cannot take this one too seriously, yet it is not a campy parody. The serious tone and the ridiculous storyline mesh quite well together to bring us a film that is a welcome diversion. A premise so silly can be forgiven when a movie is this much bloody fun."
1,Shamefull,"It is ashame that the dumbing down of America has infiltrated toGollywood. Shame on the writers, producers and director. For using thename and image of one of our greatest leaders in such a grotesque way.This to the sane persons of this nation should be consider treson!"
3,Ho Hummm,"Not a very engaging movie. After about 10-20 minutes I was so uninterested that I started doing other tasks and the movie was mainly background noise. I would look up at certain times and watch for a moment but I then would lose interest, just not a tight script or engaging acting."
4,it should be better,the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad
4,Surprisingly Good,This film exploits the notion that Abraham Lincoln hunted vampires part time. As much fact as fiction but over all fun. I enjoyed this film way more than I expected to. I hope you get it and also enjoy it!
4,Good flick,"The movie was a nice change up on the vampire theme. Love all things Lincoln, and this did not disappoint."
4,no one said anything about sunlight or garlic!,"It was a really enjoyable movie: better in the beginning than the middle, I think. I would've loved to have seen it on the big screen."
4,Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"Alright! This movie has to be the surprise great movie of 2012! This film is definitely better in HD, also! It was delivered fast to my TV and in HD. I would recommend this to ALL my friends too!"
3,Decent movie,"Entertaining, I gave it 3 stars. Is it a great movie?, no but it is decent. I would suggest to be at least 12 to watch it."
4,Civil War Twist,This movie put a new unexpected twist on the Civil War. Lot's of edge of your seat action. Good movie.
4,Pretty Good,"It was pretty good. The vampires were portrayed in a different light, but still good overall. The acting was believable and filming was realistic."
2,50/50,Movie got off to a strong start...the young lincoln becoming a vampire slayer...second half intertwining his presidency with the vampires was week
2,A resounding 'meh'....,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but couldn't even get through the whole thing. The character development was terrible and a lot of the plot was really predictable and not in an ironic way. The only thing that's of note is the action scenes which were pretty great. For me though, even the action wasn't worth watching the whole movie and suffering through the characters and dialogue..."
3,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,It was just okay. I saw the previews for this movie and I was really excited to see it and when I did I was a little disappointed. Thought it was going to be much better and less...Korny.
1,Do Not Watch This in HD,Order this product in the non-HD form. The HD format was HORRIBLE and I do mean to yell that at you.The movie is fun to watch but the book is much better.
2,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter???,"Really preposterous film. Without computer generated graphics, like so many today, that make up for lack of acting and directing skills, this movie could never have been made. For those into ""vampire mania"", this movie with its abundant blood and gore, superhuman vampire strength, and ridiculous feats of 'daring do"" will be just the ticket. For those not into same, forget it."
2,Vampire Hunter,"I was disappointed when I watched this preview, which is what it is. You see I thought I would be watching the movie."
1,Worst Vampire movie EVER!!!,This is the stupidist vampire movie EVER made...and i've been watching them for 40 years...don't believe the hype cause this movie sucks...would have been better if they would have shot abraham lincoln in the back of the head when the movie started!
1,Awful,Stupid movie. Silly plot. Actually we rented it by mistake. Don't waste your time and money. It won't be difficult to find something better.
1,Honestly!!!!,"In the Seventies ""Saturday Night Live"" hypothesized what if Eleanor Roosevelt could fly. This five minute sketch was everything ""Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter isn't-smart, funny, and brief. The film's concept of our greatest President being a slayer of vampires par excellence is palatable for maybe a half hour. After that you're longing for a repeat of ""The Life and Times of Desmond Pfeiffer"". Where to begin. The story is tacky. The acting is wooden. The effects are pedestrian. The gore is a bore. I also found it offensive, even in a fantasy, the suggestion that Lincoln's mother Nancy and his son Willie were killed by vampires. I was also repulsed by the conceit that the Civil War was really a battle between the vampires and the mortals. Regardless, I can't imagine how this debacle was greenlighted other than the involvement of Tim Burton. Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" will be discussed for generations to come. This flick will always be the punchline to a bad joke."
4,Make a sequel Please!,"Very good movie.It's one of my top 10 easy, for si-fi horror.a different look at vampire history for the imagination.should get at lease 2 good sequels if they make them right."
4,Good Story,My husband didn't think it would be a good movie; then we watched it and enjoyed it. Good action and a good story line.
2,Not that good!,I didn't like this movie... It was kind of stupid to me... Maybe you will like it but I didn't... No real story to me.
4,Definitely Unexpected!,"I watched this on the advice of a friend who swore I'd like it, when I thought it would be a silly and low budget type movie. This is absolutely one of those few I was wrong about! The story was 'plausible' in an imaginary way, although there was a LOT to cram into a two hour movie. But the special effects were OVER THE TOP, making up for anything lacking somewhere else. Fresh idea done in a big way! Kudos!"
3,fun - but he's done better...,"Anyone who's had the pleasure of experiencing Timur Bekmambetov's brilliant Russian films, ""Nightwatch"" and ""Daywatch"" knows what he's capable of. As often happens, his Americanized filmmaking is less satisfying, with commercial concerns obsuring pure, rash inovation. Even so, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a good popcorn movie with some nice visuals. If you're looking for historical drama, look elsewhere. But, if laugh-out-loud absurd action pleases you, you'll enjoy this one, as I did."
3,"History, seriously?","I have read and heard many complaints this is not a historically accurate movie about Abraham Lincoln. Well, duh!! It is just an entertaining movie involving around one of our greatest presidents and the event that defined us as a nation, The Civil War. If you watch this movie with that belief I think you will find it entertaining. The only disappointment for me in the movie that it wasn't a cross over movie and didn't kill any of the Twilight characters."
2,The book is always better.,"If you're a big fan of the novel, do not watch. You'll hate how they adapted the novel into movie form and wish they had done it better."
1,ugh,this was so far fetched. i knew it would be going into it. i mean its abe lincoln and vamps. but some of the actions were just ugh!
3,Not realistic...,...hard to see Abe as a vampire hunter...not a good story plot.would have been more realistic in a different time period.
2,Abe Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"A shame. This could have been a good premise for a movie.It looked like a medium budget made-for-TV movie. Most TV episodes of ""Grimm"" were better made and written..."
2,"Boring and slow. Actions scenes are great, however very short.","Boring and slow. Actions scenes are great, however very short. Why am I forced to write 4 more words? I gave my review!"
3,"Nice blend of history and fantasy, but a weak story","I knew this movie couldn't be as bad as some of the one star reviews indicated, and it wasn't. The title says it all. This Lincoln's weapon of choice is an ax which he swings with skill and gritty determination, all to avenge the murder of his family when he was a boy. The film is heavy on action and special effects. Unfortunately, some of the effects wre mediocre at best, most notably during an insane horse chase and the climatic train ride to Gettysburg. It does do a nice job of weaving in actual events during Lincoln's life, both before his presidency and after, along with the fantastical vampire plot. This was not enough, however, to make up for a weak story driven by what is seemingly a sudden and confusing desire by the vampires for world domination. This is a decent enough film, but not one I would watch again."
4,"good fun, if you ignore the book.","Don't go into this movie thinking that it will be as good as the book, because it's not. It doesn't have the time to go into the depth that the book did.That said, it's still a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. (taking a horse-drawn carriage for a power slide? Sure!)"
4,Lincoln & Vampires,"I really like this movie that is why i just had to have it. Also i have very fast shipping, quick and simple. I was very surprised how quickly it arrived. This is a great movie in my opinion if you like vampires and all that jazz. Even my dad enjoyed the movie and he doesn't really like vampires, i would say that's something.."
4,Not BAD!,InThe scheme of things a very entertaining movie. Definately worth owning in your library. Great visual effects. Buy it you will be glad you did.
3,Interesting,"I was not as enamored with this movie as my wife and daughter. They enjoyed it, but I never really got into it. There are some superb reviews of the movie already on Amazon, but I'd rather have waited until this was on free TV"
2,skip it,i'll pay closer attention to reviews next time. i was intrigued by the title but it was as most of the reviews stated not worth watching. unless your into something you can make fun of.
1,"Issues with Blu-Ray DRM, couldn't play movie","I wanted to watch this on my lap top on a recent business trip, but the Blu-Ray Digital Restriction software on this disc seems to cause issues with the playback. I was able to watch another movie, so I know it wasn't the player. Later when trying it out at home, same issues. I've not been able to actually watch the movie yet. Normally I'd think it was a scratched disc or something but it won't even try to load the menu or allow me to see the scenes. I'll be trying to return the movie cause it's pretty useless."
1,Ridiculousness at it's finest,Only watch if you are completely bored and mindless and want more of the same. It gets credit for gorgeous scenery and eerie lighting.
1,What a sad departure from the book!!!,This was the worst abomination of a novel ever....the story line didn't even closely follow the book. The author must be horrified....I would not recomend this movie....
2,Entertainment,"Its ok for something different to watch on a Friday, but dont expect too much. I just could not see giving this movie more than two stars."
4,unexpected,"I fell asleep watching this, but what I saw was just what I like. there was violence and patriotism. I love the idea of this movie, but it didn't quite match up to what I thought it would be."
3,"Good fiction, but....","Yes, it is a well-done movie but it isn't pretty, visually speaking. Plot is weak at times and the visuals disappoint. If it were a more attractive film, I think I would have liked it better. I can excuse a disjointed piece of work if it is visually stimulating."
4,A Surprisingly Good Time,This movie was so much better than I expected. It had lots of action and the ridiculous premise was actually a lot of fun. The guy who plays Lincoln looks like he could be Liam Neeson's son!
3,a very good lincoln .,i personally felt this lincoln was a better fit than the lincoln from the self titled movie. it was a fairly interesting story but it seemed to drag on.
1,Crap,"Poorly written, improbable, impossibly strong Abe Lincoln that can jump on top of galloping horses while gets assassinated. Don't bother."
5,Entertaining,"I love the book, and I love the movie. The movie is a bit different from the book, I think it's a good thing. Why re-read the book if the movie tells the same exact story, only much quicker? They're both good in their own ways."
3,Honest Abe should have stuck to politics,"I would say that it didn't have interesting moments, but it was far fetched enough that it lost me a few times during the movie. What's next - George Washington: Zombie Hunter?"
1,Don't waste your money,Horrible movie. Worst movie rental decission I have ever made on Amazon Movies. Please don't waste your time or money.
2,its ok,I would not watch this again the story is very cheesy. Had a hard keeping up with the film just boring.
3,Falls Flat Compared to the Novel,"I realize that few movies are as good as the book and that movies can't be 100% like the book, but in this case, the movie just fell flat for me. I thought Twilight was a better movie representation of the book compare to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. The plot felt very discontinuous, as important events and people were absent. I was overall disappointed and was a little relieved when it ended. If its on TV one night, watch it. Don't spend any money on this.**Read the book, though. I give that 5 stars!"
2,"Not scary, not interesting, just very flashy","This film is not for those looking for scares or thrills. There are a few interesting bits but for the most part it's a limp story with a bunch of unknowns who lack screen presence. The vamps are buffoonish, clownish ogres who lack the syle and gravitas of Coppola's Dracula or Interview With The Vampire. And it is long, so very long, each minute felt like an hour. The movie drags, focusing too much on filling the screen with empty CGI and not enough on an engaging story. I hope this marks the end of the atrociously written mash up books.Skip this dud and rent Timur Bekmambemtov's Wanted, Night Watch or Day Watch if you are looking for great thrills."
3,OK,"I enjoyed the movie, but enjoyed the book more. The special effects were good, but character development was weak and less historical context than the book."
4,Decent period thriller,"Pretty decent storyline in this period thriller, a few surprising twists to the plot. Over all an enjoyable movie. Would recommend when you're just looking for some entertainment."
4,Vampire Hunter,This was a good movie overall. I can see them doing a sequel to this movie. I know they did one with zombies but I won't be watching that one.
4,Awesomeness,It was an great movie it even gave u a lil history lesson :-) the effects were cool and the story line was orginal...totally see abe lincoln in a new light
5,love it,great movie buy it and watch it in theaters so we get a sequel o watch again Ben Walker gives a great preformance
1,Save your coins.,"The ""best"" part of this film was the trailers which were free on TV. Way to long and never any noticeable attempt to draw in the viewer."
1,Piece of Crap!,"What an idiotic premise, which of course is why I had to watch it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! It is 2 hours of my life I will never get back (movie is not that long but I realized I was still sitting there with my mouth agape long after the movie was over and am not really sure how much time had passed!)."
2,Better book than movie.,"This was a hugely entertaining book that became a sadly lackluster film. Great cast, great premise and sadly it did not deliver!"
1,Terrible movie,"I had a hard time watching it. I really wanted to like it but it was over the top cheesy. The CGI was also poorly done and when they were moving around, it looked clunky. Wait until you can get it at home...for free"
4,"My review of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, which I rented one night and passed out during but then woke up around 5am and my","It was good.20 words. Alright, I saw this drunk. It's really good if your drunk. Or if you're, say, living in Colorado or Washington after the recent election."
3,A classic villian revisited:,"I am a Classic horror fan, and I had low expectations for this film. But this is a good movie, if not great. Acting was very nicely done with it set in real 1860s. Nice story with good special effects. Take a chance if you like this genre. You will not be disappointed I hope!"
2,You may be very disappointed if you read the book,"Abe Lincoln as a Vampire Hunter is certainly an imaginative idea. The movie's execution of the concept is far different from the book's:1. The movie is loosely focused on a plot and a super-vampire that does play a major role in the book.2. The movie's characters are loosely based upon the book. However some key characters are omitted, others are new, and some key characters are entirely different in terms of what they do in the movie vs. the book3. The surreal depiction and exploration of American History is 99% lost in the movie4. The definining events in Abe and Henry's lives are completely different from the book.Think of it in the following sense. Abe Lincoln was a legendary president...someone wrote a fantastic tale that he was also a vampire hunter...someone heard about the book (but didn't read it) and wrote a movie.I was not pleased and considered my time spent on the movie to be wasted."
4,Very entertaining,Don't know if it was because I wasn't expecting much to begin with but thourghly enjoyed this film. Give it a shot.
3,Not too bad but at the same time not so realistic or historical,"The movie had a decent thing going at the very beginning but as for the part of him evolving into a vampire AND a politician, it could be better. It felt like the movie was a little rushed and it left out tons of the history behind this great president. The movie SHOULD have focused majorly on just the vampire stuff and maybe have made more battle scenes and more on him becoming the vampire hunter. If the movie had ended with him in the end as president that would of been much better...The fact that he comes back as an old guy and the president (Who, even in that time would of been watched everywhere) to hunt vampires and save the country makes you question what the hell is this? If they kept him as young Abraham for the whole movie and in the end shows that was in his past BEFORE he was president, I would be giving this 5 stars.."
4,I thought George Washington was the president that used the ax? lol,This is historically a total fictional account of Abraham Lincolns life. However as a horror/action movie it was fun to watch.
4,Abe Lincoln Vamp Hunter,"I enjoyed this movie very much! It had some scares, cheers and fun all rolled into it!! I highly recommend this movie!!"
4,Clasificar,Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
2,Not what I was expecting.,I am not sure what I was expecting but this was not it. It was ok to watch it once and I was so excited about it I purchased it before seeing it..I won't make that mistake again.
3,vampire hunter,"Not bad seen better, not a big fan of the acting but liked the story line and humor...vampires were a little over the top..I'm a simple girl just need fangs no extenda mouth"
3,Book was better,So I read the book before I saw the movie and well. They are nothing alike. The only 3 things in the book that made the movie is that there are vampires that Abraham Lincoln fights and has help from his friend Henry and he became the 16th president. That is it. I liked the book better. If you read the book and liked it maybe try not to watch the movie. For me the only redeeming quality of this movie was that Dominic Cooper was in it as Henry and I like him as an actor. That is about it.
4,This is a dumb story,Ok it's just for fun. I enjoyed the pretext of the great emancipator going around chopping up vampires but I like vampire stories.
3,Fun when in the mood,"Good movie, but nothing to brag about. It's a fun spin with history involved. I bought it for those moods where you want to be entertained with action and a little bit of fantasy/fact involved."
1,Warning: So weird had to walk away,"Not sure how to rate this movie. It was just so, well, 'bad' overall that I had to leave. Weird or odd are better words yet they are not enough. The whole premise is very offensive to history but I'm cool with that if the movie is entertaining. This move is not entertaining. It's dance-fighting mixed with vampires, 2 genres tailored to women. I swear I'm tired of movies that only one sex can watch. Back in the day action movies were enjoyed by men and women now we get crap like this and women are just thrilled about it.By the way horrible all around, directing, plot, acting, fight scenes. I recall girl cousin bragging how there were 2 guys fighting literally on each other. Ick. Apparently vampires can make gravity go away, I don't know I'm not into Twilight and True Blood plus whatever else is out there. Just weird movie all together, when you watch it put your brain somewhere else for safe keeping to prevent damage."
1,"Vampire Hunter, NOT!","This film is B.S. Abraham Lincoln can hunt down and kill Vampires, but he couldn't use those skills to keep his head from being blown off by a human how approached him from behind. These film plots are getting DUMMER, what total B.S!!!!!!!!!"
2,Disjointed and bizarre,"A few good fight scenes loosely tied together by an intriguing, but never developed, plot and vast, unexplained passages of time."
2,disappointed,I really cannot say much except that the acting left a lot to be desired. I usually love Rufus Sewell and he wasnt in the movie enough to really carry it. the story concept was a good fantasy but I think if it was written a little differently it may have flowed better.
2,yawn,Interesting little story. Basically a Kung-Fu president vs evil vampires. I think I prefer Daniel Day Lewis version of the story...
1,What? Did they even read the book?,What happen to the plot? In the book it was fun and had some historical fact. This was so bad I didn't finish it.
2,Worst vampire movie ever.,Wait until its on tv. Even then I would keep the laptop ready to entertain yourself online. Should have used a different president.
2,Boring. Not really a thrill for a vampire genre person.,"So boring. A young man, Lincoln, swings his axe to kill selected vampires. Really really lame. I like a good vampire flick, but this, well, does not qualify. Buy it in the bargain bin."
4,Unexpectedly Good,Tim Burton Delivers again. Definitely well made and thought out. May be that's exactly how it played out ;-) Worth seeing.
4,Pretty Good,I thought that this was a pretty good movie. Pretty entertaining and i liked the whole concept. The actor who plays lincoln does a great job.
4,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter [HD],My wife and I had lots of fun with this movie. Liked the actors and the characters they portrayed. Fun movie night.
2,Rent time needs to be increased,"24 hours is sometimes not enough to watch a movie, especially for us with lives busy enough that we shop online on sites like Amazon! I missed the last 10 minutes of this movie because my rent time expired! :-(The movie itself was great!"
3,The book was much better--but that is usually the case,"If I hadn't read the book, I'm not sure that I would have followed this movie. Okay though, I guess."
4,Not historically accurate,"Definately a different look at Lincoln and History. If you like all things vampires, this one is for you. While based on the book, obviously, to fit on a screen there are some differences and abridgements."
3,Savage Vampire Movie,Dominic Cooper looks great with his shirt off for all of 1 minute - the bulk of the movie is killing vampires and revenge for a mother taken. It had some very great moments and a lot of gratuitous violence.
3,original but forgettable,this is basically a vampire movie with a twist. the book is much much better. the acting is OK. music is OK.
3,Not too bad...,"Very entertaining movie, but my husband and I got tired of the CGI. I wouldn't pay to see it again, tho I'm sure my son will want to watch it soon enuf"
3,OK - I've seen worse,"Kind of an interesting twist. Pretty badly edited though - ie. bruises and cut on lincoln's face in one scense, next scene no cust or bruises, and then a following scene with cuts and bruises. All in all, however, I have paid for worse."
2,A whole lot of aweful,"I walked into this movie with moderate expectations but after watching it was very dissapointed. Its overly CG'd and poorly done. Want my advice, stay away from this one."
2,"THE BOOK, you guys","Having read the book, I was hoping this would be a lot better. Seth Grahame-Smith's book incorporates a lot of real-life historical detail that not only adds depth to the story but really gives special meaning to all the vampire stuff. It's surprising that Grahame-Smith signed off on this movie, much less that he was responsible for the screenplay, because the story is hollowed out into a stylized action/horror movie that's pretty much what the title indicates, but nowhere near its potential, leaving it maybe a notch better than Sharktopus territory. Also, Benjamin Walker was really not good.I guess if you just want to see Abe Lincoln fight vampires, go for it, but if you know better or want more, just stick to the book."
2,Book was better,"The things that made the book work, meshing real-life historical events with vampire fiction, is mostly ignored in the movie. Especially the last 2/3 of it. If you read the book and liked it, save your money."
1,Worst movie ever,"Only watch this movie if you are completely hammered. And even then it may not be worth the $5, so pick up a bag of shrooms to make this watchable."
3,This was pretty?,This was pretty good. I just like the idea Abraham vs. Vampires.It has a Matrix feel to it.I liked it.
3,Least they don't sparkle.,"This movie is pretty fast paced, if you blink for too long, you can miss quite a lot. I am part of the MTV generation, so faster pace does keep me more interesting in a film, but this one I felt could have been slowed down a little bit. Not just that, but you go from Abe's childhood, to a young man to him being president very quickly, and it feels like something has been missed out on in-between... maybe someday a director cut will come out that gives the pace of the film a reasonable flow, but I felt this one just goes a bit too fast. The beginning and middle I didn't enjoy that much, but the final action scenes where done nice enough to keep me away from twiddling my thumbs and just enjoy the excitement.I don't have to explain the plot to you do I? I'm sure you know who its about and what he does.Overall, I'd say rent it before making any decision to purchase your own copy. For me, it's not one I would watch again for a while, but it was good for one nights entertainment."
2,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"The essential idea behind this film is twisted enough that it should have been very good. Unfortunately, the execution of the idea was lacking in many, many ways. Its essentially a flood of over-the-top computer generated combat that left me yawning and only the most labored attempt at any character building. The story itself was practially non-existient. There also weren't any key moments that left you thinking that plowing through the visuals was worth anything. For the most part, its a 2-hour video game trailer, without any real purpose or meaning. I was left feeling empty because the concept had lots of potential and it could have been so much better."
2,this movie could of worked..........,The movie had tons of potential but it just seem like they could not get it to mesh right which would be hard I suppose for goodness sake its abe. So while the action is there and the actors did a great job. The story just was not strongly written to even make it a C- movie. But like I said it had potential...............
3,Strange,Not what I expected from he title but better than I thought it would be. Writer has a great marination
2,awesome potential.............but no.,I rented with great expectation. Vampires? Axe wielding presidents? What could go wrong? Me.Horrible movie making waste of perfectly good original idea.
3,Entertaining but not great,"Lots of action, well-acted, and entertaining, but I can't quite get past the use of Abraham Lincoln in this type of story."
3,Fun alternative fictional history!,"Look, it's not a blockbuster or a great movie... But if you're into this sort of fictional/alternative history (i.e. Fatherland, It Happened Here, etc. Granted those two are more plausible ""what-if"" scenarios), this was a fun movie. Good special effects, decent acting, just simply fun to watch. Don't go into it prepared to be blown away or walking away a better person for having seen it. Take it for what is. If I could've done 3-1/2 instead of 3 stars, I would have. Best way I'd describe it: It was fun to watch & I enjoyed it. But I won't be buying it. I have NOT read the book, but I've heard it is MUCH better & i know some things from the book are left out."
4,Standard Definition Streaming Rental,"Get past that first scene where dialogue is ripped from '70s made-for-tv slavery movies and you get a very entertaining action movie. This is a movie where acting redeems the dialogue.John Murdock is given a few scenes, but it's the supporting cast that makes this movie.Oh, and that's not Booger (Curtis Armstrong); it's Dominic Cooper."
3,Somewhat entertaining,"Somewhat entertaining, but the action sequences tend to be repetitive. It was not very climactic and a bit of a let-down."
2,very confusing and too busy,"They tried to hard to tie in the vampires with the historical facts. The result was a very confusing, hurried plot that in some cases made no sense. I was not overly impressed."
4,Good performance but!,Some ghosting. Pricing was comparable to others streaming services but seems like VUDU streaming has the best HD.. I think most services use 720p for HD streaming. What I would like to know is what's the min connections speed for full 1080p streaming..My min connection is ~3 mbs up to 10mbs
5,Great Movie,It was an awesome movie. It kept my attention. It was very interesting. Great mixture of fiction and historical facts.
4,I like it,"good acting, good special effects. Original story. Only gave it a 4 because it seemed to be lacking something, like maybe a directors cut."
2,Mark in Memphis,"This one tried to bite off more than it could chew. Some clever points tied to historical events but overall it was just dumb. Special effects were weak at times and the story was way over cooked. It's a comic book, graphic novel deal that missed its audience."
3,entertaining,"It was not a spectacular film, but I do not think anyone expected it to be. It was definitely entertaining."
4,Interesting story concept,The story line is great... I took a star away only because of the gore factor. A bit too much for my taste.
4,Interesting,"Interesting take. I read the book first, and though I wish there were some more accurate pieces from the book in the movie, I think they still do a pretty good job. It was action packed, and kept you riveted throughout the film. I feel that all the actors did a great job."
3,Read the bok,"Not what I was expecting, as usual this movie doesn't live up to the high standards set by the book."
3,abraham lincoln vampire hunter,interesting concept the book was better but it was still well done for such an out of the ordanary idea
1,It wasn't my choice of movie!,Combining a great man in our history with vampires just shows to what limits of stupidity we will go to be entertained.
2,I probably wouldnt recommend watching this movie,"Well the movie itself was hilarious because of how bad the plot and graphics were. Even though it wasn't really supposed to be funny but it was still good for a laugh. I absolutely love the Amazon customer service though. The playback when I was watching it was really bad where I pretty much couldn't see some of what was going on when anything fast happened. I'm pretty layed back though and I only payed about $4 to rent it, so I didn't really even think about complaining. However I guess that someone at Amazon was monitoring how it was playing and the next day I received an email apologizing for the quality and saying that they were refunding my money."
2,Not worth your time...,"Unfortunately this is a terrible film. The production values are certainly at ""B"" movie levels and the acting led to little comfort too. This film is not worthy of your time commitment."
2,Just no.,"I'm probably the wrong person to review this. It was my husband's pick for a Thanksgiving movie. I should have given in to food coma and not bothered myself with this movie. I like action movies and martial arts but I'm not a vampire movie kinda gal. I do like cheesy movies and have always appreciated Abe Lincoln. On the other hand, I hate being scared and I especially hate effects that are absolutely impossible. Was this supposed to be like the ""true"" telling of a legend or an excuse to kill vampires? I also really hate it when someone has the super human power to hold a train tressel together while a train is going over it but gets injured in a fight. Let's be consistent here. Whatever. I'm not waiting any more time on this. If you feel like wasting a couple hours of your life, if you will have no peace until you see vampires die on your television at the hands of an American president, then watch this movie."
2,This was truly an awful movie... where as the book was truly great!,"We both could not be more disappointed with this movie. Artistic liberty... was taken all over the place.The book was great and i would recomment it to anyone for the book actually made this entire scenario seem plausible. The movie on the other hand...???? Thank goodness we did not waste our money in the movie theatres. Rending on DVD... sure, why not... but if you are picky.. wait for the ""made for tv"" for you are not missing much.Go read the book, it's great! The movie... not so much.Sorry.T"
2,"Even if it were free, it wouldn't be worth your time to watch","I really wish that I could unwatch this movie. I expected it to be ridiculous, but in a good, entertaining way...was neither good or entertaining. I almost stopped watching it halfway through. I wish I had, but I was determined to see it through."
2,What tripe!,"Why don't we take 90% of vampire mythology and chuck it because it doesn't work with our shooting schedule? Then we can pick a beloved historical figure and make them look ridiculous and self serving. Last let's blame the proliferation of slavery on vampires needing a food supply and not on the plantation owners who didn't want to have to pay for labor. How anyone could write such garbage is beyond me. Being a vampire fan I certainly hope most studios will steer clear of the ""historical"" monster movies in the future."
2,Terrible,The movie was difficult to watch and the storyline was absurd. Abraham Lincoln who had no special powers just simply trained to develop strength to ward off and track down vampires. That was no plausible in defending against a vampire.
1,terrible.,this movie was so disappointing. the book was amazing but this movie was the biggest load of crap to be put on the big screen. it made my brain cry.
1,"Boring, wooden, lifeless.","I would have walked out of the theater if I had been in one. My worst DVD purchase ever. Loved ""Wanted"" but I think this director peaked there. Amazing to see so many wonderful actors insuch a numbing, souless, bland, mess."
1,No. Just no.,"I loved this book. I'm not really crazy about vampires, but I loved this book. I went into the movie aware that the books are always better than the movies and fully expecting it. I still expected SOMETHING from the book to make it into the movie though. Everything that I loved about it somehow did not make it into the movie. Instead, it was all replaced by flashy action sequences. I debated giving this 2 stars just because some of the action scenes were pretty cool. But my husband who had not read the book said they made no sense whatsoever, so I couldn't do it. Don't buy this movie."
3,Overall wasn't horrible,"This movie wasn't quite what I expected, but it wasn't bad. I kind of expected a little more (not really sure what), but I do like how they tied the war into it and gave a different random take on the whole thing."
3,Good but not great,I really wanted to love this movie but by the end I just thought it was okay. The acting was pretty flat. The plot was just not imaginative or very interesting. The fx were great but not enough to carry the movie.
3,OK,"This movie came with more hype than it deserved.If you have nothing else to do, watch this.If you like cheesy horror/vampire movies you can watch this.Just don't let other people see you watch this or recommend it. They will think you have no taste in movies"
1,so bad,I can't even begin to describe how painful this movie was. Spare yourself a lot of pain and watch something that isn't popular ONLY BECAUSE its the flavor of the week. In the spirit of Twilight or Hunger Games this movie takes a great book and makes it suck. And I mean REALLY suck.
3,Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter,It's funny especially with Abe Lincoln swinging his ax as he fights off the vampires located near New Orleans. Tim Burton does a fantastic job with the graphics.
3,"Finally, the true story has been told.","Or, I think we're gonna need a bigger ax.Fast paced and entertaining. Doesn't take itself seriously. Worth the $1.20 Redbox price."
3,Surprise!!!,You have to let your imagination run wild with this one. Abraham Lincoln is killing vampires!!! It's a little weird because of the name of the main character and manner in which he kills vampires.
4,Interesting,It was a well made movie with an interesting slant on history. Definitely worth watching. I liked they way they used the story line to illistrate historical events.
4,it was not bad,acting was better than a lot of movies i have seen recently. story was good. i felt involved in the story and its got lincoln killing vampires. what more can u want from a movie
3,Movie had good parts,The movie was a little slow and could have used more action. I kept wanting more but it never seemed to get there.
3,"Good acting, Bad story",Why in the world would Tim B. put vamp in a movie about Abe? This director needs a long vacation. Maybe he will get his act together
3,Honest Ab!,"Surprisingly good. I had low expections for the movie. Ab Lincoln as a vampire hunter, really? But the plot keep me interested and the graphics were pretty good. Overall good movie I'd likely give it 3.5 if I could."
3,abraham lincoln:vampire hunter,"Not bad, but it was a little bit out there. Would have enjoyed it more, but I don't like vampire movies to much.Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"
2,The book was great!,The book was great! The movie did not express the same excitement as the book did and it strayed from the book. The movie was pretty far flung at the end with the legions of vampires fighting union soldiers and the silver bullets being hauled in the train.
1,Rotten,this movie was the pits I know it was surpposed to be campy but it was flat and boring. I would avoid this one
1,total crap,"Take everything you know about Abraham Lincoln and discard all of it, surround him with 21st century douchebags, add in some painfully cliche vampire tropes, and that's the basic premise. There was so much potential here. If it would have actually been Abraham Lincoln as a vampire hunter it would have been awesome. but it's not. it's not abraham lincoln. it's just some dude. I can't even waste any more energy giving this a proper review, it's jut not worth it."
2,disappointing and cheap,This feels very TV movie from top to bottom. Boring plot that has gaping holes and tries to fill them with boring ideas and 1 semi good twist. Huge time fuege where for 10 years nothing ahppens and overall quite boring is all I have to say. I expected it too thats how bad hollwood is. Put on your white guilt boots but turn off your brain.
3,Ax murderers,"Call me crazy or undiscriminating, but this book was so much fun! I enjoyed the storyline, the hero's mentor, and it's such an over the top premise that it actually works. Biggest problem: Abe's weapon of choice is an axe. Vampires are supernaturally fast and axes are not. No matter how hard Lincoln practices, it's not credible that he wages war with vamps using an axe. Swords were available then, as well as bows and arrows, stakes, fire, and pistols with special bullets. I loved the ending, and didn't see it coming, though I should have. The unfortunate movie went straight to DVD, and everyone pronounced it an instant bomb. Not unexected. No matter, the novel was a glorious romp through decapitated vampire heads, and Lincoln's obsessive hunt for these repulsive vampires was entertaining to follow."
2,"Meh, I heard the book was much better",My husband read the book and really wanted to see this. Glad we got it during Amazon's weekend sale because it wasn't that great. They tried to make every action scene look like the Matrix and the story was just so-so. Wouldn't recommend this.
2,The book is awesome,"When I was watching this movie, I felt like some one picked up the book, read the back, and thought, ""Hey, this would make a great movie."" They then summarized the back of the book for someone else, who wrote the screenplay based on that. The book was AMAZING, especially in how the author combined historical and fantasy. Abe Lincoln worked hard to get strong enough to fight vampires. There was none of this super-hero chopping trees with one swipe cause of his feeling crap. Read the book, skip the movie."
3,The effects are pretty good,"The effects are good but just watching Abe as a vampire hunter is hard to believe and detracts from the movie. I know, it's just a movie...but maybe a character other than Abe might have fit better."
3,Vampire Hunter,"A different story that I expected. Interesting but not really engaging to the viewer. Not really impressed with the plot, but it wasn't a total waste of time."
3,Vampire,This was a real disappointment and I watch it and was not really impressed.I will trade tis one in for a movie that I really want
3,Better than I thought,"Better than I thought. I rented it because I thought it would be totally stupid, but was surprised it actually was pretty good."
2,Dissapointment,I thought this movie could have been way better than what it is. It is boring and predictable. I was not impressed.
3,so-so,"A little too much gore for my taste but all-in-all a decent story line and entertaining. Not sutable for children under 13 by any means, not for foul language but for the ick factor."
3,So so,"I found it hard to pay attention to this movie. Although there were some entertaining parts, I thought the movie dragged."
4,"Good action, unnecessary nudity.","I thought the action scenes were pretty awesome, but the movie would've been a little bit more enjoyable without the nudity. I'll never understand why people think things can't be entertaining without it."
2,Got Sucked,"Well since I fell asleep not once but twice watching it... But worse, I thought with Amazon I had 24 or 48 hours to watch it but when I re-loaded it to see the ending when I woke up, Amazon charged me a second time. Maybe I didn't miss much but Amazon lost a good customer."
4,very good!,Just saw Lincoln-excellent and decided to watch this. I love the way they wove the vampires into Lincoln's life and the Civil War.
4,Good movie,I was just buying this movie for the 3-D. But this movie turned out to be better than I expected. The 3-D is really good places. I would suggest this movie.
2,I love it. this is so awsome,"I liked everything about it and I recommend it to anyone over 12yrs ,Full of surprises and action you will love it"
4,Great!!,Very good movie keep me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. I would see it over and over again..
3,Not Bad,I had read the reviews and thought this was not going to be good. However I love vampire movies and with Abe Lincoln how could I resist. I was in the mood for a good popcorn movie and this filled the bill. It was not a great movie by any means and you need to suspend reality quite a bit. But this movie was not as bad as I had been lead to believe. The action was awesome and I like the way the film looked. All in all had a very good time for an hour and a half. Maybe in the summer or Halloween I will watch it again.
3,A different take on Abraham Lincoln,"While it will not win an Oscar, it was entertaining to watch as a vampire movie. What I really liked was the way this movie incorporated historical facts into this movie. I seriously hope that no one thinks that this movie is entirely based on facts. Overall I would say not a bad movie if you are looking for just someting to watch."
4,"Great, fun movie","I admit I was pleasantly surprised at the acting, story line and production. While it was all about killing vampires; the ""killing"" was done in a surreal, removed fashion that wasn't disgusting. Glad I picked it up!"
4,Good movie,"I thought it was very interesting, Henry is hot and he's a vampire. I would deff. recommend watching. I would be cool if this was real"
3,Good Special Effects,"I was curious to see what this movie was about (as if you couldn't tell by the title!). The special effects are great and it does keep your interest throughout, but I think it is not really a great movie only a good one. And, you have to admire the director and producer for having the courage to make it in the first place."
1,Horrible - nothing like the book.,"Not sure why they even bothered. Most movies aren't like the books, but this was a disaster and a waste of money. Thankfully I had only rented it!"
1,Don't waste you time or money!,"Once again, Hollywood has taken a wonderful story and ruined it.Mere words do not exist for me to explain how I feel about this movie.If i was the author, I would sue to have my name removed..For that matter,If I had been part of the crew, i would ask that my name be removed."
3,dull,i love the quick download and convenance of this service...i just didn't like the movie...it was just unremarkable...but i thought it was well acted
3,"Nice idea, but a goofy premise.","It's was ok a time waster, but the whole idea of honest Abe as a vampire hunter is a goofy idea. George Bush maybe with Saddam as the King of the Vampires might have worked better."
3,Matrix meets bad history,"The title should have shied me away. But, in the end it was fairly entertaining. Plenty of action. Good guys win. Bad guys lose. Good movie to watch when drinking with your buddies."
4,A history of Lincoln you can sink your teeth into!,"Great special effects, good alternate history, interesting twisty plot; I liked this movie so much I watched it twice during my 24 hour rental. It's not your usual take on vampires, particularly their ability to adapt to daylight. Despite some departures from traditional vampire lore it was well acted, and pretty well written; there were only a couple of awkward places that I noticed (like the dance scene with Abe and Mary). The actor playing Lincoln is cute in his own plain way, the one playing Henry is hot, Mary Todd is pretty, and Rufus Sewell adds experience and name recognition (and his own good looks which have held up well since Dark City). Honestly I'd rent this just for the horse stampede and the firey trestle scene sequences! If you're up for a romp in an alternate past where the action is fun and crazy and full of surprises, give honest Abe a chance. Just remember to emancipate yourself from your disbelief for a while."
4,Good fun thrill ride,"A bit of suspension of disbelief is required, but this movie is a fun ride! Worth renting and I would watch it again."
4,"Scariest vampires ever, great show",The vampires in this show were amazingly strong and scary as hell. The plot was exciting and had some very good twists.
2,"Probably OK if you're into vampires. Otherwise, mostly not.","As yet another vampire-sploitation flick, it's probably decent, if that's what you're into. The production values are high. As a film related to Lincoln & his times, it does make a few interesting parallels, but in total they last about 5 minutes. It's anti-slavery flavoring is nice, if minimal, but the rest of the film is ludicrous (Lincoln practicing Kung-Fu-like moves with his axe) in both plot and action, and, of course, violent and gory. The guy who plays Lincoln must have had too much botox before the shoot, as his expression never changes. 2 stars is generous."
2,Pass on this movie,"Not a very good movie. There is really not much more to say. Very poor script but good actors. Pinning this movie on Abe, come on !"
3,THis movie was a disappointment,The movie was cheesey and disappointing. I read the book which I LOVED! I am glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater.
1,slow mo OVERKILL,"At first, i found the intro interesting. Then...then it got ridiculous. The slow motion used in several parts throughout ruined the flow of the film for me. Very exaggerated and overdone, in my opinion. As usual, the book was better!"
3,Fun Movie; Lots of blood and gore.,"Dark story, lots Blood and gore. Best documentry of the year. . . . . . . . . ."
3,Okay is as far as I could go.,Pretty repetitive and and was the type of movie to put me asleep fast it moved along just fast enough to prevent that however.
2,Routine,"Except for the interesting premise of the story, casting the former president as Buffy, the movie is extremely humdrum. Story is entirely predictable, the action scenes mildly exciting."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Good premise, but the cast couldn't pull it off. Wait for this to come to a subscription streaming service like Netflix or Amazon Prime."
4,Better than I expected,No comment More comments ... .. . ............... .............. .......... . . . . . .... . . . .
2,"Neat Concept, But Poorly Executed","I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't. The premise was interesting, but that's about where it ended. Don't waste your time or money on this dud."
4,pretty good,I absolutely loved this book so I was really excited to see this movie. I wish it had stuck closer to the book and I'm not sure about the ninja like quality of the fight scenes but it was still pretty awesome due to the concept of the story alone.
3,Less than I expected.,"Not very good acting. I guess I should have expected that. 3D was nice, some scenes were excellent. Therefore I gave it three stars."
4,Its okay,A liitle too unbelievable so it somewhat lost my interest toward the middle of the movie. But my children liked the movie very much.
4,Good for what it was supposed to be,"For what it was intended to be, it wasn't half bad. Of course, this is a genre movie, and it is not without its flaws, but it was entertaining and unique. With all the same-old-(spit) movies out there, this movie deserves a watch if for nothing more than to see something unique and not some half-(hashed) remake of a movie that wasn't good to begin with."
2,"Entertaining, mostly....","It was predictable, but the fire and explosions kept drawing my attention away from my laptop. Glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it."
3,Not what I was expecting,Had a hard time staying with the film. Great chance to view with Prime though and that was worth the effort.
1,Don't waste your time.,A novel and interesting idea with a very poor execution. Mainly a gore fest with no substance and no attempt to actually fit the story into the times it tells of.
1,Did not finish,"Too awful to watch. I'm wondering if I can get my money back for it, or for the remainder beyond the 30 minutes watched. I watched all of Transformers Dark of the Moon and could not finish this."
5,LOVED THIS FLICK!!!,"It is hard to describe how much I love this film. It was funny and kind of touching at times. Lincoln never seemed so cool. The way history was interwoven with fiction was really impressive and visually it was extremely engaging.I rented it once, but knew immediately it was worth buying.If I knew how much I would love it I would have bought it straight out."
4,Fresh,"Fresh, new effects. Loved the horse scene. Nice not to have a lot of nudity, like I'm most vampire movies."
1,Awful...,This movie was terrible. It is nothing like the book at all. There is a good reason it bombed. I can't believe I spent $2.99 renting it.
1,Awful,Took me 3 sittings to get through. Didn't enjoy it as much as i expected. Expected more from Daniel Day Lewis. Not his best work.
1,Terrible,"Never stops to acknowledge the high farce it could have been. Instead it feels like it is taking itself far too seriously and quickly descends into the drek of overused vampire tropes, offering nothing original or even vaguely entertaining."
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"... and I've seen some bad ones. As a person that has no problem with suspension of disbelief if there is ANY redeeming quality, I can only say that this was an unbelievably bad movie. Bad story and worse execution topped off by cheesy CGI."
1,Not Worth The Price,Glad I Only Paid 3.99! I Guess I'm Just Not into Stupid Vampire Movies. Glad I Didn't Waste My Money And Time Going To A Theater.
2,decent action but not very interesting plot,"I love action movies and this one had pretty good action but the plot was pretty bad. I actually found it kind of boring, Unless you have nothing else to watch, I do not recommend it."
2,JUST NOT UP TO PAR,IF YOU READ THE BOOK THEN YOU WILL BE VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE. THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT READ AN A+ THE MOVIE JUST DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE BOOK.
1,Worst movie,This movie was not worth even the rental price. I knew that the subject matter was a bit far out to begin with but I expected more from a Tim Burton film.
3,formula based on formula,Hollywood has just run out of original ideas. Abe lincoln was a great man who i believe this film makes a mockery of.
2,Almost entertaining,"Ok, the book wasn't Shackspeer, but it was fun, enjoyable. This could have been either of those, but was just a waste of two hours."
1,An author's view of Catholicism...not necessarily Merton's,Paul Hourihan's novelization of Thomas Merton's last day reads more like an apologia for his own loss of faith in things Catholic rather than an imaginative exploration of Merton's death in Asia. This self-published novel reveals far more about the author than it does its subject. For a real understanding of the issues Thomas Merton wrestled with read the journals he maintained during the course of his adult life.
4,Excellent insider look at the Cuban missle crisis,"Of course Robert Kennedy was right in the thick of the Cuban missle crisis along with his brother the President. So he was able to give a unique perspective about what really went on behind closed doors.I found the book compelling. Kennedy wrote it in a superb matter-of-fact style which underscored the gravity of the situation. There are no histrionics here, or finger pointing. Everything is concise and to the point. It's a short book so it's a quick read but very interesting nonetheless. I recommend it."
3,The Kennedy's as saviors....,"RFK's biased account of the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis is so completely one sided that one can hardly not think of it as a work of fiction. He and his brother are presented as saviors, destined to call themselves the heroes of the conflict, as everyone else in EXCOM and working on the conflict were nearly obsolete. RFK offers incessant praise to himself and his brother, and fails to dwell on the fact that Khrushchev and Adlai Stevenson had much to do with the outcome of the crisis. It was Adlai Stevenson who first presented the idea of a missile swap for the Jupiters in Turkey, and it was Khrushchev who made the first move at negotiations. Not to discredit the Kennedy's or the members of EXCOM for their relentless deliberations, but in order for this work to be considered seriously as a reference source, one must first learn of the actual happenings of the crisis, then sift through the Kennedy idealism and praise of themselves."
2,More Detail Please,"Maybe I missed something in my copy of this book, but I was disappointed in the level of detail. I was expecting a blow by blow account Bob Woodward style and I got what I viewed as almost a campaign ""get to know the candidate"" piece. I wanted more details about how the other people involved in the issue were acting and thinking. I also wanted more detail on JFK and the overall military activity. I come away from this book still looking for more information."
2,"Some insight, some disappointment","I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed. I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative). A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents. I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days. The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author. There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative. For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile. This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more."
1,Let's include the truth in the revised edition,"If you want some truthful insight into the Betrayal at the Bay of Pigs which Kennedy totally mishandled thus leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis then read Grayston L. Lynch's book ""Decision for Disaster: betrayal at the bay of pigs: A CIA Participant Challenges the Historical Record."" My father personally lived through these very difficult times and can tell you the other side of the story that US history books neglect to even tough upon. Lynch's book can be obtained through Brassey's, 22841 Quicksilver Drive, Dulles, VA 20166Enjoy reading a very compelling factual book that the Kennedy Adminstration never wanted anyone to know about."
2,"Great book, no new secrets but a lot of personal insight.","This was how the Attorney General, who was the Presidents closest advisor, saw the crisis unfold, and what he encouraged JFK to do. Good book, but somehow missed that it was a pocketbook, when I wanted a hardback edition."
4,"first-hand-account, fast-paced, fascinating","Read up on one of the most terrifying moments in history, the near destruction of the world by nuclear holocaust. This quick read takes you inside the White House where policy makers decided how best to react to the Soviet Union's establishing a nuclear missile base on the island of Cuba. This is a first-hand-account, fast-paced, fascinating page-turner of a history book."
4,Very good book,"It's a good book, it taught me a lot about the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's excitement level is moderate. It's really only for educational purposes."
1,Total BS,"This ""Memoir"" is a total brainwash by a power-hungry politician and his courtier worthy of their Soviet counterparts. Kennedys almost started a nuclear war just to protect their political power, yet managed to spin this near-disaster as a great achievement with the help of servile Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. If you really want to learn the truth and not another portion of Kennedy BS, read Sheldon Stern, who based his books on ExComm transcripts and other declassified materials, not on JFK's or RFK's personal spin."
5,Moving,"This is an excellent book set in rural Bengal. The author's beautiful description of the mind of the child is really fascinating. The writing gives a feeling of reality to the description. There is actually a lot of sorrow in the book. However, the best part is that it is not oversentimental. The sorrow is subtle. One can't help being moved after reading this book.Definitely, this is one of the best books that I have read so far. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who might be interested. Reading it is an enriching experience."
2,NOT THE COMPLETE FILM,"As James Helberg has written about this tape, in a differnet box, this is NOT the complete R-rated original version of the film. It IS the stupid edit for television, missing four minutes of language and a shot of Matt Lattanzi's bare backside, as well as Bisset's in-flight orgasm. What a shame, and how stupid! Racier scenes can be found on daytime soap operas! If you love this movie and/or George Coukor, skip the VHS versions (both of them) currently offered for sale here."
5,Fascinating and excellent,I was delighted with this book. It succeeds in painting a vivid portrait of a rich ancient assemblage of tropical creatures. It doesn't skimp on the science and contains numerous anecdotal human touches. There are some amazing statistics on the relative rarities of the different forms. Well worth the money.
4,Like it!,My children have watched it over and over. But does have a litle glitch in it. But they can't stand for me to return it.So I am happy if they are happy:)
1,No Effect whatsoever!,I bought this in addition to a couple other things to add some spice to the bedroom. I sprayed this as per the instructions 2-3 sprays up to 3 times a day. I even sprayed it more and no increase in sexual drive at all. I made sure to spray it when I wasn't in the mood to test it's effectiveness and nothing happened. Don't waste your money.
4,Old Printer Meets New PC,"My old HP inkjet has only a parallel port connection. (Yeah, really old, but it still works!) And Dell didn't even list a parallel port as an option. I tried a USB adapter with no success. This plug-and-play card installed without fuss and the old printer is up and running. I'll only give it four stars, since it's way too much money for such ancient technology. But cheaper than a new printer!"
2,Color not as pictured,"The color is a dull, washed out blue. If you are looking for something vivid and cheery, this is not the cover for you. The cover seems a little small (not snug, kind of short), but has not come off yet. I have yet to find a use for the pocket."
3,Fun except for the pump,"The pump works okay for the first balloons, but it doesn't hold air (that is, if you pump up the balloon and then stop, the air leaks out through the pump). I have another, similar, pump that I have for an exercise ball and it works much better, though it looks almost the same. The Toysmith balloon necks are bigger than other brands we've tried, so they are easier to fit over the pump, which is more fun and less frustrating for kids AND parents!"
4,outside fun,"rocket balloons are fun to play with, and are duruable. if you over fill one though it will pop. if a rocket balloon gets caught in a tree, it will more likely work.rocket balloons arent good for shooting at people, becuase if they hit the street head on they will pop. there very difficult to blow up, and replacement rocket balloon pumps are hard to find. if you like rocket balloons youll love helicopter balloons. balloon powered cars dont work though."
4,Great outdoor fun,"I bought this for the grandkids today and they had such a great time that we went through most of the 50 balloons that came with the package. While I cannot endorse that the balloons can be used ""over and over again"" since many of them burst while filling with air and most burst at some point, it doesn't really matter because they absolutely loved it and the refills are very inexpensive. I will be stocking up!"
4,fun for all ages,The Rocket Balloons were great fun for my grandsons.They could do everything themselves and only required their grandfather to retrieve them from the roof! Fun to do and fun to watch.
4,fun for kids,Good choice for kids 2-10. Younger ones like it too though they may get scared. They may consider putting in 2 pumps since there are 36 balloons and kids are the pump breaks
5,MUST HAVE!,"I use this every time I go to the store. This is probably one of the most important items I have purchased for my kids. It keeps them germ free and is nice and cushioned for when they are babies and can't sit real well yet. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Buy it, you will love it. It is made really well."
3,a little disapointing,"I see almost no purpose in it. I suppose it's cool cause it holds the toys, but as far as germs go I think some disinfectant work just as well. took too long to get set up right and then rolled back up, and doesn't fit the carts at most places that I went, only standard metal one-seater carts."
1,question the safety of this device,"i thought about getting one of these for our son--until i saw his cousin nearly stand up in a high chair while still ""buckled"" in. i opted instead to get one that more securely attaches to its intended surroundings. doesn't do much good to strap your kid to the floppy seat if no part of it or the kid is actually strapped to the frame."
3,Window Fell Out,"I've had a Danby Countertop dishwasher for a couple of years now (mine was the model DDW396W). It worked pretty well until the plastic window came loose. This is apparently common with these machines--Danby has instructions on their website on how to fix it. I glued the window back in with 3M Scotch-Seal Industrial Sealant 800 and the dishwasher is now back in use. I like this machine, I just wish it was more durable. Perhaps the newer DDW496W model is a little better built."
1,Avoid Danby,I purchased this DW from Target through Amazon. It leaked like a sieve within 24 hours. Amazon was wonderful about returning it and crediting it to my charge card. This is the fifth Danby DW in three years. It works well but breaks down frequently and the service is terrible in NYC. Avoid them. Also bought a Danby frig for my vacation home. Looks great but arrived damaged. Danby was no help at all. Avoid Rainbow Appliances whose manager called me a liar when I reported the damage.
5,Danby Countertop Dishwasher- DDW496W,I have owned it for 8 months now and use it 3 times each week. It does a great job cleaning and has never once had a malfunction. For the money it was a the best purchase I have made for my home!
3,"A ""spark""ling review","The first dishwasher I was sent blew up, literally. I plugged it into the wall and there were sparks and smoke galore. I returned it and they sent me a new one, which seems to be working just fine. A slight learning curve on how to load the machine to get the best results, but overall, a good investment in roommate relations."
2,Best and worst appliance ever,"We lived in a tiny NYC apartment with no dishwasher, so this appliance really saved the day... however getting a unit that wasn't defective was a bit of a challenge. I ended up having no fewer than four dishwashers shipped to me. Two of which worked out of the box, but then ""died"" after a year of use. Three of them arrived with shipping damage, and the one that didn't had defective hosing that wouldn't attach to the unit. My latest Danby countertop dishwasher has expired after a move cross-country, something about the journey didn't agree with it. I think some water got up in the electrics.. be sure to THOROUGHLY dry the thing out for a few weeks if you ever have to move I guess. Not sure what the next step will be, as the big-box retailers have stopped selling it, mb the manufacturer has discontinued??!! Well, Godspeed if you decide to buy this guy."
4,worth it,"was it worth the price? yes, but then i am a lazy, lazy man.things it will clean well:ceramics, glassware, not much else. if you have dinnerware made out of the right materials, this is the right dishwasher for you.great unit, easy to install, leak free. very, very noisy, though it could be worse.if you wash bowls in there, don't expect anything else to get clean, the bowls will block the water from hitting anything else. do them in a seperate cycle.if you drink lots of tea like i do, make sure you hand wash off the cups first, or else the leftover bits won't get cleaned offdon't put cheap flatware in there, it will eat them alive (but then, that can be said of anything that is cheaply made being in a dishwasher)"
2,"Good, except for the leaking...","We've bought two Danby countertop dishwashers. We used the first one for about 3 years, until it stopped pumping water. We replaced it with another Danby, as we'd been happy with the first. The second Danby began leaking water quickly and severely. I eventually replaced the front loading door with the door from the first washer (which we'd saved for spare parts). That door is also now leaking, and this washer has been in service for about 1 year, maximum. We won't be buying a third."
1,review,Flooded my house. valve did not shut off. it was mess. food gets jammed. no garbage disposal.threw it away in the dumpster.
1,Didn't work - but return process was painless thanks to Amazon,"This product didn't work. Though, I've given one star because the return process was completely painless, thanks to Amazon. I've returned the non-functioning product and received a full refund."
1,Fire Hazard,"Loved the Danby, but there's a crucial design flaw. We had a burning smell for a month that we couldn't pinpoint, and it turned out that it was from our Danby. Thankfully we caught it before it caught our house on fire, but on the last wash wisp-like burnt plastic started floating in the air and around the Danby, and settled in front of it. Very dangerous. If you research online you'll find others who have had similar fire problems. Obviously they should be recalling all their countertop dishwasher products, don't know why they haven't yet."
1,Breaks Down After a Few Months.. Would Not Buy Again..,"Works fine for a few months, but then starts to develop leaking problems. Ends up flooding the counter-tops with dishwater. Don;t think I'm the only one who has encountered this problem -- see the other reviews."
3,"Works fine, but.........","Worked for two years, then kaput! The sump pump that drains water out stopped working and now water sits at the bottom of the unit and will not drain. Buyer beware."
1,great unit but it leaks,i got this because it is small had it for about 4 months worked great sometimes the knob sticks but its okay until the gasket around the window started to leak called/ email the danby service department talked to a lady said she'd send out the parts then she said id have to have a serviceman look at it if i took it in she gave me a # the man said he only makes housecalls so i'd emailed her back she said the warrenty would cover it tryed to call the serviceman back two months later he answers takes my info says hell callback after he okays my warrenty info with danby still waiting now this week the window falls off so now i cant even use it looking for a new dishwasher without the window save your money do the same cause danby service sucks
1,unpleasantly surprised,"Received the item with a small dent on top which I thought nothing of, shouldn't affect the performance I thought. But when I plug everything in, the machine just makes a whirring noise, no water spraying, no movement of the dial. After 15 optimistic minutes, I gave up. Returning back for exchange. Crossing my fingers for the next box."
3,nice intro into melanesia,"An informative and at times entertaining read about Papua New Guinea and it's surrounding islands. The author interweaves his story of travel with the history of various explorers, missionaries, and local personages. He describes the various impacts modernization has had on the islands and discusses the effects missionaries, colonization, and the world wars have wrought. The book provides good insight to places rarely written about and the author colorfully describes various festivals, arts, and customs. I enjoyed the book although at times it slowed and a sense of sanctimony occasionally pervades the work. The book whetted my appetite to learn more about the region's history and art and an extensive bibliography is provided."
5,Delves into the magic of these largely unspoiled colonies,"The isolated islands of the Coral, Solomon and Bismarck Seas were the last to be explored by Europeans, leading author Michael Moran to delve into the magic of these largely unspoiled colonies. BEYOND THE CORAL SEA travels the footsteps of some of the early explorers of the Coral Sea islands, considering history, cultural changes, and anthropological facts."
2,difficult to relate to,"I received this book as a gift to read while recovering from surgery. I plodded through the preface and first few chapters, then had to resort to skimming the rest. I found it cumbersome and verbose -- filled with long-winded sentences, lofty and uncommon language (I had to keep my dictionary at hand), and references that were entirely unknown to me. One might say it was over my head I suppose. The best parts were her descriptions of the simple but heavenly foods she recalled from her childhood. Other than that, and her account of life in Quaker Whittier CA, I didn't find much in this memoir that I cared about. I know that her prose is highly regarded, but it was lost on me. I have not read any of her other books."
2,"Definitely ""cumbersome and verbose""","I must agree with the review that finds this book clumsy, wordy, and difficult to read. Ultimately it's just boring. While I have no trouble understanding her vocabulary, and usually prefer writers who use involved sentences, Fisher rambles and doesn't use her vocabulary or sentence structure to good effect. I'm not sure she has a clear idea of what she wants to say, and her observations on other people in her life seem mean-spirited and cynical. She pretends to have enjoyed the Quakers, yet portrays them in an extremely negative and biased manner, basing many of her conceptions on what she presumes they must have thought and felt. She doesn't recognize that she may have misinterpreted their actions through the filter of her own childhood ideas. I read it for a Book Club, but what a chore to get through it."
5,Works for me,"Works as promised..a little difficult to install perfectly the first time, but you can wash and retry."
2,Scratches easily,Product is difficult in adhering without air bubbles present. Takes quite a bit of time and effort to remove the bubbles and you will never be able to remove all of them. Film also scratches very easily but will live with it based on the cost of the film and knowing what I would need to go through to reinstall it. Unfortunately it is a necessary evil as you cannot see the IPAD screen without it if you are at the beach or driving in your car.
1,An exercise in frustration,"An exercise in frustration. What's worse, bubbles or fingerprints? BUbbles, because you can wipe away fingerprints. I spent way too much time trying to apply this, I followed instructions precisely, and the amount of dust bubbles increased with every passing moment. I suspect that without a clean room (I'm talking the official 'clean room') this just can't be done properly. I'm going to return this product."
1,Impossible to install,"This screen protector is impossible to install. I have installed MULTIPLE other screen protectors on cell phones, cameras, ipods, etc. My husband and I worked for over 2 hours and still couldn't install the screen protector without a number of large bubbles...that was with the help of lint free cloths, a reasonably dust free room, compressed air container and BoxWave's recommended scotch tape. It was VERY frustrating. I contacted the company for help and their answer was to install in a dust free environment, like the shower. Really? The worst news, the screen protector can't be returned after installation has been attempted. I can NOT recommend this product. It was a waste of money."
1,Too many bubbles,"The description of this product stated it was bubble free but it is not. I knew that due to the size of the I-Pad bubbles would be a problem. Thats why I chose this product, but there were just as many bubbles or even more with this product. I basically overpaid for what I thought would be a better product."
5,definitely my cup of tea,"If I had to recommend one book to my non-reading friends, this would be it. I read the whole thing in one sitting and was totally fascinated. Jane King is funny, smart and I hope she actually looks like the picture on the cover, which is perfect, particularly if you notice the slight tension in how she holds her mouth. Great book, I can't wait for her next one."
1,Not Quite True,"I am also a graduate of this school and this book gives a far from accurate view. Hardly anyone who attends the school is a rich, love-struck, anorexic. Readers should be aware of the sweeping generalizations and the elementary writing style which characterizes this biased book."
2,"Got the nuns down, but lost the audience","I attended Santa Catalina with Jane King. Another reviewer mentioned that Patty Hearst attended years earlier. This is not correct; she was a sophomore when we were freshmen. She was booted out soon after...Jane got the nuns just right. Her details were pretty much the way I remember. She captured the stifling aura of the place, but I can't understand how anyone who didn't go there would read this. Her writing was surely less than adequate. Indeed, a lot more could have been done with this material. I wanted to like this book, but the poor writing got in the way."
2,I go to catalina!,"I go to Catalina and i have nothing against it. At first i was not too happy at the school, i admit, but it gets better. She was just trying to make our school look bad. Maybe she just didn't fit intto Catalina. Maybe it wasnt right for her. But for others, it might be the ideal school. Maybe she didnt fit in, or maybe the types of girls that go to catalina arent the types of girls she hangs around. Personally, i think the girls at Catalina are wonderful. Nobody is negative towards other girls. I think that it fit me and maybe it didnt fit her. She also wrote the book long after she left the school, and may not have had the best picture of it in her mind. She may have only remembered the negative parts about Catalina, and not the positive ones. She may not remember what positive things happened to her at Catalina. She wrote the book well and she gave her opinion on the school, even though it might not be someone else's. That is why i gave her two stars."
4,Did sister Carlotta require Santa Catalina freshman review?,"Was it required by all Santa catalina freshman to write negtive reviews of Jane King's novel? I think that those of us who asre now alumni can look back at the experince now and agree with Ms. King. Personally, I think she went far easier on the school than most of us would have. She provides a very neutral view about things. Except for a minor critique of the nuns ( and hwo wouldn't critique sister christine), and a little stress about grades, the book is very uninsulting. Next time I would like a more recent alumni to write a real story of what goes on behind ""the virgin wall""."
1,absence makes the heart grow bitter,"As a present student of Catalina, I feel I have a responsibility to respond to this novel. I have to agree that Cataline is not for everyone. However, finding out one is in all honors classes would not make one faint. I don't believe that the school putting in you in higher classes constitues frantic mind spinning fear. I think Ms. King is misinterpreting homesickness and freshmen jitters to paranoia and hate for the school without giving it a proper chance, and hating it before anything happened. Besides the basic content being mildly hateful, for a nonfiction book, it sure has a lot of the actual people and places within. Maybe had you giving Catalina a chance at all, it would have been written better all around."
5,perfect for what it is,"I thought it was funny that this author pissed so many people off. King has written in the perfect writing style for what she was trying to say in this book. If I had a complaint, it would simply be that she didn't convey more emotion."
1,So What?,"""Zero stars"" rating was not a choice...I have a daughter at Santa Catalina, so I read this book from front to back looking for a good laugh, maybe some secret revelations or even the tiniest shred of evidence that the scandals hinted at on the cover were true. Disappointed! This is not only one of the most poorly written books I've ever bothered to pick up (this writing skill comes from Catalina honors classes? That's the only real slap in the face to the school to be found here!), it's certainly the most boring. No scandal here - except that a mailer to Catalina alumnae has generated such undeserved attention and profits. I can only guess that the author was performing some kind of mid-life catharsis by committing this disjointed and unmemorable name-dropping memoir to the printed page. And I'd wager that the friends and family in NY whose rave reviews poured in also ponied up the funds for a publisher. Who else would bother?"
1,I go to Catalina now!,"I attend Catalina now and I have to say that what this lady has written about Catalina is completely the oppsite. Some girls are made for Catalina, not everyone can go there and have a great time. Yes, you can be smart and have the grades to get in, but if you are not Catalina material, then you aren't going to enjoy your expirence. Obviously, Ms. King was not Catalina material! If she were, she would have had a different outlook on Catalina! An outlook that every college, student, graduate, and TIME magazine have!!"
1,au contraire,"As a student at Catalina, my expereince here is completely opposite to how she felt. This school is amazing and she obviously could not see that! She obviously did have the drive or the will power to find out what an amazing place Catalina actually is."
4,The rated R Superstar!!,Very cool story of the man called Edge aka Adam Copeland. I've been a big wrestling fan pretty much my whole life & I've seen wrestlers come & go but Edge is definitely a wrestler that truly loved what he did. He grew up as a fan of wrestling & always believed he would be a superstar himself. This is a great story & definitely worth getting
2,Disappointed.......,"The quality of the steamer shown in the picture vs what was shipped to me is far from the product I received. The steamer was shipped poorly by USPS in a box that was way too small even with taping the box for shipment to me the box would not fully close, the steamer was not smooth and nice looking like the picture it was peeling and of poor quality. Needless to say I was pissed with this purchase I didnt send it back wasn't worth spending any further on shipping I just took a loss I do not plan to order from this seller again."
4,very good,This is the best way ever to cook fish. Then in a bottom layer cook broccoli and in a top layer spinach leaves. Turns out great.
1,watch out,"I bought a Movado watch like this one. Since I bought it at Macy's, I am reviewing only the watch. A few weeks after purchase, I realized the watch was slow. It was sent back to Movado (I could not get my money back because I contacted Macy's 40 days after the purchase). Two weeks later, I was informed that they need another 4-6 weeks. Obviously, I am unhappy with this watch and the way Movado handles this.In my opinion, for the price, look for a more reliable manufacturer with a sense of concern regarding their customers.Finally, Macy's did replace the watch without asking me to wait the 4-6 weeks."
2,She deserves better!,"Lousy sound and mix, the drums being the worst recorded. The amateurish arrangements don't help either. Ms.Regina needed the kind of playing & production that other great Nascimento interpreters such as Flora Purim & Kevyn Lettau have received on their recordings."
1,This Product SUCKS!!,"Be WarnedAlthough this dish brush may have a friendly sticker price its not worth it. My Fiance and I bought this at BedBath & Beyond two months after the purchase the plastic handle broke. We were left with the mesh ball attached to a plastic stub. About a month after that the mesh ball separated from the plastic stub entirely and we were just left with a mesh ball. Other considerations: the bristles on the mesh ball do not scrub out the grim very well, grease and grim holds in between the mesh bristles, and the flashy shiny handle becomes a slipper surface when wet and soapy. So to recap:-Hard to hold-Does NOT clean well-BRAKES VERY easily"
3,Star Brite Plastic Polish Restorer,"This product did not work on my brown 1983 celica GTS inside door handles damaged from UV sun rays over the years. However,I have not yet found a non-paint product that will work noticeably on these smooth hard plastic surfaces other than some bring-back-the-black type products. A clear-coat paint spray is probably my next move for restoration. In all fairness, this product may work well on other plastics, but the ""Restorer"" designation was the reason I purchased it to try. I'm sure I'll put it to use on other automotive surfaces for further evaluation."
5,movado kara watch...love it.,"This is the first MOVADO watch i have, it is so feminine; goes well with any outfit, this is my favorite everyday watch. Simple yet elegant. I never go wrong in buying this."
5,I finally have a Movado,I love this watch. I have many watches and have always wanted a Movado! I received this as a Christmas gift and have worn it everyday since. I receive alot of compliments and am very proud. I would highly recommend this purchase to everyone. This is a very classy watch which wears well during the office hours and looks great into evenings out. Buy it!
4,wonderful watch,"This watch is a great design and it is a wonderful time piece. The other reviews are right that the band does get scratched up, and I also had to get my watch re sized once I received it. This can be done at any jewelry store, and I had it done for about 15 dollars. The face does not scratch at all, however, it is still as clean as the day I got it. If you have any worries that you will not be able to read the face because it is so minimal in design, you get used to it really quickly and it doesn't bother me at all now. I love this watch and I wear it every day."
5,Great price for a great watch,"I love the watch I purchased on Amazon. It was a great deal, considering I saw the exact watch in a jewelry store for double the price I paid on Amazon. Great buy!!"
2,Warranty Deception,"Beware any Movado watch advertised as covered by a Manufacturer warranty, this is deceptive. Movado watches sold by Amazon are not covered by the Movado warranty. I have advised Amazon of the deceptive practice but some watches still show warranty as provided by manufacturer. Don't be deceived as I was. Nice watch but understand that what you are buying is not what is advertised."
3,Mediocre at best...,"This watch is mediocre at best. I gave to to my wife for an early Christmas present. Her face and my face best captured the moment, faces that just weren't too excited about it, and simply said ""oh"". It's fine for an everyday watch. Why the watch is advertised as a $500 watch, and sells for just over $200 tells me that it is a $200 watch, not $500. Nice advertising scheme. Everywhere I look it sells for $200.To me the watch just had a very cheap feel to it. Feels very light, too light. So I don't expect it to be too durable or long lasting. The ""diamond"", or whatever the thing at the 12 o'clock position, looks very cheap up close. My wife asked if it was a ""mini-mirror"" :) It certainly looks like one, or maybe a sequin that fell off a dress.Overall it's an average watch. If I had to do it again I would not have bought this watch. This gift was intended to be her ""nice"" watch, for special occassions - it doesn't get it done."
1,Beautiful watch but...,I never received this watch from Amazon.I don't know what's going on and i've talked to both usps and amazon.
3,Nice watch,"Aside from the many surface scratches, the lack of a direct Movado warranty, and the fact that I must have the watch sized, it is a pretty good watch."
2,An Anomaly,"Old Hands is somewhat of an oddity in the young YMSB catalog that I just cannot get into. Understand, I love this band, have their other discs and see them every time they come through town, but them covering a dozen or so Benny Galloway tunes doesn't feel like (or at times sound like) a YMSB disc. The disc gets off to a good start with the Dixie-infused ""Pride of Alabama"" and ""Hill Country Girl,"" but things take a turn south on ""Big Lights"" (which features Galloway) and the irritating ""Deep Pockets."" The remainder of the disc is pretty much hit-or-miss: if you like that classic YMSB sound you'll enjoy ""Train Bound for Glory Land"" and ""Wind Thru the Willows,"" but the numerous Galloway-sung tunes may give you pause. Overall, the pairing of YMSB and Benny Galloway has a few bright spots, but rarely, if ever, finds its way into my CD player."
3,"Not the YMSB I love, but OK","I love YMSB. Have every CD. See them whenever they come around. I love progressive and jam band music (Phish especially). But this project is more of a Country & Western sound. No doubt due to the Galloway influence.It's very well produced and performed, but not as good (IMHO) as the pure, uninhibited jamgrass sound that YMSB has mastered.The included movie file is great and a MUST for all YMSB fans."
1,Totally Bogus Flick,"This short (41 min.) marginally in focus low resolution homemade flick contains no meaningful trekking information whatsoever. The name and contents are entirely misleading. The flick in fact focusses on some guy who's intent on spreading american western culture and values to the centuries old world and culture of the Nepalese through giving books to schools, and then bringing his friends there to show them what he's done. He apparently believes that if the Nepalese are more like us then they would be happier.They march on in their bright goretex outfits, lacking meaningful contact with the locals while their porters carry all their western comforts.-Go figure-"
5,an unforgettable character,"I went to bed last night and woke up this morning thinking and caring about Ruthie Tepper -- her open heart, her longing and confusion, her shoulders shaking from trying to hold in her giggles. Sarah Lamstein has created an unforgettable character. Every moment of her story seems true."
2,Order Extremely Early or You'll Get the Book Extremely Late,"When I first placed my order, the expected delivery time was 3 to 15 business days so I thought that I would receive the book well within that time frame. I ordered on March 4, but didn't receive the book until March 26. By that time, my class was over and I had no use for the book. If I had known that the seller would take so much time to mail the book I would have ordered from somewhere else. I can't comment on the quality of the merchandise because I still haven't opened the package. I asked the seller for a refund and she told me no. I am stuck with a book I no longer need."
5,I love my Snoogle!,"I recently received my Snoogle and it's been a HUGE help in sleeping. I'm a light sleeper anyway and being 4 months pregnant I could never get comfortable, but now I can actually sleep comfortably for significant portions of the night. It's great for naps too. Highly recommend this to ANY one for sleeping."
1,Pregnant and Still Uncomfortable,"First of all, this product looks nothing like the picture - it's not fluffy and full at all. It's about 5"" in diameter. I was expecting a comfortable pillow after months of not sleeping while pregnant. This was just the opposite. It didn't have enough substance to keep me still on my side so I woke up incredibly sore all over my body. And now I am stuck with it because I just read that pillows are non-returnable. This product was very disappointing. I am going to splurge on a fuller pillow."
2,false advertising!,"This really is not a DJ Cheb cd, since he was only involved in 5 of the 14 tracks. The other 9 are entirely by other people. Don't be misled. It's diverse and doesn't hang together, just a collection of tracks with no coherence."
5,Wonderful recipes and easy cookbook to use!,I have already tried many of the wonderful recipes and had good luck with all of them. Two newly-married daughters have the cookbook also and the book was great for them as beginner cooks-even their husbands who like to cook have tried recipes in the book!
1,Yikes! Don't buy this book,"My son is in love with forklifts. I have looked and looked for a book to answer his questions. But this book is a giant disappointment - especially considering the price. This book must have been thrown together in about an hour - max. The few snapshot-quality photos show only one forklift at one site, unloading lumber. Where are the different types of forklifts??? What types of jobs do forklifts do in warehouses, at construction sites, etc.??? Honestly, where was the book editor on this one?"
4,A great collection of images,"This book is a compilation of images that Ansel compiled into portfolios, along with a brief introduction by the author. Some of these images can be found in other compilations, but are more powerful here because they are grouped as Ansel chose to group them. Each of his portfolios is well printed, for a book printing of a silver image that is, and his statement is included for each, just as in the actual editions. Overall, this is a nice compilation of images, and an opportunity to see them grouped as the photographer felt they should be. There are few enough words, with the major focus being on the main subject, his images. This is a great addition to the library of any Adams fan, but is not an indispensable tome."
4,a good solid history,"This is a good comprehensive, although somewhat dry, Roman history that spans the period between the mythical founding of Rome and the final destruction of Carthage. The first few chapters go deep into archeological and literary sources, and discuss all the theories about where the Etruscans came from, when exactly a city formed on the seven hills, what the early political structure was like, etc. The rest is a straightforward narrative of Rome's rise to Mediterranean dominance--the author, H.H. Scullard, maintaining that Rome had imperalism thrust upon it, suggesting interesting parallels with American history. To complement the military-centric narrative, there are large appendixes about religion, art, literature, law, and social customs of the period."
5,Wonderfully Durable Version,This wood version of the game is wonderfully durable. It looks attractive when playing and when on the shelf. It has a classic aged look.
4,Monopoly,This had a great strudy wodden box and was well taken care off even if it was open it looked brand new and my husband loved it.
5,Honest Documentary about an Indie Animation Giant,"I attended a screening of this in New York and really enjoyed it! If you've ever seen a Bill Plympton film you'll get the general tone of the documentary: part humor, part edge, and all completely self-honest. Some great interviews like Maureen McElheron talking about ""Your Face"" and ""The Tune"", the great Terry Gilliam, Tom Kenny, Martha Plimpton, really give some extra depth to the films we know so well... and Ed Begley, Jr.'s bit was hilarious (when you see it you'll know what I mean)!Really, if you like Bill Plympton's animated films you just need to see this -- it's kind of that simple. It's informative, inspiring, and fun."
4,Steelers License plate,My nephew was very happy with the quality of this product and has it on his car
2,Navigon 7100 GPS Disappointing,"The Navigon is a very slick package, and gets the job done, but not as well as other comparable GPS units. The screen graphics are good, but most of the POIs are in lettering that is too small to read, especially while driving. POIs are difficult to locate, and many do not seem to be in the data base. You cannnot download your phone book from your cell phone, so that each number you call must be manually entered the first time. The touch screen is difficult to use, since many of the numbers, letters, and other choices are quite small, and the screen itself is not very sensitive. However, once you enter a destination, the voice directions are excellent. For the same price or less, I would stick to Garmin."
3,Directing a GPS,"We are going to travel to Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, Maryland, Carolinas and Georgia. A GPS seemed a great investment to get us from one place to the next. Just doing a trial run in Texas where we live, I find I have to give so many specific directions and the Navigon needs more help than it gives in areas I know well. Does not make me feel secure about being directed in areas we do not know. I enjoy the 3D view. The 'voice' also does not know that you have one mile and two miles. She says in one miles... guess we will learn her methodology.She is classy looking!"
2,Defective on arrival.....Speaker distortion,"Upon testing the unit on arrival, I discovered the speaker distorts on any setting above the lowest position. The earbuds work without distortion, so the speaker must be defective. I have not checked on possibly returning or repair options."
3,Where's the Instructional CD(ROM),The Navigon 7100 is an excellent looking product straight out of the box and would have been better if i had some functional instructions to go with this product..
2,Navigon 7100,Gives wrong directions! Take a map because you'll be misdirected from time to time. + It will take you the long way around instead of direct.
2,GPS Good...UI Horrible!,"Keep it short and simpleThe touch screen is okay but the buttons are too small. The UI is horrible. It is not intuitive and is hard to navigate. Other than that, it is an adequate GPS unit. Now I am going back to my old Garmin. The one that looks like a old mini TV."
1,Bad GPS !,"A lot of streets were incorrect , and some areas didn't have streetsI would not recommend anyone this product."
3,This s not a perfect GPS but it's ok,"I own this GPS (Navigon 7100 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator ) since June 2008 its not a perfect one but its ok. Since I bought this GPS I have used this GPS extensively while travelling from Chicago to New York city, Houston and Florida and enjoyed it. Most surprising about this GPS is it does not have map of Downtown Chicago. This GPS has old highway information out dated highway speed. I tried to look for updated maps for this GPS but found none for this model. Navigon should update this maps periodically and push to the gps for free of charge. It does not have auto day and night switch you have to manually switch it. It has most terrible long windshied holder that come with this GPS.I will give 3 stars for this GPS because of bad customer service and support."
2,Dont buy!!!,"One you actually get this going its good. But looooong startups, sometimes it takes 20 minutes to find my position. Too difficult to punch in keys with fingers, must use stylus. The operating system is chopping, they almost had something good. I bought the Garmin Nuvi and I love it."
3,Navigon 7100,"Excellent product and Amazons price was the best. Navigon is relativerly new here in the US and extra mounts or antenna are not available here yet. The mount that comes with the unit is super and I wanted to purchase a second mount for my second vehicle. The parent company in Germany shows all accesories on their web site but the price in Euro's which is cost prohibitive to have shipped here. The unit itself is excellently made, clear screen and very clear speach. I found it very strange that the US distributor doesn't have access to all the accessories yet and that is a problem. I've written a message to the parent company and the US distributor using their web site and have not received a response in over two weeks. They advertise a response to most messages within 48 hrs. The US distributor does respond to phone calls. Possibly these are just growing pains of a new company here in the US. If you want a excellent product but can tollerate poor support this is an excellent buy."
4,Excellent buy for the money,"I have only had the Navigon 7100 for a few weeks. It worked right out of the box. The free traffic service seems to work. I really like the reality view when approaching a major intersection. Since I have not been on a road trip yet I have only used it around town.CONS: Need to have updated maps more frequently. I live in a new section of Sugar Land, TX so the roads and POI of not close to what they are now since the map and POI's are about a year old."
3,NAVIGON 7100,THE GPS IS VERY HARD TO SET A DESTINATION AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO FIND A RESTAURANT TO EAT AT IT WILL ONLY SHOW THE ONE'S IN A 0.3 MILE AREA.YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO BRING UP A MAP AND TELL IT TO FOLLOW THIS DIRECTION.AND AS FOR THE FREE TRAFFIC WELL I HAVEN'T HAD IT HELP ME YET AND I WAS IN DALLAS TRAFFIC SITTING FOR 45 MINS. MY OLD GARMIN WAS GOOD BUT I WANTED TO UP DATE THIS UNIT DOSEN'T DO IT.
4,Pretty good Product,This is my first GPS unit so i have nothing to really compare this product to. I've used this GPS unit for 2 weeks now. The screen display is amazing and the text to speech is pretty accurate. The lane-assistant is a great feature and helps driving in unfamiliar areas. The TMC feature is also great and lets me how bad the traffic is while i'm drivingFew cons of this product is1.) It sometimes thinks i'm on the correct road when i'm actually on the road parallel to it2.) The traffic updates only works when i have the external antenna plugged in3.) It doesn't calculate the shortest time route all the time. I compared this by using the route it suggested when i went home. It kind of went in a round-a-about way.However despite these cons i plan to keep this product
1,"Great features, but unreliable","I purchased a 7100 7 months ago. It has been plagued with software problems. Fortunately their tech support is readily available and helpful. I have over 50 hrs. into troubleshooting on my own and with their help. They replaced the unit twice and the SD card twice. The earlier problems have not resurfaced, but the third unit locks up during route calculation/recalculation. That really messes me up when in heavy Seattle or Portland traffic.Even though they cannot fix it, they absolutely refuse to refund my money. Don't buy it.If they had the bugs worked out it would be a great GPS. The features are fantastic. I have not experienced the functional problems that others have reported."
3,Terrible Battery,"I like the unit. The 3D display is great, it is easy to use, and so far it seems accurate. However, I only gave it 3 stars because the battery life is terrible. On a full charge, mine will only run for about 30 minutes...tops. The car charger takes forever to bring the battery back up to a full charge, and if I plug it into an ""always-on"" accessory port, it will drain my car battery overnight. Much more draw than leaving a light on in the car. And my car battery is new."
4,Great Unit But Text Too Small,"This unit is every bit as good as a Garmin Nuvi that I also own, except that the text on the screen is too small unless you have perfect vision. The reality view is a huge plus over the Garmin. A few software problems out of the box such as rerouting always stated ""make a u-turn"" and didn't try to route you any other way; but after updating the software through their website it works pretty good. Also, the reality views were limited until I updated. Not dissapointed. Recommended to anyone."
4,Navigon 7100,"I do like this product, it has all the requirements for a GPS system. The free traffic is always up-to-date and very convenient to avoid those traffic jams.The only draw back is the US Navigon techical support, as they direct you to the European sites. Also the web site is coming up to speed to support US. But generally I am happy with the product."
1,Do NOT buy,This item is a very poor excuse for a NAV system. First off touch screen requires you to use a hard nail or you get no response. Second the battery life is terrible. Barely lasts one hour or so. Dont even want to go into the screen is not bright and the several other shortfalls.I will predict this company will not survive so do not buy something that is poorly designed as this. I will also tell you I never ever complain on the many many tech items I buy. But this unit is so poor I had to comment. Just printed the return label and back to Amazon it goes.
1,Nice Gps Had a problem they could have cared less.,I accidentally broke the car charger. A USB will charge it but not operate at same time. Even offered to pay. The basically told me in so many words that they could care less. At some time in the future will have an accessory shop. These things cost little or nothing at the OEM level. I ended up having a very techno friend fix it by sheer luck. They were quick to respond and very unhelpful.
2,good luck finding anything without the exact city,"If you have the address it works great, but if you dont know the exact city that it is located then it seems next to impossible to find a location. While searching for a ski resort in new york i didnt know the city that it was located so i entered search nationwide setting from there the only places that showed up were aspen colorado and vail. Once i finally got the city name it showed right up. Overall works great if you have all of the info already but good luck trying to find something new and the poi database sucks if are not in a big city."
1,close but no cigar,"I was looking for an upgrade to my Nuvi 680 and this unit is NOT it. It has some great features, everything is included i.e. traffic and Zagat guide. (these cost extra on a Nuvi) Good graffics... sort of... if you can see them. The size of the information on the screen is so small that if you are in the over 40 crowd and use reading glasses you can't see the info. Side by side with my nuvi 680 traffic winner Nuvi, shortest routes winner Nuvi, accuracy of routes winner Nuvi. After a few days with the Navigon I couldn't wait to put my Nuvi 680 back into full time use. Navigon has some nice features but it's not ready for competition with the class of the lot GARMIN."
3,POI,"Point of interests are very less & not able to find walmart, costco.. and so on. We have to feed the complete address. Most times we will not be having complete address for POI. Weight of this model little bit more."
2,not as good as garmin nuvi,"I bought this product to replace my lost Garmin nuvi 360. My friend recommended it to me and i thought it would outlive my expectations but then no. I am dismayed with the stand and/or connector. it's too long and not discrete. As you all know that gps are one of the ""hot stuff"" being stolen these days and with that kind of connector, you would increase the likelihood of your unit being stolen and storage wise, it'll need a big space in yout car. I was disappointed as well with data input, if you have garmin nuvi, you know what i mean. The unit never lasted my hand for 24hrs, i returned it back and got the same garmin nuvi i had before and it never failed to amaze me."
4,Review 7100 Navigon,We found 2 faults the volume could be louder and needs a mans voice.Also could use auto dimmer for night.It does tell you what side of street your location is on which is very helpful. Screen very good.Gives enough notice for turns.
2,Too Complicated,"First of all - It looks great. Looks can be deceiving. I ordered the 7100 which came with a rebate that needed to be sent by the 30th day. Well, I sent it on the 31st date and they would not even give an exception to this policy. Navigon is not about customer service. They said there are no exceptions. Well, I decided to keep it. There are some cool features: (1). It saves any of your destinations, (2). Informs you when you go over the speed limit, (3). Count down your destination in time and miles. Locating POI's is too complicating and when you enter a specific place like Starbucks, it will not locate it unless you choose it from the list. Last but not least, after 2 1/2 months it simply failed to turn on. Not working at all. Good thing Costco accepts return if you are simply not satisfied. I was not satisfied. Hope this helps."
5,Navigate with the Navigon,"I have no complaints about this model. Working in construction and having to travel to numerous locations, this navigation system has saved me tons of time and money. I have had no problems picking up a signal despite what Gadgester has said. The 7100 picks it up almost instantly. The many options on the 7100 such as traffic reports, local landmark finder, optional preferences, etc. make the 7100 fitting for all drivers. Picks up even the smallest streets. Great user manual and great capabilities with the memory card. I highly recommend this sleak model to all. All of my co-workers now want one. You won't be dissapointed."
1,NAVIGON PIECE OF JUNK,"DON'T BUY THIS C**P. IT'S THE WORST GPS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! I HAVE TO CHECK GOOGLE MAPS BEFORE I LEAVE MY HOUSE, BECAUSE THIS JUNK IS TAKING ME CIRCLES, THROUGH SHOPPING CENTERS. IT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING WOORTHLESS DEVICE EVER. AND NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN REACH CUSTOMER SERVICE."
3,Not a durable Item,"Touch screen not sensetive enough,Small buttons, I didnt like it comparing to my old Garmin."
1,don't buy it,"i've got it for 2 weeeks, then i coudln't stand how slow and inaccurate it works, so i returned it to store... now i have garmin nuvi 760. and it's worth its price!!"
4,product review from Francis,"This product is nice. What I like about it is that when you come across multiple juctions, it will bring up a 3D image showing you the road and which one to follow with couple of arrows.I had a little problem when I purchased this product. The map that came with the product was not working. I called on the saller and they asked if I want to exchange it for another one which I refused. I called on the manufacturer and they sent me a new map which took couple of days, but they did send it. Over all, will I recomend this product to people? I will say YES. It is easy to use, It warns you ahead of time if there is traffic and gives you an alternate road to follow. It is so cool to use at night because it uses the 3D image. It is far better than the Navman that I paid almost $600 when these products just came out."
1,Totally disappointed!,"I was not happy with my Garmin Nuvi 350 so I was looking for an alternative. I tried the Navigon 7100 but, man, is it one of the worst GPS units out there. The main problems are: first, it takes FOREVER to get a satellite signal, even in open areas. I think the average time of getting it into navigatable mode from powering on is like 10 minutes, which is absolutely unacceptable. Second, it's very slow, esp. when it tries to show fancy ""reality view"" graphics. You'll likely miss a turn because it can't keep up with your driving. Routing engine is even worse than the not-so-good one in the Nuvi 350, which costs half as much. This is just such a huge disappointment as I was hoping to finally replace my Nuvi."
4,Navigon 7100 Widescreen,"After spending a lot of time looking and reading reviews for all the other types of navigation systems, this one had the least amount of complaints. I have found that most of the peoples complaints are because they did not take the time to read the manual or call Navigon for assistance. Very user friendly. There are some POIs that are missing, but through the Navigon website you can suggest to the company that Navigon works with to add the POI, also you can let them know when there is a wrong address for a POI, or the POI doesn't need to be on there."
4,Very good product!,"This is my first GPS so I have limited background. I have found it to be a very good product and particularly like the 3D view which indicates which lane to be in when a road splits.The traffic reporting is quite limited as it just says the word ""caution"" but doesn't give any actual traffic report.Sometime the routing is not the best as it does not take into account traffic patterns and stoplights so it may not be the fastest route when you consider that. That is ok when you know the area but when you go out of town, it may not take you the best route.Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoy it."
4,Navigon 7100,"I love the display and the precision of the directions given. Navigating the options take a little getting used to, but once you figure it out you're good to go."
2,No customer support,"I have owned a Navigon 7100 along with a 3 year subscription to fresh maps for 2 years. The unit works well except for a few routing issue and I receive email notifications that the fresh map update is available periodically. When I download it and try to install it, it always says the file is corrupted and will not install. I have attempted to contact Navigon customer support on numerous occasions with no success. They do not reply to the the emails sent to them from their customer support web links. There is no phone number to reach customer support that I can find. It is very frustrating since I paid $80 for the fresh maps subscription. Any help contacting these people would be appreciated"
1,Couldn't be more disappointed,"I read and read all about the Navigon 7100 along with several other models by various manufacturers. I also watched the demo video. I was convinced I would love this one. Trying to find restaurants was next to impossible. You could not type in the name of a restaurant unless you had the name of the city you would be in and even when I did know the name of the city and the name of the restaurant that was no guarantee that the Navigon could find it. Also, the distances would not update while driving around trying to scroll down to find a place to eat. It is not user friendly. I am accustomed to an old Garmin and it is far superior to the Navigon."
4,Love the free traffic information!,"Everything about this navigation device is great!!! Especially the free traffic report.One downside though, the volume on the bluetooth device is so low it's basically useless! I guess I have to re-install my parrot bluetooth."
4,learning to use the 7100,I am a new user. To date I have been impressed with the unit. I wish that the logbook feature that uploads to a spred sheet would work from the turn by turn page. I would like to view the entire trip on hard copy.My unit is locked on eastern time. The logbook must have the first leg entered before you start.
3,navigon 7100,"the desighn is wonderful and thas as far as i could go with the pros. now customer service is so bad, make u want to through this product in the trash. the stand that comes with it does not hold well, so the unit fall down while driving, although the traific updates are great, the point of interest is useless. i had better luck with the nagavation on my phone with verizion."
5,GPS THE BEST ON THE MARKET,"tHIS IS FAR BETTER THAN YOUR OTHERE GPS SYSTEMS OUT THERE, iT WILL TAKE YOU RIGHT TO THE PLACE OF ENTERY. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS ,AS OF YET, BATTERY LIFE COULD BE ALOT BETTER."
2,unsatisfactory,"Just took it out of the box and read very little instructions that came with the unit. Had to go on line to get manual of 100 pages wow what a disappointment. Have to use stylus to enter addresses etc. Sorry but not good for my use, put in back in the box and returned it not used. Ordered a garmin 650 I love it."
2,Disappointed,"I read many caution statements about this product, but I thought it would serve my purpose. I tried to overlook the mistakes it made and really tried to find reasons to keep this product. However, just like the reviews - slow connection with satelite, poi's that were not there, strange routing directions in well-know areas of travel, therefore, did not trust it in unknown areas. I'm still in need of a gps for my christmas travels, and will continue to look. Result -RETURNED."
1,bad customer service,"I was going to buy this unit to test it. After reading reviews I decided to call NavigonUSA customer service to find out about SD card,if unit comes with 2 or 4 gb. After about 15 minutes on hold, customer service rep picked up, and advised me that they are very busy righ now, and asked me to leave a number. ( He did not even asked me how can he help me, or purps. of my call)I gave him my cell number,and I was told that somebody would call me back withing the next 48 hours. I was very surprised! I do not remember anything like that even dealing with outsorsing companies from India!By the way.... nobody called me back."
2,i'm with not happy,"if you have a PH DEGREE in navation, then this the one for you.every one else don't waste your money."
2,NICE BUT NOT FOR ME,"I OWN THE NAVIGON FOR 2 WEEKS AND WAS VERY DISEPOINTED.TO START WITH THE MOUNT CAN BE USED ON CAR WINDSHIELD ONLY AND I DRIVE A TRUCK SO THE WINDSHIELD IS FLAT AND I COULDN'T USE IT.AT NIGHT THE SCREEN IN THE LOWEST BRIGHTNESS IS TOO BRIGHT AND ANNOYING.I WANTED TO KNOW SPEED LIMITS NOT JUST ON THE INTERSTATE BUT ON US HWY BUT THE NAVIGON DON'T HAVE THAT INFO.I HAD TO RUN FROM CHICAGO TO DETROIT AND HAD TO USE SOME TOLLS BUT DIDN'T WANT TO GO ON IN TPK AND OH TPK SO I HAVE TRY TO GET THE ROUTH CHANGED AND THE UNIT WAS VERY SLOW TO CALCULATE.ON INTERSTATE THE NAVIGON WILL TALK A LOT MORE THAN REQUIRED AND IT WILL NOT BE JUST "" GO 100 MI "" , IN INTERSTATE DRIVING EVERY CROSS INTERSTATEWILL TELL YOU TO KEEP GOING STRAIGHT EVEN THAT YOU KNOW THAT.IT WAS ALSO HARD TO GET TO THE POI THAT I WAS LOOKING TO FIND AND WAS HARD TO ONDERSTAND HOW TO PUT A POI IN OR HOW TO USE MANY OPTIONS.IM TIRED OF WRITINGTHERES MORE BUT YOU RTY IT FOR YOURSELF"
2,Disappointed with Navigon 7100,"Navigon 7100 GPS Portable Automobile NavigatorI purchased the Navigon 7100 thinking I would be getting a big screen easy to read for the money. The trouble is the image is smaller than the smaller screen of the Garmin Nuvi 360. The Navigon 7100 does not prompt very quick when you make a wrong turn and recalulate. It also does not promt you far enough ahead of time, when your turn is coming up. It prompts you when you get right there. The Navigon is a lot harder to work with. I returned it and bought a Garmin Nuvi 360. Very user freindly."
4,Great detail.,This is a great GPS. Menus are easy to read and access. Not as many Points of interest as I would like....
1,Extreme Disappointment,"I don't even know where to begin with how unsatisfied I was with this product. Gave it one week prior to returning it. Impossible to enter data- very small keys and hard to touch. Inaccurate directions, very slow, terrible speaker, etc. etc, etc. Steer clear of this GPS unit."
2,"Nice Stylish Unit, Too Slow Mount Breaks","Unit looks better than any other unit, however, navi is slow and sluggish, it is not sensitive to the touch at all, u have to use your nails or else you'll never get it. I find myself pressing buttons a couple of times before it process it.The free traffic is okay. I turned the device to not use tolls and U turns but it does it anyway. Whats that setting do if it does it anyway? It routes me the worst way possible for some trips.The mount is garbage, it breaks all the time, i'm on my 3rd one! Navigon keeps replacing it free though.It is a sleek stylish system with many features, reality view is okay but not always accurate."
2,"GPS works well, holder is a joke",This is my first GPS unit and I have really enjoyed having it. I really like the lane assist. I find it to be accurate. Its directions are 98% of the time the route I would have taken. 2% takes me on a scenic drive that I don't really understand why it thinks is faster. It functions great and is quick enough that I don't feel like I wait on it. My biggest complaint is the holder to attach the unit to the windshield. I read the reviews about it being loose and really tried to be careful with it. It became so loose in 4 months that I had to call and get a new one. They sent me a shipping label to return it and got a new one in under a week. Driving down the street the new holder just snapped and the GPS unit went flying to the ground. They can't seem to build a quality holder. I am looking into other options since it cost enough that throwing it away and starting over isn't an option.
4,Best I've used.,The 7100 looks good and has a great POI list. The software is a little slow but the text to speech and lane assist make it worth the slight delay. The windshield mount looks good but doesn't work as well as the Garmin mounts. I have used this in multiple states and it has very accurate map data.
3,Navigon 7100 GPS,"This products has a good display window which is easy to read. The volume is clear, but the pronouciation of the street names are not good. I was disappointed in the performance when it came to rerouting, which was very slow. Also the letters/numbers key pad was very small and when trying to input information often two letters/numbers would be pushed at once."
2,Clunky Product,"I would return this item if i dont loose any moneyits very clunky and and lacks user friendlinesscar suction stand/arm is very large and rediculous that it needs its own front seat :-)interface very difficult and confusingwhy did I buy it? well, a big mistake just by item descriptioni recommend the Garmin 650 or or any other garmin than this product"
4,"It's an AIRPLANE, silly!","We love this plush airplane - not sure why they called it a helicopter...It matches the bedding perfectly and is just so darn cute. Well made, good stitching, nice and soft. We're going to buy another one just to have a backup! :)"
5,Album of the Year. . .?,"Listening to this hits collection by Mr. Carter is astounding when one realizes just how much this young man has accomplished at his young age. After all, the extremely overrated Beatles hadn't done anything yet when they were Aaron's age. Aaron has turned the music world on its collective ear, providing a blast of melody, pop smarts, and fun to a genre that was overpowered by tuneless, witless no-talents like Radiohead, Coldplay, and Linkin Park.As long as Aaron Carter is making music, the world is safe for quality music. What's more important, though, is that the world is safe for fun."
1,Riding on the coattails of his older brothers success,"Seriously, if his older brother wasn't a Backstreet Boy, he wouldn't even have a record contract. Besides, who really wants to hear songs about spilling orange juice and beating Shaq? Stay away from this crap."
1,This stinks,he is such a loser and a wannabee he is not talented william hungs sounds good compared to him worse cd ever y dosent he give up
1,Very Very BAD,"Please there are people who would waste their time and energy buying this pathetic excuse for a CD? I thought I heard the worst with Hi-5 but this, there is no words to describe how crappy this record is. He can't sing and neither can his brother. PEOPLE SAVE YOUR EARS!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SAVE YOUR EARS!!!"
1,zero.,"This guy has a ""greatest hits"" collection? Damn what is this world coming to? This guy can't sing or write for the love of him and I wouldn't buy this album if someone paid me to. This guy needs to realize he's a waste of skin. What a waste of production time."
1,Corny...,Someone below said this albumn is not like the other albumns with only 1-2 good songs and they are right.. This albumn has none. Zero. Zip. Nada. If you are 12 and below you may like the songs on this CD.. It's too childish and silly for anyone older... This isn't music... this is kids sing-along songs... Aaron Carter must be embarrassed of this...
1,SUCKS!!!!!,"I don't know why anyone would like this kids music! it makes me wanna barf! he doesn't write his own music, he can't rap or sing and he can't play the guiter! he not even cute! he's just like any other pop sing out their. all the girls like his stupid music just because they think he's hot..well I don't! if your looking for some GOOD music, try led zeppline, aerosmith, or ac/dc!"
1,Hits?,This guy has no hits as he has no good songs or musical ability. He's a member of the film actors guild. Man this kid is getting ugly.
2,"Oh Aaron, lets hope ur funny!!","Well wot can we say? This album canot b described in one word. Its very mixed.To aaron - wen u rap we think: don't give up ur day job.wen u sing out of ur nose: Oh no, oh aaron.wen u sing i want candy: we know y we put up with ur album.We hope 4 more of candy.U must have a fab personality 4 hilary duff and lindsay lohan to put up with u!!"
2,"Not that good, but O.K","This cd is good plain ""good"". Now Aaron wouldn't be singing if it was not for his older brother, he wouldn't be making hits. Then again he made a hit for jimmy neutron and other kid movies. I can understand that girls like him just like Jesse McCartney. I don't understand why the girls would like a boy in a snap if he made a hit, to me is they think a handsome face and blonde hair is ""cute"", GROW UP!!! Looks aren't everything, you need talent too. To me Jesse is trying to be like this guy, thats why he's always whining in his songs. To me he's on the same note through the whole song. This guy is a discrace to younger singers and the music business. Also (for the guy's) if you buy a cd that has anything to do with only boy bands, put it in a bag and put a genade in there too. This is an opinion, there are more boy groups out there than girl groups. So if you want get this cd, who's stopping you."
1,Are you even joking?,"Ok, it's really hard to beleive that people would like this stuff. I could understand girls thinking he's cute, but would that mean that if Brad Pitt came out with a gospel album would it automatically be good. This guy gives white people a bad name. Please all you black people out there, DO NOT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY!!! Why do all the good singers die in plane crashes?"
1,WHAT!!!!!!!!,"How can a guy who sings like a girl and looks like a girl have most requested hits? All the songs on here stink!!! Wait a minute, hold up, he actually could have a most requested hits album. Yeah, a Most Requested Hits to never listen to! HA!!! If we want real rap then lets try Will Smith or somebody."
1,I'd rate it negative stars if I could,"Let me just say one thing: if you like this kind of music, you have no soul. Aaron Carter is a cocky and annoying little boy who has his head up his ass. Oh yeah, and he likes to hang around with Tommy Lee and he has both his nipples pierced (Aaron does). Great role model. *Gags*"
2,Emily of New Moon,"Love the series, great for a young girl to see, my girls loved it, they were a little confused at how it ended"
1,Disappointed,"Emily of New Moon is a complete disappointment. This is not recommended for family viewing. Occassionally there is a nice episode, but in general the series is dark and depressing. Topics covered include teenage sex, sex outside marriage, babies born out of wedlock, marital affairs, visions of spirits, praying to spirits, enchantments, fantacies, and etc. While it is true that Little House on the Prairie addressed some of these same topics, the perspective revealed that these were wrong and in the end the good guys triumphed. Not so in Emily of New Moon. I am usually quite careful before plunking down my money and wrongly assumed that the quality of the Anne of Green Gables trilogy and Road to Avonlee would be continued into Emily of New Moon. Emily of New Moon will not find a home in my library of treasured shows."
4,Good overview of a great career,"""Disco de Oro"", by Wilkins, is a package that includes a DVD with 16 videos, a documentary on the making of breakthrough track ""Margarita"", and a biographical short film. This alone is worth the price and a must for any fan that already has his 4-disc box set. For the unitiated, the 13 songs spanning 30 years and 5 new songs should be enough to hook the listener.This is one of the most passionate voices in modern latin romantic music. Clever, realistic and heartfelt lyrics, music that still sounds right for this times, and a charismatic performer in the tradition of argentinian rock-baladeer Sandro. Wilkins, el rockmántico...mixing rock ballads with caribbean sounds and rhythms; quite on a class by himself."
1,Not the right mirror,I have bought several of these over the past 6 months and have yet to get the right mirror..You will get a CIPA 27093 Buick Pontiac sedan OE Style Power Driver Mirror in a cipa 27326 box..I keep buying these and amazon keeps paying to send them back without ever fixing the problem.
2,Adaptation and acting well below par,"I'm a big fan of the Adam Dalgleish detective stories and recently purchased DVDs of the first three books in the series. ""Cover Her Face"" was bad and ""A Mind to Murder"" worse, so I had only slight hopes for ""Unnatural Causes"" and they were quickly dashed.Although the script adheres more closely to the original plot than in ""A Mind to Murder"" it suffers from an unsuccessful attempt to develop the relationship between Dalgleish and Deborah Riscoe. Roy Marsden falls flat as a romantic lead, Mel Martin bears little resemblance to the Deborah of the book, and there's no wonder sparks don't fly between them. And alas, the script writers fail to salvage their fiasco with a poorly staged storm rescue scene.Please read P. D. James's Adam Dalgleish novels if you want 5-star detective stories; don't judge them by the DVD adaptations!"
2,Mediocre effort to film a fine story,"The screenplay did not quickly identify the characters/relationships and was confusing for half the presentation. The audio (as with many DVD's from the Mystery Series) was poor, getting loud and then too soft to understand. Audio clarity was also poor making the ""English"" accents hard to understand. The last 10 minutes of screenplay was truly horrible in concept and technique. An implausible storm rescue scene that looked as if the technology used to film it was from the 1930's (or earlier). It also appeared as primarily a ""time filler"" for the DVD run time requirement. All in all a VERY mediocre effort for a fine novel's (novelist's?)plot."
3,the dead man in the boat without hands,"The movie is well acted, well scripted and effective.We believe the detective is trying to stop the blood from flowingand just gets there too late because the murdereris one of the least likely suspects to have the ability to pull off the crimes.I enjoyed this one more than most.The movie has that British quality of sort ofsuspended emotions with stifled rage flowing below the surface."
5,Excellent!!!,"This was the first of Grace Livingston Hill's books that I read, and I must confess that it's my favorite!! It's about a teenage girl who has gotten in with the *wrong crowd*; her father overhears two of her classmates discussing her on a train ride home, and this opens his eyes to much that was going on with her and his other children. So, he takes his family away to his old family home in Vermont to stay indefinitely. There are quite a few experiences, including the oldest daughter running away to elope with her *boyfriend*, and both of them nearly dying in a car accident. Even though it was written in the mid 1920's, it is still pertinent today!"
2,Average material.,This type of cover breaks after a short while. The used plastic is not so good.Buy the ruber one if you don't mind it getting stuck when inserting into pocket.
3,The Fourth War,"The best element of this movie is the vintage Porsche 356which Scheider's colonel character drives. Stanton's generalis totally miscast, but his acting is superb. What reallyirked me was the failure to set the scene to at least looksomething like Germany. Other than some snow and evergreens,it was obviously filmed in the states or maybe Canada. The roadsand building types are all wrong. Ignoring all the negatives,this movie is still quite entertaining. Stanton's charactersaved it."
2,Irritatingly contrived.,"If you are a cold war film buff then you might like this just to be a completist but for general viewing it stinks! Forget it! It is just too contrived both in terms if plot and action. The fight scene, for example. No one would be able to stand all those hits and still be able to fight and what was all that when Schneider floats under the ice and pops up ready to fight again. Some of what you show has to be at least a little believable. This isn't! It has a cold war theme but it is, just as another reviewer says, just a Rambo spin off."
5,I love Play!,"Play was one of my favorite groups since I was ten, and now I'm 15! Anna, Rosie, Anais, and Faye really rock! ""Whole Again"" is my favorite song, it's very catchy and telling them to make them whole again! Thanx for reading my reveiw!"
3,deja vou- the uk has heard these songs before,"the album is good, but as any english person out there knows, 'honey to the bee' was sung by our uk popstar billie piper. 'just a little' was sung by libertyx (our very own pop stars from the tv series) and 'whole again' was sung by the girls from liverpool, atomic kittern???? the album is good but for english fans its all covers, come on play create new songs!!!!!"
4,Great!,"If you're expecting the Disney sugar pop heard on their debut and 'Don't Stop The Music,' 'Replay' may leave you cold. But if you wanted meatier lyrics and a more rockin' sound from these sweet-voiced girls, then this is an album you have to have. The first single, ""I Must Not Chase The Boys,"" is one you may find familiar-it is the only Play song that truly broke through to American mainstream radio. Its sound is almost haunting; and the ending is stunning. You have to hear it to understand. ""Honey To The Bee"" is slightly soulful pop, very hooky and another good song here. A must-have for Play fans, unless you were a strict fan of their nitty-gritty sugar sound."
5,Catchy songs and good girls singers!!!,"I'd like this second work of Play!!! This album contains many catchy songs of pop music with good girls singers!!!! My favourite track is ""Just a Little"" (wow!)... before I known this song but I didn't know the singers.... ^_^I'd like ""Whole Again"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" too!!! They are very catchy songs, pleasant for listen and with an easy melody to remember!"
4,just a little tidbit of information....,Just to inform the listeners that Honey to the Bee is a remake of the original Honey to the B by Billie. Search and listen to it-you'll see what I mean.Not to diss on Play. I think they did a really good job remaking the song and they all have incredible voices. I was just kinda surprised they would remake a song that came out only a few years ago.
5,The best girls group!,"I love their music! From their first album to their second, and their third album these girls can sing! They have the best voices. I am such a big fan of Play! They can really sing and dance. Their music is the best I have heard in a long while. When I first picked up their Cd I became and instant fan! I have all their albums from their very first one! This CD rocks. EXCELLENT SONGS AND A EXCELLENT MUSIC! DIFFENTLY NUMBER ONE!"
5,Play's Replay CD,Hey all you play fans...I am a huge fan of the band play and i just wanted to let you all know that Replay CD is really good. I would recommend this CD to anyone b/c with this CD Play definetley grew up more and I love the songs soo much. If you don't have this CD yet I would definetley recommend this b/c i love it and the songs are great and even if you dont't like Play just give the CD a try and you'll get to know Play more...A play fan!!!!!!!!!
5,AWESOME!!!,"They have grown up soo much! Do you remember the annoying pre teens working with Dreamstreet? They were the 2 most horrible groups ever. Dreamstreet and aaron carter still are. But play has grown up. they have some bittersweet ballads, light rock and bubble-y pop. im not big on that kind of music, mostly because its filled with extremely uneducated ... *like britney and jessica* but these girls arent. i can fully say i love every song on this CD except for ""Hot"" and ""Honey to the Bee"". It's not expensive, and totally worth your buy. Check it out!"
3,Remake heaven!,"This isa very good cd from Play. They have beautiful voices and awesome talent. But I would've like to hear more originals...there are a ton of remakes on this cd. Too name a few Honey to the Bee, Just a Little(which was originally done 2 years ago by a group of Pop Idol-the British American Idol- rejects.),and Whole Again(which was a remake Atomic Kitten did...I dot know who made the original). But thats pretty much it...other than those things(there are more remakes) its a good cd."
3,its ok,play what a cd but still ant the best .come on on both cd they have songs that where made by other singers in ''replay'' they have 2 songs that arnt theres they need to have a cd with only there songs but still the cd was good i mean if ur into gurl bands
4,"Girl bands are for boys too, didn't you know? They have great voices, creative minds, good looks!","This is a great CD. The girls who sing and rock these songs are glamourous hotties, and they know how to make their songs great. In my opinion the two best songs are ""I Must Not Chase The Boys"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough."" Both are terrific in terms of tune, hard rock, and lyrics, as are quite a few others on this very well put together CD. I think anyone who likes to hear beautiful young women sing should buy this. It is well worth everything it'll cost you."
2,any credibility?,"No, no, no......how can this manufactured girl-group be taken seriously when their second release is filled up of mainly covers of other popular artists. And theyre not songs that fell into oblivion either, all these covers have had moderate to very successful single life.First off the bat is 'Honey To The Bee' which was originally done by a British artist Billie Piper.Next is the brilliant 'Just A Little' which the group have slaughtered by the UK Popstars runners-up Liberty X.Moving along is the huge Atomic Kitten track 'Whole Again' which they've just tried to copy exactly.....Yet another cover in 'What Is Love' and finally the album closes with 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'.Now how can anyone take that seriously? Let's find some actual talent with some new original material!"
2,Oh please don't REPLAY this c.d!!!!!,This is Play's desparate attempt to go goth! It seriously dosen't make any sense to me why people buy c.d's like this! Their voices are covered up with effects and their music has no unique flavor! What sets them apart from Jump5? Huh!
1,Oh my God!,"I can't believe how many u.k covers they have on the album!!!Whole Again by Atomic Kitten (and even changed the chrous lyrics!,why?)Just A Little by Liberty X & Honey to the bee by Billie Pipper.Thats more covers per album than Westlife!I had to give this one star, as amazon will not let you put none!!!"
2,Boring.. and not that great..,"Well, it does have it's high points, but after listening to this CD, I was not very impressed. The vocals are very out of tune in places.. Also, I was not impressed at all with their version of ""Whole Again."" It was originally done by the UK group Atomic Kitten.. if you want to hear a good version of it (without some very cheesy lyrics.. Play changed some for whatever reason..) listen to Atomic Kittens original version. Also, they butchered ""Just a little"" which was done by Liberty X another group from the UK.. Trying to take hit songs from across the pond and pass them off as their own? Not going to work.. definitly not as good as the originals.. The whole album didn't impress me at all."
1,Not Good,"Play is nothing but a bunch of little girls trying to sing. All covers: Honey To The Bee, Whole Again, Just A Little are very bad. The originals are so much better. Their own songs aren't that good either. This album is a major disappoiting. They give Swedish artists a bad name!"
5,I must not chace the boys,i must not chace the boys is the best song that ever lived it makes you want to get up and dance
5,great stuff,"Great stuff. Had to mend the dogs head after he bolted after surgery and blew some stitches.It worked great to fix it, Vet didn't even notice it. His were massive next to mine. This is one time were bigger wasn't better! Worked brilliantly!!!"
4,RnB,I REALLY LIKE RNB MUSIC IT RELAX YOUR MIND IT PUT ME TO SLEEPIT HAVE U THINK ABOUT SOME STUFF IT WILL PUT STUFF ON YOUR MIND TO THINK ABOUT.I LIKE LISTEN TO THAT THEN ANY OTHER TYPE OF MUSIC. BUT I THINK IT WILL SELL BETTER THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF MUSIC.EVERYBODY LIKES TO LISTEN TO SLOW MUSIC. WELL THAT ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT RnB MUSIC. IT A GOOD TYPE OF MUSIC
2,"Interesting, but...","Cooper's test is fascinating and extensive. Unfortunately the reproduction of the photographs is TERRIBLE! At least this is true of the paperback edition and mine was sold as and seemed new. If you must have it, buy the cheapest used copy you can find. A big disappointment."
2,this book was o.k.,I think it could have been better prepared. I thought it could have been better edtied
4,44 potential framed posters for the right rocker,"""Zuke - Visual Thrills Vol.1"" has, as advertised, 44 posters and paintings primarily advertising Austin concerts by such musical luminaries as the Butch Hancock Band, Joe Ely, the Talking Heads, etc. and classic venues such as Raul's and the Armadillo. About 11 pages are in color, but all posters are well produced and interesting. While the book is not huge (maybe 8x14) the posters could be very amusing if they were matted and framed. Guy Zuke (the artist) has a stylistic range between the Furry Freak Brothers and detailed line drawings."
4,An enjoyable read.,"Babel is a great model for new writers in his ability to place ""life on the page."" This translation is as complete as they come and well translated for the contemporary American ear."
3,Music for your pimpmobile!,"Play this in your 1976 Thunderbird, wear a suede fedora with a great big feather in it, a white leisure suit and put the seat 'way back so that you can drive straight-armed and ENJOY! Lenny White is a serious drummer and his chops are indisputable. But I just stuck my vinyl version of this on the turntable and so much of it told me why 70's music is lamentable. However, I would encourage you to buy it for the cut ""Sweet Dreamer"" which is worth 5 stars in and of itself. I wish Lenny had more of this tune in him and less a desire to show that he could pound away more fast and furious than other fusion drummers of his time. A perfect time warp piece."
5,Delightful and Fun,"As a professional in the culinary world with an interest in healthy Greek food, I really enjoyed this video. I enjoyed learning about the local herbs and the regional dishes. The program is romantic with authentic music, delectable food and beautiful scenery. The host, Cynthia, is a delight and I felt like I was right there in Greece! I have been inspired to get married in Greece September 2008!!"
4,Romantic Destination,"If you're thinking about a trip to greece or just want an ""in home getaway"" this is the video for you. Lovely photography of scenic ocean views and you get the flavor and taste of Santorini all in one video.The color and layout was fabulous and I just loved Cynthia's enthusiasm for Greek cooking. It truly looks like a place I'd love to visit and the ""modern day godess"" showed me where to go. Santorini is on my list!"
4,Fun little bit of old-school sci-fi,It's good to see this underlooked gem is back in print. My old copy has been reread enough times that it's falling apart. Hopefully a new generation of readers will appreciate a good old-fashioned tale of pioneering the last new frontier. Bubb's away!
5,CD reveiw,English and spanish versions make bilingual learning fun. Our 2 year old likes the catchy rhythms to dance and learn to sing along with.
4,Overpriced but useful,"I'm doing research about Napoleon and needed this book. The book itself was very useful to me, but as an out of copyright print-on-demand paperback it seemed overpriced."
2,There has to be a better exercise DVD than this,"I bought this DVD because my husband and I are exercise fanatics. When I became pregnant I wanted to continue my workouts but was unsure how much exercising I could safely maintain. I also wanted new exercises that I could substitute for the things I would have to discontinue as my pregnancy progressed. This video didn't answer those questions. I would say if you are just beginning an exercise routine during pregnancy this might hold your attention. The exercises are very, very basic. If you describe yourself as a health club regular you will be bored to tears and find these exercises simplistic and crave something more challenging."
3,Close up of the South in midst of Civil War,"Frederick Law Olmsted was a journalist and military medic before he became famous as the co-architect of Central Park. This edition of his Southern Travel report could do with some editing and format improvements. It is one dense page after another with no introductory or interpretive material. But as a first hand report of the slave economy during the Confederacy it is superb, just difficult to get through."
2,Don't stay on,"These are very cute slippers, and they seem nice and warm. Unfortunately, my 4-month-old kicks them off in under 10 seconds, so they're useless. I recommend the fleece toggle booties by the same company if your baby is good at taking off shoes and socks."
4,Could be a little better,These are nice soft booties. My only issue is that they dont really stay on that well.
4,Mostly wonderful poems,"Jack Gilbert is an excellent poet. Like all books of poetry, this volume has many wonderful poems and a few clunkers. Sometimes his poem endings are a wonderful surprise or a shock which is the mark of a excellent craftsman which he certainly is. That said,a few poems in the volume shoot themselves in the foot with contrived endings. Definitely recommended."
2,"Amazing poetry, horrible Kindle formatting","I already own a physical copy of this book. I wanted a digital edition for my Kindle and I bought one. What garbage, the formatting on the Kindle is done with such thoughtlessness and disregard that it should never have been released at all. I don't want to rate this 2 stars, the poetry deserves 5. Of course on Kindle you can't return anything you buy either, despite DRM preventing any illegal copying. Buy the physical book, but stay away from the Kindle edition."
2,Save your money!!!,"If you purchased the S1 DVD set, don't purchase this DVD. This episode is already on the S1 Set(which I own - that's how I know). I had this DVD on my wish list and a dear friend purchased it for me. The reason I had it on is because I was hoping it would be the pilot version WITHOUT Melissa ""Suki"" McCarthy. She was not who was originally chosen to play ""Suki"". I really wanted to see the dynamic between ""Lorelai"" and ""Suki"" before Melissa stepped in. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Melissa's ""Suki"".It's not a bad thing to purchase if you've NEVER seen ""Gilmore Girls"" and you don't want to shell out for an entire season. The Pilot eps is what hooked me on the show. It's witty, sarcastic (but in a good way) and down right fun and enjoyable to watch. Sure beats the heck out of all the ""reality"" shows on now.Just my $.02 worth."
5,Great pilot episode.,"This dvd is just a promotion idea to get people interested in the series. They sell first episode DVD's like this in stores all the time. They figure people will be more likely to put down $55 on a set of DVD's if they knew what they were getting.Anyways the pilot on the show was great, and this DVD is very unnecessary if you already like the show. But, if you have never seen an episode and you just want to give it a try then this is something that you should check out.I have never bought one of these first episode disks but i have seen some in Best Buy, and I believe you will actually get a coupon or something for $5 off the first season set."
4,Ich finde es super,Es hat sich für mich gelohnt alles über die gilmore girls zu kaufen. ich kann es nur weiter empfelen!!
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","It's limited in it's scope of items that are covered. It's more of a ""how-to"" in regards to doing bolt on upgrades for certain components, as opposed to doing any actual tuning of the bike. I was hoping for more of a tuning manual, suspension and engine."
5,I would have paid $100 for this.,"I have noisy neighbors who occasionally like to party in close proximity to my bedroom window. My bedroom is where I both sleep and study. As a biochemistry student, I really need to concentrate, and I didn't feel like listening to my neighbors loud, screaming laughter on Saturday afternoons when I'm trying to do equations.Additionally, my neighbors have shrieking children (and I mean, we sound like we're on fire shrieking) who would wake me up every morning at 9am without fail.They all might have moved for all I know. I can't hear a thing since I bought this contraption. Best money I ever spent."
5,Best money I ever spent!!!,After years of having trouble shutting my brain off this machine does the trick.....No more noises from the house creaking etc. Great product and worth every penny I spent.
3,"Good white noise, but not much different from my bedside fan","For years, I've used a fan for white noise to assist me with sleeping through the night. I'm fairly sensitive to noise while sleeping, so if a car drives by outside, or if somebody is still awake in the house making noise, it will generally wake me up. Therefore, the fan has been great for providing a soothing, drowning noise to sleep to. However, when I heard about this device, I eagerly ordered it, and couldn't wait to use it.So far, it has done nothing for me that the $5 fan has not... the tone is remarkably similar. I have tried adjusting the settings, and putting the Marpac in various places in the bedroom, to see if the experience would improve. So far, it has not done anything spectacular, but I'll continue to use it for another week or two, to see if it actually provides a better white noise sleeping experience (for me, at least)."
4,"Compact, works well, & easy to travel with","After many years of using a fan to create white noise, we found this sound machine. It's got varied settings so you can control sound and compact so it's easy to travel with. Highly recommend for white noise."
4,Very white noise,"This thing is like having a big fan, without having the big fan. Drowns out alot of loud kids when the baby is trying to catch up some naptime."
5,Great product!,"My husband and I are both thrilled with this product. He has to get up early for work and sometimes has trouble sleeping at night due to the normal night sounds (creaking stairs,etc.) as well as two teenagers who don't go to bed that early. This machine has made it possible for him to sleep without being disturbed by these noises. I too have found it very restful and look forward to turning it on each night. We should have bought it years ago!"
2,"Good Idea, just NOT LOUD ENOUGH","The Dohm is a great small size and a neat design with the fan. The dual speed has a bit of sound range, but it's just not loud enough to really drown out other sounds four our little baby girl. We had a Brookstone Tranquil Moments sound machine that broke on us - we were hoping to pay a bit less money and get a nice replacement. This just doesn't have the volume, even though we wanted to like it. Poor baby didn't approve. Not sure where to go from here, the Brookstone is expensive and I fear it's just going to break again. I think the A/C power supply cord/connection is a poor design...."
4,Good buy,"Did not take the two weeks recommended to get used to it: It worked right away. Drowns out almost all outside noises, two pleasing settings, though I like the louder one. Compact, fits anywhere."
3,It is OK,"fast delivery. good quality. But it is not that powerful, it can block the talking sound from outside of the apartment but cannot block the sound from inside.I can still hear the click of the clock, the snoring from my husband, the steps from upstairs. it helps me a bit, the lower pitch works cool, the higher pitch is annoying."
4,Apartment living is noisy.,"I read the reviews of this product, and I ordered this product being unsure of what it would do.I have to say, it's a product that does exactly what it says it will do. It creates white noise at varying levels.There is no miracle product that is going to mask all sounds of people upstairs walking around. The noise would have to be jackhammer-like for that to work, which would cause its own problems. This product cannot wipe away all the pitfalls of apartment living. It is not advertised as a ""miracle-in-a-box.""It is a white noise machine, and as such, it seems a high quality one with varying levels of control. I'm happy with the purchase. I do think $50 is a bit pricey, but it doesn't have much of a mechanical sound, and I think cheaper ones might have grating motors that would be annoying and hard to ignore.I can still hear my neighbor walking around upstairs. But it does mask out reasonable music noise, TV noise, and talking noise."
4,Excellent product,"Excellent white noise produced - our baby and preschooler both sleep much better now that they have these in their rooms. The look of the product is not intrusive either, and the settings are sensible and easy to use.My only complaint is that our first machine developed a rattle on the high volume setting, a few months after purchase. The company replaced it free of charge but we did have to pay to ship it back and it has taken them a few weeks to send a replacement, which is not ideal."
2,Not loud enough!,"The sound if very soft and is nice to fall asleep to, but it is DEFINITELY not loud enough to drown out any sort of noise, especially if you are light sleeper. Too bad it's too quiet...it would make a much better product if you could just turn it up!"
5,Love the white noise !,This product is amazing and professional. It is the very same gadget used in banks and medical offices. There is adjustable white noise via the switch and rotation of the vent. It is easy to operate. The cord is shorter than what I expected and it does not run on batteries but overall I LOVE this white noise generator and cannot sleep without it. It is useful when traveling as hotels are noisy and this is light weight and easy to pack. I highly recommed this for anyone in need of a good sound sleep atmosphere void of dogs barking and neighboring walls echoing with tv volume.
2,worthless,"No variation in the sound, only the volume, and it's in no way a pleasant sound. Not the way to block out urban noise."
4,Nice,"I bought this in Australia so I paid $90 because I needed the product quickly. Having said that, even $45 is overpriced for a fan. Hence I take off one star.But ... I don't care, it works quite well for me. I moved to an old timber house on a busy street. I was a heavy earplug user. Then later on I developed a middle ear infection and started to experience vertigo and dizziness - perhaps due to the earplugs? As I lay in a hospital in the emergency department for dizziness I fell asleep to the sounds of continuous chatter. I then realised that it's the intermittent noises that annoy me.Enter this white noise machine. It doesn't mask sounds completely, but it does divert your focus away from them. I now sleep well with this machine without earplugs. The adjustable tone is nice, because I can't sleep with my air purifier which has a different tone, but I can sleep with this because I set the tone down to really low."
2,You can do better,"As a disclaimer, falling asleep is only rarely a problem for me. As a result, I owned the SleepMate for quite some time before needing it. The good news is that, yes, it does produce a fan sound that can lull you to sleep. But please consider that the unit is much louder than it needs to be, even on its lowest setting. So loud, in fact, that the instructions say to locate the SleepMate away from your bed. If you do that, you'll find yourself having to get up in order to turn it on -- not good at all if you only want sporadic use. Second, and I realized this way too late, there are far better ways to accomplish the same goal. My son downloaded sleep sounds onto his iPod Touch. He has a whole variety of pleasant sounds, crickets, wind, ocean, etc (for free), where the SleepMate only makes the sound of a fan."
3,Similar sound to an air purifier,"I bought this product for my baby since babies love and sleep better with white noise. I was not sure what kind of sound it would produce. However, I discovered that this sound conditioner makes a very similar sound to my air purifier. Save your money if you have an air conditioner or air purifier in your room."
1,too quiet,"This is way too quiet, even in the loudest mode it does not drown out regular household noises (ie. tv in the other room or footsteps in the hallway). It really isn't much louder than a small fan, available for $10. We got the Conair sound therapy / clock for $19.99 and are happy that this is much louder."
2,Way To Noisy,"I bought this hoping to provide some white noise against traffic sounds. However, it is way to noisy even at the lowest setting. My Austin Air Healthmate air purifiers provide a much gentler sound. I returned these for a refund as they are useless to me."
2,Not loud enough.,I bought this for our baby's nursery. It's just not loud enough. I then purchased the more expensive Marsona DS-600A and I love it. The volume adjusts from very quiet to very loud.
5,not just a white noise,"I bought this for my young son so he can't hear us around the house. It works great, he loves it. We even use it ""to scare away monsters.""Worth the money in my opinion!"
3,Thought it'd be louder,"So, we bought this for our little one, to aid him in falling asleep. We got it off our baby registry, as I knew the power of white noise during the ""fourth"" trimester. I liked that it was dual speeds, but when I got it and used it for the first time, I was surprised how low the ""high"" setting sounded. I feel like our fans did a better job. Oh, and at the beginning, it gave off a really weird odor. I felt uncomfortable using it around our day-old baby, so we had to use it when the baby wasn't around (defeating the purpose) until I was sure the smell was gone. We still use it nightly, in conjunction with our space heater and humidifier. Between the three electronics, it's like we're in an airport, and it seems to work. :)"
1,just turn a box fan on low and there you have the sound this machine makes.,"i really was hoping this would replace the box fan in my infants room, especially since it's getting cooler out. NO NO NO! if you have been using a box fan to drown out noise, keep using it and skip this. i was really expecting more, but i would compare the sound this makes to a box fan on the LOWEST setting. this is with the marpac on as high as it would go, too..it just doesn't do what i need it to. sending it back. disappointed."
3,"I wanted this for the longest time, BUT...",".... then I realized I had already been using a similar device that I had in my home - a fan! That's right, after months of using a fan pointed toward the wall (because I didn't want to get too cold at night), I realized it was all I needed! So, save your $ and use the electric fan you already own!!!"
1,sound screen review,"hm. what to say about the sound screen---it wasnt helpful to us at all. it's a great idea--perhaps we've spent too many nights on overseas flights. it sounded like being inside an airplane cabin. and if that is useful to your sleep, then you'll like this machine."
5,THE DOPE,"GREAT PRODUCT ! I BOUGHT TWO. SOUNDS SOME WHAT LKE IN WINDOW A/C BUT MUCH CHEAPER ! MY WIFE AND I ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO WORK NIGHTS. THE DOPE UPSTAIRS DONT WAKE US UP ANY MORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOD BLESS YOU, MARPAC,BRUCE AND PATTI"
3,I had the wrong expectation,"I was expecting this to be louder with the ability to really drown out sounds, it did not. It slightly muffled them.So I cannot say it is a bad product because I am sure for some it will be fine, but I had the expectation of it having the ability to drown out all noises and that was not the case.I could still hear my son's baby sister crying over it as well as my husband walking down our creaky stairs."
1,"Yes, it does drown out some noises but...","it's so loud it is annoying in and of itself. Obviously it works for some, doesn't work for me or my DW."
2,Effective white noise but has metallic clicking/rattling,"This product does create white noise but it has a metallic clicking and rattling, rendering the product useless."
1,Very disappointed!,"I own a condo and unfortunately some young renters moved in above me and they are obnoxiously loud at all hours. They act like they live in a dorm! I was hoping this item would help to drown out some of the noise, but it doesn't at all. It just sounds like a box fan turned on low even with all the holes opened up on it. I actually bought a Homedics Nature Sound Machine with volume control that works 10x better than this thing! I need to return this because it's not worth the $50 and change. I am very dissapointed because it got such good reviews. It doesn't drown out anything. I had it on high and I heard a truck drive by and the sound was the same as if it was turned off. I really can't think of who would benefit from this thing! It's definitely not good for apartment or condo living that's for sure!"
2,No Better Than a Fan,"I'm surprised by the ratings given to this product. I have a vornado fan and it does a good, if not better, job drowning out noise at a fraction of the cost. If you are looking to drown out low frequency noise or hard-soled shoes on wood floors, you will be very disappointed in this product. Note: To be fair, the Vornado fan isn't any better at drowning out these sounds either. I really wanted to say good things about this product, but it looks like my neighbors have won the battle."
2,Not as loud as some of these reviewers would lead you to believe,"I bought this machine after reading the first review on the page. The reviewer wrote about how this machine masked the sounds of his noisy neighbors, but after owning this thing for a few days I just don't believe it. This sound conditioner works okay, but I was expecting something much louder. I've tried all the settings, but it just isn't loud enough. I've never returned anything to Amazon, but I need to exchange this for something louder."
3,Noise Problems,"This machine is pretty good for the sounds taking place outside but does not help for noise overhead, like footsteps. I am somewhat pleased with the purchase.."
2,Good... for a time,"I have had this product for a little over a year now and it worked great for the first 11 1/2 months or so. I noticed after about 11 months that the sound emitted from the machine was becoming more and more inconsistent. Sometimes it would be loud while other times it would be a much softer sound even when using the loudest setting. It got to the point where over time the sound would actually just fade away to being completely silent over the course of the night.A few days after a full year of having the product the machine just stopped working all together. I tried using a different outlets in the room and even in other houses all to no avail. The product literally does nothing when I plug it in and turn on the switch. Best part is that the warranty for it is only for a year so I'm stuck with a $50 paper weight now.The first 11 months of owning this I would have given it a 5/5, but I would prefer for it to have more longevity if I'm going to spend $50+ on it."
3,Not relaxing,"Sorry folks, I read all of the positive reviews and this seemed like a dream (literally). My husband wakes up very early and often wakes me up (and I can't fall back asleep because I start hearing all the creepy sounds in an empty house). But, I found it to be extremely loud (my husband put a pillow over his head), even after closing down the vents (to muffle it). So loud that I can't imagine falling asleep in it's presence. I also thought it wasn't a very ""relaxing"" sound. I returned it and pulled out my old oscillating fan and put it by my bedside pointed away from me. I keep it on ""high"" and it has been amazing. Very relaxing, breezy summer afternoon type sound (even in the winter). I wish I had thought of it sooner, I'm not waking up anymore when my husband leaves."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I bought this machine because my housemates wake up earlier than I, and I live right off the kitchen. When they would make noise in the kitchen, I would always wake up and not be able to go back to sleep.The machine isn't perfect. It doesn't block out everything. But I often sleep through the morning. Sometimes my housemates still wake me, but I am able to go back to bed with no problem. I recommend this machine if you are having problems waking up in the night or the mornings."
5,White noise sleep machine,Good product. Better than running the bathroom fans to cover noise from guest movements or when one spouse or the other is up and getting ready for work so the other can sleep.
5,Great product - really helped sleep,"I have found it very helpful! My sleep has improved dramatically. Took it on a trip and stayed in a hotel and it even worked there! Awesome product overall, would highly recommend."
5,Can't live without it,This is the second one that we have purchased. The first one was about 15 years ago and it is still running strong. We wanted a second one for the spare bedroom and take with us on vacations. We use it every night for a great nights sleep.
3,It needs a lower speed,I would not purchase this again.It needs a lower speed.If my husband hadnt thrown the box away I would have sent back
4,White noise machine,"I've been using this product for about a month now. It is very loud, so I put it in my in-suite bathroom. The door blocking most of the noise (on the quietest setting) is a tolerable level so I can sleep. It covers up bass noises the best. It does help block out noise so I can sleep. The unit is unattractive and the cord is ridiculously long."
4,Great Product,"It is everything they say it is. It sounds like blowing air. If you are using this for a baby, it can be very loud on a baby monitor."
5,replaced a rattle trap fan,"My Marpac replaced a fan that was gradually falling apart. The Marpac looks better and sounds better. My first choice would have been a sound machine I purchased years ago from the Museum of Modern Art, but that machine faded away and I haven't been able to find another like it. Now, after having my Marpac for several weeks, I'm not so sure I wouldn't choose it over the MOMA machine."
3,Not Loud Enough!!!!,If you live in NYC you would need at least two of these to block out the noise. My air conditioner which is not very loud does a better job of blocking out noise than this does.
5,Marpac Sound Soother,Bought this for my daughter after she saw it in her pediatrician's office.She loves it!
3,Not what I expected,"This unit has great reviews from others - but I returned the one I received. It just wasn't exactly what I had expected. It's just a fan in a round box and it didn't really change tone or volume at all when the vents turned. I have tinnitus, and am always searching for something that will help mask the sound at night. This unit, unfortunately, just didn't do it for me."
3,For the price I expected more.,"I expected more for the price. More white noise. It does about as much masking as a fan but without blowing air around. I still run the AC fan for noise and it's about as loud as that. I would have returned it but with the restocking fee, return shipping, and insurance it wasn't worth the trouble. Try some noisy fans at the store. They're easier to return."
3,Good soothing sound machine.,"My sister has recommended this sound machine to me on amazon.com because of the positive reviews and im usually a very light sleeper who needs some sort of soothing sounds to sleep without dead silence. I have been using an old fan for sounds for a long time even during the winter and I found one of these products at the mori luggage store at my mall and I bought it there instead of amazon.com.All I can say is that this machine has a great soothing sound that's way better then using a fan to improvise for soothing sound for sleeping. But it certainly does not block any sort of outside unwanted noise but I still would recommend this to anyone like me who can't sleep with dead silence, it's a pretty good machine but just don't expect it to block any sort of unwanted noise outside of your room and right now im using mine on dual speed which is more soothing.VERDICT:3 stars for the soothing soundAnd 2 stars taken away for the gimmicky unwanted noise it's suppose to block."
4,"If you like white noise, you wil love this device","I grew up falling asleep to the sound of a fan. I used to use a fan throughout the year. There is just something soothing about constant background noise. I grew up in a very quiet neighborhood that was almost too quiet and I needed help falling asleep. In college it was too loud so I used a fan during that part of my life to fall asleep. I have tried other devices that make sounds of crickets, thunderstorms and other sounds of nature, but nothing comes close to the Marpac 980. We now have two small children and we use two Sleepmates and we are about to purchase a third one. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys masking inconsistent background noise or lack thereof"
3,White Noise should give you ONLY that,"I have used a white noise machine for about thirty years. I can't sleep without one because any little out-of-the-ordinary sound wakes me up. My old Marpac started making little clinky sounds (but, after all, it was ten years old) so I decided to buy a new one. Unfortunately, the new one makes ""little clinky sounds,"" too, and it is brand new. I bought a new machine to get pure white noise--but that isn't what I got. I have to rest the machine at an angle next to my end table to get the extraneous sound to disappear. Another testimony to ""They don't make 'em like they used to."""
4,Sleeping better,"After recently getting a place in a high rise in the city, we found sleep was often difficult at night because of noise from bistros at street level late at night and then again very early in the mornings with the noise from bus service (which began before 6 AM). I purchased this unit from Amazon after several people recommended white noise generating devices. We never had one before, but found the Marpac 980A to be very easy to use and found it worked surprisingly well. The noise it emits is not terribly distracting. The device has adjustments for how loud and at what pitch you prefer the sound. We found it was easy to get used to the sound. I'm very pleased with the effectiveness of the unit. I just wish it looked more like something in my decor and less like something out of a hospital equipment catalog!"
4,Sleepmate is worth it,I bought the sleepmate for my youngest daughter due to her older sister has to get up before her and makes noise as she moves around the house and there is much construction in the neighborhood due we are living in a new development. She loves her sleepmate and has actually stated she sleeps better with it on and it reduces all the annoying noise.
5,Better Than a Fan,"I've used an older version of this machine for years and love it. I recently started babysitting my grandson, and it has helped him take longer, sounder naps. He doesn't hear the phone ring, the dog bark, or the doorbell sound. I'll be babysitting a new grand-baby, in addition to my grandson, so I recently purchased a new one for where the new baby will sleep. For those light sleepers, it's the best."
2,Not this one,"The product's noise was very artificial and it was louder than the outside noise. We couldn't sleep with it. If you buy it through whitenoise-us and have to return it, your ""free shipping"" will get substracted from your refund amount."
5,Cheaper than dual paned windows,"This is wonderful - no more putting a floor fan on to stop the noise of yapping dogs or coyotes, gardeners blowing leaves or lawnmowers. The constant background noise is adjustable, making it easy to tune it up or down to suit your needs. We have tried other digital sound machines and they were terrible. This is wonderful wonderful wonderful!"
4,It's decent,"I just received this yesterday. My husband ordered it for me, because his snoring has gotten out of control and I've developed a sleeping problem because of it, and I also have tinnitus which doesn't allow me to concentrate on anything except the vibrations in my ear. I used it last night for the first time. I set it up right beside my head, to try and drown out some of his nightly tunes. It wasn't as loud as I thought it would be. It didn't help me GET to sleep any faster, but once I got to sleep, I didn't wake up and have to kick him in the shins...again. It doesn't drown out the snoring completely...but it does help a little. It did help with my tinnitis....having a background noise completely took away the vibrations in my ear, and i didn't hear a thing. This thing is wonderful for tinnitus, and decent for snoring....I did notice that my daughter's late night TV watching didn't bother me as much either. I think its a good product!"
5,Wonderful Product,This is the second sound machine just like this I have purchased. It works wonderful for my baby (who can't hear the dog barking from her room any longer) and for my husband who works nights. (Who also can't hear the dog!) I highly recommend this. I got the 980A and it is wonderful.
1,Completely useless,"I was hoping to use this machine to drown out people talking 10 feet away from my desk, but sadly it had no impact whatsoever."
2,New models suffer from high pitched whinning noise,"This is my third Marpac machine, and Ilike them,but this latest model suffers from a high pitched whezzing sound that would besure to keep my awake"
5,Love it! And sleep so well!,"I purchased this over a year ago. I had been wearing ear-plugs for the last few years and wanted to go without sticking something in my ears each night... yuck! It took me awhile to get going with the sound conditioner. It seemed too loud and I couldn't sleep. I started with it on low, actually right outside my room. I slowly moved it closer, over a few weeks. Now I have it by my bed on high every night. I sleep so soundly. And those who aren't super sensitive sleep right through it on night one - my niece came to stay and fell asleep with it right beside her."
3,"Works as promised, but too quiet","The hum of this sound conditioner is mild and unobtrusive, though i certainly wouldn't characterize it as ""soothing"". My problem is that the higher volume is still too quiet- if having this machine on solves your noise problems, i envy your situation."
5,WORKS LIKE A CHARM,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift and the person who recieved the gift wrote to thank me and said it worked great! The true test was on New Years eve, when fireworks were exploding near by and they put the unit near the baby and the baby slept thru the firework noise!"
5,First impression,I just got this thing. The white noise it produces is excellent. 5 stars based off my first impression. Assuming that this actually lasts for years as the product description said then Ill be really happy.
5,Does the job.,"The Marpac 980A generates a steady white noise that successfully masks ambient noise. I am a light sleeper and am easily disturbed by noise from the street and from interior sounds generated by various appliances and electronic devices in my home. The Marpac help me get a good night's sleep. It is easy to operate and to adjust the intensity of the sound. My only complaint is in their product identification. It took me a lot of research, including going to their website to figure out that the same product has different names. Don't know why they do this. Use the model number."
5,I've been converted....,"I bought this when I started dating my boyfriend, who always slept with a giant box fan at his own place. At my place he was having trouble sleeping without the fan sound. Being short on space as it is, I didn't want to deal with a giant fan collecting dust in my bedroom, so I went online and found this little gem. Once I got used to having it on, I became unable to sleep without it even when he wasn't around! I never realized how easily I can be woken up and I don't exactly live in a quiet neighborhood. When his fan broke down I brought it there with me one night and forgot to take it home. Torture! So now we both have one and we both sleep happy :)"
3,Pretty good,"This white noise machine works as advertised , but it isn't as loud as I thought it would be . When I sleep , I have it right near my head , so it drowns out almost everything . If you can't put it right near your bed , you may want to look for another option ."
4,Very helpful,"Our children (ages 2 and 1) are very light sleepers. While on a trip my friend had this in the guest bedroom. I was able to talk on the phone in the same room as my sleeping 1 year old! Crazy. That sold me on it. Once we got home, I ordered it right away. The night waking has diminished. :-) Worth the money for us."
4,Great sound machine,This is an excellent machine. I have one in each of my children's rooms and mine. It blocks out all outside noise. Easy to travel with as well and bring to hotels with you.
5,Works as advertised,"My husband and I sleep with a pedestal fan on every night, just for the noise. We bought this unit for travelling, as a properly sized fan doesn't fit in our luggage, and little fans tend to buzz and vibrate erratically. Two weeks ago, the Marpac got its first test. Nice hotel, climate system completely silent, next to an interstate, with an airport across the interstate. We found the sound from this unit higher-pitched and a bit louder than our fan, but it screened out other noise well, and we got two decent nights' sleep."
4,Very good at cancelling out certain noises,Where this unit excels is cancelling out loud and persistent sounds. For instance if you live near a highway and have traffic going by at all hours this would cancel that out perfectly. If you have a noisy window unit that bothers you this unit will overpower the noise of the window unit with a more pleasant sound.However if the noise that bothers you is something like neighbors slamming cabinets or talking loudly then its simply not going to cover all that noise. It may help draw your attention from outside sounds and focus on the sound the unit makes which can be a positive but its not going to drown out all the sound from neighbors unless its barely audible to begin with.If I had thin walls though I would still buy one even if it doesnt drown out all the noise. It gives you a nice sound to focus on rather than being forced to focus on whatever is happening on the other side of the wall.
3,simple,"Simple to use but only has one sound and no clock. Kind of sounds like muffled white noise. we have two others that have other sound options which are nice when you get sick of the ""white noise."""
4,Works great!,It's everything I expected it to be from reading other reviews before buying it.One complain is that it's too loud to put in the same room for our 15 months old toddler. She scares its noise. I have to put ot outside her room.
3,Too Quiet,"I bought this to help drown out the sound of my young cat playing around my bedroom early in the morning (I'm a light sleeper).This has 2 settings, the loudest of which was NOT very loud at all. It sounded like a light fan on the very lowest setting. If you are looking for something that has soothing, comforting sound, this might be for you... But if you are in need of white noise to cover up house sounds and sleep better, this is WAY too quiet. I sent it back and just use my fan now, which is much louder that this."
1,Electronic buzzing and rattling,"Useless. Sure it creates white noise but for those who are very sensitive to sound, it also creates a high pitch buzzing ""electronic"" sound. And every once it a while there is a sound as if there is a tiny rock being tossed around...almost like that sound old electric coil heaters make when they're warming up."
2,Too LOUD,"The machine makes a nice white noise sound which is adjustabel in ""tone"", but not volume. I found it much too loud for our bedroom. So loud that it kept us awake. If you are looking for a soft background noise machine do not buy this."
1,Not loud enough!!!,"I bought this machine after reading all the positive reviews here on amazon. My fiance uses a boxed fan to drown out the noise in our room, but I think it's ugly, so I wanted to get something more effective and compact. This ""sound conditioner"" doesn't even reach the sound level of his fan on its lowest level. It's not loud enough to block out sounds from outside the house, much less the louder ones from the inside. I also bought a lifesounds by marpac for my 9yo, and the volume on it is really really great. It gets extremely loud at the highest volume, and also has other sounds besides the white noise like surf, rain, brook, womb, heartbeat and lullaby (it actually doesn't have the straight white noise setting, but surf sounds quite like it). I will be returning the marpac sleepmate for the lifesounds for our room too (hopefully...haven't looked at return policy on amazon yet)."
1,too quiet,"It sounds like a very small table fan on its lowest setting. Why bother? Your central conditioner makes more noise. The adjustment--two ways of turning the top and side--allows you to set the sound level between very quiet and extremely quiet. We use sound machines to block ambient noise from outside our children's bedrooms while they sleep. For this, the Marpac is worthless (in fact, my 3-year-old complained that it wasn't loud enough). In addition: considering what it does and how flimsy it is, it is very overpriced. Better products (louder, more sounds, better adjustments and settings, better construction, etc.) are available for half the price."
1,Marpac 980 Sleepmate & Sound Screen Cond. White Noise Sleep Machine,I found the sound on this machine irritating and actually prevented me from sleeping. It sounded more like a fan blowing than white noise. The volume control was also poor. Does not warrant the price. I would have liked to have known exactly what type of sound this product emitted before I purchased it. There was also a restocking fee of $10.99 which I felt was excessive.
4,works very well,"We never thought we'd need a noise machine, but we found it helped our baby stay asleep when there was a lot of ruckus going on, either in the house or outside. It's not pretty, but it's solid and does the job without crapping out. We can have soirees downstairs, and with this on, our daughter can't even hear what's going on.She's a good sleeper, and she's not dependent on the white noise to be able to sleep (she's now 13+ months and sleeps regularly at grandma & grandpa's and they don't have one), but it's really, really helpful most nights."
3,Its a fan in a thing of plastic.,"I was really excited to get this and it has been a couple of months now and this thing seems to get the job done for the most part but.. all it is is just a fan with a cover on it. That's what it pretty much sounds like too. I don't see why its 50 bucks. A small desk fan i was using before did about the same job and was about 30 bucks cheaper.For what it is, it's good. I sometimes would be able to tune out the sound of this and still hear all the things of the outside world that would annoy me. Doesn't seem to get too loud to the point where I want to hear nothing."
2,Not thrilled!,"I was not thrilled with the sound conditioner and gave therefore gave it a two star rating. Although there are adjustments that you can make to modify the pitch, there aren't enough adjustments. It sounds like air blowing through the air conditioning vents. This might work in a large office but not in my home. I sent it back."
5,great product,This product really works.It creates enough white noise to drown out all the noise around you when you sleep.Use the top and middle sections to adjust the noise to your liking.
2,L-O-U-D,"Sleep machine? Sure, for everyone who's idea of relaxing is cuddling up to an aircraft engine. Yes, this thing blocks noise; but a relaxing, soporific breath of wind it is NOT. The ""volume control"" is a joke: it produces a barely-detectable modulation of the pitch, and almost no change in volume at all.Drama aside, the noise it makes it about what you'd hear if you stood up and pressed your ear close to one of those blowers above your head in an airplane. REALLY close. Like impaled on.I'm just amazed at the high ratings this device has gotten. If you put this in a far corner of a big room with a couch in front of it, you'd successfully blunt the sound of the folks in the apartment below discussing what to make for dinner--without being deafened in the process. Otherwise I don't see what it's good for.My search for a PEACEFUL white-noise generator continues."
2,Not for a Therapy-based setting...,"We purchased two of the Marpac Sound Screen 980A devices for our office. We were hoping to create a more private environment, as even the smallest amount of noise can be distracting in a therapudic setting. The machines did not meet our expectations in the least. Typical office sounds (ie. copy maching, receptionist answering the phone, quiet hallway conversation) were not masked by the machine. In fact, the sound the device produces is similar to wind passing through a tunnel, and is almost more distracting than the sounds that we hoped to eliminate. We sent both devices back, hoping to find a product that would suit our needs more effectively."
2,It gives off a buzz,"I never thought of this when I ordered the product. I used it for about a minute and that was it. As opposed to other types of sound generators, this generates its white noise by a fan circulating and causing the noise. Indeed when set at a low volume, you could clearly hear a buzz or hum coming from the machine. When I set the cap and collar for the loudest white noise, there was a beautiful white whooshing sound. BUT, there was also the hum which could be heard through it. This was sufficiently annoying that it was not usable. I returned it and got a refund."
4,Too quiet,"This is a good product but it's much quieter than I expected. It is not nearly as loud as my fan, so it does not really block out the street noise. I'm keeping it, but I wish it was louder."
2,Not as great as I'd anticipated,"I purchased this item to try and mask the sound of my neighbor coming down the stairs outside my apt. every morning at 6:30. Unfortunately, I can still hear the noise even with this thing turned on High.I also feel like it is priced too high as it does not feature a variety of sounds like other (less expensive) sound machines do. This machine creates a sound equivalent to having a fan blow all night. You can vary the air flow a bit by turning the top which is just repositioning the vents by a few inches.I wanted to return it but the seller states that they will charge a 15% restocking fee unless there is something wrong with it. Between that and the price of shipping it back, I figured that I might as well keep it or sell it on Craig's List. But it has done me no good for my present noise situation. I am back to wearing ear plugs at night and the sound machine stays off."
4,good for people who need a fan to sleep,"I've always been awoken by little noises such as creaking and people walking above me. For years I slept with a fan, but it was getting too cold and the blowing air was starting to bother me. This noise machine is a good alternative to a fan. It's a smooth sound and there is no blowing air. I find it covers up noises pretty well (although not entirely) and it's very soothing. I can't sleep well without it now."
5,Good White Noise Machine,"We bought this machine to block out the sounds of birds in the ""conservation area"" that fronted our bedroom window. It has really done the trick. If you want a machine that makes steady white noise only, this is a great machine. Also it is small enough that we can take it on trips to put in our baby's room."
1,Marpac 980A,"I was disappointed with this white noise generator and returned it. I was hoping for something that would mimic the static noise you get from a radio that is between stations, but this machine just sounded like a fan. For the price I had expected a little more."
2,Yes - But a huge caution if you travel internationally,"This product is awesome in terms of doing what it is designed to do.The real problem is whether/how it works when you travel outside of the US. I travel overseas a lot and really need a white noise machine in busy city hotels. I have had two of these units literally explode after a few minutes of being plugged in (once in Germany, the other in China). In both cases I was using a travel adapter that all my other appliances work with.There are no warnings/instructions or guidance of any kind about voltage / currents / using while traveling. There is some cryptic note that talks about this being ""polarized like a table lamp"" which means absolutely nothing to me and certainly doesn't help re: travelSuch a shame that a good product made in the USA has incomplete documentation that doesn't think beyond our borders."
1,Too quiet,This device is not worth the money. I have a box fan I paid $10 for that is louder. Your money would be better spent else where.
1,Not a Noise Maker,"This white noise maker is not actually a noise machine, but a small fan housed in a plastic tube. Since this is the case, it doesn't get any louder than a fan would. I was very disappointed with it, it didn't drown out any noise, but just sounded like a fan on top pf the noise. I would not reccommend this machine."
1,NOT HAPPY,"this product sucks..............just a noise I can't stand. My friend has one with with a choice of the ocean, rain, babbling brook etc. This one would drive you to drink. Tried to send it back but no printer. Would not suggest anyone to buy this product. Has a screatching sound that come on and wakes you up. Henceforth it sits in the drawer."
2,Loud and noisy! Makes an obnoxious sound. Don't bother!,"I bought this to substitute my tower fan for when the winter comes so that I wouldn't freeze to death. I was hoping that the sound would be similar to the gentle wind blowing from my fan. Unfortunately, at a low speed it sounds like a muffled bathroom fan and at high speed a screaming jet engine. There was no way to adjust the volume so the noise was just grating to the ears. If you want something to lull you to sleep at night, you're better off just recording some rain sounds onto a CD. There was also this weird rattling sound when I moved it around. At one time one of the parts inside the product got stuck so that when I plugged it into 3 different outlets, it wouldn't even turn on. This is a flimsy and horribly designed product that has very little adjustable options. Don't even bother."
2,GREAT IDEA! but motor squeel too annoying,"I bought this product to replace a fan as white noise. I viewed an in store model that was broken and making aweful noises, but purchased anyway because the reviews were so positive! Tried for 3 nights, and didn't sleep good for any of them. The motor that runs the fan makes a noise that can be heard over the whooshing of air. It was not even a consistent noise, so it was very noticable. It almost sounded like the fan was just barely scraping the casing, and would make a rattling/high pitched noise. Went to exchange item, and was asked if I would like to test new one. YES, please! Unfortunately, it made the same noise, so I took a refund. I hate sleeping with a fan because I have pets and allergies and it dries up my sinuses, so it is sad that this product did not work as expected."
3,Does the job...,This product has been pretty successful at eliminating the noise throughout the bedroom of my city apartment. I can sleep soundly without hearing my neighbors. The only noise it has not shielded me from is when they slam their door. I recommend the dual speed since some neighbors are louder than others...
1,expensive fan,This product is totally useless. It sounds like a fan... no mask for any noise...I tried all I could do... Still a fan..
5,Works great,Recently moved close to railroad tracks and this allows me to sleep through the night. The train horn used to wake me every 2 hours. Highly recommended!
3,The noise is disturbing in my opinion,"I bought this for my toddler based on reviews but for 50 dollars I was disapointed that it sounded just like a fan (only in a scary movie kind of sense). I got a 25 dollar baby sound machine instead (one that makes wave and heartbeat noises, etc.) and it has been great)."
5,Sleeping soundly,Product works great; this is the 2nd time I have bought this product as a gift. Both people have loved it
4,Definately helpful,"After a few weeks of service this product is working well. We are getting accustomed to the sound it makes and find that it masks most intrusive sounds so that they do not keep us awake or awaken us from sleep. It has 2 loudness options: high and low. my wife wishes it would have a lower one, but I think she will get used to it the way it is in a little while."
5,"White Noise, The sound of a great night sleep!","I LOVE IT! My doctors office has them all over the place, and I borrowed one for 2 weeks. It helped my sleep so much I HAD to have one for myself!You will not be dis-appointed!"
2,too loud for me,"I was so excited to receive this. I have been using a fan for white noise for years and thought it would be nice to have something more compact that I could travel with. My problem with it was it was just too loud. For the cost, I feel it should have more range of settings, particularly a quieter mode. I felt like I was in an airplane cabin."
4,Great product!,"At first glance, the sound machine looks very outdated and old, but it really does a great job of masking noise. Our son had gotten used to sleeping with a humidifier, but I was tired of filling it, so thought I'd try this instead and it is awesome! They could work on updating the look, though!"
4,Very helpful,"Recently got my SleepMate and it is very effective. Somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom, and I don't have any trouble sleeping. I use to wake up at least 2-3 times a night, and have the hardest time getting back to sleep. I hardly ever wake up at all now.Great product, and I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night's sleep."
5,Great product.,My husband snores loud enough to keep the people awake several streets away. This has allowed me to drown out that sound that has kept me awake for years. Its light enough to travel with.
3,"Good sound, but did not last a year and wish for volume control","I bought this July 18, 2010 and on May 12, 2011 it developed a rattle. Since my husband likes this specific machine so well, we will be purchasing a second one in the hopes that this was a one-off incident.I wish this had a volume control. I find it a bit too loud and use a hand towel to muffle the sound a bit."
1,Not nearly as loud as advertised,I have a very variable work schedule and typically have to work nights and sleep when I can during the day in noisy environments. I have been using fans for white noise but it gets freezing in the winter time with the fan blowing around. I was hoping with all the good reviews that this machine would be the answer. Let me tell you its not nearly as loud as my fan even when set to the highest volume and placed near the bed. I am returning it.
4,It's A Keeper.,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is one of those people who *needs* a fan to fall asleep, and I simply couldn't take it anymore. I hated the feeling of wind on my face while I'm trying to sleep, and I woke up with a sore throat pretty regularly. This little doesn't look very fancy, but it does it's job well. I think my husband would have liked it to be a little louder, but I like it. Serves it's purpose. You can twist the top and change the tone of the noise, there is volume control, and it makes a natural sound. I would recommend this for my friends and family."
4,Works as advertised...,"Okay, so I was very skeptical about this when I saw it online... I live in an apartment complex off a fairly busy street and ambient noise levels are so loud that I was willing to lay down some money to try and reduce the effects. I turn it on max power and it seems to wash out the other random noises from the street-level. Cars and buses can't be heard zooming by any longer and I only tend to hear fire trucks or police every once and a while now. I also have a roommate and the walls aren't that thick so it washes out the noise from the tv for the most part. It's basically like having a fan next to you but slightly louder. The sound it makes is not quite comforting but it's neutral if that makes sense. I turn mine on every night now and the loud ambient noise is not much of a problem anymore."
5,Sleep Soundly,I love my Sound Screen. We sleep with a fan on all year round. I am so used to sleeping with white noise in the back ground. But whenever we would go places and spend the night I couldn't drag a fan with me. I recently went away for the weekend and took my Sound Screen with me. I had the most wonderful nights sleep in a motel. Thank you so much for your product. I will recommend it to everyone.
4,Good white noise,"My husband uses this to drown out the noise of the kids in the morning. He also wears ear plugs. It's a good quiet hum, not annoying, not a miracle worker but very helpful. My husband says he loves it!"
5,Great Product,The Sound Screen works great at masking the irritating sound in my left ear from tinnitus. Very portable and I take it with me on any trip. Great Product and I own two of them.Bill
4,Great white noise machine; wish it could be even louder,"We got this white noise machine for our toddler, and I highly recommend it. It works great to block out the sound of squeaky floorboards in our old house. I do wish it was louder. It does have volume control and two settings, but I think just a little bit louder would work even better."
3,"Nice, quiet, mechanical sound","I bought this second, as a sleep solution for my husband who has tinitus quite badly. When the primary machine started making funny noises, we brought this one out. *I* thought it was just fine, a lovely little non-repetitive white noise maker, however, it only has two noise levels, quiet, and quieter. It did nothing to calm his tinitus, and he actually couldn't hear it.I think it would be fine in a baby's room, but if you're looking to BLOCK other noises, it's not going to get the job done.Oh, and I didn't get this initially because we had cats, and I'd read that cat hair and dust can affect it's ability to produce noise. We probably haven't used it enough to worry about it, but have had no issues with dust or cat hair."
3,On my 5th Machine,"My 4 year old child is very sensitive to noise and cannot sleep without this machine. The first one we bought in 2007 worked wonderfully, and lasted nearly 2 years with very heavy usage (lots of naps plus bedtime). Since then, the quality has gone downhill. Even though we are using it much less, the machine lasts 6 months at the most. This is a lot of money for a fan that won't run longer than a few months. But our child can't sleep without it, and mommy needs sleep."
1,Don't buy this product if you need to block out snoring,"I purchased this product because the reviews stated by several purchasers that this machine did a good job blocking out obtrusive noise, even on the lower fan speed. One review specifically referred to blocking out snoring which was my reason for considering this machine. My husband snores and we currently use a fan in the room for the ""white noise"" but wanted something that wouldn't cool down the room in the winter. The ""white noise"" produced by this machine on the high setting wasn't loud enough. After several nights of trying different locations for the machine, the only way I could block out his snoring was to put the machine on the bed, right next to my head with the machine on high. Needless to say, I returned this product. If you want this machine to block out snoring, I don't think this is the product for you."
4,Doesn't sound like a fan,"I bought this to replace my fan for white noise. The other reviews said it sounded just like a fan, but it does not. It does block out noise, but not as well as the fan. I will still use it when I travel but not at home."
1,Clinical bought this product Psychologist,"I bought this product for my clinic since I heard noise coming from the other room of the clinic. It I worked nicely, but only for 1 day. After that it stopped working. An electric engineer who checked on it told me the engine was burnt down. Since I live in Isreal it is too much effort and time and money consuming, and I will have to find another solution. So I am very much disappointed for wasting my time and money. Certainly, I cannot recommend this productMARPAC SleepMate 980A Dual Speed Electro-Mechanical White Noise Machine / Sound Machine for Sleeping at Home & Travel"
1,Not Even Close to Loud Enough,"I originally bought this to use for my 6 month old so that he doesn't hear the dogs barking or other noises in the house while he is napping/sleeping. Currently, we use my iPod w/ white noise downloaded and we have it turned up really loud. The problem is that the iPod has a slight pause b/w tracks that can be disruptive. I *thought* the Marpac Sleep Conditioner would solve this problem. I thought wrong. You could whisper outside my son's closed door and be heard over this pathetically low white noise. Not worth the money."
2,not as advertised,"first things first. This thing will not make a DENT in another person snoring in a room. If there is a sound in the same room as the marcpac you WILL hear it.It doesn't say it in the description but I have heard claims that this will mask construction noise. It WON'T. If they're building a house anywhere in your vicinity you will absolutely hear hammers and saws. This item also does not mask noise if something is pounding on the wall of the room that the marcpac is in. It also will not work for very large rooms. It will only really work for a small bedroom. Forget the living room.Don't get me wrong. It does kinda work. It will probably help you sleep you're neighbor is grinding coffee and that bothers you. You will still be able to hear children playing outside, dogs barking and helicopters.If you have a lot of noise around your house, I would suggest getting an electronic white noise machine so you can crank the volume up. This one only has two settings."
4,Good as expected,"It was delivered quickly and worked immediately as soon as I plugged it in. I just wish it maybe had a few more options other than the plain old ""white"" noise, but it does work as advertised and we use it every night."
5,Great Night's Sleep,This is a great little machine for getting a good night's sleep....saw it used in another home with small children and knew I wanted one for our home...wasn't disappointed.
5,My small appliances are now safe.,"My son is a restless sleeper like me without the benefit of a healthcare plan and cheap prescription sleep aids. Over the years, he has confiscated countless noisy electrical items in his search for an uninterrupted night of sleep only to reject them. Box fans made him too cold, the humidifier caused his basement bedroom to emit a vaguely swampy odor, cds and sound spas had a perceptible loop. This Christmas after purchasing a very nice heater fan that I didn't want to go missing, I bought my son a Sleepmate. He was able to adjust it to a sound that was pleasing to him and ever since has been sleeping great. I'm left to wonder who is this bright-eyed boy at my breakfast table. My only regret is not having bought it sooner; worth every penny."
5,Useful and Inexpensive,Our office bought three of these due to the confidential nature of our business. We have one in the hall outside each of our office doors and they work great. The white noise background drowns out even the loudest voice (mine :) ) and we recommend this item 100%!!
5,Perfect,This is the PERFECT amount of white noise! Definately helps my baby sleep but is not distracting. Its well made and durable!
4,Does exactly what I need it to,"I should have bought this much sooner. I didn't buy it sooner because it seemed to me for what the device does it should be cheaper. Perhaps it should be but the peace it has given me has been worth the price. A neighbor a couple houses down leaves for work at 4:15 AM. I know this because that is when his dogs start barking. After failed attempts of trying to address the problem, and after much frustration, I bought this. I haven't been woken up since! I love that you can adjust the pitch. I keep it on low speed and it isn't too loud for me, but I could see how it may bother others. It does seem to make my bedroom cooler. I don't notice it blowing any air but it still must move enough air to make the it a bit cooler. I put another blanket on my bed. It would be nice if it looked a little better setting in my bedroom. Minor complaints though. I really have enjoyed it."
5,Sleep -- Yay!,"While I still am awakened at 4:30 am by a sudden rush of commuters with bad mufflers on their way to the factory down the street, this little sound machine makes it possible for me to fall back to sleep again as my ears get used to the two sounds merged. Yay. So what I'm saying is this: For me, sudden new loud sounds can make their way through the white noise, BUT, if that noise is sustained your mind will readily accept it as part of the white noise and go back to sleep. This means no worry about missing the alarm, or the baby."
2,Not convinced,"I bought this to help drown out my snoring so my husband could sleep. It is not a very peaceful, relaxing sound. In fact, it is somewhat annoying to us. So far it has not worked for our purpose, but maybe it has worked well for others."
5,Very effective,"Particularly good for helping you get to sleep. Barking dogs (in the distance), traffic noise, lots of background racket just gets drowned out by the innocuous fan noise. We own several -- a couple for our bedroom (1 on each side), 1 for each guestroom, and 1 to travel with."
5,It took me about a week...,"But then I was in love. For me, there was an adjustment period but now it helps me immensely. I even turn it on before I am ready to sleep and it ""gets me in the mood"". Blocks out annoying noise-although if were, say, the sounds of a jack hammer or other construction noise I don't know if it would do the trick."
2,more annoying than the noise I am trying to cover...,"I had high hopes for this machine given the reviews I read here. I'm sorry to say, it's annoying!There is no way I could sleep with that in my room, even on the lowest setting. By chance,we turned our central air conditioner on last night and that was the best solution so far."
1,Not loud enough,"This thing just doesn't get very loud at all. It make noise, but it should be about 10 times louder..."
2,Not relaxing at all,"I understand how this product would be useful for some people to drown out other noises, but it is not at all relaxing to listen to. It just sounds like a fan. I'm not sure what this ""whooshing"" sound is people are talking about? I bought it for my 8 month old son's room and when I had it turned on it was so distracting that he was looking around for where the sound was coming from, so I had to shut it off to put him down for the night. It's too industrial sounding. I understand how it would help some people but for a baby it is not at all soothing. I bought the Graco sound machine instead and it sounds beautiful! Great for a nursery."
2,Has a Whine of Its Own,"I purchased this to cover the whine of a large central a/c unit outside my window in my apartment building. I have to warn anyone sensitive to noises like that - this unit has a whine of its own. Yes, you hear a soothing rush of air, but you can hear the whine of the motor of the Marpac underlying the air noise. Perhaps this particular unit was defective. I don't know. Maybe this would work for someone not as sensitive to noise, but I had to return mine."
4,Maroac Dohm White Noise Machine,I like this machine but it isn't loud enough and there is no way to adjust the volume. It is very sturdy and would be perfect if I could simply make it louder!
2,"Not loud enough, not effective enough","For as effective as this product is supposed to be, it does not mask very high and very low (bass thumping) frequencies. You will still hear all the annoying noises, just a little bit less. Also, the white noise sound is not loud enough to cover the other noises."
1,Just Use Your Computer,You can get the same sounds from your computer for free; there is not a need to buy this product.
1,It has a fan to make mechanical noise - just buy & use a fan !,I have been using soldering fumes fan {eight inches} for years.Wanting to check out other sleep aids and found this item.Read a couple reports were they opened it up and found a fan.Why not just buy a fan and use that ?
5,White Noice Machine Works,This product worked very well for us. It has helped our son sleep much better at night. It is not too loud and the adjustments are easy to use.
3,Sound Screen,Well it works. It drowns out other noises that upset my dogs at night. I think it is overpriced for what it is though.
5,Fantastic noise machine,"We live in a New Jersey highrise overlooking Manhattan, but we're right above the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel and an active fire department. The machine doesn't block out the sirens and honks, but it does minimize them tremendously and it does mask the traffic noise. Thanks for the good nights sleep."
4,Works well,"It doesn't drown out all of my toddler's noise, but I think t helps block some noise so my husband can work from home."
5,Saving My Sanity,"The first Marpac Sound Screen 980A Electro-Mechanical Sound conditioner I purchased was for my daughter who was having trouble sleeping due to bawling cows, howling cayotes and barking dogs. She said it saved her sanity. When I moved to the same area, it didn't take long to realize that, in order to save my own sanity, I would need to purchase one for myself and I did. Not only does it aid in blocking out bawls, howls, and woofs, but also traffic noise and a crazy mockingbird that frequently chooses to ""mock"" all night in a tree outside my bedroom window. And.... then there's this noisy old boy who sleeps next to me. The peace and quiet of the country is not what it's cracked up to be. I'm proud to recommend The Marpac sound machine. What will they think of next?"
4,Sound Conditioner,"The product was shipped quickly, but I couldn't sleep with it for some reason, so I contacted the seller and got a refund. They were easy to deal with, but they do not give you a full refund. There is a restocking fee and they will not pay for return shipping."
1,Ineffective against bass frequencies,"Works well for higher frequencies since it gives the sound of rushing air but I already had a fan for that. It's completely ineffective against what was and is keeping me awake, bass frequencies like helicopters flying over, large trucks from nearby construction, footsteps on the ceiling, etc. If there's a product that produces a constantly, low bass tone I'd love to buy it."
2,Generates more than just white noise,"For the last 8 years, my wife and I have used a white noise generator to help us sleep. Unfortunately, a power surge destroyed it, so we started looking for another. This product looked promising because it didn't use a prerecorded white noise loop; it actually generates white noise.The problem with this product is that you can hear the high pitch whine of the fan inside the unit in addition to the white noise caused by the air whooshing out of the slots. This made the noise it generates sounds more like a low power hair dryer, than a true white noise generator. For the price, you think they could have used a quieter fan."
4,Sleep At Last,The Sound Machine does an execellent job of drowning out the disturbing sounds that keep you awake. The main sound that was keeping me awake at night was my wife's snoring. (She can get pretty loud.) The Sound Machine drowns out the snoring and allows me yo get a full night's sleep. Great product! Does what it is supposed to do without being offensive.
4,Better than a fan!,We have used a fan for nearly ten years and had gotten used to the noise. But not only does the fan freeze us and mess up our sinuses it also costs a boat load in electric. This product is small about the size of a small round cake. This makes a nice sound that doesn't irritate me. The only thing is sometimes I wanna turn it up a little louder. My husband also likes it and the fan has been OFF since Christmas : )
5,Great buy!,"It was a little expensive, but still worth the money. It is small and lightweight- great for traveling. It does not have much variety in sound, but the sound it does make is just fine. I definitely appreciated it this week as we were staying in a hotel with construction right next door. Others were complaining about the noise, and I didn't hear a thing!"
5,Guests love it!,My husband and I first used a white noise machine furnished by a hotel which was located on a busy street in a city. It was so helpful that we purchased the Marpac 980A for our guest room. Our guests love it! They can follow their own schedule - go to bed and sleep when we stay up late watching TV or sleep in undisturbed when my husband gets up early for work. It is easy to use and has more than one sound level.
2,Good but I thinks it's starting to pack-up,"I am reviewing this from Australia. After many, many inquiries I was finally able to purchase this conditioner. At the end of the day, it was quite expensive for me to do so. I've had it about 2 years now.I was under the impression that it would last longer than this (being made in the US) even though the warranty was for only 12 months duration. Mine has developed another noise (outside the usual 'white-noise'). It sounds like a bearing is failing; as its rather a 'tapping' sound. Interestingly, this is a simple machine to produce. It's made up of a miniature fan mechanism (yes, with blades and all). I'm just wondering if I'd be better off replacing it with a miniature desk fan and sitting that beside my bed (directing the blades away from me when it's cold).Despite the above the conditioner has worked well in the past to assist me to fall and stay asleep by blocking out irregular noises. With this extra noise, it fails to improve my sleep now."
2,too loud,If you are buying this to mask annoying sounds then it might do the trick. If you just want a soothing sound to lull you to sleep then this machine is WAY TOO LOUD. Even running inside a closet on low speed with cap and collar fully closed it can still be heard throughout the room. But at least that achieves an acceptable sound level. So before you buy make sure you have a place to put it or it will become just another annoying sound. If I still had the receipt I would return it.
2,PLEASE mail to Alaska - we are a U.S. state!,"The White Noise machine itself is great. But for some reason the company won't mail to Alaska! I had to have it shipped to a friend in Oregon, who mailed it to me. That added 2 weeks more and $10 more to shipping. HELP!!!! Alaska has been a state in the union for for 59 years now; the mail arrives every day . . . . . . Regular mail is all we ask, not UPS or anything fancy."
1,Too Loud!!!,"This machine is too loud for sleeping. The volume control isn't a normal volume control; you can adjust how much air flows through, but it doesn't really make it any quieter. We have these in the lobby at our church, and they do a great job of masking noise from the lobby during the service. But this device is terrible for sleeping. I'm going to buy a sound machine with a real volume control on it."
1,Extraordinarily Loud and Bizarre Whirring Sound.,"This white noise machine is very very loud, yet you can hear this weird whirring sound, like the electrical current changes during use or something. Anyways, I found it hard to fall asleep with it on."
1,Beware of Amazing Warehouse Deals - Selling Returned Items as New!,"I received this machine in a damaged, generic box. It was not provided in the manufacturer's box, which leads me to believe it was a returned item. I could send it back to them, but I would have to pay for the postage (and buy a shipping box)!Shame on Amazon for allowing such a business to sell items through their website!"
5,great machine,"I cannot sleep without noise in my bedroom, in the summer I use a fan even, in the winter.Now I have the sleep mate/ sound screen 980A,I took this on vacation a few weeks ago and I love it. It is small enough to fit in my small suitcase,and loud enough to help me sleep."
5,Can't sleep without it. Period.,"This product is one of the best things I have ever ordered. I am a light sleeper. This blocks out all the little nioses that would usually wake me up. I have to disagree with other reviews, though...this product (by no fault of it's own) WILL NOT block out a snoring partner. Now that I've used it for 5 months, I really can't sleep with out it. LOVE it!!!"
3,Marpac SleepMate 980A Sound Machine,"This seems to be a good product; it just wasn't right for us. I bought this for our newborn, because she would only fall asleep if we held a hair dryer next to her bassinet. I was looking for something more convenient that required less supervision and wasn't a fire hazard. We tried this machine for a few nights, but it wasn't loud enough. It might work for some people, but it didn't even do an adequate job of blocking out our neighbor noise once the baby did fall asleep. Too bad, because I liked that it was small and easy to move throughout our house or to take with us when we travel."
3,nice but not loud enough,I enjoy the sound but my complaint is that it is not loud enough to cover up my mate's snoring. I have to use this in addition to another noise maker on the computer in order to get some peaceful sleep. I don't know how it could possibly cover up construction work down the street like another reviewer mentioned. I like the quality of the machine and think it will last a long time. It is good if you don't have too much noise you are trying to cover up. It would be nice if they could come out with a newer version that has a volume control.
4,Gets the job done,"Just loud enough to drown out sounds. We use it for our daughter and its nice that its real noise and not artificial. I wish sometimes it was a little louder, but it works and isnt annoying."
1,My $10 desk fan is louder,I was excited to get this fan to help drown out my neighbor's noisy dog a few houses down. Nope! This thing is really quiet even on the high setting. I need a LOUD whooosh. This is as loud as my microwave. It's going back.
1,Overpriced,I thought this was top of the line but it's basically a fan inside a metal box. Move on to the more modern models
2,Disappointing. Too Quiet!,"Years ago, Brookstone made a terrific sound machine called Tranquil Moments. It had great volume control and would mask any sound. The unit Brookstone sells now is way too quiet and we've been looking for something to replace their original machine.This is not it!! My husband and I kept it but only because it is better than nothing. We laugh when we turn it on at night because you can barely hear it! It hardly masks sound at all.I definitely don't recommend this if you're looking for a great machine. Keep looking. I am."
2,Not as effective as reviewer claims,"Really doesn't work as well as people say. I got this to drown out the ruckus of my upstairs neighbor's stripper shoes, slamming closet, etc... since one can only wear earplugs so many nights in a row. Basically there are 2 rotating sections you adjust to try to match the frequency of the offending noise. But in my case this actually varies quite a bit. Plus you are supposed to place this between you & the source of noise, but here it is all over my ceiling so not possible. I do like the soothing whoosh from this product, but bottom line is, it's just not loud enough even at the higher setting. The only way it works is if I place it on my pillow right next to my head."
1,Not effective,"If you want to cover the sound of a baby breathing, this product won't work. So if you need to drown out something even louder, i.e., music from a neighbor's house, this product FOR SURE is not for you. I was very, very disappointed and sent it back. The advertising is not true."
2,not near loud enough -- get a box fan,"Opened the box, turned it on the ""high setting"" on the dual mode machine, and I was very disappointed at the volume. The actual sound it makes is a very pleasant sound of air blowing, but its just too soft. I sent the device back to amazon (which, if you are the type to read reviews, you probably already know, has an awesome return policy). I instead purchased a large box fan, and I find that sound volume and is enough to create the white noise I am looking for to sleep."
4,"High quality, but not quite loud enough for our baby","This is a great white noise machine, it makes a very organic sound. Unfortunately my 3 month old needs very loud white noise and this machine is not quite loud enough."
2,No Uniform White Noise (not mine anyway),"I'm a very light sleeper and need constant uniform white noise if I'm in an environment where there's any type of outside noise. I do not know if it was the particular Marpac sound conditioner that I ended up with or what, but the white noise emitted was not uniform in that there was a regular clicking sound amongst the white noise. It was not a pronounced click, but very subtle. Unfortunately, my brain clasped onto that minor little click and would not let go of it resulting in ""no sleep for me."" However, it may have just been the one I ended up with. If mine had produced constant uniform white noise, I would have been thrilled because the Marpac sound conditioner is very well made and does produce the sound I was hoping for - if only mine didn't have the bloody click."
3,Covering up baby noise,my husband thinks it works like a gem. it takes a couple nights to get use to the humming noise but it works pretty good. i think it helps the baby sleep.
1,Broke within an hour,"Just purchased this model and was excited to use it. Plugged it in an it worked only for an hour. I checked the fuse in the plug to see if it had blown and it was fine. Re-plugged it into several other working outlets and nothing. Machine broke in less than an hour. Worst off to ship it back will cost more than what I paid for the machine. Beyond disappointed,"
5,"Couldn't be without ""these"" Sound Screens","Hi! I am a day care provider, and I am purchasing my 5th Sound Screen! Not because they wear out, but because my own family keeps stealing them from me. I have one in each room where ""my kids"" sleep. I take care of 3 babies under 12 months old and a 19 month old. I have used these since I started doing childcare and they are fantastic. Even my fussiest baby will sleep with these on. I leave them on in my bedroom 24 hours a day 7 days a week, because my husband and I are each on different schedules. We live on a street that the neighborhood kids like to drive up and down with their radios on full blast, and the kids, and even I, sleep through it! I have had these now for almost 3 years and have had no problems with them. I would recommend them to everyone. This one goes to my Mom & Dad who are quite elderly and have a noisy dog next door."
5,Peaceful Sleeper,"Takes a little getting used to, now can not sleep without it. Very comforting sound and has been extremely helpful with drowning out the constant ringing noise in my ears. Before I could hardly go to sleep and stay asleep. Very pleased with the white noise machine and would highly recommend this product if you are having trouble sleeping; it totally drowns out annoying sounds. Very comforting using Amazon as well, for this purchase."
2,Not loud enough,"Would be fine, if it was 4x louder. Will only mask very quiet sounds. Not useful for most situations."
4,It's definitely white noise,"This product does make white noise. It sometimes gives me a headache if I use it overnight, but it helps drown out my neighbor's heavy footsteps. It sounds similar to my window air conditioner unit."
5,All I hoped it would be,"I blame my fan-noise addiction on growing up in the south without air conditioning. My floor fan provided not only relief from the oppressive heat but also a noise that I associated with going to sleep. I still use a box fan in the warm-weather months, but it gets a bit too cold, even in Georgia, to use a fan during the winter months. The Marpac is the perfect ""white noise"" solution for me--simple to use, adjustable, and without those annoying sound loops that so many sleep machines have. I don't need crashing surf or chirping rain-forest birds. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best."
5,Works like a charm....,"This unit produces a fan-like whir that helps masks sounds coming from neighbors, trains, and traffic. It has two speeds that puts the volume into two ranges that can be further adjusted by twisting the cap of the unit. I highly recommend this product."
5,AMAZING,"I am the lightest sleeper in the world. So, I had an AC Unit in my window all summer and through the fall because it was SO loud and I would sleep like a baby. Come October, I decided it was time to take it out. Tried sleeping a few nights without it, purchased 3 different fans that didn't compare and then started looking at sleep machines. I was really skeptical as to how loud this machine would be or how ""soothing"" but it works wonders. It's not LOUD to the point that it's obnoxious but it has just the right tone and noise level to keep me asleep all night even when roommates are getting up and moving around. I would recommend this to anyone who likes semi-loud sleep aids. It's tiny, portable and I would for sure buy it again."
3,When I turn it off.... I have ringing in my ears,"This product definitely helps, but even on the low speed and sitting on the other side of my bedroom, when I turn it off after being on all night my ears are left ringing for a few minutes.... I dont find it very soothing, but like I said it helps block out other monotonous sounds. I'll try a wave machine, rain forrest radio next."
2,already broken,"This is my first review of a product. I should start off by saying that I enjoyed that the sound was generated by the machine and not a loop recording. There was no pattern in the noise and I needed that. Howerver, I did not think we could ever really get the noise machine loud enough for our liking. But the really frustrating thing about this machine is that we have only had this since May and it quit working today! I have not started the return process so we'll see how that goes...but I don't think that it should have quit working already."
2,Stopped after 2 weeks,Received as a gift. Thought it was wonderful until it stopped in the middle of the night. Customer service said to send it in for repair or replacement at my own expense. They were not at all apologetic. The new one does not work as well. It is quieter and doesn't seem to have as much power.Very disappointed!
3,It's Okay,"I bought this product because I read reviews that it was the best white noise machine for light sleepers. It does provide white noise, but I can still hear background noise (airplanes, talking, snoring). It provides a somewhat smoother sound than my $10 fan I used to use to block out noise(there's not the rattling sound of the fan). However,next time I'd invest in a new $10 fan rather than $50 on a white noise machine."
5,Finally found a great white noise machine,This is GREAT- we have tried several of the prerecorded sound machines and find them annoying. I am ordering a second one for my mom.
4,Great product,"4 stars because it's not loud enough, but I love the noise and the baby sleep like a baby!"
3,Good but even quietest setting is loud,We live in in the city and purchased this for our daughters room. It generally works very well. Our only complaint is even on its lowest setting its too loud for everyday use. We keep it in her closet with the door ajar to muffle it and its fine.
4,Does the job!,"I was skeptical of this product as I am of most noise machines. Typical white noise machines have no bass to them and that is the key to cancelling the noise and helping ""hum"" you to sleep. UNtil I found this product, nothing worked as well as our powerful fan, which has a solid bass tone to it.This product works just as good as our fan, and without the constant blowing on us in the winter time. I also like the fact we can take it on vacation with us and use it rather than turning on the a/c or heat, just to make noise.I would definately recommend this."
4,Nice loud fan noise,"A little expensive for what is basically a fan, but it works wonderfully. It is nice and loud, and blocks out noise from the TV in the other room quite well. It makes nearly the same noise as my furnace fan, so I don't notice when that is clicking on and off."
3,Nice and compact but needs a louder setting,I like this noise machine because it is small and lightweight and I would have been able to pack it in my suitcase for traveling but it is not loud enough. It perhaps needs another setting that is louder. I have been using an air purfier which works great and blocks out all noise/sounds but I wanted something compact that I could fit in my suitcase and this would have been perfect.
5,Great product!,"When I received my package and opened it, I was surprised at how small the unit was and worried that it may not be able to produce the sound effect I was looking for. I plugged it in, adjusted all the different settings, and am VERY pleased with the quality. Good things DO come in small packages. Anyone thinking it's not loud enough either isn't adjusting all the settings available or is used to a jet landing in their bedroom. I would recommend this to any light sleeper or anyone looking for white noise."
5,Great little noise maker,My wife says that she is getting a better nights sleep. I still wait until she is asleep before going to bed to let her get a head start
3,It's OK,"It is OK. It blocks sounds a distance away in my apartment. However, it does not block sounds coming from the adjoining apartment next door. Loud Noises can still be heard."
1,Just stopped working after 5 months for no reason,"This machine worked great, blocking out noise perfectly for about 5 months. Then one evening I turned it off so that I could watch TV and when I went to turn it back on to go to sleep, there was no sound. I tried different outlets, different volume settings, and nothing. I can tell it's on because there's a faint vibration that starts when I flip the switch, but no noise. I'm extremely upset about this because now I can't sleep at night and I received zero paperwork with the product that would allow me to take advantage of any warranty and it's way beyond the return policy deadline. It's a shame because absent the short, sudden death it was a really good product."
5,Great Item for Sleeping Soundly,"My tween son always has his fan on for a ""white-noise"" effect which gets a little chilly in Minnesota during the winter and my younger son always has his fan on whenever the windows are open to drown out the sounds of the local fire department/ambulance and this item has erased the need for both. My tween and younger son both wake refreshed and aren't woken up by my husband, me or the dog in the early morning or the snowplows or trash trucks that come rattling through the neighborhood. My older son always was calmed by running the vacuum cleaner when he was an infant and I don't know if that has anything to do with his need for the white noise or not but regardless....this has been worth every penny and my tween son takes it with him when we go out of town too which is great for blocking out hotel noise, unusual sounds when staying in a new place, etc."
3,Ok product,"Product is ok. I expected a louder sound on the high setting.I am a very light sleeper and the sliest sound will wake me,so i wanted something that would drown out all noise.If the sound on high setting was a little bit louder it would probably accomplish this. With that said,the machine does a pretty good job.If a noise is keeping me up,I just move the machine closer to my ears."
2,I'm Sending the Marpac Packing,"This machine is solid and seems to be very well made. Unfortunately, the volume isn't nearly loud enough to be effective for me and my significant other.Hi or low speeds didn't seem to make a significant difference in volume, and twisting the unit merely changed the pitch from higher to lower and everything in between.I really wanted this machine to work for me, but the volume just wasn't enough.Jim"
5,Wonderful!,I purchased 2 of these to put in my spa massage rooms to eliminate any outside noises. They are amazing and the therapists can't believe the difference between the room and when they open the door. I would definitely recommend them for any noisey situation and plan on purchasing another one for my travels.
5,supreme white noise,"looks a little dated, but is small and takes up very little space. creates great seamless white noise in my daughter's room that drowns out the noisy treadmill during nap time. love this little machine!"
3,"Good, but not perfect",The whirring sound isn't the most relaxing for me... but it does cancel around 80% of sound... which is generally enough for me to sleep through.
4,Works Great But Why So Much,"We have it in our upstairs hallway and it works well enough to mask noise for all the rooms off of the hallway. Currently considering buying another one. But I cant figure out why this thing is so expensive. Its just a fan and some plastic. Almost $50 seems like a lot. But then again, it works very well."
5,Fantastic!,The product does what it says it will! Makes for pretty soundless sleep! I work nights and live next to a construction site so sleeping during the day and be difficult but the sound machine has helped a lot!
5,sound conditioner,"My daughter got this for her young child. I have problems sleeping and have every cd of rain, streams, thunder, whales, loons, and you name it. After talking to our daughter, my wife got it for me. This machine is not really a noise to make you sleep, but blocks out any other noise so you can fall asleep faster, and stay asleep longer. Have had it for a couple of weeks now. We use it every night. Hope it last for a long time."
3,only OK,"I also own the Marsona travel machine which I like better. Although this one is adequate I like the ""sound"" on the Marsona better. And it is smaller and less noticable in the room."
4,good but makes clicking noise,"I love this thing and it really helps me sleep. However, it started making this ridiculous metallic clicking noise. I thought about returning it, but then took it apart and fixed it... kind of. I essentially just bent the fan a little in a certain direction and the clicking stopped, don't ask me why."
2,Not what I thought it was,It does not have the volume that I need or perhaps it is too small for the room that I have it in. It has not helped me in the least.
4,Amazing!,"I love this sound machine. It's the first time I've ever used one and I'm very pleased with how it works. I wish I had gotten it sooner. Before I had trouble sleeping some nights, even with ear plugs because my roommates would be up talking loudly in the other room. But, now I have been able to sleep much better and without the discomfort of ear plugs. The sound machine creates a good noise screen that pushes other noises outside my room into the background so that I hardly even notice them."
3,"bought 2, one works great,","I purchased 2 of the exact same models.One is perfrectly smooth and sounds like the first one I bought 2 years ago, but the 2nd one I bought with this one at this time has a weird little ""buzz"" that keeps me awake.Until now having bought 3 machines I like 2 out of the 3.John M. Pasquale[...]Sure would like to get that bad replaced."
5,Great Sound Conditioner,"I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a white noise machine. Very natural sounding white noise not that synthesized sound you would hear from other sound machines. Simplistic design, so I think this item will last for years to come."
3,"Great for me, not so great for baby","While this sound machine is great for me and my husband, we bought it to drown out noise from the street and noisy neighbors to help our infant sleep, and unfortunately it isn't loud enough. Babies need very loud white noise to mimic the womb, and we have to use a fan in addition to the Marpac in order to drown out noise. We are returning it and looking for something louder. Bummer, because I really like the authentic and continuous sound this machine makes."
3,Disappointed.,"When I found this on a daily deal, I thought it was a bargain, especially if it helped me sleep. Between the Griswald's Xmas music, and the teenager's late night video conversations, I needed help getting to sleep. Upon arrival, however, I discovered that the unit I received makes a constant pitched motor noise - not a high-pitched whine, but distracting enough to bother me - I am pretty sensitive to such sounds; you may not be. The unit is Made-in-America, and seems to be good quality. Much smaller that it seems in the photos - which is a plus. I am disappointed that it didn't work for me, but I appreciate Amazon accepting the return."
4,Met Need,Use for white noise to insure confidentiality from counseling office. Works far better than music alone in reception area. Still does not drown out loud voices.
2,Inside fan spins too rapidly,"I had one of these for years and I finally tossed it in the garbage when the fan inside loosened and vibrated causing some annoying sounds. It seemed to work alright initially but it wasn't until I threw this machine out that I realized that it was actually disturbing my sleep patterns. It was loud enough to cover outside noises but the fan spun too quickly so it didn't allow for a deep sleep. After I tossed it and went back to a regular indoor fan I realized how much better I slept with the fan. I point the fan away from me so as not to feel the wind, so that's not what's causing the longer and more restful sleep. It's the actual rotation speed of the fan. It spins more slowly and thus has a more pleasing and relaxed sound to it.These machines may work for some people but not for me, as I have now figured out."
1,I must have gotten a lemon:/,"I hate to leave bad reviews, but after spending this kind of money, I am very disappointed. The motor started to die down after only a few months and now it's not loud enough to cancel out ANY sound; but solely provides a low, smooth, white noise in the background of everything else. I wish I would have just gone for a digital one with a speaker."
2,Need More,"I am somewhat disappointed in this product. It would probably be adequate for mild, general traffic noise screening. I need a more melodious, harmonious, deeper pitched screen, so perhaps my review is not relevant to this product; but its description did lead me to believe that it would work for my situation."
2,Don't Bother,"I read some other reviews on this both good and bad. I figured I would take a chance, I have trouble sleeping so I figured its such highly liked, I would give it a try. As soon as I plugged it in, I thought to myself...this is not going to work. As someone else stated, it sounds like a bathroom vent fan. Its just a Fan in an enclosure that has holes of varying size to allow more or less sound to come out. Even with the thing spun on the slowest speed and the holes closed all the way as small as it goes, this thing was too loud for me to sleep with.My Suggestion, go to walmart and spend 15 bucks on a cheap fan and use that as background noise. I have a cheapo fan that does a great job producing background noise."
1,"too noisy not a soothing sound,","Machine made to much noise for my wife to sleep, we would like to swap it out for the the better one that has ocean sounds or runningwater."
1,Poor backup from sales and incompatible products,"I bought two of these items. After the first failed I thought that I had connected to the supply incorrectly. After the second unit faied and I had confirmed polarity of the supply it was finally noticed that the units where for the US market and operated on 115V, unlike the Australian supply voltage of 240V. When I contacted ""Amazon"" whom I made payment to, they basically fobbed me of with the ""we are just couriers"". As I made money orders out to ""Amazon"" I that feel they are in some way responsible for after sales service. This has not been the case and now I get a survey to complete - get real eh. Support us or don't bother with these surveys. It just makes me more angry.good day.Eddy."
2,"For as loud as it is, doesn't mask sounds that well","I got this to mask the noises of my coworker in the cubicle next to mine. He chews with his mouth open, slurps his drinks, yawns loudly and often, burps, farts, and grunts all day long. I placed it at the wall of my cubicle that shares his. Unfortunately, it is very loud and gives me headaches if I leave it on all day. Everybody walking by wonders what that loud noise is and why I have it. And even when I put it on the loudest setting, it doesn't mask all the noises, although it does help. It is just not worth the headaches and the questions. Now I am back to plugging my ears with my fingers most of the day."
1,Broken by the time of arrival,"Got it. Ran upstairs, plugged it in and it's broken. Smoke started fizzing outta the top and it stunk up the room. A waste of $90Marpac 980A Sound Screen Sleep Conditioner White Noise Generator Dual Speed"
1,Sound on second purchase is completely different and lower.,"I bought this a few months ago and needed a second one for my daughter where she stays during the day. This second is completely different (and they were both 980), it is not as loud at all!"
3,Like whirling noise? This is for you!,"I'm using it every night. This baby is *loud* x 5. Like a little fan about to explode. You get used to it however and it doesn't have that loop sound the Chinese made ones have. The volume is adjusted by two turning things that limit the amount of air blowing out. It can be made a bit quieter...but no more car, music, boom-boxes...hell, might as well be dead. (And you might be if a silent burglar comes in. :)"
1,Not Loud Enough,"I purchased the Sound Screen to help my dogs stop barking at night. They stay in the garage at night, and they could hear us inside whenever we would use the restroom or take a shower. I purchased it to create a noise floor that would help them to not hear the running water. It did not work. The thing is not very loud at all."
3,Initially I liked it now I have left it.,"Initially I liked it now I have left it. My grandma always says there's always another new mousetrap to spend money on, and I found this to be one of them. While initially I loved it, after a while it just annoyed me and I would forget to put it on all.My advice is to borrow one from a friend who no longer uses there's. (I know I have many friends who are just like me, buying them and then eventually forgetting about them. Now they sit in the garage collecting dust with all the other mousetraps.)If you think this is something you would use after borrowing it for an extended period of time then think about buying it or perhaps your friend will give it you."
5,Love this product,"I have needed something to help me sleep when there is total quiet. This was the answer! I turn it on every night and it is great. I was looking for rain, waves, wind, etc, but this has worked out perfectly for me"
3,It is okay,Well constructed. Would be great for a moderately busy work space . Needs a bit more volume for my sleep situation (clumpy upstairs neighbors). Maybe I need to build a shelf so I can put it right next to my head?
5,Perfect for light sleepers,"I had been using a (massive) air cleaner for background noise when I sleep. I am a VERY light sleeper and will literally wake up when the wind blows. In additional, I recently had two people move in with me who work nights and needed something to help. This is small enough to simply set on the nightstand, and does a GREAT job of minimizing all noises. No weird clicks, abnormalities or anything. Just a constant ""whiring"" sound kind of like a fan but more concentrated. Now I don't even wake up when the front door opens!"
4,Sound conditioner,I have a constant pulsing in my ear and this helps to block it out so I can sleep. I wish it has more than 2 settings though. And the intensity would be better to have more levels. But it does help and I'm grateful for that!!
4,Nice machine,"I was a bit skeptical about this device at first but after using it for a year or so, I have become a believer. The noise is neutral and constant. The only part I dont like is turning it off in the morning... it sounds so... quiet! So, if you are looking for a no frills noise making machine, this is a solid and functional option."
4,Fast shipping,"Product was as described but could be a little louder, but does as it says. It would be great if this product came with a remote."
4,Makes a big difference!,"I bought this because my new neighbor starts his humongous truck at 5 AM and it sounds like he is in my house. His kid plays basketball for hours. The smack of the ball against the shared driveway and the back board echos between our houses. The Marpac unit helps to muffle these sounds. It doesn't completely eradicate them as I'd hoped, but it takes the edge off the sound enough, allowing me to at least partially retain my sanity."
1,Did not work for us - not loud enough,I got this item last week . The main idea was to make my 8 month old daughter sleep longer without getting interfered with all the noises....but this machine did not help us much...I didn't think it was loud enough...The fan worked better than this for white noise..returning the item
4,Great Baby Sleep Aid,"This helps drown out the noise of our family while our baby sleeps. It seems to soothe her really well. I remember wanting to capture the noise of sitting in an airplane for our first daughter since being on an airplane guaranteed to put her to sleep. The marpac does that. It can be loud and fast, quieter and fast, or loud and slow or and a bit softer and slow. So there are essentially 4 different volumes based on turning the switch to high or low and then twisting the top to allow more air or less air to flow.After a couple of nights of using it, all I have to do is turn it on and baby (7 months at time of review) knows it is bed time. My 3 year old shares a room with her and loves it too. :)"
2,"Too heavy for travel, not enough volume control","For my use this machine was not right. First and foremost I was looking for a travel sound machine to drown out the street noise in hotel rooms. This machine is surprisingly heavy and bulky for plane travel where every ounce and inch counts in a suitcase.Also it was surprisingly noisy! I mean there is no real volume control, just minimal adjustments. I have a Marsona machine which is lightweight and has volume control but I didn't care for the sound (waves, etc.) but I returned this one and will take the other.On the plus side the whizzing noise was effective and pleasing. But it is still going back."
3,static sound,"I was a little disappointed. A friend of mine has one of these; hers may be a different name brand. I borrowed hers two years ago for a cruise we went on, and I loved it; it had the true sound of a fan. This one seems to have a loud static sound that almost makes my head hurt. It's pretty loud. My husband likes silence to sleep, and I like a fan on med. or low; we're trying to find something that we both agree on so we can sleep in the same bed...this machine isn't going to work. This is my second sound machine I've tried; I'm starting to think nothing can replace a good ole fan."
3,Bought to replace fan in cold weather but took some getting use too!!,"During the summer we ran a fan because we shared a room with our baby. Of course him and I both got used to the noise. Then winter came and it became to cold to run the fan at night so I began to look for a noise maker. This one had such great review I decided to go with it. When I first opened this with the tv on and the kids running around I thought the slow speed was pointless because I could hardly hear it. Until I went to my quiet room then the low seemed to loud... so of course the high is way to loud. It does adjust some when you turn the cover to try to get the sound you like but it still doesn't sound to much like our fan. If you are used to a fan this will take some getting used to. I do wish this sounded more like a fan and was a little quieter and a timer would be nice but I plan to keep it with hopes I will get used to it. Also, It seems a little pricey.. there isn't much to it. It better last a LONG time :)"
2,Annoying Noise,I bought this item because my apartment is too close for comfort with the neighbor upstairs. Well I have to say the white noise this item made gave me anxiety attacks. It was burdensome for me to handle. The best option for me is to move. I can't sleep with any kind of noise. This machine may work well for some. Maybe I need a machine that as different types of smoother noise.
1,No good,This product was noisier than the noise I was trying to camouflage. Returned it and got my money back.Oh well.
4,very effective,"While this product is completely efficient in providing white noise at night to block out barking dogs and car sounds, etc., it's not what I would call attractive. It is replacing a clock/radio/sound machine which looked much nicer."
2,Desperately wanted this to work for my baby,"But sadly, it wasn't loud enough. I need it to be about 3-4 levels higher / louder than it is to keep my baby (who hates sleeping) asleep....had to return it...."
4,Get this model rather than the 1 Speed model,This is my second Marpas SleepMate 980A. My first one still works and has brought me a zillion good night sleeps since I got it in 2006. I wanted another one to place it next to where my dog rest when I am gone - to help eliminate noises so she doesn't bark. It is really important that people who are buying a Marpac SleepMate to get THIS MODEL and NOT the single speed model. This model has two speeds to it but the lower speed is really not much - it certainly will NOT do the trick for me or my dog.
2,Sent it back,"Despite the ability to adjust speed/sound it was too loud for me! I found it hard to believe some reviewers said it was not loud enough. Amazon was wonderful about the return, though, so it was a good experience overall. Sometimes you just don't know until you try it out."
2,I have tinnitus and hyperacusis and found this to make an irritating sound,"I suffer from tinnitus and hyperacusis so I was looking for a white noise generator to mask it. Most of the reviews of the Marpac were great, but I did read several that mentioned an unpleasant high pitched sound that was produced alongside the white noise. When I received the item and turned it on, I heard this high pitched noise immediately. I left the unit on for a bit to see if I would stop hearing it, but it continued to bother my ears. My partner, who has normal hearing, also found it annoying. I sent it back. I've continued to use my fan and air filter to produce masking sounds instead.Amazon provided quick and awesome service as per usual."
3,Sleepmate,"2 speeds are fine, but not nearly loud enough to drown out area noise. My wife can't use them & we are considering returning them."
5,Amazing,"It's just what I needed and well worth the price. I purchased one before but lost it in the divorce. If you have any trouble sleeping because it is too quiet, this is what you need."
5,"so far, so perfect!","UPDATE!!! I still love it and it is soothing to the baby but it does not really block out noise at all... I can still hear little things over it such as my husband close the trash can or microwave in the kitchen! But great for what I purchased for. (white noise for baby)So I am only on night 3 with this, but me AND my two month old, love it. It seems very calming to her and little did I expect, TO ME TOO! Its smaller than I thought it was gonna be which is great, but puts out a great amount of noise (if you want it to). Completely satisfied as of now... Will update later on!"
1,Went up in smoke!!! Be careful,Had it for awhile it was great. Then putting my two small kids to sleep smelled fire couldn't figure it out for a minute- then I realized it was smoking!!!!! Thank God it didn't happen in the middle of the night. Scary.
2,Not loud,This machine not as loud as I expected....this product certainly can not cancel out outside noises. In my opinion so not worth the price
4,About what I expected,"I moved into a studio next to a major El train intersection in Chicago last week. Somehow in looking at the place, I missed all the train noise that comes through (some not so loud, some similar to a rolling thunder/comet coming at you). After getting sick of earplugs, I bought this little guy. It's a lot like a high-power bathroom fan on in your room; a nice, constant whirling. It didn't really drown out the train noises (that would probably be impossible), but did help in that the background noise of the noise machine made the sudden loudness of the train not as intense and shocking. I think it's probably a psychological thing where your brain already hears some noise, so a new noise is less intruding. Anyways, it's not a total problem solver, but one that I think will help me keep my sanity at least."
3,"It works, but not loud as I had hoped.","Bought this for a small room to drown out noise from a sewing machine next door but was futile. This will drown out light noise but definitely not high mechanical noise like a sewing machine - I decided to just hook it up in a bigger room to drown out light noises like snoring & talking in the distance. If you want to drown out loud noises next door, you're better off hooking up speakers to an mp3 player with white noises on it."
2,Too loud,"My husband and I both found this machine to be too loud even on the lowest setting. We needed something to cover up things that ""go bump in the night"", but this WAS the ""bump in the night"" that we couldn't sleep through! Return was easy and refund was quick so overall the experience was good although the product didn't meet our needs."
4,Better Night of Sleep,My daughter is a light sleeper and this has helped her sleep without the distractions of household noise etc. We use it every night. Happy with the quality and the function.
2,not to happy,"I ordered this item for my grand-daughter.. who said ""if it cost more it is better""? Well this item wasn't better.. The sound machien ""white Noise"" maker we had that died after a year was $12.98 and very loud. I should have stayed with that one.. I didn't .. So I spent $35.00 more and we are not near as happy. The sound isn't very loud, and that is what I was getting a ""white noise"" machine for, the noise. So, if you are looking for a loud white noise machine this isn't it.."
3,Not loud enough...,"I was surprised to see that people thought that this was helpful with drowning out the sounds of barking dogs, honking horns, etc. I am a night shift worker and our bedroom is right off the kitchen. I need something moderately loud to block out all of the extraneous noises. I found this to be pleasant but I could still hear extraneous noise, even with the volume turned up high. I will continue my search for the perfect noise machine..... I will say that my money was very promptly refunded, though, so if you need to return it it's not a hassle."
5,Fantastic Product!,I have one of these in every bedroom of my home. My guest love spending the night and sleeping well from the relaxation the Sleepmate provides. I also use the Sleepmate 980A in my granddaughter's room while she naps during the day. She...well...sleeps like a baby...smiling. It filters out all the noise outside her bedroom window. Well worth the purchase!!!
3,Not as loud as a box fan.,"We bought this product hoping to replace the big box fan in our room we use for noise to sleep, but unfortunately it is not as loud as a box fan. Great product for what it is, just not loud enough for me."
2,"No volume control, humming noise, ringing in ears","I bought this based off of so many reviews, however, I am returning it. Number one there is no volume control and it to loud for my area. Second, there is this very annoying humming noise coming from the motor. It sounds like it's going to take off.... and third, each time I turned this on, it caused a strange ringing sensation in my ears and making them feel like there was pressure in my ears. Sorry, not so great."
3,Not Loud Enough,This is a good product but I found that the white noise simply is not loud enough to block out any sleep wakening sounds.
1,Tinnitus Suferers Beware!,"I'm sure this does the job for a lot of people - it is loud, and oddly the same loudness next to the bed or across the room! and on low does hava an added high pitched noise, so if that bothers you - don't do it. But the far more serious problem is that yeah, I slept right through it and the a/c fan on....and when I woke up and turned it off, my ears are ringing louder than they have since I first got tinnitus 15 years ago. And it's been 12 hours. I really really wanted that perfect night's sleep others have had - but this is actually scary for me. I haven't had a noticable ringing in years...and this is loud. So if you do suffer with the same problem, I'd recommend an alternative - any alternative solution. Good luck to everyone!"
5,tones down snoring sounds,"My daughter, her husband and 5 year old son went to Disney World and stayed in the hotel together. Her husband snores loudly and makes sudden snores too. My grandson can not sleep with the noise. I gave her the sound screen sleepmate . The noise from the machine eased the sound of the snoring for my grandson was able to sleep. Now they are home aand he has it in his room and sleeps better every night. I also have the machine and use it when my neighbors are having loud parties outside at night. I don't hear them when it is on."
4,High quality white noise machine!,"We bought this white noise machine for our infant daughter; she's never been a great sleeper and we hoped a white noise machine would help drown out other noises in the house. It has definitely helped, and we would recommend it to other parents looking for some ways to deal with sleep issues. This is a real fan that you can adjust to make a noise most pleasant to you; I'm glad we got this instead of one of the electronic recorded playback type of white noise machines."
3,too loud,"Good little machine. It would be a great machine if there was a better volume control. Even at it's lowest settings the machine is quite loud. We ended up putting it on the floor under our dresser at the far end of the room. We also purchased Marsona's next best model, #1288A for a comparison. That model does have a better volume control but you pay almost three times as much, and it has a bunch of other sounds we would never use (like hooting owls for example). All we wanted or needed was the white noise."
4,Great for Apartment Living and Working,"I work from home in NYC and this device really helps w/ blocking out ambient noise. It won't block your upstairs neighbor dropping bowling balls above you but it will block low level television noise from the apartment next door. Much better than regular ""sound machines"" which produce a weird artificial ""white noise"" that is more annoying than helpful.The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is the design. It would be nice if it looked a little nicer since I like to keep it out. Perhaps a selection of colors or at least a brighter white color would be nice."
5,Awesome!!,"I have tinnitus really bad, it was driving me nuts at night where I couldn't sleep even with a regular sound machine. I ordered this because it was just like what I have seen in doctors offices and it has been a blessing to me, I can sleep now.....Thank you,Paula West"
2,Great... but didn't stand the test of time...,"This was a fantastic little machine. However, it stopped working after only a few months. We used it each night in the baby's room, it was turned off each morning. I am going to look for another brand, hopefully a brand that lasts a little longer."
5,"reliable, good volume, excellent white noise","we have several of these now,one for each bedroom. good volume/noise control with simple turn on the side or on the top (allows slightly for pitch control). no fan. no complaints at all. we've had ours for over a year without any problems at all."
5,Heavy snorer in house this drowns em out!,Drowns outneven wallmshaking snooring! It is a bit loud and i needed to put it about 10 ft away but i sleep like a baby jow
4,Marpac 980 sleep machine,We grew weary of using a space taking floor fan as a white noise sleep aid and purchaed the Marpac 980 white noise machine to replce the fan. It functions well and helps mask any outside or in house noise. It produces a fair amount of sound so we placed it in our closet with the closet door partially closed. This works well to modulate the sound to our liking. Would highly recommend the Marpac machine.ZZZZZZZ
4,Almost perfect,"We were looking for a ""brown noise"" generator, wanting a lower-pitched sound than white noise. The Marpac is adjustable enough to get really close to perfect. By turning the outside and top bevels you can change the volume and the pitch. It's also small enough to take along when we travel. I'm glad we bought it!"
2,I'll stick with my fan.,"While this is a well-made product which does exactly what it is advertised to do, I could not get used to it. A few other reviewers said it would take time adjust. However, I could not fall asleep with it on. Having been used to the low hum of my smallish box fan for a year, the sound was too high-pitched for me. Having said that, it is a great product - wish it had worked for me."
4,Great Buy!,The sound machine works wonderfully. Our house is really small so any noise wakes our baby up. This is a great purchase if you want to help your baby sleep longer and peacefully!
4,It's pretty good,"The sound screen is pretty good at blocking out noise from our busy street. We bought it to replace a tower fan that we were using purely as a noise producer but was causing our room to dry out. It is definitely nice that the sound screen doesn't dry our room out.There are two levels of sound for the screen. One is pretty quiet and the other is pretty loud. The louder setting does a good job of blocking out sound but isn't all that soothing. Both are consistent white noise.I am a pretty sound sleeper once I fall asleep and I hardly even wake up to loud trucks or honking horns. My fiancee is a light sleeper and she finds it quite helpful in blocking out the street noise.The $50 price tag is a little steep for essentially a small fan, but it is designed pretty well and does the job. Really easy to set up. Just plug it in in and hit the on button and you are set.Overall, a pretty good white noise machine."
4,sleepy time...,"This performs exactly as advertised. The unit emits a pleasant, neutral whirring purr that facilitates relaxation and sleep. It has two settings, one a bit louder than the other. For people who like this sort of thing, this is just the sort of thing they'll like. I do!"
4,does the job,The Marpac SleepMate white noise machine does the job as far as blocking conversations next door goes. The only problem I have is that since it is supposed to be adjustable it could use a lower setting. It's actually a bit too loud even on the lowest setting and sounds like a wind machine not just white noise.
3,Pretty useful but not loud enough,"I got this because i just moved to a place on a busy street in chicago. Even with the windows closed, i hear cars, buses and worst of all, motorcycles driving by, and the occasional people screaming. This is no way to sleep. This product has helped drown out some of the noise, but even on the higher setting i don't quite find it to be loud enough to drown out all the street noise. It has helped though. Another con is, it looks like it was made in 1970, and is pretty large for what it does."
1,horrible motor sound,"This created the most annoying motor sound I have ever heard. Maybe we had a defective unit or I have a rare sensitivity, but the frequency of the noise made me feel ill. I couldn't stand to be in the room with it on. It hurt my ears, it hurt my head. It did not sound soothing or natural. We returned it."
2,Annoying motor sound,I bought this product after reading all of the reviews. I tried it for 3 nights and could not stand the whining noise from the motor. I tried different setting and still could not get past the motor noise. I was able to return the product with no problems.
2,Not what I thought :(,I purchased this item after days of researching it and many other sleep machines. I was so disappointed to find out it did NOT block out all the noise from my 2 neighbors. I live in a 100 yr old house that has been converted into 3 different apartments. Wish it had volume control-that would of produced better results.
2,Disappointing.....,I ordered this product because of noise problems from living above a bar and a Starbucks - I get the drunks at night and everyone chatting outside the coffee shop in the am. This product does not help at all! It just does not make enough noise to block anything out. So now I am back to using a box fan and sleeping soundly :). I ordered it in the hopes of retiring the box fan for something more compact but now it is sitting in a drawer collecting dust. Wish I could have returned it!
5,Works great,"I have difficulty sleeping without ""white noise"" in the background. Previously, I've used a fan, but in the winter time, I would get cold. Overall, this product works well and I highly recommend it.PROS:1) I like the fact that there are multiple settings to get the ""white noise"" that suits you best.2) No wind, as with a fan.3) It really blocks out other noises well. I live near a road with traffic, and it blocks out the traffic noise very well.CONS:None really. The sound is different from a fan, which I've gotten accustomed to over many years, so it will take you some time to get used to this product. Give it at least a few days or a week, so you can get used to the new sound."
5,Amazing,"It is shocking how this little machine does what it does! I live in an apartment building and other people's noises are always heard in my space, especially at night. Not any more! It really drowns out intrusive noises. I can't live without it at this point. G-d bless whoever made this machine!"
3,Works on voices but little else...,"This works great on some background noises and voices. However if you purchased this sound conditioner because you live in an apartment with loud upstairs neighbors forget about it...It does nothing to drown out footfall sounds, furniture moving, running children, etc. The upstairs apartment has wood laminate flooring and I hear EVERYTHING. Even the sound of cupboard doors can be heard in my apartment so I was hoping for something to help me focus my attention on something other than my growing anger because of the loud, unpredictable noises emanating from above. If you are looking to drown out voices this is a great option. If you want to eliminate or at least reduce other annoying apartment sounds this doesn't cut it."
2,Not loud enough,"The product works fine but it's too quiet, even at the higher level. It might be great for a rural or quiet suburban area, but if you live in an urban area, like we do, it's not loud enough to drown out outside noise (even with window closed, you can still clearly hear someone talking at normal speaking level 3 stories below)."
5,Just what I wanted !,"As a very light sleeper, I have had to keep a fan on to not have my sleep disturbed by outside and inside noises. As winter came on full force this year I knew that the cold air from the fan wasn't going to work. I looked up noise machines and found Marpac 980A Sound Conditioner on the web. Truthfully, I was a bit nervous about the price, but sprang for it anyway (as desperate as I was). And am very glad I did! It really is perfect...perfect size, perfect continuous white noise (easily regulated)and NO cold air blowing on me. I truly sleep better than ever before. Anyone that is looking for a really good product to block out the noisy world when trying to sleep, should buy the Marpace 980A."
4,Works as advertised,"I had been using fans for many years to block out sounds so I could sleep better. The constant fan noise was always better for me than a CD or the weird jungle sounds and other random sounds that most white noise generators make. This Marpac Sleepmate generates a sound that is much closer to, but not exactly like a fan. The great thing about it is that it isn't dangerous for kids, it doesn't take up any floorspace...just a small spot on shelf, and it is much easier to pack than a fan. I have had it for 3 months now and I am sleeping great with it. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. Enough so that I went and purchased another for my daughter's room. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because it is a slightly different tone and sound than what I was used to and all the adjustments still leave it sounding a bit fake.....but it works."
5,Awesome Product,This SleepMate is awesome if you are accustomed to sleeping with a fan this is a great product to buy. I always used to sleep with a fan which can get very cold in the winter. But now I just put on my SleepMate and it sounds exactly like my fan!
1,Didn't work for me,"This is a basic machine that makes background white noise, which may work for some people but for me it didn't help with nose reduction. By turning the cover you increase or decrease the area through which the noise comes through and the volume of the white noise.I found the machine that costs several times more to be more worthwhile. But I am picky especially when it comes to noise so I didn't keep the more expensive one either (more in the review of that product)."
5,Regulation of minimum volume of 980A,"After extensive research I purchased the Marpac 980A and am very pleased with it. I have a neighbour from hell that has two dogs that bark intermittently all night long. In desperation, rather than looking for someone who has an RPG launcher to take out the dogs and the neighbour, I happened upon the Marpac 980A. Initially I found it to be, even upon minimum setting, a bit too loud. So I placed it in the empty top draw of my credenza and by adjusting the openess of the draw can attain melliflous background white noise. This does not overheat the machine as there is adequate air around it to ensure cooling. Gone are the sleeping pills and desire for a RPG launcher.Paul Cape Town South Africa"
2,So disappointed! This is way too quiet!,"Ordered this to drown out the loud neighbors surrounding our daughter's bedroom in our condo complex. For over 2 years we have used a white noise cd on repeat all night long and are tired of cd player's motor burning out. Like the design of this product, the smooth sound, the padding on the bottom and the simplicity to use it, BUT it is not nearly as loud as we need it to be.I am shocked at all the reviews saying that it was loud enough to drown out their neighborhood noise, especially those in a condo/apt situation. I dont think this would even drown out a dog barking or knock on the door. The sound even at its loudest is barely enough to fill our daughter's small bedroom. We will be returning this product right away. So bummed this wasn't as great as it was boasted :("
4,Great Product,We were already familiar with this product before purchasing. It works well for just providing some white noise at night. It helps to provide a better night's sleep.
5,Once you have one you won't give it up,"We now have three of these. I was septical at first, but after the first time using it I'm hooked. I live in a one floor modern ranch and have an 8 year old and a 1 1/2 year old. If one of us gets to sleep in on a weekend this blocks out everything!"
2,"Works good, be wary of EMF!","This device was pretty good, the kids loved sleeping with it running. Then I purchased a Gauss meter and discovered a whopping 400.0mG of EMF radiating from it.Considering that most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0mG, and anything over 10.0mG is considered an extreme cancer risk this is completely unacceptable.The EMF declined rapidly as the range from the device increases, effectively dropping to 0 at 6 feet. However people that put this on their nightstand should immediately rectify that situation! The fact of the matter is, all electrical devices should always be a minimum of 5 feet away from the body in bedrooms.Even so, I question the engineering of this device if it emits such a drastic level of EMF."
3,Leaks oil! - Got a replacement,"I like the sound, but it started clicking after a month when it first turned on. After four months of use, I jut found a pool of oil underneath it! Now I'm trying to figure out how to get my money back and emailing the company. Made in the USA and I thought it would be a piece of junk.--------Added:I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement and took the broken machine back in April 2011. So far, the replacement machine has not had any issues and is used every night. I would have given this product 5 stars had it worked from the beginning."
3,Just Not Loud Enough,"I personally do not love this sound machine. Sure, it's dependable and quite hardy, but it's just not loud enough for us and for the money, as I think it's quite expensive for what it is, I think it should have another setting or two."
2,Not that relaxing,Product works fine but it is not that effective as mentioned in few reviews. It gets overheated soon. Buy a fan which makes consistence sound that might work better for your sleep.
2,$25 To Repair,This white noise maker was working fine for about 3 years and then started to rattle. It was no longer producing clean white noise - - it almost sounded like a cord inside was rattling. I called Marpac and they said that it would cost $25 to repair. I would have to pay $5+ for shipping so I decided to just throw the unit away because a brand new one is about $50.
4,Powerful little package!,"This white noise machine is only about the size of my hand, but it puts out a very good amount of noise for how small it is! It has a loud and quiet setting, and you can turn the outer layer to make the whooshing noise higher or lower in frequency. The sound itself is very like running a box fan. Some of the reviewers stated it just wasn't loud enough, but I believe if you do put it out in the open as the instructions tell you (and not near the wall) it does scatter the noise. It does a very good job helping me sleep! Much better than using a fan and more energy efficient! The unit also comes with a mail in life-time warranty."
2,Not very loud,I bought this hoping it would help drowned out my newborn's cry in the nursery for my 2 year old since they share a room. It wasn't as loud as I hoped. I have been using his fan on the highest level and even that is louder than this. For 50 bucks I also expected this to be made with better quality as well.
3,It does make noise,"What my wife and I were looking for was a noise maker that made a decent amount of noise. We have always slept with a 20 inch box fan and were hoping for something that would compliment or replace it altogether. This device makes a very low whirling noise, definitely not what we were hoping for but it adds a little bit to the box fan. I gave it three starts because it does what it is supposed to do but could possibly be misleading (to someone like me) as to what it does."
5,Excellent for light sleepers,"My wife has always been a light sleeper, and my snoring did not help her situation. We have been using the product for a little over a month, and we both find we sleep much sounder and longer.The two speeds may be overkill.Highly recommend for the light sleepers out there."
3,Too Loud,Need rheostat control for finer loudness control - dual switch is loud and louder - so loud it keeps me awake from across the room
2,Not nearly loud enough,"What can I say, I live in an apartment and sometimes I want to drown out unwanted neighbor noise. This machine has a pleasant sound to it doesn't really drown out anything (I have tried adjusting the frequency). I can still hear the bus air brakes, my neighbor's TV, my neighbor's footsteps, cars, dogs barking.... well everything. It might be good if you live in a quiet place and you need some noise to fall asleep to but that's about it. I really do wish it was louder."
3,Not Loud Enough,I've had the Dohm-DS for 2 years now. It is a sturdy little machine & stands up to traveling very well. The only problem is that it is not loud enough to drown out noise. I can still hear background noise that wakes me up in the middle of the night when using this sleep machine. I have to use box fans along with it if I want to remain asleep throughout the night. I just might be an extremely light sleeper though. It is winter time though & the box fans are making the room a bit chilly so I think I will try the Marsona 1288A. Maybe this sleep machine will be a better fit for me.
2,Not loud enough,"We ordered this for the nursery to block out other household sounds at night when baby is sleeping, but it is really not very loud, it only sounds like a loud fan. Not worth the money!!!!!! Buy a fan instead."
2,Not a fan...,"I really wanted to like this, but I found it to be loud and annoying. If it was quieter, I think it would be good for blocking out higher frequency sounds like a neighbor's TV, but it's pretty overwhelming. I have even placed it far away from where I have been situated and I don't find it to be comforting or relaxing, just annoying. I don't think it would block out banging and definitely not low frequency sounds like a subwoofer, someone's annoyingly low-pitched voice, or loud engines from outside."
3,Hard to Adjust Volume,"This product definitely masks noises and helps me sleep, but it is loud. Since it is mechanical, you can't adjust the sound below a certain level."
5,Very nice,"I am pretty happy with this little contraption. It isn't like your typical noise maker (rain, waterfall, etc.). It only makes the sound of a constant wind-tunnel, which is my favorite. It has a high setting, in case you have noisy neighbors, and a low setting that is perfect for your room."
5,Works like a charm,Keeps the infant down throughout the night and during daytime naps. Worth every penny for a few extra hours here and there.
5,Great Little Machine,"I have very few possessions that I love. This is one of them. It produces a hum that says to me, ""Go to sleep, and stay asleep.""Recently I stayed in a hotel in down town San Francisco that had no air conditioning. The first night I was awakened by street noise. The second night, I set up a fan I found in the room to simulate the sound of my SleepMate, and I slept like a baby."
3,Ok for real light background noises...,"Got this to drown out a neighbors tv. While it is well built, I think it is overpriced by about 25 bucks. Good for a baby's room, maybe for a traveler's bag, but if you want to mask or drown out any substantial noise, buy a box fan for 15 bucks and know that it will do the job far better than this will. A good product for minimal sound masking, but not nearly loud enough to cover most background noises that would send you looking for a product like this. I'd give one star for sound masking, but it is well made and would be good for traveling. But for an apartment dweller, won't do the job you are likely looking for it to do."
2,Not loud enough,"After reading the reviews, which seemed good I purchased this for my husband who is a day sleeper. It was quite smaller than I expected and was not loud enough to drown out any noise. The a/c unit in the room he sleeps in was much louder than the Sound Conditioner so it was of no use to us. However, I have to commend the customer service. They are great! We had some problems tracking down the package and had to contact them. They replied quickly and even checked back with us to make sure we got our package. Later after I returned the item (which was not a problem) they sent an email confirmation to let me know the transaction (refund) had been taken care of. Even though this purchase did not work out, Hands down they are the best with customer service and we plan to order from them again soon."
4,A Peaceful Nights Sleep,"Both my daughter and husband are extremely light sleepers (unlike me) and have difficulty both falling to sleep and staying asleep. We have three dogs and noisy neighbors so both are usually awakened at some point during the night. With this machine, however, our nights have been much more peaceful as the sound emitted cancels out most nightly distractions! We've all become accustomed to hearing it and my daughter will request it at night if I've forgotten to put it on. Some nights the mother makes a strange labored sound but after about half an hour or so that's usually gone and is my only minor complaint about the machine."
2,better than a fan,"is definitely better than a fan, however doesn't really help me with all the noise that disturbs my sleep (creaky floorboards, doors closing, loud trucks outside) ... would probably return it, but not sure if they'll take it, and too lazy to find out"
5,It covers up my husband's snorzing,"I bought this because my husband snorzes...and it does the trick. At first I used the lowest, quietest setting but now I find that I'm used to the white noise and I love it...at full blast."
5,Saved my sanity!!!,"Our babies sleep through the night so MUCH better with the ""noise machine"". My parents had one while I was growing up, and used it for about 20+ yrs... and so I bought one and then two more for the babies room and my son's room. We have neighbors who work odd hours so they let their dogs out who bark continuously!!! But, even through the day, the baby uses it for naps to block out unwanted noise from the other kids, lawn mowers, etc. It is a GODSEND!!!! Like I said, I own 3 of them. Ohhhh, and the less expensive 1 setting model is just as good as the more expensive one. No need to spend more, it works equally as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
5,Excellent remedy!!,"This works just great where I live at a very busy intersection with lots of trucks and all kinds of vehicles. Some slight sounds get in from loud motorcycles and modified cars, but all and all, it does an excellent job.The instruction manual says it could take a week to get used to having the Dohm on....it took me about an hour!Seems like a quality product and I hope it holds up."
2,Not loud enough,My 4 month old son requires loud white noise to sleep. This machine wasn't even as loud as the Vornado fan we have in his room.
3,"Masks annoying sounds, but makes its own.","As another reviewer said, this product sounds like it is in a hurry to get somewhere. It's an urgent, straining sound. I tried for a couple of weeks, but couldn't get used to it. It does mask other sounds well, though, so if its own sound doesn't bother you, it would work well. I wanted something that sounds like a box fan, but this sounds more like the vent in the bathroom."
2,Not loud enough,"I have the Brookstone Tranquil Moments which is great but the price is double that of the SleepMate. So instead of buying another Brookstone I thought I would save a few bucks and go with the Marpac. I regret it, the sound is not loud enough to filter out early morning dog ear flapping or my husband taking a shower in the next room, both of which wakes my 7 month old. I would spend the extra money and by the Brookstone model."
2,Soothing sound degrades over time,"After running this product nightly for a year now I've noticed that the sound has gradually changed. The soothing ""whooshing"" sound is now complimented by an increasingly noticeable motorized buzzing noise I find to be distracting. Adjusting the vents on the side can help eliminate the noise (by making the ""whooshing"" sound louder) but the problem is getting more apparent. I'm afraid I will have to pitch the thing unless the problem corrects itself (an unlikely scenario in the electronics department)."
4,Solid proformer,"Keep in mind the top and sides can be adjusted to change the sound. Creates a nice sound, but the discerning listener will notice some motor sound that has a distinct consistent frequency. I don't find constant sounds too distracting so it does not bother me. Solid performer i use it every day for the last many months, no rattles or extra noises, solid construction."
4,I hear voices,"This white noise machine is great. I've had it for about 6 weeks and it creates a nice soft sea of fuzzy sound. It's not as loud as I had anticipated, but to my surprise it completely drowns out the household sounds that keep a toddler from falling asleep in our small apartment. The only thing I don't like about it is that recently I have begun to hear voices coming out of it, and sometimes music too. I am not sure what this is about, but now that I have heard them, they won't stop. But overall I recommend this better than any looped, digital, or recorded noise."
5,Good product,The machine does what it's suppose to do. I use it outside of my office and I'm told by others you cannot hear what is being said from outside. I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it highly.
5,djvdelaware,"Excellent, we have had this sleepmate for a few weeks now and my husband loves it. I love it because we no longer have a fan running in the middle of winter. It took me one night to get used to the sound but now I don't notice it and my husband sleeps great. I highly recommend this product."
3,White Noise Review,"Product works well. Simple operation. When I originally started it up there were some internal ""noises"" however after an hour or so it was like the motor went through the break-in phase and works as advertised. I will more than likely buy another one for my daughter."
5,great white noise,"purchased this unit as a replacement for an old one. works great, really helps me to sleep"
2,Not loud enough,"This sound conditioner has a nice whooshing nice, but wasn't loud enough for us. Our goal was to cover the household sounds so our baby could sleep without disturbance, and this machine didn't produce enough noise for that. We have an inexpensive sound machine that we can turn up much louder."
2,not loud enough!,"The sound this makes is a nice, pleasing whir, but not nearly loud enough to mask noise from my neighbors' apartments, even on the highest setting. Do the people who find this machine helpful live in New York City?!? I had to return it and will look forward to the warm months when I can run a large, box fan on high -- nothing I've found works as well."
5,Sleepmate,"You can't find this item in any store with just noise only.This unit is inexpensive, simple to use and reliable.Great product for the money. Only complaint is you have toorder it online."
4,Marpac SleepMate Lives Up to Its Name,"I live in a new housing development that is about a quarter mile from an interstate highway, so I was looking for a solution to the ""noise at night"" problem. I wasn't sure if the Marpac product would work, but it certainly does! The ""hush"" sound it makes is very comforting and took only a few days to get used to. I recommend this product to anyone trying to drown out the background noise of the world. I like it so much that I'm also in the market for a ""mini-Marpac"" for travel."
4,Works great!,This is a very helpful device for the office where I work and conduct therapy sessions. It helps to make sessions more private and blocks out sound coming in to the office.
2,NOT loud enough,"I bought this device because of the overwhelming positive reviews on here, and especially because several reviews commented on how loud it was. I used an old box fan to sleep and after it broke I wanted something that didn't pull air around the room. Unfortunately the highest setting on this device is nowhere near as loud as I need it to be. If you need loud white noise/background noise to sleep, this won't work for you."
5,By far the best,"This machine is great. I love the full rich tone, not tinny and cloying like digital white noise machines. It's the real deal. And I find it plenty loud enough, especially at the higher setting. I bought it for baby's room and now I don't feel at all nervous opening and closing his door or showering in the shower that shares a wall with his room while he sleeps. It's an excellent product. The gold standard for white noise machines."
2,Disappointing result,"I was disappointed with this white noise machine. It was no louder than a small fan, and the noise was not masking at all. I sent this back for a refund."
3,is it just me?,I purchased this in November and I have used it every night. I absolutely love the product but the device started sounding less loud recently. I though nothing of it and assumed it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Today I lifted the sound machine to dust and there was a pool of green acid below it. The batteries or something inside is corroding and/or corroded and is leaking through the foam. It also smells. Great. A fire hazard that lulls me to sleep. Nice.I really loved this product compared to other sound machines but I am nervous to buy another if the battery is going to melt into acid every 6 months. Not cool.
3,Not as loud as I'd like,"I'm glad I got the dual speed model. I believe it's got to be louder than the other, but it doesn't do much for inside noises. It's pretty good masking/blocking outside noises, but not my husband's snoring and other sleep noises. I would have preferred something louder. I'm not interested in ocean waves, birds, etc. I just want white noise as loud as our air conditioner. This machine does help ... I won't say it doesn't, but it's not quite what I'd hoped for.After using this item for a couple of weeks it started making a chattering sound, similar to the sound of the artificial windup dentures (gag gift), thus it was totally unusable. The chattering sound overcame the white noise and made the unit USELESS!!."
4,Pretty Good little white noise machine,"All in all a good product. I think they could have made it more attractive however, since you will have it sitting out in your bedroom. It sounds like you have a small to medium sized fan running in your room, which is what I was looking for. (i.e., did not want one of those silly machines with chirping crickets that actually KEEP you awake.) If you are looking to completely block out background noise, just buy a giant fan instead. Personally I would like it to be a little louder, but for the size, I can't complain."
4,Works well if external noise not too loud,"I bought this because I live in a tiny studio and my refrigerator would wake me up every time it made any noises in the middle of the night. It definitely blocks out the noise of the fridge, and I've been sleeping through the night since I bought this.However, I also have loud neighbors who host parties often. Even at its loudest, this machine doesn't block out the noise of the neighbors. So, if you're looking for something to block out really loud construction noises or something, I'm not sure if this would do the trick."
2,Distracting Sound,"""I had high hopes for this product because I must go to bed earlier than anyone else in the house. I was really hoping that it would drown out other noises and help me sleep. It may certainly work for some people, but I found the noise it made jarring and too loud. I even tried moving it across the room, but no luck. It was not soothing to me, but distracting."""
2,a little loud,"The machine is a little louder than I thought it would be. My husband couldn't sleep with it on. I bought two and returned one but will only use it when necessary, not every night. The return was a pain to do and it cost me almost $10.00 to send back. Probably wouldn't buy from this vendor again."
3,sturdy but not very loud,"I was looking for a sound machine to drown out noise from our rather small/creaky house so our toddler could sleep. This machine looked like it would last forever, but it didn't get very loud. We returned it and got a small digital machine from Homedic."
5,Marpac Sound Screen,The Marpac Sound Screen is terrific. I am enjoying using it on a nightly basis. It offers a soothing sound to sleep by. The only slight downfall with this product is that the sound can not be adjusted very much.
4,Marpac Sleepmate 980 A works great!!,Marpac SleepMate 980A Electro-Mechanical Sound ConditionerI recommend this white noise machine. We just build a house in a growing neighborhood. I put it in my infant's room and it helps mask all the construction noise so he can sleep. I also bought one for my husband and I because I found that a fan made us cold and dried out our eyes. My husband also travels a lot and this works wonders in hotel rooms.
4,Exactly the sound I was looking for,"Now I don't have to run the bathroom fan all night for my seven month old to sleep. This is perfect, the two sound settings are fairly low and medium low but enough to kill the noise of dishes clanking after she's asleep. I would give it five stars if it wasn't so expensive. However, it's made in the USA and has never even gotten warm, much less overheated, after long twelve to fourteen hour nights of use."
5,works,great idea-white noise-yea white noisescrew up in the delivery-wrote amazon-they solved it-my fault or theirs-anyhoo i got i 4 months later-who notiec?it worksshould be great for traveling-cant pack a bag in my suitcaeeeven though it took 4 months to get here i still give it 5 stars-i travel alothmmm
3,nice white noise but not loud enough,"I purchased directly from Marpac after my Sears rain/waterfall white noise machine had a shelf fall on it during the Easter Earthquake, 2010 in California and ruin the dial controls. I'd used the Sears machine for over 28 years happily covering every kind of noise. This Marpac machine is not loud enough when I travel or at home. I use a fan and earplugs. But it definitely helps. I have it right next to my head while I sleep."
4,Marpac 980A,"Love this! I'm a light sleeper & wake easily, especially when I travel. This blocks out unwanted background noise without being annoying itself. Sounds like an air purifier. I liked it so much I had to buy an air purifier mp3 soundtrack so I have it on my mp3 player/i-phone for flights & when I travel so that I don't have to drag this along!"
5,Sleep Aide,"I purchased this item to get some relief from my husband's snoring. He wouldn't wear the mouth insert, or the head harness, and I can't tolerate ear plugs. This little jewel has been a pleasant surprise. It doesn't drown out his snoring, but it let's me sleep in spite of it. Also, I am no longer awakened by the sprinkler every morning at 5:00AM, and other sounds just seem to blur. I keep it on my bedside table and sometimes forget to turn it off in the morning. I really don't know why or how it works, but it does for me! I still wake up for bathroom runs, but I sleep well between them. This is a simple but great idea. I am happy to recommend it. Thank you."
2,a little louder please,"This machine does make a very soothing sound, but it is just not loud enough to cover other noises. My family wakes us much earlier than me, and I am able to sleep because of the small floor fan that I use, but when I tried this product....I was awake the first time one of them walked across the hall. I returned this machine."
5,Outstanding value,"Having used digital white noise systems, audio loops (rainfall, synthetic, etc) and even the bathroom fan to blanket ambient noise, I feel comfortable in stopping my search with this product. Not only does it generate a constant (adjustable) background noise, it actually masks the noises that are louder and creates an even audio environment. If you have trouble sleeping (or working, I'm purchasing a second for the office), this is the product to get."
3,"It works, but it's not a miracle","I live in an older apartment complex, and this gadget is definitely handy to plug in when neighbors stay out on their porches talking at 3am. I didn't know if it would really be able to drown them out, but it does. It takes a while to get used to the sound that it makes, but once I get adjusted, I can sleep. I find that I don't sleep as soundly with the machine going as I do when there is complete silence. I stay a little more on the surface of sleep when the white noise machine is on. However, it is certainly an improvement over the zero sleep I get when people's conversations start distracting me in the middle of the night."
5,Keeps the bugs out...,"I am very happy with the Marpac Sleepmate 980A. As a counselor who works in a less than soundproof environment, I need something to keep others from hearing my and my clients' words. Very helpful tool!"
5,Simple to use & very effective.,The Marpac SleepMate 980A is very effective for individuals who seek white noise while working. Working from a home office often creates distractions throughout the day. I find I am able to focus for longer periods of time when running this machine.
5,I SLEEP LIKE A BABY,"i live near a main street and near newark liberty airport. the noise has kept me awake for years. i purchased this unit and from the first night i slept like a baby. it totally blocks the noise out on the low level. there was no adjustmenbt period to get used to the white noise. if you have noisy neighbors or road traffic, buy this unit and you wont be sorry"
5,LOVE IT!,"This is my second white noise maker ONLY because mine was fried when my daughter plugged it in while on her trip in Europe. This machine cuts out all noise, esp. when turned on loud. Best if you put it on low, so you can hear if someone tries to break in, etc."
3,"Good white noise machine, but...","I bought this machine when my son was an infant, nearly 5 years ago. It has performed well for all this time. The white noise is a steady, soothing sound which allowed us both to sleep with other noise in the house. I like the fact that you can rotate it to change the volume and also the pitch of the sound. But... it's just not the loudest sound machine on the market. It is definitely louder than some others that I've checked out, but not as loud as one a friend has, from Sharper Image. Now that we have even more noise in other rooms of our house than ever, I need more to mask the sound for my light sleeper. Right now I'm using a fan and this white noise machine, but came looking for another one. I may just get another one of these and use two of them in his room."
4,Sound Sleep,Works as described. Kinda wish it was a tad louder but I guess I could move it closer to my bed if I wanted to.
2,Nope,It made the noise but not what I thought it would after reading all the reviews. My box fan does a lot better then the item I bought. I returned it the same week.It would have to make a lot more noise to be efficent.
3,"Unfortunately, not for me","I really, really wanted this to work, but unfortunately things didn't work out. Even though it's loud enough, it doesn't drown out bassey noises. I could hear my husband below me closing cupboards and opening and closing the microwave. I know that some people can sleep through this, but I can't. I think I'm so used to my AC fan that I can't use anything quieter. I'm really bummed. I think it will work for most people. Unfortunately, just not me."
4,Does the job,"I bought this for my baby's room. This helped to drown out outdoor noise when the window was open in her room or if there was noise in the house while she took a nap. There are 2 levels but I only use the lower level (which I find is already a bit loud). I should have bought the other version with just 1 sound level. Because it's small, it's also convenient to take with you while traveling if you need to."
1,What the .......?,"The unit works as it is says in the description. Another web site listed it as a good item for tinnitus. It does diddly squat for someone with tinnitus. As for background white noise, it works just fine."
5,Best purchase ever!,"At first I was a little worried about the effect of the sound machine, but soon enough, you'll find that it's easily worth the money.I like in a room where all the pipes run through the adjacent walls and anytime someone flushes or uses the water in the house, it's just SCARY loud. After buying this, I'm actually able to sleep through the night and i don't know where I'd be without this.Highly recommended!"
4,Wind Machine Review,The product came promptly and was packaged as stated.I am very pleased with the way you can change the pitch of the sound or even the speed of the fan. If I get the chance I will surely recommend the Wind Machine to my friends.
4,Great product,"We used this machine for ourselves for about a year and loved it. Now we have used it for our baby for 10 months and it drowns out any outside noise in the house. It is starting to have a slight interruption in the noise consistency, but it is not terribly noticeable and our baby definitely does not seem to mind."
4,Basic Noise Generator,"The Marpac 980A performs its job as specified. It is a simple""white noise"" generator that blocks other noises, such as snoring,which may be more objectionable. It does not offer multiple arti-ficial sounds as more expensive machines do."
3,Can't fall asleep without it!,"I wanted to invest in a quality noise machine. This was a good buy. I like the two speeds. It also allows you to move the screen over the opening to mute it a bit. It made a weird buzzing noise last week but stopped so other than that, night after night it covers the noise from my street."
5,Great product - drowns out sleep-disturbing sounds,"We've been using these Marpac sound screen products since our kids were toddlers. The adjustable white noise they produce has been a great help...not only at home but on the road as well. Drowns out any sleep-disturbing sounds. Has two speed settings, and then the top and sides of the body are adjustable for fine-tuning.If you're looking for a white noice machine - this is definitely worth the purchase."
3,Great item if it lasted,"I bought this item a couple of months ago. It has two settings - high and low. I preferred the low setting as it did the job without making too much noise. However, recently the unit started to rattle on the low setting which was louder than the machine so it was very distracting and kept me awake. I don't know what is wrong with it but the higher setting seems to work fine - at the moment. I'm getting used to the higher setting but it is a little louder than I need. I just tried to see if I can return it and the return window expired so it can't be exchanged. I would think there should be a longer warranty on this type of product.Overall, this machine does block out outside noise and it's been a Godsend for me in that regard. I just don't know how long it will be before the higher setting starts to rattle and I will be looking for a replacement."
4,"Interesting product...makes a loud ""whooshing sound"" like you are in a windtunnel....","Interesting product...makes a ""whooshing sound"" like you are in a windtunnel...but does its job in getting me to sleep--assuming it is relatively quiet already. However, it doesn't ""block out"" noise, like some people say it does (I can still hear kids at the playground across the street from my apt). If you are looking to block out noise from outside, get new double-hung windows and sound-proofing!"
4,Changed my mind...,"I originally gave this two stars because it was way too low for me. I didn't realize that you can turn the side vents, not just the holes on the top. It's probably as close to my space heater as I'm going to get now that I've used it properly. Still a lot of money, but from all the research I've done, it's probably worth it since it seems like the best on the market with regards to white noise."
4,Level of sound,"This product is a great idea. I, personally, was disappointed in that there are only the two levels of sound. I expected more control over the levels one could choose. I believe that a lower level, a steady quieter hum would be better, at least for me. It is made of good quality materials, however. I would recommend this product for someone who is not as light a sleeper as am I."
4,It works,"Been using this for over a month now. It does create a 'white noise' sound. You can vary the pitch from a high and loud noise, to a lower pitch. It does not create the low sound of a large standing fan on low speed, so if your ears are sensitive to high pitched noises this may not be for you. I noticed at the higher level I wake with a ringing in the ear, but I have had that disorder for sometime now and this is why a small fan didn't work well for me. There are two speeds on the machine. With the unit I received I have to run it on high speed for a while before I switch it to low speed. For some reason it does not start out well on low speed. The unit does get slightly warm from running, but nothing to worry about."
5,Worth the buy,I am a very light sleeper and wake up at the slightest noise. I live in an apt with roommates (not easy for a light sleeper!). This machine is great in blocking out noise from TV and conversations. It also helps to block out traffic noise. Plus it is very calming. I was hesitant at first buying this product but I'm happy with my purchase and am glad I did decide to get it. It's been a big help. But it also depends on your needs....it would not block out really loud noises or a snoring partner.
3,could be improved,I live in an apartment complex by a busy street. The Marpac muffles noise but is not loud enough to drown out traffic or noise from the apartment above. Its sound is also a little too 'sharp' - it might be more effective if the pitch was lower (i.e. more of a bass than a tenor).
3,To quiet,I have been using a box fan for years as my source of white noise. I was hoping this would replace it and be easier to travel with. It just is not loud enough for me.8/16/09 Update.... I've used this several times now for out of town trips and it does help quite a bit with outside noise. Much easier to travel with too. I'd probably move it up to 4 stars if I could.
5,Product worth every penny,"I have been looking for an alternative to our floor fans that we have in our bedroom. I have the unfortunate ""joy"" of hearing my heartbeat in my right ear and we have very annoying dogs all around us that bark night and day. My husband and I have gotten VERY used to sleeping with fans on, but during the winter months, it's a little too cold. So when I saw this product online and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I have to say that I couldn't be any happier with this little machine. It has a high/low setting and the sound it makes sounds just like our fans. It helps to drown out the noise in my ear and we don't hear the barking dogs at all. I think most people would find this noise annoying, but for me it's helped me to get a good night sleep. I'll probably take this little guy with us when we travel..I just wish they had a battery operated version of this so when we go camping I can actually enjoy the outdoors...."
5,I love this thing!,"My husband snores and has woken me up several times a night for many years. Recently, when we were staying in a hotel, the AC kept waking him up during the night as it cycled on and off. The hotel provided a ""pillow menu"" that included these white noise machines. I got one for us to help him with the AC noise. What I learned was that it enabled me to sleep through his snoring! I couldn't believe it! I ordered one on the spot and found it waiting for me when I got home. What a wonderful invention! The outside noises no longer wake me on warm nights when the windows are open. I don't wake up to his snoring (and I don't have to wake him up to get him to stop).This machine is a miracle worker as far as I am concerned!One tip- if you are trying to drown out noise that is fairly loud, move the machine closer to you."
3,Just not that loud,"I bought this product for my baby's room to help her sleep better - both from a white noise perspective and to mask sounds that might disturb her. We live in a small space, and so her room is by necessity very close to our living room/kitchen/etc.After a month of use, I can say that the device works fabulously as a comforting, soothing white noise generator. However, because the device is just not very loud (even on the high setting), it does nothing to mask our normal household noises when she's sleeping. Although I haven't returned the product, I'm disappointed that it doesn't do a better job at masking unwanted sounds. If I had wanted just a white noise maker, I would have bought something significantly cheaper."
2,Really exceptionally loud,"This device has two settings - very loud and considerably louder. The loudness in decibels isn't rated in the product listing, but it's much like having a V8 engine running in one's bedroom. I was only able to use it by turning it on the lower setting and shutting it in my closet. The SleepMate 980A is not appropriate for anyone who is not already partially deaf."
3,Not great but OK,Product does what it says but i just wish it had a selection of noise or sounds to choose from instead of a variation of one standard noise.
2,TOO LOUD,For me this product is too loud even at its lowest adjustment I am a light sleeper and I bought this to block out the noise from my neighbors but I can't fall asleep because the noise is too loud. Just my opinion.
1,Sound Machine Too Quiet for Thunder Thighs,"I live in an apartment with paper-thin walls and ceilings. A single mother with a newborn moved in upstairs and I have not been able to get adequate sleep for months now. The baby cries at all hours of the night and the woman is just as bad. She is up at 5am until 8am thumping around like Jurassic Park with her thunder thighs, then sleeps all day long and awakens at 4pm to the sound of her crying baby and is up again until midnight. She stomps around so badly that the walls shake and the popcorn ceiling falls from the sky. I purchased the sound machine in hopes that it would block out the elephant noise but unfortunately at full blast it is still too quiet to mask the Serengeti."
4,disappointed,"Not what I expected, ended up returning it--kept it at the lowest sound and speed, still sounded like a generator, not relaxing, actually very annoying."
5,Buy it... just buy it!!,"I purchased this for my wife because of my excessive snoring. According to my wife, I snore like Fred Flinstone. My wife and I could not be happier because it is able to drown out my snoring and help us both sleep... her more so than me. I recommend this to everyone that has a snoring spouse.Furthermore, I work shift work and some nights I work from 6pm to 6am. I typically can not sleep past 12pm when coming off of night shift, but this white noise maker helps me sleep later throughout the day.This is a must need if you work shift work or have a significant other that snores."
5,Can NOT live with out them.,"We now own FOUR (4) of these machines. We bring them on vacation. We just can't live without them. I have white noise apps on my iPhone and iPad when I travel on business & they're just not the same. Nothing else makes the soothing sounds that this machine makes. We used fans for years, but the investment in these machines was worth it. Each one of our children gets right to sleep and so do we. And they sleep so soundly - no more bumps in the night.I'm on travel now, and I can't wait to get home so I can sleep. I'm going to buy a fifth machine soon, so I can bring one with me.Buy this item. They last forever too!!!"
1,Not loud enough,"I have used a fan to shield my bedroom from outside noise for years, but my wife complains it makes her cold and gives her a sore throat. I bought this to try and make us both happy. This is just not loud at all. A good description of it would be whisper quiet."
1,The Roar Was Astonishing.,We were amazed how something that was supposed to provide soothing white noise produced a noise like that of a train going by. Very loud and annoying.
1,waste of money,Not worth the effort to order. Please tell me how to return this Dohm-ds dual speed etc. item as I am very unhappy with this item.
1,Do not buy this product and don't believe the Made in USA hype,"Ours broke within 72 hours of use. Most US manufacturers use brute force to create ""quality."" There's not much innovation in this product and other sound machines with a variety of selections are more useful than this machine for a newborn or young kids. Don't put your faith in this company or its products...you'll be disappointed. Again, ours broke within hours of use. American quality...whatever..."
1,"""No Sleep"" machine","This machine may work for some people, but it kept me awake all night. I purchased it to mask the sounds of my snoring spouse, but all it did was add to the noise level in the room. I placed it in several different locations in my bedroom but it didn't help. I finally decided to place it in the shipping box and return it. So much for the ""natural"" method - I guess my next step will be sleep-aid drugs."
3,"Good for adults, less so for babies","We bought this based on the slew of positive reviews, thinking it would be a good white noise machine for the baby in our room. It is not loud enough, nor does it block out noise enough, if you have a fussy baby. It's more like a very low-level fan continuously running. You can hear everything over it (even my very quiet typing as I write this review!) However, it is PERFECT for me. I used to run our ac or heat continuously at night because I would wake up when it shut off - too quiet for me. With this, I can stop abusing our ac and heat and instead leave it running. So: good for an adult, but not for a fussy baby or if you need/want to block out sound."
4,Big fan,"Pun intended, I'm a big fan, and it sounds a bit like a big fan. It's got a little more of a whoosh sound than a fan, but it's pretty close. It will be nice to use this white noise machine in the winter instead of my fan, so I won't have to be cold in order to hear the fan-like sound. It doesn't block out vibration sounds well, but adds enough of an ambient sound, that it can make sleeping a bit easier while there is unwelcome noise in the environment."
4,Can't sleep without it!,"We recently set up housekeeping in our vaction home and wanted to get one to leave there. I previously had been able to get it at JCP's when it was the sleepmate but they no longer carry them. I was happy to find it through Amazon. It looks and sounds just like the one I have although my husband finds it louder- even on the low setting- they only have high and low. That is my only complaint. To make it a little softer, we put a washcloth over the top to muffle it a little. It worked and we slept like babies!"
1,Much too loud,"Used to use similar device from Hammacher Schlemmer, and loved it. Lasted many many years, and in four different homes. More recently, have used a Brookstone digital unit that just died. So I ordered the Dohm-dual speed with a happy recollection of the Hammacher similar unit, but this Dohm unit is MUCH too loud, even on the ""low"" setting. Anywhere in the bedroom. So I returned it for inconsistency with the webpage description. Have moved on to theMarpac TSC 330 Travel Sound Conditioner, and it is great; excellent volume and sound adjustments."
3,"Constant sound, but not loud enough","If you have a lot of ambient noise that you need to drown out (like a screaming toddler or an outdoor lawnmower, etc.) this is not the machine for you. It's better to just put up the cash for an ecotones sleep machine. I didn't want to spend that much, so I bought this model, but my baby still wakes up since this model isn't loud enough to drown out loud noises. The ecotones has adjustable noise levels that make it ideal. This machine is great for what it is (constant white noise), it's just not loud enough."
5,Bought for the Baby then had to buy one for us!,"Best white noise I have found. We tried apps on the phone, recordings, etc. My son still sleeps to an ""ocean wave"" recording on an ipod that we have going in a loop. When our daughter was born last month we decided to try something different. This machine creates a perfect negative noise that you stop hearing after a couple minutes. I am not sure the lower speed on the variable version was necessary as we only use the higher speed. I do like that you can change the body to alter the pitch of the sound to customize to your liking. We just bought this one for our bedroom because the baby moved out and we went through ""white noise maching withdraw."""
1,Makes a strange mechanical noise,"When I received my Dohm and plugged it in, it definitely made the white noise sound. But if you are sensitive to noise or have exceptionally good hearing, you may notice this also makes a sort of mechanical ""whirr"" sound that is very unsettling. I returned the item and just bought a small clip fan instead - works much better."
5,Still working well after ~5 years of nightly use,"We use this every night to drown out city, pet, and spouse noises. Works great. Had to take it apart and clean out dust once."
4,mar pac white noise,"Recently punched the Marpac Sound Conditioner and am very pleased with it. I believe the sound of waterfalls or birds chirping wouldnot be soporific, but the sh-h-h-h of the white noise works fine to mask unwanted sounds."
2,Broke Down the 1st Day,"In fact, this machine stopped working within a few hours. When it was working it provided a decent noise level but whithin a few hours it just went dead. I sent it back for a replacement hoping that the new one would actually work."
5,good product,just what i needed for backgroud. good item. happy to have it and it was delivered as i expected. thanks
3,Great sound but NOWHERE NEAR LOUD ENOUGH!!!,"Wow, after all the great reviews of this product I assumed it was going to be perfect. The sound coming from it is very nice HOWEVER not nearly loud enough for use as a white noise machine for our baby nursery. In our son's room we use a Bose radio/cd player set on a vacant station and its perfect except sometimes the station will come through during a storm. I was looking for something loud, more portable, and more dependable than the bose. Im disappointed this wasnt our solution. I wish it was because I do like the sound. Oh well, the search continues...."
4,"Well, it makes noise to cancel out other noise.","I got this to help down out the sounds I anticipated would come from an adjoining office that was in the process of being occupied. However, that office did not get occupied. I have tried it out, though, and it is sitting next to my printer against the waiting-to-offend wall separating me from the other office just waiting to do it's job.Basically, this think has two fans inside it that create a noise that is supposed to down out other noises. It doesn't actually ""void"" the other noises. It just sort of overpowers them without being too annoying.Will it work for you? I don't know. Try it, and see. If it doesn't, send it back."
2,Loud clanking noise...,"I bought this item for my infant sons nursery, he slept with us for 6 months and was quite used to our sound conditioner. My Mom purchased one for her house and it worked really well. We used ours for about a month before it started making an annoying clanking noise. The only way I can stop this noise is by turning the unit on its side or placing a towel under it so it is at an angle. When I have it on its side it is very slow to start up and sometimes will only work in the faster mode. I am sure it is not designed to work on its side but the clanking noise is horrible. The idea is to cancel out noise and create a calming white noise- so disappointed in this product. I would have returned it but it was already out of its return period by the time the problem occurred."
3,Choose your reseller wisely....,"I ordered from Pro Therapy as the Amazon reseller and thought I'd provide a heads up to fellow customers who are considering ordering and simply returning if they don't care for this version of a noise machine.If you are not satisfied with your order, you will be responsible not only for the return shipping, but a restocking fee. Also, even if the orginal delivery was free, you will be charged for the delivery after the fact if you are disatisfied with the product. My $40 product will cost me $15 to return. ONLY order if you are sure you won't need to exchange or return your selection.Personally this wasn't a good fit for the office enviroment I was hoping to quiet down, but it's worth a try if you find the right reseller- just not Pro Therapy Supplies!"
2,Depends on your Noise Issue - No Good for Cubicles,"I bought one to help deal with the folks at work. I sit in a cubicle all day and was about to loose it listening to all the loud, click-clack keyboards, mouse clicking and scrolling, phone conversations, bad eating manners and etc. It was suggested that I get a white noise machine. Well.....it didn't help. You can still hear everything that you wish you didn't have to listen to all day. It sounds like a loud fan running and I agree with the woman that said that the design/color is just awful. I had to hide the machine on my desk to prevent the starring as people walked by."
2,Not what I had hoped for,I purchased this item hoping it was similar in sound to a vaccum or hair dryer to help my 1 month old daughter sleep. Instead it sounded like the soft hum of a fan. Not near loud enough or high enough in pitch to make a difference in her abiity to sleep. The machine did work when I plugged it in. It just wasn't what I was looking for.
2,"It would work, but.....","This product does make a pleasant backround noise similar to a fan, but it also has a horrible metallic rattling noise that is enough to drive you crazy. Unfortunately, the rattle is so obvious it was all I could focus on--worse than nails on a chalkboard!!"
3,nice deal,"This was what it was advertised to be. However, it did not solve my problems with sleeping. Nothing wrong with this product. It certainly does what it was advertised to do."
3,Works ok,"I have noisy neighbors at home and at work, and this machine does help somewhat. If you are trying to muffle really loud voices you might be disappointed--it helps, but does not completely cover the sound."
3,This noise maker makes too much noise!,"Bought it to drown out road noise and the sound of the TV, husband snoring, etc., so my son could sleep. Unfortunately, after burying it in a closet on the lowest setting, it still made way too much noise so I've had to just turn it off and continue my search."
5,Sweet dreams!,"I'm a light sleeper, and tend to awake at the slightest noise. This wonderful machine provides a light cover for most of those creaks and bumps in the night. No, it doesn't completely mask my husband's occasional snoring, but it does cover up the majority of intermittent snorks and stuff that used to jolt me awake. It has really helped me get a better night's rest. I don't want to be without it!!"
2,Not as expected,"I purchased this item when it was the ""Deal of the Day"" on Amazon. I was excited to try it as I'm one of the people who sleeps well during summer when the AC is humming at night. I was excited when it arrived, only to find that it makes a noisy motor sound which even the white noise of the air rush cannot hide. I've tried it at various air rush vent positions, but the noise of operation still comes through. It's loud enough to make the machiine useless for sleep. I sent an email to the company asking if this was normal, and even though they state on their web page that they will get back to your email within 48 hours, I still have had no response. That was several weeks ago and I have still had no response from them, either by phone or email. I was very disappointed with this item and at almost $50., it was not worth the money since it does not function as described. I doubt, the noise coming from this machine, would not help anyone sleep."
5,USA!,Works great! MADE IN USA!!! I snore and the wife loves it. Blocks out sounds of trains too. Just love it
3,Limited Nudity,"Some good nudity during the first half, even some full frontal. The rest of the movie is all suggestive and skimpy outfits. I expected way more nudity. The naked girls were hot though. Its everything else you would expect from a low budget b-movie."
4,A Fascinating Glimpse of Life in Urban Atlanta,"I really enjoyed reading this book! The narrative held my interest to the very end and I was left with wanting to know more about all of his neighbors and what happened to his neighborhood since then. I agree with Maxine Chernoff's review of this book in which she states ""James Gallant writes with humor, sympathy, and candor about what really happens in the American urban limbo of big and small-time swindlers chasing a dream. From con-artistry and hoodoo practices, to lonely old ladies, conniving pimps and chartreuse houses, Gallant's Atlanta is a complex and charming place worthy of the legendary status it achieves through his magically affirmative writing."" I couldn't have said it any better than she did!"
4,Very good music by a promising contemporary composer,"I was very impressed with much of the music on this disc. Ms. Bouchard is certainly a very gifted composer whose propensity for creating strange, almost alien structures is amazing. She doesn't use what could be called true melodies as much as pulses of notes strangely independent from each other. There's a kind fluidity to her music as if every note is a drop in a ethereal sea--quite facinating. The title work as well as ""Eternity"" are real gems; it's worth buying the CD just for them. Unfortunately, ""Songs for an Acrobat"" left me somewhat unsatisfied. Not to say that it's a bad work, but I'm just not able to get excited about it. Yet this CD is still definitely worth the price, I highly recommend it."
5,Ukrainians read it too!!!,"I'm a teacher of English in Ukraine. So I read it with my adult students. It was some kind of good language practice for them. We enjoyed reading it, trying to imagine the characters.It's great to read it together with you!!!"
3,Interesting film,"I gave three stars to this film for some of the acting - some was excellent (Evan Adams deserves an award) and others somewhat lame. I like Sherman Alexie's movie renditions of his writing, as it always stirs up some creativity for me, yet I felt it veered too strongly on the side of negatively portraying Indian people. Sure, a lot of this happens. A lot of amazingly good things happen too that don't seem to get time in his movies."
4,Excellent film with a few rough edges,"This film is much sharper, satirical and real than Alexie's first text to video adaptation Smoke Signals. So if you liked Smoke Signals, certain themes are carried over and one of the actors, Evan (Thomas Builds-A-Fire) come to Business of Fancydancing. However, don't expect obvious and repitious themes. Alexie has chosen to mimic the episodic format of his poetry to the film and the themes are centered around more of a cyclical than linear format. Overall, an excellent film. The DVD edition is particularly wonderful for its deleted scenes and the option to have commentary by Sherman Alexie and Evan running throughout the film--I would suggest watching it after you've seen the film."
3,Pretty good,Gift to my mom but don't know how long the band lasts but the watch is really suitable to old people.
5,Why conservatives and liberals alike love and hate this book,"Using accurate, verified documentation, confirmed by subsequent Congressional hearings, Douglass, a career NSA employee and US War College professor, records the 1960s Soviet buildup of South American drug cartels and their infrastructure. The goals were to obtain funding for local wars of liberation, destabilize the US military, US inner cities and youth with drugs, and compromise South American politicians. Ironically, liberals sometimes like this information, as it provides a clear rationale for the US countermeasures, which allegedly included similar tactics."
1,"Paranoid, scantily documented screed","My title says it all. Douglass's frequent use of the passive voice allows him to present such an innocent and wide-eyed yet wildly paranoid account of the cause of the drug epidemic in the West. His ""documentation"" largely consists of cobbled-together newspaper articles and dubious material from various sources. The main thrust of the book is ""evidenced"" by an account by General Sejna, which of course requires no real documentation. I wonder if Mr. Douglass has heard of Pablo Escobar or any other prominent drug kingpins who actually facilitated the drug epidemic. By Douglass's account, the commies nearly shoved drugs down the throats of the innocent, wide-eyed American youth. Yet even more laughable is his argument that the second wave of feminism was fueled by similar communist machinations. Oh, and I love that Douglass provided a rating for his OWN BOOK here, very objectively giving it a 5 star rating. Pass on this one folks."
5,Earth 2 The Complete series,"I had watched parts of this series and enjoyed it,when i saw it onsale at amazon i bought them right away.Is very enjoyable series to watch,will watch this several times through the years and look forward to it.Alot of movies i buy i will watch 1 maybe 2 times and then never again.Not so with earth 2 will always enjoy this."
4,Good old fashioned Sci Fi,This story was ahead of it's time and is still good to watch today. Such a shame the TV company pulled the plug on it.
2,Disappointed,"As a big sci-fi fan I read all the reviews of this series and gave it a go. Perhaps this is good family entertainment, but overall I found it to be boring, especially after series like Firefly or FarScape, both of which were geared toward an older audience. The storyline had a lot of potential, but as they included children among the cast I found it to be mundane. Probably great for family viewing, but more like ""Buck Rogers in the 21st Century""."
1,Not Worth It,"Awful! This could have been a good show, but instead they let this show get worse toward the end of the season. The episodes are way out of order on the discs, which will leave you even more confused."
2,"Cheesy is, as Cheesy does","The pilot is a good effort with a nice budget and an okay story. But it becomes clear that this is going to take place on a desolate world with no flashy space scenes or sets that make up part of the imaginary experience of sci-fi.Yes, in the desert traveling with the occassional masked alien. Sci-fi junkies should immediately know what I'm talking about. But okay, so how's the story? Eh, so so. It was given a decent effort though remains pretty cheesy. It is now over 11 years old as well. A bit dated and corny.Sorry fans, spend your money on Stargate and Deep Space instead."
2,Near Miss Ruined by the Suits,"I watched it for awhile but couldn't get into it. Never did understand why, if the government didn't want their colony to succeed, it didn't simply set off the bomb aboard the ship halfway there instead of waiting for them to land. The ""Wagon Train"" storyline with thinly-disguised Indians and ""Guest Starring this Episode"" humans popping up out of nowhere threw me off. Tim Curry's character's fascination with that early-teenage girl creeped me out so I dropped it.In the end it was just a group of very good actors making the best of very poor scripts until the checks stopped coming. Not much actual ""science fiction"", a whole lot of improbable coincidences cobbled together to make up shows."
3,the scifi experience,"earth 2 was a short lived series that few seen or maybe even heard of but i think that it was adescently written show and thecharacters grew on you.i couldnt imagine going through what they went through on a daily basis,if in our wildest dreams could become a true story....ahhhhh but its scifi....i guess my only dissapointment was that the show never had an ending because of the short lived series,so you never no what happens to them and if they ever reach there destination."
4,stories that hold up well over time,"I really enjoyed this series when it was on and I was so excited to see it out in DVD. Too bad though we couldn't have had more adventures of the colonists. I'm in the midst of watching the DVD's and finding I still enjoy the show and the interesting storylines. I've grown attached to the characters and would like to see what happens to them all. Alas they never got to finish their story, but meanwhile I'll enjoy what I can get."
3,"Great Show, Poor DVD Assembly","To those who remember and enjoyed this show this is a great day, to savor it finally coming out on DVD, with that being said you can tell by the packaging and lack of thought put into the DVD's themselves that those who did it were in a hurry and didn't care. The show itself I would give 4 1/2 stars, the DVD's and packaging I'd give 2 stars. In the set that I bought one of the fasteners that hold in the DVD was broken and the way the discs are stacked on each other can cause problems. The DVD's themselves hold very little extras besides some outtakes and deleted scenes, and the last 3 episodes on the DVD are very much out of order, almost as an afterthought that they were included, one of the last should have been near the beginning of the series. There seem to be glitchs in the discs themselves too, that being said, if you just want to enjoy a good story and show then you are in luck, because that's what it is, nothing fancy just a good tale of survival."
4,I used to be addicted to this show,"I was never really interested in this show's overall plot (it didn't seem like the writers were either), but what I liked about it was the characters. You had two groups of people: The super-serious scientist types who were always making decisions for everyone, and the cool people who would more or less ignore thier decisions and do whatever they felt like. This usually led to serious consequences, and that was the plot of most episodes. I always liked the cool folks, even though they continually screwed everything up. They were really human characters and really sympathetic. They weren't cardboard cutouts of ""good"" people like Star Trek, and that was the best thing about the show.I'm glad it's finally coming out on DVD. I'll definitely pick it up. I miss those folks!"
4,Interesting series,"I was definitely interested in this series, there were a few blunders along the way, they spent WAY too much time at the base camp they established halfway through the season, they should've moved on with it. The characters were engaging (although both my wife and I were starting to get impatient with the little girl's ignorance in her interaction with Gaal/Tim Curry early on in the season. The 2 episodes they threw in at the end should have been chronologically placed within the series instead of just tossing them in, at the end, as an afterthought.All in all, my wife and I enjoyed this series, it should have been allowed to continue. -kd5-"
3,"Go West, young space pioneers!","Not a bad series but not one of my favorites. It is much like a western about settlers moving west with high-tech stuff that's mostly not all that high tech. Even the native species seem a bit ""old west"". Despite that it's not a bad story and parts are quite interesting. Beware of the packaging, the disks are poorly marked and the order is not standard, so be sure you're putting the right disk in."
2,Defective Disc,"I received the DVDs in a very timely fashion. The discs are two-sided, which is fine, but side A on disc two simply will not register on any DVD player, so I have missed 3 of the 6 shows on that disc. I hope the same does not hold true for any other discs. That is why I have given it two stars. The program itself isn't great, but not the worse I've seen."
4,DVD itself,Love the series. The issue I have is with the physical DVD #2 Show #2. There is a bad spot on it that I have to fast forward through. Almost like one very used from a rental store occasionally gets. :-(
3,TV show,I was looking for planet earth TV series and found this one. This show I had seen a long time ago when it was on the TV but missed major parts of it. I am enjoying the full series and am glad I got it.
4,"Strangely Engrossing, Too Bad It Died","Really nothing more to add except that the final three episodes appear to have been aired out of the chronological order of the series - ""All About Eve,"" ""Natural Born Grendlers,"" & ""Flower Child."" Watching ""AAE"" and ""FC"" in the order the DVDs present them is really not a problem, but ""Natural Born Grendlers"" introduces the ""geolock,"" something that plays a prominent role in the ""Better Living Through Morganite, Parts 1 & 2."" Thus, I would recommend viewers skip to ""NBG"" before continuing to the ""BLTM"" episodes.Otherwise, a strangely engrossing and compelling series. With the success of Sci-Fi Channel's (an NBC channel) ""Sci-Fi Friday,"" maybe NBC suits will consider reviving the series on Sci-Fi. I'm certain there would be an appreciative audience."
4,Great Series...bad order...,"I was excited that Earth 2 was out on DVD, and immediately had to buy it! I had weirdly thought it was two seasons, but oddly the amount of storyline was only one season. The only thing that sucks is that when they put the DVDs together they put it in the order it ended up being shown in b/c of football and various sports shows that interrupted the show order, so in the DVD set there are two eps that should be at the beginning of the show that are on the DVD at the end AFTER the finale...odd...but still a great buy!"
4,Survival of the Fittest ... or Whoever Ends Up on the Boat,"It had been more than 10 years since I'd seen this show. I had to buy the DVD set to remember what it was I liked so much. It wasn't a specific actor, it wasn't a specific story, it was the feel of the show. There's something about human survival that is so compelling."
3,Okay,Average series which was ruined by the last few shows. It it was given a chance it probably would have gotten better. The writing was good but story development needed more work (and more time).
1,poor actors and direction,"The idea and story are originaly great, but choosing of actors is poor also not such a good direction."
2,I can understand now why it was canceled,"I saw only the first episode on British SKYTV (I live in Germany), and had never seen the other episodes. The first episode had promise. However, as I have viewed the remaining episodes on DVD I find the series to have mundane writing, uninteresting characters and slow moving, uninteresting plots. There are several points in the show where the characters talk, but make no sense (too numerous to list). Don't feel like enough was revealed about the backstory. Have no clue how long the days were. Boring!!!!!"
2,Money refunded/ could not deliver DVD,Although seller was unable to complete purchase I did receive a timely refund.
4,A show that went off to early,"Admittedly this is no Firefly, a stellar standout show but Earth 2 was interesting and had potential. It should have been given a chance to last more than one season, so I'm glad to see it FINALLY come to dvd. I am looking forward to watching over again and getting reacquainted with the story!"
4,Another one cancelled before it's time...,"I thought this was a great series that was cancelled before its time. The majority of the episodes were very interesting with a few that sucked (as with any series). It was original and had intriguing, complex characters.I am giving it a 4 because of the lack of special features. All it had were some delted/extended scenes and outtakes, as well as commercials for other series put out by the studio. The actual television show rates a 5 for originality and the creation of characters you care about and can identify with."
3,Earth 2 complete series,"Great story. Order of episodes is a bit weird, though. Disc 1 sticks at same place every time, too."
3,ugh,"Well I ordered ths show, because i loved it as a kid. It said it would be the complete series, but several episodes were left out, and they were not in chronological order."
1,Great show.......lousy pkg. abd disc quality,"I loved this show and was excited to get all the episodes on DVD. The set offers few extra features, which is a disappointment. Also the episodes are in order of airdate, so the continuity of story is OFF. AND the discs were defective in two sets. I finally gave up on the whole thing. Overall a disappointment."
4,Worked GREAT at a GREAT price,"Fits just fine to my approx 14"" older RV roof vent/skylight. I would NOT splurge on the other costly ones, just go for this one. It's a great price and does the job."
4,Godzilla Action Figure,"Nice action figure, but tail comes off often, easy enough to replace but annoying.."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm a HUGE Joe Sample fan, but I was disappointed by this CD. It's very raw and somewhat jarring at times. If you like early / rag time jazz, this might be of interest to you. For a truly outstanding Sample experience Invitation is a must - his 1993 release which might be the finest jazz CD of the past 20 years. Other excellent outings include Old Faces, Old Places, The Pecan Tree, and Ashes to Ashes."
2,Not nessecary,"If you have problems to fall asleep, this might be the right Cd for you. But if you like to hear Joe Sampleas you are used to him, forget it. I think he has made this record alone for his own pleasure. I only give two stars because he is Joe Sample."
4,Great Deal,"The color was a little lighter than I wanted, it was like a smokey dark blue not a bright navy but it feels great and is the perfect size. My boyfriend really likes it too. For the money its a great deal for a great product."
4,Cat friendly material,"If you have a pair of long-haired, fluffy-in-the-winter cats like we do, you'll like this microsuede. I ordered the Olive colored duvet, and there isn't a sign that my cats ever nap on the bed. (Any cat hair shakes right off.)My only complaint that might sway me towards a different duvet in the future, is that I would have liked the underside to be made out of something more tactile than thin polyester nylon.Overall, the stitching looks fine and it looks like it will hold up to washings well."
2,shoddy workmanship,the button holes on this duvet cover are all sewn shut - kind of pointless...not to mention annoying & not what i expected....i guess this is a case of getting what you pay for-
2,Its shrinking!,"My boyfriend and I bought this because we needed a cover quickly. Fast shipping was impressive. The smell coming from it was also impressive but not in a good way. We put it on our bed and loved the weight and feel of it. We were quite happy. Of course its been a month now and we pull feathers out of our hair every morning. The weight is no longer there because we have started a ""down collection"" next to the bed. Its sad its so cheap because we really liked it when it was new. I guess its just a disposable. Use it for a few months and get a new one. Oh well I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,Microsuede Duvet,"excellant quality, love the feel and it looks great on my bed! I am very pleased with it in everyway and the price was great!"
3,"Top is great, bottom silky and slides","I love the rich feel of the top of this cover but I hate the backing made of a slippery silk material. I wake up to find my blankets almost on the floor! I think I'm gonna try and tack little spongey material cut into circles and sew/tack them on that silky back side and see if that works. I bet everyone else is having the same problem. I haven't tried to wash it yet so I can't comment on that, maybe someone else has?"
5,good value for price,bought for guest room spare sheet set. good texture and retains texture even when washed multiple times.
3,Not as I expected.,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. The material looked more stiff and thin that I had expected from the picture. But it felt alright, I wasn't impressed by it."
3,MINOR SHERLOCK ENTRY,"Excellent cast, save a lackluster Dr. Watson, in a so-so Sherlock Holmes mystery based loosely on Conan Doyle's original title. The film is old and creaky and refuses the high psychological logic of Sherlock Holmes' perfect science in a few apparent plot holes, but the supporting cast is exceptional, and although star Reginald Owen's Sherlock leans a little closer to Perry Mason, he quite fits the shoes of the famed detective."
2,More Hollywood than Holmes,"More Hollywood than Holmes, 1 Dec 20071932's A Study in Scarlet is a creaky Sherlock Holmes movie shot in California with a predominantly American cast and only a passing relation to the novel. Reginald Owen just about gets by as Holmes, but he's an insufferable know-all in the script who makes pronouncements of guilt without ever once being required to explain the deductions that led to them: people just blindly accept his word because, well, he's Sherlock Holmes. Anna May Wong at her worst makes for a poor femme fatale, Warburton Gamble makes an anonymous Watson and even Alan Mowbray, playing sober for a change, isn't able to liven up Lestrade. Eminently missable, especially in this ropey public domain DVD transfer."
3,Too expensive for what they are...,We opted against these (the only piece of the set that we did not get) because they are just too expensive. Granted they are a nice look but I was able to purchase 4 matching custom pieces off of EBay that looked better and were cheaper ($9.99 per set of 2). Plus the colors on these looked a little muted next to the quilt.
2,TALK TRUMPS PERFORMANCE,"If you are expecting video clips of the essential performers of the Lighthouse All Stars era then I would suggest you look elsewhere. Perhaps five of the eighty minutes could be considered performance video. Most doesn't include the Lighthouse All Star key players in any significant way and mostly only pieces of tunes. I believe this was a missed opportunity to present a major video representation of West Coast Jazz performance. However, if your interest is in an abundance of talk about something you can neither see nor hear this may be the DVD for you. However you will see some snapshots, a few excellent Bill Claxton photographs, but a lot more album covers of the variety you can see in used LP venues. Howard Rumsey, the bassist with most of the Lighthouse All Star recordings, provides a running history on how the Lighthouse evolved."
4,For beginners of Tibetan language studies,This dicionary is a useful tool for beginners of Tibetan language study.
1,Spicy World Fennel Seeds,"Caution in purchasing this product!Found foreign matter in package, had to throw away."
5,"Fashion, Music and Community--Hollywood Style:Wow!","Impressions is simply a great read. Hollywood was essentially ground-zero for Change in the 1970's, and Melanie Onofrio-Haug has captured the best of it with humor, personality and a writing style that has rhythm reminiscent of the times themselves.This is adolescence at its finest. A First Job takes a whole new twist when it is on Sunset Boulevard. Music is more intense when it can be gotten down the street from your highschool. And teen fashion never seemed so fine: ""velvets, satin, Lurex, lame in every color of the rainbow, silver and gold lame jackets, and rhinestones...all teetering atop 7 inch platforms.""This is certainly one of the best books of the summer."
4,Crazy Dictators,The author presented an excellent depiction of three unbalanced African dictators. More Americans should purchase and read this work because we need to learn more about history so that we can select our own politicians carefully. Most politicians worldwide share certain characteristics. It's smart to build up knowledge that will give us the necessary insight to identify which characteristics lead to real trouble.
2,Not as good as picture,"The diamond is not sparkling. These earrings are beautiful in the picture, yet not when you put them on."
4,good,I like the stories and I love the pictures. I always try to paint them. The pictures are my favorite part.
4,Excellent book for readers intruged to learn about horses,"Very good book, I own it. Excellent information at hand at any time. Origins, colors, uses and more of each breed. Just not enough color and I think it is a bit too long written for younger riders and horse lovers alike. Otherwise it would have gotten five stars for older enthusiasts but four is quite well overall."
5,This book is pretty cool.,"I like the informative yet simple format of this book, but on many of the pictures (most notably the Lippizaner), tthe horses are pearlized with pastel colors. What's up with that, anyways?!"
3,Pretty but...,"This book has beautifully painted pictures, so I liked it being an artist. If you're not really interested in oil paintings of horses, and stories you may have already heard I don't suggest buying this book."
2,Not what I expected,"When I bought this book, it looked pretty good and since it had more than a hundred pages, i thought i would enjoy it but i didnt.This book starts of with a story of a horse, then goes into some boring history. You dont get very many good facts from this book, so if you are looking for a book that has a lot of facts about horses in it, dont buy this one!"
3,"Paid for expedited, late","The book is in great shape. But I paid for expedited delivery(cost more than I paid for the book) and received nearly 2 weeks later. I had received an email from them saying I would receive it in 3 - 5 days right after I ordered. I emailed this company to find out where my book was, and they never answered me back."
2,If you are an old Tricky Fan Beware,"I bought this album cause I have always loved hearing tricky albums, but I was really shocked and dissapointed with this latest effort. If you are an old tricky fan this album I would recomend listening to first cause it is definetly alot different. Maybe he will get some new fans out of it, cause I know I will be selling this disc."
2,Instantly forgettable,"Consistently struggling against utter mediocrity (I literally think the extended fadeout on the final track may be the only slice of life found on the entire disc), this sluggish trip-hop has nothing but redundant posturing going for it."
2,not impressed,"Tricky's last album blowback definately wasnt his greatest, but it was definately one of his most eclectic. He used so many influences, from the Red hot Chili Peppers, to the singer from Live, and mixed it all together for unfortunately half baked results. But this album is almost like a return to his roots, using only one vocalist throughout the whole album- but the album sounds very repetitive. EVeryones asking for another maxinquaye and he still's not givin it to us. But im sure its hard to repeat that. The beats on this album sound very repetitive and doesnt even really sound too much like an album where the beats are supposed to be everything. Its just like background beats- nothing special. His beats are supposed to make up for his voice which he can't do much with. If youre an avid fan, buy it, because you all are probably the only ones that are actually buying the album. I dont htink this album even charted. (besides the electronica chart) but it is a definate disappointemnt."
2,What was he thinking?,"There are about 2 good tracks on this whole album, one of which is a cover of a Cure song (The Lovecats). The rest of the tracks are nearly indistinguishable from one another, and completely forgettable. Sounds like a 'sell-out' attempt, but it didn't even work. Tricky's weakest album to date."
4,The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing,"Anyone who likes stories based on true events should like this movie. It has a very good cast, and is comprehensible inthe plot and substance."
2,Shallow,"The story depicted in the movie is fairly accurate, except for the trial at the end, but it never goes beneath the surface, never even tries to tell who the three main characters were or why they acted as they did. All we are told is that Harry Thaw was crazy, Stanford White was sort of an innocent victim, and Evelyn Nesbit was pretty. It wasn't enough.The murder of White is, in my view, the most interesting crime of the 20th century, and this movie turns it into just another killing. The true story had everything: a gorgeous girl, raw sex, lechery, madness, wealth, and jealousy. There are several good books on the subject, and at least one other movie does a better job of telling the story.As for acting, Joan Collins couldn't and the others didn't. The sets and Cinemascope photography are lush, but they don't make up for the acting and directing flaws."
3,GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING,"One of Farley Granger's best performances highlights this period drama of the Evelyn Nesbit/Harry K. Thaw/Stanford White love and murder triangle. It was an early Cinemascope picture, full of vivid color; i hope the product description is in error when it says they've released it in full screen. If so, don't waste your money; it shows in a letterboxed version of the Fox Movie channel - watch that instead. Otherwise, an interesting, neglected film."
3,Way Off Base!,"I am surprised that Evelyn Nesbit gave the green light for this script. She did visit the set (and was paid for story rights), and later her only complaint was that Joan Collins was too British and too busty to play her.Good grief Evelyn! They changed the facts of the story to Evelyn seducing Stanford White! For godsake, he raped her when she was 16 yr old and passed out from drinking champagne. This movie has him as the victim!And the movie portrays her mother, and mother-in-law as being kindly women. In reality, her mother through parental neglect (and being financially subsidized by White) allowed White the opportunity to rape Evelyn, and Mrs. Thaw hated Evelyn all of her life.But -- Joan Collins does have a good resemblance to Evelyn, and the costumes are historically accurate. For that the film gets 3 stars."
3,The Girl In The Red Velvet Swing,"The film is OK.The story of jealousy and forbidden love.Joan Collins who plays Evelyn Nesbit is very young and beatiful in this film and she has eyes for older, suave Stanford White (Ray Milland) Despite White's marriage and their significant age difference, the become secret lovers until White decide it's over.Evelyn marries Harry K. Thaw...a competitor of White's.But haunted by his new wife's past,Thaw won't rest until he makes sure he's the only man in her life!.Not a great film but it is based on a true story and the actors are very good."
2,Not one of the best,"My granddaughers love Calico Critters and own numerous pieces. But this isn't one of the better ones. The cradle broke immediately. Some of the other pieces are quite small, too small really. Other sets are more fun. This one got set to the side pretty quickly."
2,The Lion King Special Edition,"If I had had the opportunity to listen to this CD I would not have bought it. I did/do like the Elton John songs(not his best,I must say)just OK."
5,Great CD,I got the CD as a gift for my girlfriend and she has been playing the CD non-stop since Valentines.
3,The Lion King: Special Edition,"It's a good cd, but . . . . I read the reviews before I bought it and some of them mentioned that the extra Elton John songs were not reason enough to buy the special edition. Being an Elton John fan, I bought it anyway. What I was disappointed in is that there are many original songs from the movie that were cut out of this addition. I think I'll still try to find the original Disney cartoon version with ALL the songs from the movie."
2,Very weak.,"Elton John and Hans Zimmer do not a good scoring couple make. Definitely not. This CD has some very bad and uninteresting songs on it and I really hate that 'Circle of Life' tune. Plus, there are only 4 tracks devoted to Zimmer entirely. He won an Academy Award for this music yet they only give him 4 tracks worth of space?!?The only one worth listening to is 'To Die For' which sounds pretty cool but is without theme or control. Nothing much on this CD interests at all I'm afraid to say. It's all too bland and unspectacular and badly arranged to boot.Get the soundtrack to 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron' for some way cool Zimmer music and a great partnership with Bryan Adams. Avoid this 'un."
3,LION KING!!,oh yes...just becuase i danced to all their music when i was 5 and cryed every time i saw the movie..i think i loved that movie. but really? music for elton john..who would want to listen to that bloody old bloke singing on a childerns album? not i!
1,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...dull pop fluff from Elton and beyond his songs it's karaoke sing-a-long. Skip this and find the Elton songs on a greatest hits package unless you have kids who love karaoke and the movie.
5,A short review,"Music is wonderful, with a awesome mood. It makes much of the movie, and works just as well on its own."
5,the best soundtrack of all time,"first off, its music was written by Elton John, so immediately, that should spark some respect for the album. the lion king has always been one of my all time faves and this CD is simply amazing. from start to finish. you just can't go wrong w/two versions of the song ""circle of life"" and the cute ""i can't wait to be king"" and ""hakuna matata"". it doesn't matter if you're 10 or 30, when something is good, it's good. and this is REAL music. whether it be the instrumental pieces or the three tracks at the end performed by Elton John himself, this is something that deserves the recognition. Unlike everything else polluting the air waves today, this is QUALITY music. this has real meaning and talent."
5,A fantastic presentation of each song presented in the movie,"this cd provides the listener with each enchanting song from the movie, the lion king. with a blend of elton john's soft rock renditions and the original versions of ""can you feel the love tonight"" and ""the circle of life"", this cd is by far the best soundtrack for a disney movie. You will fall in love with the music once again, and have a sudden urge to watch the movie. 5 stars!!!"
5,Great,I knew what to expect and I was glad with what I got! Love all the songs and the different versions! It arrived extremely fast as well!
4,My Kids Love It,"I was able to pick this up on one of their monthly sales. My kids love it when I put it on in my car (their mom usually gets the DVD player). I am not ashamed to say, I find myself singing along with them. I love Elton John, but find him to be the weak link of this selection. My kids (and I in particular) love the actual songs that were played in the movie. Overall, a great soundtrack."
4,lion king,"It was a Christmas gift for my girls. They have not listen to it yet, but they have put into their computer."
3,pretty nifty..........,it was cool i have the movie the sound track its ok but can sum times be ANNOYING
4,Nostalgic,"This soundtrack takes you back to when you saw the movie. It's upbeat, and my favorite, of course, is the opening ""The Circle of Life"", which is very powerful. It's just a collection of all the tunes in the movie, and Elton John performs some of the songs he wrote."
3,Good one to keep if you like Disney music!!,"I don't think this is a top quality Disney CD, but I really like the variety of music in this CD: playful(Hakuna Matata), emotional (Can You Feel the Love Tonight), fearful (To Die For), scarry (Be Prepared), and so forth. I like more than half of the music collected in this CD, therefore, I think it's a good one to keep! However, I'm not so impress about the instrumental performances in this CD, I think Pocahantus sound track did a much better job in these aspects."
2,Mediocre at best,"We've finally reached the point where people can't tell the good from the bad from the average. This soundtrack has a few good tunes but is mostly soft rock (or soft rock derived) pablum. Go back and listen to ""Mary Poppins"" or the ""Jungle Book"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" if you want quality Disney music."
2,Worth buying.....,"But easy to get tired of, however. Elton John adds some appeal. Has some enjoyable African themes. This album does not do justice to what composer Hans Zimmer is really capable of (see The Power of One). Disney can, and has, done better in the soundtrack area. Overall, this is an enjoyable album, but not musically superior."
3,Hit and miss,"I bought this cd because it has the song ""Girls"" which was used in the film ""Lost In Translation"". I found that track to be a lovely mix of soothing voices and modern rock sounds. The rest of the album has moments that are just as good if not better, but it also has moments that don't work well. The collaboration with Liam Gallagher on the title track is cool as well as tracks 6 and 10 which feature a very nice female vocalist who you can't really comprehend lyrically. The opening track ""Leather"" is an upbeat intro and gets the album going on an engaging start. Track 3 ""Hands Around My Throat"" kind of ruins it for me though. Not much to that one. Unfortunately, the others I haven't mentioned also fall into that category which makes this a 50% listenable experience. I don't know that I could truly reccommend this unless you blow money on music frequently. Nothing amazing on this disc."
4,Death in Vegas still alive,"That this album still sounds fresh is testimony to it's quality. Do yourself a favour, if you don't have it - buy it just to hear Liam Gallagher's snarl. One of my favourite records and an essential in my view"
3,3 1/2 Stars For 4 Tracks,"As a fan of bands such as Portishead and Massive Attack I bought this album basically for three tracks which were Hands Around My Throat, Girls, and 23 Lies. -All excellent songs and I expected the rest of the cd to resemble them but that was horribly erroneous. When I got to track eight I just about had enough; honestly I couldn't help but laugh at how bad the rest of this album was turning out. Fortunately when track nine (Diving Horses) flipped on I was relieved and once again glad I had purchased this album. Turns out Diving Horses is, if not their best song, definately one of them. This was my first Death in Vegas album and after seeing their ""diversity"" this will also probably be my last. Don't get me wrong I can appriciate some diversity but when an album goes from songs like 23 Lies to Scorpio Rising or So You Say You Lost Your Baby to Diving Horses then it's time to stop buying their entire albums and start downloading individual songs."
4,If you like Death in Vegas - probably their best,"love the female vocalists they utilize, hope sandoval being one. . . . . . . . . . ."
5,"Muzik (A..A..),occult classic by Death in Vegas","Title comes from a motion picture by Kenneth Anger. Album art work is stills from the film. Alas! there is no photo of a topless Milli Small singing My Boy Lollipop before a crowd of young men engaged in an orgy,the song is not on this cd, but one cannot have everthing. The music is super, half instrumental half vocals. Singers include Liam Gallagher(Oasis)Paul Weller(the Jam).If you give this cd to a Scorpio on their bithday you'll see their personality literally transform into an eagle right before your eyes. They might even smile. Flattery will get you most anything.Anyway, you'll make their day. This is one of the best cd's of the new millinium.Very Very eclectic. Brilliant of the group to salute Kenneth Anger: also,recommended Lucifer Rising soundtrack.Favorite cuts;Leather/Girls/Hands Around My Throat/23 Lies(banjos and ragas from the Indian subcontinent,how marvelous. I'm running out of superalitives. Enjoy!Happy Birthday,Scorpio."
5,How I became a Metric Master in 29 Days!,"From the man who brought you such great titles as ""Protect Groundwater"" and ""The Chocolate Syrup Experiment,"" comes a witty tale of numbers in this crazy mixed-up world. Drawing upon his encounters with Jester McClanahan, Professor Steinke takes us on a breathtaking tour of his persona. He can turn a normal everyday conversation about whole grain oats into an adventure across the Sahara Desert. He is truly a genius of his own era."
1,The selling of this product is a fraud.,"The presentation of this product before their purchase refers only to the technical properties of the machine but when you try to connect it at your home it forces you to buy a TiVo subscription that will cost you more than the product, even if you are not interested in it. The TiVo subscription program is not explained before selling you the machine.I had to return the unit paying international shipment costs. This is why I call the selling a fraud."
3,"Worked great for a year, Tivo stilll works, but DVD burner dead","I really enjoyed having the DVD burner. I burned all my favorite movies from TV to DVD. The Tivo part of the machine I can't live without. Unfortunately, after about a year the machine would crash every time I tried to burn a DVD. The only way I could fix it was to manually remove the DVD that was inserted in the burner and then unplug the machine and plug it back in. At first it would only crash occasionally, but eventually I risked the whole machine failing each time I tried to burn a DVD. I having nothing bad to say about Tivo, that works great and I can still watch DVDs. It is really the burner that makes this machine a flop. Personally, I would recommend getting your Tivo straight from Tivo. I've had my Tivo brand Tivo for three years now and never had a problem."
1,"uuggghhhh,... this was terrible!!","this was frustrating, confusing, and it didnt work!! my dad had to call the company and order a new one , and all this stuff!! it was terrible, and worst of all, i never got to record my favorite TV show's new episode... :( I really couldnt even give this DVR with TiVo ONE star, it derserves ZERO!!"
4,Dispite a few glitches Tivo is worth getting.,"Box works great. Recorder works great. Memory only holds 80 hours if it records on the lowest quality. At highest quality it only holds 25 hours or so, then it erases things form the memory.Also you can't watch live TV when it is recording unless you watch what it is recording. This can be a pain. Other than these things it is great. I definitely recommend it."
2,Totally disappointed,I bought the refurbished thinking it'd be just as good but wasn't. So much more difficult to use than I thought. Now I have my local cable provider's unit and it's a breeze!
5,Another Hendrix Prize,"A little modern witchcraft gone awry on one side, a lot of stubborn determination on the other, and a man caught between the two, Mason Alexander finds himself in a situation that yields a different ending than what he had in mind. He hires the pretty gardener for two weeks to pretend she is under the spell of a love potion and in love with him to teach his mother and sister, the resident witches, a lesson meant to keep them out of his personal life. The pretty young gardener opens his eyes to the world around him and he falls in love with her, as she does with him. But their agreement for a two-week appearances-only affair turns into a real test of the power of love.Do NOT miss this one. This charming story, told by a very talented story teller, will keep you awake nights. It is fresh, funny and enchanting. And don't miss Lisa Hendrix other prize, ""To Marry an Irish Rogue"". Just as fresh, funny and enchanting.One to enjoy!"
3,a direct quote...,"""Without waiting for a response from Miranda, she crossed to the corner where an electric teakettle steamed quietly on a cart. She selected a small, silver container from among the half dozen on the tray, measured out a generous portion of Keemun tea into her favorite Spode teapot, and poured the hot water over the leaves."" p 72.To 'stuff' the scene; see above. To set the scene, ""She crossed to the corner and poured herself a cup of tea from her antique set."" To advance the story, ""She poured herself a cup of tea."" I guess one's opinion of the book depends on if you're reading for the story or the words. I know enough words - tell me a story I haven't heard before. Capture me and draw me in, don't show me how well you write. Had she been drinking Darjeeling I don't think anyone would care, if she was polite enough to wait for a response, that says something about the character."
1,Not at all like the picture,"I am not happy with this item or the seller. I ordered this several days ago and never got a comfirmation e-mail from the seller, as I normally do when purchasing from a 3rd party on Amazon. I was really wanting a case for my new iPod before it got scratched (and of course because they took so long with my order, it did get scratched), so I paid for the $9+ expedited shipping. They shipped it First Class (which means normal), and the stamp on it is only for $1.25. Why did they charge me so much when the shipping was that little and the handling was not at all expedited?I was ready to forgive them for taking so long with it until I actually saw the product. It is not at all the bright yellow like the picture shows. It is more of a nasty mustard-green.I will most definitely be sending it back, and I am going to require they refund the postage as well because I did not pay nearly ten dollars for them to take their time with my order."
4,Good compliment to other Cinema Sound speakers,"For watching DVDs, this is a must-have for the CS speakers. It delivers the right amount of bass to compliment the speakers. For music, it is pretty good, but the volume has to be adjusted up on the subwoofer for sufficient bass. The design is attractive and fairly small. My biggest complaint is that the power switch, volume control, and power/standby light are all on the back, which is very inconvenient."
5,solid sub,"I bought this to compliment 2 floor standing JBL's. It has added that extra thump i was looking for in movies and music, solid purchase at a good price."
4,It's not for everyone but I liked it,"It's 3:30 in the morning and there's a movie on about an insomniac. As an insomniac, how could I possibly pass on watching this movie? I thought it was a great movie. It's a movie that appeals to the mind. What is real? Is the whole thing just one long hallucination by this guy who can't sleep? I mean with character names like Belladonna (last name of the police detective) and Uno Magic, how can you be sure anything this guy sees and hears isn't just a delusion? If you like weird movies, then this might really appeal to you. If you don't like unusual movies then watch something else. Oh, by the way, don't listen to the reviewer that said this movie was predictable. I can guess most movies within 5 minutes. But I didn't guess this one and the reason is that this movie is so weird/unusual that I just sat back and let it take me where it wanted. Rent it, buy it or catch it on cable but don't watch it the first time until it's 3:30 in the morning."
3,This is good ...,"This is really good but, then again, I like the macabre so many of you readers might not like this."
2,NOT REALLY A GOOD MOVIE; 2.5 STARS,"A MARKETING EXECUTIVE [STEPHEN BALDWIN] IS AN INSOMNIAC WHO WALKS ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT. ONE NIGHT, HE WITNESSES A MURDER AND WHEN HE TELLS THE COPS, HE BECOMES THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT. WELL-PLOTTED AND DECENTLY ACTED, BUT THE MOVIE JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S MISSING SOMETHING MOST OF THE TIME. HOWEVER, I WILL COMPLIMENT STEPHEN BALDWIN FOR ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO DO A GOOD ACTING JOB IN THIS MOVIE. UNLESS YOU LIKE MYSTERIES, DON'T BUY THIS ONE. JUST RENT IT. ONE QUESTION; WHO PUT THAT ANNOYING MUSIC IN THIS MOVIE?!!!!"
2,Not worth it.,"I thought this movie was very poor overall. Very predictable. I thought it looked intriguing, but I was sorely disapointed. There is actually a short independent film by the same name (I found it when googling ""Dead Awake"" when I was trying to find info about this movie) that is frankly much more impressive. Check it out - and then realize how sad it is that a short independent film is much more entertaining than this multi-million dollar wannabe thriller."
4,jackie baby is the best,"i have had this for years and finally thought enough to write a review...very raw and very lively,i am mostly a fan of Johnnette Napolitano and she sounds as good as ever here...always gets me tapping my foot...anyways,you can pick it up really cheap here...i bet you'll love it"
2,Vowels are not alphabetized,"Valiant and mixed effort by Johnette Napolitano and Holly Beth Vincent. The purported free style creation is intense and interesting, but overall just meanders in no particular direction. Although it definitely sounds like the ladies had a good time making the album, for us it kills time time 'til their own solo efforts come out."
