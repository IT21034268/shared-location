4,When they say XXL - they mean it,"This is well constructed and large. Much bigger than I expected. I don't recall seeing dimensions listed when I bought it. It makes a great place to keep my current scrapbook project pieces together and safe. I find the compartments on the sides to be too small to put much in and not the easiest to get things back out of - not terrible but not perfect. I'm not sure it would hold up if it's loaded down and take in and out of the car trunk a lot. Still new, so time will tell. Considering the price I am happy with it."
5,Makeup Train Case,"I'm a professional makeup artist and I was looking for an affordable alternative to the Zuca Pro cases. I have scoliosis so a wheeled option was what I was looking for. This case has so much space. The clear pockets are perfect for my lash glue, hand sanitizers, face wipes, etc. I use the top insert for my eye and lip pencils. I'm able to neatly store my eyeshadow, lip and foundation palettes in the inside dividers. Everything is easy to see and it makes organizing and packing a cinch. Its perfect for my needs!"
4,recommended by my Naturopathic Doctor,"My Doctor recommended this product to me for breast cysts. I have suffered with them for over 20 years. They were painful and getting larger. Since starting this product three months ago, the pain has gone away and the cysts feel smaller."
5,Excellent!,"This book is an excellent source of beautiful knitting patterns, including lace, cable and patterns. The black and white photo's of the stitches are so sharp and detailed, the designs pop off the page. The best part, for me, the charts are very large and so easy to see (without my glasses on!)and very easy to understand what she is telling you to do. She also gives some instructional information as well that is very good. If you buy only one knitting stitch book, this is the one to get!"
3,Only For Those Who Like Charts,"Because if you don't, you'll be miserable. This is not a book for beginners. I just don't like the ""you'll learn charts or else"" mentality here that is creeping into other knitting publications, and I am not alone in this. The patterns are great. Check it out of the library before spending your money on it. This is definitely a ""buy later"" book.Also, be warned, this book is overpriced, as are the others she's written. It is too bad a publisher like Dover didn't get hold of them--the price would be within reach of more people, and more books would be sold."
1,direction lever,The lever that chooses counter clockwise or clockwise failed almost immediately. So for it to work I have to use my thumb or other hand to hold the lever all the way to one side or the other.
5,Wow!,One of the best books I've read on church & volunteer leadership . . . Definitely in my top 5 list!!!!!
1,Only provies general info regarding menopause!,"I found the video to be a disappointment. Especially after reading the wonderful reviews it received. If your doctor has already explained the basics of menopause, this is not the video for you. The video does not provide any techniques or suggestions in dealing with menopause, how menopause might prpgresess etc. I was hoping for more in depth information and what I got was a refresher on what I already knew."
5,"Excellent information, discussion and support for women","I am a Registered Dietitian with many clients concerned about menopausal symptoms. This video addresses their concerns beautifully, and provides clear information and support. Here are examples of viewer comments: ""Something as simple as this can be life changing, and this [video] is life changing."" ""This video is awesome. It made me feel normal."" ""Some of my symptoms had made me afraid I had Alzheimers. Now I know these can be a normal part of menopause."" ""I've read some of this, but actually seeing the women helped. It was nice to see real people, and the truth about menopause, nice to know you're not the only one. This video was exactly what I needed. I felt I was right in there with them."" This video is useful for individuals and is excellent for groups as a stimulus for discussion.Vesanto Melina, MS, RD"
3,"Good, but definitely could have been better......","I want to start off by saying that I certainly enjoyed this book, but it could have been better. I'll start off with the positive first.As in all of his book, McDonough writes very well in this book. I found myself gliding through the pages. But now for the bad.I consider good maps almost essential to a great military history; I will not consider a book worth five starts if maps are nonexistant or are not good. The maps in this book are few, and, well, bad. The few provided are small and hard to read.I also found myself wanting to learn more of the details. As are McDonough's other books, this one is not very detailed.These reservations put aside, I would recommend this book to any Civil War or military history buff. But, if these problems bother you too much, I would recommend this book for only ""hardcore"" Civil War buffs, or those specifically interested in the Murfreesboro (or Stones River) Campaign."
4,Bar Room Brawl!,"This bloody Murfreesboro, Tennessee battle became a turning point in the central theater of the Civil War. Starting with a Confederate surprise attack, 24,000 casualties would be inflicted on both sides before the Union army would awake to find the Confederate army having deserted the field three days later. Fought by two mediocre generals, Braxton Bragg and William S. Rosecrans, this engagement was intense and ugly. Once begun, there was little strategy involved. The opposing armies simply mauled each other.Stones River was the first major battle in the Union's plan to seize the Nashville-Chattanooga-Atlanta corridor. Claimed by many to be a tactical draw, it was a Southern defeat of the worst sort. The South lost control of an invaluable asset, middle Tennessee's railroads. It is from this spring board that Union armies once again sliced the Confederacy in two."
2,You cannot set the clock!!!,"This phone is cheap....the sound quality matches (which I can live with). What I couldn't deal with was that they include a clock that the user CAN NOT SET. Nowhere in the manual does it give instructions for setting the clock (although you can set the language, area code, ringer, and blinky lights). Turns out...the undocumented ""feature"" is that you have to wait for a callerID call to come in...and then the clock is supposed to set. Guess what....doesn't work. So..it's a cheap phone with cool blinky lights that never has the right time set."
2,THIS WAS KINDA UNCALLED FOR,"A GROUP OF Y0UNG BOYS FROM WEST OAKLAND FEUD WITH A TEENAGE DRUG DEALER. NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, BUT AT LEAST IT IS WELL INTENDED. BUT, THE FILMAKERS MUST NOT TAKE THIS MOVIE THAT SERIOUSLY, BEING THAT THE CAST ISN'T EVEN LISTED ON THE COVER! I GUESS IT SHOULD APPEAL TO MOST FANS OF GANGSTA MOVIES."
4,Tree Tree Oil Foot Repair Balm,The product--which really is soothing and healing--is now in a much smaller tube than it used to be packaged in and the shipping price was extremely high. I have used this product for over 5 years but will have to look for a less expensive replacement. Sorry.
1,Not a good product,"Did not deliver as described. Take a pass on this product and the Tea Tree foot wash, also. They do not improve the condition of the skin whatsoever."
5,Tea Tree Oil Foot Repair Balm,Best stuff I have found for peeling skin. My wife uses it on her elbows and arms!
3,Its just okay,"When my favorite foot cream (got2b soothing soles) was nowhere to be found, I searched for a replacement. I saw this at amazon with really great reviews and I generally tend to like Tea Tree ingredient in products so I ordered this one. Now, my feet are in pretty decent shape to begin with. I don't have any calluses or cracked heels etc. Maybe just a little dry skin and and tired feet at the end of the day. So, before sleeping, I always wash my feet and apply a good foot creme, this has been a part of my nightly routine for years. When I used this foot balm, I didn't feel any relaxing or soothing sensation. It absorbed well but it was just like any other cream. I didn't find it anything special. My bath and body works lotion worked better on my feet for moisturizing purpose. I wont order this again and will keep looking for my favorite one that used to make my tired feet sigh with cooling relief."
1,Doesn't work,"What else can I say, it does not work. A moisturizer from walmart works better. I was excited to get this, but was extremely disappointed."
3,ITS OKAY...NOT THE BEST FOR DRY FEET,I just moved to arizona from utah and my feet super dried out... i used to have perfect feet when i was using hempz original lotion.. then i moved and couldnt find my lotion so i looked here online and saw this and thought it was over priced.. so i went to ross and found it for 4.99 and bought it there and ive been using it for over a month now and my feet are still scratchy... i put it on at night and wear fuzzy socks over my feet when i sleep cause it seems to work with this stuff a little better.. but barely a difference.. some healing is going on but not smooth like they used to be... so i will not be buying this stuff again... (doesn't smell good either)i am going to give O'Keeffe's Healthy Feet Creme a try and see how that goes i will ordering that sometime in the next 24 hours and will be reviewing that aswell..
5,"Great product, half the price at BBB!!!","I wanted to see if I could get this product on Amazon, and you can, at twice the price!!! Its the best foot cream on the market, a little but goes a long way and the scent it amazing. I just wish it was more reasonable on here. Shame."
2,A bit disappointing,"This shoe gives a fit that is a bit too wide and even though i ordered my size it didnt fit quite right, also it pinches at the toes."
4,quick study guide,"AutoCAD in its 2006 version is quite formidable. Centuries of programmer time have been spent to refine this product. Thus a comprehensive description of what you can do with it would be a huge and perhaps offputting book. Omura provides an easy alternative.He teaches the basic operations that you are likely to need. Enough to get you productively making simple three dimensional objects and manipulating their properties.But, if you are migrating to AutoCAD 2006 because you need a new feature within it, you should probably consult a more thorough text. Chances are that the latest features are refinements that most new users would not be dealing with, and thus not covered by Omura."
3,Great Styling - Works need Improvement,I've had this watch for several years and enjoy the styling and sturdiness (no scratches to date). The watch does burn through batteries annually and has needed the control buttons fixed twice resulting in my 3 star rating.
4,"Dodge Ram, Magnaflow exhaust 5""","Exhaust kit showed up in a very timely manor, One Day Early. Price was cheaper than going to a local store. However, installation was a pain in the butt. Turbo down exhaust pipe, didnt want to mount in the Dodges existing exhaust bracket. Had to do a little modifying to the hanger. But other than that very simple installation. Sounds like a little sports car but deeper toned!"
1,wrong dvd,I ordered a dvd that I was wanting but instead they sent one that I had no interest in. I wish that I had the one that I had originally ordered!!!!!!!!!!
5,Viva samba,I get this as a gift from somebody a nod I thought that its a cheep perfume but its turns to be one of my favorite
3,It is o.k.,"Bought this stand and thought this would be the perfect solution. Every year, my husband grumbles through his task of putting up the tree. It is always a problem getting the tree straight. The problem with this stand is that it is not very sturdy. It is a wonderful idea it just needs to be made out of something stronger than plastic. Our tree is currently in this stand and it has not fallen over yet but I don't think I'll use it again next year."
4,A Holiday Lifesaver!,"I purchased this swivel stand primarily as a means to quell the annual holiday argument that my wife and I have over straightening our Christmas tree. The stand works and locks very easily. The only issue I have is that it is a little bulky (understandably, though), and if you have a tree that's very top heavy, it won't lock as precisely (through trial and error, though, it's easy to compensate). Overall I would highly recommend this product. It truly does simplify the tree straightening process."
1,Three have broken on me,I love the theory behind this stand. In practice it does not work well. I have tried three of them by two different makers over a 15 year period. Each time the plastic breaks and tragedy either occurs or is narrowly averted. (Experience in wiring the top) I guess to make it with the materials that would allow the concept to work requires parts that would put the price point way out of the market.
2,Swivel straight tree stand,This product does not work as well as the larger model. It's worth the extra bucks to get the 12' model. The tree wobbles at the point where the clamps are supposed to hold it. The 12' model has large fingers that reach up into the tree stump and hold it securely.
4,cat proof,"This stand was definitely worth the money. After getting our new cat, found out that he likes to climb the tree. The thing barely moves and has not come close to tipping over with him in the tree. Hold's a good amount of water too, even when tilted at an angle. I'd definitely recommend this, it works and the price(although it was a little hard to justify the price at first) seems right."
5,Crowfoot,"you don't use a crowfoot often, but when you need it you need it! This tool did exactly what we needed on our 1952 tractor and made life much better! dj"
4,Great Light,"This thing is exactly what I wanted: super bright, very compact, long lasting rechargeable battery.It would get 5 stars except the on/off mechanism has been kind of an annoyance. You twist to lock it on, and press and hold the button to temporarily turn it on. I understand that perhaps a more 'hardcore' user like a fireman or police officer might want an on/off mechanism they don't need to worry about shutting off accidentally. However, for me, this is a bit much. It's difficult to turn and other people can never figure it out without being instructed. I wish it just had a standard push button to lock it on."
4,Recharge is so nice.,The light isn't as comfortable as a Surefire light but the recharge saves me a lot of money. Its very bright for its size and easy to carry. I've had several good comments from co-workers and bystanders on this little light.
5,Good Old Television,It is nice to see good old television again instead of all the profanity and garbage on TV today.
1,What arrogance by CBS/Paramount!!!,"This is just plain arrogance by CBS/Paramount. They take a show that was only moderately popular in the late 80s and almost obscure right now and try to rip off the few loyal fans of the show by splitting up the seasons while charging almost full price. Why in the world they split up the first season when it only aired 22 episodes!!! This is absurd. It is nothing but greed by CBS/Paramount. They realize that this the only chance for fans of the show to see it again and really want to make them pay for it. I mean, if the consumer bought both volumes, it amounts to over $70 for 22 episodes of a mediocre-at-best show. I'm also guessing that music has been altered and there are no special features. This is just another pathetic attempt by CBS/Paramount to squeeze every last penny out of the consumer in a brutal economy. Shame on you, CBS/Paramount! I will be skipping this release!Grade of the Show: 3 stars. Grade of CBS/Paramount's release strategy: 1 star."
3,Jake and the Fatman??????,"Many questions about this show because I wasn't a big fans of it. I thought it was basically a show for females. Good looking Joe Penny and always serious in a funny sort of a way William Conrad carried a very ""vanilla"" show. The show went for five years so I guess that might explain the dvd release, but why in volumes not seasons? One favorite episode off this volume, but can think of a few other shows that rank dvd release dates more! With that said, I hope shows get released in seasons oppose to season volumes!!!"
5,feed back,"I like Amazon it is really fast on the product I had bought. I ordered a dvd on July 8th, it was shipped on July10th and I recieved it on July12th. That was fast and I will do business with them again.And everything came ok, nothing was damage. Also the DVD's were all good and nothing wrong with them. Wanda"
4,Great Book it really is,I got another version of this book. The cover is actually a photo of a purple velvet table strewn over with fortune-telling stuff and the twins' pictures on the top corner. Anyway the story was very interesting and was one of the best Sweet Valley books I've evr read! You should get it too
4,"Mournful, yet compelling","Crybaby is actually Danny Coughlan a Bristol based singer songwriter who's debut album might just get you yearning for a different era. With a sound that is reminiscent of Roy Orbison and has a sixties feel. Layered vocals, guitars and other instruments work to produce an oddly beguiling sound that whilst is undoubtedly sad in its lyrical content. However, such tracks as We're Supposed To Be In Love, Twist of The Knife and When The Lights Go Out keep coming back at you. Indeed Veils, with its gulf war content, really is haunting and moving. Yet its darkness is indeed a strength. Its not a black as some music around.This is a good début that will slowly creep into your consciousness. It has a draw and a sound that reminds you of a lot of other things and yet is perfectly placed in the current era."
2,Wake Me When The Story Starts,"The book was slow and ponderous. I was intrigued by the plot, because really, I don't think I've read a romance where the hero shoots the heroine. I wanted to see how Blake intended to write herself out of that corner.Slowly. Very Slowly.I tried to see the sparkage between Roan and Donna/Tory, but it didn't work for me. There was so little danger after the opening gambit, and Donna/Tory spent so much of the story bored out of her skull, that I was bored as a result. There was also the implausibility that a woman of logic and above average intelligence didn't know how to hire her own attorney and establish herself as both mentally competent and in charge of her personal affairs.Alas, I couldn't get past such obvious things, and with Blake creating a story that's slow, languorous and syrupy, I kept reaching for the cattle prod--just to move things along."
4,wheres the zippers?,"excellent light jacket/ vest. new models have hidden zippers with tiny grippers, not good with gloves. otherwise very nice product with lifetime warranty"
4,the Church as the Body of Christ,"This was not an easy book for me to read. However, it discusses the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist and compares it with other forms of his presence. If you read the Bible carefully, you cannot miss the parts where Jesus is present in your neighbor in need and that the community of christian people (Church) is the body of Christ."
5,Love the backyardigans,If you have a little one that loves the backyardigans as much as mine does you may want to know which episodes are on this disc.-Match On Mt. Olympus-The Great Dolphin Race-Ranch Hands From Outer Space-Caveman's Best FriendWe will watch this over and over just like the other Backyardigan DVD's
5,Book of Abrahan,"This book is not an easy read. You have to put it down and think about it. This is a story of a Jewish family down through the ages. Hundreds of years. They suffered terribly in the name of religion. It goes rigtup through World War 2. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes to read and take their time. Normally I can finish a book in a few days, but this one I wanted to absorb so I took 2 weeks. Excellent writing."
3,Bad design,"I like how it keeps my coffee piping hot, but it drips down the spout every time I pour a cup. Fast or slow pour, it drips. Now that I know that, I just make sure to wipe it down with a paper towel after every fill up and then set it on a napkin so I don't get a black coffee ring stain on my kitchen counter. If returning items on Amazon were easier, I'd send it back and try different one."
5,Avodah Worship Magazine,"With his debut album Driftwood, Mike Swann has created a worship album to get excited about. From the driving ""Higher Than I"" to the pensive, soulful ""Driftwood"" and ""Everything I Need,"" this record never skips a beat. Each song is artfully crafted and a solid reminder that God is in control and worthy of unending praise and adoration.Mike's acoustic-guitar-driven, roots-rock style of worship music is sweetened by a subtle yet soul-lifting Hammond organ. Jim DeMain, who works with the Gospel/Jam-band, Waterdeep from Kansas City, did a first-rate job of mastering Driftwood. The overall sound is somewhat reminiscent of the records of Bebo Norman and Mitch McVicker.This record passes one of my personal top criteria for a great album: When the last track ends, I have to reach down and start the record all over. There are very few albums that pass this test, but Driftwood is now on that list."
5,Mixing bowls with lids,The lids fit tightly (sometimes difficult to seal) and the bowls are of great quality. Nice variety of sizes.
1,Cuisinart mixing bowls,"As of today, 3/24 I have not received this product. Very disappointed with delivery."
5,Excellente!,"This 19-track collection of Latin hits is absolutamente fantastico (really great!) Some of the well-known bilingual artists include Son by 4, Shakira, and Ricky Martin. These songs are the No. 1 Latino hits of 2000. My most favorite song was ""La Bomba.""I recommend it (Lo recomiendo)."
1,Bulging eyes,"The Sleeper in the Sands is a totally overrated book. When you're on page 189, you've gone through about the same amount of people with 'eyes popping out of their skulls of fear' or suffering from 'a chill running down their spine they never felt before'. But you still have no clue why they're all so terrified, so you kinda lose interest. C'mon Tom, you know better than giving your audience just a shivering bunch of people and no clue to entertain us."
2,The ancient Egypt,"If this story is truth I have my questions, but even if is true, the book doesn't invite you to keep reading and the less you read is about Tutankhamen.In the other hand you will learn some things about the ancient Egypt, but read it with a lot of patience."
3,Too much focus on bible references,"I have to agree with the reviewer that said it was simplistic and doesn't deal with the rich symbolism of C.S. Lewis' works. I bought this book based on the reviews and I homeschool so I thought it would be perfect for our religion class. But it was so wrapped up in the author's interpretation of the biblical references we find ourselves just taking apart Lewis's symbolism with no help from this book.I enjoyed the book, but it really is more simplistic than I expected."
1,Simplistic and very disappointing,"This guide does NOT deal with the rich symbolism and imagery of CS Lewis's wonderful (and wonder filled) stories. Instead, the author merely cites biblical quotes that he feels are appropriate. This guide is much more about scripture than ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". CS Lewis probably rolled over in his grave when this so called ""guide"" was written."
5,A wonderful guide for adults and children,"As a repeated reader of The Chronicles of Narnia, and one who took a class on the series, I was delighted with this work. It succinctly breaks down each chapter into biblical parallels and insights that are subtly woven into Lewis's stories. I gained such insight and found so many new things in each of the books. This is a great guide for teachers or parents reading the series to children."
5,Allows you to view Narnia in a whole new light.,This book opened a new depth to the Chronicles.It expounds on lessons that could be easily overlooked or unnoticed.It draws parallels to biblical stories and values in a very simple and easy to follow way.This book enhanced my Narnia experience.
2,quick read but gets annoying just as fast!,"I am not an 'older mommie' but do have a preemie and she was one of two. There are some really fun moments in this book. However the people in it are are pretty self centered. I enjoyed the parts about henry and gus. The nanny has got to got though. She acts as if she is paying the mother. The father of these children is an old crab. Ms newman is pretty much a single mother. There is one statement in these book that was stupid. She states that a woman who could get rid of her dog, can just as easily get rid of her child. What the heck? Yet, as another poster stated she at one point wishes her children dead. This is a woman who starts off with around the clock help from a nanny!!"
2,"I wanted to like this book, I truly wanted to like this book","but I was very disappointed with it. As I was reading it, I kept closing it and looking at the spine label to see if it was really non fiction because I couldn't believe the nasty things Judith Newman said about the people in her life. Aspiring to be an over-40 mom myself, I saw how little Newman's life related to my own experiences. More than that though, the tone of the book left me cold. I guess if you are a well-to-do Manhattanite in an unconventional marriage who believes acerbity is charming, this is a book you would like. I wonder what Gus & Henry will think when they are old enough to read the book?"
3,A Sad Story,"I was expecting to laugh--I'm an over-forty mother, too, and I look for books on the topic of older mothers. This one is about a woman who went through the trauma of hormonal treatments, failed in-vitros and one that finally worked. Then the babies were born prematurely, and as her story shows, have many developmental delays. Her mixed feelings about her children and her unhappy relationship with her husband--she thinks of dating other men after forcing this sixty-six year old man to father the children she desperately wants, when he's made it clear he thinks he's too old, and that's not surprising--are the real story. She writes very well, but this is funny only for women who have had similar bad experiences with fertility treatments, who have given up on them and want to convince themselves that motherhood is not so wonderful a thing after all, or who are unsatisfied with their children and partners for other reasons."
2,I wanted to love it,"I had my twins at 35 after fertility treatments and still had a difficult time relating to the woman in this book. Not because I like things sugar-coated or pretend that motherhood is always a bed of roses. But for a far better written realistic account of how tough new babies can be on your psyche,read Anne Lamott's Operating Insructions.Judith Newman had a charmed life, with the full time nanny and never bothering to breastfeed even one week,even though the babies were preemies and one had very serious weight gain issues for months.There are some funny lines, but mostly I just found myself disgusted with her and being happy i checked it out from the library instead of buying it."
2,"Self-indulgent, harmful","Newman goes for the big laugh and that's fine (I laughed, too, sometimes). But her page-long rant about adoption was disgusting and truly harmful. Perpetuating negative stereotypes about adopted children (""horribly damaged"") is unconscionable. After all the chemicals and hormones and medical intervention it takes to create her babies, she's worried about the unknown gene pool of an adopted child?!"
5,Love this tea,"Although decaffeinated, this tea is a lovely afternoon treat that can be drunk without fear of sleep disruption later in the night. The convenience of ordering in bulk and with delivery to our door makes us continue to reorder from Amazon time and again."
4,"Not the same as the non decaf, but good nonetheless.","I have finally tried the decaf Twinings version of the delicious English Breakfast. I wouldn't call it English Breakfast since it doesn't taste like it, but it does taste nice. If you think of it as a new tea and not as the decaf version of another flavour, you will enjoy it.For those who drink a lot of tea, this is the solution.I love TWININGS!!!!"
2,Decaf breakfast,"I typically love breakfast tea, caf and decaf but, this tea doesn't taste so hot. No one in my house likes it. With that said, I love the regular Twinings Breakfast tea."
2,If you like weak tea ...,"What was once a great tea has fallen prey to a worldwide packaged food malady: smaller portions, weaker portions, or artificial ingredient substitutes -- all in the name of cutting costs. In the case of Twining's decaf English Breakfst tea, the amount of tea per bag seems to be shrinking at at alarming rate each year. My latest purchase has turned out to be the weakest tea I've ever had.It's back to loose tea filling a tea`caddy and, hopefully, more flavor."
4,Not just a great actress but a great singer!,"Only a few words will descibe the feeling recieved ...I loved it. Not only good spirited but good looks also. Her sensuality as latin american, gives that extra touch to her music! The titled song ""las juanas"" have opened up new grounds for Carolina Sabino. great work...! Will Grande"
2,Pure music history,"This CD is a wormhole back in time to a much simpler era. Sal's vocals are clear and folksey. John was always my favorite drummer and he could drive a song with his beat alone. Add the other members and you have a group that answered the British invasion with American mop-tops that had a first rate sound. I still think ""Laugh, Laugh"", ""Still In Love With You Baby"" and ""Don't Talk To Strangers"" are some of the best songs to come out of the sixties. Put on your bell bottoms,Beatle boots, and Neru jackets then goove with the Beau Brummels."
3,"THEY WERE HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW.....","This group made a splash when few American groups were being heard from during the ""British invasion"". Their sound was a bit unique and was responsible for their two big hits, ""Laugh Laugh"" and ""Just A Little"". There are three or four other good songs on this album with the rest mediocre at best. Perhaps they would have fared better if they were not competing against a huge group of very talented British groups during the golden decade of rock and roll."
2,"""Beau"" follows ""Beat""","The Best of the Beau Brummels is a fairly interesting period piece. I never heard the group perform live but enjoyed some of their hits in the sixties. The songs don't sound all that good today, but they're okay. Perhaps the liner notes turned me off. The liner notes state that the group took its name because ""Beau"" follows ""Beat"" (as in Beatles), alphabetically speaking. People browsing the Beatles' bin would stumble onto the Beau Brummels records. That's not too kool, and it seems the group lacked the musical originality that made other groups lasting icons. This is not a terrible CD. It's okay. But why any group would tamper with Bob Dylan's words, as the Beau Brummels do in ""One Too Many Mornings,"" is beyond my wildest imagination. If you love sixties music, this is a good addition to your collection, but it won't be on the top of your stack."
4,A Grounded Review,"Being in my mid 40's I was just a tad too young to remember these guys from when they were making this music. I admit that I bought the CD based on some of the hype that I read while surfing for a couple of CDs.As far as the music goes, I think it is pretty good stuff. I recognized the two hits ""Laugh, Laugh"" and ""Just a Little"" as soon as they played, and there are a few others that I really like. As someone who likes Gary Puckett, Grass Roots, Buckinghams, Hollies, and similar bands I found these guys very listenable. Maybe not quite as spectacular as I read, but over all, not a wasted purchase. The CD comes with a very nice insert that explains some of the history of the band. I really enjoyed reading through it and I think you might also."
4,touch the stars as in a dream.......,"Like the Searchers? the 1st nuggets box? the 1st 2 byrds albums?I do. and i love this too! From moptop pop to the beginnings of psychedelia and folk rock,this is a fine varied and classy collection with a good half dozen absolute stormers. Very listenable album, unlike a lot of single band albums from the era. For the price, it's a steal"
4,BEAU BRUMMELS:....JUST DANDY!!,"You can imagine the beau's record company/manager saying something like ''look fella's you gotta pick up on this mersey sound thing its a happening scene... and it sells!!''well in essence the earlier tracks on this splendid overview are indeed tinged with that liverpool flavour with a sprinkling of byrd's thrown in, but it did not detract from the fact that the BEAU BRUMMELS wrote and performed some truly dazzling material that deserves to be remembered and enjoyed.Included here is their smash single LAUGH LAUGH,with its glorious MAMA'S and PAPA'S style chorus and a real gem in the baroque/psychadelicand slightly spooky MAGIC HOLLOW a track thats up there withTHE MONKEES 'PORPOISE SONG' and BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD'S 'IN THE HOUR OF NOT QUITE RAIN' in the flower power wierdness stakes.Listen with affection."
4,The Last Free Chief of the Modoc Nation,"As someone who lives very close to the spot where all of this brutality and inhumanity took place I found the ""story telling"" nature of the writing style very enjoyable.Not preachy or overly judgemental but a story that is informative, and enlightening as well as being just a darn good read."
5,A Plea for Justice,"This allegory mirrors the injustice perpetrated by man upon man from the beginning, and enters a plea for justice for all the downtrodden of this day and age as well as all those gone before."
2,"Entertaining, but not informative","The book is easy to read, however, it is very repetitive. Nothing but horror stories, which quite honestly do not seem real. The few good advice given does not go any detail, just a tragic story. The book is VERY unorganized, it sends you all over the place with no particular direction. The author seems to have quite an ego, all through out the book he mentions being right. It is entertaining book, but it should not be taken seriously."
3,Simple.,"In one word, Simple. A simple book doesn't deserve a complex book review. Simple is simple, and the book is as simple as this review.Bye."
4,Godd Starter book,Gives you the basics that build the blocks for a solid foundation on the stock market.
2,Not too hot,"Easy read and good flow, but this book spends a lot of pages stating the obvious (even obvious or me, and I'm a novice to investing). Some of the early chapters discuss whether or not you're really ready to invest... well, duh! I would not have gotten this book if I was not ready to invest! Anyway, too many pages wasted on that. The real sin with this book is that the author dodges one of the most important things that needs to be talked about with stock investing-- rating the various broker firms. Ok author, I know you can't endorse one over the other directly, but how about helping your readers to find out how they can find out for themselves instead of leaving them stranded. If you're like me and you already know what companies you want to invest in, then one of the main things you need to find out about is which brokers would be the best for you and your needs, and this book never gave any hints."
3,Fairly informative book - bad Kindle adaption,"I bought this book in order to get a fairly basic intro to stock investing and an overview of basic terms that you hear about all the time. It served that purpose fairly efficiently like all books in the ""Dummy"" series usually do. Unfortunately, the Kindle version is fairly crappy. No ability to jump back and forth through chapters (which you will find yourself wanting to do a lot with this book) and many of the graphs and charts end up mangled on the kindle.The author also indulges in a little right wing preaching now and then. Not too annoying - but in 2011, his blanket preaching against all tax increases seems a little... well... tea party dumb."
4,A good start,"Like all the ""Dummies"" this is great groundwork. If you can not get through this book you should not be investing."
4,Good book.,"Good product for those who just started investing and wants to get their feet wet. This is real investing, not trading."
4,Light weight introduction to stock investing.,I learned quite a bit from this. It's a very good starting place for the Newbie investor.
2,A little disappointing,"I believe the several hundred pages of this book, could have been condensed in to less than 100 pages. Just too much repeitive information. Too much fluff. In my opinion, not the best book to read, if you're trying to learn about stock investing. I believe this book was either written or eddited by a Dummy."
2,make your own,shoemakers use 50% isopropyl alcohol/water mix to soften leather for stretching- you can do the math on what that costs
1,Too expensive,"Seriously. Here is a much better solution. Just use what people in the shoe repair biz have always used...regular, cheap, alcohol!For very stiff leather shoes and even sneakers...try a 50/50 mixture of good old tap water or distilled water(if your tap water is too hard or discolored, etc.) and alcohol.Seriously! It works well. Just use your imagination. You can pour it into the shoe, put on a sock and wear until dry then rinse and repeat until you get the results you want.Some shoes might only need 1 part alcohol 3 parts water. You can pour it in, spray it on...whatever.Have a new pair of boat shoes with an abrasive heels that rub you raw?Take some alcohol/water mix(or just pure alcohol), soak a cotton ball with it, then rub the heel inside area. Rinse and repeat as needed until it stretches or softens to your liking."
2,shoe stretch solution,"Did I really just pay around $12 for a small bottle of isopropyl alcohol? This product works somewhat, but I can't help but wonder if it works any better than water and/or alcohol. I have used a product in the past that worked amazingly well, but I can't seem to find it now. This was not it."
1,beware!,"I can't tell if this product works any better than water. The ""stretch"" seems to revert back to original shape after stretchers are removed. No instructions were included other than ""works fast as lightning""---and lightning moves at 186,000 miles per second---so what fraction of a second is required for this product to work? The company failed to respond to my request for how to use this product."
2,Not what I expected,I think it's just isopropyl alcohol ( or rubbing alcohol) which costs $1 in drug stores. The spray has the same smell. That's why you can spray and wear wet shoes immediately after spraying. There is no harm for you but at the same time there is no result. Manufacturer doesn't say a word about ingredients. Use wooden shoe stretcher to stretch your shoes.
4,Alright,"It's just achohol and water, it helped my shoes stretch a little with my shoe stretcher, so I guess I works huh."
1,a botlle with soap and water,"save your money, all this 5 stars reviews got to be either the business' owner's family or customers that got another free bottle (yeah of soap and water!!)"
5,Helped save my shoes!,"I used this along withHigh Heel Shoe Stretcher, Women'sto reshape my shoes after I had surgery. It was easy to use, did not have an unpleasant odor, and saved me a ton of money."
3,This is a great help!,I needed some help with a narrow pair of shoes. This just fit the bill!It arrived in a timely manner and the cost was fair.
5,Good Problem Solver,This is a real solution for leather items that are a bit tight fitting. I use it on gloves and shoes to increase the comfort.
5,Second Graders LOVE It!,"Even though the package states ages 9-14, this game has just enough excitement and challenge to it to keep my second gradersinterested and tolerant of the math problems.The back story is not of major interest to them, however, the music and periodic interruptions by ""mission control"" keep thepace kinetic, and the action engaging. I love the idea that the sea creatures are not harmed, but rather, the students ""shoot"" themwith ink pellets that temporarily hide and immobilize the sea creatures for a few seconds, long enough for the ""sub"" to continuesearching for and collecting the desired objects!The math problems are at a just-right challenge level for secure second grade math students, andcan be used as enrichment/reward/incentive for students who are able to work independently and/or require motivation.This game is also a fun ""inside"" consolation when outside play is not an option!For approx. $15, this is both a useful and valued math manipulative in our classroom!"
1,Bush Admin too inept to have pulled this off,"Beyond referring to the easily readable Popular Mechanics article of about two years ago, which demonstrates just how the jet fuel could have brought the towers down so quickly, etc., beyond Griffin not being a structural engineer or any other kind of engineer, beyond his relying heavily on Thierry Meyssan's thoroughly debunked ""The Big Lie,"" I can tell you the No. 1 reason not to believe the conspiracy theory that the U.S. government is in any way behind 9/11:Look at four years of the Iraq War; look at the post-Katrina response. The George W. Bush White House is too inept to have pulled this off.Unfortunately, neither empirical evidence nor logical reasoning have ever stood in the way of a good, er, bad, conspiracy theory."
1,Drivel,"If one were to look at the sources for these claims they would find that they come from the same people who claim that missles hit the WTC and pentagon. But we have all heard that claim before...whats so special about that.. No, thats not all folks.. some refute, what about eyewitness accounts of people seeing a plane hit? These sources claim that it was a advanced government technology (""holographic projection"" to be exact)that was put on the cruise missile to make it look like a AA or United flight... Bravo... Im so glad we have the watchful minds of people like that in our society...somone needs a doggie treat. Honestly .. do people have nothing better to do than come up with this cart load of dung?"
5,Leading arguments for the alternative view of 9/11,"The official conspiracy theory holds that 19 hijackers of Muslim Arab origin under direction of a former CIA operative with kidney disease from a cave in Afghanistan in a secret operation defeated the most advanced air-defense system in the world in a surprise attack. The alternative conspiracy theory holds that men in positions of power within the US political structure, military services, and intelligence agencies--who would stand to gain incredibly more power--planned, enabled, and/or controlled the attacks of 9/11. The alternative theory by necessity also holds that the perpetrators of 9/11 covered up their crime largely through the advocacy of an official conspiracy theory....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"
5,A Wake Up Call,"The most disturbing fact about Dr. Griffin's book, The New Pearl Harbor, is that it was not written by a ""wild-eyed conspiracy theorist,"" but by a brilliant Christian theologian who has the courage of a Hebrew prophet. Every American should read this book---especially, every Christian American."
5,"Well-documented, critical information","I was sceptical when I first heard about this book. I sat in the bookstore and read it for about 20 minutes and was hooked. I knew this was not just some fringe alarmist; this is important. I read the book in a matter of days, though at times I had to set it down and breathe deeply. Many of the unanswered questions are profoundly disturbing... Griffin is clear and thorough. Griffin works through eight possible levels of what the Bush administration knew about 9/11 and when. Though the work is disturbing, I felt energized rather than overwhelmed. I give it my highest recommendation."
1,"Why no ""weapons of mass destruction"" in the conspiracy?","Let's say the Bush administration, or a cabal of Neo-cons, pulled off this incredible deception. Why didn't they then plant at least the elements used for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? The former is so hard, the latter comparatively simple. Bush would be vindicated and marching through Tehran by now. And it's not like he didn't have a huge window of time to ""discover"" some fissionable material. This whole conspiracy idea makes no sense without that crucial next step."
4,The New Pearl Harbor,"I really enjoyed this book. It went into depth on most of the facts and events that occurred on September 11th, 2001. You never would have thought about some of the facts or questions and you will be amazed by some of the answers that are given in this book. If you are a person who is interested in government and politics, I highly recommend this book to you."
5,Best balanced overview of 9/11,David R Griffins books are the most balanced of the 9/11 booksand contain genuine attempts to understand the argument from both sides (though in conclusion there can be little balance as the sheer weight of evidence on US complicity is staggering).A must read for every serious student of 9/11.
5,Good Luck Sleeping,"I have been having nightmares since being loaned this book by a good friend several days ago. I, too, never questioned the official story of Sept. 11th for many years, but the gross incompetence of this administration, coupled with its outright vampiric quest for more resources and calamity in the MidEast, that becomes more and more blatant each day, have finally made me start to be a more vigilant and demanding citizen. INFORMATION IS THE OXYGEN OF A DEMOCRACY. Read this book, and then talk to your friends and loved ones about what you think. And don't forget to VOTE!!!"
3,"""There's something happenin' here...................""","This is a MUST READ book! It's clear, logical, and encourages you to draw your own conclusions about what really happened on 911 in NYC. You won't be sorry you did. Everyone should read it. Soon."
3,Review of the reviews,"This review is confined to only one question. What are the negative ""reviews"" reviewing? Notice that the negative reviews almost NEVER cite page numbers and specific parts of the book they are ""reviewing.""With good reason. These ""reviews"" are nothing more than sound bites inserted to put down good books that bring up difficult questions that any member of a DEMOCRACY must ask. Unless one is so naive as to believe that it is impossible for the USA to be taken over by an almost bloodless coup then one must be EVER VIGILENT!If a ""reviewer"" is going to review a book, have the intelligence and the honor to cite exactly what the author is so horribly ""wrong thinking"" about. If not, you, the reviewer are no better are you?Anyone can write a negative ""review"" that does nothing more than make mean faces while calling the writer bad names and telling the world how stupid he or she is. Try writing a REAL REVIEW that analyzes something. Better yet, try writing a book!"
5,Make time to read this before Nov 2!,"Compelling, convincing, and a book that everyone should read--AND DISCUSS--before Nov 2! Readers, pay special attention to Griffin's emphasis on HOW anyone who opposes oe even questions Bush is handled from a media perspective and then look at how amazon has chosen to list the 11 editorial reviews... Take a look at the very first review (a negative one) listed--the one by Reed Business. Then read the article about the ""executive schemes"" on (...)about the leaders of Reed. Know whose voice is speaking. Why is Reed's complete review listed in the most prominent place in the amazon ad and all the others (all positive) are only one-sentence commentaries? No, amazon, I'm not suggesting you are 'part of a conspiracy' but I am suggesting that your placement of reviews was not a coincidence or incompetence."
5,a must read and then demand answers!,"This is a very interesting, thought provoking book. What it did for me was to explain why the simple brush off answers people, who haven't read much concerning theses various claims and questions in depth tend to spout, don't work.You do not have to agree with every detail in this book to come to the realization that there is so much more going on.We have aright to know the truth; about 911, the PNAC/ neocons,the war, reconstructionist, our democracy and our stolen elections."
1,More Chariots of the Gods,"The writers argue that George W. Bush was actually behind the 9/11 attack and that the Pentagon was hit by a US missle, not by an airplane piloted by Islamic terrorists. Reading it reminded me of Eric von Denikan's bizarre book from the 1970's Chariots of the Gods. Denikan thought the pyramids of Giza and Machu Pichu were built by aliens who arrived in flying saucers. The senior author is a theologian, which shows that the religious left is every bit as paranoid as the religious right."
4,The place to start,"The best introduction for a closer look at the absurdities in the ""conspiracy theory"" put forth by the government and the mainstream press. The only thing I would caution against is to put the blame all on the Bush Administration. After digesting the New Pearl Harbor I recommend Webster Tarpley's ""9/11: Synthetic Terror Made in USA"" for a deeper look at how the attacks were carried out and by whom."
5,Food for the Musical Soul,"I bought this for my IPAD and have been absolutely thrilled at the quality of both the performances as well as the sound quality. Herreweghe is a master at putting together music from the 17th century, and this compilation is as good as it gets.Schutz wrote much music to the Psalms of David. Like his musical forbears from Venice, Schutz uses the antiphonal characteristics of usually two choirs and musical ensembles performing to each other, creating interesting effects and sonorities. The acoustics can also be used to dramatic effect with this type of music and this performance utilizes every weapon in Schutz's arsenal.Truly delightful music to download onto your MP3, IPAD or other tablet. I cannot recommend this album enough."
4,Huband loves it,I got this for my husband and he loves it. I'm glad you mention that it's for the 2nd generation because I have bought others that didn't say that and they didn't work and I didn't know why. After doing some research I found out that the ones we were tring to use was for the older style. But this works great for the new nano's that are out.
3,"2G = 2nd generation, not 2 GB","I unfortunately thought that this would be compatible with my 1st generation iPod Nano because I thought that 2G indicated how many GB the iPod should have. Whoops. As a result, this doesn't fit my iPod and I'm disappointed in myself for not researching the product more before buying it. So much for the young people being familiar with technological lingo!If you have a 2nd generation iPod Nano, this looks like a great little system--very lightweight and simple to charge and use."
1,It's JUST awful!,"It doesn't even fit the exact ipod it's designed for. It requires me to shove my ipod into the space provided, worry that I'm breaking it, and then discover that it won't even play music. DEFINITELY not recommended!!"
5,John Denver's best CD,"If you like John Denver, this is his best CD. It was recorded to be a CD and the concert was at the Sydney Australia Opera House- imagine the acoustics! It is too bad the other songs he sang that night were not put on a second CD."
4,Amazing!!! Just amazing!,"Recorded in 1977, ""Live at Sidney Opera House"" is an amazing John Denver's live. Denver was ""really high"": in 1977 made some changes in his music (with ""i want to live"") and he also added Burton, Hardin and Blaine to his crew. The result, in november, was this memorable concert.Acoustic and insturmental arrangements are simply unique (better than ""an evening with JD"") and perfect female voices ""support"" all the songs. Yes, maybe only 15 songs are a little bit few and maybe some hits are missing (where are ""I'd rather be a cowboy"" or ""Matthew""?)... But you still have JD' sketches with the audience and a lot of good music in amazing versions...! A quite-rare MUST HAVE!TOP: Rocky Mountain High and Calypso (incredible arrangements!!!)FLOP: Take Me Home, Country Roads (not a great version)"
5,new bernstein,"interesting, fun, lively and different way to listen to West Side Story. I loved the jazzy part and the pianists were excellent."
4,Got to the point,Brief explanations for each segment in US History. I shared this with my teen that was bored with history texts and wanted to get to the point. He remembers dates and significant periods more easily. Glad I bought it.
5,Wonderful muffins with this!,"This is the best muffin pan we have ever used! Even heat, assists in the rising, everything it is said to be, it is."
5,Super Great Rare Compact Disc!,Shenandoah is one of the greatest all time country groups of all time in my opinion. Unfortunately these guys are no longer together and that is just too bad. This compact disc is one that will stay in your cd changer or automobile cd player that is for sure. I would recommend this compact disc to any one who is looking for rare good country music.
5,Historical facts can't be denied,"This book is simply awesome! Finaly one book that gives us the opportunity to read something else but simple armenian official propaganda. Mr Weems used first hand armenian sources and documents to write his book, and ironicaly, thanks to his book, the liers proved their own lies.I really advice every single person who cares about justice, historical truth and wants to fight against revisionism to read this book.Let's hope Armenia and the Armenian diaspora soon recognizes the Azeri genocide."
1,Hitler would have loved it!,"A crucial element of Hitler's thesis Mein Kampf was his contention that if one is to tell a lie that the lie be so big that no one would ever think it false.This is seemingly the underlying motivation behind the authorship of this book.What's next,that the Jews committed mass suicide just to implicacte the Nazis? The content of this book is not worthy of intellectual discourse. The book flies in the face of accepted historical facts and common sense. For the author to slap the common face of the victims of the Armenian Genocide with this ludicrous book is to perpetuate the final phase of genocide. That final insult being to deny that it ever happened."
1,Author has no leg to stand on,Nothing but manipulation of events and hateful propaganda. If he had done any objective research he would quickly find the truths instead of propagate more lies. Why does this even exist?
1,why would an Armenian WANT to buy this book?,"Why would an Armenian want to buy this book? That would just be financially supporting an author who is writing books about things that are not only believed to be false, but stir up feelings of anger and disgust.Furthermore, there are some serious questions about Mr. Weems' credentials. I suggest you read this link for more information:[...]I'm Armenian. Send me a copy for free (or better yet, publish the book on a website) and I'll read it with an open mind."
1,Weems Has No Credibility,"Let us review who Weems is:(1) a disbarred Arkansas lawyer(2) disbarred while holding the office of prosecuting attorney for mixing his clients' money with his own (the gravest of acts for a lawyer)(3) a year later he was convicted of arson and conspiring to defraud an insurance firm.In most states, these facts reflect such moral turpitude that you would be permitted to question Mr. Weems' credibilty and the truthfulness of any testimony he gives. I encourage you to do so here, as well.Now we know what Weems is, but what is he not? He is not a scholar. He is not a historian at all. He is not a researcher. He is not an eyewitness. In fact, he doesn't hold even a single qualification that would make it worth anyone's time to read his opinions and conjecture.Don't bother. Save your $5. I happened upon it at a library (it's not easy to find, with good reason). It's just a book full of hate speech."
1,this book was a waste of my time...,"the Armenian Genocide did occur...its a fact...im not Armenian but WHY would an entire culture lie? and Armenians terrorists? that contradicts itself...throughout history and philosophers (Kant, Nachen etc etc) have always stated that Armenians are kind people who just live their own peaceful lifestyle. and i know lot of Turkish people who do admit that ""the armenian genocide did occur""...there ARE pictures to prove it...and currently the ARmenians are getting destroyed in their own land by Turks and others...""let the truth be known""- Immortal Technique"
1,Sad Hateful Propaganda,"Samuel Weem's book is more analogous to The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion than any legitimate text dealing with history. Even as a work of genocide denial it is vitriolic and paranoid. ""Secrets of a Christian Terrorist State"" is not a good source to see the so-called ""other side"" of the genocide debate; it is only useful to those who want to see an inflammatory racist diatribe masquerading as a work about history. Should any ""historian"" be believed when he tells immigrants to go home and claims that an entire race has a ""Master Plan"" of hatred?Make no mistake, this is racist propaganda, and Samuel Weems is not the sort of person that any country should be proud of."
1,Hate and Ignorance,"This book is based on racism and hatred, written by a convicted felon and a disbared lawer who makes no secret of his hatred of the Armenians, and stamps the Armenians with such racial labels as ""terrorists,"" ""liars,"" ""tellers of untruth."" He singles out individual cases of Armenian collaborationism in Nazi ranks (totally ignoring thefact that around 300 000 Armenians dies among Soviet ranks fighting the Nazis, and that a number of famous Soviet generals -- such as Isakov, Babajanian, Baghramian, Mikoyan -- were all of Armenian origin) to somehow ""prove"" that the Armenian genocide never took place. Overall, an incompetent and miserable effort of racial propaganda.p.s. at some point he goes as far as telling the American-Armenians ""to go back to Armenia."" Do you immagine the author of a book your purchaised telling the African-Americans ""go back to Africa""?? Where does this man stop?!"
1,TERRIBLE,I purchased two c.d.s...they took the cardboard cover from one c.d. to place it over the other to hide the face that they gave me the wrong c.d. SUPER CLASSY. Thank you for ripping me off for $7.00. You're a winner...thank you for making never want to purchase from Amazon again for the fear some jerk will rip me off.
4,"awesome, but gets boring on repeat","this is a great cd, but it gets really boring when you listen to it over and over again. after a while, the tunes kind of start running together. in the world of alternative music, i'd say that all time low was a terrific breath of fresh air when this cd came out. they used to have their own sound, but now all pop-punk sounds just like them. in reality, these guys are really jerks and have no respect for their fans. i was supposed to interview them a few years ago for a magazine i worked for and they blew me off to go smoke weed."
3,Average,"All time low are nothing you haven't heard before, but becuase they never claimed to be original or unique, I'll cut em' a break.Basically, if you like Hit The Lights or (old) Fall Out Boy, you'll probably like All Time Low and the ""put up or shut up EP"".All Time Low are out to pick up where fall out boy sadly dropped off with ""from under the cork tree"". Recommended.Lyrics 2/5Music 4/5Production 3/5Staying Power 5/5Originality 1/5"
3,pretty decent,"all time low plays some solid pop punk, but this e.p. doesnt stick to me like i want it to.the music is great, it just doesnt seem to be catchy.personally, i prefer the academy is... or armor for sleep.but hey!get this cd, its worth checking out."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have a ton of calphalon bakeware and this is the only item I hate. I am used to baking on the darker finish but these are impossible to use. When I make drop biscuts the bottoms burn before the middle is done. They are fine for cookies but not everything. Also, if you ever burn something on the sheet, that is the end of it. The non-stick finish is runied after just one error. They are too expensive to be ruined after one bad batch. Save your money and buy less expensive ones."
1,burnt cookies,I recently bought Calphalon cookie sheets based on their reputation. I splurged thinking I'd be getting the best. Wrong! The first batch of chocolate chip cookies was black on the bottom. I've tried adjusting the temperature and time in oven. I have yet to get the great results I used to get with my 20 yr. old insulated cookie sheets that I recently ruined. I'm afraid I will have to abandon this envestment and break down and buy cookie sheets that give quality results.
1,Surprisingly Bad,"I always expect good things from Calphalon, but this cookie sheet does not deliver. It is flimsy, most things stick to it, and almost everything burns on the bottom before the tops are done. I was so surprised after I used it the first time that I actually rechecked to make sure it really *was* Calphalon. This was a disappointment and I don't recommend it."
1,great idea (but poorly executed),"great idea: easy to adjust resistance band excercise kitpoor execution: the metal clip on the handles bent out of shape. not much later the plastic cilp on one of the bands snapped off in mid-excercise (and i was very lucy the band and pieces did not fly into my face as they release much force).oh, and this was all on the first day of use.this might not be a problem if you only use the lighter bands --i was using the black heavyweight band, but i'm not some super muscle man, this should not have happened if better care and testing had been taken in quality of material and manufacture.as for the sellers, it arrived fine and quick, too bad the product did not live up to the most basic expectations."
1,poor quality product and delivery,the bag was shipped in a box without packing material. the corn cobs have arrived with half of the kernels knocked of the cobs and in the bottom of the bag. the corn cobs are brittle and very difficult to attach to the corn cob hanger. i will not purchase this product again.
4,Slow Hope by Anita Swanson,"If you've ever been female, you will identify with Slow Hope, the debut novel from Anita Swanson. Based on events from Swanson's life, this is a moving story of a nave young girl named Anne who, on the verge of womanhood, seeks to escape the torments of an abusive upbring-only to find herself caught in an impossible relationship that twists and turns into an equally disturbing scenario.With Anne's world crumbling around her, she turns to the only device that has never left her nor has ever been taken away-something that is uniquely hers-her faith.This is a page turning story, deftly written with great insight and movement and an absolutely terrific first-time achievement."
5,The Legends live perfomance,"This classic band or should I say these legends do a outstanding live performance in Madison Square Garden 1972. This record is worth a listen only for the harmonies and lead vocal but there is these amazing set of songs of the early rock and roll era that are a joy to hear.So if you want to listen one of the best lead performers in rock history , Dion, and one of the best vocal doo wop groups ever , the Belmonts, give a try to this record.You won't repent."
4,"Love the series, but editor needed!","I have books 1-6 on Kindle, and I am indeed officially hooked. I enjoy the writing style and storyline...the historical fact blended with the fiction. Purchased 5 Kindle books upon finishing the free Book 1 in the series and I am enjoying them immensely. THANK YOU! :)Note to Author: Sweetie, you desperately need an editor.It's not ""would of"", it's *would have* or *would've*. This error is pervasive throughout the series regardless of the speaker."
3,'Mill Town' Okay - Not Great,"This book is the second in a series by P. B. Ryan, called ""A Gilded Age Mystery"". The story takes place in 1868 Boston, which makes it immediately interesting. Main character, Nell Sweeney, is a governess to a rich family. When parents of a missing girl come to the mistress of the house for help in finding her, Nell takes on the task. Characters are good and well-rounded. The character of Nell strikes me as a bit far-fetched when she fights off a bad guy. She's supposed to be this gorgeous lady, and how she overpowers him is frankly not believable. The book lacks humor but is otherwise well written. The author refers back to the first book in the series a lot, but I see no advantage in having to read Number One first. Good climax at the end."
4,Morder in Mill Town,I enjoyed the book although I am not a fan of murder mysteries. It was a book club selection. It was easy reading and really held my attention.
4,another Nell Sweeney,"I liked this book, but it was a bit over the top at the end. Still, worth reading,lot's of developments for Nell's character. Some things in the plot made me feel like I had missed a book in between but since this is book 2 and I read book 1, I guess that the author intended to have a jump in time and just fill you in on what happened."
4,Good value,Easy reading mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed. Great value for money. I will be working my way through the whole series.
4,A little different,I liked the book. It had some historic interest. I was interested enough to buy another from the series and liked it too.
4,Easy read,Good story but similar to many others of the same type. It was an easy read and enjoyable. Good for a rainy day escape.
4,And the story goes on....with me wanting more,Really enjoyed the story of this book. Nell Sweeney is not is be underestimated. I believe there lies a little of Nell Sweeney in us all. This is a tale about murder and the mystery thickens and you will NOT believe or ever guess who the murderer is. Nell and Will are definitely in love.....
4,Good historical mystery series,"I read the first in this series because it was free on Kindle and sounded interesting. That had me hooked, enjoy the characters, and the time period. Good marketing for authors who have a long series and want new readers. Now I have purchased others and look forward to more adventures."
3,"Nell Sweeney,book 2","I had never read any of her books before, but have thoroughly enjoyed book 1 and book 2.They are light reading and fast reading."
5,A worthy successor to Still Life with Murder,"Having loved STILL LIFE WITH MURDER, the first book in P.B. Ryan's series about a governess of dubious background in post-Civil War Boston, I couldn't wait to read its sequel, MURDER IN A MILL TOWN. I was not disappointed. All the first book's virtues can be found here: Nell Sweeney, the smart, tough heroine; Will Hewitt, her equally smart, equally damaged sidekick and possible love interest; a twisty-turny-gotcha plot; and the sometimes lush, sometimes gritty atmospherics that made the first book such a vivid reading experience. Not only does Ryan present an intriguing mystery story but she weaves fascinating threads of back-story through the book. We learn more about Nell's past and we come to understand why she is so determined not just to hide that past but to rise above it. This book is a natural and worthy successor to the first book. What a joy to know that DEATH ON BEACON HILL, the next book in the series, is on my Kindle, waiting for me."
2,"1 star for price, 1 for maybe I broke it but that would only be a result of poor quality in the first place","Jury is still out because I need to tear everything down again to debug the latest problem, but most likely the dimmer failed after about 2 weeks of use. it has to be the dimmer though because it's a lamp: wire, bulb and switch - nothing more to question here. No I didn't change bulbs - I verified continuity with a meter.Quality compared to the module it replace was several steps down (all plastic cover knob, shaft, housing) The only metal I found in the unit was the nut to attach and the wiring. It was working at first but the detent for the off position wouldn't work immediately after it was installed. Now that works but the dimmer is dead."
2,Stay away - there are better alternatives,"The dimmer/switch is made of cheap plastic. Description of the item, on Amazon, does not mention that the switch fits only 3/8"" mounting holes. This is revealed only after you open the sealed package. I had to shave the threaded portion of the plastic switch to match the 1/4"" inch hole in the pole of the lamp. Regardless, the switch is too short to accommodate the inside and outside locking nuts snd the knob. I had to prop the entire switch inside the pole with a piece of wood and made it work, eventually. However, I would never bought it, in the first place, had all the product dimensions and quality of materilas were provided upfront. I think there are better alternatives out there but, as usual, you get what you pay for."
5,Worked as advertised!,Item packaged with all parts needed to replace original dimmer. Easy to install.Torchiere floor lamp now back in service at minimal expense and effort.
1,maybe bad luck,"Mine came in a opened package, didn't work on the install, removed to to test with multimeter, I think its a DOA product. No luck with customer service so far. The fit and finish is a perfect replacement, if I can get one that works."
4,It is working,"They put cheap switches in these halogen torchieres, they don't last much longer than the bulbs. All the replacement options look the same. We will see if it lasts."
2,viennese albumn,Due to misdirection (sent to someone else at another address in error by amazon) this was received very much after the end date. The supplier did send another cd with other cds in apology. All were received in good condition if later than expected.
5,Favourite Earrings!,"I love these earrings. They've been my favourites since I received them a month ago. I've worn them horseback riding and to fancy dinners. They're not bulky looking, the pearl is prettier than in the picture and it's on a loop set behind the gem so it can dance fetchingly when you toss your head. Fiddle-dee-dee. The peridot has a dimensional, glowy look and just happens to catch the colour of my eyes perfectly. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
3,Cute collection of her movie quotes,"There are a few good things in here. But it wasn't what I expected it to be. I thought it would be more than a collection of quotes from her books. Why not just read the books or watch the movies? Still, there were some very good quotes in here."
5,One of my very favorite books!,"Jessie, Lizzie Mag, Ada and Maureen are roommates (and best friends) at Alveara boarding school in Belfast, Northern Ireland. They have always loved their teacher, Miss Muller, who looks like Vivien Leigh. But now World War II is in action, and Miss Muller is part German. Jessie and her friends have reason to believe that the beautiful Daphne Muller is a spy for Hitler. But Jessie can't help but love Miss Muller, no matter what everyone else says about her. Where should her loyalty be? With her country, or with her true heart? This is a beautiful story. Everyone should read it."
3,Pretty good!,This book was good but it could have been better. After all that talk about Miss Muller being a spy it turned out that she wasn't. It got kinda boring at parts but it wasn't horrible. Some people may like it and some people might not. I thought it was good.
3,Spying on Miss Muller,The book spying on Miss Muller it didn't turn out the way i thought it would turn out. I thought she was a spy. I also didn't like how they went on about Miss Muller was a spy. Somethings in the book Ithought they shouldn't have added. I wouldn't say this really had to do with jews were treated. They did explain alittle bit about how jews felt toward half Germans. I dont think this was a very well writen book by Eve Bunting. I think she could have writen more about the Holocaust. So I think a three star rating is all this book is worth.
4,Spying on Miss Muller,It was a good book and it was very suspenseful. i liked reading it because it was an even mix of all different subjects. I had a lot of fun reading it and I wish there was a sequel. I liked reading about Jessie and her friends. I like the charecter Greta. She has a ong story behind her but Eve Bunting makes the story of Greta very short and vague. All in all i think this was a good book and I would reccomend it to most people who enjoy reading about World War 2.
2,UGGHHH,"well i am having so many problems with this item that i don't know what to do, the software that it came with will not work with my windows vista computer, (i think that maybe vista is the real one at fault here,)but it was working for a little while, kind of,but it suddenly stopped, anyway i've just about everything, even restoring the system to factory settings, which is always a last resort for me, NOTHING. anyone have any ideas aside from buying another modem?"
2,Calphalon Convenience but Poor Baking Results,"After several weeks of use, I've also found that these sheets tend to burn dough on the bottom long before you see any hint of any browning around the edges. This has caused us problems on several established recipes and the sheets don't seem to allow for any workaround, i.e. lower oven temperature and/or shorter bake time.Like all Calphalon, they clean up very easily but what's the point if you can't trust them with your food in the first place?PROS* Extremely reliable nonstick surfaces and durable construction as you'd expect from CalphalongCONS* Uneven baking results will leave you with lots of ""surprise"" burnt items."
3,Cookie sheets are ok,"I agree that these cookie sheets make it too dificult to make the perfect cookie. If they are the done in the middle, the edges are too crispy. I recently started doing the Pampered Chef thing and now I always bake on my stones! It is a much more even distribution."
3,Eh,"I got these cookie sheets because I needed some - but I've been really disappointed with them. Most of the reviews are right for the most part - they do have a fantastic non-stick finish and they do stack easily in the cupboard. My problem with them is that whenever I make cookies with them, my cookies are burned on the bottom and barely done on the top. Also, they are a little TOO big and I have a difficult time washing them after usage. They don't fit very well in the sink at all. Overall I give them 3 stars because they don't work well for me - but they are as advertised."
1,Cookie Sheets was shipped damaged. Twice!,"I ordered the cookie sheets a couple weeks ago. When I received it, one corner was bend. Amazon shipped the cookie sheets only in Calphalon's box. They did not ship them in a padded Amazon box. I emailed Amazon to complain, and I returned it. They sent me a replacement which I received today. They still shipped it only in Calphalon's box. The replacement cookie sheets are also bent. But the bent is in the middle and not as noticable. They assured me the replacement would be undamaged. It is not true. It is damaged."
2,NOT NONSTICK!!!,"These cookie sheets look great, until you use them. They are not non-stick unless you grease them GENEROUSLY. Then the grease bakes on and you cannot get it off. This happened after only using a few times and washing them immediately after use. They are also hard to clean because they are too big to immerse in a kitchen sink and not recommended for the dishwasher (they wouldn't fit in one anyway!). I agree that it is hard to make a good cookie with these. The bottoms are always over done. And it is hard to get the cookies off the sheet without damaging them."
1,Boo! These Stink!,"These sheets are quite impressive visually-they appear to be of high quality and sturdy. That's about it, though. They're great to look at, not use. I find that I have to lightly grease the sheets to ensure that cookies don't stick, even when the recipe doesn't call for it and these are supposed to be nonstick, after all. And when I do that, the spaces between the cookies get the grease baked on. I don't usually go by one or two bad reviews on a product, especially one that has alot of reviews, but I should have this time."
4,Calpahlon large baking sheets are great,I was hesitant to buy the Calphalon baking sheets after reading some of the negative reviews. I baked over a dozen cookies yesterday and today and not one batch burned. The cookies all were evenly gold on the bottom.I have to say that Amazon didn't care about the packaging and shipping of my sheets. They slapped a label on the original manufacturer box and shipped it. One of the sheets came slightly bent. And the boxes were sitting in the rain on my front step from UPS.I do have to say that I am overall satisfied with the cookie sheets. The price was certainly a steal compared to buying them individually at a retail store. And I have learned not to believe that a product is not great based on one negative Amazon review. Buy them and try them for yourself. They worked fine for me.
2,Everything burns on these cookie sheets!,"I received two of these cookie sheets as a gift and was excited because I have many other Calphalon Commercial products and love them. I would not recomment these cookie sheets. Everything I bake on them burns on the bottom! I've tried adjusting the baking times, and moving the oven racks and nothing works. If I bake something long enough for it to be cooked through, the bottom get black."
4,wrong item. great service.,i ordered a battery for my phone. but unfortunately i ordered the wrong thing. the service was fantastic as they sent me the address and confirmation number very promptly. then i received a call about a week later from them saying i accidentally send a rebate form to them that was supposed to go somewhere else. they were nice enough to send the rebate out for me to the correct address. i would recommend them on their service alone.
4,Chuuuuubbito,"damn crisp pic, its even picking up hd channels it shouldnt, just got an upconversion hdmi dvd player for 99$ only down side was the cost of the cable... excellent picture quality nice features i think i will get the 40 for my living room! pc inputs like a charm... only prob is the resolution is a bit odd... desktop has no problem but the notebook i have to drop down the res a little .... all in all a killer monitor/tv replacement."
3,For entertainment purposes only...if that!,"Well, I can say that I am still waiting for this book to get exciting. Even for fiction, it is not that exciting. I agre with some of the other reviewers; I was looking into some more of the historical accounts of an era that is hard to find decent historical accounts, and I guess I will still be looking after this book.It is hardly worth finishing."
2,A pale historical account,This is a book long on accounts of parties and gossipy tidbits and short on historical accounts Dolley must have felt real horror as the British approached but this was not really portrayed in the book. Her servants seemed much more frightened. Dolley was more concerned with the politics of the day than with actual living. Altogether this book would not be missed if not read
3,Not bad!,"I hate ""best of..."" albums. This one is perfect example why. There are a lot of very good Restless songs and of course a lot of crap! All the original Restless songs are great, and a few covers (Long Black SHiny Car, Baby Please Don't Go). But other songs...hmm. This is maybe a good Restless record for someone who doesn't know them or it is not a rockabilly-die-hard-fan. But for die hard fans this is an offence!"
4,"Too Pink, But Great","This is a good introduction to Restless. Mark Harman is a stupidly under-rated guitarist and deserved far, far greater success.There's a healthy balance of tracks across albums, and a couple of interesting live tracks. One attempt at rampant pop commercialism (You're Just An Echo) and dull cover aside, I'd heartily recommend this album to anyone. Anywhere. In the world.Did you *ever* pay your Poll Tax? :)"
2,Good overview but little substance,"This book is good as far as it goes, however, overall I was disappointed by this particular Dave Vedder work. It provides a good overview of the subject but lacks the specific and detailed information that I have come to expect from books by this specialist publisher. For example, you will find very little information to assist making a rod purchase decision (and float rods are expensive due to their length!). Given the small size, few pages, and lack of real substance, I consider this book to be very overpriced.My recomendation is to instead purchase ""Jig Fishing for Steelhead & Salmon"" which is also written by Dave Vedder. This is very detailed and comprehensively written and includes the information of value from his float fishing book."
3,Walking with God Day by Day,I had expected more of a devotional book....similar to Jesus Calling by Sarah Young. It's a far way from that book!
4,Walking with God Day by Day: 365 Daily Devotional Selections,"For someone seeking an early morning devotion this little book is perfect. I have read several of Dr. Lloyd-Jones' books and have thoroughly enjoyed them all. To have selections from a variety of his works is very nice. It does, however, leave me wanting to read the books from which these selections have been taken."
3,poor puppy,"Jess and Liz take care of a lovely dog for a while and find scratches and bruises all over him.They realize his horrible owner has been abusing him,and the dog's fear of people makes this all the more obvious.Jessica,Elizabeth and their male friend Ken are all deeply concerned for the dog and the last thing they plan to do is give him back to the mean man who hit him.But they don't know WHAT to do.When the twins started their dog-sitting service,Mr. and Mrs. Wakefield made it clear they didn't want to be bothered by any hassles,that it was the girls' responsibility.They hadn't expected such a true problem though.But the twins choose to work out a way to save the dog on their own."
2,Very Terse,"Perl Pocket Reference only gives lists and tables. No explanation of how to use the various functions, variables, etc. Definitely not for new-comers.I was very disappointed by this pocket reference. I was expecting something more like the very high quality ""Python Pocket Reference"", which manages to give complete description of the language, all functions, standard modules, etc, ALONG WITH EXAMPLES FOR EACH; The Python Pocket Reference is able to be used as a standalone reference. This is definitely not true for the Perl Pocket Reference; You will need other books to make this pocket reference make sense... what a pain!"
1,Unhappy,"Of the many O'Reilly books that I have purchased,this is the first one that was really poor.I'd give it -5 stars, but the lowest you allow is 1.The author seemed more interested in being cleverand funny, then imparting information.However, I also have two very large Perl booksthat are also almost useless, so maybe it'sa Perl problem."
1,"Calphalon 9"" roud cake pan(Y3109)","Do not waste your $ on this pan.I had to return it to the store.The side bakes much faster then the center of the pan.As the matter of the fact, the center of the cake was still not baked properly after the time was up in my convection oven.Other cheaper brands of bakeware performed much better."
1,lacking description details,Which specific model?The photos shows all models and no details on the type of thread (male/female)?
3,"Replacement miter gauge-gage for 3/8"" x 3/4"" slots","The only disappointment with this product is that this miter gauge bar is not 3/8 inch thick as it claimed to be. We had to sand it down, so that it would flush evenly in the 3/8"" deep slot. Can't complain that it sells only for $30.00."
2,Not that good,Man I bought this cd thinking tha it would be like all of other Master P CD's - but it's not. Alot of the songs are from the 60's and 70's and personally I really don't care for those type of songs. If i wanted something like that i would've bought Marvin Gayes greatest hits!!!!!
4,Not too foolish...,This soundtrack gives a good cross-section of what No Limit has going on in the studios and I really liked the old skool tracks from some of the original funk-masters. I liked this CD but there were times when the 'next track' button was handy. I definatly wouldn'y pay list price for this however.
4,It's Aright,Yea I Just checked out the Foolish Soundtrack and its aright. I give him props for putting the old skool tracks. Keep on making dough P!
2,Not a Documentary,"I thought this was going to be more of a documentary, but it is more of a fictional story about a team visiting the planets in the solar system. Not the most entertaining, and it doesn't seem scientifically sound. Though for 8 dollars the visuals and story quality were'nt bad at all. Not a total waste."
3,OK drama science DVD.,"It is not as good as ""Race to Mars,"" but it is a fascinating DVD documentary and fiction. If we do venture throughout the entire solar system, most likely, it would not be done in one trip, but a multiple number of trips.Joseph Y. LeeBachelor of Arts, 1994Physics and Applied MathUniversity of California, Berkeley"
5,this is very very good,"I bought this in a clearance rack. Figured what the heck.it is truly excellent. Great, realistic effects. Great presentation, kinda reality tv/documentary but where most simliar edutainment products don't pull that off, this one really does.do it."
1,Depressing and inaccurate,"I was looking forward to this DVD, after seeing the fascinating BBC website and the very nice book (which by the way gave me a credit, for helping them with some photos of Venus).I was dissapointed in the show itself, which was depressing and riddled with technical mistakes and inaccuracies. I expect some fact checking from the BBC, but you cannot trust any statement or figure in this program. For example, the Russians landed on Venus 10 times, with the two Vega landers being the last. How could they get basic facts like that wrong? Going from Mars past the Sun to pick up speed -- energetically impossible and it wouldn't provide any speed boost.The show presents failure after failure, with almost every mission ending in near death. Just not very fun or educational or factual. Written by labor-party leftists I suppose, with weak science backgrounds, we get two hours of their anti-science sentiment."
2,Nothing special,"This mask is very lightweight and flexable, but is made to fit somebody with a jawstructure like an Easter Island statue. if you know anything about molding and modifying rubber/latex costume parts, then this would make a great base for a project, but dont buy this mask if you are just looking for a Batman mask to finish your costume.Still, it does look just like the picture, so they dont advertise it as being anything magnificent. I gave 2 stars just for honesty from the seller. Just make sure you fill the ears with some kinda of material so they dont collapse."
1,hate it,"does not form well to the head, really lose fitting and had to go with something more for the party."
5,An Album that Every Bluesman must have!!,"This Album is part of blues history. If you don't have it, buy one. The experience of open a vinyl and play it for the first time is priceless. Vinyl is the way that old records where ment to be heard."
2,my son won't read,"As much as I love Mr. Rogers, for some reason my son will not let me read this to him. Maybe it is the real-life pictures instead of art work, I don't know. I think it seems good, but maybe for older than 2-years-old."
1,Outdated & Boring,"I bought this book based on the great reviews from other customers. But, I don't see what they see. I see parents and kids wearing clothes from the early 80's and information that can't possibly be more basic. There's nothing wrong with the basics, but there are plenty of books that give the basics and more in a creative and entertaining way. Well ... at least it was cheap!"
4,"Decent book, outdated photos (not surprising)","I wanted a potty book for my child that had pictures of real kids (not animals or cartoons) using the potty and this seemed like the only one I could find! You can't go wrong with Mr. Rogers, the book might be a bit too wordy for my 2yr old, but she does ""read"" it herself at least daily. I like how she can see other children using the potty, my only issue (as others have mentioned) is that the material is pretty outdated, but you kind of know that before purchasing just based on the cover photo. This book would have been current when I was a kid! I'm not expecting this book to potty train my kid, but I am sure that it has helped associate waste elimination with sitting on the potty.I would have given 5 stars if it was more modernized - it's still WAY more modern than the ""Once Upon a Potty"" book, I mean that kid is sitting on a chamber pot..."
4,good book,You gotta love Mr. Rogers.My son enjoys reading this book....now why won't he go on that potty?!?
5,Potty Training Mr. Rogers THE BEST BOOK OUT THERE !,"Mr. Rogers is the best thing for the world we live in. He brings back understading , love, and trust to our children in the world. Please get all his books, dvds, etc..."
5,"A wonderful, comforting book from Mr. Rogers",My daughter and I love this book. In fact it is her favorite Potty learning book. Mr. Rogers presents potty learning as part of a child's growing up. Parents help the child along his/her way to independence. It is low pressure with lots of photos of real children. My daughter asks me to read this book a couple of times a day. I was very impressed with this book.
3,"Too stero-typical, i think","I think this movie is too Stero-typica, it has it's funny moments, but, I dint know, its not that grand!"
4,A Must See for any gay guy looking for love in a st8? world,"Lights, camera, Polaroid! Billy's look for love is joined in this light-hearted comedy by his lightly homoerotic-fulfilling photography, fag hag friends, older gay mentor, and obsession over his male model subject Gabriel, but not knowing if he's ""in the club"". The movie has many coming-of-queer nuances that lets every gay man say ""yep, I did the same thing.""The movie follows a definite story line (that's a good thing) with some oh-so-attractive guys and gals. When the credits roll by, you'll have the feeling of ""wow, that movie was actually alot better than I thought it would be."" Four stars as far as it relates to other G&L flicks."
1,"Just awful, I couldn't watch the whole thing...","First off, I am a gay man- but WHY do all 'gay films' have to involve hairless, young twits AND somehow involve a drag queen? Whew. I tried on this one... the intro is rather fun and involving (a voice-over and a series of polaroids), but after that...I simply did not CARE to spend the next (endless?) however long with these characters...(the home shopping channel sounded good!)... I know there was 'buzz' on this movie, and missed in the theater...now I am glad I did- there are some wonderful indie movies out there- this was not one of them..."
2,ok but not great,"this movie was ok but kind of depressing the whole show builds up to this one thing that never happens and there is not munch of a happy ending, sean was great in it, a very diffrent chracter"
3,A romping good time!,"I bought this movie because 1)I LOVE anything Matthew Ashford and 2) Sean Hayes is hysterically funny!Poor Billy's life is a shambles. His career is nosediving and his love life needs a boost. Enter sweet (and sexy) Gabriel who transforms (without ever actually succeeding) in making Billy's dreams come true.It is a story of unrequitted love and dashed dreams. You might cry at how, no matter what Billy tries, he can never seem to catch a break. We root for the underdog, and at the end, we are all rewarded because Billy's life finally gets better."
3,A fun movie,"Maybe it is just me, but this movie just wasn't what I expected. Don't get me wrong, it was an enjoyable little flick, but on the whole I was a little dissapointed. With Sean Hayes as the star I was expecting to be rolling on the floor with laughter, however this was more of a light drama than a comedy. Most of the humour relied on the association factor of ""been there, done that"" and the normally hilarious Mr Hayes played a basically ""straight"" (only in one sense of the word) role.My recommendation for those considering the purchase of this DVD is to rent it first. I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, but don't think it is one of those movies I will watch over and over again."
3,a Nice Film,"This film was enjoyable to sit through. Sean Hayes, in his pre Will and Grace life did quite a nice job as Billy, the photographer with the crush on his straight friend. Most of the supporting characters were well done and well acted. Some of the scenes were almost painful to watch, Billy and the object of his affection laying platonically in bed, Billy makes his move, the friend lets him then tells him to stop. A nice film with some funny moments that had the guts to not have a sugary ending."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,I have seen this movie a few times and it is a great movie. Ipersonaly identify with the lead character (Sean Hayes) but even ifyour not gay this is an awesome movie. Tommy O'Haver (Writer and Director) did a fabulous job with the movie. I searched for this movie for a long time. This movie will defently be spending a lot of time in my VCR.
5,New Queer Cinema? How about just a great film?,"Sean Hayes is awesome. Imagine a story that puts all of your hip, witty, weird and cool friends together and explores relationships and the snappy comments and cynicism that goes along with it. Add some great photography and the requisite beautiful people and you have a great movie. I want a copy of this to show friends. There is just too much to like here! Maybe there really is someone for everyone...keep looking!"
4,"Before ""Will"" Sean Had Grace","Sean P. Hayes proves his comical skill in this farce that is part camp, part love story. Hayes falls in love with Gabrielle, a man who might be gay or straight. Good ole Gabe is comfused, Hayes is in love and the world is a happy, happy place as long as you have a poloroid camera. You'll have to see the movie to get the reference. Good characters and good writing make this a comic gem."
5,I wish my life was so pleasant ...,I can not really say much more about this movie but Billy & Gabriel were GREAT! A real life situation for a NORMAL gay life. Nothing to glaring. I get a warm fuzzy feeling every time I see this movie and have seen it at least five times. I will watch it again as well.
4,Absolutely Fabulous,"This is a great little film. Sean P. Hayes (Will & Grace) is wonderful to watch. His performance here is much more toned down than his television alter ego Jack but is just as likeable. An adorable little gay, romance that does what so many other films of its kind fail to do: present a gay love story that's more concerend with ""love story"" rather than gay."
5,"Great Film ~Very funny, artistic, and charm!!!! MUST SEE!!!","First, I though it's just another GAY Film with all gay attitude BUT it's not. I love it. I watch it again and again and I still LOVE IT. It's the charmest film in last year that I have seen. I cannot wait to see another film from Tommy O'Haver. This is A MUST SEE either you are Gay or NOT."
3,Average,"Mostly interviews, some music footage from concerts. Suggested for the hardcore Sublime fan, not the commercially entertained."
3,All of their live music sounds bootleged,Most of sublmes live music sounds bootleged so if you have any of their live music you wolnt notic any dirrerence
5,Very touching...makes me glad I love Sublime!!,"I think this video is great for anyone who loves sublime or wants to know more...There's a bunch of stories from Gwen Stefani (as well as a few preformances w/ her and ND)Pennywise, Troy, Ron Jeremy...the list goes on. It really makes me realize how great Brad was and how sad that it is that he's gone. It's good for any collector or fan and well worth the price, although it's not HIGH quality, it's LONG and filled with alot of good stories."
1,Packing broke this rating!!,"I liked the product description but very disappointed that I have received it armless with smashed pieces that are useless to glue together. The product was not packed very well (wrapped in a plastic wrap) and placed in an overly sized box that contain a small bubble support that the mermaid can not even use as a pillow!!!The item price is good but because of it, and I don't think it is worth returning !The item finishing is nice, but again, easily scratched, and broken (as even before unboxing) :("
4,From a Native American Partcipant,I was also involved in putting the Sword of Heaven. I am a Native American religious teacher. I placed the Kami at the Trinity site in New Mexico. The subtle beauty and integral integrity of this story is a great study for those living in an increasingly mannerless and faith-less American Society. I strongly recomend this book to those whose hearts really believe in Peace..... Turtle Heart Ojibway Ahnishikad
5,Celebration of an Opportunity.,"Reading ""The Sword Of Heaven"" gave me an opportunity to celebrate with the author an event that comes to very few beings on the planet. He could have given up so many times and not resumed taking up what intuitively urged him to go on and perhaps helped all of us who sincerely wish we could participate in such an undertaking. Thank you for having the courage to respond to your inner longings and for writing this book which lets us know that there is daily uplifting of consciousness on the planet happening on a global scale.We are deeply moved and grateful that you celebrated this opportunity."
1,buy a different one,"The recipes are only 20 minutes worth of prep if you happen to have all of her odd and exotic ingredients on hand, particularly spices. I would have to wait for the mail order spices to arrive or visit a gourmet store a few hours away.The recipes also include a lot of pizza and omelettes, things that are probably in every other vegetarian cookbook, or even Betty Crocker. I bought this along with the Italian Vegetarian cookbook two months ago. I use the Italian one regularly and haven't used Rose Elliot's book once."
4,Nice Case!,"I've been carrying my h4155 around in this case for the past month. The case works very well. The flap on the case is held down by velcro and the form fits the pda pretty well. I carry the case on my belt all the time and it seems to function as advertised. It could have a softer interior, but I haven't noticed any issues yet."
2,Wow that's some loud velcro,"So I really like this case besides the velcro. Basically I have it with me all the time and use it frequently. The only thing is that each time I take my hp ipaq 4155 out, the velcro makes the loudest noise I have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case. I wouldn't recommend this one... I am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips."
2,$5 case fo $20,Poorly designed. I slide my 2400 into it and the case is so tight it pressess buttons on my iPaq for me. Turning it on in the case. Cheaply constructed. You can buy better for less. Check out the cases [...]
2,You hear me talking.,"This album by Jandek was released in 2002. It features Jandek alone, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar (and occasionally harmonica). It has a similar sound to his earlier albums, although he sounds noticeably older here. There are only five songs, but they are all long songs, each being between eight and twelve minutes. It is a difficult listen. I believe I coined the phrase ""uneasy listening"" to describe Jandek's music. This is the last of the 20 Jandek CD I bought for $80 (including shipping). So, I probably won't be reviewing any more Jandek albums, unless someone from Corwood Industries decides to send me review copies of other CDs."
3,Which story is one which CD?,"These stories are great but the CDs themselves really need to be labeled, rather than merely numbered, or (even an even better idea) give each story ONE CD! There are 8 stories and only 5 CDs, which means some stories are broken midway. It's frustrating for my kids who listen to these before bed, and for me, who has to change it just when I've gotten settled in for the few minutes of ""me"" time I get each night."
3,Disappointed,"Our Grandchildren love the series. Our 8 year old reads the books and our 4 year old goes to bed at night listening to her favorites on CD. We were spoiled, I guess, when Wendy's had a promo of 4 different books. Each had their own CD. We thought it was great to get more of these audiobooks from Amazon, until they arrived and 8 books were condensed into 5 CDs. Very child unfriendly. I guess we will be making our own CDs as well. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing. Books are great, just didn't think we would have technical problems."
4,My 6 year old son enjoys these,"My 6 year old son loves listening to these stories on CD during quiet time. Each book is like a history lesson in story form, so he has picked up quite a few interesting facts, much to my delight. Mary Pope Osborne reads these stories in a straighforward manner, with little drama and few voice changes for different characters, but my son really enjoys them, and requests them often. We have purchased several more in the series, and have been very pleased with them."
4,Great,"Only thing I would change would be to have each book on a separate CD. As it is now the 1st book starts and it just continues. Half-way through some of the books you have to change the cd. Not a deal breaker, but a little annoying. I have boys ranging from 5-11 and they all love to listen to these books in the car."
3,Hmm,"The children love these books and so we were all surprised that the recorded version was flat. I purchased the set for a ""road trip""; it just didn't hold the children's interest. So strange."
3,Great content but no track listings = frustrating,"We love Magic Tree House books and it is great to be able to listen to the author read them.However the implementation - 8 books on 5 CDs with no track listings is frustrating at best.I'm going to try copying and creating individual CDs per book as others suggested.Wish I had read the reviews a bit better so I knew this up front.All said it is a great price and great content, but if you are short on time it might be better to buy individual digital downloads versus this particular CD set."
1,Unusable,The disks are out of order and make no sense after the first 2. The other ones start in the middle of a story but I can't tell which story. Don't order this. Too confusing to try to skip ahead and find the right spot from which to continue.
3,"Great books, but Random House skimped on CDs","My kids and I love the Magic Tree House books! I can't give this audio book 5 stars, though, because of how Random House formatted the books on CDs. Rather than giving one CD per book, the 8 books are spread across 5 CDs. When my kids are listening to a book at bedtime, I don't want them to have to get up and change CDs halfway through a book, let alone try to find the start of a book in the middle of a CD. I wish Random house had spent the tiny bit of extra money to have one CD per book, and to print a picture of the book cover on each CD.I'm fixing the problem by making copies for my kids, including the tracks for each book on a separate CD, and printing labels using book cover images. For those who aren't technically savvy, this isn't the best solution. Random House, please think about the audience (4-8 year old kids) before skimping like this again."
3,Doesn't Come With Books,"I bought this cd set for my son who is seven and loves this series. However, we have been going to the library lately and checking out the books that you can read along with. I thought that this series was that type but unfortunantely it wasn't. I did give it three stars though because my son still listens to them when he goes to bed and does like the stories. But, am very dissappointed that I am now going to have to go out and buy all the books so he can follow along. I bought these mainly to help in his reading skills and it has turned out to be more like a listening skill instead. Oh Well. The cd's are great but just wanted to warn future shoppers that it does NOT come with the books, you have to buy those seperately."
4,Peaceful Car Trips and more.....,"I have four children - ages 5, 3 1/2, and 19 months (twins); I bought these cd's for the main purpose of making car rides more enjoyable and they worked like a charm. My two older children are asking to listen to the stories rather than watch TV, which is such a blessing! They are even asking to listen to them when they go to bed.The only downside is that some of the stories are split between 2 disks, which makes it difficult when they want to listen to a particular story at bedtime or if they want to listen to stories in different rooms.Overall the set was well worth the money!"
5,Very entertaining in the car,"My 3rd grader always had a hard time with reading chapter books. With the CD he loves listening to them and reading at the same time. When we are on the car, the children are so focus that we don't hear them fighting!!!It is a win-win situation."
3,Magic tree House,This product was not what I expected. I had to go to the store and buy the books so my granddaughter could read along with the CD. This was a little frustrating.
4,"Classic Autobiography, boring anyway","Goethe is a bit like broccoli--one should like him better than one actually does. Goethe goes to great lengths to credit everyone who helped him become the most important German author ever. It moves at a very slow pace. It also is somewhat self-deceptive and misleading, as it ends when Goethe was in his late 20's. In order to get a more accurate view of Goethe's life, Dichtung and Wahrheit is best read in conjunction with a traditional biography. Goethe's autobiography appears in 4 parts, and this volume consists of the first 3, which were written earlier, and it is more thorough than the 4th part that appears in volume 5 of this series. Anyone seriously interested in studying autobiography as a genre should read it, even if it is slow going."
1,fragments,"I love the author. He is brilliant, but unfortunately he airs his psychological dirty laundry with this book. Anyone who reads even a portion of this book and doesn't feel disturbed should seek therapy, especially the author. He obviously has unresolved issues with rejection from women manifested as a desire to take revenge and heal his wounds through submission and violence. Real sex is about a subtle play of submission and dominance, but never violence, and never ill will. When he realizes this, both he and his lovers will have a much better sex life.P.S. Any girl who 'wants to get raped,' or 'be used and abused,' has obviously had sexual trauma (ie. real rape) in her past, and probably when she was a child. Not as erotic anymore is it?P.S.S. Again, I love the authors work, but this book can do some serious damage if people read it and think that this kind of perspective is ok."
3,False advertising?,"When I first read about this ""translation"" of Mikra'ot Gedolot, I thought to myself: it can't be true. Chavel's English translation of RaMBaN's (Nachmanides) commentary on Shemot (Exodus) alone contains 626 pages of text. How in the world could all of that plus the other classical commentaries plus the original biblical text in Hebrew plus two translations of the biblical text all fit into a 349 page volume? The answer is that they don't. Just by checking the sample page available on the JPS website, I immediately saw that much of Ibn Ezra was missing. For all I know, this may be a very useful volume. However, if you think that it really offers translations of all the materials that appear in a real Mikra'ot Gedolot - think again."
5,Fascinating insights into Exodus in plain English.,"I bought the book on the recommendation of my brother and boy am I glad I did! I always wished I could read all the commentaries surrounding the basic text in the Bible, but my Hebrew isn't up to it and my Aramaic is non existant. This book has solved my problem. It is fascinating and deepens the reader's understanding of Exodus."
5,Perfect Commentary for Beginners,"This is by far my favorite Torah commentary yet! It includes the original Hebrew text and two English translations, which are useful for understanding words with multiple meanings. The commentaries are excellent. While they are edited to exclude most of the notes on the grammatical structure of the text, they provide incredible depth to the meaning of the text and fill in a great deal of background from midrash. This is the text I use when I teach a Torah study class for adults."
5,JPS Miqra'ot Gedolot [Exodus],This commentary offers the torah in 2 versions of English and in Herbrew. The various commentaries offer insights that helped me understand that each person reading Torah will have their own personal interpretation. I hope to obtain all the Torah in the Miqra'ot Gedolot works.
1,A strong message,"I found the book quite disturbing. The author obviously has a social agenda and although many of the reviews mention the wonderfully liberating 'realistic' parents, I know no parents who even slightly resemble Kate's folks. Also, some of the copy used is questionable. ""Good Intentions?"" and some dogs being ""Nightmares?"" There is a lit match on the mom's t-shirt that resembles a cigarette or joint. This compliments the tattoo and nose piercing nicely. My 3 year old won't be reading this one."
5,Phillip Baby Monitor,"5 Stars and worth the cost. Crystal clear quality. You do not even know that it is on because it does not produce any backgound noise. We purchased a Fisher Price model that was inexpensive and it picked-up all kinds of interference from portable phones, the neighbors baby monitor, low frequency radio stations, and more. We thought all monitors were the same. This product is far superior and worth the money! New Mom with a 6 month old who doesn't sleep thru the night. LW"
4,Works MOSTLY great...,"At first blush, I thought this product didn't work that great because it would sound like the audio would ""cut out."" But upon listening to it closer, it actually filters out standard background noise (like a window air-conditioner cycling on and off) so that you don't hear that type of noise, and then actually turns on when the baby makes a noise!I didn't give it 5 stars though, because the thermometer doesn't seem to work very well - it typically shows the temperature at 5-8 degrees above actual room temperature."
2,Not worth the high price,"I bought this monitor to replace theFisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Monitor with Dual Receiver. Loved the features, especially the room temperature thermometer and the two-way radio. The biggest issue with this monitor is that the volume is extremely low. I can't hear my baby at all! The main feature I look for in a baby monitor is the ability to hear what's going on in my baby's room. With the Fisher Price monitor I can even hear my baby's breath.Additionally, the battery life of the Phillips SCD 589 Digital baby Monitor is very poor. Even though the instructions say that you should fully charge the receiver and let the battery wear down during the first three uses, the battery still doesn't last long enough.I wouldn't recommend paying the high price for this product, especially if you live in an area with a lot of noise coming from the street or the environment."
4,Best monitor we've had,"We've had 3 children and about 5 monitors. We first bought a horrible monitor that isn't worth mentioning. For the past several years, we found Sony to make the best, but their monitors keep getting more static-y as they grow older. When we needed to replace yet another Sony, I went for this one. On the plus side, no interference, 3x range of other higher-end monitors I've had, uses rechargeable batteries that are standard (size AA), actually small and light enough to wear like a pager, kind of like having the ability to see temperature in nursery (we live in large house and are far from nursery at night). On the minus side, batteries don't seem to last as long on a charge as other monitors I've had. Overall, it is expensive, but if it lasts it should be worth it (only had it a few months so far)."
2,Poor battery performance,"I followed exactly what the manual told on Battery charging but like most of us, got a very poor performance for battery even when unit just turns on less than 25% of time.Other than the fact I have to carry the power cord around, it is really a good monitor on features, etc."
1,Don't buy this monitor,"At first we loved this baby monitor. The sensitivitly was great, the parental monitor size small and easy to carry around, and there was no interference. Then we started having problems with the charger bases. They didn't charge on contact. We'd have to wiggle it to get the red charger light to go on. It was hit or miss. Then one of the parental units died. We opened the unit and found the batteries had melted. I read on these reviews that you're only supposed to use rechargeable batteries. Either we're idiots or it it wasn't clear that the units could'nt sustain regular batteries. But even when they had the rechargeable batteries in them one unit had no off the charger life. And even if we had used reusable batteries both base connections stopped working. For $200 we should all expect more."
1,Failed,"The product is expensive, however it is not reliable. After 3 years digital monitor failed. It is not anymore possible to read temperature."
3,"Great features, terrible battery life","Our daughter is now over 9 months old so we have used this for a bit. We love the features on this (2 way walkie talkie, temperature reading and temperature alarms if gets too cold or hot). That said, the battery life is TERRIBLE and has gotten worse. Unless you can keep the parent unit in its charger count on very little time available and be VERY CAUTIOUS as after the warning beeps of low battery life, it just turns off. It seems the warnings are far fewer lately.For the price, I would search some more or just spend even more to get bettery battery life with the features OR just get a good unit without the features and a seperate temperature notification system.** Wish I had given it 2 stars instead of 3 but can not change it **"
5,Reliable and easy to use,"This monitor seems to have it all - and then some. The parent unit is portable, and I like the volume and sensitivity settings. We've used the temperature gauge often to verify that our baby's bedroom is a comfortable (and safe) temperature for sleeping.Some of the additional features have so far been useless to us - the ability to turn on the glow light in the child's room, and the ability to play a lullabye remotely... though they're neat ideas they never really come into play.Still, it's a reliable unit, easy to use, highly portable, and I'd recommend it to anybody."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"This monitor has some of the coolest features that could EVER be on a baby monitor. . .telling you the temp in your baby's room, 2 way, being able to control sound and music from your unit to your baby's unit, etc. BUT IF YOU CANT HEAR WHAT YOUR BABY IS DOING, HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO CONTROL?? The parent unit, no matter what you change, is so quiet that you can BARELY hear your child. That made this baby monitor not worth the money, fix that one problem, and it would be worth every penny!"
2,Not worth the money,"Let me start by saying I have never owned another monitor so the interferance issue that people have with other brands I have never experienced. And this monitor works GREAT for that. I have none at all, however, the monitor would not stay charged in my first one. I changed batteries and that did not fix the problem. I might have gotten 2 hours out of it, maybe. It rarely came off the charger with a full charge. So Phillips replaced the whole thing, I do have to say I had no problems with them just sending me a new one. However this one will not tell the right temp. at all. it was broken from the day we got it. now for two hundred dollars I do have to say I would think everything would work and that is not the case. I guess if you want to spend two hundred for no interferance than this is worth it."
3,No major complaints.,"This is the only one I've tried. There is NO interference. I've got computers, cell phones, all my home phones are portable. No interference. It needs some work on volume though. But it does have a volume light that goes off as the noise is occurring. I like it. Won't send it back, but it does need to be a bit louder."
3,not loud enough,We bought this item because of all the great reviews. The good news is that it eliminates all the white noise and static that we hated. I also love the two way walkie talkie feature. The bad news is that it reduces the volume so I can't hear my two year old daughter when she calls me after waking up from her nap. We have the volume control and sensitivity set on maximum. I would not be confident using this for a new born.
1,Defective Product,Ordered the first one. Cradle did not charge. Returned. Ordered replacement. Cradle did not charge again. Returned and Ordered a third one. Amazon won't send me a third one because they think there most be a wider manufacturing problem. I see they are still selling it though. Other reviewers report similar problems with charging.
1,craddle did not charge,bought - returned bought - returnedboth units had craddles that did not charge unit.
4,"What, you call this scary music?","I'm familiar with most of the pieces found in this CD, and I can say I don't think they are frightening at all. They're great and highly enjoyable in their own right (the 'Danse Macabre' by Camille Saint-Saens is lovely dance music), but if one's intention is to bring together a collection of pieces of truly scary classical music, then this anthology hasn't done the job.Here's a list of what I would consider TRULY TERRIFYING works of classical music:~Ralph Vaughan Williams' 4th & 6th symphonies (especially the 2nd movement of each of them)~Igor Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring'~Gyorgy Ligeti's 'Atmospheres' and 'Lux Aeterna' (used in the film '2001')~Almost anything by Bela Bartok (but especially his 'The Miraculous Mandarin')If you want to be truly frightened, go for the said pieces!"
3,"Music Is Very Good, However.........","The music on this CD is all very good, but as I play it, I don't really feel that ""Bump in the Night"" sensation throughout. Since it appears to be marketed for fun Halloween gatherings, I cannot honestly say that it will jumpstart the mood for the average party-goer. While ""Funeral March For a Marionette"" is extremely creepy and sets the mood (for those of you baby-boomers who don't recognize the title---this was the theme music to the ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" TV series), other tunes kind of pull the plug on the momentum. Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" might ring Seasonal for classical music buffs, but I think your everyday Joe will picture helicopters soaring over Vietnam and the cry ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning!""FOUR STARS if you just want a nice sampling of bold classical music, and TWO STARS if you want it to go ""Bump!"" in the Night."
4,Bump in the night,I really enjoy this collection of macabre classical songs. I owned this CD years ago but lost it in a move. I wanted to share it with my family so bought it again.
3,Hooker will be missed.,"John will surely be missed,I have several of his albums and treasure them all.He was the true definition of get down and dirty blue's...His style Is the gold standard Inblue's.He sang with such feeling... that you could visualizethe lyrics....and where they were coming from.John Lee Hooker deserves a front row seat In the musical history books. Sitting next to Robert Johnson who would be proud to have him there.They are national treasures."
3,Maps,World map is a good use for my son's who are curious about locations in the world that they hear about wether from TV or friends. They ask me where that place is and I am able to show them using the map...
4,Mostly ideal for baking cookies,"When baking cookies make sure your baking sheet doesn't have high raised edges as this prevents an even flow of heat. Better yet, buy a baking mat.I have to say though that Calphalon delivers and a silver-colored sheet covered with parchment is the best to keep your cookies from browning too quickly."
2,Shows promise but sputters a bit,"The story premise shows promise. This needed more editing. The plotline gets blurred, the story is like an engine that skips and stalls. I like the world she has created. She did some interesting things, and it kept me interested enough to finish but there are places in it that just leave the reader to make some leaps of logic and fill in the blanks a bit too much."
3,School Days,Ore has written a gritty and all-too-plausible novel of the education system and its lasting impressions on a young mind. OUTLAW SCHOOL is original and filled with dark comedy. This novel doesn't start in the not-too-distant future; it starts with the first period bell tomorrow! Gary S. Potter Author/Poet.
2,A Boring Book that Barely Qualifies as Science Fiction,"Outlaw School is like a boring, badly executed version of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. There is zero depth to the vaguely technical aspects of the story. The entire story is disjointed, and there is an overwhelming lack of a plot.The only truly spectacular thing about this book is that it ends."
1,Cheaply Manufactured Peep,This peep sight is manufactured from cheaply molded plastic with sharp edges and burrs. Installing this peep site could potentially damage the bow string. The provided picture is not the same as the actual sight.
4,smooth transaction,"fast shipping, smooth transaction, just that there are finger prints at the back of watch. Not sure if it's an refurbished one."
4,Landscape Architect,"This book is a good intro to the ""why"" of ecological design. It gives its informatiion in a non-technical way and explains the reasons we should approch design this way. I recommend it for all those involved with land and building design and development."
3,"It's my own fault for not heeding ""starter:""","This is a starter pan set for kittens not adult cat use. I wanted a smaller pan for my elderly car for night time use in my bedroom. Unfortunately he is as big the pan, so I'll use it as a drain pan for small starter plants. The scoop and feeding bowl is also made for kitten use or a small dog. I will donate those to the SPCA."
1,Item fell apart,The brush completely feel apart prior to using it. I sent a review to the company with no response. The wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing. If I would have had some response from the company offering some recourse I would not have been this dissatisfied.
5,Great Anti-Gambling Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great anti-gambling movie starring Shirley Jones.It's a must see!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,good,strong not flimsy. Double visor not good as it makes it thick and you feel that there is something hanging in front of your head
3,A little disappointing,"Like other reviewers, I bought this without actually looking at it and I agree that it could have been done much better. It's a very good idea which seems to have fallen down in the execution. To the list of serious omissions I would add: The Ice Storm, The Godfather (!!) Rosemary's Baby, Midnight Cowboy, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Primary Colours, Lady In The Lake, Fear & and Loathing in Las Vegas (if we are talking about Hollywood here.) National cinemas other than American are very poorly represented. The book does acknowledge that it's the 'abridged' edition, and I would not have liked to have to choose what went in and what got left out, but still. The individual essays vary a great deal in usefulness and quality, with some being really very good and others abysmal. In future editions I would like to see more attention given to non-US filmmaking."
3,Film Primer,"It is interesting if you like to read. It is also interesting to see how what were once thought as interesting and new stories are old, recycled from novels that few knew existed."
4,Cambodian poetry in the spirit of Whitman,"This is a stunning collection of poetry presented in a bi-lingual layout that provides an extremely moving and spiritual diary of a poet that witness and survived the savagery of the Pol Pot years. What is more interesting is that the author U Sam Oeur has stretched the traditional and very formal structure of Khmer poetry and brought his own love and admiration of Walt Whitman to create a new kind of Cambodian poetry. I had the fortune of attending a reading by U Sam. His translator, Ken McCullough read the english translation which was followed by the author's sung and chanted rendition of the poem in Khmer. The author told us that when his family was finally able to return to their home in Phnom Penh, while everything else had remained, his entire library of some 2,000 books had been removed and apparently destroyed. The only thing that he discovered from his collection was a single page from a book of poems by Emily Dickinson."
4,a crusade of stuff,"It was absolutely fabulous to find a Babylon 5 CRUSADE book! Without even thinking my fingers did the point click and buy! 4 dayslater I ripped open my box...my excitement now waivering. Before me was a 34 page booklet that resembled those flimsy typed high school or graduation programs. The ( ) was a bit too steep for this. However, the content is pretty great. With listings of websites with info,conventions,merchandise,and facts galore, my exitement level arose!And I loved the episode guide at the end of the book. This booklet is great for info, but the ( ) may be pricey for being a flimsy booklet. END"
4,older book,a very good copy of a previously published older work by this great author. it arrived fast to my home and appears barely opened. packaged well too. appreciate the service!!
3,HEAVY---but very functional,"If I had it to do over, I'd have paid a lot more attention to the weigh of the item...especially when its something carried often...daily."
4,Huge but functional,"Well, I kind of did this to myself by purchasing an enormous computer, but this is an ENORMOUS bag. When I'm on the subway or walking down the street I'm always afraid that I'm going to knock someone over with it. It is more similar to luggage than to a tote bag. That said, there's room for my giant computer plus various other sundries. The cell phone pocket is well - placed and easy to get to."
1,NOT A BOX SET,"This is not a box set. The first season is a box set, the 2nd,3rd, and final season are individual dvds put together with the first season. I don't know if they came that way or put together like that. But I don't consider that a box set. It makes me feel like I got ripped off. I could've bought them individually myself if that's what I wanted. This seems like aSoul Food: The Complete Seriescase of dishonest advertising. I just want to let other customers know what their getting so they can decide if they want to get it like that."
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"Boxed video set states that the episodes are edited versions of the original series. Booooooo! After reading the disclaimer, I will still keep it. In this day-and-age of unsensored videos, shame on the manufacturer."
5,Had to have it,"I bought the first season when I was in OIF 1 in 2003, when I deployed this time I figured why not get all five seasons."
5,Soul Food Complete Series,+++ Produc received earlier than expected - great !--- I had to pay custom fees which I do not find normal (20 !!!)
1,Review,Iam certainly not pleased with this purchase- it is useless and have not been really able to use itBill Dwyer
1,sub-par quality shirts,"I ordered 2 of these shirts for $10 each. The material is very flimsy and, out of the dryer, the shirts are stretched out in spots. After only 2 washes, they are almost too short to wear anymore. Save your money, or go for the Micropima Arnie shirts - much better quality"
2,Be careful on the size selection,"These shirts are so hugh I can swim in it. I normally wear Large polo shirts and ordered 2 large ones as well as 2 medium ones for my dad. The large ones are way way too large, at least 2 size over what you would typically find in a clothing store. Even the medium size is bit large for me, but I end up keeping it. Amazon refunded me $3.50 a shirt after taking off for the postages.The quality of the cloth is good, very airy and would serve well as a golf shirt. Just make sure to select 1 or 2 sizes smaller than your typical size."
3,Priced about right,"These shirts are of okay quality--thin material that shrinks to the correct size. Priced about right. Inside seams are finished a little roughly though they are not visible on the outside. Buy a couple of these to work around the house in, wear to the grocery store, but not to the office."
5,Finally Some Solid Advice,"This is an awesome book packed with solid truths for LASTING weight loss and wellness. This book inspired me!! It is refreshing to see an author give the ""ugly"" truth about the fads of our day. I would encourage all who want some no nonsense, solid nutritional/fitness advice to buy this book!"
1,Too darn small!,"I was expecting larger pieces since my search was for ""large building blocks"" what I received were blockes that my two year old grandson wouldn't play with and he LOVES to stack anything!"
2,Not at all needed.....,I guess I should blame myself for this but.... This video was a waste of money. All it really does is read you the owners manual. Not at all what I expected. I actually thought it was more of lessons in how it works and how to really use it. It's more of a video that just shows you what the buttons do. SO... I would not purchase this video if I were you. I would simply read the manual. It's much better than this...
5,Great Cookie Sheet,"While I was reluctant to spend this much money on a cookie sheet, I'm really glad that I did. This is the best cookie sheet I've ever owned. I purchased two of the large sheets and now need the medium sized sheet for the extra overflow of cookies. They bake well and actually look like the cookies in the recipe's pictures. Great purchase~"
2,"Really, Really Hard!","I LOVE Bethenny but this DVD is NOT at all for Beginners! The moves are Really hard! I do like the Bonus workouts at the end and hope that maybe someday I can do this workout, but I will have to order a Beginners Yoga DVD first!"
2,Not for me..,I got this at a very low price or I would have been very upset. She talks way TOO much..she is annoying..I agree with the other reviewer about the annoyance of her interrupting the yoga instructor. It is hard to quiet the mind and concentrate on your pose with her yammering on and on and on. I would return this dvd if I could. The weight section was the only valuable piece on here and I wouldn't do it every day. Try shapely girl cardio with weights..much better workout with less chattering...
4,Great Workout!,"I absolutely love Bethenny, her show, and her books! - so I was excited when she came out with a fitness dvd. I have to admit, this workout is not easy! I have been active all my life and have done some yoga before (only beginners though!) and I was really surprised at how challenging this was for me! I definitely broke a sweat and had to take a few breaks throughout the workout. I am saying all of this as a good thing though, because I know that it's working. I would recommend this dvd to anyone who is interested in yoga and wants something to help keep them active! However, be prepared for a tough one!"
2,kinda boring,i did the excersize once and that was enough it felt very looong but yet all the moves were rushed it didnt give you enough time to even get one position right yoga is supposed to be for relaxation this felt overly rushed and did nothing for me at all. it was also confusing both bethenny and the trainer were doing different moves sat the same time i didnt know who to follow. yeah it was disapointing.
3,Somewhat dissappointed,"I was so excited to receive the dvd based on ratings, however I was somewhat dissappointed.For someone who exercises regularly it was a bit of a let down. 40 minutes of yoga is not really enough to feel the burn. Movements are not held long enough. Although their descriptions and movements were great and very helpful it never seemed to get me to the point I was hoping to reach. I have yet to do the butt portion. Arms were okay, could of used one more set of everything. If you are not a serious exerciser this would probably be fine, and maybe somewhat difficult, for those who are I would not recommend this video."
1,Not for beginners,"I bought this because in her hype and promos Bethenny said that it was for ""all levels of fitness"". I am not in stellar shape but I do work out and I got frustrated after the first 3 minutes! If you look like the women in the video and are very flexible, you may like it but it was not for me."
2,NOT for beginners!,I was very excited to get this video but disappointed half way through. Not only is this video clearly not for beginners but the quality wasn't very good and the background music was horrible.The moves were much too fast with very little instruction. Very disappointed with this product.
5,Love Body By Bethenny,"I received this DVD for Mother's Day (it was on my wish list). It is great. I have taken yoga classes before and wanted to again. However, I wanted to make sure that I still remembered the positions. This is my third day of doing the yoga moves with Bethenny and it is great. My daughter came over this morning and we both exercised to the DVD. She is now going to buy one. Guess I won't be paying $10. for each yoga class, I will just continue to work out with Bethenny's DVD. People it is well worth the money and I would recommend it to all of you.Congrats Bethenny and Jason are your beautiful baby girl."
5,Great video,This is a fun work out. It is hard at first but it is getting easier! I have doing this for several weeks now and look foward to it.
5,"love it, long and lean","I've been doing yoga on and off (mostly off) for a few years and am a beginner. While I love the in-person classes, my pocketbook doesn't feel the same, so I've turned to DVDs. I tried a few rentals and couldn't see myself doing them all the time. Bethenny's DVD wasn't my first or even fifth choice, I like her, but thought, ""what does she know about yoga?""Still looking for a routine that wouldn't feel routine--- I gave this DVD a try--why not?The yoga portion is a great workout! short and sweet that will give you a long and lean body -- the woman that leads the practice is a goddess and a fantastic teacher that really explains the poses to you and what you're doing -- and I loved that Bethenny wasn't ""perfect"" -- she was real, and had her struggles during the video. She could have talked less, but then again, that's Bethenny!I haven't done the weights portion, but it seemed straight-forward and pretty painless when I scanned through it."
4,Not a Stress Relieving DVD,"I am a huge fan of Bethenny Frankel and find her quite funny and entertaining in this video, the yoga is really good and I like the practice here, but it's not a quiet, relaxing yoga practice. When I'm in the need of something fun, light and I am not in the really need to relax mood, this is not the dvd. I have others that relieve the stress and relax me. If I just want a yoga workout, Bethenny's is great and funny to boot."
2,not impressed,"If people kept asking Bethenny what she did to keep in shape, all she needed to do was say ""yoga"", she didn't need to release her own very mediocre yoga dvd. The yoga routine is nothing special, and probably too challenging for a beginner, her commentary is at best distracting, and at worst annoying. There are better, more engaging yoga dvd's out there."
4,Sweating in first 5 minutes!,"I just purchased this DVD and it has not come yet, but I have already started using the Video on Demand feature and set up my computer so I could do this workout this morning. I have never done yoga before, but am familiar with some of the poses (my sister does yoga). I found the workout to be challenging -- I am not super flexible, but I tried everything and eventually got better! It may just be that my apartment was hot this morning, but I found myself sweating by the end of the workout. I know I was getting a good workout, even though it seems like all you are doing is stretching into difficult positions. I will update my review once I get the actual DVD and try it for a couple weeks, but so far so good! Thanks Bethenny!"
4,Perfect for those who don't like all the zen,I found this video challenging yet fun. I like how Bethenny says the things you are thinking during your typical yoga session. Not too serious and not too zen. Just a good workout.
2,Folded Corners,"This is a very nice pan, but it is extemely difficult to clean. The corners are folded over and water gets trapped in them and then will rust if you cannot get it out. I have become very frustrated with baking sheets/pans that rust due to trapped water. I am hand washing these items as well, so I would reccomend looking for something without folded corners."
3,"Good pan, but cleaning is a pain","This is a heavy pan and bakes well in the oven. But when it comes to cleaning up time, this pan is a pain. The corners are very hard to get to."
2,nice pan till you have to clean it,"The pan is terrific - heavy duty, nice non-stick surface, but SO difficult to clean. And what's worse, I was having trouble cleaning the corners and assumed it was dishwasher-safe. Big mistake: the non-stick coating is gone and it's no longer usable unless I line the whole thing with foil. Ugh."
1,Do Not Buy This Switch,Like all the others this switch does not work. Just dead after installation. Worthless. I purchased it on clearance for $5.00 at the hardware store. Hmmm why is it on clearance.
1,Stay Away,I purchased 3 of these 6 months ago and all 3 are dead now. Doesn't even warrant 1 star but that's the lowest I can go here :-(
5,Read it and laugh!,"as I couldn't stop doing at the typically boyish descriptions of the misadventures of the Time Warp Trio in this little volume. The jokes may be juvenile, but they're not too juvenile for middle-aged me, and I was perfectly willing to read the whole book to my children for the sake of their (completely satisfactory) reaction to a joke about cooked meat."
4,Laugh out loud fun!,"The Time Warp Trio (Fred, Sam and Joe) find heart-stoppingadventure when they end up in the days of the caveman. Cleverword-play keeps the reader laughing and the non-stop adventure keeps the pages turning. Another fun and highly entertaining book in the Time Warp Trio series. Jon Scieszka combines adventure, history, fantasy and humor in a compelling format that even reluctant readers will find hard to put down."
5,My Review of Your Mother was a Neanderthal,"I think this book should be rated 5 stars because it's really funny and has a lot of smart remarks. In the story Sam Joe and Fred, in other words the time warp trio travel to the time 40,000 BC. There they meet cavemen and cave women. The problem is that they have to find the magic book to get back to their own time. There they met three cavegirls who took them up to meet their leader Ma. Then Ma locked them up a cave and that's when thier problems started. But they finally escaped by running away when Ma opened the gate. After awhile they met cavemen and their leader Ug. Then Ug showed them maggot infested meat. When Sam Joe and Fred tried to get out of the smelly hole in the ground Ug pulled them down and said no caw. That's when they saw a sabre tooth tiger and they came up with an idea. They dressed like a really ugly monster and scared the tiger off. Then they went back to the cave and found the book. They used the book to go back home.By Kayla Overman"
3,"Review For ""Your Mother Was A Neanderthal"" Book","This book is about 3 young boys go back in time all the way to the stoneage. Itmay seem like a fun adventure to the time warp trio, but they run into a lot of trouble along the way including a tribe of hostile cavewomen, a saber-toothed tiger, a bone rattling earthquake, and a wooley mammoth who wants to crush them. But the biggest problem is they depend on ""The Book"" to get them back from their little adventures but how can they get back home when writing has'nt been invented yet? Find out what happens to the time warp trio by reading this book that has comedy, adventure, and magic."
5,Spooktacular Fun,Great collection of new Halloween fun. New party songs and dance to the Mambo! Kids love it! So did my In-laws!
3,"Decent performance, great price","I bought these largely on the price. $... is less than half what the Sonys were and a sixth of the Bose. At the time it was a very small market. The performance was good, I used the phone daily in the New York City Subway and on many flights and they worked well. They do not isolate your ears (they sit on the ear rather than surrounding them) and this is a fundamental flaw as they essentially don't dampen sound that is directly in front or behind, but they did a decent job. After about a year of daily use they did finally die, but I think I got my money's worth."
5,A Godsend,"Love these! They work best with music or other audio source, rather than by themselves because they cancel the low dronong noise of the airplane but leave annoying human voices and other sounds as is. When paired with the inflight audio or an MP3 player (I use the Intel Audio Player 3000), the sound is clear and the drone of the plane is greatly reduced. They come with converters for use on planes, but I haven't had to use them since most planes have a standard jack in the armrest these days. Also comes with a carrying bag, which is fine. They fold up pretty small and are a good size for a laptop bag, etc. The only downside is that the earpieces aren't form fitted to the ear, and after about 3 hours of use the rims of my ears get sore. But you get used to it and it's better than the alternative for the price. $50 is hard to beat! I would definitely buy them again."
1,Refurbished -- but still defective,"I bought a refurbished pair for $ from an Amazon partner, ""..."". They came in some generic packaging with photocopied instructions and a 30 day non-manufacturer warrantee. Evidently there's now a mini-industry of businesses that handle returns and refurbishes them.At home they seemed to work. With noise reduction on they had a soft background hiss, and if I moved around in some noise settings they produced an annoying buzz. On an airplane, however, the right earphone produced an earsplitting whine. The headphones are defective, the noise canceling mechanism is malfunctioning.I have a nasty suspicion that the headphones were rather minimally ""refurbished"", and that this defect was the reason they were returned in the first place. It wouldn't show up in simple testing without an airplane volume noise source nearby.Don't buy these refurbished headphones unless you have money to waste...."
1,What a joke,"I rarely am so displeased with a product that I'll go out of my way to write a negative review of it. In this case I'm that displeased. The noise canceling technology of these headphones consist of ""white noise"" generated in the headphone speakers, intended to drown out other sounds. Great idea, but if I want to listed to the hiss of white noise I'll hold a seashell up to my ear and tell myself I can hear the ocean. Replacing one type of noise with another is not helpful."
1,"medieval torture device cutting into your scalp, sums it up!","I wish I would have read the reviews. I have tried foam, pillows like another reviewer and a clean diaper and still too painful to wear! I can't believe how uncomfortable these things are!"
2,They hurt -- and they buzz!,"I wish I had checked the Amazon customer reviews before I purchased these Aiwa noise canceling headphones.The tension in the headband was too high, so they hurt my ears when I wore them. More importantly, they tended to buzz (electronically) when I used them with my laptops -- totally defeating any noise canceling benefit they might've provided.I was looking for a less expensive alternative to my Sennheiser HDC 451's, which are excellent.I guess I should've known better."
1,Bad out of box,This set of headphones were bad right out of the box..I have co-worker/friends that have purchased the same product ( refurbished by the same company ) and most have failed to work properly within 2 to 5 days..problems like ( canceling feature doesn't work at all..Humming noise..or bad sound quality ) I wouldn't waste my time or money sending product back to this company..as they can't fix them right the first time..(...)..
2,Great until they get broken,"I had really been enjoying them and taking them on my business trip flights all the time until they got broken.I think that this model has a design flaw, and the plastic piece(s), which go over your head, cannot hold the tension over time. It looks that, due to the folding design, the tension does not get distributed well to the loop (constructed with two plastic pieces instead of one), and they eventually get broken off. One side of my set got completely broken off, and another side has cracks. I do not particularly have a small head, but.......I had been recommending the set to other people, but not anymore."
1,Avoid these headphones,"I've had these headphones for about a year. And they are truly awful.They sound terrible. They buzz when noice canceling is turned on. They are very uncomfortable. And they don't work very well at cancelling the equipment noise in my cubicle.A coworker who tried them jokingly suggested that the buzz was the ""noise canceling"" feature, because he couldn't here the equipment fan noise in his office/lab because the buzz masked it. My experience is the buzz just adds to the noise.I've tried to give the headphones away twice. Both times my coworkers have returned them. I'd recommend that you seriously look at other noise canceling headphones."
1,Astonishingly uncomfortable.,"The headband looks like it should sit flat on your head, but it doesn't. You have to move the headphones around a little to get the noise cancelling to kick in, and the sharp plastic edge of the band digs into your scalp like a slow medieval torture (yes, I have hair, it doesn't help). I have been seen sitting on planes with part of an airplane pillow on my head, just trying to make these livable for an hour. The low price and somewhat-functional noise cancelling are useless if you can't wear them. Order something else, I am."
4,great buy for the price,"This is definitely a good buy - I think ""noise canceling"" = ""amplified"" more than anything else. The little monitor microphones work, but the headphones were just as good with the power ""off"" than with the power ""on"" (other than being a little quieter w/o the amplification). If you want the best, go with the Bose QuietComfort headphones (free trial for 30 days, too)..."
3,"good sound, but too big","These are good, solid headphones, however:I dont understand the reviewer who said that they were ""tight"". He must have a basketball for a head. I have a big head - if I ever buy a hat, I always buy the biggest one in the store. When I wear these headphones, they are loose on me. If I tilt my head, they fall off. Check out the picture - see the top band? You can't make it bigger or smaller. Only the side bands are adjustable. I used these every day on the train, and I got a neck ache from them - I inadvertantly tightened my neck muscles in an attempt to keep my head straight so the headphones would stay on. I had to stop using them.In addition to this, when you wear them, you have hard plastic sitting on top of your head. Tolerable, but not very comfortable.So my ""3"" rating is a ""5"" for electronics and overall quality, and a ""1"" for comfort and ergonomics. I'm shopping around for something better, and this time maybe I'll try them on before I buy them."
3,The finest in audio discomfort,"I've been a fan of Aiwa since I worked at an electronics store in High School. I'd tell people that Aiwa was pretty much the same as Sony but cheaper. That still holds true -- a co-worker of mine has the exact same headphones with the Sony label and they cost him exactly twice as much. So these are a good value.Unfortunately, they're painful to use. I simply love the idea of having a battery strapped to my head but couldn't they at least put it on the outside of the band? The compartment juts out on the inside, as you can see in the picture. The padding on the ear pieces is also quite thin and doesn't provide much comfort.I won't comment on the audio quality since I haven't had the opportunity to use them on a plane yet. It doesn't cancel out the background noise of my co-workers but it probably would if they started talking at a lower frequency. I'll try to get them to do that."
3,very good,I am a classical musician. I am very picky when it comes to sound. These are good ear phones. My only complaint is it doesn't handle really low tones and they are not loud enough.
1,think twice,"Think more than twice before you decide to buy this product, unless the shape of your head is square.I wonder if the design engineer of this product knew the word ""ergonoimcs"". Your head and ears will start hurting right after you use the headphone.Don't buy this product. Buy anything else(Brookstone or Koss).I really with I had seen this kind of advice before I made a fatal mistake."
3,Cute color...fitting was a challenge,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. We have had other speedo googles before so I figured they would work out great. They were just okay. A little difficult to adjust (she has wide bridge nose) and she kept complaining that they were ""too tight"". We finally did get them adjusted right, but it wasn't as easy as some of our other speedo googles."
4,Great adjuster on strap but single strap is a disadvantage,"These goggles are really nice in that the strap adjusts from the back, so you can adjust it after it is on, and loosen it to remove the goggles. I think this would be an advantage for long haired kids. However, the single strap is not as secure as the double strap on the Speedo hydrospex, which are our favorite."
5,Great toy!,My daughter loves all the big cats so this was a great addition to her selection. Schleich figures are my favorite for detail and size but safari did a great job on this one.
3,Not to the typical standard of other Safari or Schleich,"We collect a lot of Safari and Schleich animals. Since Schleich did not have a panther decided to go with the Safari one. Was disappointed with this one as the eyes/face did not look realistic. This is very unlike a Safari product where one would expect great detail. Wish Schleich makes a panther.having said that, it is very durable and a good size to play with."
1,bad art,its poorly done cg with cell shading for texture work wii games don't even look this bad the lip sync is off animations are bad the original anime version makes this version look so bad even the into music is bad this is just one to skip.
1,very disapointing,I preordered this movie months ago and had been literally counting down the days until it would arrive at my door step only to become very disappointed. I'm a huge fan of berserk and have been since I discovered it years ago in fact I would even say its my favorite anime of all time. The animation was good until the cgi would kick in mainly around battle scenes where I kept getting reminded of the lego video game graphics and people. The movie was hard to follow even for someone who had seen the original anime series many times and if you had never heard or watched berserks anime then forget about understanding this movie. Instead ofcomming out with these disappointing movies why couldn't they have just picked up the anime where it left off and keep it the original animation? This movie was an embarrassment to the berserk franchise and an insult to its fans don't buy it. Instead just rewatch the anime or read the wonderful manta and remember the good times.
5,simply the best,Won't find many like this. I can't wait for the next one. Keep them coming! Die hard fans won't be disappointed!
3,Good anime but only for those familiar with Berserk,"The updated animation is wonderful and I like that the original voice actors came back because they were spectacular. However, I don't think a completely new viewer who hasn't watched the original berserk anime or has read the actual Berserk manga would be impressed by the story and how it seems to jump to one major event to the other without much explanation or set up.If you love Berserk like, you have to watch it just to see the updated animation which is right up there with the best of them but it provides nothing really new, in fact, you are losing a lot of the story because they are giving us 70 minutes of an anime show that had 25 24 minute episodes."
5,i love it,finely its her if u are fan of the original you will love this one i can't w for the second one to come out
4,love anime,this was very good film and liked the style in which it was made. well thank you and have a good day
2,"Great Story, 3D is Awful.","I'll start out with the fact that I am a big fan of the manga. That being said, this is a great version of the story.Technically however, there are parts of this that are near unwatchable.While the traditional animation is amazing, the use of 3D models is awful. Holy crap they are bad. There are whole sections that look and feel like a PS2 videogame cutscene.I am very glad I did not purchase this, and only rented the HD version.From the title and intro, it looks like they are going to make more of these. Please god no more 3D. Just animate the thing."
1,Berserk done wrong,"I am going to start by saying Berserk the series is my second favorite anime of all time, but this Golden Arc story has reduced it to Naruto mindless action that should not even carry the same name. All the character development is gone our of Guts, Caska, and especially Corkus who has none of the personality from the original anime. The story is rushed, and the battles have no build up of suspense to make it feel any different than any other anime on the market. If you like action then you will initially like the animated battles, but even those get tiresome as the movie dramatized flare takes away from the struggle it is supposed to represent. The worst part of this anime is the dialogue, once one of the best written animes I am watch, has been reduced to a childish dribble that makes it feel like an episode of Pokemon. I am glad my friend bought this instead of myself, because it is money wasted, get the original series and watch this movie series free on the internet."
2,Ohhh Yea.... Wait what? NO! NO! NO!,"This movie is an hour and a half covering about 4 1/2 hours of anime, its just not enough time to tell this story in the right way. For me the best part of berserk is not the action, it is the story and characters. The anime took its time in setting up the characters, making you experience the story from there perspective. When someone in the story is betrayed or hurt emotionally you feel the same way, but in this movie I really don't think its enough time, you just don't give a $***.Just my two cents though, you might love this adaptation, then again you might watch all the marvel movies in awe. Oh how the entertainment industry is in favor of the idiot."
2,manga> 1st anime> this,"This is actually worse than the first anime. I thought it would be a rush job but with really good action scenes.The action scenes kind of sucked even worse than the cell animation from the first anime.It condenses everything up to Griffiths imprisonment into one hour. And the rational thing to do would be say okay we can't really tell any kind of plot someone would understand, but at least we could get one really well done action scene.every single somewhat decent action bit was actually in the preview. I literally liked the preview better than the movie itself.No extras except some stupid concept art. no outtakes, no commentary, no behind the scenes.berserk is one of my favorite manga and I was expecting way more. I got a huuuuuuge disappointment."
2,I now understand why this wasn't released in American theaters.,"Incredibly short and rushed. If you are a true Berserk fan, you should probably watch this, but unless you are super hardcore into it.. just stick to the books."
1,Poor Service,"This product was not shipped until after 9 days from the time i placed the order. I feel that is entirely too long to wait for a product to be shipped. Then it takes 4-5 days after that to receive the product. I would never order from this supplier again. There was not indication of why it took so long to ship. they could have emailed me to say temporarly out of stock etc., but they didn't."
4,Folid Acid Tablets,"This was a very pleasant and easy experience, everything arrived intact and in a extremely timely manner, will definitely reorder from this reseller"
2,A Little Disappointing,"My son received this for his 4th Birthday, and I have to say that I, as he was, was disappointed with this product. The track has to be perfect in order for Thomas to follow it (which it only does about 50% of the time) and don't dare make the turns too sharp, or it gets completely lost. Overall, the train is cute because it does play music, but my 4 year old would rather draw on it then try and make this train follow the track. Too much work, for it to properly work only a fraction of the time.All in all, he would have been just as satisfied with the $16 'on sale at Walmart' regular aqua-doodle mat.This item is too expensive for it to not work as promised."
2,pen broke in two days,"I think this toy is great, my boys love it. Unfortunately the top of the train track pen after a couple of uses wouldn't come off. I tried everything. eventually the pen part cracked, and the whole think=g is useless. I can not seem to find a replacement for just the Track pen. It still works with the straight pen, but it just isn't the same. I am very dissapointed!"
1,Regret buying it.,"This toy wasn't what I expected. The train does it's own thing and doesn't follow the track like it's suppose to. My son loves Thomas the Train, but he is not interested in this at all. He played with it only twice since he got it for Christmas."
2,you can find a better toy,My son received this toy at his birthday. He didn't find it too interesting and is hard to draw the tracks evend for us.I think for this amount of money you can find a better toy.
2,Disappointed,The train doesnt seem to follow the tracks good and it took only 1 day for the train to break.
4,Yes it works,"I bought this for my son almost two years ago. (he was three at the time) He thinks it's great! He's a big fan of trains and thinks it's fun having the train follow his pen mark around.(water pen) He likes the track pen, but has more success making the train go where he wants it to go with the regular water pen, because you have to make the marks with the track pen a little more slowly so the marks will turn out right, (this can be dificult for kids who are very young) but that's not a problem with the regular water pen."
3,not worth the money,"We got this toy for our 3 year old for Christmas. it is great in theory, but the track roller pen does not work with a darn. it wouldn't make the track design on the mat. the train does work on the mat with water, but not that well.It would be worth it if it were only $10-15. But $40 is way too over priced."
2,Train broken out of the box,I bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 and 6 year olds. Out of the box the train was broken. We've had aqua doodle mats before and they are wonderful - but I'd skip the train or other bells and whistles and stick with the original product.
1,AWFUL!! DO NOT PURCHASE!,I purchased this product for my nephew as a Christmas present. When we opened it the left side of the train does not move so the train just spins in circles. This seller was unhelpful in returning and the manufacturer no longer makes this product to send a new one or help with parts to fix. So PLEASE BE ADVISED TO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM AND BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS SELLER!!! AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!!
4,Thomas Toot N Doodle a winner,Would recomend supervision for 3yr olds mine likes to play with the water for the pen and the track maker constantly. Other wise its great fun everyone loves to play with it including us adults. It's great how the train realy follows the tracks to make. The only flaw is its durability my 3yr old son broke the cap of the roller and the pad gets cracked if not careful while folding it away. Overall two thumbs up!
3,Aquadoodle Thomas TND,I don't know why some people are having trouble making Thomas follow the track lines and others are not but I am one of the people who is having difficulty with this toy. It seems that it is unreliable if it works for some and not others so you are taking your chances by buying this toy.I highly recommend buying the mat and markers separately. My 2yr old loves the mat and any marker or stamper she can use on the mat to create designs. She gave up on Thomas and only uses him as a toy. I am disappointed I paid so much money for this toy when I could have spent half the price without the Thomas part of it.
3,I was looking for dinner music,"I place a high priority to the selections made for my dinner party, and although this is still a good CD, it did not meet my expectations to play for dinner guests. I was disappointed. It is marketed as ""Dinner Classics"", but not a good mix in my opinion."
3,Front view better than sides,"I got this bench and put it together. When it was all put together (and yes, I did use glue on the dowels for extra hold), the doors did not stay closed. The reason was that the magnets that were already attached to the inside did not line up with the doors. It wouldn't have mattered if I have reversed the doors; they never would have lined up. So I had to drill the wood to realign the magnets. When that was all done, the front view was better than the sides. You can tell the side panels are veneer and don't look as nice as the front view. Other than that, it seems to be okay - a decent product for the value and energy put into assembly."
2,"Reasonable price, but lacking in basic quality","We bought 5 pieces in this collection and needed to return 3 of them due to manufacture defect. There were scratches on noticable areas and poorly drilled holes which made assembly impossible. For example, this bench comes with magnetic doors for closure- the magnetic strip and metal piece were severely misaligned. We had to remove the magnet and glue it in its proper place to ensure the doors would remain closed. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />I honestly expected more from Target. The price is reasonable, but it's a gamble on if the box you choose will be defective. Then you are left with a headache to return such a cumbersome item. Our luck was not good- 3 out of 5 to be returned is not good odds. Buyer beware or at least forewarned."
5,durable bench,"I realy like this bench. I bought it yesterday and I did not have any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews. It was v.easy and quick to put together. Every one in my house like it. It is durable bench,Fits perfect the place that I have it in. I'll use it to store shoes,toys,misc. I would recommend this bench to anyone."
2,Not worth the money,"I've had good experiences with most furniture pieces from this collection, but this was not one of them. It arrived with one piece damaged; other pieces were warped or not cut straight. It was very difficult to assemble -- DO NOT attempt this by yourself, at least if it is as difficult to fit together as mine. Also, don't buy it if you think someone who weighs more than 200 pounds might sit on it (as per a warning in the package, and judging by the quality of the materials). Also, be careful when screwing in the metal pegs. The metal is soft and the head will strip out easily, as will the anchors that snug them down."
3,The BEST mojito recipe,"I acquired this book for free, and it seems to be very authentic. I haven't made any of the main dishes, because I'm a vegetarian, and Cuban food is not so vegetarian friendly (or Kosher, for that matter -- lots of pork, eggs, cheese and cream). Vegetarians: don't expect to make much more than rich desserts, stellar drinks, and basic who-needs-a-recipe-for-this sides. Meat lovers: Get a copy, it's a good quality cookbook!I'll have to figure out if there is a good way to work around all of the meat without sacrificing authenticity too much.But the mojito recipe in this cookbook is the best I have ever used. We won't drink them at bars and restaurants anymore... it's that much better. I serve ""the best mojito in town"" and it comes from this cookbook.*EDITED FOR CLARITY 6.2011"
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"This angel food cake pan is STEEL construction, not aluminum. Just got my pan, via Amazon, made in China, and yeah it is heavy. Steel is so much heavier than aluminum. Check this out: try a magnet on it. It sticks everywhere. Aluminum is not ferromagnetic.What clued me in? One of my other pans, a ""heavy gauge aluminum construction"" (printed right on the box) Calphalon Commercial 11 x 17 large bake pan is RUSTING. Also made in China. All steel construction.I paid way too much for conventional rust-prone steel."
1,In the pursuit of Spartacus,"Lázlo Seregi, appointed chief choreographer for Hungarian State Opera Ballet in 1974 dreamed a dream of a Spartacus (1968)at least as good as Grigorovich's.He even succeded in having it danced by Australian Ballet(1990)and by its leading male dancer Steven Heathcote whose Des Grieux (1995) would be so beautifully danced!In this case it is really a minor third rate choreography with nothing but sought after brutality in it.Whereas with Grigorovich, the main role acquires depth and soul interacting with the other strong characters, this rather inferior choreography is just a pretext to a mere display of macho men dancing(not to be confused with the virility of the Bolshoi dancers led by Mukhamedov.A disaster."
5,A Few Corrections,"The title of this anointed album is ""Just a Closer Walk""; not the song title of ""Just a Closer Walk with Thee"" as Amazon has titled it. This album is available brand new from the Kenneth Copeland Ministry website. The lyrics are written within the CD booklet so you can sing along if you wish. ""There is a River"" is my favorite song on this album."
1,Falta oficio,La historia no tiene mucho vuelo. La escritura muestra bstantes ripios. La autora necesita un buen editor.
1,battery eater-batteries didn't even last 24hrs,"this ate C batteries like crazy...they didn't even last 24 hrs and they were brand new Duracells. I went through a ton of batteries and the compartment is soooo large you have to try to hide it, bulky/unsightly. Do not recommend these...there is no on/off switch either so you have to take the batteries out to turn it off.don't buy"
2,Ok for basics,This book covers most of the basics but is far from being up to date in technology. The student would be better off looking at the TREC website and reading papers submitted by participants.
4,HP 56/57 C9321BN ink cartridges.,Worked great with my former printer. No problems and they lasted quite some time.I would purchase again.Kevin.
5,These HP cartridges are a bargain!,These were brand-new cartridges. I saved over $15 by buying from this Amazon partner. Even Walmart couldn't beat the price! Every little bit helps in today's economy! Thank you.
4,Works just fine,"I needed a color cartridge since I had somehow messed up the old one. Seeing as how I could save money by purchasing a 2-pack of color and black, of which I would need the latter eventually anyway, I picked up this product. It came sealed well and had the protective tape over the gold strip that contacts the leads of the printer. So far the color has been working just fine. I expect the same of the black. I'd purchase this product again."
5,Moves air when needed,"It's silent most of the time. It has a temp sensor on it by the hub. WHen the air going through it gets too hot....it steps up. It has a mid step which is fairly quiet, and at full tilt....it may be slightly noisier that the other fans in the 2u case. However, I put this at the exhaust of a PSU, so there is nothing in the way to muffle it.Ambient in case temps down about 4-5 degrees...board just 1 or 2..Now using these in both the 60, and 80mm flavors....I believe they hit the sweet spot dba/cfm. Highly recomend."
3,Nice size loaf pan,"This is a nice size and good heavy weight loaf pan. It did a good job on the meat loaf. Would have been fantastic, if I had lowered the temperature and watched the time better. My main complaint is the cleanup. Had to use a toothbrush to clean out the deep creases on the sides and went over it several times before getting all the gunk out. Think I will use these pans just for bread from now on."
5,It's A Loaf Pan Not An Angel Food Cake Pan!,"Great Pan for breads, meatloafs, Tofuloafs (Ick!). Your Product will cook a bit faster than the cheeper loaf pans that are out there. You will need to stay by your oven and check for doneness instead of gabbing on the telephone. Cheeper Loaf pans are not sexy! The reason your product will cook faster is the heavy aluminum commercial quality and construction. They are non- stick, but I still grease and dust the pans the way any recipe would require. Your baked goods will ""Pop"" right out. Easy to clean, just rinse with warm sudsy water. Then go out and buy yourself something PRADA.Note: If you are looking for an Angel Food Cake Pan, then you should buy an Angel Food Cake Pan! These are pans that are specifically designed for Angel Food Cakes. They have a hole in the middle for even heat distribution. Bake Well! :)"
1,Large loaf pan,"I do not feel I can adequately rate this product, inasmuch as there are no dimensions listed for this (or any of your products), and most certainly would not purchase without knowing if the size meets my needs.I am looking for an aluminum (rectangular) Angel Food Cake Pan.I have seen them in private homes, and know they exist. Will this pan be large enough/work for Angel Food Cake:"
2,"Points for design, but flaws in manufacturing","This is undoubtedly a pretty set in design, but I couldn't overlook the many seemingly permanent smudges, nor the decidedly un-pretty errors in surface finishing.There were minor molding errors, as well, but I've come to expect that from any plastic set made with such fine detail."
4,Elderberry,"strong elderberry flavor. more tart than sweet, would balance out a high sugar for any brewers out there. pretty tasty in the mornings instead of OJ with bacon and eggs."
3,Not working?,"Unfortunately this didn't work for me.The bottle doesn't say how much to take if you already got a cold, it only mentions to take 8 OZ in 36 Oz of water (??) - I tried to take 1 tablespoon straight every hour or so, result? A bad stomach ache followed by a bathroom visit.The taste is a little tart but pleasant.I was really hoping this would work for my sore throat. I started it on the first sign of sore throat but unfortunately it didn't improve at all - maybe I am using it wrong? I have no idea, if you have tips on the dosage pls let me know. ThanksBTW, I tried another brand called Sambucus (by Nature's way) that was full of added sugar (this one has no added sugar which I liked), actually I feel like that one worked much better than this one, at least it told me exactly how much to take for it to work."
1,ingredients are not what are advertised,"The ingredients have changed in this product while still being advertised as preservative free. In fact, the bottle I have now has both sodium benzoate as well as potassium sorbate listed, in addition to apple juice concentrate (which I assume is NOT organic), grape juice concentrate, citric acid, ""natural flavors""(?). I am quite sure that the first few bottles which I purchased did not have these (or did not list them on the label, which would be more upsetting!) I have tried to call the manufacturer of this product and have left 2 messages, but my calls have been unanswered. I think something very weird is going on here with this product. I would like some answers. Until then, not buying anymore and I would suggest others not either until this is clarified."
4,can I get more?,Old game but it's worth to play it. Lots of fun but with only 30 missions falls a bit short. Need to check what the Bitmap Brothers have recenly released though.
4,"Good Game,But a little too hard.","This is a great game.I was a little surprised at the price when i saw that the game had such jaw-dropping graphics.Don't be fooled by the price.For those who have played Dark reign 2 you will be familiar with this one.But, as i mentioned above,This game is quite hard as you get to the 5-6 mission and there are no cheats.So you must be good at Rts's if you want to progress in this one.Overall,this is a great game,very fun and very challenging."
3,English Breakfast,"Item arrived on time. Not the orginal ""English Breakfast"" that I have on tape. It's ok. Not as enjoyable."
2,Disappointing,"I hate to be the dissenting voice here, but I was really disappointed with this book. Where was Nancy Clark's editor when he/she was needed. Her sentences are far too long and overburdened with too many adjectives. Less really can be more! I felt that the plot got lost in a thicket of verbiage and I wasn't sufficiently moved to continue hacking my way through. Pity. It sounded so promising."
1,A good story gone bad.,"I had looked forward to reading this book after hearing such great reviews. After plodding along through the story thinking many times ""it must get better"" I finally turned the last page disappointed I had wasted so much time on it. The editing is just not good - as others have mentioned the spelling and research is lacking throughout the book (they are Canada Geese - not Canadian). You never learn enough about the many, many characters to care about them. A disappointment because this could have been a great book had a better editor gotten a hold of it."
2,The Hills at Home,"This is a tedious, implausible book with a huge cast of characters, none of which you can actually like and many of which you'll actually dislike. There are spots of bad grammar and weird non sequiturs. One thing I cannot understand is how 12 people, more or less, could share one bathroom so conveniently. I was told the book was funny - I waited and waited to laugh, but it never happened. Ms. Clark thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things, but I don't think so, e.g., her knowledge of horticulture leaves much to be desired."
4,the best of their early albums,"A delightful little album of little tunes. Definitely a grower. After a few listens, the album really takes shape. It definitely sounds better when listened to in one sitting. Like one big song with 40 sections. The residents are not great musicians, in fact they're probably not even good musicians, but their music has a charm that is indisputable. I love the funny voices and the lyrics eg 'she called my friend a picnic boy i never could stand that, she called my friend a picnic boy and said he was too fat..'. Give it a try. Thank you."
5,Artifacts is the best CD ever!!,"Gordon Hanley has out done himself on this CD, it is amazing. His words have a strong impact on all of his listeners. We are moved everytime we put this CD in our stereo. For those of you thinking about picking up this CD, we will be the first to say that it is well worth what you are paying for it. It is a great edition to anyone's collection. We are eagerly anticipating more of the same great music we can always expect from Gordon!!The graphic design for the CD is OUTSTANDING!!"
1,Very very difficult to get this to work.,"Ok, I've read the manual over and over, and I could not figure out how, or if you can loop the song, in the arranger. If you can't loop the song, it's of no use to me whatsoever.I need to be able to loop songs for many reasons:The whole experience of being a DJ is to instantly hear the results of the changes you make to the music in real time.I can't use this software as a drum and bass machine to play keyboards with as accompanyment.The price is nice, if I could figure out how to get it to loop, but I gave up, and I'm usually pretty good at figuring out these things."
3,Its OK,tHE IS FUN FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE MAKING MUSIC. (LIKE i DO) BUT EVEN THEN THE GAME GETS BORING KINDA FAST. IF I WAS YOU I WOULD RENT THE game first. (something I should have first).The good side is you can use differnt kinds of music sound etc.The bad side is its kinda hard at first and the contrelling is hard.Thanks for reading.
1,Poor fit for most lenses,I bought this in the hopes of doing a little bit of photography with my Orion XT8 Dobsonian. I was very disappointed that both my lenses fit very poorly inside. In fact most lenses will be too wide to use with this adapter. Forcing one to buy a lens just to fit inside. On top of that the documentation is extremely vague as to how to position the eyepiece. Each time I tried it would never sit completely flat and be able to be secured with the thumbscrew.Very cheap and loose construction as well.
1,I can't believe this book made it into print.,"I would have picked NO STARS had that been an option. If you are a pre-teen, just a day into puberty, this book might seem like a wealth of useful information... even then, it still seems like an AWFUL waste of time and money. I recieved this book this afternoon. I am re-packing it and sending it back... It is only 9:00pm.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
3,Comes Up Short...,"A good introductory to the adult video production business, but it promised a lot of resourses that it couldn't deliver. Mostly the book is designed to send you to the author's two web sites for more info and promised promotional opportunities, but as I am reading Sex & Camcorders, his sites are off line. The book does have some useful information and an adult business directory that is a good jumping off point. If you are really interested in entering this business... this book won't give you an immediate jumpstart, but it will help you down the road."
5,TAKE ME AWAY MUSIC,"THIS WAS THE FIRST CD I BOUGHT FROM DOUG AND IT WASN'T THE LAST.THIS MUSIC PUT A SMILE ON MY FACE AND IT MADE ME MOVE.EMAILED HIM ON MYSPACE AND LET HIM KNOW THIS CAFETERIA LADY ENJOYED HIS MUSIC.HEARD BACK. MY HUSBAND AND I TAKE A TRIP WITH ""JAZZPAN"" MOST SATURDAY MORNINGS WITH OUR COFFEE.WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A TRIP MENTALLY!"
2,DOA,"Plush arrived but does not talk, I can feel that the internal plastic housing is cracked. The doll itself is in fine shape. And at 3 dollars is hardly worth the effort or cost to ship back for a replacement."
2,No sound and no way to get to it...,Well it was on sale and super cheap but the battery was dead and made no sounds and I see no zipper or any way to get to the box inside to replace it.It cost was so low it was not worth even bothering to send it back or complain... still good as a Plush.
1,isn't this thing supposed to make noise?,"Item was shipped quickly and seemed to be packaged well; although it feels as if there is a device inside of the dolls belly (i assumed this was the electronics that emitted the phrases), for some reason it doesn't make any noises at all. Technically i only bought the doll for the phrases it was supposed to say. Oh well, for the $2.99 i paid (with free shipping) I suppose it seems OK. i wouldn't pay full price that's for sure!"
3,Kinda funny,"I only bought this as a gag gift, so it served its purpose. I thought it would say more phrases (it only says 2 different things.) But hey, it was just for fun anyway!"
2,Difficult Reading,"This translation of the Holy Qur'an is written using words that are often too flowery, making it hard to understand the verses. Also, the author inserts a lot of alternate translations of words in parentheses, making it hard to study a particular verse. In general, I would not recommend this translation to first time readers of the Qur'an. However, if you are already familiar with other English translations, this one may be OK to use as a comparison."
2,hmm,"good for an idea of the interpretation of a few scholars, yet not quite true to form or straight forward translation. this edition seems just that, a personal interpretation rather than a straight translation of text. while the effort should be commended, the product thereof is lacking emphasis in the title that this is simply how one or a few translators interpret meaning. The Holy Qur'n seems improper to me, as a muslim reader. perhaps An Interpretation of the Meaning of the Holy Qur'n."
5,Best introduction to the Holy Quran,"This translation of the Holy Quran is the best I came across.The introduction give us a very clear picture of what is Quran all about and how to understand the Quran. Also how to enter to the world of the divine sayings , Especially For a non muslim this Quran give a good understanding.It also write about the prophet teaching in order to understand the Quran.Lastly it uses the simplest english so that any ordinary person will understand it. It is handy in size.It does not have the long commentery but we will have a clear vision of the Holy Quran.May ALLAH bless the author for his hard work."
5,True Meaning of the Holy Text interpreted via this translation.,"This Quran is available in Paperback - English only ISBN978-0-9766972-2-2 which is a continuous large font size reading of the Holy Text. Since I finishedreading this translation I carry this with me everywhere. All misconception about Islam are clarified in this translation. All questions I had when it comesto the religion of Islam, Unity of God, Prophets, Angels, Status of Jesus, and stories of Bible were answer with the help of dictionary support, literal meanings in an easy to understand English. I will recommend this to all Muslims and non-Muslims. This will help solve many bias we have about Islam or the Holy Text. This is nicely printed and is also a very affordable gift."
1,Inaccurate translation,"This translation of the Quran, though aesthestically pleasing as far as print goes, is inaccurate in its translation of the original arabic text. In order to be understood correctly, the translator needs to stay as close to the arabic meaning as possible, without adding any extra words... he can leave that to the commentaries. The Holy Quran translated by Yusuf Ali provides a much more accurate translation."
5,Excellent Bundt Pan!,I love this pan! My husband prefers the Bundt shape to traditional round so I use this pan all the time. My cakes come out perfect every time and the clean up is a breeze. The Calphalon nonstick coating really makes a difference. Definitely a step above the rest!
2,Cake sticks,I made a lemon bundt cake and used Crisco to grease the pan down but only half of it came out. I agree with the previous reviewer that I have a cheap pan that works a little better than this one.
3,New writers?,"I don't know if they got new writers for this season or if they just had an off season but their were tons of cheesy lines and bad puns. Also a lot of the crimes either weren't adequately explained or the physics, mechanics etc. were wrong. I love C.S.I. but compared to the first 3 seasons I thought this one was pretty lame."
4,great show,"I've seen CSI several times and have always meant to buy the DVDs. I haven't yet purchased this season, but I will.The one episode in this season that really hooked me was Episode 8: After the Show. All of the previous reviewers failed to mention that this ""high profile case"" is based on a TRUE story....the death of model Linda Sobek, who was not only a model but a former cheerleader for the LA Raiders. The man who was ""infatuated"" with her was found guilty of her murder (he even led police to her shallow grave) and was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.CSI knows how to grip its audience with edge of the seat story lines. I've got a lot of catching up to do with purchasing these seasons so that I can continue to admire the show and its continuous perfection of how it captures each case/episode."
2,"The first few seasons were good, but this one is a bit dull.","I'm sorry, but I'm unable to rate the fourth season of CSI favorably. Although the first three seasons were fresh and interesting, the fourth one starts to lag. I have found some of the predictable, sarcastic comments a bit tiring and dull. I'm not sure how many times I am going to hear, ""I am with the Las Vegas crime lab,"" or how many times the show features a suspect who is being shown overwhelming evidence of their guilt, and backs down, and reveals their guilt. I think the show is starting to get dull. I have learned a lot of science from the show, but I will not watch another one."
4,A little different from previous seasons,"The characters remain the same; the flavor of the show changes though. This season has lost some of the humor, replacing it with grit and some amazing cinematography. They really caught the desert light, which was something missing from previous seasons. And while I love how beautiful the scenes were this season, I *liked* the humor and the lightness of the previous seasons. It seemed to regain some of this later on in the season, so I'm guessing they had others who were able to review while it was still being aired who felt the same.All in all, I liked it as much as previous seasons - just for different reasons."
1,Not worth it,The product I received 2 disc were too scratched up to watch and the last disc #6 was replaced with disc 4 of season two. The season I ordered was season four.Not happy with my purchase at all.
1,Flimsiest umbrella ever!,"I bought this in November on sale. I pulled it out to use for my 1st summer party on July 4. It was up for 6 days & snapped in half yesterday during a breeze. I have used large umbrellas like this for 10 yrs on my deck & I have never had one that I paid so much for that lasted for such a short time. Some of mine have lasted for 2 years! The metal on this pole is very thin & cheap. It is a nice shade umbrella if you NEVER have a breeze blow. I would stay away from this umbrella & buy something else, maybe from Costco where you don't have to pay return shipping & find a box to send it back in, etc. & they have an unconditional guarantee."
2,Cord broke in less than a year,"I enjoyed the umbrella. I enjoy it no more. The tensioning cord that holds the umbrella open broke in less than a year. I used it two or three times a week Spring through Fall of 2009. I never opened it to its maximum diameter. Coolaroo warranties the fabric but not other components of the umbrella. Caveat, as they say, emptor."
4,Overall a good CD,"Although this material comes from their two last major label releases (1990's Still Standing and 1991's Justice) and does not feature their big hits from the 80's (Woke Up In Love, Give Me One More Chance, She's A Miracle, I Can't Get Close Enough, etc.), this CD is decent compilation for fans that already have their earlier material. Acually this CD only has three major hits (Nobody's Talking, Yet and Even Now) but to a fan like me, is well worth the purchase!"
1,absolute junk,"I knew I was taking a chance buying this because there were no reviews of it .OK they got me.This is William Hellfire's worst work.Misty looks about 14 .There is no plot, no sex, nothing except Hellfire going around with his bottle of cloroform and forcing it into the nose and mouth of his victoms with a small rag.There. You have it all.There is absolutely nothing more.Hellfire has some acting ability in the comic mode and I get a kick out of his British-cockney accent but thats it .And there was no comedy or British accents in this. As far as the stars are concerned I would give it a minus 4 out of five if that was possible but you are obligated to give any movie one.So there!"
2,Predictable Dreams,"Although it is not a bad story, Demon is neither original or unpredictable. Carrie style, unattractive, overweight and unpopular small town high school girl (Lori) gets teased and picked on every day with dreams of having the most popular jock next door neighbour kid as her boyfriend. Of course he's dating the most attractive popular girl (Tracey) in high school whose shallow nature and love for herself is sky high. So when Lori buys a Dreamcatcher and the demon tells her he can make all her dreams come true including being popular, stardom, get the hot neighbour guy, and have vengeance on Tracey and the other popular kids she jumps at the chance. But all dreams have a catch.It's a smooth easy read but like I said it's been done before and you can predict what is going to happen long before you get to each page."
4,Good value for the $,Arrived in a nice box. I feel for the price this is a good gift to give. Kids will be happy.
4,Great Product,This item was for my youngest niece. She had not shown much intrest in baby dolls until I had given her this baby for Christmas. Other than the fact that the pacifier does not stay in the mouth this doll is perfect for her first baby doll.
2,hands that don't hold!,"daughter totally uninterested in this doll and I don't blame her! hands don't hold anything! this is just a standard doll, nothing special."
2,Hands do NOT!!! hold,"Received this as a gift. Loved the sweet thought but the magnets are useless. I can feel a little pull between them but not nearly enough to hold. The pacifier has to be crammed and twisted into her mouth by an adult. It won't begin to sit or hold hands like in the picture. The only consolation is that the loop on the rattle is big enough to slip over her arm and slide up onto the shoulder. Cute, cuddly doll with moving eyes (asleep and awake) -- but it's advertised as ""Hands that Hold!"" I can't believe they sell a product that doesn't remotely do what the title describes. This is just a doll with a paci that's impossible for a young child to use. (Katie, if you see this, sorry for the bad review of your sweet gift! I just thought that others should know the package is misleading. Ellie still loves it!)"
3,Not as pictured,Received this doll today. It is absolutely nothing like the picture. Nothing. Called Amozon immediately. Hopefully no problem to send it back because not not not what I expectd.
3,Buy this CD,"I have bought too many CDs that I never listen to, but this one has been camped out in my dashboard for weeks. As a fiddler, I had to learn Eric's ""Golden Ticket."" But, now I keep listening to more and more subtle things he has going on this recording. I love how he convincingly goes from Celtic to Old-time, and keeps it together with some of the hottest clawhammer banjo recorded. With some tasty songs thrown in, the CD flows well and becomes so listenable that even folks who think this music all sounds the same will fall in love with it. Too bad Amazon doesn't have it in stock today."
2,Easy to sum up - not particularly well written,"While there is a lot of good research in the book, I've read better books on the subject. The author repeats himself endlessly. It's amazing to think this book was whittled down from 600 pages. It could have been whittled down another 150, as the author's final refletions on fat loss can be summed up in a few sentences. He claims to have taken out most autobiographical information to reduce his originally sized book, but his smaller book is still filled with stories about him. There is enough in the book to recommend reading it, but the author, who has a phd, writes so poorly, and has made such poor personal weight loss decisions over the years, it makes you wonder if his conclusions (which I think are correct) are worth following."
5,Proud to be an American Bill Hicks fan!,"Writing from Austin, Texas (Bill Hick's home base), I must say I am saddened and outraged that this release has not been made available here in the land of the free and the home of the brave. It is no surprise that this is a UK import - they appreciated him more over there then they ever did here. Jolly good! I doubt this will ever get a stateside NTSC release. If you have a way to play PAL DVDs, then this is manna from heaven for any Bill Hicks fan. Kudos to the film makers for this awesome tribute to Mr. William Melvin Hicks! The graphics are unique and the film is a true testament to the impact Bill Hicks has had and continues to have as his words ring truer everyday."
2,"Sorry to say, this one didn't do much for me","I am a very big fan of Bill Hicks, and I think that the man was a visionary years ahead of his time. This documentary however seemed to shed less insight into his past than it did give the opinions of his friends. I know that having read the book, seen the Sane Man and other Bill Hicks DVD and that there probably isn't a heck of a lot more to learn so my expectations may have been too high. I'd say that this is worth renting but I'd stray awy from purchasing it unless you are a mega-fan buying it to fulfill a completionist urge."
3,Bad animation interferes with a good story.,"This movie was ... weird. The story is told by the people who were closest to Bill Hicks--his friends and family, and the comedians who worked with him in Houston.But most of the movie is the audio from their interviews laid over incredibly cheesy CGI effects that seem to try to animate still photos. For example, as people talk about Bill Hicks going to London, you'll see a photo of him superimposed inside a CGI'ed London taxi ""driving"" through the city. The lame graphics are distracting and make it hard to keep track of who's talking.It's a shame, because the stories are very interesting and personal, plus there is a good amount of obscure Bill Hicks' videos. The materials that were collected to make this film are so amazing that it's still pretty good -- even though it could have been much better in the hands of a more competent filmmaker."
3,"Works on a Vaio, but not PS3","Are you a Blu-Ray buff? Good.This is NOT region-locked. It WILL play in America, but there's an almost Faustian hitch: You have to watch it on the Blu-Ray drive on a Sony Vaio computer.Playstation 3, the way many Americans view Blu-Ray movies, will only take you directly to the main menu. That is all you will ever see. We tested this on multiple consoles, but none were the Slim version.So, it works, but just barely. I contacted Sony, the very company that invented this technology, and they were perplexed.This is supposed to be released in America sooner or later, but the release date hasn't been announced. So, if you must watch this, buy this with the above advice.3 out of 5. When you can watch it, you'll know you've made a great purchase. Having access to a device that plays the movie? Well, that's just going to take points off."
4,PERFECT SCENT FOR MEN,"This right here is another perfect perfume for men. you can wear it around the clock and for any occasion (casual, club). But you might want to keep it for special occasions, since it's'a bit expensive.It's lasting power is fair enough (5-6 + hours). I give it in fact 4.5 stars.The smell is quite unique with hints of sweet spices and mandarin, and very refreshing.i don't think it's similar to Acqua di Gio. Armani makes great perfumes: A d G, Code, Diamonds.I put it right there with Chanel Egoiste Platinum, which is another perfect scent for men."
3,"Heavy on facts and figures but light on ""how to"" information","Don't get me wrong, this was a book packed with excellent information about the history of dry suit diving, maintenance requirements, and thermal properties of various configurations, but it was not the instructional text I was looking for. I found the text worthy as a guide to making repairs, but found it terribly boring to read. I was hoping to draw on the experiences of the authors to aid in my growth as a dry suit diver, but that is simply not what this text is suitable for. This makes a fine edition to my collection of texts and I will refer to it in the event a repair is required to my suit, but this text is NOT the instructional manual, packed with ""how to"" tips, I was searching for."
4,Very Informative,"We found this book very informative. In addition to teaching the aspects of dry suit diving, it also tells you how to maintain your equipment properly."
5,One Of The Best Short Story Romance Books I have Ever Read!,"I read A Homespun Mother's Day which is one of the best books of short story romances that I have ever read and like the other short story books I have read this one features romances by different authors. Emma's Day by Jill Metcalf is about an older heroine named Emma Porter who finds love with a younger man named Ward Hamilton. Twice Blessed by Rebecca Hagen Lee, is about Lydia Turner who falls in love with a newcomer to her small town named Thomas Sullivan and tries to help his young son Robert adjust to life in a strange new place. Coming Home by Teresa Warfield is in my opinion the best story and is about Rachel Cameron a young lady with a love of reading books who falls for a new comer to her area a writer named Timothy Benton. This book is great and I highly recommend it!"
5,Soul Food: The Final Season,"The entire series is a collector's item. The writing and stories and acting of this drama were remarkable and classic. If you are in the market for television depicting real American stories, look no further."
5,I've got two word... AWESOME and CAPTIVATING!,"This final season dvd set is awesome and as always, Amazon.com got it to me in record time. I love the entire Soul Food series, I have them all now. The show is filled with so many real life situations, circumstances and family issues that we all can truly relate to in one way or another. I love the cast, I love the storylines. It's just AWESOME and CAPTIVATING! I never get tired of rewatching over and over and over... well you get the picture:) We need to start a campaign for a Soul Food Reunion Movie featuring all of the original cast members - no fill-ins please --- thank you! I think its about time to see them together again just one more time, ya think???"
5,I love this series,"I enjoyed the first 3 seasons so much, I had to purchase the final season to see how it would all end."
4,ENDING TO A GREAT SERIES!,IT WAS A GOOD AND DRAMA FILLED FINAL SEASON BUT I WANTED A LITTLE MORE EPISODES BUILDING UP TO THE ENDING...IT SEEMED A LITTLE CLICHE BUT I LIKED IT ALL THE SAME AND I'LL MISS THEM!
5,Love it!,I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the Soul Food series. I am sad to have it come to an end. This is a series to watch with a significant other and spark some serious discussions.
5,So sad this series is over. I enjoyed the series much more than the movie.,"I'd love to get into details, but that's 14 episodes to recap. All I can say is that if you are looking for quality writing, an amazing cast, and great filming you need to buy all the other seasons as well as this one."
2,Good Idea however....,"We bought this toy for my 2 year old son. It is a great idea and he absolutely loved it and with using just water it was excellent for no clean up. However literally about 5 days into using it the drawing part which is a soft material was already getting scratched up which made drawing on the scratched parts impossible. The ONE pen which is basically a plastic tube with a felt tip (think Q-tip) started to come apart in little pieces. About 3 weeks after having it, it was so scratched up on both sides just from basic use that you couldnt see when you drew on it anymore and the Magic Pen tip was compeletly destroyed and leaked. I had to throw it away, which was really disappointing because my son loved the toy and it was a great idea but obviously cant hold up for long and in the end isnt worth it."
4,Great Present!,"My 2 year old got this for Christmas, and it has been a great present! No noise, no mess, no ""mama help"". The string attached to the pen is a little short, and it has one scratch on the surface already, but my daughter doesn't notice/seem to mind. Just bring a bottle of water with you for refills and make sure it doesn't get thrown around. I'm excited to try a floor mat version next!"
2,No way to clean,"The premise for this toy is great and it sounds like such a wonderful idea, but using it reveals a few issues. The most important being the fact that the screen gets grubby-looking and there is no way to clean it effectively. Another problem is that the ""pen"" doesn't hold a whole lot of water, so the doodling fun doesn't last very long. The screen is quite small and is quickly filled with drawings. Turning it over to use the other side is fine the first time, but after that, both sides remain ""drawn on"" for quite some time. I would not recommend this toy."
2,Good idea but doesn't last,"My daughter took good care of her aquadoodle, but after a few months of moderate use the frabric in the center (most used) portion of the board no longer responded to the pen. After repeated attempts to get a hold of customer service, they stated they only back thier product for 30 days.Dissapointed. Seems like a great idea, but didn't hold up well to even moderate use and vigilant care for spills etc."
2,Love the full size mat... Disappointed in the travel doodle,"I bought these for my nieces and nephew thinking they would be great for the car. (We have the full size/at home version.)The travel size has two major drawbacks that the mat does not:The reservoir is too small (maybe about 1/5 the size of the regular pen); you have to refill it much more often.The drawing surface does not dry quickly. I drew on one side and flipped over to the other side and it still wasn't dry yet.It got dirty pretty quickly; I don't know if there's a way to clean them.I'd say if you want to get the aquadoodle, get the large size mat- not this travel one."
2,Not like I remembered...,"I had one of these as a child, I remember having so much fun on it. I decided to get my child one so he could experience the same. The toy I remembered moved forward when you bounced on it, as you bounced it also made a noise that I can only describe as 'a playing card in the bicycle spokes' sound.This toy does not move forward, nor does it make sounds. Up and down are the only things it contributes to playtime. My 18 month old likes it every now and then to bounce on, but other than that he still prefers the push truck, complete with noise for $[...] at Wal-Mart."
5,Great fun!,"My toddler loves this toy. When I saw this toy, I couldn't resist becuase I played with this toy when I was a kid! Built well, not your typical boring ride-on toy. My boy loves the bouncing motion and talks to it like he's a friend. Very cute."
2,"Way to ""update"" a toy and ruin it...","As others have stated, it's amazing that they took out the ratchet-drive feature. They even left in the square axles and the sockets they sit in, but they freespin. Not only did they make the toy uglier than the original, but they neutered it and made it go nowhere fast.Methinks the lawyers or the beancounters got involved at the last minute and took out the only thing that made this toy worthwhile. Did they think they made it ""safer""??? My kids didn't find it interesting at all.Very disappointed."
1,bad choice---waste of money,This was a useless toy and not worth donating because it is too hard for child to use! The toy has no place for the child to hold on therefore small children cannot use it AT ALL! My granddaughter actually told me to throw it away (age3). Don't waste your money on this one.
2,"Okay, but not great","I got this for my daughter for Christmas, and I bought it because it was on sale for $12 at Amazon and thought she'd like it. She has not used it since I tried to put her on it. She's average height, and she could barely touch the ground. She didn't like it at all. I'm going to try her on it again sometime, but if I had paid the $29.99 or $39.99 that some of the stores were selling it for, I would have been mad."
2,okay,"This is an okay toy. I bought it for my 2 year old for Christmas. She's about average height, and she has trouble touching the ground when she's on it. Will save it for when she's taller."
4,still fun after 2 months,"I bought this for my 2 yr old and she is still using it. The 5 yr old likes it too and he is just under the 50 pound weight limit for it. One thing that we all found hysterical about it is the box indicates that it will ""build core strength"". Okay, anyone who has taken Pilates knows what this is all about, but do I really need to worry about my 2 yr old building her core strength? Nice marketing ploy and it may actually be fact but come on. She's 2."
2,Too tall for most 2 year olds.,"First of all. Don't be fooled like most of us were. This is not the original inchworm toy. If you are expecting the classicRadio Flyer The Inchwormversion, you will be just as disseminated as the rest of us. I did not realize there was more than one version.That being said the main reason this toy is not very fun for my toddler is that it is too tall. He is two and still has to use his tip toes. If this was dropped down a couple inches it might be more fun. Also, unlike the Radio Flyer version, this toy does not move forward when bounced on.In short, I recommend any buyer to go try both out at a store before buying here (to get the best price). The Radio Flyer is better, and is priced accordingly, however if you have a tall toddler then maybe this one's for you."
2,Not his favorite toy,"Given as a Christmas gift to 24 month old, 35 lb, grandson. He's an active little guy and loves ride on toys, but he's not very fond of this one. He can get on it easily enough, but it only goes up and down, it doesn't propel itself forward like when we were kids. He prefers his red wagon or Crazy Coupe. Maybe because he can swerve around in those toys.The handle is not comfortable, it stops half around way so my fingers dig into plastic ridges when I pick it up. It was a cinch to assemble, but that's about the onIy positive thing I can say about it. Wish I'd saved my money on this one."
2,So so... but not as good as the original,"Ditto to most of the comments from the other users. My daughter got this last spring. She is very physical, rambunctious, and rough with her toys. The first time she tried making it ""bounce"" the noise scared her and she wouldnt get on it again for a long time. It doesn't roll very easy especially since that is what this toy is designed for. Most of the time she gives up riding it and I end up carrying it the rest of the way home. I hope her legs wont be too long to use it next spring, but I'm not counting on it."
4,A year later and still going!,"Got this last year for a friends son, and over a year later he still plays with this toy .. He LOVES it!"
2,Disappointed...,"I used the jelly roll pan for the first time and it warped horribly. It is a heavyweight pan so I was not expecting that to happen. It has since warped in the oven everytime I have used it and it has not been used in high tempatures. Very disapointed with the product, especially since I paid extra for the Calphalon name expecting to get better quality."
3,It does warp,"I didn't want to believe it when I read the reviews that the pan warped since it's so heavy and sturdy. Alas, it does warp. Although when I made a jelly roll at 350, it didn't; when I roasted potatoes at 450, it warped. So maybe it only warps at higher temperature? I was a little disappointed since I would probably have bought a cheaper and lighter pan if it's going to warp anyway."
1,really deserves zero stars,"i have used calphalon bakeware for almost 10 years and i wouldn't trade it for anything, never sticks or warps. the only piece i was missing was the jelly roll pan, which i received as a gift two years ago. it wasn't as dark as my other bakeware pieces and it certainly didn't work as well. this pan warps it the oven (you could hear the pop) and everything sticks to it. the pan is now terribly discolored from the food that has gotten stuck to it. whenever i use it, i have to heavily grease it with butter or douse it with cooking spray, and even then it sometimes sticks!!!! definitly would not recommend."
1,Pan Warped after second use!,I thought this would be a good pan based on its reputable name. All of my other Caphalon cookware have been great. I used this pan in the oven for the second time baking some potatoes on it and it warped at 400 degrees. This is really unacceptable and I wish I could return it. I've had cheaper pans that I've gotten at Costco and Walmart that have lasted for years without any problems except getting beat up from use. I will not buy any more Caphalon bakeware items based on this discovery.
2,Baking pan,Very thin coating of teflon on this pan and after 6 months it is wearing off. Would not buy again.
1,Warped in broiler!,"This pan is absolute junk- DO NOT BUY IT! I have several Calphalon items, and have been generally happy. However, when cooking bacon-wrapped shrimp in the oven today (on broil-high setting) for just a few minutes, it WARPED very noticeably- won't even lay flat. I'm going to throw it out and find a new one of a different brand.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PAN!"
3,Calphalon Jelly Roll Pan,"I trusted the price & name of Calphalon, thinking it would be superior to my old, cheap and warped pans. But the other reviewers were right! Even this pricey, heavy pan went ""twaanngg"" in the oven. Upon cooling it returned to flat, but it does warp. However, it is nice & heavy, so it won't bend if it contains a heavy load on the way to the oven and it cleans up quickly. But I'm not convinced I gained alot by pitching my old pans, other than it matches the rest of my Calphalon cook/bakeware, so it looks professional even if it does not perform so."
3,works but is brittle,"It's chalk. It draws on anything and is visible on everything that I sewed. It is also brittle. Instead of ordering this I again at this cost I will probably just stick the spare chalkboard chalk lying around, after sharpening it on a belt sander."
5,great,"Super chalk, just perfect for my quilting work.Also great product and the service you provided was great.Thank you"
3,"Great product, but always arrives broken","This product is great for marking fine lines on fabric. I have ordered it twice from Amazon; unfortunately, both times it arrived broken. This is a product that really needs to be in whole form to be effective. Very disappointed with the quality of packaging--needs bubble wrap!!!"
3,Came broke,"I had to order this online cause I'm not in an area with a craft store- unfortunately, the product came broken. Otherwise, it would have been great!"
5,A good item to have is you sew,"A good item to have if you sew, quilt or machine embroider. I find it though a bit high priced."
2,"Great chalk, buy local.","This is really great marking chalk, but the last one I ordered from amazon arrived in several pieces. therefore, I'd recommend looking for it locally instead of at amazon. also, Jo-Ann has comparable chalk for a few bucks cheaper (don't remember the brand. it's not quite as nice, as it's square, but a square is better than a broken chunk of a triangle).I guess, if you're buying a bunch of chalk, it might be alright. amazon shipped mine in a flat cardboard envelope. I doubt their standard airbag in a box would've kept it safe, either, though."
1,Worthless to me,"I got three of these in different colors; red, white and yellow. The red is ok. The white was cracked. The yellow was broken in pieces. Naturally the yellow was the most expensive at $6.54. It was packed in a box between a wheel scrubbing brush and a hardback book. No packing in between, just plastic air pillows on top of everything. I guess the book slid sideways and crushed my chalk. I am very unhappy with this carelessness."
1,Who cares that it breaks.,"It doesn't iron off. No tailor in the world would use a chalk that doesn't iron off. Someone gave me this chalk in a goody bag of tailoring supplies for my shop, and I stupidly used it on a customers cotton pants, and it didn't iron off. Had to scrub it off for 20 minutes. Will never use any of their product again. Oh, and try calling their customer service to ask if it should iron off, a ten year old will answer that has no idea clover makes chalk."
4,Songs sung by really unique people.,I have enjoyed this c.d. because it has some of my favorite songs sung by people who do not sing for a living. I will say this I hope these people stay at their regular jobs.
2,Not so Golden,"An interesting, somewhat eclectic mix of ""celebrities"" covering well known 60's hits. William Shatner is a genuinely funny guy, and his rendition of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" is the stand out track on this compilation. Mae West and Sebastion Cabot are surprisingly better than awful too. The other artists, sadly, are not."
3,deeply touched,"I was deeply touched by William Shatner's emotive rendition of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"". I feel that I finally understand what that song is about. However, I was bothered by the smarmy attitude of the liner notes. It's like it's all a big joke to them. I hope I never become that cynical."
4,Interesting Concept,"This book isn't just for deadheads, although it is aimed at them obviously, but has a little something for everyone who can think ""outside of the lines"" and is in search of wisdom. For deadheads in particular though, this is unlike any other book I have read on the topic, and it exlores the subject matter in a very different way than any other book I have read. Pick this one up, I'm pretty sure you'll find it a keeper."
3,Claire Danes = Bad Crier,"I like this movie, its entertaining, not all that realistic. They got the ""stupid girls in foreign country"" thing down, and the ""sacrifice for a friend"" bit too, But will someone please please please stop casting Claire in any part that has her crying, she has the ugliest cry i have ever seen, complete with the earthquake lips, and she sounds just like cat when he hacks up a hairball, a giant hairball, or maybe its like a donkey, i am not sure which but it makes me laugh everytime."
3,Good movie but...,"This movie is fantastic to portray the depth of friendship. Must watch even though some may not like the actresses cast in the movie.However, I ordered this on the 17th, received today, tore out the plastic, and figured that the internal disc holding mechanism is broken. Oh well, I have CD pocket holders for the disc, not a big deal. However, this is one of the first totally unusable, broken casing disc holder mechanism, I have received."
5,A great movie!!!!,"This is a great movie that shows the the great bond that best friends have! I really enjoyed this movie, people who have a best friend can relate to the feeling that these two friends felt at the beginning of the movie. The movie is sad, but really good!"
2,Reason I didn't give it a one star,"Warning -semi-spoilersOkay, there is one reason I did not give this film a one star. If a young teeny bopper adolescent girl crazed over Claire Danes can learn a lesson about flying off to an unknown place without understanding that country's laws, and stop thinking it's so cool to go away with her best gilfriend and live it up in another exotic locale...then all is not wasted.Otherwise...this movie was really sad. Not as entertaining as the commericals lead me to believe. The girls were too incredibly naive and arrogant while in another country. Depressing stuff."
3,Not bad!,Great performances by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale. It's basically Locked Up: Abroad as a movie. $2.99 is a bit pricey for this film.
5,Love this movie.,"This movie contains great early acting by the two proctagonists. Leaves you with a question mark in your mind, which I love. Ending can be open to interpretation. Worth adding to your collection."
3,This movie is just too cool for its own good!,"Plot with Spoiler Alert: Two girls decide to embark on a last adventure trip to Bangkok, Thailand before going off to college. Through a series of events they end up in a women's prison in Bangkok. In the background, the almost ever-present soundtrack plays hipster-type music from Sarah MacLachlan and other female vocalists.More on this later."
1,rip-off of better film,"This film is a rip-off of ""Return To Paradise"" which is a much better film with a better ending. I would recommend NOT wasting your time with this and instead view ""Return To Paradise"" with Vince Vaughn."
1,A Snoozer,"I wasn't impressed with this movie. There were a lot of logistic and factual errors. Many details were simply not explained or fully developed so the viewer is left wondering how, what, where, why . . . Maybe too much film ended up on the cutting room floor? The film lacks emotion and drama, the two characters are more upset that they are both attracted to the same boy than at the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in a Thai jail (which is more like summer camp than a prison for hardened criminals). Danes is believable but Beckinsale's performance is lackluster."
4,Wow . . .,"This movie is kind of crazy . . . I mean, it's incedibly well done and really makes you think, but man! It's so intense! I cried so many times during the movie that I thought it might depress me for the rest of the week. It didn't though. It's really, really beautiful . . . Sad, yes . . . but beautiful. I would have preferred the language to be a little less crude at times, but other than that I'd tell anyone to watch it, at least once. It really, really makes you think."
3,Bad movie good acting,"The acting in this movie was first rate but the story and all the plot holes were too much for me. You'd be better off seeing Return to Paradise. If you have seen it, don't bother watching this, you'll see nothing new."
5,Great!,"This movie is excellent. One thing I love about it is that it shows true friendship. I admitt, it could have been better, and I actually thought it was going to be. But, if you consider all of the terrible movies out there, this is great."
4,Above Average for a Prison Movie,"The acting was pretty good, and some parts were even funny. I suggest that you rent this movie before you buy it because this is one of those films where it's hard to tell if someone will like it or not. I saw it in the movie theatre when it came out in August 1999, and of the two other people I saw it with, one hated it and one loved it. I thought it was nicely written and had its fair share of suspenseful parts. The ending is a bit surprising, but I won't ruin that for you."
2,"underdeveloped characters, movie of the week cinematography","I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a movie of the week, or another Lifetime Channel trauma of the month movie when viewing this.The auxilary characters seem to be cookie cutter representations of foreigners, and even the talented Bill Pullman is given little to work with.Tight, squared off shots gave the entire film a TV movie feel, and neglecting to use even stock shots of Thailand (this was filmed in the Philipines) never really take you away--this could just as easily been a story taking place in the US.The trite wrap up of the story, based on loyalty and friendship doesn't really work, because Danes and Beckinsale never quite seem to be more than coworkers before the movie moves to Thailand."
2,Disappointing,"This is amazing: The lives of two life-enjoying teenage girls is torn apart from one second to the other. And still, they keep up spirit for months! They don't even seem to suffer in that Thailandic prison! No, it is too unbelievable. Try harder next time!"
4,A great movie that could've been better..,"To be reviewing this movie with utmost honesty I would have to say that I was slightly disappointed. The theatrical trailer factor built up a barrage of intriguing mind hooks, yet the actual score wasn't up to the expectation. I my self was counting days, waiting for this movie to be released on DVD. The weak point of this movie is actually in it's theme, the fact that people will not be positively certain at the end of the movie whether Alice (Danes) did commit what she confessed of doing or didn't. I guess that telling more will be giving the movie out. However, the acting performance was exceptional, and in my humble opinion, I think Claire Danes deserves, the least, an academy award nomination for best actress."
1,Pretty Bad Movie,"Brokedown Palace is bad. How bad is it? It's pretty bad, man.Don't tell me I didn't warn you."
3,"To Kill Time, a movie worth seeing","this movie was powerful and intense. It's also very truthful...I'm glad to have seen it, it woke me up to things I've had my awareness closed to. It also happens to have a great soundtrack!"
5,Unforgettable,"The acting, directing, editing and message of Brokedown Palace are superb and unforgettable. Character development, key to the theme of the film, starts from the very beginning. Suspenseful, heart-wrenching and deeply moving, this movie is near the top of my favorite movies of all time. You won't regret the experience."
4,The love of family is strong,"I read this in one day, it was very hard to put down. From page one it grabs you and keeps you interested in the family mystery that seems to surround everyone. Noah Garrett has two brothers, Caleb and Zach but disturbing information is found and causes a rift. Ten years later, Noah returns home. Having left ten years prior, everyone is in a tizzy over this, no one knew what happened to him. Especially Elle. Elle had that little girl crush on Noah and followed him like a lost puppy dog all because he saved her from a bully in the school yard when they were kids. She is the one person Noah did NOT want to run into in his short trip home. Low and behold, that is exactly what happens. This is a great story of life long love that was never spoken truthfully, a woman's dream and a family broken apart."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!,"Fantastic book! Romance is not my typical genre of choice but this book was highly recommended by a close friend. This book delivered beyond my expectations. The interactions between Savannah and Zach are so alluring and passionate. The chemistry is amazing between these two characters. Sumner's superb writing style is so incredibly realistic and relatable that you can't help but be completely drawn into the story from the very beginning until the very last page. You will love every page of this book and if you haven't already read her first book in this series called ""Tides of Love"" I definitely recommend you read that as well. You will not be disappointed!!"
5,Descriptive Writing Style,"The descriptions that the author gave of Pilot Island and the folks that live on Pilot Island were rich in detail and historical fact. It made you familiar, almost friendly with the characters. This is a masterfully written romance."
3,Looking for a hero.,"Why were the main characters so accident prone? Poor Elle loved to ""plop"" to the ground for some reason. This made her seem immature even though she wanted others to know she had grown up. Noah got nail injuries, splinters, burns from cooking, and his side gashed open during a rescue. If that didn't take the cake, then the love scene where the poor man was looking for his spectacles while his bandages were hanging off did! Pretty annoying and I'm only half way. Poor Noah. He can't have an ego or dignity after that! lol"
3,moves a bit slowly,I liked the spunky heroine but our hero took until the very end of the book to grow a backbone which I did not like. I liked the plot but it lacked e citement until the very end. Sweet but slow moving plot.
4,Good Story,"I have to admit I had a hard time getting started on this story. I don't really know why except maybe I thought this was going to be about something else. But anyway, once I got into the story, it was a pretty enjoyable read. There was good dialogue-it was funny and well thought out. This had good character development and I could picture the scenes described. I loved hearing about Pilot Isle and can imagine how hard it must be to have to rescue sailors from ship wrecks. Zack had to tame Savannah and Savannah had to get Zach to learn how to live again. I would recommend this romance. I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review."
4,great watch,"First off, the shipping was great. I thought it would take longer but I was pleasantly surprised. I wish it had the red invicta & swiss logo on top like the picture, but it must be an updated model (9311a). I almost returned it for the automatic model that it now resembles. I'm going to get an automatic at a later date. This watch has excellent features, the dial holds the luminesence very well.The quality & heft are wonderful. It is a swiss movment(I dont know if that's any better, but it sounds neat). getting it from amazon was seamless. If you want a quality watch at a great price this company has them. My friends with rollies were stunned."
3,"Nice, but has flaws","As others have said, the watch looks better than in the pictures. It does, however, have flaws. First the bezel on mine is extremely difficult to turn. I emailed the company for help, but have not received any response in over a month. I have to remove the watch and use both hands to turn the bezel a few clicks at a time. It takes a lot of strength to move it and takes a few minutes to work it all the way around one time. If you use the bezel a lot, I would not recommend this watch. Second, the band looks nice, but has a ""cheap"" feel to it. That said, the watch does keep perfect time.One advantage to this watch is the band is longer than most watches I've purchased. I frequently have to add links, but with this watch I actually had to adjust the band to be shorter -- a very pleasant surprise."
4,nice watch,"nice watch looks good, ran a little slow had to reset it once see what happens if keeps time a great buy"
5,GrEaT!,"Ok, let's start off by noting the looks of this thing. To put it simply, Its gorgeous. It doesn't look that sexy in the pictures but when you open it up from its nice yellow box with suede pillow and cleaning cloth, it just knocks your socks off. The only complaint I have about it is this: as mentioned in other reviews, the second hand does not stop directly over the dots on the side, but it consistently goes over by about its width, so not really a big deal. All in all, i freaking LOVE this watch. It truly makes you feel like a million bucks just wearing it around places. Oh, and its not automatic fyi"
1,Hubris,"At first, I thought this book was great. I followed Billup's tips to the letter. But, many things weren't making sense. So, I began to reach out to other digital moviemakers out here in Hollywood...Time and time again, professional WORKING DP's, editors and directors would scratch their head when I explained a question I had regaring one of Billup's ""tips."" Repeatedly they'd say, ""Who is this guy!?! That doesn't make any sense!"" Then, they'd show me how they do things, which always made more sense.For instance, the whole lightmeter issue. Billups makes such a huge deal out of it, but every professional videographer I spoke to told me the same thing: light meters are for film!Anyway, like I said... at first I liked the book, as I appreciated Billup's ""no holds barred"" approach. But, as I learned much of his ""insight"" was rather ""outsight,"" I've turned to viewing the book as a load of hubris."
3,"A great read But, watered down Knowhow","I found this book a very enjoyable and easy read. However, what I got out of it technically, as far as digital moviemaking was thin. I realize that everyone has their way of doing things but some of Billups suggestions I found questionable. The message that I walked away with from this book was; There are many ways to make a movie, choose the one that works for you, But that's not what's important. What's really important is the content of what your lensing. Which is a great message, but kind of a strange one for a how-to book. I have to admit that since reading it I've been walking around repeating to myself, what are the three most important things when making a movie; ""Content, Content, Content"""
2,There are better books out there on this subject,"If you want to learn about the process of making a low budget film that's digital this probably is not the book for you. I'm in the process of producing a film (my first) and thought this book would help guide me. It didn't. It seemed to me that the author spent most of the time talking about the techniques to use that would allow the best transfer to film. Don't get me wrong, this is useful information but that's not exactly what I was looking for.So, if you've never made a film before and want to get an understanding of what's involved and your only going to buy one book, don't buy this one. I highly recommend Digital Filmmaking 101 by Dale Newton and John Gaspard (same publisher). This is a great book on how to make a digital film on a low budget. Check it out before you buy this book."
3,Overkill for amateur videographer.,"While this book contains lots of technical information made simple, it's an overkill if you are not oriented in transfering your DV to film. Initially it's so good you can't put it down but 2/3 of the way, unless you want to transfer to film it's an overkill."
5,Big is best!,"I Am a Little Elephant is just another addition to the fabulous big-board large-sized series by Francois Crozat! The pages, that are filled top to bottom with amazing, full-color illustrations, will fascinate old and young alike! These are great books to start your child's growing library. Be aware - they are not all available anymore, and that is truly sad. Don't bother with the smaller version of the large-format books. The impact (in the tiny books) just isn't there. Go BIG."
5,Great puzzle!,I had bought this puzzle for my husband. The puzzle was great made with great quality. The illustrations were well made and had lots of great information of the area. I loved that it had both big tourist spots and some of the smaller ones on there too. This is a great puzzle for anyone who loves the White Mountains or who plans on visiting!
3,Have keypunch; will program.,"When this book was published in 1974, Brier was a lecturer in politics at the University of Southhampton and Robinson was a lecturer in Sociology at Brunel University. The book apparently grew out of a short course on ""computer appreciation"" for political science graduate students at Southhampton.It is mostly based on the authors' own trial by fire--learning to use the rather primitive early computer applications for statistics, text processing and simulation, and learning to program in Fortran where no existing application met their requirements.In a secondary sense, the book itself is a sociological study of the impact computers in academia had on social science research methods and emphasis.Those interested in the history of computing during the late 1960s and early 1970s will find this text of value; others may not."
4,Regrettably Prescient,"Here's an excellent introducion to the Ernabella Mission and the perspicacious author, Winifred, whose observations were earned from a decade of working with the Pitjantjatjara people of the North east of South Australia. It's not a specialist's book, and is mostly free of evengalical cant. For better or worse, I wonder how much updating the good Winifred would need to reprise her text with were that a possibility. The commentary, from my experiences, might well have been penned during the recent decade, not the mid 1960s. Ted Strehlow provides the foreword commendation and he would have been among the very few, of that era, with the requisite articulation and insight to do Hilliard justice. He notes her well-chosen selections from the diaries of the early Auistralian explorers, and if, for no other reason, this book is a valuable read, as it sets the enduring context with rebounding, enduring resonance, for any text on indigenous Australians."
5,More Power !!!,"I installed this on my 4.3 Silverado P/U. It went on fairly easy and only took about a 1 1/2 hours to install. You can feel and notice the difference right away. It almost feels like a different engine. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to increase the power in their 4.3. All the parts are made from quality products. You can tell K&N builds quality products. Also, I saved about $50.00 buying it through Amazon.com"
1,Doesnt Fit,"Product does not fit the new body style. I did not want to improvise or rig something. A product that carries the name of K&N should fit the truck it is ""designed"" for. Very disappointed."
5,Best basic investment to make!,"This is by far one of the best investments that you can make for your truck. Regardless of whether or not you want better gas mileage, horsepower, or torque, this will give you what you are looking for. Already noticed about +2 mpg in the city, and about +3 on the highway. Built to last! Stop thinking about it and BUY IT! =]"
2,anyone? anyone?,so does anyone know of this CD? any reviews from those who are into house classics/progressive music? please share so I know if I'm getting my money's worth. thanks! house and armand van helden enthusiast- rob
3,Not the best,This is an OK Christmas album. Not the greatest as it kind of leaves a little to be desired on both the songs and the sound.
3,CHRISTMAS ALBUM,"NOT REALLY A BAD ALBUM, BUT NOT ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES. I PROBABLY WILL LISTEN TO IT, BUT NOT A LOT."
4,Great harmonies and renditions,"I'm a longtime fan of Frankie Valli, with and without the Four Seasons. This album was recorded with them back in the 60s. It still sounds good today. The A side or first half of the CD has medleys that are terrific! The rest of the songs stand out on their own merit. Frankie's falsetto stands out on Sants Claus is Coming To Town and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. These songs are usually heard on the radio at Christmas time. Other songs featured include What Child is This, Carol of the Bells, The Christmas Song, Jungle Bells (a humorous take on Jingle Bells) and an original song, Christmas Tears. White Christmas ends the CD in a nice traditional way. You can probably get the CD for a discount price. It's worth buying."
3,A solid package.,"The sound is unmistakable, but make no mistake, this a solid collection. Certainly the pop stuff like 'I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus' will be the most familiar, but Frankie Valli and the gang show their vocal chops on 'Carol of the Bells' and ""Joy to the World Medley', among others.***"
5,The Four Seasons Christmas L.P. (Seasons Greetings c1962),"This is a great Christmas L.P. Everyone should own one. It has The Four Seasons at their musicly best. Frankie Valli's vocal rendition of ""WHAT CHILD IS THIS"" had got to be the smoothest version I've ever heard of that tune. It is just a shame that this song is never played on the radio during the holiday season.... Buy it and I think you would agree that this Christmas L.P. is the GREATEST!! EVER!!"
5,Great Music,This is the best Christmas album I have ever heard. I grew up in the 70s listening to the sounds of Franklin Valli every Christmas Day. The traditional favorites are here as well as some fun music like Jungle Bells (Santa visits the jungle) and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. A must have for your Christmas collection.
5,I've loved this album since I was a child (early 70's),"I have the original album my parents got in 1966? and it is my favorite at Christmas. One song got damaged a few years back, and I would like to find it on CD or cassette (or fat chance finding it--another album). As far as the one review's comment about ""Jungle Bells"", that's one of my favorites, because it is completely different than any other Christmas song made at the time. It's not SUPPOSED to be a remake of ""Jingle Bells"" -- it's different. Now I'm 40 and would like MY kids (both preschoolers) to grow up with it also. It's funny and entertaining, but also serious and soulful. A GREAT piece of work for all ages and times."
2,WASTED THE GREAT DRAWING,"Yes, the deck is numbered. The drawing itself is great and that's the reason why cat/ Tarot lovers like me would pay 20 dollars. But I was disappointed from the very first touch!! The card paper is very rough and it will not stand much touching or shuffling. Most drawing are not centred, some printing are not clear and the cards are not cut to the same size!!! I think they have wasted the great drawing and trying to make too much money out of it."
1,Poorly written,"I have no idea if this book will help you or not, I could not get through it, Mr. Green spends most of the book quoting other people so much so that I felt he should probably give some of his royalties to all of the people he quoted. The worst offense for me was quoting JFK, which is done so often by so many."
5,"Without this book, I wouldn't be where I am today!!!","My father came across this book at a bookstore before I started college and gave it to me. It was the most valuable gift he has given me. I got almost all A's and any class that I didn't was because I stupidly didn't follow the method (probable because I thought I could ace it without Green's advice) I am a very happy physician and have achieved all the acedemic goals that I wanted to. ( P.S. My guidance counselor told me I should do TV/Radio repair ) In no small measure I owe my success to this book, if you have a child going to college who wants success, then have him/her read this book. ..."
3,Not as good as I had expected,"The principles are not novel--they are just what the school system has been trying to get you to follow (by the way, not everyone gets to sit in front rows!). And perhaps, the book doesn't go into enough details and you need to figure them out to work toward academic success. If you know what you need to do to get good grades, you don't need this book."
2,Not for students above the sophomore college level,"This book was well organized but lakced the elements needed for success in upper level education. If you are in high school or just starting college it would sufice but if you are jr./sr. or professional school skip this one! A better pick is adam robinson's, what smart students know."
5,"Organization=A's,and it shows you how","I found this book to be a well rounded assesment of the problems that students run into while taking courses. Beside showing you how to improve you study methods, it also show you how to read books so that you understand the full meaning of them, how to organize and write a good term paper, and how to excel at every kind of test(except for standardized and IQ tests). And what he leaves out, he tells you where to find it. This book has helped me a great deal and has renewed my confidence in my school work. Use this book if you are serious about school, because if you're not, you probable won't benefit from it."
5,"If you put in the effort, it will work","The title says it all, it worked for me too. After reading the book and commiting to the techniques, I received an A and achieved the highest marks in the only class I was taking that semester, which was a graduate course in physics. This is something I've never done before in college.I received A's in the two classes I was taking in the following semester, and in one, I once again scored the highest marks.It does take a lot of work, but if you've always wondered how you should spend your time studying for a class, this book has the answers."
5,Best and no nonsense intro to.NET C++,Great Book for experienced C++ programmer to move to .NET C++.Covers all major topics. Great reading. I finished in one night!
5,Nice heavy pans,"Not the cheap aluminum pans you might be used to, these are heavy wieght. Weel made, they cook evenly and clean up is a breeze. Not the pan you use if you plan to cut the cake in the pan, turn it out first and the pan cleans with a brush of the sponge. Essential for the baker."
5,Excellent book that is no longer in print,"This book is hilarious and a collector's item if you currently own it. It was bought by Da Capo books and re-released as ""The Guy's Guide to Surviving Pregnancy,Childbirth and the first year of Fatherhood."" It's intent is to be funny first, helpful second. And it hits the nail on the head every time. People who have the brain of a peanut and don't own a sense of humor (like the other reviewer here) probably shouldn't read it. This book is reserved for smart people with a smart sense of humor that appreciate smart, tongue-in-cheek humor. Everyone else can sod off."
5,ten stars,"Garland was -not- a 'steel' guitarist, (as the editorial review states), but a great session guitarist. He played whatever was asked for on hundreds of hits, usually country or country-tinged pop and rock, but he was one of the greatest jazz guitarists that has ever lived. In spite of his amazing dexterity, he never let a riff take away from the music as a whole, and always had the most beautiful tone. The band, featuring the debut of then-teenaged Gary Burton on vibes, is perfect."
4,half & half,"A compilation of three albums. ""Jazz Winds..."" featuring Gary Burton, Joe Benjamin and Joe Morello, is some of the most incandescent jazz that you'll ever hear. ""Velvet Guitar"" featuring uncredited musicians, is a plodding effort apparently aimed at the easy listening market. Although there are a few superior standards included, the best cut is actually ""Greensleeves,"" probably because the other musicians don't play. (Chances are that they are good musicians but the producer just told them to play like that.) ""Unforgettable Guitar"" with Burton, Bill Pursell, Bob Moore and Doug Kirkham, is somewhere in between jazz and easy listening. There are some nice moments on all three albums, but ""Winds"" with it's tight swinging ensembles and scintillating solo work by Garland and young Burton (his recording debut) is easily worth the price by itself."
3,catchy,"I've never done a review but I'm tipsy and noticed no one has given this cd one yet. These guys wear their influences on their sleeves. Clash, Buzzcocks, and a lot of other bands that came before my time. I doubt I'll be listening to this cd a month from now but currently, I think it's great. It's simple, catchy, and fun. Great mindless summer music. 3 stars might look negative compared to all the perfect 5 star reviews that get handed out on this site but 3 is above average and overall, that's what this is. No songs really stand out to me but if I had to pick out some favorites I'd go with 'tell me, tell me,' 'we don't want you around,' and 'weak spots.' If you read this please check whether or not this review was helpful."
5,Shakespeare: The Animated Tales,"As a high school English teacher, I'm always looking for ways to make Shakespeare accessible to a generation who could sometimes seem to care less about classical literature. The joy of this series is that it includes all of the most popular plays, and every one is done in a different style of animation celebrating some of the world's greatest artistry. The few that I've previewed have been presented very well. The language is maintained, and the graphics help to bring it all together. They're very much like graphic novels, if you've had the chance to view some of those.Anyone interested in trying to make Shakespeare come alive would be interested in these DVDs. They make great examples for the differences in interpretation, also!"
4,Nice toy for adults or teens,"How can the Chinese build this gun, with a laser sight, and sell it for a dollar? That's what I paid! The gun has a nice spring loaded magazine that holds 10 balls. It comes with no instructions so you have to look closely to see the button up near the trigger guard to release the magazine which then slides out of the handle.The laser sight has no way to adjust it that I could see. I modified the slot that it clamps in to in an effort to make it better but it still can't tighten up enough.I use this gun to scare squirrels off the bird feeder and it works well for that without actually hurting the squirrel. The gun seems well built and fairly rugged. Someone complained it was too small but it seems perfect to me. I'm happy with it."
2,TINY pistol...,"Just received it today. Fast shipping and it looks exactly as pictured, except *A LOT SMALLER THAN EXPECTED*. If you're an adult, this is too small for you. It's cheaply made, feels like it'll break in a few minutes of play. you definitely get what you pay for. for $15-$25 you can get a 1:1 scale spring pistol that looks and feels and shoots better and it'll last."
1,airsoft pistol,"well the matter of fact is i bought it for the laser, if your looking for a airsoft pistol i would go somewhere else to buy it. if u drop this thing or cock it wrong it will break.but if your looking for something to equalize your siblings it great beacause it is very short range and not to powerful"
4,Royal Family of Gospels,This is a very uplifting ablum. I am from the old school of gospel. This new style of gospels sounds as if you are partying.
2,Buyer beware!,"Although Calphalon claims this pan is ""heavy gauge aluminum"" it is not. It is steel, with all the drawbacks of steel; weight, rust, uneven heating, etc. It is adequate for the price, but don't expect a high quality Calphalon aluminum pan. It isn't."
3,Limited Use,"This is a nice, heavy-weight pan that would work very well for anything dry. However, the corners are folded and not welded, so trying to roast anything with a high moisture content (such as tomatoes) is problematic. Some juices leak through the corners while cooking, and cleaning inside those folded corners is impossible."
3,"Not WOW, more like DUH","If your church leadership has been satisfied with not attracting new members, and now you want to start thinking about it for the first time, then this book is a great resource.However, if anyone on your staff has any clue about marketing and customer service, the vast majority of this book will be useless except as a successful case study.But hey, it's cheap. Some good stories and ideas in it are worth the price. But this book won't kick your church into supercharged growth. If this book opens the eyes of your church's senior staff, you need to think about replacing them. This stuff is elementary.It might be good for volunteers to read."
1,First Impressions: Creating WOW Experiences In Your Church,I found this to be an excellent resource for anyone understanding that our job as the church is to reach people with the Good News but our guests won't hear our message until they know how much we value them. We demonstrate that through our 'Customer Service' and creating a WOW experience that will bring them back and eventually engage them in service. This is a very practical approach in how to demonstrate the value we have for those people God brings through our doors.
4,"""First Impressions"" makes a lasting impression","First Impressions - Creating WOW Experiences in Your Church is a very easy to read book that has a significant number of useful ideas which can be used and modified for use in the church environment. Many of the suggestions are common sense but not easy to implement. Using the suggestions will put you closer to the customer - in your church. To look at practices in the church from the point of view of customer service will not please all church goers, but it makes sense when we stop to think that everything we do at church ""speaks"" - it sends a message. Are we sending the messages we want to send by having that pile of clutter in the corner? When we great newcomers, do we immediately sign them up to serve on a committee? - it could scare people away. This book provides many ideas and observations worth considering. I do recommend this book to you."
3,Dissapointed...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, hoping the word ""wow"" referred to creative and fresh ideas for welcoming people to church. I was dissapointed after reading it as I felt, while all valable advice, little was new or inspired me. A lot is more valid (like managing parking) to larger churches."
3,"Cameras work well, monitor is just OK.","I have two of these, along with $4,000 worth of high-end surveillance equipment. The cameras work great in well lit areas and have microphones. The monitors have poor picture quality and go bad quickly. I just use them as extra cameras and they hook into my Security DVR, so I use other monitors for viewing output. Good price too."
2,went thru 4 monitors,went thru 4 monitors in 1 1/2 years and there are better cameras out there these only give a b/w 360 line which the picture is garbage so i hooked my own cameras with more resolution on them ........but beware these monitors are garbage they only last for about 6 to 8 monitor and q-see does not sell them separately.......i would not buy......they are junk
1,Has to work to rate!!!,"Item did not have video, audio was working however, one camera had 2 times the volume as the other one. But, with no video it had to go back. I suggest purchase another brand."
3,Cheaply made and the one I recieved was defective,You get what you pay for but I guess it does its job as long as it is not defective. The hardware is clumsy and light but if stapled down correctly into a permanant spot I could see that it would work ok. Do not expect much but it does its' job and is expected to be what you paid for it. If you are low on cash and need a security camera system this is the one for you. Otherwise spend a few more bucks for better quality.
2,Hind Sight,"I bought this monitor to install in my nursery and my toddler's room. I wanted the ability to keep and eye on both rooms as my children slept. The monitor had all the features I wanted and was cheaper than any alternative. Unfortunately, the monitor needed to be hard-wired. This would not be accomplished easily nor could it be hidden. This camera is NOT intended for the purpose I had in mind."
1,Beware vendor on this item,"Read the reviews, and ordered this. When the box arrived it was obvious that the original factory seal from Q_See was ripped open and a new seal had been applied on top of this.The vendor sells this as NEW - it isn't NEW. It's a reconditioned unit.The Q-See website sells many reconditioned/used items, and that's where they got this unit. If you want to buy reconditioned Q_See items then go directly to the Q_See website and save yourself some money.Items inside the Q_See box itself, were in torn inner boxes, thrown together. I would send this back to Amazon, but it's rather heavy and I've spent enough money already on this.Amazon's quality control gets worse every year.Buy this in a real store and save yourself a headache."
1,Poor construction,"I just spent half an hour wrestling with trying to snap on the top to this brand new litter box. Except for the fact that it is full of litter, I would have returned this box in a heart beat. Do not buy this box - there are plenty of litter boxes out there that don't have this problem. Bad bad design."
3,not as Large as expected; flimsy shipping box - came broken,I was dissappointed with the flimsy box the litter pan came in and one edge was broken I assume from bumps in shipping. I have some large cats and they won't use it because while its tall its not very long.
4,"I really like this product, but it's not very large","I have 2 of these in the jumbo size. I inadvertently ordered a Large, and was surprised how small it seemed inside. If your cat is petite, it would probably be fine, but if your cat is on the large size of average or bigger -- or if you have multiple cats, I would go for the Jumbo size."
5,Chester-Approved,"i got this litter box when my kitten, Chester, started throwing the litter all over the floor after he learned to dig properly. At first, he was too scared to use the litter box with the lid. I ended off taking leaving the lid off at first. He didn't make much mess with the lid off because of how high the sides are, after about a wk, I put the lid on & he hasn't had a problem since."
1,Cheap Quality Control,"The plastic molding around the hinges/snaps (or whatever they're called) is so poorly made that you can't lock the top to the bottom. If you lift the handle, the top comes off instead of picking up the whole litter box.It would be a nice litter box otherwise - but this is a pretty big flaw as it's a hooded box and all."
1,Feline urine and fecal matter spilled in your home,"When the litter-box is full and carried by the handle, even when the top portion is locked correctly, there is a strong possibility that it will detach spilling the feline urine and fecal matter in your home."
2,If the top would stay on,The litter pan itself is of decent quality but my cats are constantly knocking the top off. I gave up using the top and the plastic flap falls off easily. Not what I had in mind for a decent hooded litter pan.
2,Not for Large Cats,I have a few large-20lbs cats. They will not fit in one of these litter boxes. Unfortunately I ordered three of them.
1,Complete waste of money!,"The jumbo Petmate hooded litterbox does NOT come with a door! I found out that you must order one separately from the Petmate company. I think it was around $5.00 with shipping. Upon receiving the door, I find this flimsy piece of rubber which was approx. a half inch too small on each side. Completely worthless. I ended up buying a flexible sink liner and rigging a door which still doesn't fit quite correctly but it's better than the one they sent me. The design of the box in general is amazingly crappy too. The whole thing is a total piece of junk that I will be replacing again very soon. What a waste of money!"
3,Perfect for kittens and small places,"This box works really well without the lid, if you have cats that like to dig a lot. The high sides keep most litter in the pan. As the other reviews state, the snap locks don't work well enough to carry the pan by the hood. Aside from that, this is a good box for a kitten or a tight space.Of three cats that have used this box, one had a problem with peeing on the edge of the entrance, due to the size, but the other two larger cats didn't have a problem. If you have larger cats, or multiple cats, do yourself and your cat a favor and buy the full size box."
2,Too Small,"Don't go for the description that this is a LARGE litter pan. My cats can barely turn around in it. The outside measurements are 18.6"" X 14.7"" X 9.8"". It is about an inch or more smaller than that inside. More like 16.5 X 12.5 X 6"" (6"" being at the front)."
2,litter box,"The litter boxes are nice (I ordered 3), BUT they are much smaller than advertised. Before I placed the order, I measured the big boxes I had and the new ones should have been the same size, but they're not. I'm keeping them, but I won't buy litter boxes from the internet again."
1,not happy,I guess I should have known with the price that this was not going to be a top line product. The top pulls off when you try to lift it up even when it is empty. VERY CHEAPLY MADE. I would not recomend this product
1,BEWARE this and all boxes that use similar side latches,"Side latches are cheap garbage. They can NOT support a box filled past halfway. Lift by the top handle and they'll dump the bottom and the litter all over the floor at the worst possible moment.As they wear out, they only get worse."
4,"Not the most comfy, but adorable","(I wish more people would write reviews on Amazon of the shoes they buy here! They sell thousands of shoes but no one seems to review them...)These are not the most comfortable shoes I own. The big toe of my right foot tends to get a blister from the peep toe. I think because they are made primarily of fabric, they don't stretch as much as, say, leather would.That being said, they are very pretty and make my legs look great. Although the heel is high, since it's a wedge, it's much easier to walk in than - say - a stilhetto shoe with a heel of the same height.They look good with jeans but also with flirty dresses."
4,Tasty,"Heard them at ozzfest and promptly bought the album from amazon mp3. They are a great metal and the whole album is worth listening to. they are a little lighter than I'm used to. I would compare them, in the aspect of aggression, to korn maybe some slipknot, disturbed. Still heavy and fast but maybe toned down for the mainstream... Anyway no matter how heavy they are they still rock!"
3,"OK, not worth the price","Bought this for a girlfriends birthday. It came in a nice but very plain box and was shipped quickly. Upon opening the box it had a cheezy 'appraisal certificate' that was dated in 2007, claiming the bracelet was worth $830. Yeah, right! I don't think so.Anyway, it's nice, the quality is decent. But basically this is overpriced for what it is."
5,Library of Christian Thought,"There is no denying that the Oxford Companion to Christian Thought is a very expensive book, but as it is something like an entire library in one book, it sure is worth its price.You can have a look at the table of contents to see what you can find in the Companion. The essays are written by brilliant and committed theologians, there isn't even a whiff of the dead prose of encycolpedias.The stress is on contemporary theology, but the excerpts which are accessible here show you that the history of Christian thought is well represented too.Christianity is more than just your local church and your local preacher's views. This book gives you an idea what has been going on all around the world in the past 2000 years. There is much to learn!"
4,oldies but good,"almost know the shows by heart but still enjoy. Watch and wish any of this could ever happen in a ""real"" courtroom."
4,Not as great as the other seasons,"I grew up with Matlock and love the show, but by the end of season 7 it seemed to weaken(Just my opinion). I still enjoyed season seven and may Andy Griffith RIP."
4,Matlock seventh season,"Classic Ben Matlock, with addition of his daughter who is also a lawyer. Conrad still there as investigator as previous season. A few episodes have new angles without the usual trial finishes."
4,Average Joe CD Unsigned and Fine,"This CD, in my mind, represents a few different cultures all wrapped into one. There is a hint of raggae, mixed with rock, pop, and indie. Very talented artist who in my opinion, should have had a much bigger career. On this CD, his version of Seal's ""Crazy"" is one of the best I have ever heard, and it is the only cover song he does on here. All the rest is his original music. This is the type of musice that will always be current and the lyrics will always be relevant."
5,Goes above and beyond,"I bought a number of these O-Clamps to attach various pieces of equipment to DJ trussing. I have used them to connect things as large as a 32"" lcd monitor, and they work great. They are quick and easy to attach and are strong enough to hold as much weight as the truss can support."
2,Baffled by good reviews...,"Guitar center was out of c clamps so I got two of these in a pinch. They are plastic. The clamping screw easily cuts it's way through it's own seat when trying to tighten these up enough to get your lights to hold position. On 1.5 inch DJ light stands they seem nice, they look nice, but they do not hold position. With the insert out, on 2 inch global truss, they do not hold position. If you just dangle your toys off the pole and let them point where ever they fall, these work great. If you like to arrange your lights, have control of where they point, and want them to stay there, skip these and get something made out of metal with real clamping force. If scratching up your truss pole bugs you, you may seriously want to consider another hobby."
5,Very heavy duty,This clamp is great and is very heavy duty. It holds all my lights and can be made either a 1.5 or 2 inch clamp. It. Can support 40 pounds.
1,Lose on my truss,"Don't buy these o-clamps they do not work, they are very cheep have to reto fit work on my truss system. you get what you pay for...think twice"
2,100% mathematics,"This is a mathematical approach to x-ray diffraction. If you want a more technical, less abstract book (with some history), order the Sir L. Bragg book. That one is much more comprehensible, actually enjoyable."
1,Definitely not a book for beginners...,"This book can probably be good for anybody looking for a specific information about X-ray diffraction. For this price really cool. But please, definitely not for anybody who has never heard about diffraction and really wants to understand this topic. Book has very little sample examples not completely solved and explained. On the other hand, it containes a number of really complex problems without any results! Take a look at another book instead."
5,"Spectacular Photography, Great Narration & Music! Top Notch!","This splendid video will take you to the Oregon's wonderful coast and Lighthouses. It is spectacularly shot, dramatically written, and well produced. You will not be disappointed with the well read narration reminiscent of Charles Kuralt himself. The rich history is told dramatically told through historical photos, crisp images with dramatic lighting and even old ghost stories. The beautiful and relaxing soundtrack is written by the multi-talented filmmaker himself.This is not your typical dry news documentary with average daylight photography and academic narration ... but rather a wonderful dramatic story of Oregon's lighthouses, their history, their beauty, and splendor. A must have for any lighthouse lover to add to their lighthouse collection!"
5,For my sister,"In memory of my loving sister, Kathryn Marie Hall-Beckner. We truly miss you. See you again, all in God's timing. Love your sisters, Patty & Linda"
3,too big,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
5,Beautiful and Relaxing!,"A gentle sample of fine, traditional Japanese music at its best. Highly recommended for the novice - ""1st timer"" - as well as those of more cultured taste. Hauntingly beautiful."
4,Super-relaxing,A very good introduction to koto music and a lot less cheesy than the concept would suggest. The first track is by far the best.
3,Good advice,"Paul Fredrick offers reasonable quality at a reasonable price, if you watch for sales. The silk and wool slacks just purchased have a nice drape and subtle sheen. Shirts I've bought are true to size (I wear 18 x 37 dress shirts) and the finish above average. My advice is to go to their web site and get on their e-mail list."
2,Mac compatibility problem,"After I installed this card in a Mac G4 running OSX 10.3.5 the computer would no longer sleep. If put to sleep, the machine immediately woke up again. After the card was removed, the computer again operated normally.In response to an email query, IOGear sent me the following reply: ""Thank you for contacting us. Your problem is an Apple related issue in which some Macs will read the card as an active source of information, even if the card is not in use and can prevent the computer from going to sleep.

5,Tehillim speaks to the deepest needs of the soul,"I like to have an English translation with Tehillim. Though I know Hebrew quite well, and I know too the real feeling of Tehillim is only in the Hebrew the English helps me often understand a word or passage I am having trouble with.The Artscroll Translation is often awkward. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of all their interpretations. But the fact that they do what they do out of a position of faith in Hashem often gives their perushim a special strength.This is a Tehillim which should be in the person's personal library along with other translations and perushim."
5,Unique,"Although I am not Jewish, this is a very comforting & good way to read the Word. It is set in the Jewish format of right to left vs. left to right. Highly recommend."
1,Sucks,I cheaped out and bought this one instead of the more expensive one. It does not get at deep muscles and made my skin dry.
5,Excellent.,"i still need to learn more to understand completely the given material, but a very lucid book and a good source."
5,Best Christian Movie I've seen.,"The acting, production and story line were the best I've seen in a Christian movie hands down. You don't have to dodge sex scenes and language in this movie.The script was well written and the acting was excellent. It's good to see a higher quality production for a Christian movie where a wholesome message is delivered with excellence.You can show this to your whole family with no inappropriate surprise scenes."
5,Better than you'd expect,"I saw this movie in the theater. Dont expect it to be original, but then again dont expect any new movie to be original nowadays. Despite its familiar story-line, ""What If"" is a great movie. Its one of the few Christian movies that actually has a good amount of humor in it. Whereas, most Christian movies are so dramatic, they can leave a person feeling depressed, even if it has a good message. If only more movies were like ""What If""."
3,What If....,"It was ok. It was a typical movie that you have seen the plot in many other movies. Ending was great, but I had to keep waiting for something to happen or change. Young people would loose interest in this movie."
5,Excellent movie!,"Excellent movie, with a great message and humor mixed in. Hollywood needs to make more movies like this that have to do with reality and make people think about their life and eternity, as we all are accountable to God for accepting or rejecting Him. Highly recommend this movie for all!"
3,"Rip off of ""Family Man"" premise, not done as well, however!","The premise of this movie is a complete rip off off Family Man (Nicolas Cage), and not so well done.The beginning and middle of the movie are slow, tedious, and difficult to get to the point, but the last half of movie makes it worth watching."
3,"Good movie, but not great","More of a inspirational film than Christian, it is well cast and looks great. Until I started watching Nicholas Cage in FAMILY MAN one night. Now WHAT IF seems like a cheap rip off they tried to mix some faith elements into. An F for unoriginality. It's practically plagiarism, if you watch scene by scene FAMILY MAN and compare it in the first few scenes.It's a fun movie though and worth watching once."
4,What If,Spent a fun time with my whole family watching a movie that i did not have to get the remote to fast forward any sceene. We laughed through out the movie especially my teen kids.
3,Enjoyable Family Movie,"I enjoyed watching this movie. The story line was similar to ""The Family Man"" starring Nicholas Cage and Tea Leoni and I liked that movie too. John Ratzenberger as an angel was ""priceless"" and added wit and humor to the story. I bought the movie when it came out on DVD and we have watched it several times. Certainly worth owning."
4,What if,The movie was good and worth the purchase. Anything that goes against the establishment and is clean with a good message is a good movie to me.
5,Something to think about,"We've all made wrong choices in our lives, but if we truly seek God's plan for out life we will be led down the path He has chosen for us. Much better than the path we chose!"
2,Disappointed,"I always get so hopeful when I hear that a Christian movie is coming out and then view it and once again, disappointment. When I finished it, I was so glad I didn't pay money to see it in a theatre. It is completely predictable(not nearly as good as Family Man). Now, I think a lot of Christian movies are cheesy but still enjoyable. Not this one, sorry. And also what constitutes a Christian movie? clean? moral? or a gospel message that is Biblical? This one passes on the first two but the Gospel message is lacking if not completely missing. Definitely a social gospel if anything. In my opinion, if the message of Christ is not present then don't call it Christian. Call it family-friendly. I'm still hopeful that someone will put out a decent Christian movie with a Gospel message that is quality and entertaining. Still waiting. Another movie marketed to the Christian crowd that happens to have a church in the setting."
1,Not a winner,"If you're a real Christian who was blessed and edified by movies like Fireproof, Facing the Giants, Courageous, and Sheffey, then you'll feel like you wasted a few hours of your life watching this movie. It's terrible. I don't have time to note the details, but I really hate this movie because I love Christ. That's the long and short of it."
2,weird???? movie with a good ending,"Very strange. The ending saved it. The ending gave a brilliant salvation message. The last two minutes or so made it worth a two star. If it wasn't for the ending, I would have given it a one star."
1,God is not a fantisy,You can not call this a Christain movie. The true God does not do anything by chance. It is or it is not. This movie draws in doubt and wishes which are against the Truth and Ways of Jesus.
1,WHAT A FRAUD!!,"This film is a complete rip-off of ""The Family Man"" which debuted in the year 2000.Over 10 years later, this ""christian"" film steals the story line from The Family Man. HOW UNCHRISTIAN! Jesus never taught to steal from others for your own selfish gain and benefit!!This film is a disgrace and the filmakers should be ashamed of themselves for their thievery and unethical behavior!!"
4,very nice,Loved seeing Manistee Michigan as a movie settingThis movie is a clean Christian filmEnjoyed it with family of all ages
4,For people with plenty of free time...,"This book as the name suggests explores the concepts of RFID through projects. This book is excellent for people who have free time and would like to get some hands on with RFID. However, all the projects require the kit which is another $90. If you do not have time for all this, like me then this book is probably a waste of time."
3,"Only purchase this if you can write computer code, and are experienced at taking electronics apart and then together again","I purchased this paired with an assortment of RFIP chips, in different shapes and sizes. I have in the past written code, though I haven't done much, other than SQL, in the past couple of years.I found that my programming skills were not up to some projects, and I could not get the Phidget software to do much of anything on any of the three Windows XP computers I tried it on.That being said, there are some non-programming projects that simply involve modifying every day items such as door locks and keyboards. For these projects, the appropriate tools are required, as is some experience in using them.I would have enjoyed this a bit more if the included RFID tags in the package had better supporting software."
1,RFID Story Book,"This book is all about the basic story of RFID uses, it does give you picture what is Doors, windows, and advice you where to buy electric Deadbolt, nothing but an idea of an open box. I guess the writer of this book just begin to learn electronic world, I bought this book med of November 2012 becouse I am expecting something interesting inside but it tricks me on its colored cover. my advices, if you are curious learner dont waste your money in this book, dont get by its cover and its true this just a ""Toys""."
2,For Begginers,"This is type of book for begginers on electronics, explain on the easist way to build a electronic product by your own."
1,Definitely not suited for a degreed engineer...,"This book is pretty much worthless if you are looking for any sort of detailed technical content or information regarding to RFID applications and 'how it works'.If you are looking for a few 'cookbook' projects to try out then this is kind of good for that, but still not overly impressive.The author is definitely not an engineer and is just an amature trying to spread some vague information about an technology subject that is much more complicated than is explained in this book.Buying this book is not a wise of money, in my opinion!"
1,The Leak maker,"I purchased this recently and thought that because of the Krups name it would be of high quality. Well, wrongo! Everytime we would make coffee the machine would have an 'accident' all over our counter tops! I thought coffee makers were supposed to be ""house broken""?No more Krups unless they teach it better manners!"
1,Customer Service NO HELP!,I purchased this coffee maker just after Christmas 2005. It leaked water all over the counter and was replaced by Krups. The replacement unit is now doing the same thing. Customer service will not do anything because it is over the 90 day replacement warentee. After reading other customer reviews you can see they have a design defect here....and should issue credits for this defective coffee maker. I will never purchase another Krups product!!!
1,Krups FMF4 Assessment,"Really bad coffee maker. Water level indicator gets bubbles on filling, defies measurement. Carafe opening too small, difficult pouring. Cheap door assembly, falls off. Water level indicator too small to read."
1,Waste of money,"Worst coffee maker I have ever owned. Dose not make hot coffee. You lucky if you get 5 cups, but that should not matter coffee won't stay warm more than 40 minutes. E-mailed Krups their no help. Last Krups product I'll buy."
1,was this ever tested by the company?,"I replaced an older Krups with this machine because I really loved the older one and assumed that all of their machines would have been of equal quality -what a disappointment!It is difficult to understand how a company with the reputation that Krups has established would allow a product on the market with so many design flaws.The machine is difficult to fill with water,the glass water level indicator fills with bubbles and is useless. The carafe leaks when pouring and you have to remove the cap to pour the last of the coffee.I am going to use my old machine until it dies and put this this one under the sink for dire emergencies."
1,Don' t buy this product,"After 2 months, the program timer stopped working. It makes a decent pot of coffee, but I specifically bought this product for the ease in setting timer. It should not have stopped working after 2 months."
1,Over-priced piece o' junk,"Their is nothing about this $100+ plastic coffee maker that is better quality than the average Mr. Coffee.Every problem mentioned in the other reviews I have had also, with the addition of the basket door pops open whenever I pull the overly tight fitting pot off the warmer.Dribbling water on the controls at the very least shorts out the LED display but, on the off chance more is shorting out, it would be wise to unplug it as it is a potential fire hazard."
2,Not What I Expected From Krups,"After purchasing three of these, I've decided to give up and purchase another brand. The first one leaked all over the counter and the second and third had faulty water level indicators. This was the first Krups product I had purchased and I will probably not purchase another. All in all, I would not recommend purchasing this coffeemaker."
2,Returned this...,"I've always believed Krups was a very good, reliable brand. It may still be, but not as far as this coffee maker is concerned. I was very disappointed in this product.The carafe was the main reason I bought and returned it. It did not keep the coffee hot and it's a very awkward design. Very big & ""bulky"". When you get towards the bottom of the pot, you can tell there is still coffee in there, but you have to turn the pot upside down to make it come out.I have a $5.00 carafe from Walmart that keeps the coffee warmer than this one does. And keeps it hot overnight!Good things I can say about it is your coffee is done very quickly, tastes good and it's easy to program. But for this price, I'd go with another one."
5,GREAT!!!!,If you understand the true sounds of reggae roots.....then you may understand where i am coming from.....after the muiscal growth of Bob and the mighty wailers.....we are still blessed with Spear! keep burning....1luv
2,Marble Badness,"I bought this thinking it might be fun to play with my friends. The horrid single player mode with bad music is not recommended. It was sort of fun until one of us figured out if you just leave your marble unmoving in the versus stages, everyone else will run out of mojo first because they are moving. At that point, it was a totally bad game.Recommendation: Don't buy it."
4,Great Game.,I like this game a lot. It's fun. A little challenging (I haven't gotten past level 7 ever) but it's great. My friends like it as well. If you like puzzles and stuff get this game.
4,Awesome game!!!,Wow... i played this game and it is adictive! i couldent stop playing for 3 days in a row... for 10 bucks is worth it...
5,An Instant RPG Classic,"If you liked Star Ocean :The Second Story you'll love this.In my opinion this is the best RPG ever made.You play as 3 charectors,and it is so long and so fun,you can't explain it."
4,Not a bad game at all; especially for the price!,"Picked this game up because of the price, and I'd have to say that I definitely won on that deal (over 60 hours of game time). The battle sequence is pretty neat as you tell your character what his/her moves are to be and then sit back and watch the fight. This game I felt to be very easy to play. You catch on to what needs to be done in no time at all. Yes I'll agree that you move at a snalls pace between towns but it don't take one very long to do it. I thought the story line was not so bad. The characters were good; however, Noa at times is too whiney. But at the same time her innocence is cute. Songi, by the end I wanted to strangle him, the bully. One other feature I liked about this game is that with the many, many hours of game play there were only a few instances when the characters swore. This is nothing in comparison to other games I have played. In the end I'd have to say that it was definitely worth the money payed for it."
3,Not a bad game.,"This game is okay. It's a good beginner title. The battle system is fun, but it gets repetitive after awile. I recommend renting this title insted. If you want a really good Rpg get FFVII."
4,Battle for humanity falls short,"This game started out very good, good graphics, good plot, good storyline, but later it got somewhat repetitive. The ending was a little off center, but other than that it was ok. I say 4 stars because after a while the plot got kinda boring. Way too short a game. It also needed a lot more secrets. If you are looking for a good, short play I recommend this one."
5,Legend of Legaia,"I'm still doing this game, and so far its been interesting and fun! Noa (One of the video game characters) is a little stupid, but everyone else is good. This is the newest game I've got, and it's the only one I play the most! I've found it very enjoyable."
4,Great Game with a Single Flaw,"I loved this game, I bought it not knowing what it was and I got sucked in by its originality... I love how you can summon the enemies you defear (well some anyway), and It had a good story line, and great graphics and gameplay. The one thing I didn't like was the battles... they're GREAT at first, but after a while, they get repetitive, take a while, especially when trying to kill without magic, and the boss battles are almost all the exact same thing after you learn certain things... I was easily able to put up with the game though because the rest made up for it!"
4,Awesome,This is one of the best games for playstation thats why i gave it 4 stars. I only gave it 4 though because it is really slow but other than that it is an awesome game. The story is great and the fighting style is great. You get to create your own combos and unlock secret combos as well. Then use those anytime you want. For the person that said this game was boring in the first 5 minutes they are TOTALLY wrong!!!!!!!! This is the best game for playstation. You can play it more than once and it is still Fun. In the game it makes you make choises when someone asks you a question so that makes this game AWESOME and THE BEST GAME for playstation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,You gotta get this game!,"Question: Why should I buy Legend of Legaia?Answer: Because its an absolutely great game.Details: Great story, great characters, good graphics, excellent battle system. No other RPG has a battle system like this. Its long--but if you don't like long you shouldn't get into RPGs. Each Character has their own distinct personality which makes the game that much more interesting. So what are you waiting for?. . . GET THE GAME!"
5,I LOVE IT,"I love this game.But it isnt the best I have ever played.But here are my thoughts on it,I think it is great for the youth.But it does have its faults First of all it takes to long to level up.Second of all you encounter too many evil seru and animals out of the major places than in the duengons.I love this game so much because if you are new at rpgs you can get some experiance in this game for the more challenging games.I think you can play this game all the time Im so into it I think about it at school I dream about it.I even love it so much I wrote this review about it.If you are buying this for a child or for yourself I think you should buy it and enjoy it.Myself being the greatest gamer on the planet took me 1 try to beat the final boss.But even if tour not the greatest gamer in the planet(like me) you can still enjoy this game. (please do not talk about my message because i have heard the rumors you mean people) :("
2,This is why games shouldn't be made/released so quickly!,"Though Legend of Legaia begins with an entertaining episode, it quickly falls apart after the first few minutes. The menace, an evil mist machine that launches monsters into the world, is uncreative and not very menacing at all. The characters have almost no personality, and Noa in particular is ridiculous. Though the combat system is new and kind of fun, the difficulty of the battles and tiny amount of experience and gold (combined with the incredible amounts that the player needs) are devices used to lengthen an otherwise tiny, unimaginative game."
2,Horrible,"As a very experienced rpg player, I can honestly say that this nearly the worst rpg i've played in my life. Nothing can describe it better than the word ""horrible"". The fmv's (whatever fmv's there were) were bad, storyline was bad, and the overall feeling in the game was bad. The only redeemable quality this game has (the reason for 2 stars) is the fighting system. Even in this horrible game, the fighting system shines through. However, it's not enough to make this a fun game. To save you hours of playing time, here's the entire game's story (beginning - end). You find out there's a bad mist and you must stop it. You find the source of the mist in the deep recesses of a dungeon of some kind and destroy it after fighting through hordes of random encounters, ending with a boss. Rinse, repeate, and be incredibly bored a few more times and you have played lengend of legaia. This game is almost as bad as Quest 64."
1,What a ridiculous...game,"My title says it all. How do I hte ths game? Let me count the ways. First, the player does absolutely no battle. He merely picks the moves and the computer fights. Also, the plot makes absolutely no sense. It is completely [sensless]. It's also filled wih thousands of endless sequences that are impossibe to skip. I only played the first level before I literally decided to take an axe to the game... It ges negative 10 stars."
4,A dandy guide to coastal California birds. Nicely done,"I live on the Southern California coast, and I wanted a book that would help me quickly identify the birds I am photographing, and tell me a little bit about them. This book does the job; it has excellent photos of the various bird species, and interesting write-ups about them. In the appendix there is a nice discussion of the various ecological parks and preserves in Southern California, and what types of wildlife one might expect to see there.A good value."
3,"helpful, but...","The book is helpful, and easy to find categories of birds. It is not a complete guide, but since it says introduction, that is what it is."
1,soviet view of the jewish state,this is anti-jewish propaganda that came from the same people who brought you the pograms--the russian government.they attempt to hide their anti-semitism by stating that they supported the jewish people but not a jewish state.the writer of this piece of trash should be ashamed of himself. this pamplet is a study in twisting and deliberate slanting of the truth. if you want to read A DELIBERATE STUDY OF LIES then check this out---just do not eat before you do - you just might get sick-- richard--south georgia-
3,you can't fool mother nature,"I just finished this book, and have the usual frustrations mentioned by other reviewers. I actually did find the characters interesting, but the end of the book happens so suddenly that one's first thought is - what happened? did he get tired of writing or something? Instead I think it's sort of a heavy handed symbolic gesture, after all the surveillance occuring in this book, not just by the government but also by most of the characters, it turns out that it's meaningless, in light of the catastrophe occuring at the end of the book.i can't recommend it higher than three stars, but it does make one ruminate over the ideas and theories presented, all of which is unsettling (no pun intended considering how the book ends!)"
4,Where is part 2?,"I planned on giving this book a 5 just based on how much it hooked me, but I just finished it and it simply ended, no closure what so ever. Not that he didn't close everything he didn't close anything. Almost as if there is a part 2 floating around. I don't care for ""to be continued"" in the least bit. All that being said he did an amazing job with his characters, I want to know more about all of them.Did Tad die?Was August a fraud?Did the building get demolished?What did Aidia do with the $1mm?Did lucy finish the GQ article?Did Charles get exposed?"
3,The book had no ending...,"I enjoyed reading this book immensely until I came to the last page which was like one of those movies that leaves you saying ""wha'"".. There are four or five threads of story woven together with one continually reading to see what happens in the end. And the climax.. the end.. nothing. One can imagine what one will but I *personally* feel that Jonathan Raban owes me another 100 pages of writing and a true conclusion to the story line and all the mini-plots. Thank goodness for libraries because if I had bought this book, I would have thrown it in the garbage in disappointment. Needless to say, I was unable to find an e-mail address for Mr. Raban. Had I done so, I could have asked him why he got writers block at the ""end"" of the book."
2,What Happened?,"If ever a book was a set-up for a sequel, this is it. Which is unfair, given that what precedes the ending is thoughtful and insightful. Other reviewers have noted the unsatisfactory ending, so I don't feel I'm giving anything away by pointing out that there really isn't any ending. Is the reader to draw their own conclusions, or is there a followup in the wings? But the reader has to feel cheated since, unlike the serial works of Dickens or Thackery, the reader is led to believe this novel is a work in its entirety. The characters are given inner lives and divergent points of view, and there is almost a sensual quality to Raban's writing. But it is as if the publisher was on the phone with an insurmountable deadline to meet, and he had to leave the ending out in order to reach it."
2,Eh,"I had to read this book for a college class. I thought it was fairly interesting, but I don't think it was well-written. It was a little hard to follow and the chapters didn't transition well. There were also quite a few loose ends that weren't tied up well and the author introduced characters that seem unimportant to the overall plot of the book.It's a two-star in my opinion, at best."
4,another view of the ending,"I always enjoy reading Jonathon Raban and this book is no exception. The ending is clearly what gets to people in the reviews. It is a very deliberate ending and clearly part of the discussion carried in the book. That it has shock value is also thought out. It is, in a way the proper denouement for the story (especially today, with part of Japan disappearing under a tidal wave). None the less, even taking those factors into account, it is somehow unsatisfying. Could it have been better crafted to be both shocking ans satisfying? I have no idea. But I will read Raban's next book."
3,It's not really a novel.,"I became interested in this after hearing Raban on a segment of Christopher Lydon's Open Source radio program. This is not, as it claims to be, a novel; it's more of a sketch of American post-9/11 paranoia in a country where everybody's watching somebody, and being watched. It's interesting, and I found myself giving it the benefit of the doubt... right up to the last couple of pages, where Raban gives us a stagey non-ending. I can't say it was a waste of time, but I am glad I got it from the library instead of buying it."
1,Huge disappointment,"What a waste of my time and money.Raban's characters are marginally likeable, at best. The narrative is relatively dull and ""surveillance"" issues play only a background role in the novel, leaving me to feel misled by his title and multiple descriptions of the plot.Truth be told, there is no plot. This is a rambling, pointless novel with an utterly meaningless ending."
2,"I LOVE READING THIS GUY, BUT. . . ???","This is my 3rd RABAN. I loved the other two.When an author writes, he is like a bus driver. He takesyou on a trip, on the roads that he wants to take you on.A left turn here, a right turn there, but, you end up wherethe """"bus driver"""" wants you to go. I never made it!!!"
1,A diluted and then truncated try at a novel.,"Reminds me of Jonathan Franzen's early Strong Motion, which is a much much better read. I regret to say that this is probably the worst book I've ever finished."
3,Get what you pay for,"The product broke after about 5 uses and the water reservoir soaked the bottom of the cigars on the first use. If you get it, don't put water in it. The seller is a good seller, though, and can't be faulted for the product."
3,Album screams - WHERE'S ISRAEL???,"This album is a Tyler Perry play without Mr. Brown!! That's as best as I can sum it. All gospel benefits the kingdom, and I'm glad I sowed my seed into their ministry, but now I have to be real. Most of us wouldn't buy this CD if we hadn't heard of Israel ""AND"" New Breed. Simply put - just look at the songs, if you're going to record a SOLO album to establish your own identity - SING NEW SONGS! %40 of the album are songs we already know and own, and do not sound nearly as good without Israel. There's no Nu Nation or Family w/out Kirk, no VOU w/out Deitrick Haddon, no RFC w/out Fred Hammond, no New Life w/out John P. Kee. Some things just ""DO"" mix!!"
5,sound machine/conair SU5T,"This machine is easy to use,very compact and lightweight. It has several features, clock, sound machine, alarm,recorder."
3,Less than expected.,"While the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra does a beautiful job in their rendition of ""Scheherazade,"" the sound quality is mediocre. The recording seems to have a distant, muted feel.NOTE TO AMAZON: COVER ART SHOWN ON WEB PAGE IS INCORRECT--I BELIEVE IT IS FOR THE SWISS ORCHESTRA"
5,One of the greatest live albums ever,"The only other live albums I know of that are this good is AC/ DC's ""If You Want Blood, You've Got It"" and ""Live Yardbirds Featuring Jimmy Page."""
3,This was an incredible recording that's gone flat on the CD,If you've ever listened to the original LP then this CD is a big disappointment; sounds like it was mastered from a worn out cassette tape.
1,May be missing a song,"For some reason there seem to be three versions of this album listed separately for sale on Amazon. One of them only has 13 tracks. Be sure to get the version with 14 tracks because the 14th track is too good to miss. ""Down the Line"" is one of the live songs and you absolutely want to have that cut. This review seems to appear in several versions of the album"
1,"Waste of Money, Waste of Resources",I tried this product out of curiosity since it was new. It tastes like all the others but with a much higher price tag. I am now at the point where I think bottled water is such a waste of money and natural resources - clogging landfills with all the bottles that no one recycles - that I am going to buy a water filter for my sink and just use that. You can also buy packets of electrolytes from companies like Emergen-C and add them to your water. I used those when I ran a marathon and they worked wonders! Save a buck and save the environment...use filtered water in a bottle you can reuse.
1,my mother's caution,"my mother warned me that if it's hot, and you wet your hair to cool off, your head risks exploding. it's true, really. i don't know if smartwater has been genetically modified to avoid this little-known health tragedy. so be careful, no matter how many bottles they include in a multi-pack."
4,Poetry and all that jazz.,"The Beat Generation is a term used to describe both a group of American writers who came to prominence in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the cultural phenomena that they wrote about and inspired (later sometimes called beatniks though this is considered by many to be a pejorative term). This box set features material by genuine beats alongside ""commercial"" recordings made to cash in on the beatnik ""fad"". The CDs include poetry, jazz, news reports and other recordings related to the beat phenomenon. It is interesting and informitive if you are curious to learn about the Beat Generation."
3,"Unique, pretty good...but with glaring omissions.","Three tracks of Del Close, but no Kenneth Rexroth?No Richard Brautigan? No William Burroughs? Okay.""Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?""Piss off."
4,Brief outline of biblical teaching on business,This was a very insight full book on the inheriant goodness of business. He attacked several misconceptions I had about business. Feeling guilty for earning a profit or being well off. What matters is how you obtain your money and what you do with it afterward. If you obtain your money through hard work and fairness in business dealings you deserve what you have. And the best way to help someone in need is through give them the power to earn their own profit.Don't expect a lot of interesting or amusing stories this is bare bones biblical explanation.
4,A great essay on the potential for business,"There is no doubt, business can be used as a tool for oppression or for the purpose of evil. But thats just the results of business in the hands of evil people. Mr Grudem make an excellent doctrinal defense for business and explores how it can be very beneficial when business is conducted with honesty and fairness."
4,thought provoking,"I have never really thought deeply on why I do business and what mindset I should have. Prior to this book, I just did and now I guess I try to look inside a bit more. I recommend it for Christians and non-Christians."
5,this ia a great cd,I purchased a similiar album years ago when Desmond first began singing. It was a great abum then and a great CD now. many of the songs relates to many of the problems in todays world. It's also a great CD to listen to. All the songs are great Many of the songs made today is full of violence. This one is not. I look forward to hearing other CD's from Desmond Deckker
3,Great Historical Document - Okay CD,"I bought this to learn a little more about Reggae's roots. While this is a vast collection of songs by ska's master, it just doesn't live up to what would follow. The arrangements are sparse and (sorry) boring, and the doo-wop delivery disappoints. It should also be said that the recording quality and overall sound quality leave a lot to be desired. This is an important CD for any collector, but probably not a great choice for a casual listener."
1,"Awful, just awful","I recently heard ""Israelites"" on a Stiff compilation and thought ""Wow, this is great. When it came out I thought it was horrible."" So we bought this CD (note the good reviews here). Yup, I was right the 1st time. The Stiff version is different; this one isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but sooooo close.The rest of the CD is even worse: it's like listening to a lounge band do ""jive"": there's no soul, no bottom, no feeling of any kind. Great elevator music. No wonder DD appealed to the masses who thought mainstream Reggae was too strong. This is the Brothers Four of Reggae.In the movie ""Head Office"" Rick Moranis says ""I know crap when I see it, and this is crap."" Don't buy this unless you thought the Kingston Trio were funky and got down."
2,Had to try it,"I dont feel bad reviews are a good thing, so all I will say is, the picture on the cover is really nice."
4,Like putting your face in a racoon trap!,"I've seen a few of the Masters of Horror films and I'm not very fond of most of them. Pelts is so far my favorite. Pelts really revives the 80s brand of horror with lots of gore, bad acting and a lot of nudity. The plot is fairly original, too. (not that the plot is that important) After catching a group of racoons to make a fur coat, the people involved start dying grizzly deaths similar to the racoons. And trust me some of those deaths are nasty. I would recommend this flick to any slasher fan out there."
2,Pelts... a little too gross,"While I love horror... Pelts in many ways was a little too ""over the top"" for my taste. I was extremely grossed out by some of the scenes. But then again my tastes leans towards the more classic horror movies and not the ""slash and guts"" genre of many of today's horror movies. I would not recommend this movie for the faint of heart ( though faint of stomache would be a better phrase)."
3,MEAT LOAF AND THE 'COONS,"This gory, somewhat perverted entry in the Masters of Horror series offers us Dario Argento's take on sexual perversion and greed. Meat Loaf Aday (reminding me of Randy Quaid) plays a furrier who has an obsession with a local stripper and offers her a beautiful coonskin coat. Only trouble is the pelts came from a haunted forest, taken by John Saxon and his son. Whoever comes in contact with the pelts becomes dangerously murderous, either to others or themselves.Argento's mastery of atmospheric tension aids this otherwise silly tale."
4,pelts,This movie was exellently done . meatloaf was a good actor . all though this film is only 59 minutes long . i had a laugh at the end of the movie with the ending.over all 4.5 stars
3,Pretty freaking gory.,"Piss poor acting and cheesy situations are overshadowed by the gore-fest on this one. The dude who removes his intestines after cutting himself open with scissors make the similar situation in ""Cigarette Burns""(Carpenter) look like Romper Room. I was also lovin when Meatloaf skinned himself. I always wanted to do that to him cuz his music sucks! Tons of cheese and yet tons of blood made me indifferent to this Masters of Horror flick. I've seen 14 of them and this one I personally rate somewhere in the middle."
4,A great MOH title...,"...I really enjoyed this one from beginning to end. Interesting story, visuals, everything. This one is about a group of pelts used to make a fur coat. Everyone involved in making the coat begins to suffer a gruesome death. This is one of the better MOH titles. Worth it."
4,if lucio fulci made a masters of horror.,"this doesnt feel like an argento film. not very stylish or visually interesting, just really gory. but thats what i like, gore, gore and more gore. if lucio fulci were still alive and he made one of these this would be the result.gore hounds will love this. bear trap face chopping, scissor disembowelment and a man cutting off his own torso skin are the highlights along with a few other twisted moments. some of the effects are a bit fake but they still make an impact. also the film doesnt make much sense, but its fun to watch. 4/5, a bllody good gore fest."
2,I HATE this scale,"I've tried Weight Watcher's before, and having good results with the program, I thought I'd have good results with this scale.I was dead wrong.This scale is such a piece of crap. I and all 3 other members of the family have tried using this scale in EVERY non-carpeted room of the house, and the scale is completely inaccurate. To give it some credit, it's usually within 5-7 pounds of your weight (but never the same number), but sometimes it can be off as much as 30 pounds. Yes, 30 pounds.You can usually have a ""general"" area of where you are weight-wise, but you will never really get an accurate weight, just a guess after getting an average of 10 numbers or so.I've had this scale for about a year, and have put it in every spot imagineable to see if the floor might be slanted or something that would alter the results. I have no luck. Do not spend your money on this scale, it's not worth it."
5,We love this book!,"This book was a present from a friend to my son who was 2 at the time my daughter was born. The children are now 5 and 3, respectively. It continues as a favorite from amongst the now hundreds of books on their shelves. Not only is this book a wonderful lesson of sharing and love (""There's always room on Mother's lap"" has become a mantra in our house), but it is also a lovely book filled with beautiful images of everyday Inuit life. I'm now buying a copy for another friend of mine who is expecting her second child."
5,Gentle and Loving!,"My daughter is 11 months old and loves this book read to her. The rythmic phrase ""back and forth"" catches her attention and helps her focus in on each scenario. I borrowed this book from the library, but now I want to purchase it! Have fun reading this book to your baby!"
3,Pretty book,"Nice book, not sure if it engages my 2-yr old. Great sentiment though....Looking for 'new baby' books geared to very young crowd. Haven't found anything super yet."
5,Good Ol' Mom,"This adorable book tells the simple story of a little boy who not only wants to be on Mother's lap (but not little brother!), he wants to pile all his favorite things on her, too. It happens to be set in an Alaskan village, and some items in the room are of interest for those children learning about Alaska. The Mother in the book is very patient and wise, and lets her boy know that ""There's always room on Mother's lap."" A very sweet and loving book."
5,Beautiful story,"I purchased this book before my 2nd child was born. My oldest child and I read this over and over. It is still a favorite. The rhythm of the prose, the pictures, the sentiment... all beautiful."
5,Outstanding performance,"The Juilliard gives a gripping performance of these magnificent quartets. The atmosphere of barely, yet perfectly controlled energy lends itself well to these pieces. The opening of the G major will have you on the edge of your seat, and the D minor avoids pathos yet expresses all of the power and drama of this work. This is the one to get."
5,Invaluable Study,"Sandra Paquet offers a detailed an informative analysis of Caribbean literature. Her study explores a range of authors and texts, focusing on the difficulties of self-definition."
3,Good book,"This is ok for a beginner on preparing a message, but I'd rather have the Holy Spirit help me. This is to written in stone for me."
5,crazy maid!,"I went in watching The Maid with no prior knowledge of what it would be about. So, for the first half of the movie, I just thought it was going to be about this crazy maid, and I had no idea where the director was going with this. However, after the introduction of Lucy, everything fell into place, and I understood where the film was going, and I highly enjoyed the whole thing.The acting and portrayals seemed very natural and fluid. Everything was believable and not exaggerated. Raquel was definitely a character worth making a movie about because her attitude was so intense, and some of her actions were a bit insane.The film was very funny, but it didn't seem like it was trying to be funny...it was more like laughing at real life events rather than something made to be laughed at.I'd highly recommend The Maid! I think most people would walk away from the movie thoroughly entertained."
2,I couldn't watch it all,"I read wonderful reviews of the movie, looked forward to seeing it for a long time...and ultimately couldn't watch it. The premise is great, the casting is great. It's a great movie. When the maid, provoked to an extreme degree, threatens to harm the family cat, I turned it off. I do not know if the threatened harm became reality or not, and I shall never know."
1,Are you kidding me!?,"I was so excited when I ordered this item for my daughter. I received it in a damaged box to boot. To not only open it and find it damaged, but a horrific product. It is simply heavy cardboard, that if it gets wet it will deteriorate and fall apart. I assume that the rest of the items of this nature are the same. Shame on them. I, honestly and without exageration, would say it is worth $5.00. The inside is even thinner cardboard. I would never buy this item for myself or anyone else. Shameful that the mark up by them or by Avenue You is so high... Anyone purchasing this should also note that you don't get your money back, you get a store credit. I suppose I should thank God it came damaged."
3,"I like it, but....","Looks great in the picture, does it not? Captures a lot of sparkle, looks like it shines from every angle...this is not the case. It's still pretty, but they paint the back with that gold and it doesn't look all too great on the other side. I'm a guy; I never knew gold could make an object look worse. And the main, non-gold ruined side doesn't look BAD, it just looks...average. If you're looking for something that looks okay, then this is the thing for you. If you want something that looks amazing, please keep looking."
3,this is not industrial fools...,"this is not a gothic industrial collection!!! this is a gothic, simphonic, doom metal collecion, don t be disapointed , thought some videos are good , u must get the goth box or gothic industrial madness"
5,"Jubilation, Vol. 1","I love the gospel songs from the old days, they put you closer to God when listening to them."
3,The ONLY truly innovative album in Hip Hop,"This is the only Hip Hop album i've heard in years that is actually inventive (and its from Chicago)! Rubberoom does a fabulous job at changing the listeners mood and toy with your mind. These sound is varied and the lyrics are clever. Thanks for renewing my faith in hip hop. I put these guys up with other underrated music acts (not necessarily hip hop) in both sound and production quality like haujobb, FLA, Talvin Singh, Forma Tadre, or Montauk P."
5,Gloomy beats with superb lyrics.,At first I wasn't sure if I should buy this album or not but I'm sure glad that I did and I can safely say that this is one of the best albums that I have heard this year. If you like underground hip-hop and you like gloomy type beats that this album is one that I highly recommend.
5,"A-Grade Underground Hip-Hop, 4.5 Stars",These cats bring thoughtful lyrics over some wacky- not wack- beats. They're unique but they pound. I play it all the way through.
4,"Rugged,raw, real HIP-HOP","All I can say about this CD is it represents what real underground hip-hop is all about. It's dark, like something to listen to on October 30 at 11:59:59. These kids can flow and they have some extremely innovative beats and background sounds. On the real, it's a different sound-something new and inventive. I felt similar when I heard Wu's first joint. I really feel track#5 ""Bleach,"" #6 ""Acid,"" #10 ""Style Wars,"" and #13 ""Vampire."" All you real headz-this is a must have!"
1,"Good features, poor design !","This product although has good feature set, but is so badly put together that i have stopped using it. I bought this for the meetings and to record my thoughts for those times when its easier to speak than write (like 3 a.m. in the morning after a 16 hr. work day) - i must say its a big put off,for the keys are so multi-functional you don't even know if you are recording on the blank side anymore. There is a lot of ""adjustment-clicks"" that this piece makes (like changing sides, reverse, forward and then at other times for God knows what event...:) ..."
1,Dirt,"The taste of this product is on par with a shovelful of dirt. I have tasted my share of crummy quality items in my time but this product may be, or is, the hands-down winner. I have been throwing it into the backyard for the squirrels and birds to eat (since I cannot consume it) and it seems to disappear so I guess this must mean they are very hungry and will eat anything in a pinch."
1,Shipping Problems,"I ordered two orders of this product and each order is a (Pack of 12, I should have received a total of 24 packs. I received the shipment and it contained only 2 packs and the invoice was marked complete. I called customer service. Customer service was very friendly and told me to keep the 2 packs and the order would be resubmitted for a full 24 packs. I received the next order and it only had 2 packs. Waste of time. Don't know who or what is handling their shipping, but is doesn't work. Amazon gift certificates are a pain in the a*s."
5,Worth it,This was a great story! Just as good as the first. Can't wait to read the next!PS. I was totally shocked at the end:)
4,Why readers love NYC,"When I was just a girl I read Brighton Beach Memoirs and was ready to pack my bags. Matetsky brings fifties Manhattan to life in the same way.Murder is a Girl's Best Friend is a charming second novel and illustrates a growing depth to Paige and Matetsky's writing.I gave this book a four instead of a five because it still feels too formulaic and similar to the first book. Paige seems a little too similar to Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone. Although the character description is strong, the relationships seem slightly forced."
5,SO MUCH FUN TO READ!,"I have always loved a good mystery and have read many. ""Murder Is a Girl's Best Friend"" satisfies all of my mystery cravings, but also give so much more. It's just plain fun to read! Very well written, the characters are fully portrayed and the humor of the main character and some of the other characters is woven throughout the entire manuscript. For entertainment value, you can't beat this book. It's also great for an ex-New Yorker (me) to read about NYC in the 50's. Lots of old memories came flooding back. I highly recommend this book. Great value for the price!"
4,Michael Tillson Thomas scores,"I have had this disk over 15 years, and enjoy it as much now as the first time I listened to it. The 3rd symphony is well done, the contredanses after are a delight, and the performance is crisp and clean."
1,not sure what to make of this one,"As a motorcyclist and adventure tourer, I had hopes for this book. I find it poorly written, tedious, unfocused. What to call it? It's not detailed enough to be travel writing, not deep enough for journal writing, not engaging in the least. The people and places are two dimensional and boring, and even the author's attempts to describe 'living hell"" come across as ""living heck."" I find myself not caring what happens to the author and his traveling companion, nor would I want to visit any of the places that he describes, though I'm willing to believe that they could actually be interesting outside of the author's stewardship.There are many good motorcycle adventure books (The Long Journey Home, Ten Years On Two Wheels, Chasing Che) to be had. This is not one of them."
3,bad relationship,This is more a story about a relationship that has gone bad than it is a travel story or a story about motorcycles.
2,33 Missing Pages,"Highly detailed first person narratives and a good ""thread"" make this a promising book, although overdone with the similes. At times there are so many similes, one after the other, that they bring attention to themselves instead of the images intended by the author.Most unfortunately, however, are the 33 pages missing in mid stream. From page 148, there are 16 pages numbered from 117 to 148, which I'd already read, then it jumps to page 181. At that point I quit.But I'll look for Noren's next book. (Find another publisher)"
3,Definitely need to break them in...,"Just got these shoes yesterday and theyre a bit stiff. Also theyre pretty narrow so if you have wider feet, id recommend getting the ones with the narrower strap. They are cute though so I'll keep them and break them in...but I dont think theyre worth the price."
2,Not like the San Clemente classics!,"I've been buying and wearing Rainbows since the early 80s -- when Rainbows used to sell at the O.C. Swapmeet, that's how far back I go. I live in these things. However, the new ones I mail ordered are really not like the originals. First they don't have the arch support the old ones had and the three different pairs I ordered from Island, though marked Ladies 11, were more like a men's size 11 and not as stylish as the old ones. I'm going to have to go to Rainbows' outlet in San Clemente to see whether the old style are still available. Very disappointed."
4,Good Book,I very much enjoyed this book. It was a easy read and a well paced novel. I also thought that this could very easily be turned into either a movie or made for T.V. movie. I would recommend this book to all readers.
5,Great for steel and stays sharp.,"These bits are solid cobalt, so they stay sharp for a long time. And when you do need to sharpen them, it's still cobalt underneath, unlike a cobalt coated bit. They work great for wood and metal, and I even used them to drill through 1/2"" steel without any issues.The only issue is that, like any drill bit, they will break if abused. Unfortunately, I have an 18v Dewalt drill with a lot of torque, so I snapped the bit when it locked up from my abuse. However, it was a fairly small 7/32 bit. On the bright side, I used a drill doctor to sharpen the remaining bit and it still works.Overall, this is a very solid drill bit set, and I doubt I will need any more for a while as long as I don't do anything stupid again."
4,Good book - great recipes! Could use some proofreading.,"Well written book, organized in a very usable style, I love the recipes and ""margin tips"" included by the author. Both this book and Dick's later book ""Dutch Oven Entertaining"" have some glaring (sometimes entertaining) typos that distract a little from a great work. They're both still well worth the price!"
4,Good Value,These birds are a good value for the price - especially if you buy enough for free shipping. After steaming refrigerate and they hold up well for club play.
2,internet food is scary,"Under the title "" you get what you pay for"". The apricots are poor quality. They are probably the smallest with the most inedible peices that I have ever had. The are easily the least expensive. I have forced my self to consume about half a bag. They taste like apricots but they are tough, dry, small, and have black oxydized spots on some peices. At the price I paid I don't mind throwing out the peices that are questionable. Bottom Line - I would not buy them again"
5,Nice product,The apricotts look fresh and tast good. Their sizes look no different from those bought in a grocery store. I especially like they're packed in 12 individual zipper bags. My son loves them!
4,Many beans are too oily,"I agree with many of the reviews that this is generally a good coffee maker that has problems with oily beans. What did surprise me after purchasing this coffee maker is how many different beans are too oily. Several types of beans have become stuck in the grinder and require manual intervention to grind. This is not the end of the world, but for $300, I would like to be able to use the automatic timer. Packing the beans in tightly does seem to help somewhat."
5,Wonderful Coffeemaker,"I read the reviews about this coffeemaker and was a little hesitant about buying it. I owned the 451 coffee team and really like it. I bought a cusinart therm coffee maker and was very disappointed in it. I have found this 455 coffeeTeam therm to do all that it says it will do. I have had no difficulty in programming or using this machine. It makes wonderful coffewhether you like it weak, medium, or strong. I prefer medium. I can hardly believe how hot the therm keeps the coffee, even after two hours. The coffee is steaming. I am really impressed with this coffee maker."
5,As Fabulous as I'd Dreamed!,"I've been hounding my husband for about two years now for the Capresso grind and brew with the glass carafe because the thermal was a bit too much for us to pay for a coffee maker. The problem was he balked at the cost of that one too. Imagine my surprise when my mom and stepdad gifted us with this one today!I came home after dinner and immediately set it up. It took a little fiddling, but eventually we figured it out (we're not direction readers!). I am in love! This thing is wonderful. What a beautiful machine and it makes an incredible cup of coffee. It's just as hot as my Cuisinart was on its highest setting and the thermal carafe does a magnificent job keeping the coffee hot and fresh. I highly recommend it!"
1,very disappointing,"I returned the capresso because pete's coffee beans were too ""oily."" Although the burr grinder grounds were very nice, the feeder channel would get clogged, even after cleaning it thoroughly."
1,I hate this coffeemaker,"This machine's design flaws and poor construction make it horribly frustrating to use. The lid that goes over the filter cup is made of plastic which warped after one spin through the dishwasher, so now the filter cup doesn't swing freely. I had to wait until the grind cycle was complete and ""assist"" the basket when it swung into the brew position. So much for an automatic coffeemaker! I have to pull the machine far forward on my countertop because the lid to the water reservoir lifts up so high. Controls are on the side so that requires turning it sideways to program that day's brew. Programming is done by twisting a knob; wonder how long before that and the mechanism that swings the filter basket from side to side breaks? I'm not waiting to find out; I'm replacing this with the Cuisinart DGB-900BC."
2,Just Returned Ours...,"We love our coffee - borderline religious. We had owned the old Capresso (without the thermal cafe). After 5 years the grinder on the old Capresso stopped working so we happily paid $300 to upgrade to the CoffeeTEAM Thermal. In the two weeks that we owned it we experienced the same flaws that you'll read about from other reviewers - weak coffee, the filter wouldn't swing to the closed position, grinder would spew coffee all over the countertop. We purchased it locally and when we returned it the customer service person told us that she had received a ton of similar complaints. GREAT concept. We'd even give Capresso another try if they made an atempt to fix the poor workmanship but for $300 I want my coffee the way I like it, when I want it and the Capresso didn't deliver."
5,Great Coffeemaker,This is a great coffeemaker. It's nice to wake up to the smell of coffee brewed to perfection. It's very attractive and is shaped to fit in the corner.
1,Not Hot!,"I bought this coffee maker as a Christmas gift...I discovered that it shuts off immediately after the coffee has completed it's brewing cycle. The plate that the carafe sits on does not heat at all. The carafe keeps warm what has been moderately warmed in the brewing process. It is lukewarm at best. If you like hot coffee, this is a huge disappointment--too, the coffee has a metallic taste (I believe from the carafe). The original Capresso with the glass carafe is a much better purchase."
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,"I am a snob when it comes to coffee makers and coffee beans. I have used grind and brew coffee makers for years and when I saw this one I just had to have it. To me, it is a huge disappointment and a waste of money. It's contrary, hard to set and hard to put back together after you clean it. You practically need a college degree to operate this one. Obviously, the designer of this coffee pot does not make coffee on a daily basis."
1,capresso coffe maker and grinder,I bought a capresso maker and grinder several years ago. It makes weak coffee unless I run the gringer 3 times takes about 15 minutes to make a pot. I will replace with another brand. This product is over priced and not up to expectations.
1,Seattle Coffee Coffee Gear is horrible to do business with!,"Between Seattle Coffee Gear and Amazon and I don't know which is worse. Either way,I wouldn't do business with either company again!"
1,Capresso 455 Coffee TEAM Therm DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Paid $230 for this and after 2.5 yers had to send it back with a charge of $85.00 for them to fix the display that went bad. Now 2.5 years later the grinder is not grinding the correct amount of beans for the number of cups programmed. It was weak (even on strong) to begin with. Now it's like colored water. Their customer service told me to change the grind from fine to corse. Exactly how does that fix the AMOUNT of coffee being ground? They told me to pay ANOTHER $85.00 to send it back for them to fix. Good luck with that. I'll pitch it in the garbage and start investigating other brands.
2,Love Hate,"I really liked this coffee maker when I first purchased it. Got it at TJ Maxx for about $189. I love the burr grinder and the coffee is delicious using different kinds of beans, from light to dark roast. But, after about 6 months of use, the LCD screen started to fade. It is now to the point where I cannot use the automatic grind/brew feature, because the LCD screen is completely unreadable. I now use the ""Grinding Now"" function to make coffee on demand. Very disappointing, considering I've only had this coffee maker for under two years. I cannot recommend this coffee maker."
2,troubles galore,"We purchased this unit a month ago. We've had a few good pots of coffee, and a few not so good....when it works! Our first unit was completely defective and promptly replaced. Our second worked for a couple weeks before the grinder stopped working. We do not like the thermos lid, which is hard to open and close. The drip mechanism sometimes gets clogged, causing coffee to leak on the countertop. 3 stikes and it is out of here."
3,A messy machine,"The machine brews great coffee, is simple to use and program. However, I have to clean up a small amount of coffee grinds every day that get sprayed over the wall, splashblock and countertop to the left and rear of the machine. Since I have stuff on the counter near the machine, they have to be cleaned every day. The grinds seem to be broadcast from the spout of the grinder while the machine is grinding and dispensing the coffee, and before the basket swings over to brew. So far I have tried the machine with and without the optional basket cover, with no discernable difference in mess. This is a shame, because otherwise this very expensive coffee maker is pretty nice."
2,not worth the $,"The coffee is so weak that we have to add a scoop of pre-ground coffee to the pot the night before to make it drinkable, which kind of defeats the purpose of ""fresh ground coffee"". I would love to return this pot, but my husband doesn't like to return anything. My $5 Goodwill Krups coffeepot that I have used for 5 years certainly outshines this one..."
1,Don't order this,I should have listened to the negative feedback. Made a great cup of coffee first time - and only time.
3,Quality of workmanship?,"We received this coffee maker just after Thanksgiving, and actually really enjoy the features offered. The biggest disappointment was when the ""thermos"" started leaking from the area between the black plastic handle piece & the metal thermos...after fewer than 5 pots of coffee! The entire black section was not sealed well, and actually started coming apart from the rest of the unit! Customer service was helpful, but questioned whether or not I had submerged the pot in water, as that seems to cause the problem, which I hadn't done. So, this indicates to me, that I'm definitely not the first to complain about the issue, and that for a $300 unit, ""they"" should be making the required improvements to keep this from happening. I have to pay for shipping, and prepay $60 for the new thermos to get shipped to me, but they'll be including a free shipping label to use when sending the broken one back. Once they receive it, they'll reimburse me the $60...fair enough."
5,"Great Machine, Great Coffee",We have had this coffee maker for a couple of weeks and our whole family loves it. I have college-aged children who are all home for the summer and we are up in the morning at different times. Every cup of coffee is totally perfect (it took us a couple of days to get the right grind for our favorite beans) and the thermal cup keeps the coffee hot and fresh for hours. I feel like I've waited for years to get fresh ground coffee this good at home.
4,World Class Coffee!,"This is a terrific product, and performs as described. The only problem I've had is when I am grinding dark, oily beans. They tend to stick together and not feed into the grinder without manual assistance. Otherwise, it brews a wonderful cup of coffee and it stays warm all day in the carafe. It is definitely worth the extra cost over Cuisinart Grind n' Brew."
1,Poorly designed,"The unit worked well for about 2 weeks and then the valve which regulates the flow of cofee into the carafe began to stick,spewing coffee over the counter top. Attempts at cleaning the top corrected the situation for only one or two brewings. The coffee itself tends to be on the weak side. The rubber gasket supplied for the top of the carafe does not fit. All in all, an expensive and poorly designed product."
1,A $300 disappointment!,"I was so excited to get this coffee maker. I had one just like it, except for the thermal carafe, for many years and it was terrific. The coffee this makes is weak! I don't require exceptionally strong coffee, but this is like tinted water. I have the flavor set to strong. When I talked to customer service, they told me to ""trick"" it into making stronger coffee; set it for 10 C. ""strong"" and then flip the basket back over again and reset it for 4 C. ""strong"". This is not only a serious bother each time I brew a pot, but it makes it completely impossible to use the ""timer"" function. The other problem is that the basket does not flip back by itself, even if I don't use their ""trick."" I have to stand there and manually release the basket each time I brew a pot of coffee. I am so diappointed, I have thought about just throwing this junk in the trash!"
5,Best available grind and brew,"I recently purchased the new Capresso grind and brew to replace the older model which I have had for about 7 years. Yes, I have read reviews that contained negative comments, however I believe most of the problems expressed are actually human operator problems. Yes, you do have to put the filter basket in correctly and you do have use a course grind if you use oily beans so the grinder channel does not get clogged. It works great for me and I love it."
1,THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN THE ITEM WAS THE VENDOR JL HUFFORD,"I BOUGHT A ""REFURBISHED"" CAPRESSO COFFEE MAKER FROM JL HUFFORD AND WHEN I RECIEVED IT IT WORKED, BUT YOU HAD TO UNPLUG IT BETWEEN USES FOR IT TO WORK AGAIN. I SENT IT BACK FOR AN EXCHANGE, AND THEY SAID IT WORKED FINE AND CHARGED ME $25 FOR SHIPPING TO ME AND BACK. STAY AWAY FROM JL HUFFORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They also claim to have an unconditional 30 day money back return policy which is TOTALLY NOT TRUE. These people obviously only care about the 1st sale and are not in business for repeat customers. If you want a truly great brand like those sold at jl hufford, I would strongly suggest that you go through another dealer. I even plainly told them what the problem was when I emailed, and they just ignored what I had to say. I wish I had just paid the extra for a new unit through a decent retailer to start with rather than having to go through the irritation of dealing with these rude people."
1,Capresso 455 coffee maker,"Capresso 455 CoffeeTEAM Therm Stainless Coffeemaker/Burr Grinder CombinationWe purchased this coffee maker and have had problems with it since the beginning. The plastic coffee part broke right away. Then when we set the timer, it never worked correctly. Then, once we poured the water in the container overnight to use the timer,....it would leak all over the counter. Could only utilize the coffee maker, and make the coffee right when you want it to brew. Then, the coffee maker just went DEAD....stopped working altogether. I called customer service who was less than helpful. They wanted $85 to fix the machine.....half of the cost to purchase a new one. Even with all the problems this machine has had from the beginning, customer service (Rob) wasn't willing to work with me. I mentioned that I would then write up a review....and was told ""go for it""."
4,Best coffee maker yet!,Have owned this machine going on two years. Day in day out. A lot of coffee. The wife and I drink a pot each morning. No problems with this machine (a few coffee grounds get to the counter due to the not perfect sealing 'removable soft collar' on the cover lid for the grounds filter basket-but very small inconvenience considering the quality of coffee that comes out. Love the insulated carafe to take to the table and leave there. Has kept the coffee hot for two hours this way. This machine replaced a Cuisinart Grind and Brew. The Capresso just a couple parts to clean and outside of the routine descaling- just no maintenance!
3,ok machine,"The coffee maker is very tall and did not clear my cupboard. As with other reviews you need to adust the settings to one or two higher than you prefer to get the strength desired. It brews a good cup of coffee when you do this, but limits how many cups of coffee you can make at one time. The other feature that is cumbersome is that it is difficult to read the water level without turning the machine so I use a measuring cup to add the water. My product was re-furbished and mechanically it works fine. If you don't mind the above inconveniences, I would consider the purchase good."
5,The Best,"Having used this product for over a year, it has performed flawlessly. My previouscoffee maker was a more expensive and complicated Saeco. When the Saeco clogged it wasa total mess to clean up, whereas the Capresso is simplicity itself and has neverclogged.Using the previous reviews I purchased the larger hopper and the washers and waseducated that using paper coffee filters removed cholesterol from the brew.Filling the water level to six cups and setting the dial for 10 cups strong brewsthe perfect cup!"
4,"Most ""relieving"" gel pads, expensive","These gel pads are what the lactation consultant gave me in the hospital and they provided me with much needed relief and comfort. When I got home from the hospital, I wanted to buy some more, but they were kinda pricey. So, I tried different brands (medela, lansinoh, playtex) and I had to go back to Ameda. They were expensive, but really worked the best.After using them, my nipples felt physically better. They truly are medicated! Other pads just feel good when you put them on, but really don't make your nipples any less sore. These pads do!I recommend putting them in the fridge before applying them to your nipples. Sounds uncomfortable, but when your nipples are pink, cracked, or sore the coldness really feels good."
5,Save Your Nipples with These,"A lactation consultant gave me a pair of these at the hospital and they helped heal my sore, dry, and cracked nipples. They have a gel that helps heal and they also keep your nipples from rubbing on your clothing. I can't say enough good things about this product and it's totally worth the money (think of what you would be spending on formula if you weren't breast feeding)."
2,Too expensive for the same product you can get elsewhere,"These are not much different that Soothies (by Playtex?) and the cost a lot more ($25 for these vs. $15 for the pair of Soothies). They are nice and feel good, but Soothies are more cost-effective. I also like that the Soothies have fabric on one side so you know which side goes on the nipple. These gel pads are sticky on both sides and when I take them out to nurse, they always stick to whatever I set them on."
3,"They are good, but I don't get the hype","These were recommended to me by several people, claiming that they were a necessity for comfort when it came to breastfeeding for the first time. Honestly, I can say they were okay. I wore them a few times and they did seem to provide some comfort, but they can only be worn so many times, and they are expensive for something that just gets thrown away. I expected them to be a little different. I'm not sure how. Maybe squisher or thicker, or more concave. I, personally, had better luck with nipple creams for relief, but I won't doubt that other people have had very good experiences with these. They were nice to have, but weren't necessarily a ""must have"" for me."
5,Perfect! She says....,"This product was recommended by the Nurses at the hospital where we got a free sample. My girlfriend was extremely impressed by the results. The first day of breastfeeding she was already feeling pain and sore nipples. After using these pads for just 1 day, no more pain and nipples went back to normal. This is her 2nd baby and she's really sorry she did not get these with the first. According to her comments, I would strongly recommend these pads to any breastfeeding mom...Besides, Amazon is where I got them cheaper! However, I was hesitant to buy them at first because the main picture does not correspond to the actual product."
2,6 Uses Only!,This product was not clearly specified being this is not a cooling comfort gel you can use and use over and over again. Only 6 uses per set of pad. I just think this should be made more clearly online so the next person who purchases this item does not get fooled in thinking that this is a pad they can always re-use.
3,Better things out there,"The lactation consultants at the hospital raved about these, but I didn't find them that great. They feel great cold, but that wears off in 15 seconds and they can't be cleaned so they get grimy quickly. If you drop them on the floor and have the wash them off it shortens their life. I preferred the hard shells that are available from most brands that support breastfeeding. They are hard plastic covers that allow air to circulate around your nipples, which is key to them healing quickly. Also, the hard shells keep fabric or breast pads from rubbing against your nipples. Personally, though they felt good, I didn't feel like they expedited healing."
1,not impressed,"My nipples are in a lot of pain 6 weeks post partum. I am having to pump since my baby won't latch and am discovering that my nipples are very sensitive. I was hoping to find some relief from these gel pads, but they do not. A waste of money."
4,"Great product, but not much different from alternatives","Hydrogel is becoming more of a necessity for breastfeeding mothers. Ameda's version is good, but I dont see much difference from lower prices or bulk products. It's refrigerates/freezes and lasts. They really helped my wife get through some painful days and I would easily recommend them."
3,So-so,I didn't find these pads very comforting when I started nursing. They were quite difficult to use and didn't last long.
4,This is Great.,If you nont have any Bags music then this is the one to buy. Its a great C.D. and this is worth the price.
1,rip off,this is a great cd but if you want to buy it don't pay 99$ for it buy it new from cd baby or stanton park records for 10$and if you are retarded enough to buy it for this price than don't complain about it
2,Much Too Dark,"While I adore many of Ranney's books (esp. Tapestry, After the Kiss), this one is waaaaaay too depressing overall. Multiple graphic rapes, sodomy, starvation completely overpower the beauty of the otherwise well-developed love story between the main characters. I just finished it - but I wish I hadn't."
4,Unexpected,"This one was a little more crazy than others. It makes you remember good and evil, and that you can persevere through most anything. Love helps to struggle through all life's trials!"
1,NOT EVEN WORTH A 1 STAR - PORNOGRAPHY AT LEAST!,"I have read two of Karen Ranney books, the first ""Upon a Wicked Time"" was a fun Regency historical romance and totally enjoyable, the second ""Tapestry"" was a very deep and sometimes dark Regency historical romance, but in the end it was worth the dark feelings you had to go through to get to the end.This book ""A Promise of Love"" is so perverse that I could not get past the first Chapter.It should be rated as pornography. It contains everything from gang rape to much worse. Beware if you think this is a love story set in the Scottish Highlands. It is to offensive to read and not worth being published.I am really surprised that it was written by Karen Ranney. I will never read another book of hers again.Amazon should list it under X-Rated Pronographic."
1,Awful!,"This is the only book that I could not finish. Up until this one I'd read every single page of a book, even if it wasn't very good, in hopes that it'd get better. By the time I got to page 88, which is when I slammed it shut, I'd read about three rapes. I was so sickened that I dare not read another chapter."
5,BEST ONE OUT THERE FOR UNDER 1K,"Just got my DC9 and was amazed. Apart from getting it and a UV filter, 5 60min tapes, leather case and 32mb stick- all for under 1K, it's a great LITTLE camcorder. Easy to switch between modes, all done wih one hand. If held properly (best way, IMO: 1st finger on zoom, 2nd and 3rd around the front body, 4th around the pull-down stick (on grip) and thumb near the record button). Very easy to use the LCD and definitely get the NP-FM50 (180 min at full charge)."
5,Just Like Being There,"I hike RMNP every year and I cannot think of a more informative DVD about this park. Perfect combination of park info, regs, trails, overlooks and scenery. Even though I've been there I still enjoy watching this DVD...often."
4,Excellent product.,This timer was exactly what we needed to control the use of our bathroom heater. It's preset to 30 and 60 minutes and can easily be adjusted up or down from these times. The only thing that needs to be improved would be more specific wiring instructions.
5,Advice can't be beat!,"I bought this book years ago when my daughters were headed for teenager-hood. The author's valuable, sane advice has stayed with me throughout the years and I have recommended this book to innumerable friends! In my humble opinion, this book should be REQUIRED reading for any parent who has or will have a teenager in the house. Written from a Christian perspective, the advice given is so straightforward and sensible, it is invaluable. If you hope to preserve a good relationship with that sweet child who is now stepping into the world of teenagers, GET THIS BOOK!"
5,This is where it all started folks!,"A wonderful collection from possibly one of the best guitarists there has ever been. Alot of older stuff, so the quality on CD is a bit less than sharp. But, that is what it was back then! A must have. This man should be on the finger tips of every blues guitarist..."
3,Cute but narrow.,I tried this on and knew right away these would kill my feet & cause them to swell up if I wore them for long. narrow at top. very cute though!
4,Great book but missing a few things.,"I bought this and volume 2 expecting it to be like most trades and just reprint the full comics in order. To my surprise they are actually broken down by characters and bits that he did. Which works out great as well, but for some reason there are not Eltingville Club pieces. With these guys being in a majority of the individual titles it was disappointing not to see any of their adventures in either book. But outside of that I can highly recommend both collections."
5,Greatness in Panel form,"Evan dorkin is a genius, in my opinion. He creates strips that are bitingly funny with an underlying hint of Black Comedy. ""Murder Family"" is so sick it's good, ""Fisher Price Theater"" is sheer genius, and his collections of three-panel strips are simply hilarious. Check out ""Phil the disco skinhead"", "" Myron the living Voodoo doll"", ""God: Private investigator"" and ""Kool-aid man in Rwanda"". All great. He's a rare breed of comic book creator: one who can mock his own profession. Also, he knows when to make people think, as seen in his ""Sad fact of life"" strip( R.I.P, Jack Kirby ). I give this book the highest possible reccomendation. Buy it now, I say."
5,Gaston Goes to Mardi Gras,"This book was quite fun as Gaston appears on every ""spread"". Finding Gaston was a great addition to the BASIC story. if you know nothing about Mardi Gras- this is NOT the book for you. The pictures are fun to view but do not present crisp clear images easily recognizable. Nor does the narrative do much to further explain this wonderfuly historic tradition. Nonetheless, I used this as an aid to explaining Mardi gras to a group of 1st graders. It was a hit. As a supplement used in conjunction with other items it was great!"
3,Cute,The book is cute. I used it for a Children's Mardis Gras themed table at a party. It made a good display. I also read it to the kids a few times and they enjoyed.
4,Gaston Goes to Mardi Gras Coloring Book,"Exact copy of the book. Unfortunately, the pages are a little more complicated to color that I had hoped. Perhaps for 8-9 year olds, not 5-6 yr olds as I was hoping."
4,good folk,"This collection depends on ones perspective of folk. This cd mostly focuses on the large joyous sounds of groups such as New Christy Minstrels. A lot of people ridiculed this sound saying it wasn't true folk but I like it. This cd introduced me to groups I didn't even know existed like The Big Three, the group Mama Cass belonged to before the Mamas and the Papas. Also on this cd is the one hit wonder group Rooftop Singers' catchy ""Walk Right In"" and Even Dozen Jug Band's irritating but lovable ""Take your Fingers Off It.""The only inclusion that is questionable is Gotta Travel On by Au Go Go Singers, as that group is only remembered now for Stephen Stills involvement. But still it fits well in the middle of the mix."
2,Can't agree with the other reviewers!,"This book was so repetitive of all the formula romance plots, I just found it boring & plodded my way through it. I like Jane Porter's writing but the plot was just so typical-formula-romance, no surprises here, no suspense & not sensual enough. Blah, humbug."
5,LOL!,"This book is a funny yet serious look at the history of alcohol in Protestant Christianity. It is very enlightening and shares a lot of history and scripture about alcohol.In all of that, it still manages to be very tounge-in-cheek. It almost had me rolling on the floor a couple of times.This book proves, that contrary to what Prohobitionists might like to tell you, godly men of ages past enjoyed fermented beverages in moderation. It will make you want to abstain from alcohol in moderation."
1,Not good. Not good at all.,"I have read much of this book and had a stretching session with the author. Please stay awayfrom this man and his ramblings. His is not a clinic; it's a cult. He is a raging narcissist,and if you don't immediately buy into his healing powers, he quickly turns on you,becomes condescending and arrogant, and accuses you of not having ""body awareness.""The best thing I can say is that his stretching techniques are probably harmless, like mostother techniques. But don't believe his claims of other benefits, like curing appendicitis, withoutscientific evidence (which you won't find in the book because in person he freely boasts about hisdisdain for science)."
2,Good Stretches,"The author comes across as a total fruitcake. You can basically skip all the chapters except for the the ones that show you how to stretch. If you can get past all the spiritual junk, most of the stretches are actually pretty useful."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I am 7 months pregants and I've been experiencing all the joyful discomfort that comes with being pregnant. A few of the stretching techniques reported in the book have helped me tremendously. My back is no longer aching 24/7, energy level is much improved, but more importantly I am sleeping much better. I strongly recommend this book to pregnant women."
2,Nothing New,"I read the book and found nothing new in this book that you wouldn't find in the book Accu-Yoga by Michael Reed Gach which came out in the late 70's or early 80's. Accu-Yoga broke down the effects of Yoga on the physical body and the meridians which are expounded in the TCM system. A lot of the exercises in Mr. Cooley's book are straight from Hatha yoga, although from what I understand the way Hatha yoga is taught today is much more physical, and outward than in the time I came to yoga. Most yoga asanas[poses, postures], naturally have the stretch and resistance aspect built in to them, if you practice them in an concious way. Paying attention to the breath and the inner movement of the body, is the way that I thought yoga was suppose to be. Nothing New!"
5,Genius of Flexibility,Excellent book for people who stretch already and need to try something a bit different.
3,Caution,I wanted a book on flexibility and stretching to help with my water exercise and thought I could translate some of these to my exercise routine.I thought I had warmed up enough and attempted one of the most basic stretches recommended (that everyone should do) and ended up triggering my scitica instantly by the stretch. I had trouble finishing my exercise and bearing weight initially but was ok by the next day just having the suffer the after-effects from triggering the scitica plus missing two days of exercising in recovering.I reviewed this basic stretch to see if I missed any warnings or caution but there was none.So I have put away this book for the time still sore from my first and last experience with this author's stretching and flexibility advise. Right now its just too dangerous to try again.
5,A ne way to regain Flexibility,"What a great book. This system really works to increase flexibility I thought I had lost. I am more flexibile now in my 50's after doing this resistance stretching method, than I was in my 30's. The book is easy to follow, the pictures are excellent and it is very easy to do a home program and get incredible results. I have practiced yoga for years and yet this resistance stretching has helped my back and shoulders to become more flexible in ways that yoga did not. I highly recommend this book to everyone young and old, athletes and non-athletes, recovering from injury or just feeling stiff. Thank you, Mr. Cooley for your work."
4,"Good book, a little too granola on the explanation though","Provides a nice variety of stretches.Cons:1. Black and white and lack of 3D on the direction of stretch and resistance makes it difficult to discern which way you are supposed to be resisting.2. No explanation or details on which body part is the focus of the stretch. Some are fairly obvious but some stretches hit various parts of the body and there's nothing identifying these parts.3. Benefits write up - too granola. The Psychological benefits are a bit hokey for me. ""This stretch can assist you in dismatling indifference and move you away from a feeling of martyrdom"".... uhhhh, sorry, i don't think i'll be getting that from this stretch..4. p 255 which lists the stretch to the body part... doesn't say which series it is referring to. there are 3 series of stretches. Some of the cited stretches don't seem to correspond to the body part identified.I like the book... it could have been way better if not for the above items"
1,Bizarre!!!,"This stretching stuff probably works. But after reading only a chapter or so, it was sooo weird, I refused to participate in this dude's madness! Never, in all of my 57 years have I read such craziness!"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"Very jumbled, pseudoscientific and not for beginners. I couldn't even do the beginners first stretch because you have to be flexible to do it! Also the instructions were hard to read and follow. You can't go wrong if you buy Anderson's Stretching."
1,Hippie science is not science,"I bought this book because I was looking for a good sports-medicine guide to stretching....I was very disappointed after reading only a few pages. The author apparently believes stretching is the cure for all of life's aliments - physically, spiritually, and psychologically. On page 8 the author claims that ""I used those stretches to heal my appendix."" That statement should be enough reason, for any person with a sliver of intellect or respect for science and medicine, to stay far away for this book. This book may sell well in San Francisco or Vermont, but for all others, I do not recommend it.As a public service announcement: If any one is having problems with their appendix, please go straight to the emergency room. Do not waste any time touching your toes, standing on your head, or gazing into crystals. If your appendix burst you will be in a lot of pain, and could possible die."
2,Not for me,"I'm sorry to give a negative review, but this book has exercises that are only for folks who are young enough to try new stuff. The exercises are difficult to say the least, so it is not a book for the beginner. Besides, it is connected with health problems and assets which make it even more confusing."
2,The Genius of Flexability,"There is too much fluff in this book.I agree with most of the other ""low"" rated reviews. I have had this book for well over a year now, and I still do not like it. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one, is because it did show me how to do one stretch I have never seen before."
4,Pretty good. I dig 'em.,"I bought 3 of these for my Jeep Liberty ""jogger"" stroller. =P I had to bend the plastic frame on the front of the stroller to get the tire to not scrape and get stuck when I turned. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Everything else is fine. I've ran over glass a few times with these and they haven't started leaking yet! (Glass shards was the cause of my last flat.) The tread depth is nicer (deeper) than the old tires I had. The side walls were the tiniest bit longer and quite rigid. I had a lot of trouble getting these on but I'm sure it won't be a problem if you DON'T have arthritis. lol."
3,Alright if it's not going on a key chain,"I put this punch on my key chain as soon as I got it. I was able to use it 2 times before I looked down and realized that the cap fell off. It it would have come with a rubber washer it may have been better. In a nut shell, ok punch, Bad keychain."
1,STILL as HORRIBLE as prior Christmas,"Is the business ""model"" here hoping to snare new suckers every year? Perhaps people cannot be bothered to return junk when duped? This is amazon and not a flea market."
2,cigar punch review,Punch worked well about 3 times then center pin fell out . I put pin back in . Working ok for now.
2,bullet punch,"I was very displeased when i opened up the package to examine the punch. the overall body looked good. but when i examined punch itself on the inside it was bent i many areas and not chamfered very good and when looked at was crooked. and a small part of it looked burnt. it was my understanding it was new, apparently not."
1,Cute but not what I wanted,"I received cute note cards in the mail, when I thought I was getting a cook book on desserts. I was not happy!"
2,Stationary Cards - Not Recipe Cards,"I too read the reviews and saw note cards, but thought recipe cards - cards that had recipe on them that you could use in the kitchen. Iwas wrong - these are stationary cards - with envelopes. The pictures are mouth watering - but should not be listed with books or recipes."
1,NO recipes on these note cards,"I should have read the reviews... but, really... note cards from Ina Garten SHOULD have a recipe on them... after all... she is a COOK and NOT a PHOTOGRAPHER!"
3,a tight squeeze,"I am 7 and got 7.5, but it hurts my toes. nice quality shoes though, so I haven't decided if to return for a larger size of suffer with the discomort"
5,"Sexy, High Style, Sling Back","I ordered these shoes although I was a little worried because I had read a review which said they were a ""tight fit."" However, I ordered my normal size, a 9, and they fit perfectly. I am complimented whenever I wear these shoes. What I especially love is the ""no slip"" feature which keeps your feet inside the shoe so it does not slip forward like some slingbacks tend to do. You can't go wrong purchasing these shoes. They are definitely comfortable, sexy and stylish!"
3,Defective,My son received this as a gift. We were really excited to give it a try - to no avail. It never worked! The remote control did not control a thing. The sailer just sat on the asphalt with the sail flapping in the wind. No movement whatsoever. Very disappointing especially after an unsuccessful quest to find a replacement.
4,books on tape listener,"When I take my dogs for a walk I listen to books on tape so I ordered this personal cassette player because it said auto reverse. It is very light, easy to use and good sound, but not auto reverse."
4,Good player BUT....,"Great player for the price, but it has definitely not the auto reverse option, which by the way attracted me to purchase it. So don't be fooled :)"
2,Great in theory..,"When we first installed them, they worked great. Installation was a breeze and everything was wired in throughout the house within an hour. However, after 3-4 months they randomly started cutting in and out on the sound levels. One of the units started making a popping and crackling sound so I had to replace it. I'm actually looking for a replacement solution now."
1,canceled order...no excuse,"I ordered this a few weeks ago, order went through, item described as in-stock. a few days later they cancel my order and give no excuse or anything. The order doesn't even show up in my amazon order history. Great service when they just wipe an order away as if it never happened. Don't risk it buying from these guys, you're just wasting your time."
3,Could be better,"Most of the book's entries is about the history of the various locations, and how to get there. There is very little about the trails themsleves, what to expect, or even level of difficulty. This is a serious flaw."
5,HILARIOUS,this is one of the funniest movies i've seen. i'm thrilled it's finally on dvd! i couldn't recommend this more.
3,Good if you know what your doing,If your looking for answers on action script and how to easily implement it to flash this is not the book for you. This book gives a good explanation of coding and goes through all forms and ways of coding. I have only made it partially through the book but until i get much further i feel i will just stay confused.
4,ActionScript Bible,"The book is VERY technical, and puts good use to people who are familiar with technical literature. However, it's examples are poor, so don't expect this book to give you a step-by-step course."
5,Good for begginers,"If you don't know anything of Action, I recommend this book. Who knows a little bit, half of the book is great for you. That's it."
5,It's all you'll ever need.,"It really lives up to its name. This book is definitely the bible of Actionscript. It is all you'll ever need for learning Actionscript, and referencing."
1,shoddy workmanship,"unbelievably low-quality plastic, noisy (high-vibration) motor,no fm (dx/local) switch. anti-roll mechanism seems to work, however. save your money..."
2,starts out nice,"Like the Aiwa stereos, the headphones start out nice but if you drop the portables, forget about it. Sure i dropped mine maybe a bit more than others but the set I'm on now is the 2nd one i've bought from Aiwa and it's giving me the same problems the first one did. It won't tune the radio stations anymore and what it does tune in isn't the correct frequency number in the window, the tape will stop playing if you don't hold it a certain way, the headphones go in and out, and the clock will not set and if it does it won't advance to the next hour. that's a first, along with the radio station tuning thing.I suggest getting a carrying case if you purchase this, or basically any walkman if you're clumsy like me or if accidents happen such as carrying too much stuff or having the headphone cord catch on something and pull the radio from your body."
1,Stay Away!!!,"This is the WORST Trail Mix I ever tasted. The fruit part (raisin, papaya, apricots, etc) are super sweet in a bad way, you are better off going directly eating table suger. The peanuts are stale and you can see by eye that at least half of them are BAD. This is anything BUT healthy food. Now what shall I do with a whole box of these?I am very upset at the irresponsibility of the previous reviewer, (at the time I am writing this review, the only one), who give exactly same five star reviews to five different products from this brand (I found out this too late). Lessons learned: next time if you need to make judgement based on reviews, do a QA on the reviews first."
2,"Not natural, too much sugar & stale","I should have believed what the majority of others have noted: this product is rife with food coloring, preservatives and sugar [in the dried fruit]...and mine in particular arrived stale/rancid. I ended up disposing of it.I advised Amazon, and they were very proactive...stopped offering it and assured me they would be getting new stock in: this will hopefully address the stale/rancid issue...but if you are looking for an all-natural product that is not overly-sweet, I recommend looking elsewhere...""Harmony"" products, for all of their hype, do not appear to be oriented towards the health-conscious consumer."
1,LISTEN TO THESE REVIEWS!!,I didn't and I should have. This stuff is the pits. I think it has been stored in a non-temperature controlled warehouse for many moons before being foisted onto unsuspecting Amazon customers. I have TWO CASES of this- the birds and squirrels are in for a treat.This is barely fit for human consumption.Its old and stale.Disgusting.
5,Superb at three times the price...,"This is a gorgeous set of pieces - I was blown away by the quality when I received mine. The design of the knight is especially beautiful. Don't be fooled by the word 'plastic'. These pieces are felted and weighted, and do not look at all like 'plastic', having a nice matt patina. Without touching one, the black pieces have the appearance of wood. Even the pawns feel quite heavy. They're also nicely finished and look and feel as if they'll last a lifetime.I'm so impressed, I'm ordering another set in a different colour combination. The price is ridiculous. I've have paid three or four times what Amazon are asking for a set as elegant and as handsome as this.If you appreciate fine chess sets, you can't afford not add this to your collection. As for me, this will be my main set from now on. Congrats to House of Staunton for having the inspiration."
5,Best knight ever!!,"The knight is what really sets this set apart from the rest, it is simply fantastic! The weight, feel and playability of this set are excellent, and of the 25+ sets I own this is my favorite and most often reached for!For this price, you certainly cannot go wrong. Quality is great!"
4,very good value for the money,"Overall I am happy with this purchase.The quality is good. It is not extraordinary but remember this is a $30 set.But for the price tag it is an excellent value.The colors are a bit different than in the picture: the white pieces are brighter than in the picture.The vinyl board is green and cream color (darker than the white pieces) with the company logo on the far right corner.Shipping is reasonable as it did come in a fairly large box.Frankly, if you look at the catalogs and other offering, to get a set of this design in wood you have to shell out a lot more money so you for the price you get a nice large regulation size set, excellent design.The biggest problem I have with this set is that it wet my appetite and now I want to get a high end one...."
3,Bad print quality,Horrible print quality. Colleagues who ordered it had the same. Looks like it was printed at a home printer that was had clogged and misaligned print heads. It's readable but not sharp. Annoying.Didn't read the contents yet.
5,Recommend,Very good movie. It was interesting to see the goings-on behind the scenes. It did a fair job of remaining neutral.
4,recount,"Overall it was a good transaction. There were a couple stops in the tape towards the beginning, but after that it was fine. I did not contact the seller, as it was a while before I got around to watching it and didn't know there was a problem when I first got it. They should probably be tested before sending them out, but in all honesty, since the seller did not know I had a problem, I can't complain, because I didn't give them the opportunity to return it or correct the problem... Over all, once you get past the beginning, it is just fine and it came in no time. Would buy from again."
2,Waiting for the Sequel...,This is pretty much the Democrat point of view. I really was expecting a part 2 that would explain the Bush position.
3,Spacey Recounting of the 2000 Election,"i remember a lot of details about the 2000 election (it wasn't that long ago after all). i remember going to bed that night with all the networks saying Bush was President only to take up in the morning and to find out everything had changed.i enjoy history and politics so was interested in this movie. it does a great job going over all the issues. it certainly leans in favor of one party over the other. one party is valiant and brave, the other cunning and cheap. but hey, when it comes to politics, that's how it goes i guess. after all, this is an election year."
3,Recount,I had to buy this movie for two reasons........we live in Florida and our youngest son was an extra in the Jacksonville scenes.As a bonus...it's a pretty good movie.
4,Fascinating,"A must-see re-telling of a critical time in our political history. Accurate, to the best of my knowledge, and reasonably fair to both sides. Lots of hanky-panky going on down in the Sunshine State in 2000!"
5,The Truth about American Democracy,"Recount is a sad but truthful reminder that the freedom to vote in America is part illusion. It is also a strong statement that the U.S. Supreme Court can be manipulated to ""spin"" decisions based on the representative power that is in the current majority. As of 2009, five of the nine justices are Roman Catholics, their decisions being influenced deeply by the Pope. That said, Recount offers a factual analysis -- told in drama form -- of the 2000 Presidential election that went to the loser, courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. In hindsight, one can only wonder if 911 would still have occurred under a President Gore (i.e., in the early days of his presidency, President Bush & his Chief of Staff ordered the Director of the CIA to stop briefing them about Osama Bin Laden, saying that they didn't share his concern)."
5,Excellent!,"The complicated events following the 2000 election are dramatized with flair and accuracy (to the best of my knowledge) in this very worthwhile, if depressing film. The pace of the film is intense and the acting is consistently good; I especially enjoyed Laura Dern's portrayal of Katherine Harris. It is important for people not to forget this truly nauseating rift in the fabric of American democracy, to appreciate the potential weaknesses of our election procedures, and to continue to fight for the principle that every vote should be counted."
4,Recount,RecI found it most interesting having lived through it. I wonder if the 2012 debacle will make it to TV.
4,Good Buy for the DIY mechanic,"Product works as described, and it came with exactly the size drivers I needed for my mk3 Jetta wheels. I would recommend this product to anyone who needed to do their own bearings/seals. The only reason I gave it 4/5 was due to the nut coming loose fairly quickly during use with a rubber mallet, it didn't stop the device from working, just can't say how many years of use it will stand up to."
5,Hair color bowl,I was happy to find this product online. It is great. Thanks also for the speed of delivery.
5,Beautiful,The figurine looks exactly as the picture shows. It was very high quality and looks gorgeous. It was purchased for a marine who loved it.
3,Snowy Owl,I love the toy-but not too thrilled with the website that goes with it. Grand daughter likes Webkins 100 time better
1,This book is of little or no use without an index.,"Reference books aren't novels...they're of little or no use without an index. My Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music app for iPhone is a little better, but I can still find any musical term or personage or concept exponentially faster with Google. Don't waste your coins on this."
2,Not up to Par with Timex!,"I ordered this watch for my wife. It arrived yesterday and although a great looking watch,it was not a Swiss movement as described on Amazon web site.In addition the crown was sticking and it was hard to adjust the time and date,also band was way too big and hard to adjust. I am returning it and hope the mens Invicta I ordered is better when it arrives. My wife has put back on her Timex which has always been easy to adjust,confortable and accurate. Invicta 9326 was 3 times more expensive than the Timex and though it looked great the company must address the ergonomic and quality issues for this slightly upmarket watch."
5,Great read,"This was the first book in theology that I read as a freshman as part of a small one-credit class led by Fr. David Burrell, and it helped me to fall in love with the discipline. Wonderful book."
2,Disappointed But Not Transformed,"I was very disappointed with Robert Barron's book. I did NOT ""see"" much of what he's driving at, except when he made analogies with stories, such as from the life of Thomas Merton in Chapter 4 or from a Flannery O'Connor story in Chapter 11. I thought the book would be something more understandable, along the lines of something by Henri Nouwen or Richard Roher."
2,Come And Join Us - hints of things to come.,"After entering the scene in 1974 Petra returned three years later with a giant step away from their scattered, uneven and under produced self-titled debut. On Come And Join Us Petra gave us hints of things to come, including the debut of ""guest vocalist"" Greg X. Volz, who would go on to become the band's frontman for the next nine years. Most of the tracks on Come And Join Us lack the cohesiveness and punch of later efforts. The gem (unpolished as it is) on the project is ""God Gave Rock And Roll To You.""This album is a worthy addition for true Petra fans and CCM music collectors. The casual fan who is familiar with Petra's later projects will not find much that is recognizable here. A better starting point would be 1979's breakthrough Washes Whiter Than.-Mike"
2,This is a very WEAK and also EARLY Petra rock album. For HARDCORE fans.,"I don't own Petra's first cd but I own all the rest up to ""This Means War"" and from there I lost interest in what the band created. I think from that point the band went downhill dramatically. Anyway, I'm not going to waste time on a real cd review of this album. The album has a mix of vocalists and at least one of the singers has no business singing in ANY band, especially a rock band. There are many BAD tracks on this cd and three to five decent songs. Some of the songs on this cd are simply embarrassing and I would most definitely turn the cd down very low when another car was beside me. This cd is for HARDCORE Petra fans ONLY. Washes Whiter Than, which I think came NEXT, is LEAPS and BOUNDS above this effort. This cd doesn't show a lot of talent or promise. Good thing the band got it together rather QUICKLY."
1,This book is a joke,"This book displays a truly colossal ignorance of its subject. That might sound unfairly negative, but put the book to the test. Just open to any given page and you will see error after error. Ok, I've just done that myself to demonstrate: I've opened the book to the page on tanks in this theater. What did I find? The description of the Pershing and Sherman tanks available to the UN forces (US troops). What does it say? That the Sherman was the more effective of the two tanks! Read on ... we soon discover that APC ammo for tank guns is short for ""Armored Personnel Carrier!""Obviously a hack job. There's a growing list of books on the Korean War available -- no need to buy one that obviously doesn't have the first clue of the basics for this theater."
3,could have been more interesting,Some of the narratives were intriguing but they were not developed adequately and most of the participants seemed to be on the verge of a breakdown - it was sad
3,Nipple rings with bulb pump,"A good addition to my toys. Everything works fine and rings work well on me. The one minor issue I have is with the pump, the rings are hard to get off and suction is easily lost in the process, maybe I should just cut off the little lip at the bottom of ring fitment sheath. It is particularly difficult to do on your own, so probably better as a toy for two."
4,Literate & Witty,"On the jacket for this first mystery by Lambda award winner Raphael, Faye Kellerman calls it ""literate, witty"" and ""a delightful romp."" I'm always in the mood for a delightful romp, and I liked this one.Nick Hoffman teaches composition at the State University of Michigan in the capitol, Michiganoloplis, where he lives with his lover, noted writer (and fellow professor) Stefan Borowksi. Trouble begins when Perry Cross, an old lover of Stefan's, comes to SUM and shares an office with Nick. The relationship between Nick and Stefan is particularly strong, and very sweet.I've read most, if not all, of Raphael's books, and they're clever and addictive.Neil Plakcy, author ofMahu Surfer: A Hawaiian Mystery (An Alyson Mystery)"
4,More fun from Lev,"Lev Raphael - Enjoy Lev's academic mysteries and especially get a kick out of the Michigan detail. Brought back memories of working at a teachers credit union for 18 years and have heard many an outrageous tale as told by professors. Lev pins the tail right on. As an aside, Raphael has got to be the most photogenic of authors I have seen in a LONG time."
3,"Not impressed for the price, Geotrax can do better","My kids got this new geotrax piece for Christmas and were very excited. (We also got the rainbow bridge which we LOVE). For the Price $30 (although there were a few pre-holiday sales of $15-20), I was expecting it to light up when the trains go in front of this piece or under it.THAT is my biggest complaint!!!! I like the pieces where they are activated when the trains go on them. This piece the child has to push a button the the front to make it work. It is very cool when it lights up, and we will keep it for our collection, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that isn't a collector.OUR favorite Geotrax Add-on's are:Clock Tower (light activated music as trains go through the tower), Rocky Falls Tunnel (light activated tunnel, water wheel spins & nature sounds), Rainbow Bridge (trains push a button as they pass on the bridge activating the lights)."
2,Looks fancy and that is about it.,"My child LOVES Geotrax and plays with them everyday. However, Big City Lights makes your track look good but doesn't have much for a child to interact; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer. Unlike other pieces with Geomotion this one is a bore. My child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the RC trains go under it."
2,Isn't GeoTrax material,"This piece came with the Mega set we bought for our 2 yr. old daughter. It takes up a lot of room and doesn't do a whole lot. We where particular disappointed with the fact that it doesn't have a sensor for the sounds, you have to push the button. It also doesn't provide much in the way of manual play. I definitely wouldn't have bought this if it was a separate item. It's only twenty dollars but I would rather pay a little more and have the sensor."
3,Mom and 2 year old,Actually I would give this 3.5 stars but there are no 1/2 star options. I was disappointed that the lights and sounds are not triggered by a train going by or through it. The child has to hit a button to make it do any action or moving the crane will also trigger lights/sounds. Also a bit disappointing is that the rope on the crane does not reach to the bottom of the buildings where the first level road is located. In order to put boxes in trucks with crane feature you will have to build a road '1 story' up on the buildings which you can do with risers.However my 2 year old loves it and I would recommend it if you have room for it. There are other pieces I like better but this one isn't bad.
4,music,...... yes ..... Kind of Blue is the greatest recording of all time ...... as an artist Cassandra captures the essence of the music ..... we heard her live before listening to the recording ...... the spouse surprised with the recording as a gift on our anniversary ...... it captures the beauty of the live performance ..... we listen because of our love for the music on Kind of Blue ..... yes
4,Cassandra Wilson,"Love her style! I play Time After Time and Right Here, Right Now over-and-over again. Will definitely check out her other CDs."
4,Multi genre-ational,"It's difficult to peg this record into any particular genre. ""Jazz"" might be the first category that comes to mind, but on this album, Cassandra Wilson taps into a lot of different musical styles. Obviously, the main influence is Miles Davis. Davis had himself covered Cyndi Lauper's ""time after time"" back in the 80s. I'm not sure that was Davis's finest moment, but Wilson gives the song a sultry flavor here with her smoke filled voice. The musicianship and recording clarity are spectacular, and the CD really shines on a great stereo. Wilson is also heavily informed by candomble/santeria, which emerges throughout the disc. Davis had also tapped into that magical Afro Brazilian rhythm, most famously on ""Bitches Brew"". As someone else said in a review here, this record requires pretty close attention, but doing so will, with one or two exceptions, definitely reward the listener."
2,Boring...,"This is not the best effort from Cassandra Wilson. Her earlier recordings were much better. Cassandra Wilson tried to travel miles, but she traveled to far and the miles look alike - boring scenery, same sand around, and the band seems to know only one tune. The American roots are heard here and there, but they do not fit to the cactuses of the spirit you want to get from Cassandra.Try to travel in some other direction."
3,I learned to appreciate it,"I've been a fan of Cassandra Wilson's song stylings since I picked up Blue Skies, a album of jazz standards. Her smoky alto and impeccable delivery were magnificent and made me a fan forever. I will admit that it took some time for Traveling Miles to grow on me. I love her voice and would listen to her sing just about anything, but I wasn't feeling this CD immediately -- it seemed a little skittish what with her eclectic influences. But I soon realized that her eclectic sensibilities are what makes her one of my favorite artists."
4,Miles Would Approve,"Cassandra Wilson replicates the yearning melancholy of Miles greatest tunes with this batch of covers and original tunes in Miles' style. Yet Cassandra gives each tune her personal touch. The mesmerizing high point is Wilson's bluesy ""Someday My Prince Will Come."" Also enjoyed her cover of the great Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" (which Miles recorded in the 80's). This CD is more cohesive than Two Moon Daughter and ought to earn Wilson even more fans."
5,4 stars,I must make it clear that I have only listened to the CD online. I was wonderfuly surprised to hear the same moving voice as on the Love Jones soundtrack. I loved her smokey voice on that CD as well as what I've heard today. Much success!
5,This Time Of Darkness,"""This Time Of Darkness"" follows two classmates Amy and Axel. They are trapped in The City which is crumbling and falling down around everyone's ears. They are told that they can't leave because there is no outside or rather that outside will kill them. But Axel knows a secret, The Outside, is no longer poisonous and people can live out there and have been living out there for quite some time. Axel, himself, is from The Outside and has tried to escape The City many times by going down to level one. Amy tells Axel that there's supposed to be an 80th level that supposed to be better than other levels even though everyone is told all levels are the same. Wanting to see real sunlight and grass and flowers the children decide to escape to see if the legend of level 80 is true and even perhaps find an exit to Freedom."
4,Can't believe I found the book after all these years,"I originally read this book back in eighth grade (1987-88) and remembered the progression of the children, Amy and Alec, going from the bottom of the underground to the surface. For some reason, I thought the book was called Running to the Light or Going to the Light. I also remembered a discussion with the librarian, that it was similar to the many-layered subway systems in NYC. It was not till this weekend, when I was reading another book, A Perilous Power by E. Rose Sabin, and saw the other books by Starscape listed in the front matter, that I started checking out the other authors and found it here on Amazon!"
5,Great applications for the Christian reader,This short-chapter book has many applications that will strengthen your Christian walk. It also clears up misunderstandings you may have. Don't pass up on this one!
1,Please don't support this man,"John Hagee is one of the most hostile preachers on tv today. He's EXTREMELY judgmental, even when we are told in the Bible not to judge others. He's completely homophobic, and he's spreading hatered, and uses the book of love to justify his beliefs. If you want to learn of a loving and unconditional God, I recommend the Conversations with God books. Let us all learn to accept ourselves, and love and accept others for who they are."
4,"N2deep been down,stayed down,still down.......","Containing some westcoast classics such as ""back 2 tha hotel"",and ""Toss up"" this is a nice addition to any cd collection.With a lot more songs on the album (that make up the best of n2deep)I think many of you will be surprised how much more the album is because of the songs that surround tracks 1 and 2... Starting with ""V-town"" feat. e-40 and B-legit,""California hottubs"",Parkin lot pimpin"",""The throw"" feat.Mac Dre,Latino velvet,and Jazz,last but not least what should be a new classic ""Wonderin"".... The 2 and only flaws on the record is that its missing ""Kick way on back"" (from N2DEEP the Golden State album)and ""You should never be broke"" (from the compilation tittled ""spread yo'hustle"")Now N2deep is back in the studio working on there 5th album and like everything before it I know it will be tight..."
5,It helps you to build your concept about IP,"As a law student, I always get into lots of cases but do not have a whole concept of a course.I use this book along with casebook.It helps me to understand substancial law. After reading this book, I can understand my casebook and join class discussion."
5,Have Mercy Percy...............,Very nice recreation of the Percy Sledge experience.Some great memories of my military days.I don't think he ever got the attention his sound warranted.
2,Good While It Lasted,"I found this player to be quite nice until it died. The user interface is good and it played MP3's without problem. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 1-1/2 years before dying. This is with moderate use in an office environment. Absolutely no harsh handling at all. I guess it is a testament to the quality Aiwa puts into their products. Needless to say, I won't buy another Aiwa product again."
3,I expected something better,"I bought this Aiwa player because of its attractive price and bacause of my positive recognition of the Aiwa brand. Previously I had a Rio Volt 90 but it malfunctioned.The only problem with this Aiwa cd player is the squeaking sound produced when turning the volume knob, it went away on the second day, but returned permanently later. I found out that warranty is extended only for 90 days in case of labor so I guess it does not make sense to pay for the repair, whereas labor could cost more then the new player. Battery life is reasonable 5 hours, skipping does not happen too much when walking, design is nice and relatively ergonomic.I do not care about the attached car kit but I am glad to have the ac/dc adapter so that I can use it when I have access to the 110 volts. Headphones are ok but I bought another set of the earbud type ones. There is no remote control but I do not think it is a necessary gadget."
4,Very Good except that it is very sensitive to mp3 burn,"This unit does all that I wanted from my MP3-CD player; search capabilty within a mp3 file, resume play, restart exactly where I left, album & track names display etc, which my other mp3 player (Philips exp 101) was not doing all that well. No shock resistance for mp3, but it hasn't really skipped alot and I am happy with it. But my only complaint is this unit is so sensitive to the way the burner has burnt. I had to make several tries before it could understand the files in it. But with my Philips it is a breeze. For the price and performance this one is a good buy."
2,OK,This product is not a good cd-mp3 player. When you burn mp3's the player has very bad quality sound. The volume is very staticy. The regular cd player is fine. I dont suggest to buy it.
3,"Good for inside information, not doctrine","I bought this book wanting to learn more about the culture of Muslim women. For that, the book is interesting. But the theology and doctrine in the book are weak (I know its not a book about theology or doctrine, but some parts of the book make comments that make you wonder what kind of believers the writers are). I would not recommend for an immature Christian simply b/c Christ and Truth are compared to other beliefs as if they are equal. There are probably better books out there showing what the lives of Muslim women are like."
3,Ok for the price,"Does more vibrating than massaging. Not like the ""professional"" ones that sell for a little more money. Too much buzzing to help you relax."
2,An Enchanted Let-down,"I came sum this book up in three words: STUPID, STUPID & STUPIDDumb characters that were never fully developed, idiotic dialogue that simply doesn't make sense, and utterly poor, ridiculous story line.And not to mention that the book was totally predictable. I figured out how the book was going to end after I finished reading chapter 1.I really wish author's would put more thought into their work. Author's are not merely writers, they're business people. Their books represent their product, and if they want me as a customer to keep buying their product, they have to produce ""QUALITY"" work.Felicia Mason cannot keep slapping meaningless words together on sheets of paper and expecting the public to buy a poor product.NOT!!!"
1,"This is not ""ATTACK""","Although this listing says it's ""ATTACK!"", the CD you'll get if you order this item is actually ""Attack of the Giant Revillos"". These are two different CD versions of the original album. ""ATTACK!"" from Captain Oi Records (item ID ""AHOY CD 212"") is the better release of the two."
1,horrible,"This is the most ridiculous recording I have ever heard. I want my money back! Gould ruins each piece (even the few he plays well) with humming in the background. As picky as record producers are, I am surprised they even wasted the money to reissue this recording on Masterworks. The humming makes it unbearable to listen to. Some of his interpretations are fine, but he completely destroys the D minor Fantasia. I could play it better! Great music, horrible recording!"
5,Narco,"This is one of the coolest book I've ever read. It actually felt like I was watching a movie--the characters and scenes are so vivid, and the plot rivals anything that Hollywood has put out lately. I can't wait to read another Everardo Torrez book."
2,Not what i expected.,This is not the Harold I expected from the Scholastic Collection. Colors are nice but Harold rarely draws - he is part of things around him and does not draw his environment. A disappointment when you've seen the other one and expected like creativity. Kids familiar with the other felt like this too.
2,much prefer the scholastic version,I bought this DVD thinking it was like the scholastic version i had previously bought for my daughter.... I was pretty disappointed :( Its OK but the scholastic version is soooo much better.
5,My 4 year old loves this!!!!,"I bought these for my 4 year old because he loves Harold and the Purple Crayon, but HBO stopped showing it. He loves it! And has been watching it almost nightly since I gave it to him. For the price, it really is worth it!"
1,"Not Crockett Johnson's ""Harold.""","The loneliness, sparkling wit and beautiful simplicity of the original Purple Crayon books (and the quite loyally adapted Gene Deitch animated cartoons - still available from Scholastic) are not to be found here, sacrificed to the treacly situations and inexplicable pastel colors of this confused, frustrating - and to this viewer at least - insulting ""interpretation."" It's as if Harold were aesthetically reincarnated as one of those hard sugar figurines manufactured for quick decoration of grocery store birthday cakes. I bought this believing that the Emmy bestowers would actually have some sense of taste when awarding their prizes, but in this case, I simply ended up tossing my set away. (I only am posting this as a warning to anyone who might be hoping to find some flavor of the original works in this adaptation; contemporary kids might like this on its own terms, which is ""the way things are"" -but this is not Crockett Johnson's ""Harold."")"
5,My son rates it EIGHT stars!,"We haven't seen the dvd yet, but we have all the episodes saved on our Tivo because he asks for them by name. He loves loves loves Harold and the Purple Crayon, and so do his friends. He watches it every night before he goes to bed and it helps him get more ready for bed. DH and I like it more than a lot of other kids series' because it isn't annoying for us.Did I mention that my 2 1/2 year old son loves this series?"
3,Case of the Cutes,"After loving the books as a kid, I now read them to my own children, yet wanted the video version on hand to see how the producers made the adaptation. (Sigh). Emmy-winning or not, the HBO Family adaptation replaces the child's imagination with that of the animation company and pads the storylines to fill 22 minutes for each episode. The pan-and-scan version that Captain Kangaroo ran back in the 50s seemed so much better because it stuck to the drawings and text of the book and let the child do the extrapolating. I know this is how it's done today, but it's so sad. I think I'll keep the DVDs on the shelf for now."
4,"Great series, one DVD didn't work","My toddler LOVES Harold. I would have given this five stars had both DVDs worked. The second one just wouldn't play, in numerous DVD players. Sad times! I am a NO TV!! mom most of the time. I liked this series because it is paced appropriately for a small child, teaches valuable lessons, and episodes are in 20-25 min. chunks. I would definitely recommend this series to other mindful mamas."
4,the return of mac meezie,"whoo...I really like this album,its pretty tight as usual KYRHEE always comes tight in laying down the beats,and wid MAC MALL over the tracks you cant lose!!!Definitly go buy this cd!!!! AND ONCE AGAIN LIKE I SAID ""GO SUPPORT YOUR BAY AREA MUSIC!!!YOU SUCKA @SS SELL OUTS!!!"
2,for non hip hop lovers,"damn if you like an album that sounds worse than dmx, buy this one. how can anyone like it, its made for kids who think they are 'street' and dont know the real thing. unfortunately, the bay hasn't had any real hits yet. im not a hater, im just sayin what i think of this album, don't own it but listened to it many times to be sure about it. this is not just my opinion, many people think this waymac malls production is low and uninspired, with beats that sound like party anthems, the lyrics dont tell anything, it feels more like a compilation than like a real album"
1,not a very nice story,"We watched this dvd to the end, hoping that it would get better but it didn't. For 40 minutes, you don't know where it is going, it's a slow introduction. So half-way through the movie, you still don't have a clue what it will be about. The acting was good but the story was just a long slow day in the life of a woman. Sometimes the characters are nice, sometimes they are awful, so you never know if you like them, and you can never relate to any of them."
3,Predictable but interesting storyline,"Chase is a former Navy SEAL taking time off in Key West, recovering from a bad dive and having some strange dreams (both while asleep and awake. He's drawn to his therapist neighbor, Callie whose OCD comes in handy for constantly taking care of her younger brother Jeff, who manages to find trouble wherever he goes, and now stands accused of murder at sea. Jeff's memories and Chase's dreams seem eerily connected. Can Chase take another dive to help secure Jeff's freedom and win Callie's heart?Lee's psychological romantic thriller has a pretty predictable bad guy, but the storyline is really interesting and Lee manages to provide insight into deep sea diving that readers will find engaging."
2,No Organization,"The book is divided into two very general areas: 1) Study and Training and 2) Research and Creative Activities.Basically, in order to find a fellowship/grant that you are eligibile for, you need to read through every single entry. VERY BAD."
5,GREAT for aching hands,"I have used these for doing needlework, just working at the computer when my hands ache; and purchased a pair for a friend who has arthritis. They are wonderful for providing support and soothing the ache."
5,Great Disco CD,"One of the best compilations of disco music made (at least that I have found) is this one, along with Volumes 1 & 2 from this series (Volumes 4-7 are good, but not great). The only song on this set I could have skipped is Soul Mankossa. It's still great. I like to workout to this CD."
4,Admirable Collection of Disco,"Despite a few oddities, the bulk of this CD is disco and pop hits from 1974 - 80. It's not as comprehensive as volume one, but it does boast all-original versions and great sound."
3,TINY! What could you use them for?,"I know the movie hasn't come out yet, so I don't know if there are miniature ponies in it. But I saw these at Target and they are TINY! They are about 2 inches long! Just what a mother needs. More tiny little toys to get lost, and what are they for? No dolls are small enought to ride them. I'd stick with the Kelly dolls that come with bigger ponies if I were you."
3,"OK, not as good as some other Erskine books.","Brabara Erskine has great talent for description of places. I really felt as if I were at the castle of Duncairn, with its cold, damp winters and sunny, breezy springs.The parts about Isobel, Countess of Buchan in the 14th century, were thrilling. I felt her terror as she was imprisoned and her sense of freedom while on horseback. Too bad she spent most of her time brooding over a man who never loved her as much as she loved him.The modern-day parts about Claire, however, were not as good. Claire needed to GET A LIFE. The poor-little-rich-girl who casts herself as everybody's victim got tiresome for me.If you're a Barbara Erskine fan you'll probably like this book. This is the fourth book of hers that I've read; ""Midnight is a Lonely Place"" was by far the best."
5,Thumbs up but don't wait for the movie...,"I love David Lindsey's books and I was a little reluctant to read this one because his usual protagonist, Stuart Haydon, was not the protagonist. That said, I was very pleased with this book and echo what was said in the other reviews. For some reason, I prefer male protagonists, but I was able to relate to both the protagonist and the sympathetic antagonist women in this book. GUYS WILL LIKE THIS BOOK. On a side note, however, I was told at my favorite bookstore (Murder Ink in NYC) ""good news, bad news"" -- good news is that the movie rights have reportedly been bought -- bad news is by DEMI MOORE. Not a good fit. But read this book, you won't regret it."
1,The Worst I have read!,This novel is a complete waste of time and money. Don't you dare buy this book.
1,Obsolete Product,"I am shocked to see this item for sale. On May 26, 2012 DishTV customer service informed me that the 301 receiver is OBSOLETE. It is old technology that DishTV no longer supports. You can not activate it and receive tv signals with it."
1,Defective Product,The remote and the receiver could not communicate. Waste of my return shipping cost.
2,301 Obsolete,"If this is in fact a 301rcvr, they are currently/eventually being replaced on all dish accounts. In a small amount of time it will not function as all 301rcvrs are to be put to rest. Be sure it is at least a 311rcvr before buying."
3,"Great chips, just don't count on many of them arriving in one piece.","These chips are delicious, far superior to any of the other fat free Pringles offerings (and their plain fat free chips are pretty darn good). If you're trying to drop weight, one serving of these, 14 chips, comes in as just one point on Weight Watchers. So, if you see them in the store, I wholeheartedly recommend them.However...I have ordered several cases of these through Amazon, and although I had one case get through that had few problems, the rest of the cases I've ordered have had more broken chips than unbroken chips. They just can't seem to ship these safely enough to protect the product. I've kept gambling by buying more cases on Amazon, because the dollar value here is a really good deal...but I think I'm going to give it up and start buying them in the store again; the broken chip thing is just too irritating."
1,Too Much Filler,"Only hardcore disco collectors will enjoy this filler-laden CD. As with volume four, buyers should investigate greatest hits CDs of the big artists (Donna Summer, Diana Ross, etc) before looking into this. And how did 1986's ""I Can't Wait"" by Nu Shooz end up here???"
2,Disappointed,I ordered this watch as a present for my wife. I am very disapointed. The watch never worked well at all. It would stop ticking all the time even when she wore it continuously. I have the 8926 which works perfectly fine ( No problems whatsoever). Nothing but problems with this model. Even more disappointing because we don't have the matching watches anymore.
5,Cook's toy,"This machine is so great I wonder why it took me so long to buy one. I've tried many of the recipes that came with it and they all turned out great. I make the bread recipe every few days so we always have fresh, delicious bread. Making soup is such a snap. It takes longer to wash the veggies than to cut them in the processor. That is so fast I almost feel cheated out of playtime. I tried the mayonnaise this week, and also the pie dough. I use the processor daily and find it easy to use and easy to clean. The lucite cleans like a breeze in warm water or else I put it in the dishwasher. I couldn't recommend this item more highly..."
2,CAUTION!!!!!,"This is a REALLY ANNOYING toy. My neice asked for it for her birthday. Now her parents want to kill me. It was a cute idea, but the execution sucks. The dog just makes the same whining and barking noises over and over, on a repetitive loop. They can put a man on the moon, but they can't make a frickin' toy with some variation in sound effects? Might as well be a pull-string dealie like I had in the 70's. Come on, now!"
3,What's up with this CD?,This CD is edited! What the hell is that all about? It is a good CD otherwise though. Why would they do that? I could not find one that was unedited either!
4,This album was not a disappointment!!!,"This album might not have been East Point's Greatest Hit, but it is not as disappointing as some people are making it out to be. As a matter of fact, this was one of 99's most overlooked hip hop albums. The production might not have been as stunning as Organized Noize's previous work, but it was pretty solid and impressive for a debut effort. Ghetto Camelot, Watch For The Hook, Hitman, The Field, and We Eastpointin' all have great beats and hooks. I think that people expected too much from this album and when it was not what they were hoping for they were ready to bash it. Some of the rhymes and tracks may be average at best(e.g. We Get It Crunk and Good Good, and Doin' It In The South), but they are not so bad that they spoil the entire album. I recommend this as another good release from the Dungeon Family."
2,"Watch For the Hook, and...","So, we all like the song Watch For the Hook, no doubt it is tight with all the help from the Dungeon Family, but what else is there!? I'm afraid these Greatest Hits don't offer much of anything else, a few songs are worth playing once in a blue moon, but Overall this CD was a huge dissapointment as I looked forward to it for nearly a month!"
2,Major Dissapointment,"This CD is a major, MAJOR, dissapointment. Watch for the Hook is a tight song, but he just couldn't keep the tight tracks coming. Don't buy this CD just cuz Watch for the Hook is good, the album is a major downfall."
1,Waste of money,Doesn't provide enough suction to even stay attached. I regret wasting my money on this purchase. Glad it didn't cost more.
5,My Favorite Harjo since She Had Some Horses,"A Map to the Next World is a stunningly good collection of poems from Native America's best poet. As the title indicates, this is something of a guide to making it to what happens next in a complicated life. As such, it is the story of a Harjo's own journey. These poems come in a progression that is reminiscent of Harjo's classic She Had Some Horses, but here she is more experienced, wiser, tougher, and absolutely a master of the language of her craft. The climax of Map to the Next World is a long poem that explores the complex relationship of Harjo to her father. It alternates between tight prose paragraphs on one page and stark, breathing poetry on the facing page. It's among her strongest poems ever, an explication of pain coupled with the wonderment of the endurance of love. Harjo has published a children's book and has turned to writing fiction. A Map to the Next World is certain evidence as to why poetry remains her oldest and best literary home."
3,Why the illegible subtitles?,I can tell this is a great movie. I wanted to see it. I was prepared to love it. But the SUBTITLES are illegible and inadequate and I am going to protest this problem every time I am subjected to it. Legible subtitles have been around for many decades. There is NO EXCUSE for these.
5,Sociology unit on poverty,Great film makes you want to do something to help others! I think the human element becomes the primary draw of the movie.
5,GREAT MOVIE!,Bought this movie because I saw it on Netflix and was so impressed with it. It's probably one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Was very happy to see that Amazon offered it at a reasonable price. Will enjoy watching it again and again.
5,see this film,This is a great film that projects hope and displays that there is great humanity even a the lowest levels of the economic stream
5,Stunningly beautiful!,I knew nothing about this documentary before I watched it and I must say it was one of the best films I have ever seen. It touched me in a way I did not expect. To see where these people are now was wonderful. What an absolutely beautiful thing this artist did for these people. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone.
5,Uplifting and Informative,I saw this film in a festival in 2010. I was blown away. There is a lot of information about the lives of the people who participate in the project and the documentary is positive and inspiring.
5,One of the most important watches to include in your Invicta collection.,"If you have or are building an Invicta Watch Collection, Congratulations to you. You may wish you never started that when you find out how many there are to select from. There are thousands of choices. They range from the extreme sports fan to a very formal dress type. There's a watch to wear to a Nascar race, Pro Wrestling match, and the Opera.The 9312 full gold color and blue face is the closest match to the Rolex Mariner there is. These are not light watches. All of them are very substantial. No matter which one you wear, someone is going to compliment you for wearing it. If you own an automatic Invicta, unless you only wear that watch, I recommend you purchase an automatic watch winder. Otherwise, it will eventually stop.There are a lot of watch companies and all my research and experience tells me you cannot go wrong if you select Invicta."
4,Looks Very Expensive!,"What a beautiful watch! It looks like it cost a fortune. Visually it is very appealing, just wish the bracelet links were a little heavier. For the price, you can't go wrong! Can't wait to get it sized and wear it to see what other people think about it. I bet they will be shocked if I tell them how much I paid!"
2,Invicta 9312 Pro Diver,Very unhappy with this watch. Had it for less than a week and all the gold is coming off the band.I do not recomend this watch. Very cheap design.
3,"Looks nice, but not exactly as pictured","I purchased this watch because I got it for a steal- I paid about 75$ and got it shipped overnight. The pictures and reviews made it seem flawless, but when I recieved it, I was a little dissappointed.The outer part of the band does not look as classy as I had hoped, but the inside is brilliant and polished. The face goes very nicely with the watch, but the band just looks a little cheap."
5,Invicta Gold w Blue Face #9312,"Beautiful watch color combinations of gold on blue face. Swiss movement. Safety clasp. Heavy and well made. will get many compliments. Looks like a Rolex. Keeps great time. Took it to Kay Jewelers and they sized it for me at no charge. Thank you Kay Jewelers! Kay also has a lifetime battery replacement so don't worry about changing the battery, just take it to them. I read the reviews about the batteries and inquired about this. The instruction manual is generic for all Invicta watches and was not very helpful for the operation of the safety clasp on the band. One has to pull down the inside piece of the watch clasp toward your wrist and lift up the clasp door and then it will pop open. Enjoy this watch when it comes available again. Got mine for $117."
5,Silberstang's book is the best casino gambling reference.,"Having read a number of books on casino gambling, I find that Silberstang's is the best. I always recommend to friends who are about to embark on their first trip to Vegas that it is essential to read a book first...and to UNDERSTAND it! I have given copies of Silberstang's book to several of my friends, and recommend it to everyone.Steve ""JUNIOR"" Sample"
1,Not delivered!,"I ordered 2 other CDs and like them but for some unknownreason the Ballroom Hits was returned for improper address.Gee, the 1st 2 CDs got delivered. Now I have to pay shippingall over again and keep my fingers crossed."
4,As advertised...........,Bought this to practice ballroom dancing at home. The music is true to the beat for each of the represented dances. A little more contemporary and more enjoyable than most ballroom collections.Have fun!
5,excellent dance CD,"The beat is right on for ballroom dancing. Have played it with beginners to advanced dancers. Beginners seem to have problems dancing to the music, whereas the advanced dancers love it. There are #2 CDs and a nice variety of music and dances. Highly recommend this CD."
2,This is not a picture of the RH157,"After buying this item, to my great dismay I found that the picture of the RH157 is actually a picture of the RH154 and that the RH157 (not pictured) does not work on a 2000 Escort ZX2. Before buying a (Ford) item like this on Amazon, check out the Motorcraft website for compatibility information and then make the call. Good luck!"
3,thermostat housing,item is great.. only thing is that it's not as perfect as i hoped ... missing the hole where i can connect the thermostat pressure checker
1,This is NOT for Focus SVT!,"I ordered this part for my 2003 Ford Focus SVT, and this is the wrong part. You need part RH-154, not RH-157. The RH-154 is a direct replacement with the openings pre-plumbed to add the sensors that are needed. Also, I found out that when you use a new housing but keep your old sensors, remember to use gasket sealant around them too!Amazon was great, and issued the refund but it was time wasted for a wrong part."
2,I THREW THIS ONE IN THE TRASH!,"Honestly! I read this book and threw it in the trash after I finished it. Let me tell you why......... Allie spends the entire book lusting and having sex with Raven, the 100+ year old ""shapeshifter."" She never even kisses Daniel, the warrior, native american who is helping her find the ""key"" to Raven's past. Yet, at the end of the book, ""Raven"" dies, goes to Heaven, whatever, and she discovers <GASP> that she was actually in love with Daniel the entire time.It was bizarre.I first discovered Sherri whitefeather when I read Apache Nights, which I loved. It was a keeper, unfortunately, Never Look Back, wasn't. The ending totally screwed the entire book.Don't waste your money!"
2,Not a good cam,My experience with this camera was not so good. I thought 5mega pixal cam will be wonderful with this price but it was not so. It take very strange pictures with too much yellow color.It can not work in rapidly changing light environment too.
2,Very Disappointed,"I will be returning this camera today. I bought it because the price was good for 5mp with digital zoom. The zoom is great but many of my pictures dark and they were blury if there was ANY movement - even in the ""action"" setting. I liked the size and ease of use but none of that matters when all you've got are dark, blury pictures."
2,Too Much Non-Hit Material,"Big hits (""Good Times"" and ""Hot Stuff"") are interspersed with dance filler, most of which will be unfamiliar to music lovers. You'll be better off buying the anthologies of Diana Ross, Donna Summer, and Chic before you look into this volume and volume five, which is equally unbalanced."
3,A breath of fresh air,"This is a young band making nice sounds with horns. Reminds me of a young, Terry Kath-Chicago Transit Authority. The cd has a variety of sounds. While not an awesome effort, I appreciate the freshness. This stuff plays well live. I hope they join the jam band circuit!"
4,"strong, heavy duty product","This portfolio case came faster than I expected it would. It is very sturdy and will hold a lot of pieces. i was disappointed to see that there are no binder rings inside to allow for sleeve pages to be inserted, but rather, it has two sleeves on wither side to fit in pieces loosely."
5,Interesting Book!,"This textbook was interesting, informative, and easy to read! Two thumbs up! One of the better ones as far as I'm concerned!"
1,not what I was looking for,"only one short cd that cost as much as a novel, and the whole thing was much to silly for my taste."
2,Not At All What I Expected,"I expected a lot more from a book that purports to contain primary sources. A lot of the primary sources included have been sugarcoated- especially Columbus' letter home to Luis de Santangel, which in reality contained many more instances of brutality in Columbus' and his crew's actions toward/perceptions of the native people. Primary sources, in my view, are supposed to contain as much as possible the actual documents. I expect the truth from primary sources, not just another editor or author's perspective. Some of these sources are useful, especially as an alternative to textbook accounts, but they're not for the teacher aiming at teaching for social justice."
4,Pitching your Script!,"""The PERFECT PITCH is the perfect book to read before you pitch your script to any Hollywood Agent or Producer. it will not get you into the room, but it will increase your chances of getting the player behind the desk to read your screenplay."" -- RMS"
4,The Perfect Pitch,"I read the book and attended 3 of Ken's pitch marts and I have been thoroughly satisfied. I wish I had read the book and attended the LA sessions 5 years earlier - it would have saved me a lot of time. Following his advice on pitching has opened a few doors that I had a hard time opening prior to his help. There is a whole industry in LA preying upon people hoping to ""make it"". And they have a lot of ""expensive"" and contradictory advice. I appreciate Ken's straightforward, to the point, and sincere advice. Whereas some ""consultants"" in LA charge an arm and a leg for their dubious advice, I have always found Ken to be someone who takes a real interest in people, is willing to spend time with them, and doesn't have you ""on the clock."" There is no ""one"" book to open up the doors to Hollywood, no secret formular - so anyone expecting that has misplaced expectations. But this is one book that should be among your top 10 if you are trying to sell a screenplay."
5,The Perfect Pitch Book For Me,In short...I have read all the books on pitching self and product and Ken's book took me from being a less than stellar pitcher to pitching with the best of them and getting Yes after Yes.
2,Marginal at Best,"This book doesn't deliver what you're looking for. First of all, Mr. Rotcop says he was head of four studios. When I hear ""studio"" I'm thinking UNIVERSAL, PARAMOUNT, MGM...not small production companies that own studio eqpt and lot space...that turn out B pictures straight to video or third rate cable TV.Secondly, the book doesn't seem to be much more than an advertisement for his workshop. I hope that his workshop is good--however, the book leaves quite a bit to be desired. It is odd to me that he has trouble giving ""evidence"" of success stories based on his own Pitchmart other than a few stories of B/straight to video pieces. In a word I was UNDERWHELMED."
1,The Perfect Pitch,"This book was one large waste of time. I needed a book that was informative and full of examples, without personal promotion. I felt the only thing this book did was drop names and promote the writer. He told a bunch of stories about how good pitches can work and his success stories, but did not go into, in any length, how to write a really good pitch. I felt this book was a mere tool to help promote his writer's workshop. I do not recommend this book to anyone. If you are looking for an actually helpful book, check out ""The Savvy Screenwriter""."
3,Drama and English Teaching,"This book is a great idea, especially these days, when drama is becoming an important tool for the language teacher, since it promotes confidence, motivation, memory, team-work, autonomy, diligence, etc. - there's lots of research on this. However, though ""The Play's the Thing"" has some great excerpts from plays, the fact is that it does not present them using a holistic approach, as it claims. Instead, the excerpts are very short and the follow-up activities are very very traditional, teacher-centred and (sorry about this) boring for the teacher and the student.However, this is a great format. It would be good if Cambridge (or another publisher) could come out with a similar book that IS student-centred and holistic. This is such a wonderful topic."
5,Me Again!,"This is a story of a man who appears in other peoples bodies. Seeing David White dressed as a woman may not be the greatest thing to watch in the world, but I really enjoyed the movie and was glad to have watched it."
2,"nope, didn't cut it. Nice try though.","Didn't like that he was dressed like a woman when he ""became"" different people. I get the plot, nice idea to put yourself into others shoes. Just not expecting the male wearing female stuff in a family movie. Threw it out for that reason. Didn't want to have to be explaining that to the kids I take care of and my grandkids, and want better example for my friends. Other than that it would have been a good movie."
3,Decent movie.,"Not David White's best, but it was an OK movie. Now that I have seen it, I will say that I would probably order it again - so it wasn't all that bad. If you are looking for a clean, entertaining Christian based movie, this one fits in very well."
1,Not very entertaining,"Well it seems that my fellow reviewer has summed up this film quite nicely and even given a pretty involved blow by blow. So I'm just going to make this short and sweet, this film was bad and not very entertaining. If you're looking for very bad acting and off timing acting along with a weak script, have at it. I can't recommend this film at all."
4,A must read for the true story of Mount Vernon,"This book was very informative. I learned the ""behind the scenes"" of the great historic preservation movement in action. The book was very in depth and very easy to read!"
3,"A bit crude, works better after a clean and lube","The tool is a bit crude but acceptable for the price. The ballhead lock has to be too tightened too much to secure the ballhead. Machine tolerances are not tight. Items placed in the ballhead still spin in the ballhead hole after tightening. It may be helpful to add some paper or a toothpick in the ballhead hole to help keep the vise from spinning.The tool can be improved by cleaning and lubing it. I used a spray can of water-free isopropyl alcohol to clean the moving parts (they came from the factory pretty dirty) and then lubed the the screws and guides with synthetic lithium/teflon grease, making sure to get lots of grease into the ballhead via the ballhead lockdown screw. I added synthetic oil to the vise spinner washers. After wiping off excess oil & grease, it works a lot smoother now. Keep oil and grease away from the part of the vise that inserts into the ballhead hole, you want that surface to be clean & dry."
3,Definitely Handy but...,"unfortunately, not as well made as it could be. Rather crude construction which is disappointing, but nothing that impairs it's ability to do what it needs to."
3,not heavy duty enough for much.,"the plastic jaw that come with vise won`t hold much,will have to wait to see how it holds up.would not purchase again."
2,Not Worth the Price,"This item is not worth the $28 in the ""today's Deals"" price let alone the $49 retail price. Very poor quality. The Base is extremely light weight and has no bulk/base weight to it like a vise should have to support items held."
4,Good quick read.,"This was my first John Cuddy mystery, and it was definitely a worthwhile read. Healy shows off his hero's code of honor in this book, as Cuddy promises to help a young boy and then comes through. The novel is entertaining, a few of the murders gruesome, and the finale, well done. There are a few incidents where it seemed the author had backed himself into a corner and needed a bit of a overwritten solution with one of the characters (not to give anything away). Overall, a fun read, a decent villain, and just a plain good PI novel. Not his best, but not bad either."
5,A Pleasure to Continue the Series,A great series featuring P.I. John Cuddy.Well written making it an enjoyable read.
4,wild ride,"These characters will follow you. I've never read something quite so suspenseful (I had to hold myself back from flipping ahead) but also so literary. Mooney takes the reader on a weaving journey through the past and into the depths of relationships. A wonderful novel.After reading Father of the Man, I was on a bus when a passenger became belligerent and starting ranting and yelling. My first thought was, ""Here we go! Into the Pennsylvania wilderness, just like Dutch."" But sometimes, life doesn't turn out as carefully constructed (or as beautiful) as it does in novels."
5,A great novel,This is a great book that reached out and touched me. I thought the story was great and i learned a lot> If your looking for a good book i advise this one strongly.
5,"Excellent story, great characters, terrific writing style!","Mooney scuplts a detailed, whirling, exciting story in ""FATHER OF THE MAN"". The research is exhaustive, the writing style fluid and strong, the story full of suspense. A great read."
1,Just like everything else,I found little in this book that was original or creative. Entire passages seemed to be pointless padding. Pass this one up.
3,Can't Avert My Eyes!,"I am a faithful Gear's reader but I must say this book didn't grab my attention like some of their others. The story was original and of course the research was amazing but I couldn't connect with Rumbler like I wanted too. Wren and the other characters I could see well and I enjoyed reading about them and learning about their lives but maybe I am just prejudice and couldn't get past the vision of seeing a dwarf as our hero. I know its wrong but I have seen maybe a few midgetts in my life time and unfortuantly was unable to divert my eyes. When I read a story, if its a good arthur, I will be able to envision the story unfold in my head and when I read about Rumbler its like one of those midgetts; I can't get past the dwarf part. I try not to judge and I try not to stare but I can't help it and it distracts me from the soul of the story. Overall it was a fascinating story and I will read the next of the series."
3,See it coming,"Number ten in the series: great detail and use of beliefs and customs to create a thrilling story; deep characters and motives; power that lives out and inside of everything; very instructive of the life in those days. But... you can say right from the start who are the bad and who are the good guys, who is stupid and who is intelligent, who is going to die and who is going to see another day. And the end was exactly what I expected: too good to be true, like in a Disney movie.In other words, originality was a little bit lost in this one."
4,Consistent Entertainment,The Gears' continue to both entertain and enlighten with this latest in their series. The characters are as vivid and detailed as I have come to expect from this series and the environmental descriptions bring the reader to stand side by side with the characters. I continue to recommend this series to everyone I know who enjoys not only the past from an historical pov but also a darned good story!
3,another descent book,this book and mist was for me probly the weakest out of all of the series of books. I got it because it was a gear's book but i had to force my why thought it.
5,People of the Mask,"This was the best book I've read in a very long time. It was difficult to set it down for anything. The charters came to life. Little Wren tugged at your heart, and Raven her uncle was a real hero. If you want a book with action,drama,adventure and a touch of history. This book is for you."
1,cuisinart can opener,This is not a good can opener at all. very difficult to attach the can to the blade. blade corrugates the cover and rips the label leaving paper fragments on the counter.....
1,Cuisinart Can Opener 5 Star Yuck Don't buy it!!!!,"OK, I am just wrapping up the second one of these worthless can openers to return to where I purchased it. No wonder it is listed as almost 50% off. It's not worth a plug nickel unless you have 10 minutes to spare each time you need to open a can. DON'T BUY unless you want to get revenge on someone!!!I am totally serious and thanks for letting me vent."
1,Don't Buy-anything is better,"This can opener looks nice, is a higher priced opener, and is Cuisinart so you expect something worthwhile. It was the worst can opener Ihave ever tried to use. Doesn't line up, top falls off. Much like the other reviewer said-we gave up and used our manual opener. So we returned it. Now I am trying the Krups, which also looks nice, so far so good."
1,cuisinart can opener,This is not a good can opener at all. very difficult to attach the can to the blade. blade corrugates the cover and rips the label leaving paper fragments on the counter...
1,"Worked great at first, broken 3 months later","Looks great, feels sturdy...but now, three months later after normal use, we need to push the handle in a certain way in order to get it to work at all. The cans are no longer held up by the can opener, and we have to work at it for quite a while before the lid comes completely off. Very disappointed."
5,No complaints.,"As we've migrated all our entire kitchen counter top to Cuisinart appliances, we've been generally very pleased with form and function. This opener is no exception. It's steady, sturdy, attractive and effective. It will not tip over even with a 2 pound can of dog food on it, and its grip is good even on nearly-rimless cans, a feat our recently departed Black and Decker could not match."
4,Easy to use,Nice can opener. Very sturdy. Although the handle comes off easily for cleaning it also can come off while putting the can on if you aren't sure at first how it works. You just have to push down the handle very easy and it goes.I am pleased with it. Couldn't stand the Gizmo.
2,Disappointing for the Dollar,"I bought this opener thinking, hey an 80 dollar opener purchased [on sale]must be a really good one. Not so! Easy release top is always coming off when you don't want it to. Cans are difficult to place for opening. You would think that a can opener, listing for 80 bucks would have a definative guide, so that you could place your cans for fast opening. Less coordinated people like my elderly mom can't use the thing. It often takes me one or two attempts to get the can in the right position to get it started. I'd rather get a good manual one than use this thing."
1,Waste of Money,"this opener is frustrating and overall completely ineffective. when i first tried using it, i thought it was just me...couldnt get the opener to grip the can on the first, second or third try. eventually the thing stopped cutting into the metal lid at all. it drops cans after cutting is complete, splashing contents everywhere. i dont mind paying a bit more for a quality product, but this is definitely NOT it.."
1,Not worth the higher price,"Worked OK, if one excludes the splashing of liquid contents on the opener and countertop. Frequently, when it finishes opening the can, the lid moves suddenly and splashes liquid on the opener and elsewhere - cleanup required. Now, after a year's use, the auto shutoff is becoming intermittent - one has to babysit the opener to try to stop it."
1,Sorry can opener and a waste of money!,"I, too, thought that this would be a top of the line can opener for $80+ but this is not the case at all. It arrives in good enough condition...very heavy...feels sturdy. Within one month of use, the plastic fitting that holds the cutting blade to the opener and pushes the button simultaneously, wiggled apart and it would no longer open cans. I called Cuisinart customer service and they were actually rather rude at first. I finally got a return authorization but, lo and behold, I had to pay to ship this useless, heavy object back to them for repair. After $80, I decided that I would have more in it than I would ever get out of it. Shop around! Because of this incident...I don't buy Cuisinart products anymore."
2,Chinese throwing lids....,"This thing is stable and powerful, but really chews up the lids leaving sharp jagged edges. Also, I seem to be the only one able to get the cans aligned in the thing. My wife, mother, guests, etc. usually give up after a few tries and have me do it."
1,worst can opener ever owned,"This can opener has been a total waste of money! We use our manual opener more than this 'door stop'!It doesn't line up a can properly and is just frustrating to manipulate to use.It looks nice, but isn't worth it.I'm going to replace it and toss this piece of junk away!!!!"
4,it cannot hold a 32 oz can,"I bought this product to open a 32 oz can, but it does not work since a 32 oz can is bigger than the can opener size.otherwise, this is a great product so far."
1,DISCONTINUED!!!!,I liked the can opener except for the cheap plastic cutting assembly. It broke and I cannot find a replacement part because they discontinued the can-opener.
5,Blade/magnet piece broke-replaced free,I bought from Amazon in 2005. The top piece with blade/magnet broke in 2009. I called Cuisinart 800-726-0190 listed in manual (see cuisinart.com/share/man/16_man.pdf) and they are sending a free replacement part! A year after warranty expired. They simply offered the part as a courtesy. I was ready to purchase it. Nice!
1,Looks great - doesn't work,"It's tall, it's heavy, it's pleasing to the eye ... It just doesn't open cans.Don't be fooled by it's style, it's weight, or the name on the lable. It will end up a large paper weight.Really, really, stay away and save your money.We've had this ""opener"" about 6 months. At first it opened almost all cans, by the 6th month it wouldn't open any can unless you held the can and turn the can yourself.I really thought that Cuisinart made a quality product. This opener seemed like it would be, but bueaty is really only skin deep."
1,Broke - now my wife is stressed,"My wife and I put forth the cash to buy a durable can opener that matched our kitchen appliances. We thought this Cuisinart Can Opener would last a few years! We were wrong. The can opener broke within 6 months. Now, we have a worthless piece of Cr@p and unopened cans. My wife is pregnant...its the holidays...and this is the last thing I wanted to deal with.I wish I would have saved my non-electric can opener!!"
3,Only last about 2 years.....,"We probably didn't clean it as much as we should have, but still......it only last for a couple years and then died! We are back to the standard hand crank openers, that just seem to work better and last as long as your hand does!"
4,Bodum coffeemaker,This is a great coffeepot! It is a pain in the rear to clean but then..who cares? If you LOVE>>LOVE>>>LOVE a great cup of coffee...then..this is the coffeemaker for you!!!!
2,Bodum 3000 Electric Santos,"overall, a disappointment. my 55 year old sunbeam coffeemaster makes better coffee with less work.the clear plastic shell with visible wiring, etc looks great from an industrial design point of view and puts on a great brewing show, but i have now confirmed that the electric santos brewing process is faulty as to providing an excellent brew. and what is with needing to change a nylon filter monthly that costs $5? for the price of the brewer, a permanent filter should be standard equipment. pot is hard to keep clean.my recommendation is to find a working sunbeam coffeemaster c30 model (available on eBay for about $30 shipped). if you need to view the brewing show, an older electric silex glass vacuum brewer may be for you. do a google on both those models and check them out..."
2,Short Timer,"We purchased this coffee maker due to good reviews and the intriguing design. It worked well for 1 year then the electronics gave out suddenly. Over 12 months it was used 5-7 times a week. Overall a very expensive, short lived novelty item."
1,Dangerous!,"Worked fine until handle broke off, spilling scalding coffee. Later, crack developed and rubber seal on bottom leaked. Contacted Bodum & got a lesson in runarounds. Gave up and bought an American Bunn VPR. Very superior and fast. Bodum is junk and DANGEROUS!!"
2,Weak Coffee,I bought this coffee maker from Starbucks about a year and a half ago(it was manufactured for Starbucks by Bodum). I read the instructions and watched the video. The first few pots of coffee were great. Better than the drip machine I was using at the time. By the third day of use the coffee started to taste weak. I discovered the coffee wasn't staying in the upper chamber as long as it had when I started using it. At first I thought this was just a fluke. Subsequent attempts resulted in the same weak brew. The water was staying in the upper chamber for less than a minute before the heating element would shut off and cause it to fall back into the pot.I ended up returning the unit to Starbucks for a refund and bought a Braun drip machine. Since then I've noticed Starbucks no longer carries this coffee maker.Perhaps Bodum has fixed the problems by now.
2,Great action - Poor flavor,"When I first saw this coffee maker, I was assured that the quality of the coffee was similar to a French press. The action of the pot is great, the flavor is not. In the coffee flavor there is a ""hole"". This may not be noticable to those who are not serious about their coffee, or to those who like a weak cup of coffee. At our house, we grind our beans, filter our water and always make our coffee fresh. We returned the pot after using it for one day. I was very disappointed, since this was the first automatic vacuum pot I had ever seen and the first vacuum pot I had ever used. The pot is very handsome, and I can't describe how sad we were that its coffee didn't live up to its looks."
4,Beneficial Science Experiment,"Great product, beautifully designed, a wonder of simplicity using gravity, our friend, to great advantage. Looks cool, gathers onlookers when under operation like the apes at the monolith from 2001 A Space Odyssey.Aesthetics aside, it makes a fantastic pot of coffee. With fresh ground beans, you won't get any better.The only thing that keeps me from rating it a perfect 5 out of 5 is that it's a pain in the butt to clean.But still very much worth it."
4,"It stays hot, it tastes good!","The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, thatthe pot itself is a bit hard to clean.You have to have one of those handled spongesto get in there. So how about 4 1/2 stars?? It shouldn't be a deterrent tobuying this machine. The coffee stays nice and hot for twohours AND doesn't get bitter like with other coffee machines.I could go on but I'm going to get another cup of (hot) coffee!P.S. You still have to buy good coffee it doesn't work miracles!"
2,Great coffee but a pain to clean,"I do feel this coffee has a better taste than my drip coffee maker. It is attractive, funky, and fun to watch. It is easy to put together and comes with good instructions. However, I hate cleaning the thing. The top part is dishwasher safe but will not fit in most dishwashers and would probably discolor over time. You lose the convenience of tossing out a paper filter with the coffee grounds. Now you have to scoop out the grounds! YUCK! The pitcher is difficult to clean. It uses twice as much coffee. I decided to return it. ..."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I absolutely agree with the various reviews that mention a ""weak brew"". I have tried several times to brew the minimum capacity brew (about 20 oz.) and have been tremendously dissapointed by the watery results. I have tried various grinds of coffee and various amounts of coffee -- all to no avail. I called Bodum and asked about removing the silicone ring on the base (as was suggested by other reviewers here on Amazon) but Bodum's replay was ""we don't recommend that"" and ""we're changing the suggested minimum brew volume to 6 cups.""Pros: looks cool, brews quickly, conversation pieceOther cons: difficult to clean (e.g. can't wash in dishwasher, disposing of grounds is much more difficult than with a disposable filter), expensive, takes up a lot of space"
1,Over-rated,"Let me start by saying that it broke after a couple months. I sent it back to Bodum who has a 3-4 week return policy. They didn't have any in stock for a month and half and now, 8 weeks later, they are shipping me a new one.This coffee maker puts on a show because it shoots the coffee up into the upper chamber. Once you realize that it's difficult to clean, uses an inordinate amount of grounds, and introduces the water into the grounds before it is completely heated, the show's over.Fun design. Poor function and customer service."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"If you read Amazon's introductory paragraph on this coffeemaker, it challenges the ad copy of many products claiming to be revolutionary, or really different. Well, the Bodum electric Santos really is different -- but is it any better than a standard drip coffee maker? In my experience, not at all. In fact, using the same blend of 8 O' Clock coffee, a friend made a tastier cup using a cheap Procter-Silex drip coffee maker. The only thing one can say positive about the Bodum is that it looks cool, and it is fun to watch. Otherwise it is harder to clean, it requires more coffee than equivalent drip coffee makers, and it costs about three times as much. In short, if you're the CEO of an oil company looking to spend your holiday bonus, the Bodum is your coffee maker. The rest of us can do much better for much less money."
2,"Nice design, poor coffee.........","After reading the positive reviews, I got one for my wife's birthday. We were really happy with the out-of-box experience. Until we made coffee. We tried about 6 pots varying grind, amount and which rubber gasket was removed.Honestly, I can't figure out what that was supposed to do anyway; the electronics are all in the pot with the heating element.Anyway, we sent it back. DisappointedOh, by the way, Bodum has apparently stopped shipping the 3000 with the cleaning brush....."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this machine after researching it for a long time. I could deal with the hard cleaning of it, I was willing to shell out $100.00 for a good quality maker, and I loved the design. After two or three uses it started to leak. After much searching I realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short. I paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly. I didn't return it, I just will NEVER buy bodum again."
1,Weak Coffee at its best!,"Except for the very first pot, the coffee has been extremely weak. It doesn't matter how many scoops we put in or brand we buy, it is always weak.I've read the reviews that say to find the silcon 'o' ring and can't find it anywhere. Their instructions and video say nothing about this ring. What is it? ..."
1,Sequana,"Bought it, tried it, hated it. The coffee it made DID NOT taste as good as what I made with my old Krups, even when I used twice the amount of coffee it called for. Also, cleaning it was a royal pain. I have a septic system, so I had to clean all the grounds out with a paper towel, etc. Now I know not to buy any maker that deosn't use a paper filter that I can easily toss in the compost. I'd give this a zero star if that was possible."
1,Where's the quality control?,"I had read the reviews before getting the Santos but I thought that the bad ones were aberrations. Unfortunately they were not. I tried brewing with the machine a half dozen times and it consistently resulting in weak, tasteless coffee regardless of the type and amount used. The apparent problem is that the water just doesn't stay in the brewing chamber long enough to really get the flavor - on some of my tries some of the grounds just stayed dry!I assume that some machines actually work well, because there are some good reviews, but it's a sad state when whether the one you buy is hit or miss. Quality control means consistency, not luck. Back it goes.(PS I tried the idea of removing the silicone band on the bottom of the base. Made no difference.)"
2,Great Coffee But Not Reliable,"We owned this coffee pot for about two months. We though we had died and gone to heaven. It made the best tasting and the hottest coffee of any coffee pot we had ever owned. Unfortunately, after two months we started to have problems with it leaking. We took it back to the store for a replacement only to find out that so had everyone else. They didn't sell them any more because they were getting too many returns. We have tried Mr. Coffee (horrible coffee) and Krups (they weren't much better). I sure do miss the thing."
2,Broken in less then one year,"We like the coffee from this machine, but after eleven months of use, it died! It was used probably four to five times a week, and well cared for by the family. I think for the price, a year lifetime is not long enough."
5,Revised Review,"I originally gave this pot a rating of 1 star but would like to change it to 5 stars. After a very minor correction, the Bodum-3000 now makes an excellent & rich cup of coffee. I had originally complained about its producing a thin, weak brew but have since discovered that this was due to the silicon band preventing contact with the heating base. It took 2 seconds to remove this band and the result is that the brewing process was lengthened by a couple of minutes. I could immediately taste the difference--what was once dishwater became GREAT coffee. Bodum contacted me by email & was extremely helpful, offering to do whatever it takes to satisfy me. So, I now enthusiastically recommend the Bodum Santos 3000, both for the wonderful coffee & customer service!"
1,a real disappointment!,"I waited for quite some time before ordering this coffeemaker due to the price. When I finally got it, it was a real disappointment. The seal at the bottom of the pot leaked after only two months, rendering the pot unusable. I tried to return it for a replacement to amazon.com, but was told it could not be returned after 30 days. Luckily the extremely kind people at bodum honored the warranty. I did not want another coffeemaker, since it was pretty obvious the problem would probably occur again. They replaced it with an electric kettle instead per my request. I have been very happy with the kettle, but I wish the coffeemaker would have lasted longer as I had high hopes for it."
2,"great coffee, poor pot...","I have been through 3 of these pots. They go bad before the warrenty even runs out. I love the pot, and love the coffee.. and I have found it does NOT take 11 minutes. Its faster then any pot I have ever used. I love this product, but I am glad it has a warrenty, because something seems to go bad on it far too often. Bodum works well with the customer, and has never hesitated to take back the pot and send a replacement.They give very good customer satisfaction, if they could only correct the problems."
2,clean...clean...and alot of cleaning...,I have this unit in blue.....very cool look and a great talk point at parties...It makes great coffee and its worth the money just to watch it but'..You have to use more coffee than othere coffee machines and the clean up is the WORST!!!!You can spend alot of time washing the unit because it's not like a drip coffee maker where you just throw the paper from the filter away and wash the pot quick...its just not worth the time...the until has a new home and thats the basement....back to the drip...and back to krups....bono out..
5,Bravo Bodum!,"I like everything about this machine--its sleek good looks, its ease of use, the show it puts on while brewing and best of all, the coffee it produces. Oh, the coffee is ambrosia! Dark, rich, aromatic and virtually free of sediment, it's one of life's little rewards."
1,disappointment by bodum,"like others, we loved the almost perfect taste of the coffee. however, after a year or less of service, the bottom seal began to leak and then the vacuum brewing was lost.too bad a.j. rathbun didn't use his for a year and then write his review. great idea, but no execution. perhaps bodum will get the message, or has reveived the message and will correct the flaws. a coffee drinker from san antonio."
2,"Have had 2, won't get a third","I bought the first one 3 years ago and loved the coffee it made although it takes twice as much coffee to get the flavor sought. It's impossible to really clean the pot. I tried using CLR and ruined the first one. I bought a replacement despite the high price. Yesterday the electronics in the pot died so now I've had two in three years, a lot of money to spend on a device to make coffee."
2,AMAZING in every way except...,"We bought one of these from the major coffee house after the manager (a friend) raved about it. He was right. It is so cool to watch this thing. And the coffee was absolutely the best my wife and I have ever brewed. It began to have numerous problems, and when I took it back, there were scores of them that had been returned.I was so dissappointed in the quality that I refuse to buy another, but man, I miss that thing."
2,thin and watery brew,"I purchased the Bodum on Feb. 3, and faithfully following the directions, I made my first pot using a 1-to-1 ratio of coffee to water. Result: thin, watery brew. Adding more coffee produced marginal improvement.I have not yet tried removing the silicon band (seems like it would have no effect)but I shall try that before I return the unit. I've noticed several reviews suggesting that as a remedy. Stay tuned..."
2,"Great Coffee, Very Bad Reliability",I initially bought this coffeemaker because I remembered my Dad's Sunbeam Silex type coffeemaker. It made great coffee and so does the Bodum. Problem with the Bodum is that I had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material. The folks at Bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem. I am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if I continue to have a problem.
