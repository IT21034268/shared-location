4,first 2 cd's are great,"I was able to preview this CD in Boston at a record store. You could only preview the first CD out of the three. I loved it so I picked up the set. The first CD is great, the second by Hardwick is excellent. They fall through a bit on the third CD, but overall this 3 disc set is worth your attention."
4,I DISAGREE WITH THE MAJORITY,"It looks like I am in the minority here. I have pretty much been disappointed by the Gatecrasher albums of the past. Thank God I found them in, ""used,"" bins, so the financial risk was low. I have always loved the first disc and then been disappointed by the other. The last,""Resident,"" three-disc set I found annoying but for the Matt Hardwick CD which I loved to death. I wasn't going to get this one. Then I figured that the Matt Hardwick disc alone would be worth the price. I like my music beautiful, lyrical and haunting, as well as danceable. I put on the first disc, just to get the Bond disc out of the way...imagine my surprise. I fell for it right off. It is beautiful, colorful and a treat for the head. I was blown away by the rhythms of it as well. It is a great find...and to think I almost didn't buy it! I'd have missed out."
2,Blase~.....Definitely Not Up to Par,"After hearing Resident Transmissions Vol. 1...I was very excited that Vol. 2 was already available. Then I got the 3 pack and was quite disappointed with it !! There are very few standout tracks on these 3 discs.....cd 2 is probably the best mix of the 3 but it lacks intensity throughout and falls back on the cheesy la la techno trance radio friendly [stuff] a bit too much for my taste. If you're accustomed to getting hard cutting, breakthrough songs (that's why I buy Gatecrasher anyway) then look elsewhere....they didn't arrive on this bus !! Save your money and pick up the new Saeed and Palash which is coming out later in July 2003 !! Or check out the new Deep Dish or In House We Trust Vol 2.....great stuff.....waaaaay more in tune with the club scene and waaaaay more danceable !!"
4,Good Quick Read,This novel was a good quick read. If you like historical fiction this is definetly a book I would reccommend. A truly remarkable tale of survival which is actually based on a true story. Very good read.
3,Not suitable for a novice,"As a novice, I found this book troublesome. While the information is very interesting for my Buddhist study, it offered me little practical help in my meditation practices. I do enjoy the text for its readings and explanations of the various schools of Buddhist thought. But I have found better texts and more helpful texts when it comes to instruction on personal meditation."
2,"10% Salmon Shark, 90% Other Alaska Wildlife","I was very disappointed in this video. I expected more documentary on the salmon shark. Instead, this video talked about jellyfish, sea otters, humpback whales, bears, glaciers, and eagles, even showing the humpback whales doing the bubble circle. Many of the shark scenes were repeated numerous times. I think I'm being generous saying 10% of this was about salmon shark. Great Alaskan wildlife documentary, not much salmon shark."
1,Not my best purchase.,"The 12"" King Celebrity Pillow Top Memory Foam Mattress Bed that I recieved feels NOTHING like the Tempur-Pedic Celebrity that I tried out (and fell in love with) in store. I am also disappointed in the quality of product, or lack thereof. The 80% price difference should have tipped me off. I'm wondering what the other reviewer's of this product, with their rave reviews, see in this product that I don't.This purchase reminded me of two things: 1)If it seems to good to be true, it probably is. AND 2)You get what you pay for.Not a big deal but worth noting: Fed Ex gave me the run around, but finally delivered product 2 weeks from the date of order."
5,Great value and comfort,i purchased this mattress in queen size and was suprised that it arrived in like 3 days....was concerened about spending $$ on unseen product but was thrilled that it was all i had wanted....very happy with purchase. this is the same as the 'celebrity bed' from Thermopedic which is about 7 times the cost.
2,Buy a better mattress...,"I was impressed when we first received this produce, though it did have a strong chemical smell, but now that we have used if for some time, I can honestly say rhat this product is worth LESS than what we paid for it. This mattress has not held up well and has already broken down so that it does not offer proper support. IF you want a memory foam mattress, I guess you had better pay more money for a better quality product or purchase a better conventional mattress. I paid approx $125 less than what is is advertised at now and if I know then what I know now, I would have not paid half of what I gave."
5,awesome bed,this is the most comfortable bed i have ever owned!!! i had the sleep number bed and replaced it with this bed. my husband and i absolutely love it!
4,"Beautifully shot, long suppressed Soviet drama","The story and characters are a bit thin; a female leader in the RussianRevolutionary army in 1922 is disgraced when she is found to bepregnant, and goes to live with a Jewish family, loses her hard shelland becomes a mother.But the black and white images are truly striking and impressive,especially the fantasy sequences. They give the story a much deeperpower and resonance than it would otherwise have.Especially impressive as a first film. this was suppressed by theMoscow authorities for 20 years for it's sympathetic view of Jews andtheir oppression in Russia, and the implication that the USSR wascomplicit in knowing about, and not trying to stop the concentrationcamps of WW 2."
5,the more things change the more things stay the same.,A collection of songs for our times.:) It is part of the when the sun goes down series and I was filling out the collection. Plus these included songs my Grandfather used to sing. It is a good series.
2,"good songs, poor re-mastering","Great sides, but as usuaual, record companies have no idea how to remaster shellac pressings. They make them sound muddy and life-less. They think surface noise will offend our ears more than the original music. They are supposed to sound bright, punchy with solid bass. I had a hell of a time pulling these out of the hole using Sound Forge."
5,DEFINATELY buy this CD!!!!,"i'd never heard of rebecca st james before i got this cd for my birthday and she is definately in my good books now!i thank you-a song of praise and thanks to God about how he providesExpressions Of Your Love- how we should actGod-very powerful (singing and lyrics!)Pray- very good song!Mirror- song about how we should try to mirror GodWait For Me- based on her book-beautiful lyrics and melodyYes, I Believe In God- i LOVE this track! its so inspriational and after reading 'She Said Yes : The Unlikely Martyrdom of Cassie Bernall' it was very inspirational.Stand- a song i'd love to hear sung at my church!Go And Sin No More- makes me think before i act |(most of the time!)A Cradle Prayer-a loevly lullaby. very nicethis album is very very goodencouraging and challengingi think that everyone who buys this CD will get something out of it. i know i did!"
1,stopped working after 60 seconds in the shower,"Looked & sounded great - until I turned the shower on, and immediately I could see moisture in the tuner/clock face. If I could give it zero stars I would. Now it doesn't work at all. Sending it back with a nasty note."
2,"Deserves credit for being outside the mainstream, but still not a very good album","An obscure modern blues singer with a portly, teddy bear-like physique, Donnie Ray recieved little fanfare with the release of this album, and unfortunately, it's not hard to see why. He does deserve to be applauded for not being the rapper or pseudo-balladier that many young black males are today, but his own musical talent is not too exciting. His singing is pretty substandard, the arrangements are repetitive and boring, and his semi-cover of George McCrae's ""Rock Your Baby"", entitled ""A Letter To My Baby"" should never have been made.Overall, not hate worthy, but many much better albums have been made."
3,New Ultravox Line-Up!,"The only original member is Billy Curie. It is an o.k. album but there is precious little in common with the original Ultravox sound. The title track is probably the best one and a good single but the overall feeling is ""who is this band?"""
5,smart people use smart tools,"I have been writting in a journal for over 40 years. I am not Hemingway or Chatwin but my journalling is important to me. Moleskine provides a perfact tool for journalling, note taking, doddleing and even keepsake holding. The small ones are best, you can put them in your pocket and take them any where, they can stand up to alot of travelling abuse. It's not difficult having a good idea it's just difficult remembering it. Moleskines are friends who remind you."
3,Not as good as I expected,"It's a useful product, but I think it's overrated. Some pens do bleed through a bit, but it's not that bad. Also, it looks like a Bible. I wish it would come in different colours."
2,Game,I bought this for small children to use at a fair booth we set up. The rings will not go over the stand when tossed unless you practically put them on. Too unstable. Does not work.
3,$$ tossed,"It's ok, but definitely not worth the price. The rings are made of light material which makes it hard to toss."
4,great swing music,"while I personally favor Anita O'Day's recordings on Verve (with Billy May and his orchestra) from the 50's, these early recordings she did with Gene Krupa fronting his Big Band from 1940-41, are classics, too. Her voice has not quite developed to the depth of perfection she would achieve later on, but her phrasing and and sound are still outstanding, and the arrangements, and playing of the musicians are superb. If you like Big Band, vocal music, or jazz, you will definitely enjoy this CD."
1,A poor substitute for the item shown,"The item that was shipped to me was a poor substitute for the item shown in the photo and described. What you get and what you order is the same item number, but what you get is of poor quality without the open straps that prevents binding behind your knees. Also the knee pads are shown to be formed, but they are just not of the quality of other McGuire Nicholas products that I have purchased nor are they what is advertised here. Save your money and buy something else."
5,"It looks kind of like a bible, but I really like it","This is really my first day planner since high school. I had a PDA for a while way back when, but I never really had much trouble keeping up with daily tasks until recently. So even though I am a huge nerd and thought about getting a new PDA I thought I would give one of these a try. I refer to it as my ""Personal Analog Assistant"" due to comments made in an episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.The paper is really nice, the size is great and it feels good in your hands. There is a series of reference info in the front (like conversions, time zones, etc.) and a removable address book in the back. There is even a small pocket that I have used to keep receipts and checks until I get them home.If you are on the fence about wheter to get one like this or just a cheap one I would suggest spending the little bit of extra money. This is compact, conveniant, flexible, stylish and sturdy. I think it's worth the extra few bucks."
5,Moleskine desk diary is tremendous!,"I cannot be happier with my calendar. I love the quality of the paper, and for the first time I've actually kept up with my dayplanning! Each day is given a whole page, and there's a nice little matching address book in the back pocket of the book. The quality of the paper is terrific, and the book fits together well and looks like a diary rather than a day planner. I love Moleskine, and this desk diary is perfect for me. One thing that you may or may not love is that the book is laid out more like a diary than a dayplanner. There are numbers running down the side of the page (staggered on every other line to account for half-hours), but it's not structured with lines of varying darkness and/or thickness, so it isn't laid out like your typical planner."
5,Moleskine's the best!,"I have been using Moleskine products for several years, and love them. I just went to the diary and I am glad I did. One drawback is the paper, while very nice, does not withstand some roller-ball or gel ink pens. There is a tendency to bleed through. Overall it is a great product."
4,Overall enjoyable reading.,"Every so often a BOOK comes along with a perfect mix of instruction, lore and stunning photography; this is it. Enjoyable reading."
5,Love Josh and Drake,"I sat with my son and watch Merry Christmas Josh and Drake after taping it last night. I have to say this was the first time I ever got tears watching these 2 guys. I thought it was very heart warming, and showed the true meaning of Christmas for young children"
5,"Merry Christmas, Drake and Josh!",I bought this for my nephew who loves Drake and Josh. I hope he enjoys the movie.
1,Tis' the season...,...to pass up on this movie!...it sucked!!!! I love Drake & Josh but this movie stunketh!...Merry Christmas!
2,You have got to be kidding....,My daughter is a hugh fan of Drake & Josh and we couldn't wait for this episode to air but it was so off the charts in an un-believable story line she asked us to turn it off and to watch something else.
2,plastic not rubber; needs clamp,these are plastic not rubber so I'm worried how they will hold up. had to buy a hose clamp to try & seal the bottom of the boot.
1,havent got it yet,seems silly but takes 2 and a half months to mail a disk to Canada. bet the Money gets collected over night
5,Fit my 3yr old son perfectly,"Bought these eye protection safety glasses for my 3yr old son to play Nerf guns. This way if he gets shot in the face, it won't hit his eye and I won't have people asking if I abuse my children! But seriously, they're high enough quality that unless he steps on the side they aren't going to break. The price is decent as well, I've got no regrets buying these glasses."
1,A seventh-graders dream; an adult's nightmare,"I first read these books when I was in seventh grade, and was captivated. I decided to reread these books as a break from graduate studies, and I have found the story to be lacking and the writing to be awful. The characters are highly emotional and the bestial descriptions -- e.g., Raistlin hissed and Tanis snarled -- get old quickly. It is no wonder that these books attract kids, for the characters' emotional levels are as solid as teens suffering through puberty. And if you have not read these books, I highly recommend to you not to listen to those who compare them with Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings."" Indeed, they are probably just as popular, but there is where the comparison ends. To site a friend of mine: these books are not even a scratch on the house that Tolkien built. But if you need something to do to pass the time while, say, riding a stationary bike, these books do just fine. They do not require much concentration."
5,Weis and Hickman score once again!,"This book is just as well written as the first book, and never has a sequel been written as well as the first since J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBIT. Dragonlance's most popular adventurers continue in their journey, this time in search of the dragon orbs, and the long forgotten dragonlances in which to destroy the evil dragons with of course. It makes you more familiar with Laurana, Gilthanas, and a handful of new characters, and I do suggest a box of tissues for the conclusion of the novel you're going to need them. I highly recomend this book to lovers of fantasynovels. To the Ignorant: Nobody thinks this is better than Tolkien, it's merely something to read besides the king of all fantasy's novels."
5,Dragons of Winter Night(Dragonlance Chronicles # 2),"I have enjoyed these books alot, they are well written."
1,How old are you?,"I read this series in 7th grade, and although it was very entertaining, I don't see how so many adults can be captivated by its simplicity. The writing style is very basic, the charactars are 2 dimensional, and the entire plot is full of insignificant events. Overall this series seems like a Dungeons and Dragons game which has been transferred to novel form. I'd give it no stars if I could."
4,My review,"This book as long as every book I have read from the DragonLance series is very good. I loved it, it kept my interest fully and I finished it in 5 days. Doesn't really leave much time for homework sadly. I highly recommend this book to everyone. As well as the whole series. One warning, if you get into books as much as I do...keep a box of tissues next to you while reading."
3,Best of the series,"This book ranks three stars because it was better than the other two in the series. The game mechanics were not in your face. I do not recall reading how Raistlin was forced to rest after casting a spell, or too often about the ""language of magic"". I also enjoyed the Bardic renditions, to a degree.There were still too many subplots, and the adventure overall is too grandiose. There were some cases where the plot was paper-thin. I would have preferred subtler foreshadowing, especially with a trilogy in which to unfold the story. If the authors have to tell me what's coming or how the characters feel, I don't feel that they have done their job.The best of a mediocre series."
3,"The Second Book, the First Chance to Commit","I have read the entirety of the standard Dragonlance ""saga"" (""Chronicles"" plus ""Legends"") twice through, along with the very important books ""Soulforge,"" and ""Dragons of Summer Flame."" I think the story of Dragon Lance itself is quite good. The only question is whether it makes up for the generally poor writing and simplistic characters.If you enjoyed the first book in the saga, you will probably enjoy this one. But bear in mind that the style only gets a bit better (and that is only because Tracy and Margaret have gotten over their ""first date"" fumbles in the first book). Also keep in mind that if you commit to this book you will essentially be forced to get the third one to complete the tale.If you have a youngster and are looking for a good gift for him, this is probably a good pick, as the simplistic (and idiotic) characters won't bother him as much."
5,An excellent fantasy novel in an excellent trilogy.,"Although these books aren't as good as Tolkien's ""Middle Earth"" series or Donaldson's ""White Gold Wielder"" series, they are very good all the same. The adventure the characters go on is an exciting one. The characters are interesting and likeable. If you're a D&D fan you'll appreciate these stories since they're based heavily on the game. You'll especially appreciate the various monsters that are accurate to the D&D rules (the blue dragon that breathes electricity, etc). I don't have too much else to say but if you like fantasy novels I recommend this highly."
4,"Winter Night, what?","I've always had a problem with the 2nd book in a triology, but even though this was the 2nd book, it was good. You need to read the other 2 to get the just of it though."
5,A great book for fantasy fans,"If you've read any of Weis and Hickman's other works (i.e. The Deathgate Cycle), then you probably know their prowess at writing enchanting novels that will hold any fantasy fan's attenetion. Dragons of Winter's Night is an addictive sequel to Dragon of Autumn twilight, and only serves to add exitement and intrigue to the story of Tanis and his companions. In the story, much is revealed about Kitiara's formerly shadowy character, but elaborating would ruin the story. If you haven't read Dragons of Autumn Twilight first, I'd suggest doing so, as it is the first book of this incredible series. I definitely recomment it for anyone with even a vague interest in such novels."
4,Great,"this was a wonderful book and I thought that it was really interresting. It was the most exciting book in the trilogy and you got to know the characters better, and find out who you liked and didn't. it was the worst book in the trilogy, but even that it really great, because it was just a great book"
5,Best one of the three...,"I'm a sucker for a sad ending, which means I'm usually a sucker for the 2nd book of a trilogy. This one does not dissapoint with its heart rendering conclusion. Expect to shed a tear or two over a beloved character who will go out with a bang. there's also much more to learn about each charachter, they all have their own trials and guilt. Some find out how weak they are and some find out how strong they are. And the dragons keep coming and they have to fight this war and man, the bad guys are really bad! Its fantasy in all its glory. You'll love this one if you liked the first. Enjoy!"
5,Simply the best!,"As with the other readers, I too was impressed with the change in Laurana (my all-time favourite fantasy character) in this novel. It seemed fitting that she was separated from Tanis in order for her to think for and rely on herself. The development of this character was amazing, the authors have put an awful lot of time and effort into this and I think it pays off wonderfully. Having done this, I don't understand why she isn't properly put to use in any other Dragonlance novels, other than Spring Dawning that is. I also liked the way so many different events took place in this book but the ultimate goal was still the same. My only opposing comment is that I think maybe there were too many bodies here. For example I don't think they should not have used Goldmoon and Riverwind. They were here only as plot fillers, they didn't serve a purpose like they did in Autumn Twilight. But this is just one negative aspect in a perfect masterpeace."
1,Same old thing,"YOUR NOT MISSING ANYTHING ITS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE AND DONE BETTER, PROBABLY WHAT DEFTONES OR VOD SOUNDED LIKE WHEN THEY FIRST STARTED THEIR RESPECTIVE BANDS, JUST NOT GOOD you have been warned!"
4,A radical looks at a conservative era,"This book, one of a series of collected material from his decades of writing, looks at a time of high tension, when the terror of nuclear war became real and the fear of the Soviet Union was used to justify a variety of questionable activities. Because he was an outsider and a leftist, his work had to meet a very high standard of research to be taken seriously. If you want to understand how the USA got to be the way it is today, these are vital documents.I.F. Stone, who was a thorn in the side of the American government for more than thirty years, was so hated by government officials and in particular the right wing in American politics that even in death has has been the target of attack, accused of being a paid agent of the USSR. It must be pointed out that he was, in the end, no friend to any government that held its own people in contempt, whether on the right or left ends of the political spectrum. Read this book (and his others) to find out why."
4,Useful and practical methods for a turnaround,"This book lays out some good, basic, and sound methods for turning around a problem organization. It should be called ""The Breakthrough Tactics,"" because it is not written at a strategic level at all.I work for an engineering/construction company. After reading the book, I have employed the author's method of identifying small areas for improvement to get momentum and build the confidence of a defeated organization. I have employed Schaffer's method to turn around a problem project, then restore a money-losing office to profitability.I heartily endorse this book. I am told by a friend who works at Siemens that the book is required reading for management there."
2,Brett does better in person,"So another White Party album... okay I'll buy it. You've heard these tracks before and maybe they are revised. Most are just okay and what is missing isn't the fault of the DJ, no the music this year isn't as catchy as in previous years. My toes tap but I forgot the tune shortly after I turn it off."
5,Dynamite,"I just got this cd yesterday. It consists of the best songs from the 1st Concord label 6 albums.My favourate songs are 'Its not for me to say', Yatra ta, cry me a river, Its all over now, infact all the songs are great. On the 2nd cd the live songs from the ""wild"" Also the ""U got me feeling"". The music is fulfilling, funky, dynamite, & out of this world. The lyrics are so good even in Portuguese language. U definately dont need any special brains to listen to any kind of music."
1,Not Much Staying Power,I read about these in Runner's World and how great they were at staying in place in your hair. This is not true - I never tested them while running but just walking around the house caused them to slip back on my head so I can't even imagine how frustrating they'd be running.
1,wynton marsallis fiddlers tale,i had heard the fiddlers tale on the radio and ordered the mp3 recording. this was not the music i had heard on the radio and i dont like it nearly as much. this was purchased from amazon.
3,"Pretty Good radar, poor holder","Just to make it simple, the internal clip that attachs the product to the metal holder (and then to the windshield), went loose after 2 days of use. Probably it has a plastic clip inside while the windield piece is metal.Radar itself works great."
3,"Adequate radar detector, batteries and a charger optimize convenience","(NOTE: this product was reviewed when the price was $99.) Not the greatest RD out there (many recommend the Escort 8500, 9500, or Valentine V1 as the top picks), but for the price, what can you expect. You can expect some false alarms, mediocre sensitivity, and some basic features and adjustments. I bought this for the ability to do away with a cord (making the RD a bit larger and heaver), and an included AC charger that you can take with you on trips. In spite of its sensitivity (i.e. the lack of filtering out false alarms from various sources), it does alert me to real law enforcement measurement devices. Since I use this simply for informational purposes (I rarely travel > 5 MPH over the legal limit), this is fine. For those who wish to daringly exceed posted, lawful limits on a regular basis, I suggest a higher-rated device -- for hundreds $ more, naturally. And have a good lawyer."
5,Radar detector = the jam,"For the price, this radar detector is awesome. No wires, comes with battery/car charger, numerous settings. Costs less than a ticket and will quickly pay for itself."
1,Don't bother,"Got a ticket for 53 in a 35. Never heard a single beep. I understand that this is not a high end detector and I also understand that the cops don't always just leave their radars on. So I knew that I wasn't ""bulletproof"". But what I would expect of any radar detector is that even if I do get pulled over that it would at least beep at SOME POINT whether before or after I've been ""shot"" with the radar.Now, let's assume that you think this is a fluke and you decide you want to get it any way. Here's something else you may want to consider. You can't hear it. If you drive with your windows down and/or play your music at anything above average levels, you won't be able to hear it go off. It does light up when it detects something which is helpful but even with the volume all the way up, it's pathetically hard to hear."
4,Good value,Cordless rechargeable feature is great. Adjustable settings you'd only find on higher end models. Alarms are easy to hear and recognizable even with the radio up. As a radar detector my old Belkin 955 was more reliable and detected the Ka signal much further away.
3,Radar detector,"It's bulky, and the rechargeable batteries didn't work well, have to use the cord or unit don't work."
4,DE1788 RADAR DETECTOR,I HAVE USED THIS NOW FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND FIND THE BATTERIES WERE NOT STAYING CHARGED VERY LONG.I PURCHASED GOOD RECHARGEABLE BATTERYS AND NOW IT WORKS A LITTLE LONGER.ALL IN ALL IT LETS YOU KNOW WELL IN ADVANCE WHEN TO SLOW DOWN.I ESTIMATEDED ALMOST A MILE.ALOT BETTER THAN MOST.THE UNIT DOES JUST GO OFF SOMETIMES BUT THAT IS IN THE SETTINGS AND YOU WILL GET USED TO THAT.FOR THE MONEY YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
3,product ok but seller will not take a return,"I thought this was one with voice. It wasn't. I tried to return it to ANTOnline, but they would not take return because I had to cut the packaging it was in to get it out. How are you suppose to get it out of the packaging wihtout cutting the plastic? I am really dissappointed with the seller of this item. PLEASE don't order from them if you aren't going to keep it because if you can't find a way to get it out of the plastic, they will not give you a refund!!!!!"
3,eh,"Since I bought this album I heard Mark say that Pilgrim Highway is kind of incongruous with the rest of the material on this album- I bought it thinking it would all sound like that track, generally. But this is the western swing album he made, with the one folky, acoustic hymn at the end. hmmm. I'd also like to know what album Ghost is on, I can't seem to find it listed anywhere. This album is OK but not in the vein I was expecting."
4,"so far, so good","I've cooked once in this slow cooker, and it turned out very well. It is a little odd that the insert doesn't have a tighter fit in the crockpot, but it doesn't seem to affect the performance. It is attractive, seems to work well, and was very easy to clean."
2,Good but flawed,"I received my Euro-Pro last April and have used it several times in the slow cook mode. It worked great and I loved the ability to program the time. BUT, yesterday I needed to cook something faster so I put it on high and much to my disappointment, after about 45 minutes, it turned to keep warm and that was it. I then tried on medium heat and it did the same thing. I will send it back because it is still under warranty, but that is a pain and I will not have the use of it until it is replaced. I would buy another one, because I like the size, the various temperatures and the ability to program it. I hope they have the bugs out when I receive the next one."
1,Started smoking,"The first time i used this product it was wonderful and worked perfectly. On the second use the controls were acting strange by not responding well or just turning off. By the 3rd use the control panel started smoking. This cooker was not mistreated, there was no overspill and when cleaning i did not get the electronics wet. A family member has the non electronic version of this and it works perfectly so i would suggest if you like this brand to purchase the manual control unit."
5,not so bad for a B movie,"Tiana Alexandra (real name Tran Thi Thanh Nga, The Killer Elite, From Hollywood to Hanoi) is a sexy femme fatale here as ""Checkers"", with some decent acting and skilled, fantastical kicking technique. The male police leads play their comic roles effectively. Rod Steiger draws a paycheck as the lead bad guy; Harold Sakata (""Oddjob"") plays a thug who tries to kill Checkers---and gets bashed by a prop ironing iron among other things (at least I hope it was a prop!) 5 stars is my rating, primarily for the beautiful Ms. Alexandra in her ""Cinderella Pu"" get-up. Although she may have left action work for more serious projects (From Hollywood to Hanoi, racial attitudes in Hollywood writings, etc.), she'll be remembered."
4,Not what I expected from 'vegas' but definitely good!,"I've been waiting for this CD for over a month and have to say that I'm happy with it. Since buying it yesterday I've listened to it 2 times so far and the songs are growing on me. I like 'home again' the best along with 'Walk into the Sun' and 'Given you everything'. The vocals are great, the melodies kind of sound alike in some songs, but the overall quality is worth buying the CD. Great CD to pop in if you're having people over or if you're in the car. To me it's more of a Pop-type album then techno/house. Just by listening to this CD I'm assuming we'll be hearing a couple of these songs on major radio stations very soon."
4,Most Reviewers Off Base On this Record.,"If you only read Rolling Stone and the first review in the Amazon section for this record, you would never buy this CD like I almost did not do. However, it is obvious, they only listened to one track on the previous record, ""Days Go By.""Otherwise, they would know what this band is about and appreciate that this record is a continuation of their first record and quite consistent. For those listeners who enjoyed ""Days Go By,"" don't be scared away, there is plenty of listening material here for you and then some. It is hardly a ""guitar laden record that some may imply."" Other bands may wish to strive to get to this band's level."
3,"Don't Miss the Single Version of ""... Sun""","I bought this on the strength of the single ""Walk Into the Sun"" but this CD does not contain the radio edit thereof. So I also bought the CD single of that and I have played it to death. ""One"" is pretty good. The strongest cuts in my opinion are ""A Million Ways"" and ""Given You Everything"". I'd like to see these guys minimize the whimp factor in future efforts and concentrate on rocking/trancing out. The intro of ""Closer"" made me double check that I hadn't put on my Bread's Greatest Hits CD. With apologies to David Gates..."
4,An interesting departure for their sophmore studio album!,"After listening to this album twice, I have to say WOW! I really enjoyed Dirty Vegas' debut album, after first hearing Days Go By in the UK and then in that darn car commercial. The first album was very electronic and dance-oriented. The new album has more of a rock feel to it, while retaining that cutting-edge sound that we've grown to love from the Dirty Vegas boys. It's almost as if the boys have grown up a bit having toured arond the world and their sound has matured because of it. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed their first and is interested in continuing the journey!"
1,Never Purchase This!,"I've purchased this product in January. Since then, I've had some problems with the sound quality. I got this replaced a month after, and I still had the exact same problem, which means that the problem would be evident in every product. I cannot recommend this product to anyone. When it's playing MP3 discs, it would frequently make this weird and loud hissing noise in the middle, which I found extremely frustrating and annoying. Furthermore, this product is fragile unlike other 'skip-proof' products. This product is a battery drainer. A fresh, newly-charged NI-MH battery would only last about 3 hours on this product. So I don't know if this will be a choice for anyone. From using this product, I vow myself to never buy any Panasonic product again."
2,Way too country !,When your expecting something like The Hellecasters you will be realy disappointed with this C.D. Only a couple of songs sounded like the Casters the rest was Way Too Country !
1,not much of a movie,i watched this movie didnt have a very good story line and the effects where horrible it looks like some little kid cooked this up in the back yard im shure that my six year old cussuns could do better i felt like i waisted my money on it.
3,"Beenie Be Cool, Me Want More Angie","Beenie Man has seen sudden recognition for his efforts to bring Reggae into the 21st century. He has the momentum to soon be making Top 100 songs and albums in the US. This single features rap by Angie Martinez, a rising East Coast rap artist. She has also guest-starred on recent albums by Kid Capri and Krs-One. The collaboration which is presented here is yet another great achievement by both of these artists. Perhaps they will soon be recognized for thier hard work and dedications. The only problem with this CD is that it is a single rather than an album."
5,thought it would be awful... who ever heard of healthy mexican food,I grew up on my mom's home cooked mexican food. I purchased this book for her because she is always looking for healthy foods to feed the family. I honestly thought it would be terrible but since I'm married and out of the house I wouldn't have to suffer (bad I know). I was pleasantly surprised when I made the pozole which even my husband loved. I have also tried some of the mole and chicken recipes... they are all very good. There are many pictures in this book and none of the dishes I have made require any strange equipment. The ceviche recipes also look good. It has given us new ideas for dinners at mom's house on Friday nights.
3,Another recommendation,"I find the subject of the historicity of Jesus to be absolutely fascinating. Joseph McCabe's Myth of Ressurection is an interesting and scholarly work, but if you want a truly insightful and profound book check out Earl Doherty's The Jesus Puzzle. Doherty basically focuses on the ""conspiracy of silence surrounding the Paulian epistles. He questions why Paul makes nary a mention of the deeds, life, and sayings of Jesus. His conclusion is simple yet surprising: Paul wasn't writing about a human Jesus but rather a mythical Jesus similar in scope to the ""savior gods"" which he learned about in his youth. I guarantee by the end of Doherty's arguments, you'll be thinking as I did: ""Damn, why didn't I think of that.""Read it, and then if you want you can check out McCabe's take on Jesus."
4,Chronic Future know how to party,"The Collins brothers from this band had a party at their house once, and let me tell you, that scene was crazy. There was more grass there than on all the green plains of Ireland. I mean, really, it got to the point where no one knew what the hell was going on, we were all so bombed.P.S.: The trampoline was pretty cool too."
3,this book was more about his poltics then wrestling,I wanted to read more about his years in pro wrestling then his years in the goverment if you are a wrestling fan this book is ok its more for the politcs
4,The truth is all I care about and Jesse has delivered,Great book the first I read in a while the Gov is honest and that is all we care about career politisions suck big time we needed this new blood and we got it its time for change its time for the people to take back the state I will never again vote for either dem or replub. His book is great he does not hide or lie about his past he is what he is and that is all that he is and I tip my hat to him he is a true minnesotain and so am I.. Thank you Jesse you have put the faith back in me and yes the American is still alive in minnesota...
1,"""Hoo-Yah"" is ""YAHOO"" backwards....","I'm sure this book pleased Jesse when somebody read it to him. The rest of us, however, are just plain frightened. Do we really need to know why the Gov doesn't wear underwear? Do we really need to know about his exploits with prostitutes? It's like electing the class bully. I only hope he has someone smart doing his homework for him.If you like Rush, if you like Howard, you'll LOVE Jesse.If nothing else, this book might make you re-think the idea of letting 18 year olds vote."
2,Won't satisfy wrestling fans or political junkies,"""I Ain't Got Time to Bleed"" was pretty bad. It was mildly entertaining, but less so than the very funny, ""Have a Nice Day,"" by Mick Foley. It had virtually no informational value as a book about politics. Basically, Ventura devotes a little space to different phases of his life without getting into too much detail about any of them. He tells few wrestling stories, no war stories, and devotes only a few pages to his campaign for governor. He devotes a bit more space to a somewhat vapid discussion of his positions on issues. All in all I cam away from the book with less respect for the idea of Jesse Ventura as governor, but more interested in the story of what's going on there in Minnesota. The real story is still waiting to be told."
1,This Book Scares Me,"I knew that this guy was not all there, but this book confirms it. He has a very weak way of explaining a story and some of the life stories he explains are rediculous. Good Luck MN!"
1,Wrasslin man,"This high-school book releases the inner bore of its over-sized author. Someone, pullleeeez, turn him off."
1,"Bring Back Verne Gagne, Please","What this book lacks in depth it makes up for in banality. Actually, Jesse has inspired me to be honest, just like him: The book is stupid, not banal. He reminds me of some sweaty wrestler mugging like a monkey in front of the camera. And get this--the guy's the governor of a real state!"
4,His book boils down to seven easy letters: H-o-n-e-s-t-y,"""There's a great need in our government right now for honesty."" -- So says the Governor of Minnesota at the beginning of his autobiography.Well, what this book lacks in depth and substance is made up for in the author's unabashed, honest accounting of his life. A refreshing, captivating read throughout, both the high and low points."
5,Jesse Ventura is an inspiring role model.,Jesse Ventura has done what most Americans have not. He has lived his life demonstrating who he is. He is 100 percent himself. There are no lies and no regrets. Total honesty with himself and others. What a freedom that is! This book is very inspiring to read. It has helped me to be more honest with myself. Thank you Jesse!
2,"an infomercial, but interesting","of course its basically an infomercial, but its got some meat. a nice read. the message I found most appealing is what a person can accomplish if they are fearless (or just embrace what they fear)."
2,"Heard the political spin before, but the man is interesting","The book is interesting in that it provides a valuable insight to one of our nation's governors. For those of us who only knew Jesse Ventura as a flamboyant ""wrestler"", we were exposed to much of the rest of his life experiences -- Navy Seals, Mayor, Sports Talk Show. However, Ventura's proclamations remind one of the Ronald Reagan simplistic message -- lower taxes, raise defense spending and balance the budget. The criticism regarding what Governor Ventura chose to reveal about his personal life is laughable. I'm not sure if he was bragging or if he is smart enough to have done a pre-emptive strike. But had he not told us about his background, no doubt someone would have sooner or later. A quick read, and, while not spellbinding, he is Governor."
4,The pans from the elitist snobs kill me,"I just finished the book. Jesse is just a regular Joe who's not ashamed of his past and lays it all on the table.So what if it's not ""War and Peace""?The book is a good, quick read if you're in touch with reality. Avoid it if you're the type who's offended by mild nudity in magazine bathtub ads."
4,Ventura is the man!,"Although I don't agree with all of Jesse's political opinions or life choices, I can respect the man for his honesty. Some of the things in life he brushes off with ""that was the way things were back then"". Well, that may be true, but that doesn't mean that they are right. The fact that he does detail those not so flattering times earns him my admiration. The book reads easily and is well worth the price if your fed up with ""politics as usual""."
4,No Nonsense Governor!,"An interesting new (and the way it should be) approach to goverment, his ideas make sense. Hopefully, more politicians can be as honest as him. He tells it like it is, regardless if you like it or not. The good old boy politicians now have someone to fear."
2,Or to write a decient book.,"Stick to Politics or Wrestling Jesse, coz you can't act and you definately can't right (He thinks coz Arnie thinks he's a good actor it must be true) Don't waste your hard earned money on Jesses Liberal drivle, Ted Dibiase would be better, or if you want a decient read try one of Mick Foley's Books."
4,A fresh look at today's politics and future goals,"Ventura's book was as much of a political tool as it was an open account of why he believes in what he does. Instead of telling us what he believes, like most politicians do, he tells us through his life story *why* he believes that, which most politicians don't. He is refreshingly honest, which you can do nothing but admire. He has chosen to admit that he has had the same experiences as we ""normal"" people. Though some of the book seems like a cheap way to get in the last word with some of the people he has had differences with, the majority was outstanding, fresh, well-written (for someone who has never graduated from college), and overall a good read."
1,Minnesota Embarassment,Do you actually think that he wrote this book? The guy cannot even put words together to make a coherent sentence. Jesse is cashing in on his 15 minutes of fame rather in doing his job. The only person more surprised then the people of Minnesota is Jesse Ventura that he was elected Governor!
1,Putting money in Jesse's pocket,"90% of what interests Jesse is what personally benefits his pocketbook. This book is no exception. Many of us in Minnesota are embarrassed and not very happy to be paying for his publicity tour for this piece of junk. Of course, Minnesota has a long history of electing weird politicians."
1,Bag o' Wind,"The book was written by a ghost-writer and was still poor. When people like this big-mouth ignoramus get elected to state office, you know it's about all over. Truly depressing. His book now costs one cent, and it is still over-priced."
2,An improbable governor,"Jesse Ventura has had an interesting life, and he wants to tell you about it. He has been a US Navy SEAL, a professional wrestler, and surprisingly, a Governor of Minnesota.Ventura is a six feet four inches tall and has been an athlete for a long time. He seems to be physically imposing. However his autobiography makes him seem like an intellectual light weight. He became Governor as part of the Reform party. Ross Perot had caused a surge of interest in an alternative to the Democrats and Republicans.Despite having served as a Governor he offers us few political insights. We learn that there are too many laws, and that people need to be responsible for themselves. I don't think we needed Jesse for that. You would think a political outsider might be able to offer some fresh perspective. The only thing I found surprising about the book is that Ventura seems astonished by gotcha journalism. What did he expect?I was hoping for more. In the end there is nothing much to the book."
3,This book is a quick read poorly written yet captivating.,"It's a simple book with a story of a small town average Joe who becomes a success. Jesse Ventura states many times in the book he thinks every step his life has headed was controlled by fate. He never tried to be in politics, he just ended up there. I liked the first part of the book when Jesse tells of his childhood and his life as a Navy Seal. The second half dwells more on his political life and unorthadox style of campaigning.....he actually told the truth. Ventura sounds like the average citizen who is upset with the local politics and used his fame from wrestling to get him elected to be the Governor of Minnesota. This is an inspirational story which proves anybody can be anything when you strive for you dreams."
5,I was waiting for this moment for so long !,"I am a big fan of Jesse Ventura since the early 70th. This book is the couronnement of his carrer. Love it or hate it : But everybody has his own opinion about this book, and this is the key for a best-seller. Don't buy this book for litterature : Buy this book for spirit !"
4,"Upfront, direct, and no nonsense.","This autobiography is very entertaining, and this man will make a good public servant because he is willing to STAND UP for what he believes, no matter if everyone agrees with him or not. I recommend it, although he goes in depth about his childhood which might not have been so necessary. I understand he only wrote THAT in depth because he wanted the public to know where their governor comes from."
4,A book for Jesse fans and believers in the American Dream,"This is an entertaining and easy read if you are a Jesse Ventura fan. If you had limited knowledge of Jesse prior to his governorship the wrestling chapters would be hard to follow. As a fan of wrestling and a believer in the American Dream it is a very enjoyable and thought provoking book. For those reviews that highlight Jesse's ego, they are right, it takes an ego to stand-up and achieve what Jesse stood up and achieved. Perhaps it requires more egos to ""shock the world"". Lord knows our government continuously shocks us with obsurdities, maybe we need to show that a ""vote"" is still a powerful force in shaping our countries destiny."
5,"An EXCELLENT book about life, politics and being REAL","The Body has written an excellent book! A definite must-read! Integrity, self-reliance and getting back to being real! The public wants to hear from a politician that cant be bought, one that is honest and has integrity! I highly recommend it if you have ever thought about how things could change within the government. Jesse has the answers, and you know what? They're simple and you think to yourself ""Isnt THAT the way things are SUPPOSED to be running the government??"""
2,"Concentrate on the book, not the man","As literature, this book is awful, the kind of thing that one leaves behind in the seat of an airliner wihtout regret. I don't know that it reveals much about the Governor of Minnesota except that he seems to enjoy his own hyperbole.So far as the man is concerned, I certainly favor Mr. Ventura over Garrison Keillor in their feud. Mr. Keillor has spent his entire life engaged in essentially frivolous endeavors, and yet he seems to feel that his opinions should matter - why?I think that, by now, all American voters should be be very wary of embracing false prophets. Politics has become show business, and Mr. Ventura is very good at show business. I recall that voters in Weimar Germany got tired of professional politicians in the 30's, and wanted a change - they certainly got one."
4,eff the naysayers,"If you are a fan of the delay sound buy this product. 4.5 stars. Ive had it for about 2 weeks and its starting to interfere with my personal life. Any free moment I have all I want to do is go play with my new toy.I cant say if the dl4 sounds exactly like the products its trying to emulate(never owned an echoplex, space echo, etc) but I can say it sounds GREAT. Super quiet when plugged in thanks to true bypass. Endless sounds . . . dial into the reverse delay and you feel like Jimi!The only bad reviews Ive read are by people that dont even own it(I think they just bitchy too) My only complaint is that I dont have hours and hours of free time to truly delve into this pedal . . .but thats not Line Sixs' problem.The construction seems really solid . . .Ive had 0 problems so far.So in my humble opinion, anyone that likes delay and has 225$ to spend should buy this . . .you will not be dissapointed."
5,VERY SEXY MOVIE!!!,"If you like movies like LA DONNA LUPO,THE DREAMERS or CLOACA,this is your movie.Anna(GRY BAY) is very hot in this movie, there's one scene where she is painting a room wearing nothing but a shirt.The sex scenes are explicit and there's even some oral sex.One of the best scenes is where she is spread over a table by her former lover but my only complaint is that it's slightly dark.Don't think it's just about sex either,the story is very romantic and your girlfriend might enjoy it(If she doesn't mind the sex scenes)also,the black bars in the pictures are not in the movie.The 3 Disc Set is beautifully made and it even comes with a booklet full of photos.A great addition to any collector of the Emmanuelle 3 Disc Set."
1,Lousy,"would never order this type of film again, wasn't what I expected, very disappointed, to say the least., a warning to others"
4,Pretty Nice PPs,"This movie was pretty nice in its use of sexuality in a cinematic production. There were not too many erotic sex scenes but when their was, you could tell that actual penetration was involved. No big close-ups and a simulated money shot leaves your hand all tired for nothing, but regardless, rubbing one out to this movie can be easily accomplished due to the main characters perfectly shaped breasts. Good story but wish it showed more...."
3,softcore porn or ?,"It is softcore porn, I watched the directors cut first, it's junk. Was wondering what the release version could be like and it was good. Girlfriend liked it as well."
1,what a piece of junk,"I don't understand the high ratings for this movie. Cult my nose. It's a PORN movie, with bad acting, no dialogue. It's a masterpiece of garbage. we need minuspoints here."
5,Fun for all,We just love this book. My 7 year old son received it for his birthday and my husband and I could not put it down. Looking for the clues on each page and trying to solve the mystery was alot of fun for all of us.
5,MUST HAVE FOR TEACHERS,"Being a primary teacher, I thought this book would be too difficult for my students. But in reality they LOVED it! Every day at Shared Reading time, they begged to hear it again and again. My gifted students would study the illustrations and clues over and over again. They would work tirelessly to figure out the hidden codes and messages. This book lasted an entire semester in discussions in our classroom. I highly recommend it for many reasons, not only the ones I listed above, but the detailed elaborate illustrations and rhyming rich colorful language are priceless! Whether you are a parent of children or a teacher of children, every child should experience the Eleventh Hour!"
5,Eleven years worth of reading enjoyment!,"I can't say enough good things about this book. It is filled with amazingly detailed pictures bursting with clues to help you solve a remarkably fun mystery. I have owned this book for eleven years, and I still cannot solve the final puzzle. I fear I'll start losing sleep if I never figure out the name of the Swan... If it were permitted, I'd give the book eleven stars. Buy this book!"
4,"Pretty cool,but hard.","Greame Base has written a wonderful book with elegant pictures. Readers in the age range of 9-13 usually enjoy it most. Littler kids can enjoy the pictures, but have a hard time solving the mystery. I was awarded this book for a poster of the rainforest I drew for a contest in 1994.It took me a long time to solve the mystery.I still haven't found all the mice.I recommend Graeme Base's other book, Animiala."
5,Best 11 year old bday present,"We order this book in bulk and give it to all of our friends for their eleventh birthday. It is a great book visually and to solve the mysteries with their family.Jefferson, Ga"
5,"Take the time and ""do"" this book. It's amazing!","When Horace turned eleven, he arranged himself a birthday party at his stunning house. He invited eleven friends to his party, and made an eleven course feast for them to eat at eleven o'clock, after playing eleven games. But after the eleven games are played, they return to eat the feast, but it has vanished. You are invited to turn back the pages, and look in the pictures for clues to find out which of the guests was the guilty one. I first saw The Eleventh Hour at a friend's house a few years ago. I was tatally amazed at how many codes and details could be packed into so few pages! The pictures, though, were beautiful nontheless! And even though there were so many codes and puzzles, it was still really difficult to figure out who-done-it. This book is a masterpiece for anyone who enjoys mysteries, puzzles, or Graeme Base's books, and I recomend it to nearly anyone."
5,Graeme Base is GREAT!,"I've come across many Graeme Base book and this is one of my two favorites (the other Animalia). I love puzzles and logic, so this was so fun!"
5,A Fun Mystery for Most,"I discovered this book in the classroom where I work. I do not think it is a great book for many children below a certain age, because my co-workers and I were having a time figuring things out in this book. This just shows, however, that their is entertainment value for a very wide range of ages! Graeme Base did another wonderful job with this book!"
5,A Curious Mystery...,"Grahame Base is a genius. This is a great book, not just for kids but for adults as well. It has everything, mystery, intrigue, comedy, and anything else you want. Each page is BEAUTIFULLY illustrated. It's pages are filled with clues, to help you solve the mystery. I know who did it and I still have fun decoding messages, and searching for the hidden pictures on each page. It's wonderfully worded, parents will have as much fun reading it as their children will. It's hard to find enough words to do this bool justice. This is a great book from a steller author/illustrator."
3,Practically impossible,"Base has given us his usual gorgeous spreads of illustrations, and an amusing mystery tale starring costumed animals. I guess some older kids and adults will really get into trying to solve the mystery and searching for the obscure clues, but honestly, when I finally read the answers in the back I was dismayed. How is any child supposed to find or figure out any of these obscure ciphers, or avoid all these red herrings? And who wants to sit around finding ""one hundred and eleven mice"" that are hidden throughout? If your kids want a lavish mystery picture book about animals, they might prefer ""Piggins"" by Jane Yolen, which might not involve hours of searching, but which tells a similar story and won't be so frustrating. Base is a little too clever for his own good."
5,Loved this album!,"This album is what the title says. Very romantic... famous love melodies that you know, but with more of a beat and sound of modern style. I listen to friends CD once in car when here on vacation, and liked very much. I spent the rest of time driving everyone crazy because I kept playing it at the house too much (but they still sang with me!). Original songs very nice also, with beautiful voice and words.I was just visiting to USA and i will very much love to order CD to own also (the songs made me homesick but happy!). My friends say they have seen this singer live and that the show was very great and had fun. I look forward to seeing this singer maybe too- I hope my CD is at my house waiting when I go home in a week! Thanks to 'Donadi' and come to our town soon! Love, Your new fan!"
3,A nice rocker,"Not an unpleasant album, but it doesn't break any boundaries. Be aware that I don't think that the Michael Knott here is the same one from LSU - a mistake I made."
3,cheap,My dog likes these bones just fine but they seem to be pretty cheaply made and they are not all smooth. For some reason there are rough pieces that look like they have string or something running through them.
2,SUPER SMALL BONES!,"This bones seemed like a great deal but I should've known when they said ""mini"" that they were INCREDIBLY SMALL! I have a 20 lb small dog who loves bones but he devoured these in five minutes. If you have a dog who eats bones really slow then they might work OK but I would go with something a bit bigger."
2,Missing Title Track on this CD version.,"This was a real disappointment. My favorite song on this album was the title song INTERNATIONAL. For some reason that track is omitted on the remastered CD that I just purchased. It was replaced with a track called THE MEDLEY, which was not on the original vinyl release. Since the track order has also been rearranged it would seem that it should have been released under another title - especially since the Title Track from the album was not included. Perhaps there was a legal issue with that particular song and it couldn't be included due to a 'rights' dispute. It still felt a bit like 'bait and switch' since the CD retained the title, but didn't include the corresponding title track."
5,Bach: The Toccatas,"Bach: The Toccatas is a recording with the brilliant Angela Hewitt playing Bach's Toccatas on a piano and not on an organ. The sound quality is superb and Hyperion Recordings have done a great job. The booklet contains great liner notes by Ms Hewitt and these are available in English, French and German. Angela Hewitt is a piano virtuoso and one of the better pianist interpreting Bach and whilst not up to the standard of Glenn Gould it is better then most. 5/5."
3,Did not like it at all,I really did not like it at all. It looks like all the magic that Gould did put in those pieces is gone. Gould's interpretation is an introspective journey in a music that seems to be just born under his fingers.A total dispointment after reading other reviews.
2,"Good, average...","All things considered, this performance is far less impressive and interesting than Gould's. Counterpoint lacks, very quiet and smooth playing, no flagrant and uprising dynamics shifting. No take offs, no surprise. Ideal as muzak, in elevator or restaurant."
5,Great book for learning Java,"As mentioned before, this book is not a reference, but rather a 'learn Java from the ground up' text. It is a very good 'hold-your-hand' text that eases you into Java. I actually enjoyed the overly-thorough explanations when I used it a couple of years ago. I had to use a piece of trash Drozdek DS&A book for school, and I'm now wishing that I had Malik's C++ version of this book by my side during that course."
1,Bad Java Book,"I ordered this book, because it is required by my University. But this book is not for beginner nor experience.I think the author of this book forgot that, he suppose to write his book to readers not himself. He uses some file in his example that is not in the book without even mentioning where the file is located ( which is in the source code folder). I was pulling my hair to figured out where the intClass in his example7.7 of chapter7. Final by curiosity I went and look at the source code file to find the class was sitting there. how can he expect us to be in his shoes if we are just learning the language. He would take two to three pages just to explain something like (you need to improt java.util.Scanner) in order to use the Scanner class.I end up buying Tony Gaddis book to read and come to his waste of money book to do the homework. If is not required by your institution, do not waste your dollars in this pieces of pages."
1,Book Review,"I have never received the book that I ordered so, I really can not review it. Apparently, the book was lost in transit. Amazon did refund the money for it + shipping costs."
2,Synth Pop silliness!,"Ok, I like this album. Well, I like more than half of it. As has been said, don't even bother comparing this record to other ministry releases unless you have an overdeveloped sense of irony. Euro-synthesizer pop is what you'll find on this disc, and while a number of the songs are quite catchy, this is pretty much their only saving grace. Good for a laugh, good for the history. Pick this one up if you think you'd get as much a kick out of hearing Al Jourgensen sing like a complete pop-arse-kissing wimp as I did."
5,pedal,este wah es el mejor wah que e oido en mi vida se oye muy bien es de el mejor material bueno y para que los use hendrix y otro debe ser muy bueno
5,Built like a brick,"I had the original Cry-Baby back in the '70's and was very happy with it. I recently bought another and was just as pleased. They are still well built units; solid, heavy, killer wah-wahs."
3,Good Product!,"Jimi Hendrix used this pedal. What else needs to be said? There's a reason he used it; it's a good product.The sound is easy to control but there is a learning curve to getting the sound you want. I do experience some unwanted ""hiss"" with it when activated but it's not so bad that it's a huge issue.An adapter is not supplied, nor is a battery, but they're obviously available...but it would be nice to have one or the other included.This pedal is a pain if you want to use it on a pedal-board. While the feet can be removed from the bottom, if you do so, the screws will not screw all the way down into their holes, making it pointless to do remove the feet at all. Unfortunately, the screws can't be left out because they hold the bottom panel on which covers the electronics. This is very annoying.Due to the minor inconveniences, I will rate this with 3 stars."
5,"Good sound, good value, Reliable, original wah wah. Relatively quiet.","I tried a bunch of wah wahs (Morley, Vox, etc.) including the top Dunlop model and they were real noisy and didnt like my pedalboard at all in series. This is the original and the simplest & best one I ever had. Relatively quiet and my pedalboard just loves it. Good value and good product. I wish the off-on stomp switch was easier to activate. I find it difficut to turn it on and off. It isnt any different than the others I've tried, but you really have to step on it hard to click it most times. Maybe theres a way to adjust the switch pressure under the expression pedal. I guess they felt like most people will be turning it on and off while they are using it. Cheers Abz"
3,"Okay product, but untimely shipping!","The Dunlop Crybaby is a good product, but my experience with buying this for my grandson has left me wondering whether I will ever order from Amazon.com again! It was ordeered on April 5th, and supposed to arrive by no later than April 14th. One Nation Electronics did not ship it out from California until April 14th, then UPS turned the whole shipping process into a nightmare. It finally arrived on April 20. I will never use UPS for shipping again!"
1,Not recommended.,"Note: The arguments in this book are rejected by most. Please take that into consideration.It is a shame that this argument is still being made today, given that it was disproven by James Barr in 1961! (cf. ""The Semantics of Biblical Language"")The book by Barr is excellent. If you can get your hands on a copy, do so. It is mildly technical, but one will be able to understand the concepts without a knowledge of biblical languages."
3,Hebrew Thought compared to Greek,"This is a very scholarly book with lots of reference material. I gave up reading it after a few pages. It was just too difficult to get through all the Greek writers, German scholars, plus a lot of references to Egyptian gods and that sort of thing. I'm sure there are some gems in this book, but it will take some effort to find them amid all the scholarly references. The print is small which doesn't help."
4,A pleasant change.,"Loving the music of CUSCO as much as I do, I bought this album immediately upon its release. And it clearly marks a new development in the careers of Micheal Holm and Kristian Schultz, the leaders of CUSCO. Exploring Greek mythology, CUSCO incorporates worldless female vocals in some of their songs, a trait they clearly picked up from both Adiemus and Mythos. But this seems to be a departure from the original basis of the group, which was to promote native American cultures. I would advise CUSCO to not copy others, but also to not abandon what they did in the past to make them great. I still think this is a good CD, but hardly the best that CUSCO can do! For that, you should get Apurimac III Nature Spirit Pride."
3,Very disappointing,"This was the second Cusco CD I got, which was several years ago, and I just listened to it recently, since I've been on a Cusco kick, after getting more of their CDs. Anyway, I was amazed at how awful some of the songs are. I hate those whinny singers who sound like Munchkins with colds. There's a different singer in one of the songs that doesn't sound as bad, but she's really boring. The other CDs I have by Cusco are so much better. The reason I didn't give this CD a 2 was because it actually has one of my favorite Cusco songs on it: Orpheus And Eurydice.I think this CD would've been a lot better, if not for the singers."
4,"""The Odyssey is visit by Cusco""","Higher Octave presents another winner with ""Inner Journeys"" featuring the instrumental moods of Cusco. This groups sound is unmistakable with a style all their own. Blends of ethnic fusion, jazz and pop like you've never heard before. Opening cue ""ORACLE OF DELPHI"", shares Greeks myths and legends with haunting counterpoints beautifully arranged by the Gods ~ ""ODYSSEUS AND THE SIRENS"", one can almost hear Homer reciting ""The Odyssey"" and the fates that await all non-believers ~ ""POSEIDON"", searching the sea with might, as Cusco conveys all within this final track. An international ensemble presents richly textured music ~ woven into ancient Greek history. Old world instruments take the forefront as every fan listens to the embellishments with cravings. All one can think of is wanting more of this genre known as New Age. Nobody does it better than ~ CUSCO!Total Time: 54:02 on 10 Tracks ~ Higher Octave 82259 ~ (3/25/2003)"
2,Where's the Cusco Magic ?,"Being a long time fan of Cusco Music, I eagerly anticipated the newest addition to the Cusco Collecion : Inner Journeys. Where is the Cusco Magic??? I was very disappointed. This CD has potential, but just as I began to enjoy ""Orace of Delphi"", the addition of the irritating vocals distroyed all of my enjoyment. The same situation happened on track "" The Nine Nuses"" If this CD did not try somthing new- high-pitched, screaching vocal sounds, I would have given it a 4 star rating. The other tracks were typical Cusco rhythms, but not magical. Do not bother buying this CD."
3,Not too bad for floor caulking,"First off, I highly recommend NOT using this product for the bathtub, even though it's marketed as being suitable for caulking bathtubs. It won't stay put. Believe me, after a day or two the caulkstrip will come undone. However, this product is better suited for the other thing it's recommended for - floors. I used this product on my foyer floor along the floor trimming or baseboard. I have a second floor condo near the woods, and sometimes bugs get in under the baseboard/floor trim. For the most part, there has been a reduction in the number of critters getting in. The strips come undone frequently, so I have to frequently press them down to make them stick again.Overall, not a bad product for FLOOR caulking. A terrible product for BATHTUB caulking, however."
1,"Too bad the burst pipes didn't take these out, too","As awful as the post-Wetton Asia releases have been, even they are an improvement over these 2 efforts - never-released garbage that even the band forgot about until a pipe burst and flooded their studio."
3,Rev Franklin,"This is not one of Rev. Franklin's best sermons. It is hard to follow the message he is attempting to convey. His absolute best sermon is The Eagle Stirreth Her Nest, which is a classic."
3,Good for creating trip itinerary,"I bought this book when I was still dreaming of a vacation to Hawaii. I used it, primarily, to decide which island(s) I wanted to visit. Once I had chosen the island where I would be staying, I bought a guidebook for that island in particular. I didn't consult this book too much after that.A scenario such as this one is the primary one for which I'd reccommend this book. Becuase it covers all of the Hawaiian islands, it is necessarily broad and a little skimpy on detail. Use this guide to choose which islands are right for you, and then buy specific guides for those individual islands. I wouldn't plan an entire Hawaiian vacation based on this guide alone."
2,Only for travelers with a big budgets,"Geared toward travelers who have a lot to spent on hotels, shopping, and entertainment. Not recommended for most people."
5,Excellent Travel Companion!,"I took a gamble when purchasing this book before my wife and I took a vacation to Hawaii(Oahu,Maui)this summer. Boy, am I glad that I did. The Frommer's Hawaii 2002 went everywhere with us. It enhanced our trip greatly and we would have missed a lot without it. The maps were extremely helpful when navigating around to our desired destinations. We also appreciated the insite on the places to dine, hike, snorkle, kayak, etc. If you are in the market for a travel guide I highly recommend this guide."
3,"Not bad, but...","If you buy this, don't bother buying Frommer's Hawaii From $80 A Day. Most of it is word for word."
1,FRommer's Hawaii 2007 is Wrong,"At every turn when I took this book to hawaii I found mistakes in the text, places out of business or not such address. I wasted a lot of time following advice from this book I will never trust a Frommer Guide again. Look elsewhere."
4,Thorough and essential for those traveling to Hawaii,I found Frommer's Hawaii 2004 to be a good guide. The feature I like the best is that they update it every year. It is very handy and their ratings are always correct and meet my standards. Everything is current and that includes the restaurants prices which sways me one way or another.I noticed that one reviewer said he preferred the blue Ultimate books but they didn't suit me at all. I found them burdened and weighted with the authors opinions and difficult to read in parts. As a seasoned traveler I like knowing the solid facts and letting the unexpected surprise me. Traveling wouldn't be as much fun if there wasn't some mystery or charming local to fill in the blanks.I've used Frommers Hawaii successfully to snorkel and body surf. It provides just enough detail. You will be in good hands with an experienced author such as Jeanette Foster.
5,Great,Great books. Can be life changing if learned and applied properly. I am now a fan of Og's and plan on reading many more or his books.
3,Og Mandinos Great Trilogy,"I was surprised that this was all three books bound into one book. It was not the most professional looking presentation and I would have preferred to have them more like a set of three books as I often give these as gifts. Still having them all bound together guarantees I will always have a copy of at least these. Because the binding is too funky and each book is, I think, its own statement."
1,Very disappointing,"I am a teacher and was very excited to see that there was a new DVD on Chernobyl showing the effects of the accident 20 years later. The DVD is very dry and mentioned that there was a high rate of thyroid cancer among the people in the area, but the casualties were low so it didn't seem to matter how many people were sick. I would have liked to hear more figures and results. It is very pro nuclear power as a green source of energy, but seemed to gloss over some information which made my students wonder how safe and green the energy source really is."
5,Heston brings the Bible to life,"Charlton Heston is to be commended for his fabulous job in ""Jesus of Nazareth"". He brings the story of Jesus' life on earth to life as he shows us the places where Jesus lived and taught, while interweaving the appropriate Biblical narratives. Charlton Heston's dramatic readings give this DVD a truly emotional impact. A+++"
3,Not what I expected,"This film was ok as far as it went, however it was not what I was looking for. This is a sermon by Charlton Heston telling the story of Jesus of Nazareth. That is fine as long as it is what you are looking for. There was movie that came out a few years ago called ""Jesus of Nazareth"" which was a dramatization with actual actors playing the parts. I saw a few scenes of it during a Lenten mission at my church. It was very moving and was looking to see the whole movie."
2,Disappointed,"This was mostly just reading of the scriptures with discussion & a few scenes of Israel. Just not what we expected. Disappointed, especially after seeing some of the kids movies Charlton Heston was involved with, as they were very well done!"
2,the bible,i GOT the charlton heston presents the bible he doesnot give the total bible he gives bit and piece the filming is very good but it needs the full content......
3,Just okay,"I buy a lot of biblical DVD's for a bible study class, but I was not really impressed with this one. It was okay, but I've found many a more interesting. I wouldn't buy another in this series."
2,Fiance loved it...I was disappointed,Received this item quickly and in beautiful wrapping. BUT when my fiance opened it there was not a rubber ducky in the box. Instead in its place was a cheap foam ducky with hard plastic around it where you could tell it was cut from the molding. The product description and picture clearly state and show a rubber ducky. While my fiance was very pleased with the gesture and likes the bubble bath I was extremely disappointed that there was no rubber ducky. I bought this because I thought the rubber ducky set this gift set apart from the others. Young or old. Who wouldn't like to get a rubber ducky? I wouldn't recommend this gift box until they remedy the rubber duck problem.
3,No captions or subtitles?,"It's a fine show, and the price is reasonable for the amount of material... but these DVDs lack both closed captions AND subtitles! In this day and age, I don't think this is an ""optional"" feature for DVD producers of anything but the most cheapjack material. On a high-quality, high-profile, high-price release like this, there's no excuse."
4,Holy Eurythmics Batman!!!,"O.k, so Mulu don't sound exactly like the Eurythmics, but they are indicative of what that group would sound like in this day and age if they were still in their prime. Mulu also features a soulful singer with a hell of a lot of range. Although they've been called tip-hop, and yes, excellent songs like 'Desire' and 'Trixter' do have ""that familiar sound"", to pin them to one genre is far too limiting. Songs like 'Filmstar' and 'Pussycat' are pure, well written pop. The singer, sounding like Annie Lennox using her lower register one minute, and trilling and swooping like Elizabeth Fraser from the Cocteau Twins the next, is what makes this group great. A very self assured first album. Let's hope it won't be the last. Similar Artists: Eurythmics,Sneaker Pimps,Bjork,Moloko."
5,Your Guide to using Kreinik Metal Threads,"This is a fantastic book. It not only has some lovely projects for you to do using metal threads, but it also is jam-packed with information on how to use the threads, and lots of details about the different products available from Kreinik.As the Embroidery Host at BellaOnline, I get a lot of queries about metal thread embroidery, and have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this book as the best to have when starting to stitch metal thread work.This book is definately worth the money, and will inspire you to add the sparkle of metal to your embroidery projects."
4,The book that got me addicted,This book's fascinating. I had never realized how approachable this art form is but this author paved the way for me in gold!
5,What a great tree.,"This tree is huge and well lit. It was a great value after Christmas. I am very please with the quality of the tree and I'm sure it will last me years to come. I am very happy with the quality I received. It was much nicer than I expected, later and fuller."
1,Not a Great Reference Book,This book was no help to me whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend buying it. I got more information from searches I did online.
3,Very Useful,Great book for understanding where to start when it comes to grant writing. I used it for a class and it taught me more than I ever thought existed about non-profits and grass root organizations and where to go for funding. I've lent it to a friend who is trying to get funding from the NEA...we'll see how it does.
5,Greatest book on earth,"Great book, has a lot of info, hope it works out for me. It gives a lot of guide lines."
3,More for organizations than individuals,It more geared towards someone writing for grants for a non-profit as opposed to artist/business grants.
3,Wrong size,"We received the wrong size. However, the product was nicely packaged and looked brand new. I am not sure why the size was incorrect even though I typed the model number etc. correctly. Unfortunately, this had to be returned. Still giving 3 stars for the packaging and quality of the product. Had it been the right size, I would have given it a 5 star."
4,Nice one...,"It is a nice book, contaning many nice tricks, and even illusions. You can start your magic with this book, but if you want to become a serious magicians, this is not enough.AJ"
2,A Beginner's Guide to Organic,"McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to know. Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and synthesis problems, in particular). If you're looking to become a chemist, this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend Vollhardt and Schore's textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e., on exams or out in the industry)."
4,Great,"Really, I thought this was a great text. I feel like the layout really made a difference, though I can't say that had I another book I'd have learned o chem with any less success...but the background chapters really help with the overall grasp of the chemistry, and the review/carbonyl preview sections in the middle do the same so that things become predictable and simpler than with other texts I've seen. I thought all the diagrams were pretty clear along with the actual text, so I don't know what the lower ratings are about."
3,Organic Chemistry,"I found this book to be helpful in my organic chemistry class. It has great diagrams and explains the concepts fairly well so one can understand what is being said. The book does come with a CD, which I did not use for the class. The book also has many examples, practice problems with solutions in the back, and chapter summaries. I recommend this book for anyone who is serious about organic chemistry."
1,Will not help at all!!!,"This book was the required textbook for my organic I and II class...and it didn't help with either. If you didn't understands something the way the professor explained it, the book provided no help. The explainations in it were very short and were of no help at all. Most of the time the examples were too simple to really teach you anything. This is a very elementary textbook, that doesn't seem worthy to me of a place in any college or university."
2,Not enough,"This is the required text for my course. I've read it thoroughly and it seems great, but it definitely is not getting me the grade I want. I'm buying a different textbook to supplement."
4,sensual techno with smooth basslines and subdued melodies,"For those into minimal techno or mellow, non-aggressive techno with a calm pace, this album will please. Most tracks evoke serene moods while a couple approach monotony. Check out the audio samples, they're very representative of the album."
3,Groove La Chord is nothing but 5stars Transmat stuff GREAT,"The name Aril Brikha is new to me.??? Anyway, the material on 'Departure In Time' is outstanding Detroit stuff in tracks like 'Groove LaChord', while others don't attract me that much. However, it's Transmat and a must for us collectors. Although it's a 3, it will peak to 5 now and then. What a mood!"
5,A treasure from the Big Band era,"You get the best of both worlds with this 2-CD set -- the sultry Miss Peggy Lee and the incredible Benny Goodman!! This wonderful collection really captures the emotions of that era. From love ballads to swing, it's all here performed with heart and soul and impeccable style."
3,"Cute, but not practical..","I bought this set to supplement a Cook for the Cure KitchenAid piece that I already had. And sadly, there is no comparison. They are a pretty shade of pink, but are not practical for regular use. The teflon is coming off in large patches in my large sauce pan. The pink enamel hasn't chipped, but it picks up every black scuff and isn't very attractive any longer. The handles are not silicon (as originally thought), but some kind of plastic which is wearing badly from regular use. I paid a fair amount of money for the set, and so plan on using them until they fall apart... but that could be any day now.I wouldn't buy another thing from this company."
2,Cheap - don't waste your money,"These are a very pretty shade of pink but they don't hold up at all to regular use. I used the frying pan about four times and it started to peel. I kept the temperature at medium to low as you're supposed to with non-stick and only cleaned with water and a sponge. I didn't bother keeping the set with the controversy around non-stick and high temperatures. Save your money or buy the much, much better blinQ set - which I did (all stainless). It was a nice idea but poorly executed."
3,Pretty cookware,"The cookware is very pretty and matches other pink in my kitchen, but it just isn't a fine set of cookware. Looks nice though."
1,I was dissapointed,the cook for the cure were very light weightI compared them with sets I have seen for much less . I loved the color
3,Cute,"I think this is a very cute set. It is a perfect gift for your average pink kitchen lover. However, I am not sure how pratical these pans are. I am a collector, so I have no intention of ever using them to cook with. It seems to me like these pans are more for show. I don't think they would stand the test of time, if they were used regularly. The paint seems like it would chip easily. Also, the large lid does not fit the large frying pan. The rest of the pans and lids fit each other fine. All in all I think it is a very beautiful set. This cookware set is rare, not alot of merchants offer this kind of product. They should be used moderatly, if even used at all. If you want a durable everyday-use cookware set go with T-Fal."
2,not that great overall but a few really good songs,"So, honestly, I only like this CD for 3 songs. That kinda sucks considering there are 13 tracks. But tracks 2, 3 and 13 are amazing. I've been trying to find more by the artist who does track 3, ""transit u.k."" 'cause honestly this one track stands out so much compared to the rest of the cd."
3,I am into this album,"Hi guys my name is NeonFunk, the first track is mine, if you want to listen to all my titles, go there: neonfunk-music.com, i hope you will appreciate.....cheers"
2,You get what you pay for!,"This very well may the shortest and cheapest books on parenting the only child, but I found it thin on the type of information that I was looking for. There are no fast fixes to parenting and I was hoping for more depth in dealing with issues that were of great importance to me."
3,The Catcher!,It was a interesting novel but i didn't enjoy it well do i enjoy reading books anyway NOOOOO! I get all my english novels off the internet i don't bother reading books! I have better stuff then to read stupid books!
3,Very good content; but print too small,"I haven't read all of it...it is very large...What I have read has been very good, but the print is so small, it's difficult to read."
4,so far so good,the optical doesnt work but the component cables do long and solid enough i guess for what ya pay but again i can not rate the optical cus it dont work .
4,just what I needed,"Switching from composite video connection to component, and with this set specifically, eliminated the glitchy playback I was getting from a DVD player on an HDTV. The cables seem thick, which suggests quite a high quality for the price ($8 for my order).The plastic case they are packaged in is excessive and utterly unnecessary; I cut 1 star for company being environmentally irresponsible and disrespectful."
4,Very nice cables. Good price and image quality is terrific (progressive scan dvd),"As per the summary - a very nice value in good component cables, especially for this length."
1,THIS MAY BE MISLEADING,"lOOK CAREFULLY BEFORE ORDERING. THIS PRODUCT IS LISTED UNDER THE PRO 4X LABELING, BUT WHEN PLACED IN THE CART IT SHOWS AS THE NON-PRO 4X PRODUCT!"
2,Bland Stories of the West!,"Being unfamiliar with author Earl Murray's work, I purchased this book based on the publisher's blurb and the book's intriguing sub-title. I should have done more checking and saved my money.This books consists of 10 stories set in the old West and more modern times. The stories don't run chronologically which I found somewhat jarring. The problem is the switch from a story about an Indian attack on a wagon train to one on neo-nazi punks planning a Columbine-style bloodbath to one on an old West poker game with a mysterious stranger sitting in, etc.The book's main failing however is the stories themselves. Overall they are pretty bland and uninvolving. The characters are superficial, the action plodding and several stories just kind of trail off without a satisfactory denouement. And I still am trying to fathom why these are ""secret stories of the West!?!""Pass on this one, folks."
3,Lip Gloss ok,"I like the color of the gloss. The presentation was nice, it came in a beautiful plastic bottle. Unfortunately, it has my lips feel very dry. I wouldn't purchase this again."
2,wow... big book. far fetched?,"Not an easy read... pretty ""flighty"" swoops around from subject to subject, really difficult to follow. Wouldn't particularily reccomend."
3,"This book was alright, just not what I was looking for.","The book was a little too new-agey in my opinion. When I purchased it, I thought I was buying a book that would help me chart my cycles, and really know when I could conceive. Instead what I got was a book on earth, air, wind, fire and mythology. I was pretty disappointed."
4,"good,but nothing compared to 'one nation under'","from zero kinda slipped under my radar since their 2001 debut which amazed the heck outta me.i saw this cd perusing thru a cd store one day and i had to buy it; it was really cheap, like 7 dollars.so i popped it in having not heard anything off it yet and 'myself' just blew me away.what an incredible song.then i heard 'lines' and i was amazed again.'sorry' came and that song was horrid.i skipped around,but nothing caught my attention until 'time of day' and 'fleeting glimpse'.other than those 4,the album is nothing but filler; however,these songs plus a low price make this album worth checking out."
4,Great work by relative unknowns,"I am a big fan of aggro rock, especially with synth and sampling, e.g., Linkin Park is one of my favorites. I had never heard of From Zero until last week while on a business trip in Chicago, heard radio station 94.7 giving this local band lots of airplay (track ""Sorry"", which at first I thought was Eminem pretending to be Linkin Park). Went and bought the album immediately and played the entire thing in the CD player of my rental car, enjoy it immensely. For a relatively unknown band, they have a lot of variety and layering. Highly recommend."
4,From Zero: My So-Called Life,"I loved From Zero's debut cd, One Nation Under. It is one cd that always gets me pumped and never plays out. From Zero is so talented the band is heavy and fast at times but they can also be very melodic and calm in the same song! I would say that My So-Called Life is a great CD and I would definately reccomend it to anyone. One Nation Under is a must have and if you like that CD and are a big fan, buy this one because it opens up another side of them. Songs like ""Time of Day"" still hold true to their heavy, fast paced sound while others like ""Sorry"" are a bit different than the sound we are used to hearing, but still very good. This CD is a must have for any From Zero fan."
2,My So-Called Life,"Underneath all the cliches that From Zero seem to stumble into on their albums, there's a sense that the band is really trying their hardest to make their songs shine, and although Jett's lyrics really do need work, there's a certain openness in them that is somewhat refreshing when compared to other bands in the genre. He's also remarkably melodic in his singing, another barrier that the band manages to break. However, albums can't rely on sincerity alone. Although songs like Believe and the band's cover of the Phil Collins track I Don't Care Anymore make you almost want to enjoy the rest of the album, the third generation nu-metal riffs and horribly colloquial lyrical content causes the rest of the album to suffer tremendously. The band has the drive to succeed and their heart is definitely in the right place, but they are missing the most important part of the songwriting process: the talent."
2,My so called life departs from One Nation Under.,"Where did the strong melodies that were so apparent on some of the songs in the first album go? Someone find them again and put them back. It's not funny anymore.What happened to this band? Please come back. PLEASE! Dont try linkin park, eminem or limp bizkit anymore... please. Let that originality shine through that was so apparent in the first album come back again on album 3. No more ""everyone elses music"" okay? These guys have so much potential and they had an original formula in the first album and it beats me why they would depart from it to sound unoriginal. From Zero bring back the real you on your next album. Thanks so much for One Nation Under. I hope ""My So Called Life"" is just a growing experience and not the end all be all. Remember... the basic winning formula is ... strong melodies, harmonies and hard no holds bar rock."
4,From Zero to Millions,"Let me start by sayin From Zero is an incredibly diverse band, with that said everyone one here said ""Jett should rap"" ""he sounds like Eminem"" shouldnt be listening to these guys in the first place! Jett isn't rapping!! The rapping is coming from Jett's best friend. He gave his friend a shot in the song. I mean come on don't you guys read the booklet after you get the cd. My So Called Life isn't better than One Nation Under but its a good cd, overall"
5,Ripjaws is no rip off!,This is one of the other figures you should get. This is an amazing figure and i think this is also a highly recomended toy as well1!
4,Spacious and ambient,"Ignore the ""What the critics say"" stuff above - that's referring to Foxx's other album from 1997, _Shifting City_, which wasn't released in the US. _Cathedral Oceans_ is a very different beast, drifting yet grandiose ""architectural music"", composed from layers of lush synths, natural sounds (birds, etc) and Foxx's own voice heavily layered in a manner reminiscent of Gregorian chant. Closest thing in his past work is the title track of ""The Garden"", although this doesn't have regular vocals. In the right setting, this album is very impressive indeed."
3,Dissapointed Girl,"The game is great and everything, but they didn't include KING HAROLD! Stupid video game."
5,OceanAvenue review.,"Ocean Avenue is a cd anybody who likes punk/alternative rock should own. The first single from the album ""way away"" was a great introduction to the world of Yellowcard. I instantly fell in love with it myself.The cd then follows with ""breathing"" this is a great.. slightly heavier song than the rest of the album, with great lyrics.""ocean avenue"" follows as their next single which iontroduced a slightly softer side to yellowcard.Then follows ""life of a salesman"", another soft song that instantly grows on you.One of my favourites.. ""wiew from heaven"" has the distinct sound of the violin throughout it, also with the backup vocals of a former band member's sister.The rest of the album features up-beat and more slow songs... Ryans beautiful voice not missing a note in even the most difficult of melodies.Great album.Go YC"
1,wannabe emo,"this is one of the worst bands ever. its pretty sad that some people think that these guys r punk. if u think this is punk u are a poser. emos pretty crappy. all emo is is just wannabe metle or punk. and these guys r just wannabe emo. if u wanna listen to some good pop punk(good charolett is not punk, neither is simple plan, NFG, or greenday, or blink 182)listen to the mr T expereanc. or dillinger four, or the decenants. and if u wanna listen to some pure punk listen to beerzone. i hope this review was helpful. this didnt even desurve one star. ps. blink 182 used to be punk back in the early 90's"
1,oh boy,Oh boy does this cd suck. They sound like hoobastank and blink 182 colliding together. The lead singer sucks and the band just plays the same chord in each song. Boring!
1,Why God Made This Band,"To all the non-believers out there, right on and such, but there is on thing I must say: Yellowcard had to made by a divine being. Why? So we can appreciate the good music out there. If we didn't have this intestinal garbage stinking up the airwaves, then how could we pay proper homage to the greats? If Yellowcard didn't exist, who else would have f--ked up 'Don't You (Forget About Me)'? The teenage boys and preppy girls would the have nothing to ""rock out"" to, then they would be forced to pretend they like the good music. If they did that, then all the cool music would be played in ten-second clips on MTV and rotated amongst complete toolerage. So thank you God for making this pile of dung we wished never to knew, Yellowcard."
2,Mixed Review...,"blah...thats all that i can say to describe ""Yellowcard's"" second release. some of the songs are okay, but some really suck too. plus, their albums called ""ocean avenue"", a popular hang out in santa monica, california. WHAT POSERS!!!!!they dont even like cali (note track 13). Guess what guys, Southern Cali dont like you either..."
3,Fine album but...,"One For The Kids was so much better, simply not comparable. It's not a bad album but my expectations were so higher than this CD after One For The Kids and the EP they released (I saw them in show with Lagwagon, Avoid One Thing and Rufio like a year ago. I also know that they have another album (out of print). The songs on this album are not deep enough, its like they threw the music there without thinking any, just to get 13 year old girls attention. Only One For The Kids and the EP are the only CDs I still listen to because they are good enough to get 5 stars. This one is an ok album but these guys wanted to imitate Simple Plan (u know the way a band starts doing music that sucks to get a lot of money)"
4,Suprise!,"The best song- Way AwayI got hooked to that song the first time i heard it. Its really good.Though im not much of a fan for emo, this cd was suprisingly really good. Ive lsitened to it so many times i talk the words in my sleep. I would recomend this to anyone who likes pop-punk, this would make a great addition to your cd cllection."
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"This is the best CD not only by Yellowcard, but probably the best on Amazon.com! All of the songs are simply awesome. Ran sings with such emotion, and Sean plays the violin like there's no tomorrow. LP puts all the music in motion with his superb drumming.This is a perfect CD-- it doesn't get any better than this!"
3,Well.....the first three songs are good,"About a week ago, I saw YC perform live at the Hard Rock Cafe in Orlando. These guys were just full of energy. I downloaded this CD to see if it's any good before I buy it. Let me tell you, I was blown away by the first three songs (way away, breathing, & ocean avenue). But, the rest of this album is just disappointing. Just plain cheesy punk-wanna-be music that sound just like all the other MTV-favored bands outhere (ex. Simple Plan). The result: I bought those three songs on Sonic Stage, just to pay them the amount that they deserve ($3). If you like stuff like Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, etc. buy this CD. If you're not sure, at least check out the first three songs (well, two if you're fed up with Ocean Avenue)."
2,Don't Let the Single Fool You,"When I first heard the song ""Ocean Avenue"" I was blown away by it and borrowed it from my friend to burn it. However, when I actually listend to the whole album, it was not at all what it seems to be by just listening to that one single. The lyrics die down and so does the music. It starts out with 2 really good songs just to keep you listening I guess, and then it just gets bad. I didn't even want to listen to the whole CD it was that bad. I would not at all recomend buying this album, if you liked ""Ocean Avenue"" just burn that song and forget the rest of it. The only good thing about yellowcard is their unioqness, because they don't sound like anyone else."
5,Ocean Ave,Yellowcard is one of my FAVORITE bands and Ocean Ave is their best album yet!! I couldnt stop listening to it when it first came out. All of the songs on the cd have a meaning and you can tell that the guys try their hardest with their music. Every song can put you in a different mood. Its almost as though you can see right through their eyes with their music. I love this cd! And I totally recommend that you buy it!!
5,Yellowcard rox!,"The new entitled album ""Ocean Avenue"" by Yellowcard is unique and much different from other pop-punk bands. These guys have awesome lyrics along with catchy tones and inspiring ballads. Unlike most punk bands that consist of a guitar, bass and drums, Yellowcard has a violin that makes many of the songs on their new album different let better. I suggest if you like good music you should go out and buy this album. It rocks! Believe me you won't be disapointed. Like their track 11 states, ""Everything is ganna be alright"", if you buy this alubm everything is ganna be alright!"
5,Brilliant,"One of the best punk/poppunk CD's I have ever heard. This band definetly deserves more recognition. I personally think that Yellowcards debut album, ""One for the Kids"" (which is a very good CD) pales in comparison to their latest work, ""Ocean Avenue"". They have mastered how to encorporate a violin into a punk band. Some songs that are personal favorites of mine are ""Life of a Salesman"", and ""Ocean Avenue"". I am willing to go far enough to say that if you're even remotely interested in punk rock, pick this album up. I read that the song ""Way Away"" is going to be on the new Madden NFL 2004 videogame, good for them. They defintely deserve the exposure."
3,"Okay, I suppose...","I don't know, this CD just didn't really do it for me. The chord progressions for many of the songs aren't that great. That's not the case for ""Way Away"", ""Ocean Avenue"", ""Only One"", ""One Year, Six Months"" and a few other very listenable songs on this album. But it's not really worth it to buy the whole album, in my opinion. I guess I could see this being more appealing to some other people, you know, the scream-my-heart-out kind, who don't really need music, they just need a way to vent their anger. Of course, as the afore mentioned songs will prove, there IS some real music on this album. Just not as much as I think Yellowcard is capable of."
5,this is how it is,You most likely have heard of them because of:Ocean AvenueInteresting point: violin playerBest song played loud:Breathing/ocean ave/23Best slow song:Empty ApartmentBest Lyrics:Life of a salesmanMy favourite:Empty ApartmentAlso good by this band: Gifts and Curses (spiderman soundtrack)Everywhere (michelle branch cover)If you like this look out for:ummmmm good charlotte maybe
5,Fun!,"And I like Simple Plan (and tons of other pop-punk bands - but not GC), and that ""emo crap"".But I also like Rancid, Metallica, Rammstein, and Nofx.So stop saying that this is crap and metal pwns and if we listen to metal, we'll stop listening to this and start bashing it instead, both are good in their own way.Anyways, this album is great. The songs are catchy and fun, and it's great to pop in during parties. The violin adds depth to their songs, and since I play violin, it has a special impact on myself."
5,Simply Perfect,"This CD is by far the best CD i have ever purchased. Everything single song on the album is excellent. I have liked Yellowcard since the beginning with Underdog EP and One For the Kids (also excellent cds) and i continue to be impressed. They have a unique style of music that almost everyone likes. Every person that i know likes this band, no matter what style of music they normally listen to. If you are to buy any cd, make it Ocean Avenue"
5,yellowcard hot hot hot album!!!,if you are a fan of bands like story of the year and other new punk bands this is def the cd for you. yellowcard bring a unique sound with their violin skills and this album def shows how they have matured musically so go out and buy it NOW it is a must have for every collection!!!
5,Why Ocean Aveune is where you should be!,"This is an awsome CD!!! there's not one song on this CD(in my opinion) that you wouldnt want to listen too!! My personal Favs are Ocean Aveune ( the title track) Empty Apartment( this one's my favorite without a doubt!) & One and Only ( it song is SO awsome I can't even tell you!!) THis band is truely awsome!! the combination of Ryan's vocals and the gutiars, bass, drums adn violin... yes the violin!! makes this cd - band totally awsome and unique!!! if you don't have this CD your missing out!!!"
5,"Simply Amazing, My Favorite Band","Words don't describe how great this band is. I caught myself smiling often times throughout the cd just enjoying their talent. The songs are all upbeat for the most part and really put you in a good mood. Its almost impossibe to listen and not want to jump up and down with excitement. The violin is a great addition and really makes the band stick out. They would be a great band without it, but with it they are above the top. I highly recommend you all pick up this great cd."
4,Yellowcard brilliance,"Searching for something fun, upbeat, and a bit unconventional? Yellowcard is one those bands who definitely capture the spirit. Their first major label release from Capital records definitely churns out catchy lyrics amid the complements of Sean Mackin's violin playing. It is hard not to miss the brilliance of Mackin's abilities complementing the guitar licks on the album especially on the song ""Believe."" The title track, ""Ocean Avenue"" definitely will be Yellowcard's summer hit. Most albums have one good song but it's amazing that a majority of the songs written by Yellowcard are actually memorable. The lyrics may not be deep but Yellowcard is one of those bands who epitomize what days of summer are about: upbeat and fun to listen to"
5,Catchiest Cd in a long time,"Every song contained within this alblum is fantastic, each song has it's own part that makes it unique. The violin playing has been brought up a little in this cd. You can tell he gets a little more technical and is compliments the songs very nicely. I haven't been able to stop listening to this cd for 3 straight days, do yourself a favor and purchase this quickly"
3,Disapointed,"I bought this Cd a while back and enjoyed every song. In fact My GF and I share Only One as one of ""our songs"".But to tell you the truth, I was extremely disapointed when I paid to see them at warped tour to hear them slinging political lingo in between every song. Last time I checked they were a band, not politicians. They rank up there with Green Day as being stupid enough to think they actually had some sort of political sway. Come on YC, lets get it straight, your major fanbase are kids under 18. No political sway there. And anyone old enough to vote who actually listens I'm sure is old enough to make their own decisions. Keep up what you do best, music. No one cares ""who yellowcard is voting for"".The CD was a good purchase, but its funny how the band's personality totally ruins their music."
4,3 stars,"I admit the idea of a violin in pop/punk was what drew me to this CD. Is it amazing and revolutionary? No, it's really not. Was it a great idea? I believe so, it still offers a unique sound although sometimes the violin does get a little buried in the overpowering sound of the drums and crunching guitars. The slow songs where the violinist especially shines through, and is just a nice and interesting addition to the fast more energetic songs. If you want to hear what I think is the best song for the violin in the CD, listen to View From Heaven (my second favorite song), it sounds pop/rock/country-ish and it's definitely not something I was expecting from this band. I don't really like the vocals, but I'm sure it'll settle in after a few more days. I was a bit afraid I wouldn't like the CD at all because I don't really like the song Ocean Avenue, but I'm impressed. Good job, Yellowcard. *thumbs up*"
5,"Original, Unique, Incredible Album","When I first heard about yellowcard and my friend told me they had a violin, I was like, ""oh, a violin. What a stupid idea."" Well, I decided to download one of their songs on a whim, and wow was I surprised. The violin just gives the band an awesome song and makes them unlike anyone else. Their lyrics are incredible, they aren't just another generic punk band who write about stupid things, they have deep lyrics and some songs bring you clost to tears. Anyway, ""Empty Apartment"", ""Only One"", and ""Life of A Salesman"" are the best songs, although its really hard to choose cause their all so good. The other two albums are just as good, especially Underdog. Anyone who rags on the violin obviously just isn't into seeing a band do something unique and different. Yellowcard rocks!"
2,"Dum,Dum,DUM.......Oh, I'm reviewing??","Ok, I love the songs empty apartment and one year, six months off this cd and they are the only songs on here that will truly effect anyone to think whatsoever...the rest of this cd doesn't have meaningful lyrics. This cd is somewhat annoying and kinda makes you want to scream at some point becasue the songs get old and start to sound the same. C'mon people, don't listen to what MTV tells you listen to and find your own sound. I have listened to YC for a few years now and am sad to see them on MTV, that sucks. This cd is disappointing if you want a new sound or different lyrics in each song. Buy the Underdog EP, the song Finish Line I really love and recommend to everyone, great lyrics and great sound. Well, sorry YC, hope your next cd is a tad better. DON'T SUPPORT MTV!!! Support FUSE!!! enjoi."
5,An extremely catchy album.,"Being from the UK, I hadn't really heard of Yellowcard at all, until however I randomly stumbled across a cover of ""Everywhere"" by them and was instantly addicted. I went out and bought this CD and to start off with, I wasn't that impressed to be honest - however, after a few weeks of casual listening to it, I found myself singing along to the songs and randomly getting choruses stuck in my head. Now well, it's definately in my top 5 cd's ever. I can never seem to turn it off. Can't wait to see them live at leeds festival in summer - I never really like a band unless I'm impressed with them as much so live as in the studio. But yeah, this easily deserves a 5 out of 5, and if you're into any pop-punk whatsoever, or any punk for that matter - as I'm not really into pop-punk that much, you'll love this."
5,One of the Best,"As a fan of punk rock music, Yellowcard is one of my fave bands. Their songs are beautifully written and performed well on the CD and in concert. The very first song brings you in to what Yellowcard is about and in the music scene where you expect to hear the same thing repeatedly; here comes the violin, which is something unexpected. The songs on the CD deal with real life issues like leaving something you love behind (""Way Away"") and praises to those who give up their lives for strangers who needs help (""Believe""). The songs on Ocean Avenue are positive and upbeat and is a must own CD for those who want the ""lighter"" side on punk rock music but the same adrenaline rush as every other punk rock CD."
5,Ocean Avenue is the best cd i have ever owned,"Every song on this cd is awesome. I didn't like the band before i got the cd, but they're my favorite band now.To the person we says yellowcard is a christian group: just because they have lyrics about a close friend who died does not make their music religious."
3,Before the end,"Yellowcard are stronger songsmiths than I would admit in public. Ocean Avenue showed a certain degree of storytelling that other emo-groups seem to miss. Emotion came out of the story, not out of the shameless posturing and power chords. Now their new single shows that the pixies still rule. I mean the soft-verse/loud chorus here is used to thrilling effect, even if the nasal voice and asinine lyrics fail to live up. But I'll be damned if I didn't believe he felt she was his ""Only One."" I mean, its kind of indicative really, a guy can't show his feelings so he just writes a huge song, so maybe she'll get the point. I like them."
5,this cd rocks!,"ok, ""Ocean Avenue"" is truely the best cd i know of. Not many bands have great lyrics and music, but Yellowcard definitely has them both. When i first heard Yellowcard, i couldnt believe there was a rock band w/ a violin, but they wouldnt be yellowcard without it. There are songs for every emotion on this album. Theres upbeat songs that gives off more of a punk rock feeling and then theres others that feature Sean and his violin that give it a classical feeling. Way Away is a great song that just makes you wanna rock out. Only One which features the voilin is a great song w/ awesome lyrics and a great melody. Empty Apartment, a slower song, makes you think about life and friendships. That's only a few of the songs though. I recommend buying the album and checkin the rest out for yourselves."
5,Totally Awesome,"This CD is completley awesome. Ocean Avenue is Yellowcard's first CD on a major record label, and they have done well. It has many songs, good lyrics, and catchy tunes. The violin does add a punch and gives this group a distinctive melody from all the other bands in this category. All in all, it is tatally and completely awesome..."
2,DOWN HILL,"WHAT HAPPENED???? i tell u what happened. instead of yellowcard writing songs from the heart like on one for the kid, they just wanted to become famous and wrote this album that is nothing like their others. This the album that every band hits that make them do DOWN HILL.Lets see the bands that have already succeded this-blink 182(duderanch was sweet)-rufio-new found glory-good charolotte. I DO NOT recommend this album to former ""One for the Kids"" lovers. However i do recommened it to the little bad*** girls that want to where their little bad*** yellowcard shirts to school and have never heard one for the kids and have never touch and intrument in their life.Thats right i play the drums and im said to say ""WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINALITY""?"
1,yellowcard suks,yellowcard suks and i think they are ine of the worst bands except maybe good charlotte
1,Oh no... is this what punk is becoming,"There is only one thing I can ask of anyone who would dream of buying this CD, please at the very least try a real punk band like The ramones, Rancid, The dead kennedy's, or The clash. If you try any of those bands and still like this garbage than my words will do you no good. You might realize that punk actually has a meaning not just whiny men with high pitched voices whining about stupid stuff. All in all this is not punk if you had heard otherwise you were informed incorrectly buy another CD immedeatly."
1,sellouts!!!!,"Yellowcard used to be my favorite band, now they are terrible. They are sellouts, they think they are so good now that there one song is on the radio. Big deal. They are going to be one hit wonders. I suggest you check some real bands like Blink 182, The Starting Line, and Story of the Year"
4,its pretty good,"the cd is okay, but I am really here to reply to a review posted earlier. In this review 'a music fan' compared Jimmy Eat World to stereotypical pop-punk bands like New Found Glory and the Starting Line. I was outraged when I read this. Jimmy Eat World is possibly the best band I can ever remember. Don't judge them by the stuff they play on the radio now. Get some of their older stuff and you'll realize what a great band they are."
1,"This album was great! Actually, it wasn't.","Let's just say I won't be cruising down Ocean Avenue again any time soon. I was highly unimpressed with many factors on this album, one being the usage of the phrase ""Californ-I-A"", which sounds alright when rapped but sounds atrocious in a soft-natured rock song. Many tracks on Ocean Avenue are backed with violin, some being ballads and some being plain old electric guitar-accompanied rock tunes. The most outstanding of the featured songs in my sight is the title track ""Ocean Avenue"", which has the previously mentioned violin factor, hard guitars, and an enjoyable cruising pattern to begin with. Aside from this track and a few select others, most melodies were uninteresting and either too similar to Simple Plan or too similar to crap. I would not recommend this C.D., but would suggest checking out Simple Plan for this style of music.I recommend:Walk AwayBreathingOcean Avenue"
1,Boring and typical,"my friend owns this album and I have to say this is terrible, so what if there is a violinist in the band it doesnt change the bands sound dramatically to the point where they are original they sound like every other crappy, whiny pop punk band and there lyrical matter is the same too, its all about how their girlfriends broke up with them and stupid stuff like that and everything about relationships come on there are more things to write about, basically this album is annoying and boring."
1,we want real punk,yellowcard is just 1 crappy band who tries to be like nofx and the ramones and just end up singing about their gfs and crap but if u wanna listen 2 real music listen 2 bands thta dont cry about their gfs
5,YC - Ocean Ave.,"I guess even though i could sum this cd up in two words (the best) ill tell you that with 13 tracks you hear 13 great songs and get tons of listening time.It never gets played out so you can listen to them over and over again like Enema of The State from Blink. But this album is by far the best yet and you can just listen to it the way through without having to skip songs you dont like. Thats why you need to buy this cd first chance you get. Awesome lyrics, great guitar and bass, incredible drums, and the best punk violin in history of course. Im telling you go buy it today you wont regret it. and pick up the underdog ep and one for the kids while your there5 Stars"
4,yc is better than expected,"so when i first bought this cd, i was thinking that it would suck just like most other pop punk stuff out there right now. but i was completely wrong. this cd is awesome and i recommend it for pretty much everybody. my favorite song is breathing..go buy this cd if you dont have it..its awesome!"
4,different,"im somewhat dissapointed by this cd. I bought it because i liked the sorta different sound of the title track, but after listening to 13 songs of the same type of thing im not sure. There are a couple songs that are good, but no GREAT ones. However, the violin is very strange and errie. That i dont like at all. Actually when i think of it, the ones with the most violin r the worse.Im not sure weather to recomend this or not. If you have the money, but if not spend it on somethin else."
3,yellowcard = Good,"Let me just say two words, OCEAN AVENUE, awsome awsome song, i liked it a lot more before it became popular but none the less that song is a killer. The first song Way Away is also good, the cd is a little to kiddish to my taste, as in the music ratio of punk-ness is to much for me if you get my drift. Its a good cd, havnt listen to it much but good none the less."
5,The New Wave,"Impressed is an understatement. An already avid fan of Yellowcard, this album blew me away. The idea of a violin/fiddle player in a punk band is such an awesome one, and this album finally gives Sean a chance to shine. He adds a great feeling to the whole album.This album overall is awesome. It has a nearly perfect mix of mellow songs and a few old style rock out songs. If you have heard their single 'Way Away' and think its even OK you will love this entire CD.The album shows a lot of maturity in the band both in lyrics and balance. Definitely a must buy. Not only because this CD rocks, but also because small bands need our support. These guys are definitely up and coming, so make sure you get this breakthrough album."
3,somewhat disappointing,"Most of the sonts on this are very catchy and poppy, but they don't really stand out as much. Of course, the violin is great, but overall I'm kind of disappointed with this album. I'm also disappointed that the Ocean Avenue is getting frequent airplay on MTV now."
5,YELLOWCARD-OCEAN AVENUE,"ocean avenue is a great cd as well as a stupendus song.i am a huge yellowcard fan and I could put them against any band in the universe.It is a great buy and you will definetly be happy with, i would be!"
5,Absolutely great CD!,"Each song I can say relates to teenage life. Only one is definitely a break-up song and it hits you right in the heart with how it is. Way away is a very determination filled song. I can't say enough about this album. For those that like to download their cd's, I say DONT! Support these awesome guys and buy the CD!"
5,AN AWSOME BAND,Yellowcard is a great band but what really makes them differnt is that they have a violenist.Shure it might sound lame at first but it gives the band a great sound. I would go through and rate all the songs but they're All great. If you Like any music you will love this Band.
4,sadly I just heard about these guys,This is not an album for those looking for something compleatly original or groundbreaking.THe thing about this album that makes it stand out amungst all the other emo/punk stuff thats floating around these days is the addition of a violnist. Other tan that this is some really good accesabel music that pretty much any fan of blink and jimmy eat world can get into. My only complaint is there are points in the album that get a littel too poppy. Other then that pretty good album. I'll give it 3.5r stars.
2,It was ALRIGHT,"Eh, Pretty standard pop-punk with a violinist thrown into the mix. You won't be blown away be incredible song layouts, vocals, or musicianship, honestly.You won't find anything truely meaningful in the lyrics either, unless maybe you're in highschool. If not, the more you listen to it (20+ times), the less the band really stands out."
5,In my top 3 bands,YC is one of the best bands I have grown to love this year. Right now Ocean Avenue is exploding and this album is really worth a buy. I'm sure you've heard a lot about the uniqueness they hold in being a rock band with a violin player but that's not the only reason I bought this cd. YC is diverse in looks and they don't claim to be something they're not. Yeah--they are punk with pop credentials and they know how to play their music without fear. I am so glad that that faith led me down the path of rockin' Yellowcard goodness. Some songs to check out are Only One--Believe--Way Away--and the last song on the album. But those are just the tip of the Cali snowcone...I suggest the Ataris and Hooba if you're interested in some more great music. Run out and buy this cd...despite your radio doubts.
5,great album,one of my favorite rock albums(even though i like rap)right up there with simple plan.all songs are my favoritebuy this
5,This is the best album from Yellowcard...YET,"All of Yellowcards previous albums -One For The Kids, Underdog EP..etc- were all leading up to this awsome album with a mix of airy fun to listen to punk songs like &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; to heavier songs like &quot;Believe&quot;. All songs have a sweet and sour hit of the viloin by violinist Sean Mackin. If you are a fan of the punk rock scene you must buy this album its on a level all its own... Join YC Underdogs!!"
1,0 stars,"i'm gonna say it, these guys suck a lot, look they have the talent, but first they gotta lose the violinist because that is the dumbest gimmick i have ever seen, and they also have to start playing different music, not manufactured pop punk, please do not suport them"
3,Good band who let insecurity produce their album,"My first experince with this band was in a music fest they played at two days ago, in which they were great. the electric violin was cranked up, and they improvised while playing. Only band all day to yell at the radio station, instead of thanking them. Anyway, I pop in the disk, and It's hard to belive it's the same band, I could hardly pick out the songs I heard from the concert. The sound went from a backyard party to a canned studio mix. The violin is almost gone, dropped into obscurity, the guitar is generic pop punk, and the vocals more whiney/angsty. In conclusion, find when their playing live and save the CD money for a ticket to the show if you dig the whole teen ""punk"" rock thing. They signed stuff too, so get a sticker while your at it."
3,Eh...,"Yellowcard is worth a listen.... A listen. They aren't bad, but even with the violin, it's nothing I haven't heard. If you wanna hear a band that uses a violin, and isn't like The Starting Line with a quirk, check out ZOX."
5,YELLOWCARD IS AMAZING,"This CD is amazing any of you that are thinking of buying this , GO FOR IT!! I was lost for words when i heard this cd, my favorite song is Ocean Avenue. If you want to get a taste of their music go to ..., if you have free time sign up to their e-team also. This CD is worth the cost. It is one of the best i own, and i own alot of CD's.ENJOY"
5,Yellowcard Rocks,"i love this band. its my new favorite. each song makes u wake up and want more YELLOWCARD! normally i dont go for the pop/punk style of music, but this band had completely changed all of that. if u enjoy listening to story of the year, new found glory, switchfoot, linkin park, or simple plan, this is your album!"
3,Just another Punk band..,"I first heard of them cause my friends've been saying how great they are. I gotta say, they're no different than other Childish-Punk-band. Some of the lyrics like ""Only One"" is good, but i guess i just don't really like em. I recommend Taking Back Sunday or Finch. By the way, i think the violin sound is really cool, and that's the reason i give it a 3 stars instead of 2."
5,This cd Rocks!,WoW! Thats one of the first things that popped into my head when i listened to this cd all the way through. I really think that variety of people would like this cd. Its got a little bit of everything. Its got some fast upbeat songs and some slowers paced songs and the lyrics are amazing! I would definitly buy this cd becasue i gaurentee that you will like most of the songs on the cd. I like all of them but thats just my Yellowcard obsession kicking in. If you get a chance go to some lyrics website and check out the lyrics. They are deep. Two thumbs uP!
4,OA Review,"First off let me start by saying Ocean Avenue is no One For The Kids or Underdog..the sound is completely different. The CD more or less tells a story about the bands decision to move from Jacksonville, Florida to California, starting with the song ""Way Away"". Songs such as ""Breathing"", ""Inside Out"", and ""Life of a Salesman"" are more catchy and upbeat, while ""Empty Apartment"", ""One Year, Six Months"", and ""Back Home"" are more slower and melodic. The song ""Believe"" which was written in remberence of 9/11 is one of the most, intense songs on the CD. The beginning of ""View From Heaven"" shows some of Sean's incredible violin skills, while that song was written for a friend of theirs who died in a car accident a while back. The two songs that are my favorite on the CD are ""Only One"" which shows Ryan's incredible singing skills, and ""Empty Apartment"". It's definitely a CD you'll enjoy if your a newer Yellowcard fan, or even if your an older one."
5,"In the car, on a train...",I've been a YC listener for quite some time and I have to say this is one of the best yet. They just seem to get better with every CD! If you want some good music to cruise around and sing along with your friends to: this is it.YC rocks!
5,only one,the new yellowcard is awesome. ive been a yellowcard fan for a long time and this surpasses my expectations! i seriously recommend you buy this cd!!
1,Another group of pussies,"These guys think the music they play is punk. It is the opposite of punk.This is basically pop with guitars and drums. All they sing about is breaking up with their girlfriends and crap like that. Also how can you be punk when u have violin in all of your songs. If you want some real punk listen to the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Clash, Dropkick Murphys, and Green Day. Or if u would rather be a pussy and listen to stuff about ure girlfriends and how bad ure life is when your life is perfectly fine then listen to Yellowcard, Simple PLan,Good Charlotte, Blink-182, and New Found Glory"
2,Punk Rock?,"Well this mix of punk/rock/pop/ sounds familiar. I would group yellowcard with Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, and new found glory in a category of whining punk music.Sure, you'll probably like this CD at first. The band while not talented, has catchy tunes. You'll like to sing along for awhile. Then you will realize this innocent album is nothing special and not a CD you need to buy.I can say I like Only One for its lyrics, and life of a salesman since it tributes the singer's dad.2.5/5 stars"
3,"Unique, but not as good as you think they are.","Yes, they write good ballads like ""Only One"". Yes, they have a violinist that makes them unique.I just don't like the vocals. It's a little too high-pitched.Way Away is a good song... but I think Ocean Avenue, as a song, is poppy.Meh, it's okay if you want to spend your money to buy this, but you can get better albums, I swear."
4,Sroke that violin baby,I havent taken the damn cd out of my player since i got it on the day it came out. yellowcard rocks my world anyway. but this cd even exemplifies their diversity as musicians. keep pushin the limits guys. the violin does it for me all the way. you guys kicked some hard core ... at warped tour in orlando. thanks for giving me a new favorite cd and band to love. all my love boys.
5,A new favorite,"This CD made Yellowcard one of my favorite artists. With big hit songs like Ocean Avenue, Way Away, and Only One, there is no reason to not like this CD. It's got these that everybody will recognize as well as songs like Life of a Salesman. Any song that good deserves to be bought.If you like Jimmy Eat World, All-American Rejects, or basically Alternative rock, this CD is necessary for your collection to be credulously worthy."
5,oh yeah dude! :),"this CD ROCKS! i just really like it! i really don't know what else there is to say about it, but that it just has amazing songs on it. and the songs are all from the heart. :)"
4,highly impressive,"The majority of CDs that have been released in the pop/punk/rock nature have, generally, the same sound. Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue manages to stand out. Violins are not something you hear every day in the music you pop in to jump around to. When I first listened to this CD, I more or less gave a nod of aproval and knew I had stumbled onto something quite impressive. The more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. There's a wide range of sound, from the pulsating rock of 'Breathing' to the soft, melodic twine of One Year, Six Months. Some may say the songs are cliché, but when it gets down to it, the lyrics will strike you and you will find some way or another to relate."
5,best ive heard all year,by far ocean avenue is the best album ive heard all year i think its yellowcards best work i cant help myself listening and singing to it ever since i bought it the vocals are awesome the music rocks and seans violin playing is frikin crazy everyone who likes good music should by this album
5,You have to buy this CD,Ocean Avenue has got to be Yellowcard's best album EVER!!! All the songs on it are awesome and I highly recomend you buy it!!!
5,Woowweee,"Not bad not bad at all....all the songs on this album were really good...my favs are..ocean avenue, way away, breathing, and more..i recomend u get this cd NOW!!"
2,I don't get it...,"I've seen Yellowcard with Something Corporate live and their performance was just a let down compared to Something Corporate but so many people were into it... I don't get it. I guess people like those sell-out sounding pop-""punk"" bands."
3,Their alright...,"They are catchy and energetic, but their also a little boring. The people that listen to this are the same people that listen to stuff like Story Of The Year, Brand New and the new Blink-182 CD (which sucks horribly BTW). Their lyrics are typical, ""I'm gonna run away with my girlfriend"" type stuff. And whats the big deal about having a violin player? Wow they throw in another instrument, big whoop. Their drummer rules though..."
4,Great,"I like Yellowcard. Now their not exactly my favorite band, but their definetly in my top 5. Their basically a pop-punk band with touches of emo here and there, think along the lines of New Found Glory but a little heavier and they have a violin player. Their very musically talented, everything on here sounds tight, especially their drummer (watch out Travis Barker). I'm sure their probably great live too, I'm seeing them on the Warped Tour this summer. The only things they are lacking in is lyrics, while they may be well written, they need to expand into other topics. The only topic they touch on besides girls/relationships is their fathers, thats it. If they can get over that little hump, they'll be an excellent band. If you like Yellowcard, try: New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Blink-182, and Simple Plan."
4,"Decent CD, needs more tracks like Way Away though...","To open on a more negative note, I am tired of hearing people say ""This is a good band, and adding the classical twist of a violin makes it awesome"", etc. etc. etc. Just because a band uses a violin, or clarinet, or trombone or whatever doesn't mean that there's a classical twist added to the song. Sure, there might be an added element that you might not find in Blink-182 or other pop rock acts that you find out there, but it doesn't make all the difference. I don't know why, but Key (cool last name!) has a good voice, not whiny, but not too low. The guitars and bass support him, and the violin adds a nice twist. But there aren't as many tracks as Way Away or Ocean Avenue, definitely the best songs on the CD. Next time guys, make a sound more like Way Away, and it'll probably be a better CD."
2,What happened?,"What happened to Yellowcard? Yes, the cd was okay, but nothing more. They now sound like your average, run-of-the-mill pop punk band. The non-California-residing Yellowcard sounded better, small time band or not. Big disappointment. Hopefully things will get better for them and they'll have more interesting lyrics and sounds next time around. And I'm tired of the whole ""Wow, they've got a violin!"""
5,Amazing cd,"i think that the yellowcard cd is a great cd. It has unique music, because they have a violinest in there band, and it just sounds amazing. all of the tracks are very good, and everyone should buy their cd. There new single i think is a hit, and should be played more on the radio, so more people can hear about them."
2,I'm just not feelin' it.,"I remember all of my friends talking about how great Yellowcard is, so I decided to pick this cd up. I listened to it right when i bought it, and once the cd ended, I thought it was still on the first song. Every song sounds similar! I gave it about 4 more listens thinking I would like it. Turns out I didn't. To me they sound just like any other band these days, even with the violin. The lyrics are alright I guess. The only song that I can stand is ""Believe"", just because of what the song's about (9/11). Basically, if you like generic sounding bands with the generic high pitched voices, but with a violin, pick this up."
2,Do yourself a favor,"...and go listen to some Death Cab for Cutie or Postal Service instead, because if you like this sort of emo-pop thing you might as well get it done right. They're usually pretty wussy too, as emo-pop is bound to be, but their songwriting is about 25 times more sophisticated than Yellowcard and they hit upon the occasional great song.So go get ""Soul Meets Body"" or ""The Sounds of Settling"" or something and bask in the emo-pop goodness. Why settle for the bland stuff?"
2,Adolescent Punk Lite,"A great CD if you're into whiny, adolescent wannabe punk ala Blink 182 and Good Charlotte. Not recommended for anybody over 15 years old."
5,Can't get enough of this lot,"I haven't been able to stop listening to this CD since I bought it. Rarely do you find an album where you can seriously like all 13 tracks and even more, have a hard time figuring out which you like most. As you listen to the CD more you start to enjoy each song more and more.There is something for everyone. They have their slower song and their edgier songs. Something that everyone can relate to. From ""Way Away"" and wanting to get away from everything around you, to ""Back Home"" which reminds you of the very thing you were trying to get away from. It comes full circle. Anyone who enjoys most music, will find this CD hard to put down. The band itself is one of a kind as you can find when you listen to this album, and also previous ones."
5,A great Album,"Yellowcard did a great job with Ocean Avenue, the album starts with Ocean Avenue, and ends with Back Home, both songs have entirely opposite meanings. So they've covered a lot of ground. twenty three is also a good song, with Sean doing lead vocals it has a bit of a different sound which makes the album unique. It allready has 2 hit singles, Way Away and Ocean Avenue, and Only One is the next to be released, and sure to be another huge hit. I loved this album, every song is worth knowing every word and it will make you hungry for more."
5,Yellowcard - Ocean Avenue,This one of the few cds i can listen to all the way through.GREAT CD. BUY IT NOW. WELL WORTH IT.
3,"Very Interesting Band, (Not So) Interesting Album","Yellowcard have a unique sound because of the violinist that is in the band. This gives a typical pop-punk sound some classical underpinnings. This, however, does not make an automatically ""unique"" album.While the first half of ""Ocean Avenue"" is fantastic, shining on tracks such as ""Ocean Avenue"" and ""Only One"", the rest of the album, minus ""Back Home"" falters. ""Twenty Three"" is a typical, pop-punk song, ""View From Heaven"" is sweet, but not exciting, and ""Miles Apart"" is just boring.Yellowcard has a lot of talent, and as seen by the first half of the album plus the last song, can write amazing material (give older songs such as ""Rocket"" a listen as well). Next time, they should me more consistant."
3,I must say...,"That their older stuff is much better. This isn't bad, but I think they're just using the violin as more of a buy-in now. I don't hear as much violin, and it seems they don't incoporate (sp?) it in the music as much. However, they are still decent. They've just got such a user friendly sound now, I'm not just not quite sure about them anymore. The song that really made me start liking them (From ""One for the kids"") is Trembling. Download this song or something if you want a really driving, pounding song. If Yellowcard produced more songs like this, I would be their #1 fan. However, it was a bit of a disappointment they were on Madden 2004 I guess. I guess Thrice was too, but I forgot to diagnose that into the review. Get this cd cautiously, because it seems most other people like it. I guess my music liking is just too complicated for my own good."
5,Awesome Find,"This is honestly one of the best cds I have heard in a while. I had never heard of Yellowcard before my friends birthday when she recieved this as a gift. After listening to this at her house I rushed out to buy it. Being a violin player myself this has really inspired me. The violin is exceptional and the lyrics are outstanding. Lovers of punk rock/pop will enjoy this one. It has something for everyone. My personal favorites are Ocean Avenue, Twentythree, and Breathing (because of the awesome violin playing). If you like Simple Plan, All American Rejects or other sounds like those you will throughouly enjoy this cd."
5,No better book on the name of God.,Anyone with a child should buy this book. Anyone without a child should also buy this book!I've used this book in a number of situations and first came across it at a retreat for those young Franciscans Friars in Religious Formation. It launched a wonderful discussion on our images of God. It is masterfully written and beautifully illustrated.The way in which Sasso presents the variety of our images of God and how they all are equally useful and beautiful illustrates how we can move beyond our differences and become a sign of unity.A great book to have in the house.
5,In God's Name,This book is a delight for young and old alike! It is a wonderful visual treat using multicultural pictures and the message cannot be doubted! God loves all and it makes no difference what name is used for GOD!
3,Okay for the price.,"This little reverb pedal is okay for the price, but the reverb is pretty synthetic-sounding and limited. I purhased a Behringer pedal of equal price and it works much better, more variety and better overall sound."
3,It does the job,It's a pretty basic pedal and doesn't have a lot of features but it will get you some decent reverb.
1,A poor import version of the Rhino VHS - TV show,"Be sure and read the customer reviews on Amazon's other listing for this DVD. I don't know why Amazon has separated this DVD into two entries, one ""available"" and the other ""unavailable"" other than to fool people like me into buying it without the benefit of customer reviews. This DVD is an edited version of the Rhino VHS show - which had included bonus footage as compared to the TV show aired in 1997. It's less than 60 minutes long."
1,I should have known,This DVD is unplayable in it's present format for the US system..........I did not see anywhere where it is stated
3,Hey Hey it's my Monkes review,"Hey hey Monkees fans, this is my review of the 1996 documentary about how the Monkees became part of Amrican pop culture. Ther are some very serious issues they endured under the Late Don Kirshner. His idea of creative control was mind boggling to say the least. Some amusing stories as told by the Monkees as a special feature on the VHS and DVD are ""The salad story"" They went out to a restauant to eat Davy noticed Micky digging into his salad lik a wild man. Then there's the one where the guys were chased by thousands of screaming fans. The only thing I didn't like about the documentary was Herman's Hermits singer Peter Noone running down the guys. UNACCEPTABLE!"
2,"so,so","I had made a mistake when ordering a CD of this musician,thinking that it has smth in common with works of a real genius-Klaus Schulze. But as it turned out it is rather dull and highly monotonous.May be it is too complicated for my ear?"
5,A particular Vollenweider in... Japan!!,"after Eolian Minstrel VollenWeider go back to his previous (sans lyric) style. This time it's the search for new instruments that gives you something particular. Voices became again just ""another instruments"" in the tune and the style somehow remind me of a lost medieval Japan world."
4,Incomplete but still wonderful,"An odd collection this. It doesn't represent ALL of their E.P. tracks. It includes many album-tracks which most fans will have already. And, most annoyingly, with so many excellent b-sides not included, there's EMPTY SPACE at the end of the first CD which could have been utilised!! That said, the music is still amazing, beautiful, heavenly. The gripes and groans posted elsewhere in regards to Alison's voice are empty gestures. Like Dylan and Cohen, either you get past the voice and wallow in the sonic heaven, or you don't. Cranes have always been one of the more original outfits to emerge from the UK... epic sweeping songs, droning beats, and vocals which drip like treacle around the listener's head. It's not a good starting point (nor is it very complete); all the same, this collection is HIGHLY recommended."
2,Not the closest cut,"The Classic 76 appears to be a real solid clipper and is probably great for many hair cutting tasks. However, I purchased it for one very specific purpose and it did not measure up. I keep my head shaved clean and I want the closest cut I can get from a trimmer as my skalp is too sensitive for a blade or an electric face shaver. The reviews indicated that with the 00000 blade you will get the closest to a razor that you can get from a clipper/trimmer. Not so. I was disappointed. My Andis T Outlinner cuts much closer than the Oster Classic 76. If you want a clean bald look then I would recommend the Andis T Outlinner over the classic 76. I would suggest to Oster that they come out with a 000000 blade to accomodate those of us who are seeking a very close cut. As I said earlier, the Oster Classic 76 clipper is very solid and I would love to keep it if they make a closer blade for it."
3,Heavy and hot!,"While these clippers might be great for the professional, trying to use them yourself can be quite a task. They are very heavy and bulky, and get very HOT when used for more than a few minutes. Also when using the #00000 blade, it will cut the hell out of you if you're not careful. I have had a few cuts because of these clippers. Also do not plan on traveling with these, they weight a ton and are way to big for normal use."
4,Good product but a bit too heavy,I love this hair clipper compare with other brands and models. It is powerful and the motor just keeps going and going. Only issue is this hair clipper is heavy and holding over 10 or 15 minutes your wrist will get tired.
4,Profesional Grade,"This hair clipper is very good and looks like it will last for years. I have been cutting my hair with clippers for almost 10 years now and this is the BEST clipper I ever had. The only reason I didn't give the 5 stars is styling (it must really have been designed in 1976) and weight. That thing is heavy, it is ok if you cut other peoples hair but if you cut your own, like I do, then you would like it to be a little lighter."
5,AMERICAN MADE - THE BEST!,"I bought this clipper ten years ago, and use it at least twice a month.It continues to run like it's new to this very day.Over the years I've invested in Oster stainless steel blades (9 different blades).Now I've settled on 0A as my default blade.I have saved thousands of dollars in haircuts over the years!My wife helps me with the haircuts - I think I'll keep her too.This is a mainstay in my grooming routine and hope to keep it until I no longer need haircuts.(hopefully a long, long time)Made in America and smacks of old fashioned quality!Americans build the best products-hopefully this clipper stays American-made."
5,Best Clippers ever,"I have been out of Barber School for a year, I was told about the clippers and thought their was no way the clippers could be that good..Boy was I wrong!!! The best money can buy...The motor is very strong, easy to handle. Product was at my door within 2 days.. Amazon had the best price on the clippers.I recevied as a christmas giftThanks AmazonHeather"
4,"great, just broke in half","I just finished using these great clippers. was cleaning up when they fell off the cabinet. 1sst time using them outta the box. The body of the clippers broke right below the blades. DONE. THEY are finished. I thought i could have these for years to come. THey fell onto a marble floor. i dont think it is a manufacture defect. its my fault. i though they would take at least a couple drops though, being professional quality."
4,Better then the cheap ones,I thought it worked better than the cheap ones you buy in local stores but a little to high in price. I will see how it out last the others like Wahl.
3,Some good some bad,"I was waiting impatiently for the classic 76 after hearing it described as the king of clippers. I was disappointed to noticed that in using it with the ""0"" or ""1"" blade would catch and pull on my hair. Does this happen to anyone else?"
2,well.....,"The problem I had with this product is that about after 15-20 minutes of use it got really hot, I'm not sure if it was just the one I got or do they all do this but I have owned many clippers and never have had this happen. I guess I'm just going to stick with buying Wahl brand clippers. I returned them and Amazon promptly refunded me. Kudos to Amazon, they get 5 stars."
1,sub par performance,"I'm really disappointed in these things. For that price, i was hoping for better... my cordless oster does a way better job than these, it's too bad that i broke of the 2 most important guards (#1 and #1.5 ) for that one though."
1,To dang loud,I've been using these for a few years and really don't like them. They are extremely loud and get hot a bit to quick. I don't recommend them especially when cost is considered. Mine for for sale and I'm buying Andis.
4,Misleading Title,"Hello everyone. I want to compliment Oster on such a well built machine. It has unmatched power for a pair of electric hair clippers. I do want to let everyone know that the item description is incorrect. I was exited to be getting the two agion blades as stated in the product information. Amazon had the best price if it had indeed came with the 2 agion blades. You can imagine my disappointment when I opened the box to discover it came with the 2 standard blades. Now I am frustrated, because I am not going to return the clippers because it came with the wrong blades. I will on the other hand not shop with Amazon anymore. I do not like dishonesty, so I will be taking my business elsewhere! I hope this review helps someone else from making a mistake with this purchase.Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper"
5,"EXCELLENT CLIPPER, GREAT INVESTMENT!!!","The Oster 76 replaced a worn out Wahl trimmer. I was pretty pleased w/ the Wahl but decided to purchase this trimmer based upon its reputation as an industry standard and great reviews. I was not disappointed. This clipper goes through my tough beard like a hot knife through warm butter. There is no comparison in terms of cut or quality w/the Wahl. Sure its more than twice as much but I feel the quality is 3 or 4 times the Wahl. It's got a kind of old school look about it. It won't win any beauty contests but I'm not that anal. I wish I had purchased this clipper sooner. Big time saver too. Makes quick work of my beard. Never realized how much time I was wasting before. Step up in class, you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,Just bought theses Hair Clippers,"I received the Classic 76 hair clipper. This hair clipper is by far the best set I have owned. I have been cutting my hair for over ten years and believe me, I know a good pair of clippers. I used the 000 size blade attachement that comes with the Clippers without a problem. The clippers zipped through with no problem. I was done shaving my head faster than usual. I just ordered the 00000 size cutting blade attachment to get an even closer cut. I am impressed. By the way, this clipper is not loud like the cheap home cutting kits that are sold by Wahl or Andis. Another bonus of owning this hair clipper is that the internal and external components can be replaced just by ordering through the Oster company. I'm sure this will be the last pair of hair clippers I'll ever have to buy."
5,Great Product,Simple. Basic. Reliable. This is my second Oster product. I highly recommend this product.Easy to maintain (see youtube video). John
2,"If you're just looking for a quick head&beard shave, you may prefer Andis 04710","I bought this for all-head shaving, including beard. I don't like spending time with wet shaving and normal dry beard shavers don't work for me. I like to have the same hair length (as short/bald as possible) everywhere. No hair-salons, no wasted time, no fuss. Bought this as a replacement for Andis 04710. Got the Oster in combination with the 00000 blade, as I thought it would be shorter than the Andis. It's not. It's also less convenient to shave as the Oster 76 is very big. The Andis is the best for fast short head and face shaving I've come across, and it's cheaper."
5,Awesome and Powerful,"Love everything about it... exhaust fan, powerful, and extremely user-friendly. Cord is heavy duty. Only thing about it is no case. Box is bad"
4,Professional Quality,"No doubt professional quality. The clippers I had before would struggle to cut thick hair, but these guys don't tug or pull at all. You could probably trim the hedges with these things. On the down side, you will need to purchase additional blades or plastic guards since only two blades come with the set. Also the clippers are rather large and bulky, which is a little awkward at first. Overall I would recommend this product if you are looking for a reliable heavy duty clipper and don't mind the extra size and weight."
4,Oster Classic 76,"These clippers are serious stuff. I went from some no name brand to these. It was like jumping from a Moped to a Harley Davidson. I think I am in over my head, ha, ha. After 4 haircuts I am still not use to them. I am a bit concerned that they run a little hot. I made sure they were properly oiled and greased, but they still run hot after about 10 minutes. These clippers are so heavy duty that I feel like I should wear safety glasses while operating. The body of unit is a bit bulky especially with me holding the mirror and trying to switch from hand to hand. These clippers do what they are meant to do and it is not there fault that I do not know how to use them. I plan on using these for years to come and expect to get better with practice."
5,Great Purchase,"I've cut my hair off and on for about 10 years now, and had always done so with cheaper clippers. There is hardly even a comparison between these and the $25 - $50 pairs you find at local stores. They're exactly what I was hoping for and needing."
5,clippers,after many years of cutting my own hair with $30-ish clippers....i finally decided to get a professional clipper.. for those of you that cut your own hair...throw or give away those cheap clippers. this will be the only 1 you will ever need!!
3,Arabian Jazz,"I have read three of Diane Abu Jaber's novels, and this was my least favorite. I did not identify with the characters as easily as I did in her other novels, and the story and characters were not as believable The main characters in Crescent and The Language of Baklava were more real, and the plots were more engaging."
3,interesting,Interesting but not super as her novel Crescent was. Crescent was really a wonderful novel that I have given as a gift to many friends. I was hoping to feel this way about Arabian Jazz.
2,Not Very Good,"This book bounces between the cute and the cliche. The reader feels there is a real story-teller waiting to get out, but suffocating under the author's clumsy craftsmanship. The immigrant ""experience"" is not deconstructed but frozen into solid pieces narrative, into obvious encounters with bigots and identity confusion/pursuit. My best advice is that the potential reader should get the book out of library and save the cash for another book that will deserve a re-read."
4,Henrichsen?,"Well, I have never been a fan of Brett Henrichsen and the Masterbeat labels. They usually mix a variety of music on a CD and no powerful no. 1's that everyone listens to. THis CD is the exact opposite. It has all the hottest songs from 2001/02 Awesome! The first CD is just raw attitude and it tells it like it is with my personal favorites like Body--by Faith Trent that held the no one spot on the Billboard Dance chart a while ago and I DOn't Want You--Widelife. They brought out the DIVA brigade. However, when you get to the second CD don't expect so much. CD one varies from tribal to strong vocals CD two is more club music most of which doesn't do alot for me but they are decent mixes of popular songs. I have heard better mixes of Gloria Gaynor's I never knew."
1,Disappointed,"Installed the net on our frame and within 2 hours of playing, the bottom vinyl border had pulled apart leaving a large 3 foot long hole. Net also tore in 2 places. Very poor construction. If you like to repair nets every hour, this one's for you."
5,The best of Vera Lynn,Another great CD with excellent sound. Brought back a lot of memories of that time period.
5,Amazing service,The product was exactly what I ordered and I have enjoyed it tremendously. The best part was the vendor's pricing ad service. It cost me under $10 which included shipping! That was great for a CD with 20 songs on it. The best part was the shipping time - not sure of the exact number but I think it arrived from the UK in 4 days! It takes longer than that if I send a letter to a neighboring state!GREAT ALL AROUND!
3,Some black marks on the felt,"Compared to another two sided felt I bought a couple of years ago for the same price, this one wasn't so great. The felt was a little thin, which meant the creases were somewhat more 'set' in it, but my major gripe is that there were permanent black marks on the felt in a couple places on one side. They could be grease or oil or ink from some phase of construction, not sure.Luckily I was using it for the other side, but if you are taking the trouble to buy a gaming felt for a project or event, you are doing it to give that additional level of polished appearance and having a stained felt is unacceptable."
4,Good for the price,"The felt is great. I gave it four stars because the Red on the roulette side is a bit faded. That doesn't stop me from have a great time with my family and friends. Some people think the roulette is included, IT'S NOT. I just want to make that clear. For the price, I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
4,great for the price,The felt is good strong quality but the only thing is that the creases are basically set in. I tried ironing it but they came back after a few days. but other than that its a good quality product.
4,Beautiful teaching!,"This is an excellent DVD. Sakyong is the real deal and his teaching is deeply insightful and humorous (the ultimate sign of enlightenment). It is a great introduction to Buddhist philosophy and the importance of meditation -from a genuine master. The 21 minute ""guided meditation"" however, is not a guided meditation. It is more of a very thorough instruction on how to meditate."
2,Gag-licious,"This mix produces biscuits that are heavy, gritty, and unpleasant tasting. We've ways eaten uncooked wheat flour biscuit dough. By comparison, this dough has a distinct spit-in-the-trash flavor. I'm giving credit for the unimpressive taste to the garbanzo bean flour - just my personal opinion. If you try this mix, have plenty of gravy on hand for smothering. I can't say we hated it, but we definitely didn't like it. I doubt I'll ever buy it again nor would I recommend it."
2,hard no rise,"If i try this again I will be doubling the milk and butter. If you go by the directions the biscuits just sit in the pan and turn brown, no rising or fluffiness."
1,New to Gluten Free products,I am new to buying gluten free products.I bought another brand it turned out good.(Namaste)I bought this product and tryed making bread and cinniamon bread with it. WHile fixing it I tryed some of the dough and it made me feel sick to my stomach.(and the taste wasnt appealing) I thought ok maybe its just because its not cooked. After it was done I ate some of it not to bad had a strong nut taste to it. But within an 1/2hour I wasnt feeling very good. Like when I tryed the raw dough. I dont think Im going to buy this one again. Thankfully I got this from our health food store and I dont have anymore hanging around.I will just try to make sure Garbanzo bean flour is not in my future purchases.
1,Attempted Pancakes with this...,"and I was very disappointed. I'm the GF one in the family, newly diagnosed, and just one finger in the batter let me know that this was not going to be good. I couldn't even get myself to try the finished product. My husband and son gave it a go, but the smell alone almost turned my husband away. Pancakes usually get eaten up around here...even with syrup, one was a chore to get down."
4,Great for a Gluten Free Biscuit mix!,"They were thick, like Bisquick biscuits. They tasted great. Would be WONDERFUL in Chicken & Dumplings...The only thing I did wrong when making them, was using Bob's Red Mill sAll purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in. It made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans... yuck! I used White Rice flour, and they tasted great ;)For a ""buttery"" flavor, put butter (or, if you are GFCF a non-casien containing margarine spread) on the top for a taste similar to KFC. Taste great with jelly in the middle, too. :) I froze the unbaked ""left-over"" biscuits, and they turned out well 2 months later. :)"
4,What is Economics?,Becker has written his view over the scope and method of economic analysis. And he argues that economics is a particular way in analyzing human behavior. This is an excellent presntation on the meaning of economics.
4,"Ruins are the new wave, or at least i can hope","Yeah...well...what can i say. This is ruins album number 3 for me and i like to hear the same track on different albums to get a different view of the same piece. Agressive but beautiful, this sums up this album to me. My only complaint is that the drums sound like crap. The playing is awesome but they sound like they were recorede with kmart mics. Cant wait to see these guys live."
1,very upset,"did not get to watch the movie cause something is wrong with it, i got it new and it will play at all i think it is a blank disk"
4,Classic Re-lived,Hard to find classic; I was happily surprised to find this title on Amazon. Never get tired of seeing this since the first time I seen it at the movies as a youngster. Great movie; try the next one too: Gator which picks up where white lightning leaves off.
5,Awesome Movie,"I Am Gator McKlusky! Only afraid of 2 things, Women and the PoliceOne of the best movie lines ever, you have to see this movie if you haven't already"
5,Burt is GATOR!,"Burt stars as Gator McKlusky a moonshine runner serving time in a Arkansas prison. His brother is killed by a corrupt sheriff (Ned Beatty), so Gator agrees to go undercover to exspose the sheriff and get his brothers killer. The action is awesome. Car chases, brawls and Burt's signature humor. The DVD transfer is good but sadly the film is FULL FRAME and not WIDESCREEN. I guess MGM figured only rednecks would buy such a film and didn't bother with a 16x9 transfer. And no the film is not edited the language was re-dubbed in parts of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT also to get a PG rating, cinema was only PG or R rated in the 70's. The 1976 classic GATOR is the sequel."
4,The Forgotten Cool of Burt Reynolds,"I caught WHITE LIGHTNING on cable and what's interesting to me is how lean, mean and cool Burt Reynolds was. The problem is that too many of Burt's horrible later films have been rotated to death on cable TV and you forget how much macho charisma Burt had. Forget STROKER ACE, CANNONBALL RUN 2, SMOKEY & THE BANDIT 2.In the early 70's, Burt was kicking butt and taking dames.WHITE LIGHTNING also had a great supporting cast, including R.G. Armstrong, Bo Hopkins and Ned Beatty as a very sinister and corrupt Southern sheriff.Like DELIVERANCE, this movie is one to see for Burt Reynolds the actor, or at least the icon."
3,This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your TV and edited for content,"This is just like watching the film 30 years ago on the movie of the week. If you buy this DVD, you should know:""This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your TV and edited for content""Surprised me. I've never had a DVD that was cleaned up for TV before. At least they cut out the commercials.As to the film, it's no masterpiece like ""Deliverance."" On the other hand, people under 40 probably have no idea what the ""cool"" ""pre-Smokey"" Burt Reynolds was like. This should give them a clue.-rei"
1,unusable,"Even though I lived in Europe years ago and long enough to know the difference between PAL and NTSC, it's been so long since I've had to make the discrimination that I'd forgotten that factor.I never considered that ""White Lightning"" might be in a PAL format, so I never checked; therefore, this DVD was useless upon receipt. Know the format before you order!"
1,WHITE LIGHTNING,"When I got the DVD I found it was region 2 which is PAL system. I am an engineer that work for Magnavox for over 20 years, I would know what Region 2 is, it's PAL system, not NTSC. I got screwed."
3,Cannot viewit or Play it!,"The DVD was sent from Europe or distributed in Europe. It has a setting on The DVD as 2, which cannot be played or use on any DVD player in the USA. The movie is great, But I cannot view it. I guess I just learned something. I will never buy another DVD/Video thru Amazon.Thomas Albrecht"
4,Wheres The Other Five,Click go the shears boys click click clickWide is his blow as his hands move quickMy version goes for 96 mins leaves plenty of holes in the plotwhy do studios continue to hack away at original releasesand bring out flawed pirated type copies??4.5 Stars For Cool Hand Burt & 0 For the Shearers
1,White Lightning,Buyer Beware. I share the same opinion as Cisco/Dec 2011. This company did not advertise the DVD as being a Zone 2 which will not play anywhere in the USA. Sending the item back is not worth the freight charges.
2,Dirty movie,This is o.k if your in the mood for it. White Lightning is a quiet type subdud movie. when you watch it you get kind of a dirty feeling of sweaty hot poor towns and smelly sweaty people. there is alot of cigarette smoking in it and you just get a hot southern feeling of poverty. People in this movie look like they need a shower bad especially Burt Reynolds. But the acting is pretty good and overall I think it has a good story line but just dont eat a cheese sandwich watching it because the people are pretty rugged and dirty and kind of smelly looking.
5,Great book....,"I find it unfortunate this book has received such poor reviews thus far. I find it to be quite excellent. The review that claims the book is mostly made up of cheesy line art is a joke. If you can speak from nothing but ignorance of the subject, please don't speak at all. To the person who directed their review at the company, don't take it out on the book please. I too ordered a copy. Back in April I believe. I haven't received mine either. I simply bought one from Amazon. This book is filled with new and old art, spanning the various incarnations of the Transformers. For the most part the art is fantastic. Personally, I only found one dissapointing illustration in the whole book. Other that that, perfection. Looking foward to part two. On a positive note, the company responsible for the book, will not handle orders for the second book. So hopefully, they won't be screwing anybody else over. Thank you for reading this review."
3,Art of Transformers is neat but not necessary...,"I am a HUGE Transformers fan and a Freelance Artist. So the Art of The Transformers Volume 1 was right up my alley. Right?This book has 50 percent cheasy comic booky line drawings most with choppy colors. Some Art by the Dreamwave teams and some unknowns are pretty good with great textured digital colors and unique interpretations of bodies and sparks. But most are either REALLY poor drawings or characters I've never heard of. They're heart was in it, I guess.But the rest of the book has highlights such as the awsome 2 part cover and 30 percent painted (some look airbrushed) Art that is very similar to the actual G1 box Art. There is a section on the Dinobots (in robot mode) that is really AWSOME!If you are into the Mainframe TV shows, there are a few original images with the ""wireframe"" characters all colored in their animalistic glory...I would recomend this book used and I value it around $15 bucks.Here's to Volume 2..."
1,Waiting for a year for this book and I am still waiting?,"This review is aimed at the publisher and not the book itself since dispite paying for this book last Feb. I still have not recived it. I get canned email responses to my emails. They charged my credit card back in Feb. with delay after delay in shipping. Not only that it is ten dollars less here and shipped in 24 hours. The publisher needs ""customer service"" 101. If you want it, get the book here and not the website."
5,A Classic Collectors Item,"For those of us who grew up with Generation One, this book is worth it. New imagages from creative artists are dsiplayed from all Transformers series, that will captivate hardcore fans. I recomend this book as a must for collectors.Garrick Boomer"
5,Perfection,"Lamp has been installed and working flawlessly and for a fraction of the ""OEM"" cost! Thinking about getting a second one just to have a spare!"
1,Lamp already burnt out in 3 months,"I would like to express my extreme disappointment with this item. The lamp burned out in 3 months of use. We do not use the projector during the week and on the weekends we watch movies and TV for a total of about 3 hours/day. The last lamp I had lasted 3 years with this amount of use. This one needs to be replaced in 3 months. I think Amazon should replace the lamp but there seems to be no option to file a complaint, only to return the item but the window for that has expired."
1,Utterly bad !,"This book is really the worst book on C++ one can possibly buy. It tries to be academic and deep by making 'hard to understand' language concepts even harder and by making the easier ones as inaccessible as Salomon's cave. If you're a nerd and desperately seeking your mum's adoration for doing something completely useless with your time, then go for this book. Anything you can learn from it, you can learn it faster and with far less frustration from other C++ books around (Like Lipmann's C++ Primer). I fed this book to my dog."
3,Hail impact on roofs,"Informative, but old (1960ish), skimpy (9 pages), and little statistical data or background provided for how the tables were generated."
3,Good if you have a basis,"Parker's Astrology is a lavishly detailed and gorgeous book that gives not only explanations of signs, houses, and all that good stuff, but also explains in detail how to derive every sort of chart one would expect from a single omnibus book on the subject.The book has a failing though in interior organization. Items are scattered about without any sense of order I could find. Concepts and procedures would be introduced and then not utilized until dozens of pages later. The writing is a bit colloquial at times, and definitely not the most accessible. Having read through the book twice, I am still not completely sure what a 'progression' is, though I know how to generate one.Overall, I think this book would be an excellent second book for one with a confirmed interest and background in astrology, but for someone just starting to learn, a different source might be more useful."
4,"Good buy! Although, some parts of it are hard to follow.","If you are good at math, this would be a good book. I'm not, but I could still follow how to make most of my natal chart information. It is a great reference book, and I use it often to look up certain characteristics. A great book to have!"
4,A wonderful book for beginners and intermediary students,"I found this book to be comprehensive, well organized and easy to read. It is beautifully illustrated and well put together. Congratulations to the Parkers on this great book."
3,But is it accurate,"I bought this book so that I could learn to draw up my own natal birth chart. Rather than use a calculator, I decided to use a spreadsheet to do the calculations. I found numerous errors in the data and the example charts, and some of the processes are not fully explained. Some of the errors are due to rounding, some are simply misprints which are then carried throughout the rest of the charts. Having said that, and with the co-operation of the authors, I was able to complete the task and despite the frustrations arising from the above, if the end result works, the book does it's job."
4,Aries Girl,"I love the illustrations and I love the description of each and every sign. This book has helped me make important choices in my life. It has taught me to observe my general attitude and control my impulsiveness. Something I may have never noticed without it. My only wish is that the Parkers could help me make my birthchart, it seems way too complicated for the astrologically uneducated mind."
1,frustrating,"i wonder if ANYONE has ever successfully create a chart using this book. it is poorly written, very confusing, and has left me frustrated and baffled. if you're looking for a guide to do-t-yourself charts, look elsewhere."
5,Great Book!,"Great book! Very informative for a person who is just starting to really dive deep into Astrology! The birth chart seems a little tricky, so I would recommend getting help from a person with some Astrology experience/background. I am a firm believer you can never have too many good Astrology books, and this one is one to add to the collection! :)"
5,A multiverse in a book!,"I first heard of Cliff Pickover while exploring fractals and strange attractors as art, and eventually I found myself hearing more and more about this prolific author.Eventually I had the opportunity to read this book.A scrapbook of a great mind, allowing us to follow the Moebius strip through history as a mathematical entity and as a metaphor for everything from the process of learning to the very nature of our universe. It's a fascinating and accessable read for the incredibly thought provoking nature of the information therein; sharing in Pickovers' enthusiasm and imagination makes it even more so. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and look forward to reading it again, as well as tracking down more of Pickovers' work.If I could compare it to anything in current literature, it'd be Simon Winchesters' Krakatoa."
4,Good for the beginner,"I found this book to be pretty comprehensive in getting me up and running in LabView. The book covers just about every aspect of labview, but don't expect to become an expert after reading it. It doesn't go into great detail of say how to use arrays or how to manage data. It is very easy to follow and the examples are all very good as well. It also gives you solved files of all the VI's you have to set upyourself.My one big gripe about the book is that the figures that show you what your VI should look like are NEVER on the same page where they are mentioned. I got real annoyed having to flip back and fourth through the pages in each practice VI.All in all I would recommend this book for the beginner who wants to get a clearly explained overview of LabView. Don't expect to be an expert, but you can plan on being proficient in the program when you are through."
2,"Comprehensive, but organization could be better","To be fair, this is an excellent compendium of all the promises of the bible. However, it suffers from a somewhat encyclopedic approach, that is, it is chock-full of information but not eminently readable. As a reference book, it suffers from the lack of a useful index. That leaves the only other alternative, which is to endeavour to read it cover to cover. The latter is not such a ridiculous thought; after all, the promises of God are so exciting that they should be fully devoured. Unfortunately, again, Lockyear's presentation of the material makes this a difficult task. It is a pity, because I am sure there are many, many gems to be found. The accompanying commentary is also sometimes very insightful. Alas, after this, I am still searching for a book that classifies all the promises in the Bible - all 8,810 of them - in a simple manner!"
2,"Difficult to read, will look for another","Rarely do I find a book that disappoints like this one did. The interior pages are like newsprint - a cheaper quality paper than a traditional paperback, and the text is formatted into two columns per page, making the font size very small.There seems to be no division on the promises, so it would be difficult to find anything easily. After spending a few hours with it, I'm frustrated and am now searching for another book to replace this one."
1,The product is great but the service was lousy. You sent me the wrong product.,The product is great but the service was lousy. You sent me the wrong product. I ordered All The Prayers of the BIBLE and you sent me All The Promises Of The BIBLE. That set me back a week.
2,disappointed =(,I really wanted to like this product but all it did was dry my son's skin. Gave it a two because it smells really good.
1,mountain panoramas from the pamirs and kwen lun,"i must say this reproduction was a sad disappointment. the book is a (scanned) reproduced culturally important book, that it states has occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks etc.i guess my question would be, number one; given the title of the book, why was there not even one reproduced picture in the book that was legible, in fact some picture pages were blank, those that copied were less than 50 percent complete.my second question would be you, why are there 8 pages near the center of book that are copies of pages from june 21, 1991 copy of asiaweek magazine, which has no bearing whatsoever on the book subject matter.so, you have a book with explanations of pictures that are not present,copies of an aged magazine, an maybe 10 percent of the map that covered the subject matter in the book.please don't waste your money!"
5,"Excellent knives, highly recommended.",The best knives I have ever owned. They came highly recommended by several friends and coworkers and I am very pleased with my purchase.
1,Even Great Artists Can Make Bad Records,"In retrospect, the Explorers seem little more than a desperate effort by Phil Manzanera and Andy Mackay, two of Roxy Music's enduring members, to cash in on what scant public interest remained in the once great Roxy Music. The singer (James Wraith) tries awfully hard to mimic Bryan Ferry and all of his vocal mannerisms.But the biggest problem is the songs themselves are mere shadows of great Roxy songs or even Manzanera's productive solo period (Diamond Head through K-Scope). With the exception of the exciting Crack The Whip, all the songs here are D.O.A. Much too polite and without a whiff of energy or soul.Fortuntely, the Explorers vanished soon thereafter. I've even seen their one studio release repackaged and retitled as Manzanera and McKay.The best news is that Manzanera's Explorer experiment has done nothing to diminish what he had already accomplished over the course of a great career."
4,Clymer on BMW Boxer Twins1970-1996,"Detailed with great photo's breaking down each step. Easy to follow, simple and practical. A great help in maintining a BMW Boxer."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"I have over a decade of experience of working on motorcycles, snowmobiles, & ATVs. I bought a 1975 Beemer as a project because I have never worked on one, plus their just a cool bike period.Cons:1) There are no wire #'s associated to the wiring diagrams(in BMW Books).2) The book helps you take the bike apart not together.3) Missing many picture angles that would be helpful.4) No writing on how something should be when a picture isn't provided.Pros:1) All specs seem to be consistent.2) Covers a large range of bikes (both years and models).3) Its inexpensive.4) Its cheaper than using fire logs (doubles for starting fires)."
5,Great info for my older BMW motorcycle,"I own an older BMW GS Airhead. I do all my maintenance and work, and this book has helped me do it! It is a must own if you own an Airhead."
3,Ok but not great,"The manual is complete and includes general information about the work to be performed but is often lacking in step by step specifics that would be helpful. In addition, the fact that so many different models are covered in one text can lead to some confusion."
4,Comprehensive,"Pretty comprehensive manual considering the range of models and years it covers. I recommend putting index tabs throughout the sections you're about ready to use that are applicable to you model. Good schematics, breakdowns and fairly clear photos."
5,Best Tooth Powder,"Wow, this really is the best tooth powder. I got instant results the first time I brushed with it and my whole mouth feels dentist clean. It really whitens teeth."
3,It's OK,"It's strong ingredients may throw some folks back a bit, but I tried it.Not seeing much on the ""teeth whitening"" claims for charcoal, though it does clean well.Hard to use everyday, gotta rinse well. Worth a shot for those who can find the charcoal paste, I guess you could make a paste outta this."
1,Another gimic gone wrong!,"I always like to try crazy things and this is one of the craziest! First of all this stuff is like talcom powder but BLACK so it goes EVERYWHERE!!!! When you use it your mouth, teeth and tongue are BLACK (my tongue for hours) and it seems to splash all over everything unlike white toothpaste for reasons I don't understand. AND the SMELL! This stuff smells different than anything we ever smelled and it carries all through the house and my daughter cannot stand it. The thrill of using it wore off long ago!"
4,"Global Crises, Global Solutions - Heavy on Economics","Global Crises, Global Solutions; edited by Bjorn Lomborg, who brought us The Environmental Skeptic, has produced a collection of articles where experts attempt to prioritize which global problems should be dealt with, and how they should be solved. Although an excellent idea, the actual writing is extremely academic and not very easy to read. Essentially, the articles are a series of cost-benefit analyses on specific problems of global warming, conflict, communicable disease, etc. I am not an economist, and found the writing to be almost impenetrable at times, because the authors assume the reader has a very firm understanding of economics and economic jargon. Four stars for intent, only three stars for readability."
5,Killer Soundtrack!!!!,"Just what the title says, killer soundtrack. I love every band on it. Two lesser known and two of my favorites, Collide & Front Line Assembly grace it with thier presence. A great ""More Human Than Human"" remix, along with my favorite track from Rob Zombie's latest album, ""Lords of Salem"" (what a fitting song for the theme of the movie)."
5,Great music.,These songs are straight out of the movie. Can't get enough of this cd. Hasn't left my cd player in 6 months.
4,Great Raving Music,"It's a Soundtrack, so expect of it what you can expect of a soundtrack. Since I love tech music, I'm thrilled with it, but for someone who goes INSANE for tech and progressive, it's not DJ Tiesto and will never be. Some pieces are rather weak, but ""Predator"", ""More Human than Human"", ""Euphoria"" and ""Lords of Salem"" make it up for them.This is the kind of music that makes you want to be alone to enjoy it.I give it four out of five because it doesn't ""elevate you"". Other than that, it's cool."
1,Disappointment beyond words,"Buyer beware.....while this book ""touts"" itself as historical fiction, it is really fantasy. ""Swan"" is a Driud priestess....who is set on a ship to escape the Catholic Church who is bent on a path of elimination of her ""Sisterhood"". Bottom line, this is a book about Druid priestess....ie: throw in fantastical images of shape changing, a magic charm or two, heck, even a ""catfight"" at the end. Tedious, boring and a complete disappointment."
3,Advertised with lid...but no lid,"It's a neat item, but with no lid, even though it was advertised as having a lid. It will work as a cooler, or other uses. Quality seems good."
3,Very Good but Limited!!,"I bought this Joe Walsh collection some time ago. I must say that it is very good but it is limited.It has about all the hits up to 1978 which is when it first was released. I've seen some copies that have Life's Been Good on them. Mine does not. The artwork is alone worth the money. However if you are looking for a more comprehensive compilation than this one Joe did release ""Look what I did"" years later. I don't have it yet but you'll get more Joe for the buck."
3,One More Track,"Just tack on ""Life's Been Good"" (if you like that sort of thing).That'll bring it to ten tracks and more reasonable (ie CD) length.That song and album were released almost concurrently with this."
5,"""layers of meaty rhythm guitar""","The Millenium Collection - 20th Century Masters"" series rolls along with this wonderful ten track disc, this time we have ""The Best of Joe Walsh"". This album is ""A Plus"" from the very start, with this guitar legend hitting the mark everytime.Walsh had different priorities than recording ""Top Ten Hits"", his style and recordings were not built upon a standard issue pop hook, but were always reliable and adventurous with layers of meat rhythm guitar figures. Good example from is ""James Gang"" tenure (1969-72) ""FUNK 49"", starts with a brief intentionally out-of-context guitar solo, mixed with exotic yet catchy guitar figure with a heavy rhythm that breaks into a romp in his musical jungle.Of course there are stand outs - ""COUNTY FAIR"" a definite classic, and his dirty boogie, the pulsating ""ROCKY MOUNTAIN WAY"" one of his best, from this ""Best of Joe Walsh"". Go out and buy it, you'll be glad you did.Total Time: 47:39 on 10 Tracks"
3,Health,"When I started to take these, I initially took 2 a day and noticed some pain in my shoulders and neck. I cut back to 1 a day and don't seem to have any problemsnow. Hopefully, when I go back to the doctor, I'll find out if the capsules worked on my cholesterol."
1,awful product,"The pages on this were impossible to scratch off, even the adults couldn't do it! It was no fun and frustrating for the kids."
2,Scratch Magic Scratch and Sparkle Deluxe Kit,"Purchased as gift-contains 16 scratch off sheets however sheets are very small, about 6x6. Used up very quickly. Would have made another choice if size of sheets had been noted in the specs."
5,SUMM LIKE IT HOT!,"OUTSTANDING! This video was played at a party by one of the best DJ/VJ's ever to hit the club scene. We were gathered at a private function in honor of the club-owners b-day. In honor of the b-day boy it was a DONNASUMMER themed evening. We were treated to the new CD and Video with a dance track called I WILL GO being the most requested song of the evening. Watch Out Cher, This may be the milleniums big COMEBACK! Forget the 5 STARS - IT DESERVES 10!"
2,Be Warned! Not a true FXS/FXO device,"If you plan to use this with Asterisk, be warned. You CANNOT use this device as true independent FXS and FXO devices like you can the Linksys SPA3102. If you want to use it as a FXO (PSTN) device only, you can, but you MUST make it ANSWER the incoming call and hotline dial it to send it anywhere. If you are planning on using this with a software PBX like Asterisk, I recommend you see if you can find a good working example somewhere before you buy it. If you want to use it as a stand alone device to route 911 (and/or local) calls to a PSTN line and have it connect to a VoIP provider to save money, it will work great. If you want to use it to provide you with a FXS port and a FXO port and you'll handle the SIP traffic yourself with something like Asterisk, don't buy it."
3,Zoom Voice Over Ip Adapter,"The I articulate bought they sent it me without problems.Referring al behavior of the team, I have configured continuing the instructions but I give me account that alone him can be connected with only 1 telephone and not 2 as the publicity said,"
4,i guess no one gets it.,"Ok, for those of you who complain that this sounds like the ""result of a blurry hangover"" or wonder why it sounds so punk-esque, it's because it was recorded in 1977. Which puts it more in the Strontium 90 period, pre-Police and a long way from his solo efforts(in fact, Mike Howlett also of Strontium 90 plays bass on this single). Of course, I really like the more polished, meticulous Sting albums. But I'd have to say that my favorite Police material is definitely the ""Fallout"" single so I enjoy the gritty, raw and underproduced energy captured in this recording. An excellent example of a more youthful and vivacious Sting tackling a major issue of the time. Don't buy this expecting to hear ""Fields of Gold"". This single is for the hardcore Police fan or the Sting completist. If you're not one of these, you should probably stay clear."
3,Sting & The Radioactive - 'Nuclear Waste' (Voiceprint),"As I'm certain that I've seen this five track EP list in various places - including a Hawkwind Collector guide, I wasn't aware that it was recorded in 1995. I could've sworn it was initially released ten years prior to that. Nonetheless, I personally thought this EP is aimed toward the completists and the die-hard fans. I sort of liked the title cut ""Nuclear Waste"", the upbeat ""Spiral Diatribe"" and ""No-Ozone Blue"" (perhaps the best song here). Also liked the female vocalist - featured on a couple of tunes. Line-up: Sting & Liz Van Dort - vocals, Harry Williamson & Steve Hillage - guitar, Mike Howlett - bass, Nik Turner - sax & backing vocals and Steve Broughton (Edgar Broughton Band) - drums. Enjoy."
2,funny with lots of artists,"sting, steve hillage (gong), mike howelet(producer) and nik turner(hawkwind) are here.only 5 songs 1 and 5 are really the same song.buy it if you are a sting completist.great package job!....as for the music....ahhhh thats another story. track 1 and 5 get by, the rest don't :-)...this cd should Be filed UNDER STING !"
2,get some throat medication,"Wow. I must say I didn't know Sting was into that punk-quiescience Stewart Copeland sounding stuff anymore. I am a very loyal sting fan- who isn't of the kagillion people on the internet? Does anyone know when or what year (or what week) these songs were written? Does Sting know? Or is this just the result of a blurry hangover? I am embarrassed. This would be ok on any other day, but hey, why should I cry for him?"
2,or 3 star?-no for spasticbob...,not funny enough and kinda hard to hear him at first on this film; did he do any others that are better-yes but i forgot the name if it has one on utube.
3,OK book,"We purchased 2 other similar books along with this one. The other two featured characters she knew, so she seems to be enjoying them better. She will not sit through this entire book. Good concept and great story, just didn't keep my 2 year olds attention as well as others."
4,good game but too easy for 7 yr old boy,"I bought this for my nephew. He really liked it and had fun playing it. He's 7, and I liked that it didn't have inappropriate content for him. The only draw back was that he beat the whole game in about 2 weeks, so I guess it wasn't a very hard game."
1,Game didn't work.,"The game was too scratched and didn't work. It kept freezing. We bought the stuff to fix scratched DVD's, but it didn't work. A complete waste of money."
4,A WOMAN'S REVENGE,"Along with a few others, Steven SODERBERGH is one of the last authors-directors of the american cinema of today. He has the same problems than, before him, an Orson Welles or, closer from us, a John Sayles : how to present something personal and original and to make money and stay in the business ?The structure of THE UNDERNEATH, a loose remake of Robert Siodmak's CRISS CROSS, is very interesting. Flashbacks and flashbacks in the flashbacks. It's not as literary as it seems and, at least, it keeps the audience awake without any need of explosions.Soderbergh does an excellent work with his camera which, in its movements, often reflects the state of mind of the hero, Peter Gallagher. The scene in the hospital, in the last part of the movie, is, technically speaking, an achievement.Bonus features are of above average-quality with an interesting comparison between the letter-box and the pan and scan version.A should have a second chance DVD."
5,Very Nice,Easy to read. Plenty of detail to make it interesting. Does not contain any foo foo information or graphics plastered all over it. Works well for my 8 year old to look up places he hears about on the news.
5,very nice world map,very sturdy (laminated) map. this is a gift for my son's grandfather who travels a lot. we don't know yet if he's going to put pins in it or want to frame it. may be costly to frame. I'm going to look for a frame that would just frame corners in glass wedges with maybe cork board behind so that he can put it up on the wall tastefully but still use pins. Michelin maps are excellent. He still remembers my Michelin map that I bought in France years ago (Le Monde).
3,NOT LAMINATED.,"Large nice looking map; useful for educational purposes. However, it is NOT LAMINATED. the description makes no mention of laminated but several reviewers seem to have gotten a laminated one. disregard that part of their reviews."
3,NOT laminated!,"I thought this was laminated, so was pretty disappointed to find out it wasn't. This is for the schoolroom, so I'm afraid it won't last as well as I would like. Otherwise a beautiful map."
3,New World Parts,"After the break up of the USSR, a few countries in Asia and Europe split. This map helped me find and know the name of the new countries."
2,Inept law officers,"OK--two law officers are lying in lawn chairs on a beach late at night. They spot a boat off shore with a running light coming in to shore in an area when summer homes are not as yet opened for the summer. The boat docks, a figure with a flashlight leaves the boat, goes into a home, does not turn on any lights, and shortly thereafter returns to his boat, and goes away. OK--these two law officers are in the area to investigate a handfull of thefts in summer homes not opened for the season and they do not investigate what they have just seen. They do not jump to their feet and run down the shore to see what is going on. What do they do. They idly wonder what the boater is doing (this in the middle of the night) and go back to whatever it was they were talking about. Nothing could save the book for me after this episode."
3,techno a new dimension fir a new era,"this is not your typical techno. no 2 unlimited, cappella or any old skool. this is out and out undergoound techno. the only reason why this cd is not rated higher is that most of ther tracks take too long ot get going. the nbest cd is disc 2 witht he likes of the blue zone mix and cubase. (tracks 8 and 10 of cd2) trust me if you can find this get it. Underworld was a little disappointing. GET IT WHEN YOU CAN!"
1,Important Character... Wasted DVD,"The idea of creating a DVD compiling the adventures of a major ""Buffy"" character is interesting, however, Spike's evolution doesn't end here. This only features early episodes from Spike's journey.I reccomend that you not buy this dvd because this doesn't follow suite. By releasing four different episodes, which by the way are are not in sequence with the MAJOR ""Buffy"" Storyline, you can't follow along.Spike is the celebrity here, but Spike wasn't the only character to care about. Spike's storyline only seems important to me to when it is combined with the entire story."
1,I Like Spike But I Think This DVD is A Waste!,Buffy the Vampire Slayer is my favorite show and I like James Marsters (Spike). Spike was the reason I started watching this show but I think it's very silly to buy this DVD which only has a few random Spike episodes and since the ten dollars back coupon is now expired the excuse that you wind up getting the DVD for free just doesn't hold up! If you don't own this show on DVD yet just buy the individual seasons or the new 40 disk complete series DVD package!
2,"I like Spike, but...","I've never really understood the point of releasing little sets like this when everything in them is duplicated in a season set. Sure, I'd buy a new set of Buffy DVDs...if they were actually, you know, new. I already have all seven seasons of Buffy and all five of Angel, so what would this give me that I don't already have? A $30 completion? Please."
2,Be aware.....,"I bought this DVD thinking it was some kind of special features of the show Buffy with many appearances of Spike (James Marsters) but what a disappointment. All there is on this DVD is 4 episodes of Buffy which included Spike in them. If you already have all 7 seasons of Buffy, you've seen those 4 episodes. There is also a little bit of special features with Spike, but again, these were included in one of the seasons of Buffy. Granted the DVD is not expensive, but still a waste of money when you have all of Buffy's seasons. I gave it a 2 stars because even though I was disappointed of the content of this DVD, I still think Buffy is a great television serie!"
1,Bad,"I don't know what charts they used to call these great hits, but most of the songs on this CD were never played on a radio station I was listening to, and I listened to pop and rock."
5,What he knows,"This is a controversial, but I believe to be truthful book by one of the great living banjo players of our time. It engendered a lot of vitriol among bluegrass fans, as Butch is at times unkind in his assessment of some well-known bluegrass stars who were less than kind to him and others over the years. It's a great read for those familiar with the bluegrass ideom and who can let their star-worship fall by the wayside long enough to experience a bit of truth."
1,LOST ON THE OCEAN FLOOR : DIVING THE WORLD'S GHOST SHIPS,"I was really disatified with this book. I just can`t really find much good to say about it. The pictures,the few that was in book were more about cannonballs and jewelry that were found on some ships.The author wrote alot about how some ships were built but didn't tell how some of the ship even looked under water or the damage they had taken to sink.In my opinion the sunken ships in the pacific ocean were not covered enough. If you are interested in sunken ships I would avoid this book at all costs."
2,real disappointment,"I'm not sure how a person writes a whole book, covering a bunch of very interesting shipwrecks, and ends up with such an un-interesting book… what's not interesting about a shipwreck… All I can figure is that it was the writing style, maybe, but I had a tough time finishing it without really skipping around. I have to believe that given the subject matter, it could have been a much much better read."
5,Clever Man Codes,This book is so clever. The code names make me laugh. It is way cool. I also love the fact that the author has been through many of these dating scenarios and gives great advice for how to handle different types of men. Smart Man Hunting is awesome!
2,I just didn't think that it presented anything new...,"This book really left me wanting something more, from the book that is. It was well written, but the material was just the same old advice I've been hearing from my friends and family for years. Also, I don't feel that the book does a good job of addressing the dating scence outside of major metro areas where I think that dating is more difficult."
4,Appealing fusion of African and Western sounds,"This was the album that gave N'Dour an international audience. It opens with the lilting The Lion/Gaiende, followed by the soulful Shakin' The Tree where Peter Gabriel contributes vocals, the lively, fast-paced Kocc Barma and Bamako, a jazzy track.Old Tucson has a charming R&B; flavor, Macoy is atmospheric and subdued, while Sama Doom is another polyrhythmic delight. N'Dour sings in both English and Wolof, his native language, but his voice is so expressive that language doesn't matter much.The instrumentation and backing vocals are elegant and graceful throughout - full marks for expert production. Although not quite as magnificent as his classic album Eyes Open, The Lion is very accessible without compromising the integrity of the artist's roots, a highly successful fusion of Western and African sounds."
5,It's Hot!,"this CD was just given to me by a friend. It was a late christmas present. i spend a lot of time on the road so I have the time to hear a lot of music. I really enjoy all of the songs and encourage anyone who travels the highway to pick up a copy. safe journey, scraper"
3,be forewarned,"while a rare and wonderful LP from one of the fall's best line ups and likely the only way you're gonna hear it, be forewarned that the CD is mastered from vinyl and that the record skips. (that's right a CD of a skipping LP)"
4,Get it just for I'm Not Scarred,"the Raindogs qualms always have a speciall place in may heart for ""I'm Not Scared"" which makes this album worth buying"
5,The best,This is the best and most informative trail guide to the Olympic Mountains. Bob Wood has hiked most of these trails himself and he has written book on the history of Olympic National Park. This book contains information you will not find anywhere else. Sadly Bob Wood has passed away and this book is getting a bit dated.
2,Does not offer degree of difficulty or description of elevation changes,"Extremely unhelpful. Does not rate trails with respect to degree of difficulty; nor does it indicate whether trail is generally level, uphill, downhill, etc. Descriptions are wordy and vague. Where was the editor?"
2,Useless for me,"As a day hiker going to the Olympics for the first time I found the book rather useless and much inferior to a day hiking book a friend brought (Day Hiking, Olympic Penisula). It is of little help in choosing which trail to do, it has poor to non-existent maps and does not give elevation change data. It is exhaustive on the mountain trails (including abandoned trails), but it does not include beach hikes, only mountain trails."
5,The best got better...,"I owned the 2nd editon for many years and it guided me on numerous trips. But there were some gaps and the age of the book was becoming noticable. So when the 3rd edition came out, I was very excited. Was I let down? NO. Wood accurately describes ever wonderful mile of these mountains and fills in the gaps present in his earlier editions. The new maps are wonderfully done (though still a bit cartoonish) and the new Trail Info summaries make life even easier. I'd recommend this book to anybody hiking anywhere in the Olympics. His 2nd edition was pretty darn good to begin with, but the 3rd some manages to improve on it."
4,Great Book,"Robert L. Wood is the recognized expert on the trails of the Olympic Mountains. I don't think a backpacker will find a better guide, but the real beauty of this book is Wood's descriptions of the trails, which can put even armchair hikers in the middle of the mountains.I guess the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the maps are terrible and you've got to buy a separate guide if you want to hike the beautiful, wild beaches of the Olympic Peninsula.A very minor quibble, considering the fine, lyric writing, is the way the trails are organized. For example, many of the named trails don't begin at trailheads, but rather from junctions at other trails. Thus if you want to plan a short hike, you must make certain the named trail does not begin 15 miles up the path of another trail."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"Don't waste time or money on this DVD!!! Total ripoff. Very hokey graphics, has very little to do with Rosslyn or Knights Templar. In between bad pics of chapel, you have graphics that look like someone's idea of a very bad LSD trip, and some old guy just spouting his own theories and retoric re: a variety of paranomal or oddities! Worst film I have EVER seen!!!"
4,Great CD for anyone who wants to know Islam,"Unlike attacks made by Stuart Maconie, Yusuf Islam puts a great CD that speaks the message of Islam (peace) to all mankind. With his humble voice and beautiful comforting hems, this CD is a must for anyone who seeks to know the *truth* about Islam."
5,An AWAIR Pick,"This was Cat Stevens / Yusuf Islam's first release since leaving the music business more than two decades earlier. It is the moving, spoken-word audio biography of the Prophet Muhammad's life. Listeners are drawn into the story by Yusuf's wonderful voice and marvelous sound-effects. Features the song sung by the first Muslims as a welcome when the Prophet arrived in Madinah.Yusuf Islam also produced this as a book, under the same title. Buy both!Teachers/Librarians: this should be an essential resource (Islam's primary sources after all)for study of Islam and Muslim history at any age level. . . social studies/humanities."
5,GET BEHIND THE MULE!,"Gov't Mule is one of the best live bands out there today and this album definitely shows that. The interplay between Woody, Matt, Warren and company is fantastic. Jimmy Herring smokes on ""3rd Stone from the Sun"" while Marc Ford tears up the guitar on a few tracks himself. Randall Bramblett is a shining star offering his sax on a few songs that catapult you into another world. The bluesy rock driven ""Look on Yonder Wall"" is enough to make any party come alive. Get all 4 1/2 hours of music! Don't cheat yourself by buying the 2 disc version. Trust me, you won't regret it. This has to be one of my all-time top 3 live albums......yeah, it's that good. If you want more live Mule, check out ""Live at Roseland"" and the soon to be released ""The Deepest End."""
4,Pretty Good,"This CD was a gift. It is very inspiring and is a good acoustic version of Government's Mule stuff. If you are a fan, you'll like this one."
2,BE WARY OF RAVE REVIEWS,"I BOUGHT THIS BOX SET BASED ON REVIEWS READ ON THIS SITE THAT IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY. WELL, IT'S NOT! THE FIRST DISC IS REALLY GOOD AND I KEPT PLAYING IT TILL I REALIZED THERE WERE MORE. HOWEVER, WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF REPEATING THE FIRST CD, DISCS 2,3, AND 4 FALL SHORT OF BEING WORTHY OF CONTINUED PLAYING. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING CHEAPER. THE PRICE FOR THIS BOX SET IS TOOOO MUCH!I WOULD GLADLY SELL IT TO SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED FOR HALF THE PRICE IF THEY WANT IT."
4,Lonesome Dove TV,This DVD set is a must have for Lonesome Dove fans. The two TV shows are in one place and that is a good deal.
3,Not what I was expecting,This is not the entire collection of Lonesome Dove that I was expecting. It is a different tv series more like Bonanza than the Mini-Series.
3,over dramatized boring western,"This series has way to much drama, and way to little action to be a real western.Having a very hard time to keep watching. AND THIS IS JUST THE FIRST DISK, 9 MORE TO GO, going to be a very looong series to get through. The women seem to have bigger balls then the men, and the men seems to be pussy whipped. I've seen a lot better and more action at the circus. Wish I had saved my money or had bought some real westerns. if it weren't for the name louis lamore, I would swear that this was written by a woman"
4,Engrossing,This series shows how life was in this time of history and how at times life had little meaning and how values have changed.The acting and the scenery is excellent.
4,Great entertainment,"Offers great entertainment. Acting is weak in spots, but overall very enjoyable. Recommended for western fans. Great late night fare with popcorn!"
3,not good for hearing impaired,I never knew dvds not to have sub titles. I guess i should have asked first. i had to give it away
5,lonesome dove,"One of nthe best westerns ihave seen.So true to the old west.The actors are so good,and the towns and buildings are just great.I will see this movie manny times."
2,"I like this classic western,",The western shows the determination of the people in the west to build a frontier. I really enjoyed watching Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall in this role.
1,HORRIBLE,"This, without a doubt, is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is incredibly bad. Moreover, the cover -- showing nice looking men frolicking -- is very misleading. None of the actors are physically or emotionally attractive. I think my 2 year old nephew could have put a more coherent movie together."
2,An attempted rip-off,"If the scale of really bad to really good ran from the west coast to the east, this film would be placed somewhere in Japan. This is the gay equivalent of ""let's put on a play in the barn"", probably going something like ""I have enough money for film and processing, so we'll be the actors and we'll use New York and Provincetown as scenery"". THere is no cohesion, no discernable plot, obviously no script. Why bother? I don't even know why I am bothering to write a review, except in the hope of preventing someone from wasting time or money."
1,lie down with dogs,dont waste your money. would rather have watched attack of the killer tomatoes again.
1,Not much fun,This movie was a total waste of my time. I had to stop it mid way because it was so juvenile. Not recommended to anyone.
3,oh god..give me a break,"I saw the thing years ago, but I don't remember it being that bad. Okay, it wasn't the second coming of christ, and its fixation with youthful sexuality was a little alienating, but the lead character said from the start that it was his story. there was a little rant in the beginning about how some people were not going to like it. What the heck? It wasn't meant to be picked apart and analyzed; just 90 minutes of ""gay life"". or one guy's perspective. At least they were real gay men, not these gay for pay straight dudes. Stay away from ""Jack"". Ron Silver must have done that one for the money. Some uncredited actors do the kissing, and Mr. Silver just mugs his way through. ""Jack"", the kid, is a relentless whiner. Now that was a bad picture. You've been warned."
1,The Worst Movie I Ever Saw --- and I've Seen Hudson Hawk,"What can i say... how can i get back the 1.5 hours of my life that this movie took up. I vow never to sit through this kind of a movie again. I own many ""gay"" movies, ... this one should not be seen at any cost."
1,"stupid, dumb, non-sense!!!",What the hell is this movie?!? If I want to watch Randy Becker I would go for Love! Valour! Compassion! instead of this movie!!!
2,Poor acting,"I disagree with most of the unfavorable reviews that center around the fact that the main character is self centered and the movie is overall vapid. That WAS the point of the movie. And a light thing is always good every once in a while.However, the acting is really quite atrocious. None of the actors look like they acted prior to shooting this film. The only one that does not over-emphasize every expression or syllable is Ben, the object of Tommie's affection. But overall, if the acting had been any better, the movie would actually be a nice, light-hearted cute effort..."
3,Vapid Vac,"Those overwhelmingly critical (one star) of White's depiction of ""gay""-cationing perhaps have never connected with people on a superficial level before; hence, their repulsion. Those who have been burned by gay circuits WILL see sides of that milieu parodied (read: criticized) in this film, and for this we can ""thank"" Wally. This is a very weak effort in terms of a deep queer cinematic experience, but the movie does not pretend to be a Hanging Garden or a Longtime Companion (Wally says so in the film). Not all of gay life is serious drama and sober intellect, nor should we expect all gay perspectives/ artistic expression to be so. Some will get it, others won't."
5,I featured this book in my novel.,"I read this in law school in 1985. I was so impressed that I featured its concepts in my own novel, ""By Force Of Patriots,"" published in 2012."
5,Life changing,Simply put: this book can change your life for the better. I was able to recognize things I have struggled with my whole life but was unable to identify what they were. This brought me a sense of peace I had not experienced in any other book.
5,excelent book,"this one is perfect for someone who is in codependent relationship...it explains facts in a very easy way... perfect book, so far..so good!!"
2,"DRAGONFLIES IS A ""DRAG.""","Being a big fan of Anthony's I found this album to be overly self expressive and perhaps a bit self indulgent. The reason Anthony is so brilliant is because he has the ability to produce some truly powerful stuff when he wants to. Though his acoustic prowess is virtually unmatched, it's his rock heavy stuff that really gives you a sense of how great he is. This album is almost like listening to Steve Hackett's BAY OF KING'S which has some beautiful guitar work but starts to sound redundant due to the lack of variety."
4,Unbelieveable,"amanda marshall's new album is so much better than her first. her debut album was great, but ""Tuesday's Child"" is so much more mature. songs like ""Shades of grey"" are amazing, and ""ride"" is uplifting and fun...this album is great, and anyone who likes amanda's first albums hould definitely buy it"
2,Disappointing.,"When I saw a new release for amanda I got it immediately. Her first one was excellent. I loaned it to some friends, they bought it too. When I heard this one I expected more of the same good music. Was I surprised. Several songs were good but not enough to keep my interest. I couldn't wait for it to end. Depressing songs for the most part. Mine will be in a used record bin in no time. Save your money."
3,Getting Tired Already,"I was a huge fan of her early stuff and was thrilled to see a new release...well, it was more of the same.There was very little creativity and variety and with the exception of two or three tracks it doesn't bring anything fresh to the table.Very disappointing..."
4,Good for the lovelorn.,"Lyrically speaking, Amanda Marshall is not the best singer/songwriter I've ever heard, but her music is perfect if you're having trouble with your love life--alternately heartbroken and spunky.(Same goes for her debut CD.) Plus, she's got an amazing voice. I like to say this is sort of like Celine Dion as sung by Sheryl Crow, but it's more clever and less sappy than Celine. Don't expect this to completely knock you out, but it's certainly worth listening to."
3,2nd CD Blues,"After living with Amanda's first CD in my CD player non-stop, I am truly disappointed with this effort. Although there are some great songs on this disk, only Amanda's moving lyrics and terrific voice elevate this to 3 stars. There is nothing new here, the songs sound as though they were half hearted attempts to get top 40 air time. They fall short. I do look forward to her next release."
5,Amanda is a Gifted Artist,"They don't make them better than Amanda. Her voice is unique--although some might compare to Alanis or Cheryl Crow--but she actually has pipes. Why isn't a bigger presence in the States is beyond me. This album, like herself titled first one, is another masterpiece. While the first two tracks are my favorites, the entire album is easy to listen to over and over. Some songs make you fly; others get you down but not in a bad way. Her music can and will touch you. There is reason why many film makers use her music for their films here in America. Her third album is being released on Nov. 13 and yet I don't even see it here on Amazon. Something tells me that she has created another incredible album. The first single is very different for her--and quite good. Everyone has a story, indeed."
3,Good layout for the price,"This layout is the most basic I've seen. It does job at its low price, but it's not very high quality.It's mostly intended for dealer-managed games, not home games, since there is a specific seat for a ""Dealer"" on the Holdem side. We've actually drawn in two additional player spaces in that area since we don't have a designated dealer."
4,more info on book:,"Drawing on the classical theories of the Atonement, engaging in creative theological construction, the contributors present set of cogent, cohesive alternatives to either rejecting the doctrine of the atonement out of hand, or uncritically accepting it. Contributors include: J Denny Weaver, Bluffton University: ""Narrative Christus Victor: The Answer to Anselmian Atonement Violence""; Thomas Finger, Associated Mennonite Seminary: ""Christus Victor as Nonviolent Atonement""; Hans Boersma, Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia: ""Violence, the Cross, and Divine Intentionality: A Modified Reformed View""; and T Scott Daniels, Pasadena First Church of the Nazarene: ""Passing the Peace: Worship That Shapes Nonsubstitutionary Convictions""."
2,RIPOFF,I can't believe that Amazon has the gall to be associated with people who will sell $4.99 toy for triple the amount or more. These items are toys for kids. I am personally disgusted.
5,Stinkfly's number 1 on my list!,Stinkfly is so cool and he's my most favorite ehro in this show. Nice detail with the movable flapping wings and the legs. This is a really good figure and you should really add this one to your collection.
1,ugly & ineffective,Ugly. Very dim. Not visible after a few minutes. Save your money and don't buy this. Not much else to say.
5,Doug's Vampire Caper,"ONE SHOULD APPRECIATE A CHILD'S FILM FOR IT'S INTENTION, THIS FILM IS SWEET AND HOLDS A CHILD'S ATTENTION AND EXPLORES THEIR IMAGINATION. YOU NEED NOT BE A DOUG FAN TO BUY THIS FILM YOU NEED ONLY BE A FAN OF CHILDRENS CARTOONS. ""A REVEIWER"" (JUST A NORMAL PERSON HERE AT AMAZON) WAS FAR TOO HARSH WITH THEIR REVEIW. WANT A CLASSIC? BUY GONE WITH THE WIND. THIS FILM IS FOR CHILDREN AND THOSE AT HEART!"
1,DOUG STINKS AGAIN,LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER DOUG VIDEOS THIS ONE IS BAD TOO! IT DRAGS OUT AND IS BORING JUST LIKE ALL OF THEM!I HOPE ON FUTURE VIDEOS THEY MAKE IT ONE EPISODE SO DOUG DOESN'T HAVE TO BOR AMERICA FOR 44 MINUTES! PLEASE DONT WASTE YOU TIME AND MONEY ONE THIS BORING VIDEO!
2,Fly Motel,"It only caught one or two flies. And it didn't stick very well on the window, it kept falling down."
1,Not really,"Had 2 Black Flag Fly Motel Window Traps up for a few weeks...flies flew everywhere around traps, walked around the outside of them, walked over them, etc., did not catch a single (not one) fly. Put candy and sweets inside trap to attract flies to at least go near the glue....didnt work. The overall idea of the trap makes sense, but seems like it would need an actual fly attractant (not included) to get the flies to enter the trap and then get stuck to the glue--as it is now, you would have to just have plain old luck to have a fly blunder into the trap (no reason for a fly to enter trap as it is) and then blunder onto one of the glue pads (again, no reason for a fly to do that as is). Wish I could say it worked, it did not work at all for me."
1,Does not work,Does not work. I have four traps installed in different windows and after several days it has failed to trap even one fly. It needs an attractant to lure the flies into the trap which it does not have.
1,Worthless-,Dont waste your money. This product failed to trap even one fly. I'd rate zero stars if the option were available.
1,"Worthless, may as well throw dollar bills away","This is the most worthless product EVER!! We have a fly problem, could not even catch a bit of dirt in these ""motels,"" let alone a fly. The shipping costs we paid, plus having to pay return shipping, make it not worth returning these items. Don't waste your money- the motels are triangles of cardboard, like half a candy box, with sticky inside, no fly would go in there, let alone be caught."
4,"The finest film, even if it's not feature-length","This film (the first to be filmed in IMAX 3D) stars Val Kilmer,and Craig Sheffer as airplane pilots who boards a plane headed toFrance, and nearly got killed in the process. Nice performance byElizabeth McGovern as Sheffer's wife, who takes care of the housefixing meals and cleaning his clothes for him, while he fliesplanes. Entertaining, even if it's just a 40-minute feature film."
2,"Very high quality, heavy duty, and STIFF","This is a very high quality strap. It's tough, heavy duty, and it does the job. It's actually too tough for me--the creases in the strap from being folded for shipping never really went away, and it won't smooth out to match where I have it set. So it's a little awkward to use and I generally go with my flimsy but comfortable Ernie Ball straps instead."
2,A Bit Flimsy,"I was disappointed in this juicer once I received it. Though it's a nice design, the metal seemed overly thin. I bought a juicer of similar design at Williams-Sonoma for approx. the same price which is much more substantial."
4,Almost perfect!,"It looks good, and it is made very well, just two things I'd loved to see differently: a pointed tip for a better ""squeeze-start"", and maybe a little heavier gauge of steel, since it feels just a tad too light to me. Other than that, it works fine for oranges and lemons, limes may mostly be a tad to small for the size of cone it has!"
2,Not great...,"I used a similar juicer to this one at a friend's house and loved it. This one doesn't seem to have ""sharp"" enough (aka angular) ridges so it takes a LOT of pressure to get the lemon fully juiced. The rest of the design is fine (the drain holes and receptacle)."
4,Cool CD from one of the best new Acoustic Bands.,"Heard some music, saw some guys, and was blown away by the sound they produced with just two guitars. Live they are incredible. Bought the CD and love it. These guys rock! Intelligent and real, the songs and the instrumentation make this CD one of my favorite."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with that reviewer from Nashville. This book was quite disappointing. I thought i'd learn in detail how to create animation in Flash. DID NOT HAPPEN. I bought an animation book along with this one as a supplement sort of. Now I'm glad I bought the extra book, so I don't feel like my purchase and weeks of waiting were totally in vain."
4,more animation,A very good book - but next time I would like to see some more concise information to help me learn how to animate better instead of stories and stuff that isn't by the author. Some nice pictures though.
4,SOLID ALBUM,"this was a very good album. their style can best be described as ""Southern Hard Rock"" . the sound is in the style of alot of the 70's bands like bad co. or skynrd. with a later 80's kick to it. its too bad this style didnt really jive with the Hair slease LA sound of the day and it got basically ingnored by the masses. If you like The 4 horsemen or Black Crowes, this album is perfect for you."
4,Good Stuff,"I was fortunate enough to work the club these guys came out of, and got to see them play live. Bill Mattson's vocals are the highlight of this CD with some good to great songs to back him up. The CD is definitely on the bluesy rock side with songs like Mississippi and Fourwinds. To be honest these two songs alone are worth the price of the CD. Good stuff!"
4,NO GASKET INCLUDED,"Good quality item, However I expected a simple gasket so I could install quickly. Gave me a major hassle to get one latter. Make sure to buy separate gasket when you buy this."
5,College writing handbook,"I ordered this book after I made a 75 on an APA style paper due to wrong resources off of the internet. I was able to redo my paper and made a 95 on it becuase of this book giving me the right guidelines. I skimmed through the rest of the book and I am able to tell you that I will deffinitely use this book for the rest of my life to write a lot of different things. I highly recommend this book for anybody from middle school, high school, college and even beyond in the different fields of work."
2,Write for College: AStudent Handbook,"Ordered the book, recieved it and was very impressed with contents except several middle pages are bound in the book upside down. Company needs to fix that,would love to order a corrected edition."
2,Issues with delivery,"Apparently there was some issues with delivering the book that I did not and could not find out about until 20 days had passed (The length of time that it could take Media mail to be delivered.) My daughter was 2.5 weeks into the Quarter and ended up having to purchase the book at full price from the school bookstore. I am not sure that reimbursement alone was ample compensation for the inconvenience my Daughter had to go through. The seller is not completely at fault, the post office should share some of the blame."
3,The Frankenstein Syndrome...,"I saw ""The Frankenstein Syndrome"" for the first time today (2am 12/12/2011). The big ""what-if"" for me:""What if it is more than a man, able to utilize more of his brain than the rest of us""?Well, the few of us that have watched this movie found out!True, it was lacking in the area of special-effects, but that really didn't detract from the film (in my opinion).Honestly, I don't ever plan on buying it, but found it entertaining, nonetheless!I rate ""The Frankenstein Syndrome""...3 stars!"
5,How not to sell a million albums,"1) Write beautiful, intelligent grown-up lyrics2) Add kick ass music3) Boot your American producer for trying to make you dumb down your sound to sell a million recordsQuite simply, the best band on Earth enters the new millineum with an additional guitarist and a great new CD. Prime cuts are ""Beautiful Girl"", ""Get Up"", ""Weeds"" and ""Kick a Hole In the Sky"". Sadly, I don't think this CD comes with the surprise Tim Rogers solo CD, ""The Temperance Union"", but Dress Me Slowly is good enough on its own. Buy it!!"
2,Terrible experience with this product,"I realize you get what you pay for, and I didn't have high expectations for the security of a safe someone can literally pick up and walk away with, but I did not expect to have problems with the one thing it's supposed to do - LOCK and UNLOCK.The instructions that come with it are vague and inaccurate. For example, to program the code, you're supposed press a red button, release it, ""and you will hear 2 beeps"". You do not hear 2 beeps.But that's ok, because the code works ~~> SOMETIMES. I usually end up using my key, but if I wanted a key-only safe, I'd have purchased one.Twice I emailed the company, Lockstate, and did not get a reply. So I called them, spoke to a very nice man who said he'd have to research this and would call me back.I've yet to receive a call. Maybe their phone system is made by their engineers and he is working with broken equipment!Felicia"
1,poor build product,"I won't trust this safe, our key broken the first time using it. What if we put valuable inside then the key broken??I won't recommend this unit."
5,Good little safe!,"I ordered this safe for my son...It was used for him to store his money he earned in it, he thought it was neat! I recommend it for this purpose."
1,lighting,Disappointed that this order was not filled. Hated that we weren't able to finish decorating the front of our house for the holidays. Will have to switch to a whole new type of lights for next year.
4,"Farewell, Farewell under a different title","This came out (minus a few bonus tracks) in 1979 when they split up (for a few years). Dave Swarbrick had become the main man in the band and deafness was starting to affect him so it was time for him to throw in the towel with electric music and the band decided to follow suit. They played two concerts on their final day, at Knebworth (where I saw them) and at Cropredy (where I didn't). The album represented what they played on the final tour, with a few really old surprising chestnuts which they hadn't played in years thrown in. Better versions of 'Matty Groves' exist for the most part, but this version redeems itself when it turns into 'Orange Blossom Special'. The band are clearly not taking themselves very seriously on 'Bridge Over the River Ash' (there again, did they ever?) but otherwise it is a very listenable collection. There is great pathos inthe violin solo on 'Meet on the Ledge' which makes it a fitting farewell indeed."
5,The Ultimate Toltec Resource Book,"Sheri Rosenthal has a knack for distilling the essence of the toltec tradition into a delightful and practical guide. As a bonus, she brings the pages alive in true toltec form by expressing her authenticity through anecdote, wit and charm. This book is not only a masterpiece resource but a brilliant work of art as well. Thank you Sheri!"
5,The Ultimate Toltec book,"This book is like a condensed encyclopedia of Toltec. It doesn't just contain beautiful stories and examples, but it also provides a ""how to"" that can be applied. There is history, examples and exercises. So no matter what one's interest is, be it a history lesson or being moved by a story or really wanting to practice, it is all in this book.What is very cool is that it is written with a colloquial tone. So all in all it is really quite fun."
1,Not my favourite,"I bought this book because I absolutely love The Four AgreementsThe Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom, A Toltec Wisdom Bookand thought it would be a great and simple reference for Don Miguel Ruiz's teachings. This book is confusing, rambling and boring! I didn't get past the first couple of chapters....it just isn't worth buying."
5,Powerful!,"Thank you Dr. Rosenthal, I find your book to be concise and powerful. It is the definitive manual for those interested in Toltec studies. I am in gratitude for your prosaically precise ponderings!"
4,Gets to the point of Toltec Wisdom,"Sheri Rosenthal's Toltec Wisdom is one of the Idiot's Guide's and so by definition it is organized neatly by sections, passages and is highlighted so that anyone can learn and understand the important aspects of the Toltec's Wisdom (that is their spiritual philosophy). As I'm a student of different spiritual philosophies and was going to Peru, I decided to buy this book, then, duh, I realized I needed to read up on the Incas. Oh well, I read this book and then got another book on the Incas and did go to Peru. Wow! But's that's another story."
5,Immediate Relief!,"Immediate relief! That was my reward for reading this book and putting it into practice. It has my full recommendation for anyone suffering from the effects of allergies. This author is sympathtic and the book is easy to read. It is apparent that the doctor has scaled his vocabulary WAY DOWN to facilitate the reader's ability to concentrate on WHAT he is saying, rather than be dazzled by how brilliant he is. After battling allergies for 25 years, he has brought me new weapons. I thank the good doctor and am in his debt."
2,not the book for me,"I have multiple severe food allergies (eat something that touched a peanut and end up in the emergency room with a swollen face type deal). I came to this book looking for tips about good avoidance and some explanations about the actual chemistry of the reactions themselves. All I got were a few dismissive lines about how people with severe allergies just need to avoid the foods that make them sick. Thanks. If you have a more subtle problem, like eczema you can't seem to shake or migraines, this could be the book for you, but I didn't find it to be helpful."
2,Would make a good magazine article,"Though it does contain some interesting information, the book seems to be written for somebody with the IQ of a donut. He starts by detailing all his education, and then continues to talk down to the reader. He also repeats himself without adding any detail. (Yes, we learn that he really likes corn on the cob!) The contents of the book could easily be boiled down to 10 pages without missing anything important. Also, don't expect to find much of anything concerning 'classic' food allergies here.As a saving grace, there are a few nice charts and tables at the end to help pinpoint MSG content in fast foods and elsewhere."
2,Distinguish between food allergy and food intolerance.,"I have not read this book, but looking at the table of contents, the author does not make the basic scientific distinction between food allergy and food intolerance.While even unscientific medical practices might be helpful, I would prefer the many other books which are scientifically up to date."
1,Skip it!,"If you enjoyed the original Buckinghams with Dennis Tufano on lead vocals don't expect anything close to that with this conglomeration. The group sound has been converted into a Holiday Inn lounge act and the remake of ""Kind of A Drag"" is mediocre at best.I can't believe all the glowing reviews that have been posted here. Either I have no taste for 60s pop or the reviewers are all related to the group members."
2,"Fast shipping, but the game itself isn't good","It came fast, and everything was there. However the game itself isn't good. It's hard to beat, and when you die you have to start the level all over again. And you can't save the game in between. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,First xbox 360 game,"My wife and kids gave me a core Xbox 360 for Christmas along with this game. This game rocks. It's very pretty, and I love launching enemies through the air. I usually don't like straight ""hack and slash"" type games as my tastes tend more towards games like Civilization 4. However, this has become very addictive and stress reducing after a hard day at work and after the kids are in bed.The graphics are incredible. My very first game system was a Sega Genesis, and it's amazing how far games have come. N3 looks great on my 46"" Samsung DLP.It's been over two months, and I'm still working my way through this. I've opened up three characters with four to go. I imagined if I played a few hours every weekend, I'd already be done with the game, but since I only play an hour or two a week, this is giving me a long period of fun."
4,Good but repetitive,"Overall I liked this game. It has some cool moves. If you like button mashing, then this is ur game!"
2,N3 Review,"For the first few minutes, this game is great. It's basically just large scale battles. Which is fun, but it gets boring after a while. Also, I don't like how the saving works in the game. You can only save after a mission, and the missions take a while. So, if you die towards the end of a mission, you have to start it all over from the beginning.Pros:-Pretty good visuals-Easy gameplayCons:-Gets pretty boring, pretty quick-Saving sucks-Missions are longOverall, I give this game about 2.5/5."
2,It's ok,"I bought this in store at full price and I'm sad to say I wish I would of looked up reviews on it first and paid for a used copy. The graphics are lovely but for me personally it isn't my game. Plain and simple it's a button smashing game. The story is the same throughout the whole game but with different characters. And there's about 6-7 characters to boot. After the second or third time through I wanted to skip the cutscenes. As you pass through the characters, they get weaker. The last two are extreme pains and I ended up having to do some major leveling up to actually win them. As other people have mentioned, the saving SUCKS.If you want some easy gamer points, and over all a not to much time consuming game. I'd recomend it. Otherwise stay clear and looks for number two in hopes of it being a bit better."
3,Cheap Fun,"This game is alright, the graphics are probably the best feature. They aren't fully up to par with what can be done with the Xbox 360. This is just a game where your character has a sword and you go around and kill hordes of enemies. The gameplay is extremely repetitive but enjoyable in small doses."
4,Worth Every Penny!,"This game was really fun. Worth every penny I payed for it. Sadly i found that it was kinda short. It makes up for it with good replay value and beautifal graphics. One issue some may have is that it has the same game play style as Dynasty Warriors. Control one person and destroy an entire army while your guys don't do to much. The enemy tends to attack you far more often then anything else and that can be a bit frustrating. But I still loved the game and hope more purchase it. One note though, if you want a game with a twisting and hard to guess story line, just walk away now.Once you play it with one character, you can pretty much guess what will happen as you play the rest."
2,I guess I don't get it. I don't like this game at all.,"Like the review title says...To me this was a button masher with little to zero redeeming qualities in the actual game play. I would repeatedly get stuck fighting (read: hitting every random sequence of buttons possible, as fast as possible) in one spot for hours without being able to proceed regardless of what strategy I tried. Also, for you achievement fiends, you have to beat the game to get any achievement and the only achievements are for beating the game with each different character. talk about redundant and boring.The graphics were very good though which bumps it up a star for me. This reminded me visually of games on my PC in terms of quality."
2,Distributor cap,The name OEM seems to be purposely misleading the reader to think that it is an original equipment manufactured product. In fact it is not made by Hitachi or Bosch or Denso or any established brand as there is no brand label/marking whatsoever on it. So if you wish to purchase brand products then avoid this item. But its working OK so far at several months. Thats the only positive thing I can say at this point.
3,His honest reality at the time,"I met Burl once, after buying his book at a local store in Geigertown, PA. He was working as a stone mason in between drinking. He never denied his faults, but that day I gained a better sense of the world most people occupy in the area he grew up. This includes attitudes toward outsiders like me, which are legitimate in my own opinion!Mr Corbett is now in jail on a murder charge. From all accounts it was violent. If he manages to produce another novel I will probably buy it.In 2012 America, there is simply no such haven..."
1,waste of time,"worst book ever writen, just trash, the auther needs to learn how to write a book, its pure garbage dont waste your money"
4,They Ain't Making Jews Like Jesus (or Sam Spade) Anymore. Hit song by Kinky a while back,"If you like infantile, vulgar, cheap-shot, left-wing, sniggering, woman-objectifying, whitetrashculture, adolescent, near-the-edge-gay glomping, 60s radical leftover, scatological, cigar chomping, male-man humor from sexagenarian Texan, Jewish country singer (Did I leave anything out? Oh he worked for Willie Nelson running for governor, and tried it himself too), this book is for you. You get references to schoolboy celebs from the 50s: Big John and Sparky(radio), Captain Midnight(B&W TV); a quick reference to Ann Richards, masturbation, and the texture of cheap, grimy new York apartment living. In his unconscious stream of babble you get a pearl in a pile, every so often. And he solves the mystery after duly (for a detective) getting knocked out, shot and messed with by a femme fatale client. What a book!"
5,Relaxation in a bottle,Absolutely love this product. The smell is indeed very soothing and relaxing ... it even works to relax mom when giving baby her bath. I recommend this product without reservation.

4,Probably the Best of McG's Solo 70s Work,"This Lp lacks much Rickenbacker-12 work, unfortunately, but the compensation isthat the melodic duties are often passed to fine alto sax player Charles Lloyd. This record's production values areconsistent with a record like the Byrds' ""Ballad of Easy Rider""--it is dry and unpretentious. I rate this record as categoricallydifferent from McGuinn's later 1970s output, each example of which has the unfortunatequality of sounding like producers and engineers insisted on making McGuinn's records soundlike the soup-of-the-day sonically. In 1976, e.g., that was a sad thing--flabby drum sounds,utterly un-Byrd-like rock-radio guitar. This 1972 record is different. The genreis hard to name, because it alternates tracks with Lloyd's jazz licks with more folky tunes.But it is all pleasant, and does still manage to sound like a holiday from McGuinn's other workin this period."
3,Not bad,"Sound not as good as on the edsel label edition issued previously, I don't think. Although it appears to have been ""remastered"". Not quite up there with the Byrds albums but better than the the next few solo releases."
3,good,My brother got this for halloween. It probly last a year. It would of lasted longer but it did not last long but that was because after halloween he would wear it all the time. He loved that costume. That was because he adored army men.
5,Improvement over KDS-60A2000,"Was able to do a side by side comparison of the 55"" A2000 and A2020 in two different stores. Noticable improvement in both cases. Picture sharper, brighter and with better colors. On the strength of that comparison I ordered the 60A2020 60"" version. The Sony beat all the other sets in the stores on picture quality alone. Reliability should be improved since there is no color wheel. Time will tell on that score. The case is all black which is a big improvement. What were they thinking with the silver case on the A2000?"
5,Same as KDS-60A2000,"The only difference in this model and the A2000 is the color. They are otherwise exactly the same. This one is all black instead of silver/gray and black. The A2000 was 2006 model and this is the new 2007 model. The electronics, display technology, and software are all the same."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED BY THIS TV !,"This TV has great hi-def picture , but the audio lags the video ,so that it always looks like a badly dubbed foreign film . I have had two different Sony authorized repair people look at it , one took it to his shop for two weeks, only to report that it's supposed to be that way , and they can't fix it. I have seven friends and neighbors who have all agreed that they can see the problem clearly , but Sony will not admit that anything is wrong . I'll never buy another Sony TV , and neither should you. This might be a good purchase for a deaf family who only watch the subtitles and don't need the audio at all. Everyone else , beware of Sony rear projection technology. You'll regret it !"
1,sony will rip you off,"Attention! Sony will rip you off. Please join millions of us that got ripped off by this company. The optical block will go out with very little use. Sony does not stand behind their product. They will offer to buy you off and replace the TV with a lesser quality all so you will not follow up on a class action law suit! They will not fix the TV so don't bother with buying an extended warranty, just don't buy their TV's! Please heed this warning. Thousands of us have been ripped off and it is time we stood up to this big company and make them aware they have to be held responsible. There is a facebook page dedicated to Sony haters that have been ripped off by this company. Take a moment and read it if you don't believe this post. I wish I would have!"
5,"Some one pinch me this sony is two good to be true,,,,",When I saw this Sony Grand Wega in person I almost did a back flip.The color is the best I have seen at any price any size. The hdtv isLike your looking out your window. Would recomend to anyone who wantA big screen tv...... This one leaves the rest of them in the dust..
2,Not a good value,"I have bought a lot of over-priced import recordings over the years and only regret a handful of them. This is one that I regret.Reason: This is larded up with alternative versions of the same songs. And the CD's are both less than an hour long.Yes, most of the music here is good, but it is redundant and short-lived, leaving me with the sense that I've been taken.Even the consumers of the avant garde appreciate a fair deal and have awareness when they haven't received one."
2,"Decent, not the ""Perfect Prescription"" quality","While this album of b-sides, rarities, and excerpts from perfect prescription are o.k, there is still something missing on this album. ""That's Just Fine"" is left off, for no reason, as well some better renditions of their songs. Would recommend other releases well before this."
5,Pleased with my knife purchase,I love these knives so much that I bought two additional sets to give to my brother and sister for Christmas. The products arrived promptly and were in very good condition. You have to be very careful using these knives because they are so sharp. The sharpness does where down after several months of use. I purchased the reccommended knife sharpener (with the comb fingers) and it sharpens the knives brand new. Great product.
4,Rachael Ray Trio Knife Set,If I had Three knives to use around the kitchen this set would be my pick.
5,Great Set,Great set of high quality Knives. Razor Sharp and the handles are ergonomic. We have been using these for about a month and a half now and have been amazed at how they keep their edge. Great price.
4,At last. A CD with the classics on it!,"I've been looking for CDs of musicians that play the old songs. I am a preschool teacher and a mother and would like to continue these traditional songs on to another generation. This is good because its got a lot of songs I recognize. I still don't know where I learned half these songs, but memories cling to schoolrooms. ""Erie Canal,"" ""Hard Times Come Again No more,"" ""Old Folks at Home"" are a bunch of oldies but goodies. I was really looking for Stephen Fosters stuff that was ""tastefully"" done; this comes close. Its done in an accoustical way with the same guy singing EVERY song, that gets a little tiresome, even if it is his CD. But I am pleased with my purchase. There is no jazzed up versions here. I don't know about altered lyrics, either. But I do know its great to listen during my preschool day."
3,"too ""image"" oriented","I am a huge fan of the work of Miller Hull, however I was disappointed that this monograph lacked a thoughtful depiction of the design process. I would have loved to have seen the architect's sketches, drawings, and personal writing. There were really too many pictures, and the book had the quality of a film strip. The Ten Houses book, which showcases many of this firm's residential projects is a better book if you want to see drawings."
4,Miller/Hull Architects,I know Dave Miller personally and both those guys are great designers and wonderful people.
4,Great DVD Of A Little Known Gem,"Those of you wanting to upgrade your old VHS copies of Richard Lester's taut nautical thriller should now do so: MGM has given Juggernaut a sterling DVD transfer, in 1.66:1 widescreen, with good color balance and nary a blemish in sight (ah, the wonders of digital restoration). Hardly any edge enhancement either, as far as I can see. Way to go MGM!RIP David Hemmings (1941-2003)"
3,Juggernaut,"A entertaining but at times Mainly Boring British Predictable Disaster Genre flick riding the coattails of other movies of the same era,Sir Anthony Hopkins is good,Omar Sharif is good(even though he played the murderer Che in the movie of the same name.) If it was not so long and More Action it would have been better."
4,Terrific quasi-ambient music; cruddy packaging,"Why, why, oh why did this two-disc set have to come out in two individual jewel cases bound by a paper sleeve that you have completely and utterly destroy to get to the contents? That wouldn't be so bad if the sleeve in question didn't have information about the contents not found on the individual jewel-case graphics. Ah, well, no matter. Enclosed are two discs of great techno, ambient or whatever the heck you want to call it. Drum-machines and synths clicking along merrily in the background while, on top, Nelson's guitar leads scurl and bop all over the place. He claims he did it all for fun and that's what it sounds like. Real nice, but lose that outer sleeve!!"
4,The Singing's The Thing Here,"Production values, songwriting, accompaniment, and of course, guitar - all excellent. But his singing; wow! Much more passionate. Like he sat on a tack or something."
4,Richard Thompson - Gives sliced bread a run for its money...,"I'm listening to the first tracks now, and let me tell ya ... This man has more talent in his widdle pinky than Britney has in her entire surgically-enhanced body. If you have heard RT, then you know what I'm talkin about. If you haven't then for pity's sake get THIS ALBUM, a copy of ""Shoot Out The Lights"", and then get his Watching the Dark box set. Next go find a venue he is playing at (and he WILL play near you at some point) and GO. I have and will again. This man is a gift. Words fail me, but he hasn't yet. Praise the Lord and thank you for kind Richard and his great music. By the way the album is purty good."
4,Fifth Star Pending,"I'm assuming that my initial affection for these songs will intensify when I next see Richard onstage, hopefully soon. But for now I'll say it's another uncompromisingly professional Richard Thompson album with at least three classics: ""One Door Opens,"" ""Word Unspoken,"" and ""Outside the Inside."" The production is fitting for the material, and the musicianship beyond reproach. I like the understated addition of a female vocalist, who doesn't sound like Linda at all. Richard still crafts his songs like old world furniture painted in bold new colors. We're so lucky to have this guy."
3,Traipsing down the folkie path,"Moving along in no particular hurry, the 12 cuts on this CD are a less than successful return to Thompson's folk roots. Earnest, romantic lyrics dominate, centered on Thompson's emotionally charged vocals, surrounded by traditional instruments like the mandolin and dulcimer, creating a sound that is just a bit too laid back. All the songs seem to be coming from the same musical base and some (particularly ""First Breath"") move along so slowly that I find my attention wandering long before the end. There were no stand outs here, just a friendly folk fest; my expectations for Thompson's work are much too high to be satisfied by this one."
1,Serious bugs - No support,"I bought this game and have tried everything to get it to run.It constanly kicks me out of the game when it switches from opening sceen (Angie is watching the news) and when it switches over to FBI. I made sure I had the latest drivers for my video and audio. I have downloaded the latest patch from Whiptail Interactive, which does not support this product. They instead give you an Email address to the developers over in Europe. I am still waiting to hear back from them.I have more then the minimum requirements (3 GHz, 1 G RAM, ATI Radeon 9800 Pro)I have never had a game perform this badly and the lack of support is appalling."
1,Just TRY and play this game..,"Bugs, bugs, bugs... This game is loaded with them. The graphics are terrible - awful clipping problems. Every 10 minutes the game would crash, BOOM! No fun at all.Don't buy this waste of code.."
3,Liked the Game...Support NOT good !!,"The game had a different style to it...something different from other FPS games...BUT I probably will NOT buy another game from Nuclear Vision, because I emailed them..and never got a response from them."
1,"A very, very badly done budget FPS title","I love 1st person shooters, but this is easily the most amateurish, poorly executed game I have ever played. It has unbelievably bad graphics, laughably substandard character movements, awful voice acting, boring and unrealistic action sequences, dreadful sound, appallingly bad movie cut scenes, inferior weapon realism, totally unpolished game play, a buggy game engine, etc, etc. Gamers might have been quite amazed at Phychotoxic 12 years ago (I.E.: just *before* the original DOS Doom came out), but now the lack of even the most basic modern gaming software quality in this title implies that it was probably created by two or three mediocre programmers in their home basement (or perhaps the game's company ran out of money mid way through its creation?). Indeed, this is the only game in recent memory that I played for 20 minutes, and then threw immediately into the trash can."
2,EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG DID,"Let me give you 5 reasons why I am no longer a fan of James Patterson.-Jack and Jill-Cat and Mouse-Roses are Red-Violets are Blue-The Beach House.These novels followed the same tired formula. Short chapters and big text, intended to make the book seem much longer than it really is. Then there's the compulsory romance that exist in every single novel while the rest of it is an afterthought.1st to Die is about a Detective called Lindsay Boxer, who has annoying habit of crying, and often, in the most obsurd of situtions. I had nothing against it, but by the 20th time, it becomes extremely tedious, and you wonder how somebody that emotionally fragile can make it as a detective.Long story short, she gets the help of an ME, reporter, and DA, and together they bring down a nasty serial killer, who is neither intelligent, nor different from any of Patterson's other murderers.Also, was the killer get inspired by events that happened in Patterson's own life?"
2,"So many red herrings, Patterson has overfished thos ocean","You always know when the author is running out of ideas and the publisher still wants to cash in on the cachet: the author's name is bigger than and always above the title.I don't like writing book reviews. Too much like high school revisited, but you might want to save $8 or $9 on this one. Far-fetched. So full of procedural holes that it should have been listed under ""Fantasy."" And half-way through, I saw what was coming and where the red herrings were.I'll guarantee ... or at least give a limited warranty ... that the next step is for the publisher to change the book cover so that you don't remember having read this turkey.But what do I know? I thought ""Little Miss Sunshine"" was so boring AND absurd, I couldn't wait for Grandpa to die. It was ""Sideways"" in a VW bus., and ""Sideways"" was ""My Dinner With Andre"" with wheels. In other words, whether it's movies or books, I'd like to be able to stay awake."
2,Readers Beware - Publisher Error!,"After reading close to 350 pages of this mediocre outing by Patterson (check out Along Came A Spider or Kiss The Girls instead), I was amazed to find a truly incredible error on the part of the publisher - Chapters 93 through 103 are repeated and Chapters 104 through 112 are entirely omitted!The way to find out if you possess this error in the hardcover edition (I recommend this step before beginning the book) is to go to Page 346/Chapter 103 and see if it is followed by Page 315/Chapter 93. The next error happens on Page 379/Chapter 113 which is preceeded by Page 346/Chapter 103.Note to AMAZON: I'd highly recommend that you check out your copies for this error before sending them out to your customers. Happy Hunting!"
1,really bad book,"I am glad I didn't pay money to receive this book. I got it at the library's free table. I started to read it and found that it was full of violence. I stopped reading it and threw it away. Our society is violent enough w/o books having violence in them. So I threw it away and hurled it way back in the trash bin so nobody could reach it, it was just so bad. I would give no stars if I could."
2,Another AWFUL James Patterson ending!!!,The book was great. The ending TERRIBLE. This is becoming a pattern with his books!!!! AVOID
3,The women's murder club,"It's all about girl power. Lindsey Boxer with the help of an attorney, a reporter, and a medical examiner. That'a all they need to solve the Bride/Groom murder case. Everything changes when Linsey is diagnosed with aplastic anemia."
1,offensively idiotic,"The idea is OK, but the implementation is helpless, stupid, boring, naive, unbelievable."
2,About as shallow as they get,"When the typeface is about 13 points high and the chapters all of 3 pages long, on average, one should expect a fairly fluffy tome. And, not surprisingly, that's what one gets: superficiality cubed. I love to linger lovingly over my books, caressing every word. This, however, was a 3-hour wham, bam, no-thank-you-ma'am glide through. Hey, bring it with you to the smallest room in your house--and make *good* use of it, page-by-page!"
5,breath of fresh air,"Thank you James for getting of that Alex Cross thing, I was getting a little bored with him as a character.With that said, I could not put this book down. It was a page turner and kept my interest to the very last page. I hope that in each book he focuses on each of the four women's lives. I also loved that the chapters were short it made it easy to put it down when I had to.The novel is about four women who come together from different professions to catch a killer who is murdering couples on their wedding night. Each have their own expertise to bring in on the case, the cop, the lawyer, the medical examiner and the newpaper reporter. Just when they think they have their killer the plot twists and the clues point to someone else.As much as I like the alex cross series, I was so ready for a different venue."
3,One twist too many,"I enjoyed reading James Patterson's new novel until I got to the very end. The last chapter felt so completely rushed and thrown together for one more ""twist"", that I forget the book was already a good read. It really didn't need that last turn of events. This was a good, fast-paced thriller, introducing wonderful new characters. But when I read the last chapter, I had to look at the cover to make sure I wasn't reading a Patricia Cornwell novel. I'm sure others will love the ending, I've just seen it too many times before.Also, without giving too much away, Patterson seems to be getting rid of certain major/minor characters with ease, these days. While in ""Roses are Red"" I thought it worked well, in this case I thought it was a shame. This particular character would've added a great dimension to this new cast and series."
2,1st to Die,"Too much time spent with sex that did not contribute to the story. I'd don't personally know any women who sit around and discuss all the funny places that they have had sex. ( I believe this is a guy thing.) Mr. Patterson seems to have confused sex with love.When the forensic pathologist identified the culpret as a woman from the urine, she did not take into account that a woman who is menstrating would be wearing a pad or tampon. If a pad the urine would not have been on the floor, or not in that amount; if a tampon, there would not have been blood in the urine!"
2,James Patterson Trips UP,"I am a big Patterson fan, but this book was just not his best work. it is overly dramatic, trite and not respectful of the intelligence of the reader. The wierd feminist vibe is disingenuous and rings false. I am disappointed in this one."
2,seriously?,You have got to be kidding me? A woman dressed as a man is a convincing disguise? Even when speaking face to face with someone? What a rotten wrap up. Totally unsatisfying.
3,Women Detectives,This series is ok. It is not as good- in my opinion as the Tess Gerritson series. (Rizzoli and Isles). I will not comment on each numbered book.
5,I read this and now I need to read more,"I read this book and now I must read all the rest. Just understand that this book is first about the woman in it, then it is about the murder."
2,Don't like Patterson,"Dirty language. Convoluted plot. Thin character lines. I could go on, but I won't . Don't waste your time. Not for me."
3,Decent but not his best,"As a fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross series I was eager to read his new series which has four women as the strong ""heroes"" of the book. I was disappointed by the style of the book with its short chapters and rather choppy style. While I WILL read the second book and hope it is better written, in general I was disappointed with the quality of the writing and definitely do not think it is James Patterson's best effort. I would have even guessed, had I not known the author beforehand, that it was indeed written by someone else.The four main characters will assuredly be more defined in the coming book or books but we got enough of a sense of each one to truly be interested in them.I didn't figure out the end in advance and that is always a plus to me in any mystery that I read."
2,"A mediocre mystery, likeable but nothing special","I thought I'd love the novel based upon the cover reviews. I really enjoyed the newlywed murders theme, and the beginning. The strange illness was needless fill. But to my disappointment the twists at the end were rather predictable. Honestly I had the surprise figured out sixty-five percent of the way though the story. Nothing new here to surprise me. At 39 yrs. old I guess I just want more from my mysteries. I wish I could say something more or better, but I cannot say I really liked this book.The characterizations of the women were obviously from a male viewpoint, but hardly realistic. Women are not as different from men as a man would like to believe. I felt the female roles were sorely lacking in reality."
3,"Good ideas, mediocre execution","At least this novel doesn't suffer from the plentiful typos, 'English as a third language' grammar and cliché-ridden speech patterns of ""Four Blind Mice"". It does, however, have the same 3.5 page chapter structure, regardless of necessity; jarring shifts in viewpoint; a multitude of characters who use the same vocabulary and mouth off in the same manner, regardless of their age, sex, position or educational status.""1st to Die"" has an interesting story line, possesses a large degree of creativity, is fast-paced (perhaps too fast) and an easy read. However, the 'women's club' concept reeks of a ploy to sell more books to a new readership demographic and the main characters (and the secondary ones, too) are wooden and unidimensional.I imagine that James Patterson will eventually be credited with inspiring a record number of people to write novels, because never have the barriers been set so low."
2,one of his worst,"Hard-to-believe ending and weak character development. The second Lindsay Boxer book (2nd Chance) is slightly better, but still not more than two and a half stars. The Alex Cross series is much better."
3,"Quick and brainless. I mean, painless.","A nice little mystery. Kept me guessing, which is unusual. Not a fan of who happens to be the ""first to die"" as I really don't think stuff like that should happen, but overall, a good read. (And quick, considering how many pages it contains)"
3,Lindsay Boxer is no Alex Cross!,"And James Patterson obviously is not a woman. If you can get beyond those facts, this is a great Patterson-style mystery. Fast-moving, easy to read, involving. But unlike his Alex Cross mysteries, where you want to meet these people and become friends...I found the characters in this novel to be unbelievable. I was constantly made aware that the author did not have a handle on his protagonists.A homicide investigator deciding ""on a whim"" to befriend a reporter...and then trusting her immediately, and including her in a circle with her best friend...and opening up her investigation to them. No way! I just kept thinking, ""Oh yeah, like THAT would ever happen!""I read Patterson when I am rushed and just want a quick-read. I guess this fills the bill, but I hope he doesn't continue with the ""Women's Murder Club""...they are distractingly unreal."
3,Don't expect too much...,Nothing exciting...but it's a good book to kill some time...You won't get urge to finish this book at once...it took me about a week to finish this book...while reading something else...it's a book that you read in a bathroom or waiting for something.
4,"IT'S ALL HERE--SUSPENSE, INTRIQUE & INGENIOUS PLOT TWISTS","Although I did not particularly care for James Patterson's bestselling book, Along Came a Spider, I decided to give him another chance. I'm glad I did. I bought the CD audio version of 1st to Die. The plot was extremely engaging and suspenseful, & Patterson kept the reader guessing until the very end. I was very surprised over who the killer turned out to be--I did not expect it at all. The author was very clever over how he presented the foresenic evidence in each of the murder cases. I also enjoyed the way the 4 women decided to form their own private murder club in order to help solve the case. My only negative critique of the book: I thought the very last chapter was extraneous. Patterson would have done better to just let the book end in the next to the last chapter. That ending would have been perfect if he would've just stoppedt there."
2,Quick read - but not up to his standard,"If I bought this book off the paperback rack to read at the beach, I'd be pleased. It was a quick read with a surprise ending. However, Patterson's attempt to get inside the mind of a woman and her group of female friends left something to be desired. The mystery plot was intertwined with the quickly developing friendship of four women and it was a lame attempt at best. I had to often suspend my disbelief that people make lifetime friendships within the space of a week or two, or even after one meeting. Some men, i.e. Memoirs of a Geisha, can get write well in the female 1st person, Patterson needs more practice."
3,Simplicity is not always good.,"I eagerly reach for each new book by James Paterson, but MUCH prefer his Alex Cross character to these simple, predictable women. While the ""bad guy"" was awful the final chapter was too far fetched. I must confess I will not pass by any of Patterson's books but just enjoy Alex Cross more at this time. We'll see what the next book brings us.."
4,1st to Die,"I devoured this book within 24 hours. As always, the pace of James Patterson's writing was fast and gripping. Each woman from the ""club"" is unique and offers her own viewpoint and spin on each crime. I was so sure I had the end figured out..... However, there were a few surprises that left me thinking long after i shut the book closed!"
3,I'm the first to die on this one,"It is a decent book at best, but after forcing myself to read two of his other mediocre efforts I had to give up on this one. Once again Patterson needs to do a better job of editing his books. I am tired of sloppy stories that are full of plot holes and nonsense. He has definitely lost the great touch he had with Kiss the Girls."
3,A disappointment for Alex Cross fans,"Not a horrible book, but I kept hoping Alex would pop up in San Francisco and show these girls how to solve a murder! Patterson throws in his typical surprise ending."
1,Good beginning/Poor ending,"The beginning of the book was outstanding...I could hardly put it down. However the romance with Chris came across as so sappy (this is an example of a man trying to write from a woman's perspective and missing badly) and the whole trust thing with the four women protagonists was hard to believe. Also, the final third of the novel was very contrived. I'd pass on recommending it to anyone."
1,Nancy Drew lives again!,"I agree with one of the other reviewers that if you enjoyed Nancy Drew as a kid, you will enjoy this book. It is not well written and the characters are not well developed. I listened to the entire book (unabridged) on tape and I am sure I heard the narrator laughing in the background a few times on the lines she had to read. Bottom line: A simple book not well done but will probably make some TV of the week mini-series because of location in San Francisco and Napa that will show well on the tube."
3,Not his best work,"I was a little disappointed in this new endeavor by Mr. Patterson. Perhaps I expected too much after reading his other great novels. This was a good, light mystery, very predictable but I really wish I had not bought it at full price...I should have waited on a used paperback copy. The idea of a Mystery Club made up of professional women just doesn't ring true. Many times I've read books by men trying to ""know"" what women think and how they react (and the oposite is true of women authors trying to write about men) but it always seems to fall flat somehow. I hope Mr. Patterson hasn't gone the way of John Grisham and is just writing to ""get the next one out there"""
3,King of the Airplane Novelists,"Patterson is an amazing writer, you always know more or less exactly what you're going to get and you always know more or less the level of quality that you can expect. It isn't great, it isn't awful, and you usually derive enough entertainment out of it to get you through one reasonable length flight.1st to die introduces the Women's Murder Club-- four women who band together to try to find a vicious killer of newlyweds. Many nasty explicit deaths, a plethora of tough plucky females, and the obligatory twisted ending. Don't begin boarding without it."
3,Too many twists.,"I've read a few James Patterson novels, and I find this one to be the worst. 1st to Die starts out with a lot of promise and suspense, but takes a downward spiral turn once we think the detective has the killer in her clutches.The biggest problem is the twists. There are simply too many. It causes the plot to become confusing as well as unbelievable. There are simply some things that don't add up if we're to believe Patterson's ending. Some reviewers have already alluded to these problems, so I feel no need to reiterate, but like someone said, the plot holes are big enough to drive a tractor trailer through. And all because Patterson needed to get one last gasp out of the reader."
4,Top Notch Thriller,"I was a bit hesitant to pickup this audio cd because the ""women's murder club"" thing kinda turned me off. However, I am so glad that I chose to listen to it. Wow! What a thrill ride, right from the beginning to the end. James Patterson is an amazing writer but his Alex Cross series became a bit flaky at times but this new series is a winner!!"
4,keep the women's club alive,what a surprise to find a nice grisly murder/serial killer being hunted by 4 women! with the introduction of this women's club - i think mr. patterson's got a hit here. i recommend this book!
5,addicting,wow! i couldnt stop reading it. really i couldnt! amazing plot sad ending but a great book for anyone who likes mysteries or watches csi:D
1,cheesey and gruesome,"The first two-thirds of this book were good and exciting. The murder scenes were a little gruesome for me, but I can get over that. What ruined the book for me was the incredibly cheesey last third or so of the book. It's like all of a sudden all you need to do is think to yourself is ""what is the most cheesey over-dramatic thing that could happen?"" and that's what happens. It's like two books squeezed into one, most of the murder-mystery part is at the beginning."
5,One more great novel by James Patterson,"As usual James Patterson has come up with another masterpiece. I read 7th Heaven and got hooked, so now I am starting with number one of the Women's Murder Club series. This covers the formation of the club and what led up to it. It's a spellbinding thriller with a great twist at the end. A definite must read!"
4,Actually liked this one,"I was so doubtful that I would like this book that I waited and got it as a used paperback. Now I want the rest in the series. I was skeptical because of the tired, overdone ""womens' club"" type books that seem to flood the market, but these gals do pull it off! While they are kinda cliched, Patterson manages to breath life into the different characters and make them seem plausible. The dective-with-a-terminal-disease actually seems very real and human, as does the tought-as-nails lawyer, snoopy news reporter, and warm, loving physician. Each contributes a piece to the book that makes it readable and enjoyable. The murder scenes are graphic and the ending somewhat predictable, but I stayed up all night to finish it! I will get the rest."
5,"Great book, going to love the series","I am new to reading the Women's Murder Club series, and I am off to a great start!!! I recommend this to all who already love James Patterson!!"
4,No frills,"This was my first Patterson book. I just finished it and am now reading the reviews. I find much to agree with in the 5-star as well as the 1-star reviews. I enjoyed the read, even though I found the literary style flat and devoid of most saving graces. But I kept thinking as I went along that this is probably what people (except me) want and expect nowadays in writing, isn't it? ""No frills""? ""What you sees is what you gets"".... ? Good? Bad? I don't know. It was kind of fun to read, though."
4,Better and better,"James Patterson keeps getting better and better. His new series of characters are women who are tough, intelligent and not afraid to get their feet wet. Fast action and a surprising climax. You'll love it."
4,Pretty darn good,"This is the first James Patterson novel I've read, so I can't compare it with his Alex Cross series. However, I liked the book enough to stay up until 2am reading it. The characters, especially the lead character, Lindsay Boxer, was fun to watch in action. I also enjoyed getting the perspective of the killer. The short chapters keep you turning the pages, so does the story. I can't say that I was all that surprised by the ending. But I will rank this an over all satisfying quick read."
4,loved it!,I just finished this book. I could not put it down. I can't wait for the new James Patterson novel. I didn't want it to end. I highly recommend this and all James Patterson novels.
3,3 1/2 stars,"I certainly didnt think that this was Pattersons best book, but it wasnt a total bust. It was definitely a fast paced read, as I finished it in one siting. However, although I normally like his style of very short chapters, for some reason I didnt feel that it worked well here. It really seemed to break up the flow of the novel. If you have read Patterson before you know he always goes for a suprise ending, which doesnt work here, because if you think about it you can figure out what will happen long before the end. Basically, it is a relatively entertaining novel, but it doesnt break any new ground. I would call it ""Patterson-lite"". I think Pattersons biggest problem is that he is putting books out too fast these days. This is what, his third book in the last six months? Maybe now that he is so popular he feels that he doesnt have too try as hard, and he is going for quantity over quality. Check it out from the library instead of buying it."
1,1st To Die,"Everything I have read by James Patterson has great plots but horrible dialogue. Mr. Patterson seems only to be able to write in very short sentences with excessive use of ""!"" (exclamation mark) after every 2nd & 3rd sentence. He has brillant and exceptional plots. Very exciting. I just am no longer willing to put up with the inability to write complex sentences. Thank you"
1,Another waste of good paper by the master huckster,"I can overlook Patterson's full-color photo inside backcover and self-wrote byline ""America's #1 Thriller Writer"" in the paper back (after all he used to write ad copy for breakfast cereal) but I can't abide the ego behind this poor excuse for a thriller. Patterson seems to have no respect for even the average reader and his pandering to what he hopes is a new audience with his version of a Sue Grafton novel is unfortunate."
2,Not 1st Rate,"Definitely not one of Patterson's best and not a good way to start off a new series. I agree with many others that the characters are not well developed. Also Patterson continues as he does with Alex; ""angsting"" the life of his main protagonist in this case, Lindsay Boxer. I guess he just doesn't want his main characters to enjoy any personal happiness. Interesting. Also pretty unbelievable that someone that ill could work the hours that Boxer does. Aside from that, I felt the story was weak and I agree with another reviewer that the ending left you wondering who was the character in Chapter 17. So many chapters, maybe this one was suppose to be edited out and it wasn't. Makes no sense. I think Mr. Patterson needs to slow down and return to his original crafy, page turning ways and not become a novel mill."
4,A chick thriller,"First to Die is the beginning of what I hope will be another great series of novels. The novel starts slow, then picks up quickly. I call this a ""chick thriller"" is because it brings together four women who solve a very bizarre series of murders. I applaud Patterson's way of developing these characters as it seemed a bit far fetched at first, but turned into a very well developed series of characters. The only thing that concerns me is that Patterson is going to start mass producing novels just for the sake of putting them out."
4,Finally a real ending!,"A serial killer, a cop with a theory that no one believes, pretty standard fare until it is handled by Patterson. I love Patterson. His writing is interesting, his stories are thrilling, but for the past few books, he has lacked an ending....I was getting tired of the bad guy always slipping away only to reappear in another book - I want my mysteries solved, and justice done! OK - that said, this newest book is great. I like the new cast of characters. It's a good group of women, without being a 'cute' group of women. I am looking forward to more adventures with these ladies!"
1,Shallow and poorly researched,"I love murder mysteries. If you do too, skip this one. The plot was painfully predictable. The supposed fatal illness ""Nigli's apastic anemia"" that the main character has does not exist. I'm an RN and have worked with bone marrow transplant patients for 23 years. To have the chief detective of a serial murder investigation be newly diagnosed with a fatal hematologic illness, not tell her superiors and continue in her position is preposterous and would be unethical in the real world. That this condition is ""treated"" (and evenually ""cured""!) with blood transfusions is ridiculous.I had similar reactions to the woman's group. No depth, unrealistic."
1,"1st to say ""huh""?","I found ""1st to die"" very unconvincing -- a shoddy product from a really good writer. The murders are committed by a psychopath, but the murderer turns out to be a person who's stable on the outside. This is a cheat. A true psychopath cannot function in society, at least in the mainstream. Cannot. Cannot. You may as well have the murders committed by a space alien. It makes as much sense. Within the 'universe' an author creates, you must be consistent -- you cannot inject a new element or change the character's makeup to drive a plot. In a realistic mystery, things have to make sense and match real world facts. They do not in this book. And the final ""plot twist"" has a HUGE plot hole that made me say ""huh?"" at the end and made me toss the book into the corner. And by the way, revolvers do NOT have safeties! Jeez Louise, if you write about weapons, learn them first."
4,Parted by Serial Killer,"The Women's Murder Club is born in this captivating novel about a serial killer who has targeted brides and grooms. What a horrible way to start a marriage. ""Til death do us part"" comes too quickly. Detective Lindsay Boxer has a lot going on in her personal life and needs to rely on close bonds to help her solve the case professionally. She finds help and support from her best friend and two new unlikely allies whose commonality is surviving and thriving in a man-driven world. The story intensifies as the Murder Club closes in on the clues. You will enjoy the shocking twist at the end.Review by Dilsa Saunders Bailey, author ofDreams Thrown Away,a romantic suspense novel filled with sex, lies, and murder."
5,I am addicted to this series!,Very easy reading. I am addicted to this series... have read 1 through 5. The 6th one is one the way and should arrive on my doorstep anyday... I can't wait!
4,couldn't put it down,Its been a while since I had a good book to read..Very captivating and so many twists! Good read! Cant wait to read #2...
3,Patterson not at his best,"First to Die is a great read for an airplane or when in the mood for something very light. The prose is very direct, probably on an early high school reading level. The mystery is not very hard to figure out and most readers familiar with the genre will get it long before the ending. I would not rate this as highly as Kiss the Girls or most of the Alex Cross novels. Still, you can do worse than read First to Die to kill a few hours."
5,Well Written Mystery,"This was a very good book. Typical Patterson...short chapters, interesting charactors, weaving plot, and just an easy book to read. This is the kind of book that I thought about while at work where I couldn't wait to get home and read more. Look forward to more in this series."
3,A Cross Between James Patterson and Linda Howard,"A little too Harlequinesque for my tastes. I didn't need all the ""As The World Turns"" details (one can almost hear schmaltzy organ music in the background) of the lives of the Women of the Murder Club - but the story of the serial killings they are trying to solve is very good."
2,Dear James:,"I do for the most part like your books. I have read every one and like the best the Cross books. Your last book was ok but I would like to point out on page 257, I have never heard of a renfield 30-30. The only companies who made a 30-30 are Winchester and Marlin. What is a Remington 40.5? There is no gun of that caliber, and it's not even a caliber. Also there is no such gun as a {Glock Special 1990 issue.} There is a Glock 17, 19 and so on. Farther on in the book you write that Lindsay takes the safety off of her revolver, Revolvers don't have safeties.All in all you books are good but you need to do a little research on firearms, 10 minutes on the Internet and you could have everything you ever wanted to know about the subject. There are a lot of people who would read your books if you could get the firearm aspect right."
1,SOPHOMORIC WRITING - MICHAEL CONNELLY TEMPLATE,"KUDOS TO JAMES PATTERSON AND HIS PROMOTERS.TO ADVANCE THE SALE OF SUCH A POORLY WRITTEN BOOK TO THE STATUS OF #1 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER MUST HAVE REQUIRED GREAT MARKETING SKILL.EITHER THE TIMES HAS A VESTED INTEREST, OR PATTERSON HAS MASTERED THE ART OF WRITING FOR LOWEST OF THE MASSES."
3,An entertaining read but not the best written.,"James Patterson seems to have a good grasp on plot and writes a novel which reads easily and quickly. If, however, you prefer something a little more memorable, pass this one up...you aren't missing much.While the novel is entertaining and the plot is fair the characters themselves are shallow and not very likable. I found it impossible to relate...each character is a masterpiece in stereotyping. Furthermore, Mr. Patterson is quite inept at writing in the first person as a female.If Mr. Patterson spent just a little more time on character development to support his good ideas and fairish plots his books would probably capture a greater following of fans. As it stand I am not likely to pursue any of his work any time soon."
4,Still Good the Second Time Around,"I am rereading this entire series again because I enjoyed them so immensely the first time. 1st To Die did not lose any of its luster the second time around. Tho Patterson is not as detailed and educational as Patricia Cornwell, his women's murder club is entertaining and engrossing and I love the fact that the good guys (gals, actually) do not always have a happy ever after ending. This particular novel is the very beginning of the women's murder club and introduces the reader to Lindsay, a homicide detective, Cindy, crime reporter, Claire, medical examiner and Jill, a lawyer. The reader gets an excellent look at all four occupations. 1st To Die focuses more on Lindsay Boxer and the other three are gradually introduced. The case: a serial killer that chooses newlywed couples. Quite a shocking twist in the end too."
5,This book is unforgettable,"so many books are forgotten days after you read them. Not most Patterson books, and not this one. This is one of Patterson's best! This book will stay with you in your memory for a very long time. Great page turner. Great story"
4,reread,"First To Die is a book about a detecive after a killer who kills newlyweds. Along the way she becomes close with three women and they form a club to try to solve the murders ""outside"" the system. A great first book for the series."
3,Good Mystery,"Good read. Patterson writes a page-turner. His characters can come across a little hard, a little rough; the storyline can get a little squeamish, but the end result is a good mystery."
3,Too Far-Fetched!!!,"I really thought this book was kinda silly. The entire time I was reading it I was shaking my head in disbelief. The characters are not as likable as the ones in the Alex Cross series. My favortie book of James Patterson's is by far ""Along Came a Spider"". It was much more believable."
3,"Lipstick,high heels and murder!","James Patterson has written a clever and fast paced story. A 'Women's Murder Club' certainly is nothing I've ever read before and the idea is fascinating. There is lots of blood, guts and femininity in '1st To Die' and the idea is so clever I only wish he were a better writer. That said, it is a fun, easy read. A perfect beach or airplane book ."
1,This book stinks,"I've been following Patterson for 10 years. His first book got my attention. This guy hasn't got better, in fact; he got worse. Never again will I spend money for this clown. He reminds me of Stephen King. That means I will never buy any one of their books ever again. Adios.John Etienne"
1,YOU'RE KIDDING--RIGHT??,I DDD III DDD FINISH THIS BOOK-------BUT-------THE FIRST 100 PAGES---THIS IS PRETTY STUPID.THE NEXT 100 PAGES---THIS IS REAL STUPID.SHE GETS SICK---STARTS SCREWING LIKE A RABBIT----THIS IS VARY STOOPYD.ANOTHER 100 PAGES---SHE'S CURED AND THE STUPIDITY ENDS--THANK GOD!!!
3,1st to Die by James Patterson,"My first experience buying a used book and it had obvious wear, corners turned down and someone wrote their name on the first page. I expected a cleaner book."
1,BAD BOOK,"I had wanted to read James Patterson and this book looked like an ideal opurtunity to be introduced to a new great author. I was suprised .I was on the plane trapped with this book. I have never read such a copied mystery. Please do not try to copy Cornwell on the medical examiner, and please James do not use the words looky-loo in your next books because with things like that in your books you can barely put together a complex sentance. It started out with the murder on the 13th floor htan it was on the 30th. You ened a new editor."
1,Very Disappointing,"Fist to Die was a big disappointment compared to Kiss the Girls. I thought the dialogue was poor and a bit cheesy (for lack of better word). It got to the point where I didn't care who the killer was. There were just a lot of stupid elements in it that I don't want to mention because some people haven't read it. My opinion, don't bother."
3,An OK Read; Not The Best Patterson,"The plot of 1st to Die is interesting enough to keep reading. A serial killer is murdering young newlywed couples. His goal is doing the worst thing that anyone has ever done, and he seems to be leaving a clue behind at each murder scene for the investigators to find.The investigators are the problem with the book. Four professional women join together to form the ""Women's Murder Club"" which sounds more like a sorority outing than the serious focus that the crimes require. The four are into ""sharing"" and being there for each other. The dialogue is girlie stuff and not nearly as strong as Patterson usually is with his Alex Cross stories. A good surprise ending makes finishing the book worthwile. I will read Roses are Red, the new Alex Cross book, and skip the next book with the girls."
3,My head was spinning!,"I thought the book was good. It kept my interest and it had me guessing. It had your attention from the first chapter. After I finished the book I began to let it sink in and he contradicted himself on some of the facts as to the sex of the killer, and if the victims knew the murderer. The book was good but confusing."
3,First non-Cross Novel,"This was my first non Alex Cross novel by Patterson. A devoted afficionado of Detective Cross, I was disappointed in that I failed to appreciate any depth to the characters. Unlike Cross, I didn't develop an empathy for Detective Boxer. I probably just got used to Cross and expected more. It was a pleasant if not totally unpredictable read. I felt the ending had one too many force twists for my tastes."
2,1st to die,"James Patterson should remember he is a man, and write as a man. His attempt at being a woman detective was so inept that all throughout the book I just wanted to scream- Women do not act/react that way! The very idea that 4 professional women could drop everything that they were doing to meet up with each other (in 10 minutes no less!) that all four of these women decided to put thier jobs on the line by being in the ""Women's Murder Club"" is a JOKE! The lead character Lindsay, has a deadly disease, but continues to miss blood transfusions, work long shifts, drink numerous margarita's and still she can work like nothing is affecting her. PLEASE! A woman would take care of business first- her health. There is no way she could have physically maintained the lifestyle Mr. Patterson suggests she did. The book was predictable, boring at times, and truly disappointing. I enjoyed his other works, but please Mr. Patterson, stay in gender."
2,1st To Die,"I was disappointed in this book in that I thought the plot regarding the murders could have been more developed, as well as the relationship between the members of the Murder Club. As a female I thought that the foursome lacked the connection most women have when they develop friendships. I did however, think the author did a splendid job with the love interest for the main character, as well as his distinctive title."
4,Have to keep on reading,Once you read the first one you have to read the next one and so one. You can stop. I hsve already read seven books. I plan to read the next one.
3,1st to Die (Women's Murder Club),I guess I expected something different. I haven't read anything from this author before. This was pretty gruesome but Some of the twists were good.
3,Good reading,I like the characters sure to like them in next book. Thought the killer should have been someone else until the epilogue made sense of it.
2,1st to die,"I think the book is poorly written. It seems silly to me. The strong women in the story, each with a pretty high level job, just get so wimpy. I'm only about 1/2 of the way through, so I will finish it. But it doesn't compel me like a good Patricia Cornwell book."
4,Good Read,"I started this series on the sixth book, so when I saw this at an airport, I was excited about finding out how the WMC had started. I really enjoyed reading about it unfolding. The mystery of the plot kept me intrigued. It did get a little more graphic than I would have liked at times, and I almost lowered it to 3 stars as a result."
4,Noone is safe,"Read this novel after reading the 4th and 5th in the Women's Murder club series. Not as polished as those two but a very good base from which to start.Good read, kept me involved, and after this one I finished the series. Enough said!"
1,More than disappointing,"I've read a lot of Patterson's books and, although I don't find him to be the best of mystery writers, his plots are usually engrossing. Actually this one has a ""good"" murder story, but the rest of it was extremely disappointing. I never found a good reason for these women to spend time with one another. I thought a really good detective could do the same thing, only better. Additionally, I saw no purpose bringing a life-threatening disease to the story (and then a miraculous recovery); it was an impediment. Thus, I'm off of Patterson for a good while, and I won't ever waste time reading another ""women's murder club"" mystery."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"The plot twists are ridiculous and cheap. Flat and unbelievable characters. The females are portrayed as embarrassing stereotypes; over-emotional - a lot weeping and bonding. Apart from having a juvenile's concept of women in general, apparently James Patterson also lacks a basic understanding of the science of forensics or police methodology. Not good for a crime novelist."
4,James Patterson is amazing!,"James Patterson must be not only the most prolific writer of popular fiction today but the most versatile, as well. For any writer to produce novels in such a variety of genres is unusual, but to do it well is extremely rare. This is the beginning of an exciting series in the crime/thriller genre, and it had me turning pages right up to the end. I'm looking forward to more in this series."
3,it started good but ended really badly,"James Patterson's take on women detectives started out OK, with a nice structure, revealing the killer on the 1st chapter, so you feel you're reading a whydunit. Things are made more interesting by the appearance of a very likely suspect. However, logic and plausability were thrown out the window by the time the resolution came in. It's as if Patterson was thinking ""what more incredulous coincidences can I come up with?"". Also, do we really need that epilogue? Isn't better just to leave things hanging quite a bit so as the reader can have something to think about? But no, Patterson (or his editor) chose to dumb down an otherwise OK book with that unnecessary epilogue."
3,1st to die,"Not really up to the standard that Patterson set with the Dr. Cross series. It's like he combined women detective novels with women M.E. novels and then added a ""pinch"" of women crime writer novels and ""stired"" in a little women lawyer (DA) novels for good measure. The finish has lots of twist and turns but we expect that from Patterson."
5,3 1/2 hours later...,... I closed the cover and started wanting more! A real page-turner with characters I can relate to and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing to the last page. Patterson has outdone himself this time. Is the next one done yet???
2,Disappointing,"3 stars is kind, 2 might be too cynical. This is a quick, semi-interesting read - a little too simplistic and implausible. Some twists and turns don't make much sense, and the ending was definitely disappointing(too quick and again didn't make much sense). This book is definitely not up some of his previous books, nor does it stand with any of the other great mystery writers."
1,Not a promising start to a new series,"The premise to this book sounded interesting but Patterson does not write well enough to convince you about the villain, the heros or the plot. Ultimately unsatisfying."
5,1st to Die,"This novel has me hooked on James Patterson and his style of mystery writing. Each time I thought I had figured out ""who dunnit"" the course of the novel changed. Kept me on the edge of my seat to the end. Excellent reading."
3,1st to die,"James Patterson would do well to stick to his Cross characters.this was a story about women, written by a man and it was obvious that it was a man....I was very disapointed. I gave it a 3 stars only because it was well written as usual, and the pace was quick and slick.still, I was disapointed."
2,Loyal Alex Cross fan,I have read all of the Alex Cross's series and loved each and every one. So I thought that I would give the Women's Murder Club a try. Big mistake. I was not impressed with this book. The story was long and dragged out. It was like a boring movie of the week type of deal. The ending was suprising though. That was the one good thing about it. I hope he sticks to more Alex.
2,Patterson should read up on dogs...,"I agree with what a lot of the 1 and 2 start reviewers have said and have one thing to add: the author has obviously not done any research on dogs. Or, possibly, border collies in America are very different from the breed we have here in Scotland. Border collies are fairly large dogs and I would really like to see one perch on somebody's lap looking out to the bay... makes for a very, very funny picture! Next, does Mr Patterson know that border collies are working dogs and keeping one in a flat is absolutely ridiculous and amounts to animal cruelty? And if the heroine of the books indeed keeps her collie in a flat, then it is highly likely that when she returns from work, the collie will have taken the flat apart from sheer boredom."
4,Another Great One,"I just got done reading this...and realize I have 8 more to go for the series! I didn't think I would like it since Alex Cross was not in it, but this is definitely a great beginning to from what I hear, a great run of Women's Club books.I can't wait to read the others. Awesome book- defintely suggest it!"
4,"Good book, could have had a little more character development.","I enjoyed the book, but felt that the character development could have been better. It took too long to really feel like you knew the characters very well."
3,Not up to the quality of his Alex Cross books,"I read this novel based on the strong recommendation of a fellow suspense lover. While I did find it entertaining, the ending had one plot twist too many and I found the Women's Murder Club plot device to be forced, at best.Yes, I realize that these four women are the basis for a number of other books to follow and the character development will follow but, to me, it seemed like the pilot episode of a TV show - you get to meet all of the characters, they do something cool so you'll continue to watch and the character development will follow.Based on this first novel, I doubt that I'll continue on with the series - there are too many other books in the library to read!"
1,This is the WORST book I ever read!,"I cannot believe they released this terrible piece of garbage. The only reason I finished it (unabridged audiobook) was because I was on the road in the middle of nowhere. I should have listened to static. Everytime I thought this book couldn't get any worse, I was dead wrong. The book is poorly written, the plot is transparent, the characters are a joke, and the dialogue is so ridiculous that I'm lead to think this book was written by a gifted 8 year-old. What were they thinking? I'm actually very angry about this. I listen to DOZENS of books on tape each year, and this is the first time I've written any kind of review. Patterson has no respect for himself or his readers, or he wouldn't have released this piece of utter GARBAGE."
1,First novel or deadline+lousy editor?,"This book is a fine example of what happens to authors to 'make it' as recognized names. First, they can publish their first attempts, which were too lousy to publish then and still are.Second, their editors push them to put out more books, and quality goes to hell.This is a simply terrible book: the writing is poor, the characters weak and the plot is so think as to be laughable.This could not be published by anyone except a well-known author. The fact that it was says a lot about the modern publishing industry."
5,Can These Women Solve the Murder Mystery?,"In San Francisco, newlyweds are being stalked and then slaughtered. Four unforgettable women all in law enforcement, will enter the picture here, and try to solve these heinous crimes.In the story, you'll meet Lindsay Boxer, an inspector in the city's police department. There is Claire, who is a diligent medical examiner and tries to put the pieces of the horrible evidence together. Jill is an assistant D.A. also trying to solve this puzzle, and then Cindy who is a reporter who has just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle.The four women will all put their talents, courage and brains together to find and trap one of the most diabolical killers of all.And they want to solve the crimes as quickly as possible before this killer commits more heinous crimes.I completely enjoyed this book and found it an exciting read!"
5,WOW,"This book was unbelivable!! There were so many twists and turns that I couldn't believe what I was reading! This book isn't one of those books that follow the pattern of most suspense/mystery books. The end is what shocked me the most. I hated the ending because it is not what I wanted, but it was all for the better. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to try something sinfully good."
5,great group of women working together,I love the idea of women in typically male fields working together to solve a crime. I usually listen to mysteries in the car from San Francisco to LA and this one definately made the ride FLY by. The SF setting was great and overall the plot was well developed. Enjoy (and then check out 2nd Chances)!
5,awesome!!!,I am not a hard core reader and usually find it easy to read a few chapters and put a book down for a couple of hours or days. Not with this one! This book went from very interesting to very intense. I had not read James Patterson before so I didn't now what to expect. Trying to find a good place to stop reading was almost impossible. Very entertaining.
2,Rarely Have I Been This Angry at an Author,"I wonder if the same person wrote this book the whole way through...I don't think so since the author gave us a scene with the arch-villian at the beginning, and then when he reveals the true murderer at the end, you find that he outright lied to you because there was no way the scenes with the killer in the beginning could possibly have happened (did you forget you wrote those?). Add to this, the gratuitous killing of the lead male character (gratuitous in that it served no purpose and the guy did not even die in a bizarre plot twist) and you realize he was killed off because the author did not want to have to change the direction he had originally intended for the novel. Overall, a book that caused me to be mad at the author when I finished, sadly since the initial character development was so promising."
1,"I liked this book, however on thing ruined it for me","I found this book enjoyable enough. It was quick paced and mostly kept me guessing. However, one ""clue"" was so ludicrous that the entire book was ruined. Without giving anything away, I would just like to tell Mr. Patterson that ""boys"" can most definitely ""get them""."
5,The Great Patterson,James Patterson is one of my favorite authors of all time. I have never been able to guess the ending of any of his novels!!
2,"Retelling of movie ""Basic Instinct""","This super-cumbersome plot is, like most cheap devices, designed to fool you and then come back at you with a ""surprise"" ending. There was not surprise for me, only the endurance test of reading through these one-dimensional, over-written characters as they stumble toward a conclusion. Nothing was particularly compelling and while it read easily, the total lack of challenge made it very boring."
3,Average,"This is a fun book to read. It is well written, and keeps you interested for most of the story. The only problem that i found was that the last chapters were kind of predictable. Other than that, the book was ok."
3,Disappointing,"I was rather hesitant to start this book, after the disappointment of The Jester. Four women (a homicide detective, a medical examiner, a reporter, and an assistant district attorney) form the Women's Murder club to pool resources to try to stop a serial killer who targets brides and grooms. The murder portion of story is good, typical Patterson, with one too many twists at the end for my taste. However, he should be soundly beaten for some of the ""characterizations"" he does of the female characters. I don't normally get annoyed by gender stereotypes, but if those women don't quit slobbering all over each other, I don't know if I'll be able to stomach the second book of the series."
4,"Real characters, fast paced tale and a startling conclusion","Intriguing characters bring this James Patterson novel to life.When newlyweds are being murdered, Lindsay Boxer, a homicide investigator in San Francisco, takes charge. While her personal life is in disarray she continues to hunt for whoever is behind these murders. She brings together three friends of hers, all professional working women with different areas of expertise, who carefully sift through all the clues to track down the cold blooded killer. Meanwhile, they also help each other out in their private lives to deal with a personal crisis that threatens to destroy one of them. Patterson does a remarkable job of creating a reality to these women that really holds the story together to it's startling conclusion."
4,Fast-Paced Thriller,"If I want a fast=paced cannot put down thriller, Patterson never lets me down. This book was not as good as his Alex Cross novels, but nonetheless, it was fast paced and kept me guessing until the end. Patterson is a great writer, and really knows how to keep the pages turning. I look forward to more ""Women's Murder Club"" books. The main characters are good ones -- very real people."
4,"Watch out, Alex! You have competition!","Through the eyes of Inspector Lindsay Boxer, Patterson has created a fast-paced and emotional tale that grabs you from the first page and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Complimented by a murder plot which is both sinister and complex, the reader is drawn into the Women's Murder Club and its four unique and intriguing members. With more twists and turns than a mountain pass, this book will keep you guessing, and make you cringe, cry, laugh, and cheer!"
3,interesting at best,"I found this difficult to read. At times way to slow, some unneeded violence. Not up to his earlier standards."
4,. . . kept me gripped . . . !,"One reviewer of this book claims that ""newcomers to his work will be enthralled."" And so I was . . . !Set in San Francisco, this book has more twist and turns than Lombard Street itself. The four women at the centre of the Women's Murder Club, each have their own vested interest in the recent spate of serial killings, and in trapping the 'animal' behind them.This book has the typical romance and personal tragedies but my only criticism would be that Patterson doesn't go far enough into his characters - something I'm sure he puts right in the second book in this series, 2nd Chance.I can't wait to read it."
4,Ist to Die,"This is the first in the Women's Murder Club series and it is the first James Patterson book I've read. He is a popular and prolific writer, and this thriller doesn't disappoint. It may not be great literature, but it is easy reading with very short chapters and it keeps the reader's interest to the end. The reason I read the book is because of the TV series based on these books about four women -- a detective, a medical examiner, a crime reporter and an assistant district attorney -- who band together to solve crimes. They call themselves the Women's Murder Club. In this first book Detective Lindsay Boxer is also battling a serious illness and is involved in a romance as well as solving a series of murders. This is a good book to take along on a trip. It will help pass the time at the airport and on the plane."
3,IT's OK,"I didn't really LOVE this book due to the fact that you are told who killed the newlyweds in the beginning. Also I felt that the characters were one-dimensional as I could not relate to them or ""get inside their heads"". Overall it was a bit of a disappointment and I am sorry to say I will not be reading the other books in this series."
5,fan and follower of mysteries,patterson delivers another winner. a winning series for fans of good mysteries. readers will not be disappointed.good read and adventure
2,"This book was in very poor shape, not good shape as described","This book was in very poor shape, not good shape as described. I've bought many used books and when they are described as good shape, they've come that way. The last two times I've bought used books they were not as described."
5,My first read of Mr. Pattersons books,I am in love with the writing of this book - cant wait to start my journey into reading more of his books
5,relate,I could make myself fit into the book! Totally fit into the book - can't wait to order the next book!
3,A Decent Read,"While I have read other more gripping authors, this book had moments when I couldn't wait to turn the page. The characters lacked depth, but were not so shallow that they detracted from the story. The twists were good, though mostly expected and the killer was sufficiently evil. I recommend it as a fast read and worth the time though there are better."
4,GOOD BUT...,"I like the idea of having different women, from different back ground but I would like to know more from each of thoses girls.A fast reading book, not complicated and the title is very appropriated."
4,fun thriller with women sleuths,"James Patterson writes fast-paced thrillers and this is no exception. Short chapters keep the pace moving as we meet four professional women who have formed the Women's Murder Club. The police detective, medical examiner, district attorney and journalist pool their resources over margaritas as they try to solve the murders of newlyweds in the San Francisco area. Each in turn discovers valuable information that brings the investigation forward, and Patterson writes insightfully about each profession as the killer's identity is revealed. Or is it? This is a fun thriller and well-written. I will definitely read more books by this author and look forward to others in this series."
5,You won't put it down!,"I am a huge fan of James Patterson, John Sanford, Jonathan Kellerman and John Grisham, this is Patterson at his best! I started the Painted House and could not get into it so I switched to 1st to Die and I could not put it down. It moves quickly and just when I thought I figured it all out he surprises you. The new characters are interesting and fun. It is easy reading and very exciting. I can't wait for the next book. I was afraid to try the new series, but I am so glad I did."
2,I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO TO THIS BOOK,"I READ THE 3RD BOOK BEFORE I EVER KNEW IT WAS A SERIES. TODAY, I HAVE TRIED TO READ THIS ONE BUT JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT.SO, I SCANNED IT.I HAVE THE 2ND CHANCE TO YET READ BUT I WILL WAIT AWHILE.ACTUALLY, I THINK I'LL STICK WITH PATTERSON'S NON SERIES BOOKS. I LOVED BEACH HOUSE AND LAKE HOUSE SO MAYBE IT IS THE SERIES. IN THE ALEX CROSS BOOKS, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE SKIPS AROUND WITH THE CHAPTERS SO I AM HAVING TO QUIT THAT SERIES.AREN'T WE GLAD THAT DIFFERENT WRITERS WRITE BOOKS????"
2,Patterson Projects Himself,"We can only see what we are is a theory of quantum physics.Therefore when James Patterson makes his serial killer a vegetarianand his detective a ribs eater, he is projecting his own guiltat being the serial killer of animals, at being the payer ofthe hitmen at the slaughterhouse.In actuality, violence is correlated so strongly to the murderat the slaughterhouse and the consumption of cadavers thatin the 19th Century, butchers were not allowed to sit on Britishjuries."
3,Ladies Four,"Here we have four ladies involved in police work: a detective, a medical examiner, an assistant DA, and a reporter. Each has a piece of the puzzle to solve the crime. (This is the first of Patterson's ""Women's Murder Club."") They manage to solve the crime a little at a time. The story has Patterson's surprises and it is a page-turner. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
2,"1 Star as a ""Book"", 3 Stars as a ""Genre Book""","I read this book as an attempt to broaden my horizons as a casual reader - never much for mysteries - and I wound up wanting to put it down 1/2 way through.Like other reviewers, I found the characters to be fairly thin confections, and the plot to be overly twisty. But my biggest problem is simply that the Author ""cheats"". By that I mean that instead of simple misdirection, sections of the book are written that, in light of later developments, simply ""aren't true"".I guess I'm used to straightforward books where you read what is before you, and can more or less trust it. But when you read something that is abruptly twisted later on, or ignored, or given an almost unbelievable interpretation to make the plot creak along, well, my ""suspension of disbelief"" flies right out the window.The last chapter of the book was just too much. Ugh. I may try another mystery, but not in this series, and perhaps, not ever again one by Patterson."
1,Uncharacteristically lame Patterson book,"James Patterson is capable of much more than this book delivers. It definatly sounds like a Patterson novel, with the requesite style and character development. The mystery is good, as is most of the plot. However, the ""women's murder club"" idea sounds like a shameless plea to the Lifetime Network for a movie deal. I cringed with every page about Detective Boxer's personal problems and just about couldn't make it through the scenes about her murder club meetings.Skip this series and go read an Alex Cross Patterson novel instead."
3,Disappointing ending,"I have read a couple of Patterson's books in the past,not my favorite author but I have enjoyed the new TV series so I wanted to try one of this series. The premise is good and the hunt for the killer was interesting enough. The characters except for the main character Lindsay were one-dimensional though. I was also somewhat disappointed in the ending. It seemed to have just been tacked on quickly to ""get it over with."" I would have preferred more explaination of how and why the crimes were pulled off."
4,First in the Women's Murder Club,"I have been looking for books to read while torturing myself on machines at the gym. James Patterson books are perfect for this. They have short chapters (5 pages, usually), are written in a fast pace, have more than one layer of plot going on (main plot and at least one thing going on with the characters outside the main plot), and are told from multiple points of view.I really enjoy this series of books (women's murder club) because they are from the point of view of a female detective. Kind of like JDRobb's series of books - the powerful woman who still is a woman is an empathetic lead, for me.I've read a few other patterson books - notably kiss the girls (which completely freaked me out) and when the wind blows (which was a neato sci-fi ride), but I like this series best.(*)>"
4,"5 Stars for the Movie, but One Off for the Ending of the Book.","Everytime the film version of this James Patterson book is run on cable TV, I just love to sit and watch the entire 4-hour adventure. Tracey Pollan, did a great job as police office Lindsay Boxer, and the movie was very fast-paced without getting as detailed as Patterson's book.Well, I have finally read the book, and am eternally grateful they left certain details of the crime scenes out of the movie, because they were pretty disgusting. I would also like to say, as another reviewer pointed out, that the ending wasn't too good, but the movie did it a favor. Now, why couldn't Patterson have thought of that version himself? Still, a really good crime thriller with lots of great twists and turns."
3,Hope this series gets better,"I recently read this novel on a plane trip. It was very easy to read, as is typical in a Patterson novel. However, this is the first that I have ever read of the ""Women's Murder Club."" Based on this first reading, I will give the second in the series a try, but, this did not live up to the quality of the Cross series, or some of other Patterson's other samplings.I think that Patterson tried way too hard to get inside the head of a woman to write it from that perspective. I felt like the romance portions were way, way, way overdone. I also thought the mystery portion of the book was a little too predictable.Once again, I am willing to give Patterson a pass based on his entire body of work, but this one BARELY got a 3 star rating from me. If the second book in this series follows this vein, I will set them aside for good."
5,Brilliant! Can't wait to read the next one!,"Love James Patterson, love the Alex Cross series of books. Can't wait to start the next one in this series."
3,Liked the ending,I liked this book but it got slow at times. But I liked it enough to read #2 thanks james
4,1st to die,james patterson does it again it really held your interrest I would rrecomend it to my friends And family great
4,1st to Die,"Didn't like the end. I was dissapointed after all she suffed. I love happy endings..., maybe I'm a romantic fool, but I might read the second..."
3,Intrigue to the end.,This book had me second guessing myself almost to the end. I was sad that her lover had to die and she didn't get the happy ending she deserved.
3,Okay,This book was okay. I plan on reading the next one. Hate when they kill a good character and you didn't expect it.
5,Great read!,"It was a really good book that kept me on my toes. Just when I thought I knew what was coming n ext, Patterson threw me a curve ball!"
4,A fast read,"This got my attention from the first page, however, there were several flaws! For instance, no one has a ""cabin"" in Modesto, California. The San Francisco ME would NOT have the samples from the inverstigation in Ohio. I found it annoying that every other page is a new chapter. Why does the writer do that?? It was very distracting. Despite all of this, it was enthralling for me. The language is simple and straightforward. It's a bit like junk TV... no moral, no bigger message, just entertainment. Don't expect great literature, and you'll enjoy!"
5,Wow!,"Just as Alex Cross stories were beginning to sound a little bit strained, there comes Women's Murder Club! Four tough ladies, thorougly professional, solving cases on their own, outside official guidelines, but effectively.The book is full of Paterson-twists, unespected bad guys popping out at the end and a wonderfully twisted end.Maybe not Patterson's best, but among the best."
1,"Plot was all ""1st to Die"" had going for it","When I bought this book, I didn't think it would be any good. My suspicions were actually quite accurate. I'm just happy I only spent eight dollars or so on it!!! I'll admit Patterson's plot for this book was pretty brilliant, but that was all it had going for it. His writing skills aren't too good. His character development was bad & the way he portrayed the newlyweds couldn't have been more cliched. It really made me want to gag. There has to be a way to write a thriller/mystery without the descriptions being cheesy. There are novels like this that have literary quality. In my opinion, any author who chucks out novels this quickly , it means the books won't be that great. But, hey, if you just want something to keep you guessing & don't mind that aside from the plot, the writing is pathetic, go for it."
4,Good audio book,Good book. I suspect women would like it more than men (me). But its a good story and I enjoyed it.
2,"Sick, sick, sick!","Not at all up to typical James Patterson quality. I overlooked the sick, sick, sick sexual aspect of the murders, but the twists and turns near the end -- without any logical explanation as to how they could possibly have happened -- did me in. I'm so sorry I wasted my time on this one -- and am at a loss as to why so many people liked it."
2,Not very impressed,"It was okay but a little too contrived. It gave me the impression that Patterson sat around and wrote a bunch of flash cards and said, ""I'll go this direction, add this twist, then this twist"" and then he filled in the space in between with filler material. In the process he creates this woman's group that would be preposterous I suspect in the real world. Then when he finished his book he sat back and said... ""One more twist! Viola. I created a masterpiece."" Only his coup de gras looked like it was written as an afterthought and looked like it was written in 30 minutes. The real coup de gras should have been his published mailing this one back.The question now is do I want to try another Patterson novel. Answer: Yes. But if it's as lame as 1st to Die, I'll go back to Michael Connelly."
4,Very Pleased,I found the book to be very enjoyable and at times didn't want to put it down. I do recommend it..
3,BayRyder,"It was interesting cast of characters , the story moved along good & plot was OK ,thought the woman's club came together to pat & ending wasn't as good as it could have been although it was a good twist . All in all it was OK ."
1,The book's popularity shows the public's bad taste,"After seeing this authors books listed on the best seller's list for quite a while, I finally decided to read this one. What a disapointment. I would have expected the plot of this book to appear in one of the tabloids, it is that bad. A best selling novelist kills married couples on their first night in their hotel rooms after the wedding ceremonies and then sexually abuses the dead brides. This killer also abuses his several spouses. The author also creates a policewoman with a terminal illness and the secondary plot of her battle with her ailment which adds little to the storyline while she strives to solve this absurd tale of a serial murderer. The prose is very simplistic. I have difficulty trying to understand what possible entertainment or merit readers'can find in this work. If you have not read this book yet, don't bother."
3,Good,"This isn't the best thriller I've read (that would be Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE), but I have a fascination with serial killers, and this was a page-turning tale about one. Summer's coming up, so get it to read by the pool. It's that kind of book."
1,Out of ideas...,"There are some writters who only have so many good books in them. James Patterson is a prime example of such an author. Boring is the best I can say about this book. I was hoping that with a new cast of characters Mr. Patterson would come back as a strong storyteller, but was sadly disappointed. Any book that runs over 400 pages and can be read in less than three hours must suffer from severe lack of depth or childish prose. This book can proudly claim both.As a long time reader I keep picking up his books and believing I will find another gem like Along Came A Spider or Jack and Jill.This is NOT it."
1,Very disappointing,"It's hard to believe the author of the Alex Cross novels has sunk this low.Most of the plot twists are telegraphed well in advance. But the worse problem is that this book is poorly written. Characters frequently mouth the obvious (in case you missed it), and if that is not enough, there is a movie-style ""epilogue"" with a gratuitous attack scene, presumably so that the reader can feel good about killing off a particular character. Just dreadful: poor writing, cliché after cliché in the characters, a hokey plot. Shame on you, James Patterson."
1,Rarely Have I Been This Angry at an Author,"The book starts out promising...you like the main characters and wonder where it is going. Then you get to 3/4 of the way through --1. Did the author forget about the scenes he wrote about the killer in the beginning? (his end just does not fit and was directly contradictory to the chapters he wrote in the beginning)2. Did he find a likeable male lead just didn't fit the mold of the ""Women's Murder Club""? That must be the case because he killed off a likeable main character with no reason or advancement to the plot.Rarely have I read a book where it was so obvious that the author was having trouble making his deadline. It's a shame because the promise of an excellent book was there. Hence, the only thing I felt at the end of this book was anger."
4,Twisted plot,James Patterson does a great job in engaging the reader in a novel that brings shivers down ur spine. Nothing in this book is how it appears to be. You assume that youve figured everything out at the very end you find out you were wrong. Great quick read.
4,More than worth your time...,"I have not read too many James Patterson books but I did find that this one was very good. I thought that Patterson did a great job developing and writing from Detective Boxer's voice.It's very unpredictable, which is why I liked, has many twists, which is another good point. Except for the few forced twists at the end I thought it was very enjoyable. I still enjoyed the ending though..."
1,A TRUE MYSTERY,HOW DID MR.PATTERSON EVER MAKE THE GRADE? WHY DID I BUY THIS BOOK?I FEEL FOOLISH AND VICTIMIZED.
1,waste of time,"I don't even know what to say about this book. I gave it one star because I did finish it to the end, but mostly because I was trying to figure out what led to the appeal of the Womens Murder Mystery Club. This is the first book of theirs and I won't be reading another.Total fluff--I feel like this is chicklit--written by a man about how he believes women talk to each other. maybe some do. Or maybe he read too many romance novels. I found the whole book to be totally unbelievable. The mystery itself was pretty good, but the other characters were not very real."
1,Disappointing,"Well, this had a lot of good reviews, and I wanted to get a Patterson novel as I heard they were good reads. I do agree this was a page-turner and an easy read that was good for a long airline flight, but it reminded me of a made-for-TV movie. No character development, very contrived, poor writing, and basically light weight when compared to products from great mystery writers such as Peter Robinson, Colin Dexter, or Michael Connelly. The book is pure fluff and leaves you feeling as if you ate a lot of cotton candy. I would not recommend it for readers who like intelligent reads."
3,Obviously written by a man.,"I have enjoyed the few JP novels that I have read in the past, and was looking to get my fix until the new Patricia Cornwell novel comes out.1st to Die simply does not deliver. I had a very hard time believing the main character. The opening cliffhanging scene is hastily brushed off at the end. The romance between the main characters is not exactly believable. The attempt at a climatic ending is rushed and almost laughable.Despite all of it's shortcomings, the novel was suspenseful enough to keep my attention through the end. I hope the next novel in the series is executed more smoothly."
4,The 1st Book,"Alice's mother died when she was young, leaving her alone with her 19 year old brother Lester, and her Dad. This book, and the whole series, is how she struggles through growing up without a female role model.When Alice first starts 6th grade, she is certain she will be in the class with the most beautiful teacher, who will be her perfect role model. Instead, she is chosen for plain, old Mrs. Plotkin. She tries to get kicked out of her class, but with hilarious results. Alice learns that you need to pay more attention to the inside, than the outside.I enjoyed this book. I think a lot of kids can relate to this book. Who here hasn't wanted the most beautiful teacher? I recommend you also read the rest of the series too."
3,Good But Not Great,Now that I am reading the series in order I am surprised to see how much younger Alice seems in this book compared to the last prequel. That's not to say that I don't enjoy this book. I just think she seems younger than she really is. This book is definitely enjoyable for both children (I first read this in fourth grade) and adults. It is a quick and easy read.
2,eh...,"It was entertaining but it doesn't compare to the great tried and true young adult series: The Anastasia books by Lois Lowry. Those are humorous and inventive, this seems as if it is a compilation of a lot of young adult books, dealing ineffectually with every problem under the sun."
4,Amazing.......,"Phyliss Reynolds Naylor ,normally sex obsessed, has actually written an ALICE book that does not mention something sexual or dirty on every 2nd or 3rd page!!In fact she doesn't mention anything sexual at all.Kudos to you,Miss Naylor!!!How did she do it??We actually have a really decent,and interesting,Alice novel for all ages,in The Agony of Alice.Truly amazing.This novel is about 13 year old Alice who is self-conscious and awkward,living through her first few days or weeks as a seventh grader,and her desperate need for a mother.I recommend this book but not the others."
3,Agony All the Way,"I just finished a book called The Agony of Alice. It's about a 4th grader who wants a role model. When she finds the perfect person for her role model, she end up not getting her for a 4th grade teacher. Will Alice ever get the perfect role model she needs? Read the Agony of Alice for a lot of reading fun.In the Agony of Alice, Alice ended up getting Ms. Plotkin as a 4th grade teacher. This was not who she wanted. This has happened to me many times too when I didn't get the teacher I wanted through elementary school. Alice also went to go visit her aunt in Chicago. I have also gone to visit family far away too. If you are looking for a fun book to read about the life of a crazy fourth grader, make sure to read The Agony of Alice."
3,This book isnt really for kids 11 going on 12,"i think children 11 going on 12 shouldnt read this because reasons are they might relate their life to alice and maybe get confused. they shouldnt be knowing about periods and bras because duh, they might want one even though their still flat. alice' life shows misery and stupidity. especially her and the halloween costume and her levis jeans. it was so embarrassing. and for merlin's sake she's still twelve and she's kissing a boy with chocolate on his lips? dont think soi think the alice character is a bit overeacting. she acts like she's too ignorant to find her own jean size. i started buying jeans on my own since i was 10 and my mom was away at work and my dad was out too. so alice is just too stupid.i dont believe there is or will be such a character. man, its just unbelievable. lie saying cinderella is realanyway, it was a good story..."
5,"""Alice doesn't know how to grow up""","Alice doesn't have anyone to help her grow up. Her mother died when Alice was young, so all she lives with is her father and brother. This is one event: When Alice's brother takes her shopping, he takes her to the boys section for clothes. Then the sales clerk tells them they need to go to the girl's department.This was the second Alice book I have read. I first read Alice in Rapture, Sort Of. I wrote a review on it too. I am just now starting ""Reluctantly Alice"""
3,funny bt a little dull,This boook is about a girl who moves to a suberb close to her old house. Her mother is dead and boy does she want a mother she lives with her dad a music store owner and her 20 year old brother she moves just in time to start 6th grade and that is when the fun begins!!!
4,A good read for adolescent girls,"I love the Alice series, I am one of Phylis Reynold Naylor's great big stampeding fans, but--to be truthful to you, buddy boy--I didn't find this one nearly as riveting as the others. It is interesting and a good start for the other books, just a little slow. I really did love the whole Alice/Patrick saga and Alice's emotions are just like any girl's. If you want to feel all sorts of things--happy, sad, EMBARRASSED, angry, angst, disapointed, hysterically tickled, numb, and just plain content--follow along with Alice in her first adventure. Read the other books in order, as well, as Alice grows physically and mentally.A GREAT READ!If you want some more emotions read the rest of the Alice series, The Princess Diaries Series by Meg Cabot, the Georgia Nicholson Series by LOuise Rennison and the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling.BLESSED BE!!!"
5,The Agony of Alice,The Agony of Alice.The author of this book is Phyllis Reynolds Naylor.The main character is Alice. Alices mother died when she was just a baby. So now so she is in sixth grade and she just wants someone to teach her to be a teenager. She has a big brother(Lester) and a dad. the plot of this story is she gets a boyfriend and she just wants to ask questions on how to keep a boyfriend and how to prevent(Patrick)from breaking up with her. Alices quote is sixth grade is tough.The meaning of this story is how to be a teenager with a boyfriend.I really like this story because im in sixth grade and im figureing out how to be a teenager with out screwing up.
4,"Not the best, but it was still great!","As the first Alice book in the series, I'm not sure how it continued, but I'm glad. It defenitly was not the best Alice book, but it was still great. I wasn't found of it, but I still read it in2 days. The Grooming of Alice was the first Alice book I read, (I hadn't discovered the whole series), and this was the fourth. Some of the funny parts in the book was when she wanted to get Miss Cole and went to the principal's office just so he'd swicth her! I'll say that toward the end I really enjoyed it, so if it seems a little dull in the beginning, I'll tell you it gets a WHOLE lot better. I still really liked this one!-Scooby"
1,You have got to be kidding,"My first stop for finding this character for my kid was Amazon. Shame on them for linking me to someone charging 12 times the $4.99 price for a plastic figure. This is not a collectors item, it's a kids toy. Don't support these heartless people trying to ripoff 6 year olds."
1,disapointed,"I would have liked to write a review about this product. However, my three year old grandson received from this seller a NFL Bears Jacket men's size large instead of the SpongeBob blanket he should have received."
4,Cool,Will recommend to friends. Cheaper price with the durable shield for use in a teenagers car. Will probably buy for third vehicle.
4,Shostakovich on a Shoestring,"As a teenage conneseiur of classical music, I can't exactly dish out the money that some other recordings of the complete Shostakovich String Quartets cost. This is the best you can get for the money, and worth much more! The sound quality is fantastic, and I find little wrong with the CDs. While I prefer the Kronos Quartet's phrasing (particularly on the 8th string quartet), the Rubio's mellower sound is a nice alternative, and adds a contrast to the otherwise pessimistic music of Dmitri Shostakovich. Named in honor of the late instrument maker Rubio, they all play on his instruments. In part due to this continuity of instrument, and part due to their extraordinary musicality, the recordings have a very unified sound. This is a great find!"
5,Funny and Insightful,"I began Cracker Ingenuity with high expectations after reading and enjoying P. T. Elliot's last book, 100 Proof. I was not to be disappointed. Cracker Ingenuity is hysterical. The content is totally true blue redneck America with an eye for appreciation of this side of our culture rather than condescension. Many of the ""ingenuities"" had me actually laughing in my seat as I read and the illustrations seem to fit the authors' ideas perfectly. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a bit of insight into a part of the U.S. that, while somewhat rough around the edges, is likely in all of us."
1,"Funny, approaching satire, not very original","Another reviewer notice that some of the material bears an erie similarity to several Web sites on the topic. Without leveling a charge of direct copying one way or the other there is some VERY similar writing online. (Students, Authors and Publishers take note: Google knows everything...)While I realize that this book is a sometimes sucessful attempt at satire it also has several gross fabrications made up so that they could be satirized or simply add to the page count. Com'on reality is so much richer than fiction and much funnier to satirize. YAWN."
1,Save Your Money,"Unfortunately, most of the information in this book appears to be gleamed from websites of the same topic. Some of the items even look completely ripped from two sites that are easily found using a websearch for Trailer Park.I will admit that it is well put together, but lacks its own originality."
3,"1 good, 1 bad","Bought two sets for a trip to Jamaica. 1 set performed well. The other, the pin that the mask strap weaves through, broke the first time my wife tried to put it on. U.S. Divers list a two year warranty on the package. I have contacted the seller: Red Rock Products, Inc. and they are issuing a return label (although I have not seen the return info yet and I called them about a week ago). Not sure if I'll get a replacement or a refund. This is an OK set for the price and hopefully the broken mask is a freak thing."
2,"interesting, but difficult to read","I am familiar with literature on death and dying, have read Kuebler Ross, Moody and similar ones, but this was my fisrt book from EJ Gold. Some talks like ""The Deathbed Perspective"" and ""The Winnipeg Nine"" make it already worthwile to buy the book. However, for the uninitiated the context is not always easy to grasp. The talks refer to exercises and experiences, which mean nothing or very little if one is not familiar with ""The school"" which is at times referred to. I am quite sure that with a better introduction and background of Gold's teachings, the book would be more valuable. I didn't have this key to unlock the essence of some of the talks. My next purchase will be the American Book of the Dead to look for these clues."
4,Classic Country with a touch of bluegrass,"Isla Grant is a great country performer. I found her while browsing You Tube, and really liked her music. Her CD's were first avilable as CD imports at fairly high prices. I finally checked Amazon's MP3 store and found what I was looking for at a reasonable price. This is one of two Isla Grant albums I've purchased. If you like classic country, preview the album. You'll like it."
3,Disappointing!,"The instrumental music is beautifully done, but I can't recommend the album because it lacks vocal talent, but this is just my opinion. Some of the best selections are: Estampie; Ahi!Amors, Com Dure Departie; Sexte Estampie Real; Ar Ne Kuth Ich Sorghe Non (Dance); and Cuer Disirrous Apaie."
3,My child loves to play with these letters,My child who is 3 loves to lay these out on the table and try to build words with them. She asks to play with them every night. They are not super durable but I am glad we bought them.
1,Now Worth The Price,"I ordered these letters to use as stencils for a youth group. When they are punched out of the whole sheet they are not smooth - they have protrusions all around them; thus they are difficult to trace - especially for younger children. For the price of these letters the die cut should have been much more defined so that they are traceable. And, if you can't trace them they are virtually useless."
5,Our absolute favorite game!,This is such a great game! Adults and kids of all ages can play it. I taught my kids to play it before they were even in school and their knowledge and strategy ability have grown so much over the years. It's a quick game to play and so easy to learn.
5,Works Perfect,"The product worked as described, all the parts were there, and I recieved it in a timely manner."
3,nice to have,"the clix is one of the best looking mp3/video player i owned. very intuitive menu system and great sound and video quality but when it comes to synching podcasts look elsewhere, ie: ipod.It also suffers from a battery charging issue. It looses charge very quickly even if not used and will not vharge unless it is totaly discharged.Their customer support is not responsive to be polite. Mine got broken and I tried calling them several times but other then a very annoying recording wasn't able to get anybody to answer. after 2 emails and a week i finally got an email back saying my broken clix is not covered under warranty. they didn't even offer to fix it for a cost.In summary, i liked the clix but after my experience i will not be getting a new one."
4,A Great Little Gadget!,"I bought this based on a Consumer Reports recommendation. I haven't explored it thoroughly yet, but I am enjoying the FM radio right now.Accessories are expensive (i.e., a case w/velcro armband cost $20.00)"
4,Excellent Purchase - glad I did,"I am really glad I purchased this product. I love it's size and it's easy to manouver. I would recommend this mp3 player to anyone interested in something small that will hold a lot of songs and that you can use anywhere. Thanks to Amazon too for having it, it's very hard to find in stores.Great job all around - thank you."
5,Great,"I had this product a few years back and it was GREAT for the time period. It worked wonderfully and even had a radio option (unlike most electronics at the time). Now, since we are in 2011, this electronic might seem a bit outdated (along with the zune)- but still, I think the product was very efficient and i was very happy with it!"
4,I like it!,Easy to upload music and delete.The only thing I'm confused about is using the playlist by choosing songs already in the device.
4,FANTASTIC Little Device.,"It has everything that I could ask of an mp3, all in the cutest package. Aside from the fact that it IS adorable, it has great functionality, and a very intuitive interface. I've heard complaints about the low fps for it's supported videos, but I uploaded Dane Cook's ""Vicious Circle"" onto it, and the quality is great. Note that the clix is picky about it's video, so all you have to do is download a small 3rd party program called iRiverter. It's really easy, and I don't know why people are complaining about it.I have but one qualm about this device, and it actually lies with the software. Windows Media Player is a horrible program, and you'll find yourself switching between putting files onto the device via Windows Explorer and WMP.And... that's about it, really. I say buy it, 'cause it really is worth it."
3,Nice if the battery worked and if it had better documentation.,"Besides VERY POOR documentation in showing new users how to use the features and menus, this unit would have been nice if you like a SMALL unit. Unfortunately, I returned my unit because the battery only charged for 3-4 hours of use."
4,Good Stuff,"This is a good DVD with lots of aggressive action. There is very little in the way of action down below, though. I would still recommend it."
1,bad production,"The dvd quality is good, but the production of this story is bad. The producer and directors need to come up with new idea and techniques to make movie"
3,Is my CD correct?,"I just got my coy of Rich Mullins' Here In America yesterday and I'm listening to it today. I haven't watched the DVD yet. The CD is entertaining to hear. I am perplexed about the last track, track 13. My CD player shows the time of this track to be just over 19 minutes. There is The Lord's Prayer, about 2 minutes long. Then there is about a one minute silence (blank space), then Rich teaches the audience to ""make rain"", after which there is another silent/blank space of about 5 minutes, followed by Rich's final talk. And at the end of it, he is saying ""the only possible reason ... to tell people about Jesus is that we all need a savior."" The CD ends abruptly at that point. Is this the way everyone else's copy is recorded? Thanks for any responses."
1,Pinnacle Support?,"Example of Pinnacle Customer Support,Studio 8 worked fine, sluggish, but for my needs fine.Upgraded to Studio 9Does not work at all.Customer support wait time 45-80 minutes.Custom support once you actually get someone.NoneZeroZipZilchPinnacle works great when it works great. As for customer support, I would gladly pay 10 times as much for a product that works AND customer service that is actually there. You'll love Pinnacle Products as long as it works great. But, when you need customer support, you're better off asking your dead great-great-grandmother.Better Business Bureau have a 1-800 line?"
1,Customer Service,"I have to agree with the first reviewer who had some significant problems with Pinnacle Customer Service. I have returned a unit to them because of faulty manufacture, and have heard nothing from the Company since. No new box, no repaired box, and no response to e-mails. The next stop is the Better Business Bureau. Suggest that anyone considering Pinnacle Systems hardware go to their online support forum and see all of the examples of poor support. I wish I had done that prior to purchase."
2,"Okay, but buggy","Like all video editing equipment for your computer, you'll need a state of the art system. If not, expect to run any rendering overnight. The software is much slower than other programs out there for video editing. Also, make sure you've striped your tapes before EVERY record, or else the box will lock-up frequently. Once you've got everything in place, a systematic way to create your projects, and know how to overcome the poorly designed GUI, the box works great! Oh, and once you've got a stable version running, don't upgrade! This is a flawed product for a hefty price, but if you want to save your VHS tapes to DVD, it works (I've been using it for about six months now)."
5,As easy as the Flash Preview listed here,"The software is very easy to use. Watch the Flash preview of Pinnacle Studio that's posted here on this Amazon listing. It's that easy. And a real gem that's not mentioned is the sleek hardware unit that allows you to plug in analog or digital devices (say from VCRs, analog camcorders, digital camcorders) and transfer to your computer (advisable to have a firewire port). The unit sits on your desk for easy access to plug in your peripherals and you run a firewire cable down to your computer. Great package!"
4,Pleasantly happy,I bought this product hoping to edit my home movies and it was fairly easy and intuitive. I'm happy I got it and I'm sure I'll be using it a lot more to start editing my movies and burning them to dvd.
3,Only because it's 'Plumb',"I was turned onto Plumb from the Brokedown Palace soundtrack & her song ""Damaged' (which by the way is on 'Blush'). I went in search of more of her & was pleased with most of what I found. I just got into her again when I heard one of her radio songs from 'Blink'. I decided to buy both 'Beautiful lumps of coal' & 'Blush'. Unfortunately I rendered BLOC pretty much unlistenable. Her soft, quavering voice is totally over run on most songs by overpowering guitar riffs & drum blasts in the chorus. I hated it & almost cried because I was sooo looking forward to finding a gem or two on here. But it sounds irritating & noisy :( I enjoy loud guitar/drum tracks on my NIN or Marilyn Manson stuff, but it doesnt work for me when I want to listen to soft pretty Plumb. When something is not what you expected it can be a pleasant surprise. Well I wasnt expecting this 'noise' over her voice, but it was definitely not a pleasant surprise."
2,disappointed,"I purchased Plumb's recent greatest hits CD and enjoyed it, so I decided to get this one and was very disappointed. She has such a beautiful voice but not one of the songs captured my interest. I was also disappointed that her songs were not Christian focused. I am a big fan of her voice but not this CD!"
4,Good -- but not as magnificent as her past,"I bought Beautiful Lumps of Coal just today and listened through it several times. It is a very good album, although I expected better. Being a Plumb fan for quite a while, I grew to love Tiffany Arbuckle's old songs, whether it be Stranded, Damaged, or Late Great Planet Earth. The songs on this record to do not seem to have the uniqueness of some of the past songs. Possibly this is a record that will just have to grow on me, just like the others?Album highlights - Hold Me, Nice Naive and Beautiful, and Real."
2,What happened,"I have difficulties liking most of the mainstream music, and yet I really liked Candycoated... especially ""Stranded"". There was a special sound on that one that maked it unique. But I was really let down when I received this one. Plumb has turned into your average, boring mainstream act. It even tastes 80's Bonnie Tyler sometimes."
4,Plumb Beautiful Music!!,"Plumb is an awesome artist, who has a bit of a feel like Jewel, but with a bit edgier sound. This CD is easy listening, with clear vocals and music that touches your heart and a beat that gets you singing at the top of your lungs.Give it a spin and you'll agree!"
5,A street fighter,"when ever I got in to a street fight, before I read this book, I could not control my rage and from the adrenaline my hands whould shake and I would pretty much go crazy. Than still a while after I would still fell the affect. After raeding this book these things no nonger happen. Now I am cool under pressure and win almost all of my fights now. Well, I'm lying, not all but I am alot better at it. So if you have excess stress when fighting which causes you to preform less than 100% and would like to perform at 100%. BUY THIS BOOK."
2,"Heavy on theory, short on practical advice","I bought this book thinking that it would provide useful tips to improve a martial arts training regimen. I was sorely disappointed. Most of the book deals with theory and background, with very little useful info for a martial artist. The only really good piece of info I found in this book is that your fine and complex motor skills degrade as your heart rate increases (such as when you are scared and fighting for your life). There was one chapter on firearms training for urban combat, but that would be more useful to a police tactical team or a military unit rather than a martial artist. A psychology major might find this book interesting reading, but for help on martial arts training, better books would be ""Fighter's Fact Book"" by Christensen, ""Get Tough"" by Fairbairn, or ""Complete Krav Maga"" by Levine and Whitman."
4,A lecture for The mind!,"I really took this book straight into my heart as a tool for selfeenhancing your mind and abilities! As an millitary enthusiast and with special millitary training, i can approve of this book and ord content to be highly valid for becoming more secure i stressfull and confrontal areas of your everyday life and combat. Both law enforcement, millitary and martiall art! The book teaches you how to focus your abilities at The task at hand, and has some important points when it comes to The human mindset when learning, and when instructions goes from implementing to applying in stressfull situations!I highly recommand this book to everyone who wants expert guidence in both teaching, mind controll and controll over stressfull situations!"
4,This book has helped make me a better teacher,I believe I am a better karate teacher and that my self-protection seminars are better for having read this book.[...]
1,Buyer Beware,"Had bought this thinking it would be a good read and provide insight into training aspects for my martial arts. Feel asleep reading the second chapter. I have no idea why all these people rank it five stars as I found it not only boring, but repetitive and useless. There's even a disclaimer in the book stating that it's repetitive!I think I read too much into the title for this book and, not being a part of the military, found it lacking."
5,For Teachers of the Warriors,"After reading the book ""on combat"", i found it necessary to explore books with similar themes. Of course nobody can learn just by reading a book, you need to actually put it to use through practice. Instructors must utilyze all the resources made available to them and not be biased towards one form of teaching...this will cause restraints in the ever evolving world of learning and most important, teaching people to become warriors."
2,binding mess,"The written information in the book is great, just as I anticipated it would be, however the binding on the book was loose and most of the pages in the book separated from the spine. I am very disappointed especially because the majority of my experiences from amazon have been satisfactory until now."
5,Something Plant invented,"Manic Nirvana (1989) is a very unique sound and style for Robert Plant. It's a sound and style of music that, as he said, he invented. This music is a blend of hard rock, metal, pop, and synthesizers. It works. All of the songs rule, but my personal favorites are:She SaidAnniversaryTie Dye On The HighwayNirvanaHurting KindThis is my second favorite Robert Plant solo album, ranking behind Pictures At Eleven (1982). It rocks. I highly recommend it."
5,another rocking solo effort,"Robert Plant is truly one of the greatest artists of our time, he records the most rockin and compelling music i've ever listened to, and when he his together with his counterpart Jimmy Page they rule the damn planet."
4,"Good album, Great concert.","This album came in 1990 which is the year I graduated high school and so therefore may be more sentimental for me than anything but I can't help but love this record. ""I cried"" is my favorite cut. A great song with some of the same mystical qualities that made the Zep records timeless. My second favorite track is the last one ""Watching You"" Plant opened his show with this song. I was suprised by that but it was awesome. All of that massive percussion in the beginning balanced with the clean strumming acoustic. I love this song as it is one of the best displays of desperation. ""Should my darkness prevail, or does your memory fail"" ""Love on the wing carry my prayer cherish this moment in times of despair."" Another highlight was when the entire band picked up acoustic instruments (guitars and mandolins) and played Liars Dance followed by Going to California. I saw the Plant/Page show a few years later but it wasn't near as impressive. Anyway...good stuff."
3,An Okay Release,"Of the whole Robert Plant discography, Manic Nirvana in my opinion is the least impressive. The production and musicianship are fine; the songs just don't make much of a splash. Quite a few songs off this effort are just not too inspiring and don't break ground. The songs that are worth a listen are ""I Cried,"" and ""Tie Dye on the Highway."" The previous album Now and Zen was a bit better than this album. I really give this effort two and a half stars, but the rating system doesn't allow it. Shaken 'n' Stirred is a true challenge to listen to and is his best."
5,Keep Getting Better And Better,"Avalon has done it agian. This CD is great. They've taken all of their most encouraging and inspirational songs and put them together in one CD and, it also has 3 great new songs too! I strongly recommend this CD."
4,Definatly the Very Best,"This album is a very decent one with many popular pop songs that this group came out with. It's a good cd but I'm not really into pop, more rock but it was definatly worth the money I spent for it. If you love pop, buy this!"
3,A decent collection for the casual listener...,"Recently, I got this CD as a Christmas present from a friend of mine. While I'm not exactly a devoted fan of Avalon, I have heard some of their songs on Christian radio. To be honest, there's nothing special about the kind of music they do (typical Christian dance-pop). However, at the same time, this is NOT a bad collection. The music may be dance-pop; however, it is also uplifting and encouraging! Stand out tracks include ""Testify To Love"", ""Take You At Your Word"", and ""I Don't Want To Go"", and especially ""Everything To Me"". This is coming from a believer who listens to almost everything (from Enya to Metallica) except country and jazz. I wouldn't be surprised if I play this collection in my car and on my stereo from time to time! In case you're curious, I also listen to Christian alternative bands like The 77's, The Choir, and more recent bands like Living Sacrifice and Switchfoot!"
3,Testify to Love: The Very Best of Avalon,"Nobody can question the talent and inspirational singing of Avalon. I have all but one of their CD's. That is why I am disappointed with this release.If you have none of their previous CD's, I recommend this one. But if you are like me and have all of their CD's, it is disappointing to pay all of that money when you only get 2 new songs, and the rest of the songs are not even new releases of their old music - they only placed those old songs on the new CD.This was disappointing for me. The best contemporary group in the country, selling their old music on a new CD. That requires very little effort. Next CD, I hope that Avalon will sing 13 or 14 new songs, and not sell us their old songs that avid listeners already have.Bryan"
3,For the readers,"For the below reviewer, this is a Greatest Hits collection. They put old songs on a Greatest Hits collection. That's the whole point, to have a collection of their old songs. Perhaps you didn't read what you were buying when you bought it? Sheesh.Now, as for my review: This is a great thing to buy if you are a fan of ordinary vocal pop music. Some of their songs are catchy, some are not. I don't really appreciate vocal talent all that well, I mean they don't even play their own instruments. What kind of 'band' is that?"
4,Best of.. So Far,"I am not a huge fan of this type of music but this is a great collection of Songs. They all have very powerful lyrice and the vocals are so amazing. Even with a new editon to the group their is still nothing lacking. Standout tracks are ""The Glory"" ""Wonder Why"" ""Give It Up"" and ""I Dont Want To Go"" Also has a couple of new tracks and a Christmas song ""Dont Save It All For Christmas Day."" The latter off of their Christmas album. A great pop album that you can sing along to and very worshipful."
2,"Another ""me-too"" fragrance that's unoriginal","Estee Lauder did not have a gourmand/foody fragrance in their lineup during the Flowerbomb/Angel/Pink Sugar trend, so in order to meet the ""me too"" rush, they quickly slapped together this generic fruity gourmand that wants to be unique and distinctive, but it's about 15 years too late. It's a harried, boring composition that wishes it were as delicately delicious as Hanae Mori Butterfly or Dior Hypnotic Poison but fails to come close to either; trying to please everyone by being mediocre.It is a highly forgettable gourmand/floriental that does not linger in one's memory nor draw comments the way an Angel or Flowerbomb would. If you want to be special, buy an *original* fruity gourmand (i.e. Lolita Lempicka, Coco Mademoiselle, Hanae Mori). If you want to be ""me too"", then get Pleasures Delight."
5,Parfum,"Any of these perfumes make momma very happy. As it goes ""Momma aint happy-No one is happy! Merry Christmas to all!"
2,Going downhill ...,"Am I still reading about Doom? Is this still about the game's storyline?Doesn't seem like it. As you progress through, the author seems to drift further and further away from what iD wanted Doom to be all about. This would be perfectly OK if the sci-fi plot was better.If you want to remain with the story that the videogame sketched, you shouldn't read this book, you should stop at volume two. If you're curious what the author has to offer, I guess you could keep reading.I didn't rate this book like so because it's drifting away from the original storyline, I gave it this rating because I didn't think it's that great of a scifi book, plain and simple."
2,Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.,"This book loses all the first two had to offer, and fills the void with...nothing. It isn't funny, or scary, or has meaningful violence...it's just a filler to set the stage for book 4. The only reason this book gets 2 stars is because it is closely tied to the rest of the Doom Series. If you are looking to get the whole series, get this book, but if you are just looking for good novels, stick with Knee Deep in the Dead and Endgame."
1,I would like to buy this book!,"My son has books 1, 2, and 4. It would be fantastic if the publisher could get it together and print more of book 3 so children who have started reading the series, can finish reading all of the books."
3,"Good, But Not Great","After I read the first 2 outstanding books in the Doom series, I was expecting another great book by Dafydd ab Hugh. The book had alot things in it that could have been alot better. Still, the book is okay. Pretty much your average book."
3,"Good, but not great...","This book is kind of good, but it takes a long while to start up. It feels like a link between book 2 and 4, rather than a novel. It also strays from the plot of the first two books, and has inconsistances which are obvious if you pay attention. Not as good as the first 2, but worth a shot."
1,"1,2,&4",I have come to the conclusion that #3 is impossible to get. I wish the publishers would print more. The temptation was to much and i went and read #4. That was good in sertain parts.
2,This Is Supposed to be DOOM?,"The third in the series of DOOM novels, this one is, by my standards, the worst. It's very slow, doesn't have much action, and really has nothing to do with DOOM. I wouldn't suggest you read this book, but, if you've read the second and third novels in the series, and you want to know what happens next, you might as well read it to get you up to speed for when you read #4. Otherwise, check out book #1 or #2 instead. That's my two cents."
3,Not as strong,"Some of the great John Williams themes from the other Harry Potter movies can be found in this track. However, overall I felt this track didn't strengthen the movie quite as much. In particular, there's no memorable tracks for the spiders or basilisk. Every great monster should have its own musical theme, but those parts are largely silent or just retreads. I'd recommend getting one of the other Potter soundtracks, unless you're a diehard Potter fan."
2,Not the best textbook,"This is not the best textbook to start you off in Power Electronics. It is OK as a reference book. I prefer much more ""Power Electronics: Converters, Applications and Design"", Mohan, Undeland and Robbins, Wiley"", and wish that my profesor used that one in his class."
4,It's.... GOOD.,Plain and simple this was much less expensive than what they quoted ($50) me at Guitar Center and it's the real deal. I would have given 5 stars but would have preferred a longer cord. No big deal. Buy it!
1,HEAVY DUTY ARE TOO BIG FOR OUR CASE!!!,"Just bought my hubby a new acrylic holder for xmas. Ordered new trays and decided to get the heavy duty ones since I wanted to get him the best of the best. Well, the new holders arrived -- and while they are very heavy duty, but they are also 9-1/2"" long -- almost 1/2"" too long for either carrier. I called the company and it turns out the light weight ones are 8-1/4"" long. They really need to make this clarification on the product description and they don't. Check the size of your carrier BEFORE you purchase!!!!"
3,Worth it just for 'Sole Survivor'...,"Yeah, it's an audience recording. Yes, it's two discs. But this really is a treat if you can find it cheap or used. Because no one...not Asia, not Wetton solo...nobody...has ever pulled off a better recording of ""Sole Survivor"" than the one that is contained on Live In Koln. Aziz Ibrahim's guitar screams and whines, Michael Sturgis' drum fills blow away any enemy in sight, Downes' keyboards are on fire, and Payne, coupled with a rowdy and wild German audience, are dark, painful, angry bearers of the song's mantra. ""...Just keep on burning, right to the end."" Keyboard/acoustic versions of ""Summer"" and ""Sad Situation"" are good too."
2,Ugh... again!,"Well, not learning my lesson after buying ""Live in Osaka,"" I payed good money and put it in thinking that they'd learned their lesson about audience recordings... Nope! As with ""Live In Osaka"" the performances are well done and it has a nice offering from my favorite Asia album, Aria... the sound is wee bit better than ""Live In Osaka,"" but other than that, this one is also for collectors only..."
4,A FITTING TRIBUTE TO MOOSE CHARLAP,"HAVING BEEN ONE OF THE VERY FEW WHO SAW ""KELLY"" in 1965,I WAS VERY PLEASED TO FIND THIS STUDIO RECORDING OF THE ORIGINAL MUSIC. I DO MEAN ORIGINAL. SOME OF THE SONGS THAT WERE WRITTEN WERE LATER REMOVED BY A GROUP OF PANIKY PRODUCERS PRIOR TO THE NEW YORK OPENING. THEIR ACTIONS RESULTED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOW THAN HAD BEEN ENVISIONED BY THE COMPOSERS. IT ALSO MADE ""KELLY"" A MONUMENTAL FLOP SO MUCH SO THAT ITS DEMISE WAS THE SUBJECT OF A COVER STORY IN ""SATURDAY EVENING POST"". IF YOU READ THE CD NOTES..IT IS ALL EXPLAINED THERE. THE CD IS DEDICATED TO MOOSE CHARLAP. THE PERFORMERS ARE FIRST RATE, INCLUDING BRIAN D'ARCY JAMES (TITANIC) AND RIGHT OUT OF THE 60'S, SANDY STEWART. IT MAY HAVE SOME SHORTCOMINGS, BUT OVERALL..EDDIE LAWRENCE SCORED WITH THIS CD!"
2,Kelly Hops Again!,"Compared to the ""original"" cast album, which was the two writers and a piano, this album is a dream. Still, it would have been great to hear the original orchestrations instead of a studio band. The performances on this CD give the show some credibility, unlike the first album. One wants to see more of this type of thing done. But put in the original orchestrations. How about Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Yearling, La Strada? If you are a serious collector nab this while you can."
1,Makes the JFK assassination BORING!,"If you have a serious interest in the JFK assassination then DO NOT buy this movie. If you're someone who loved Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" movie and has seen it 20X then DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. The producer is using the JFK assassination premise to lure you in and aside from the scenes in Dealy Plaza the movie goes nowhere. This is the most BORING film that I've ever seen associated with JFK's murder. I wouldn't have thought that could be possible. The movie doesn't even shed any fictitous light on the case and it's very unrealistic. Go rent or buy Executive Action for a clever, fictional depiction of what might have happened in Dallas forty years ago. I'll repeat, DO NOT get sucked in by the JFK assassination premise. If you do, like I did, you'll be disappointed two hours later. What a waste of $22."
1,A movie for idiots!,"Only a total moron would believe that this is a genuine interview. Anyone who believes that Oswald was just an innocent ""patsy"" lacks common sense, or is totally ignorant of the FACTS regarding the JFK shooting."
4,"implausible and flawed, but interesting nonetheless","it's implausible that the second gunman (if there was one) would have been allowed to live. 'they' would have killed him just as they killed oswald. it would've been too dangerous to do otherwise. what happened in this film proves the point. so a so-called story of the assassin really is pure fiction, even if there was a conspiracy to kill jfk. the film itself is also a little flawed. even after the marine co died (or was killed), there was still the would-be assassin's shooting buddy who could have corroborated the claims. he didn't have to attempt to kill the pres to prove his point.still, an interesting film. worth a rental, at least."
3,Chilling Conspiracy Theory Tale is a Winner,"This is a terrific little one gag thriller, the central conceit being that an out of work camerman lives next door to the real assassin who shot JFK and now wants his 15 minutes. This slight idea is milked for maximum effect by director Burger and his cast.Raymond J Barry is the real reason to see this movie. His steely, quitely spoken malevolence makes him one seriously scary and disturbed character-your in no doubt he's capable of taking down a President.Barry's been doing stirling work in supporting roles for years. His other memorable bad guy is in the otherwise woeful 'The Chamber'-he's truly chilling as the unrepentant white supremacist. He also made a strong impression as Robert Duvall's boss in 'Falling Down'.Highly recommended."
3,The second shooter?,"Honestly, I think I'm still a bit confused after seeing this movie. Reading the ""Extras"" helped a bit but I'm still not sure what to think of it.Almost forty years after the John F. Kennedy assassination, an ex-Marine named Walter Ohlinger comes forward with a startling claim. He was the shooter on the grassy knoll. I'm really into conspiracy theories but this one seemed a bit kooky and hard to believe. The acting by the ex-marine was superb! It's not a movie I'd rush out to rent again, but I'm glad I did see it."
4,Different & Gritty,You have not seen this before. A pseudo-documentary hooks you and drags you where you doubted you could be taken. Well done. You'll go research Raymond J. Barry
2,Pretty disappointing,"This new album of Frankie is a big disappointment - the songs may seem attractive at first, but don't wear well all. I am not a big fan of the arrangements of Sergio George, so that may be the problem for me.Frankie Negron has a voice which rises to the occasion. When the material is good, he is quite fine, otherwise, his singing sounds as strained and awkward as the material.The best album by far of Frankie is Lo que Llevo por Dentro, which includes some terrific arrangements by Ramon Sanchez."
5,nice songs,"another favourite brilliant songs . i really enjoy his music cannot fault this cd. or any of his songs ,"
4,A Must See!,"This movie is a must see for anyone who eats. I didn't like the layout as much as I did Food,inc, but it was still very informative. If you are not interested in watching this more in depth film, then watch Food, inc, but this one was worth a look, too."
5,MUST see,You must see this movie. It explains where your food comes from and the dangers of Monsanto's monopoly of our food.
3,Informative,"This was a very informative documentary, though perhaps not one of the most engaging to watch. There are a number of brilliant books about Monsanto on the market, and I recommend them as a better alternative. But if you really want your information in video form, this is a good starting point."
4,Great CD..,The CD is pretty good in my opinion. Bought it for only maybe two songs but started listening to the rest.
2,Cultural bias?,"While this book does provide the critical reader with a good overview and new understanding of differences and similarities between Mexican/other Multicultural groups to European groups, it does have two major problems.First, the author himself, and his father, are both two of the biggest pioneers in Chicano Psychology. While their names would probably appear more than others in nearly any book dealing with this subject manner, the way in which the author expands on his own research while briefly summarizing that of other psychologists.In addition, this book address the concern of culture-centric practices on other cultures. This is a very important idea and is, as it should be, a major theme of the book. However, it seems somewhat hypocritical that Ramirez often approaches all European based techniques as being wrong."
3,high energy 90's midwestern emo,"This album sounds pretty much like what you'd expect from former boy's life singer and the drummer from giant's chair. Its definitely more straight-forward than either Boy's Life or Giant's Chair. Brandon Butler's strained vocal style fits well with this slightly more conventional, melodic rock sound on this album. Even his occasional yelling fits the songs well. I really like the guitar tone here too. If you wondered what Departures and Landfalls would sound like under traditional recording techniques, this is as close so you can get."
4,A Must For People Who Appreciate Music,"A most excellent example of their work. Well worth listening to, especially track 6, ""closer than i"", a very moving song with great vocals by Steve Jansen. They just keep getting better!"
5,Lovely,"Lovely and soothing music. Even if not a Classicallover, think you might enjoy this one evening or moreplaying in the background at dinner or with a glass ofwine."
4,Very Good,"Excellent job, It is another kind of sound, deep, hard, and veryinteresting, Mike's voice 10/10."
3,"Not terrible, but NOT their best","By this album, Loudness had (sadly) parted ways with original singer Minoru Niihara, making this one with Metal Church singer Mike Vescera. The net result is a Japanese band with an attempt at an an American accent. What it really means is, the band wanted to remake their original American album, Thunder in the East.Vescera does bear a (very!) distant sonic resemblance to Niihara, but with less charm and more pierciing screams. The band is still great, as always, but the vocals don't really... well,... ""fit right"". It would be like, say, Rob Halford singing in Dokken.Sadly, by this point America was losing interest in this great band. I'm glad that the original lineup is back together and ready to blow the roofs off clubs all over-- but this album sank the band's career in AQmerica."
5,EXCELLENT MELODIC HARD ROCK,"The music on this CD ranks among the best in well-crafted and deftly-executed rock, without sacrificing artistic passion: clean, powerful, melodic, evocative and haunting, it's reminiscent of prime Dokken. There are no sleeper cuts on this release--each song stands on its own as a sonic tour-de-force."
3,Akira's guitars survive the westernization of Mike V.,"probably my least favorite of the Loudness albums, i felt that Mike V's influence on the band's style lessend the overall quality."
1,Another one...,"LOUDNESS was another sad case of a great and creative metal band trying desperately to change their sound to gain some new markets, mainly in the U.S.A. THe result, once again a normal one, was catastrophic: the musicians started to dress like glam bands; the drums started to sound like electronic machines; the lyurics began to talk about love and more love.... THis CD is one of LOUDNESS worst efforts ever."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,"VERY POOR OFFERING FROM A GREAT BAND. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS CD ...I RUSHED HOME WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS, ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED GREATLY. .MIKE VESCERA(MALMSTEEN) IS THE NEW SINGER AND NOT THE BEST AT HIS CRAFT. I WANT TO LIKE THIS CD BUT I JUST CANT. IT LACKS ENERGY AND THE SOLO'S ARE SUB-PAR. THIS IS THE LAST RECORDING WITH TWO OF THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS: MASAYOSHI YAMASHITA AND MUNETEKA HIGUCHI. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY LEFT."
1,Poser lead singer,I bought this album way back when. I didnt know there was a lead singer change. Well I hated this Poser. The music may have been great but he spoiled it for me.
3,Not A Disappointment,"I bought this release a few years ago, and must say that I was never really disappointed. I do admit, Loudness sounded a little different though with the loss of their original leadsinger. That guy had a voice all his own, and injected a lot of originality vocally to their music. The new singer on this album is not bad though. He does a great job singing on some of the album's best songs: ""Lost Without Your Love,"" ""Danger of Love,"" and ""25 Days."" I've always had a lot of respect for Akira Takasaki's guitar playing. Sounds a bit different from previous releases, but in no way a disappointment. Worth a listen."
5,Schumann in Full Flower,"Sauer is considered by many the finest Liszt pupil to have left recordings. His style was caricatured by Claudio Arrau in conversations with Joseph Horowitz. Arrau dismissed Sauer as a salon player, a darling of frivolous Vienna. But Josef Hofmann (also disparaged by Arrau) gave a truer estimate, calling Sauer ""a truly great virtuoso."" Although Sauer downplayed his association with Liszt, we hear on this disc of live performances -- even more than in his commercial recordings released by Marston -- Lisztian breadth and nobility, and also the refusal to take oneself too seriously, the hallmark of a gentleman. Sauer preferred Anton Rubinstein to Clara Schumann, and when listening to Sauer -- still at his best so late in life -- one suspects that Robert Schumann might have agreed. A must for all music lovers."
2,Terrible,This album may be the worst album Judas Priest have ever released. Its so terrible that there is not any good song so you can say its just ok. Sorry guys but this album is only for collectors. I really wonder how some guys like this album. They are probably very fanatic fans (means whatever Judas Priset releash they are gonna like it). It reminds me of Metallica -> there are guys that they like St anger (if you believe this). IF you are new to Judas Priest try Painkiller and some previous works like Sad wings of Destiny - British steel and Defenders of the faith.
2,First you have to get it open!,"I have not been able to even try out this pooduct because no one can get the battery door open. Bedsides myself, five other adults have tried and cannot get the door to the battery compartment open. This is necessary, according to the instructions, to use the radio. Maybe we should try a kid? Anyway, if we cannot fix this defect, then we must reject!"
2,Very disappointed with this product,"I got this model from Radio Shack. The first one was defective--the FM band indicator was off by 5 MHz or so, and the TV bands didn't work. The replacement model I was given is also defective--again, the TV bands don't work. Also, the cell phone charger only charges while you crank the crank--no battery power stored will charge your phone, a serious defect. In an emergency, you could call if you continuously cranked during your call, but there is no spring like some other crank radios, which effectively store your cranking for long periods of time. A big disappointment, both in quality and features."
4,TV Reception will be useless once the HDTV switchover happens (Feb 09),"Be aware...When the mandatory NTSC to HDTV switchover happens in Feb '09, the TV reception on this radio (and any other radio with TV reception) will cease to function. (AM/FM/NOAA reception will not be effected.)"
2,Arrived broken and incomplete,"We know that this is one of the best radio's for emergencies. Being up north with our snow and ice storms, we need a good reliable radio. But this radio, though one of the best, arrived at our home broken due to some cheap...cheap plastic parts. You also have to send off for your cell phone attachment and if you have more than one type of cell phone in the home, you're out of luck."
4,Pretty Good Unit - Good Set of Features,"Overall I'm pleased with the unit and believe it will be handy indeed come a power outage. A few issues (beyond the basic feature set tradeoff designed into the unit) I've experienced with 2 separate units tested:1. Cellphone charger doesn't seem to work.2. FM reception (contrary to what I've read in other reviews of this product) is actually pretty decent - but not great.3. Battery door is VERY hard to open the first time and then doesn't close very tightly thereafter.4. The light can accidentally be left on when the unit is slipped into the carrying case.Again, overall this is a nice unit (and I love the siren!)"
4,Good... could be a little bit better though.,"All handles and switches are made of plastic and they don't seem very sturdy. The flashlight Leds are not powerful. The display should be illuminated. Anyway, I've got two of these radios (one for home, the other for the office) and I like them, they work well."
1,Eton Red Cross Emergency Radio,"This radio is poorly built. When you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out. You put them back in, carefully set it down, then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again...Now, I put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place....stay away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands...good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review...Bruce Payne"
2,Save your money,"Living in a hurricane prone area I thought this might be a good investment. I received it today and am very disapointed. It reminds me of something I could have ordered out of a comic book as a kid. My first impresstion is it's light weight,poorly made,very bad sound and doesn't receive stations very well.Maybe in a storm I'll be glad I bought it ,but I doubt it. Hope I don't have to find out!"
2,Poor Design,"Overall I'm unimpressed with the radio. Despite it being water resistant, the unit cannot be exposed to rain or moisture...(??). The battery cover is flimsy and does not close well leaving gaps for moisture to get in (so much for being water-resistant).The controls are poorly aligned and placed. The OFF selection for the radio and light are located in the middle of the dial selection and are misaligned so that it's unintuitive how to turn them off. Moreover when you try and put the radio into its tiny carrying sack with not much room, invariably one of the knobs is pushed and the light or radio goes on...Radio reception is good. I just hope that if you're in an emergency situation, it's a dry one..."
3,cell phone adapter problems,"I received this radio in early May and asked for a particular cell phone adapter.After almost 2 months without hearing from them I contacted Eton and they said they didn't have it in stock and it would take 2 or 3 months to get it. They could have notified me earlier, their customer service is not impressive. I wonder if I'll ever get it? I would suggest that before you buy this radio, check with Eton and make sure they can supply the adapter."
2,Poor Customer Service,"I bought a smaller Eton/Red Cross emergency radio/light. The unit came with a postcard to mail away for an adapter to fit your cell phone, so you can charge it in an emergency using the hand crank or solor panel. Weeks went by, nothing... Months went by, nothing.... Repeated calls (always got an answering machine), left details.... nothing. I am still waiting. I will say the unit works well, but I purchased it mainly for the cell phone charger, and without their custom phone ""power tip"" you're up the creek."
4,does not include cell phone adapters,"I returned the first one because it did not have the cell phone adapters, I received the replacement the very next day, but it also did not include the cell phone adapters"
1,Rubber end deteriorates,"I bought this item about five years ago. It functioned well enough but not that well. Recently, in view ofhurricane Isaac (August, 2012), I pulled it out of storage and found that the rubber bumpers at each end haddeteriorated so badly that it was very tacky and came off on my hand when I picked up the unit. I bought itthrough L.L. Bean. I will not buy another product by Eton, but will seek another manufacturer."
1,Amazon prices are not cheap,"This product can be bought for the same price if not less at other online retailers. Amazon makes it look like it has been ""marked down"" but in reality it hasn't! Buyers beware."
2,Recharge your cell phones?,"The primary reason I bought this product was because, in addition to all the normal emergency features, it advertised a built in cell phone charger. Well, if you happen to own one the selected brands and models for which they provide adapters, you can. Once you receive the product, the fine print on the box tells you that not all cell phone manufacturers and models are supported. I don't own any of those they support. So I am very dissappointed about that."
1,Poor Design for an Emergency Necessity,"I will not be sending this item to my frail 85-year old mother in law to help her survive in hurricane alley on the west coast of Florida. It is virtually impossible to open the battery case cover to assemble the rechargeable battery connection for this radio. Most folks would buy this and store it until needed and so would not know in advance that they cannot access the battery compartment. This is unacceptable design failure for something the Red Cross is touting as a household essential.When the company was contacted for assistance, they suggested inserting a butter knife in the hinge and forcing the cover open!! Folks have already reported being injured in trying to force the cover open.I will be returning this one as soon as I can."
2,Red Cross radio,less than expected. The first one came with a broken latch for the battery compartment and I had to go through the exchange hassle. Reception is not that good and the T.V. mode of reception is very weak. Will keep it but disappointed.
3,TV reception? Not after 2/16/09!,"If you're buying this radio for emergency preparedness and expect to use the TV feature then you should also expect a disaster in the next 2 years. That's because after Feb 16, 2009, all analog TV transmitters will be shut off and the TV tuner in this will be worthless. You can thank your friends at the FCC for this great idea"
4,Emergency Radio,"Bought this to keep around in case the power goes out - have had it for a few months now and check it every so often - its been reliable so far. It is compact and has lots of features including a windup cell phone charger - only issue was you had to order the adapter for your phone and it took 2 months to come, but it was free."
2,Power cable problems,"Thankfully I haven't had cause to try out its emergency capabilities, but since I needed a radio for the kitchen I thought this would kill two birds with one stone. After a few weeks I managed to snap the aerial off - partly my fault but I would have hoped that wouldn't be so easy to do. And now about a year on, the power connector fits so poorly that I can't power it from an electrical outlet any more. It'll just have to be stored away in case of dire need and I'll get something sturdier and cheaper for everyday use."
2,Only Fair,The radio came with a storage bag but it is not large enough to accomodate the AC adapter.Reception and clarity of the radio speaker is not great.
4,Excellent!,"Excellent product! Has everything I need. The only negative was that I couldn't pick-up ALL the local TV stations, but that's probably my location. Wish I had it during last month's power outage. I'm ready for the next time."
5,Great thing to have around,I was very impressed by this radio. Great functionality and a really good combination of features. Haven't used the cell phone charger but that's a plus. One of those things that you hope you never need but good to have around. I highly recommend it.
4,"Excellent, but SHORT","I like almost all of Donnie McClurkin's music and I really liked the ""Again"" CD. The DVD was really good, but the only bad thing about it is that it is very short. Make sure you look at how long it is before you buy the DVD. I'm not saying it is too too short, but maybe for some people it is. (Buy his later DVD ""Psalms, Hymns, Spiritual Songs"")"
2,no sound,"this product was not what i expected, but was assisted with my less than perfect product. every effort was made to satisfy my slight disappointment, and i want to thank amazon for their assiantance. thank you."
5,I got it for my birthday!,This is an awesome DVD. It is a must buy for true Gospel lovers. I didn't buy it because it was given to me as a birthday present.Donnie Mcclurkin Again
1,I'd Give It - 0 Stars...,"I'd give it - 0 Stars, but that option was not available.This disc is LAME, and so are the band members which I had the misfortune of meeting once.PS Fred, you are not funny, but then again, neither is SNL ever since Chris Farley left the show. Get over yourself."
4,OH GOD!!,"Two words- SUSAN BLAKELY!! Watching her blood red nails dig into her lovers back is so salivating, it makes this tired flick palatable. A gangster's wife (Blakely) is frightened to learn that her steamy affair has been photographed, making her the object of blackmail. Forget the plot. Watch Susan Blakely seduce every man in the world."
3,Not have it Yet,I haven't gottin this toy yet so i'm just sayin the should have made a Original Ultimate Kevin without the pumping heart feature.
4,Good But beware!,"After reading all the great reviews about Callanetics, I jumped on the band wagon and purchased Callanetics and Quick Callanetics-Stomach. Assuming that the Stomach video would be different and a little more focused. The stomach workouts on both tapes were exactly the same. To my dismay I cannot return the Quick Callanetics, so just be aware! You can purchase the 60 minute video and have the exact same workout plus you can have all your other areas of focus as well-thighs, buns, arms etc..."
1,nothing new,"Callanetics is wonderful, but I expected something more out of this video than the exact same exercises that are in the full video. As a matter of fact, the arms and abs section is right in the begining of the full video. Skip the quick series and just buy the video."
5,LOVED IT,"Stephen Dorff is amazing in this movie. Totally hot. Besides reminding me a bit of a cross between myself and my best friend he just ate up the screen. Poor Reese. Well, at least I can say I've seen a movie with her in it. Sorry I didn't win the big powerball jackpot or I'd be hiring him for a private event. My boss might read this post but S.F.W."
1,"What a loser. Can he die now, please?","This delusional right wing loon hates just about everybody, including foreigners. Why do people like Nugent exist? We're living in a liberal world, and people like this goon should leave the planet now. Besides, the music here sucks.On a side note, Beyonce's fantastic ""B'Day"" comes out September 5."
1,chicago: music from the Hit Stage Play and Movie,"junk! just gave my 16 yr old daughter for valentine's day and she cried when she played it! The ad listed all the actor's that she loved to ""mimic."" I will never trust or buy anything used through Amazon again. THIS is a horrible CD! and shame on Amazon for sponsoring such a sham!"
3,Season 1 ? But missing the first two episodes?,"My kids have gotten into Ninjago so I wanted something for those long car rides. While they've likely seen all of the episodes on cable, I picked this up figuring I could watch with them as well on those long car rides (my wife likes to drive).I put in the DVD this morning and the first episode was all four ninjas together. I had remembered some flashes of Kai with his sister before they met Sensei Wu but that wasn't the first episode. I checked wikipedia and, sure enough, there are two other episodes prior to the first one on this disk set (it's two disks). Wikipedia calls the episodes on this disk Season 2... So, if you're interested in the origins of Ninjago, you're going to have to watch those some other way."
1,Way to much evil in this movie,"When I was a kid, Good always won over Evil. Now I'm not so sure which power is emphasized more..."
1,Too Addictive,My kids are way to obssessed. They watched all the episodes during a marathon and never stopped talking about it. They never miss an episode and I am concerned. My kids are begging me to buy the dvd of episodes they have already seen multible times.
5,im sick of it...,But my boys cant get enough! I'm just glad it tries to teach some life lessons. And isn't all just fighting and violence. There is too much of that these days!
5,The whole family loves it!,"We watch Ninjago on Cartoon Network and we all love it. We were not able to see the episodes in season 1 so I downloaded it on my kindle fire and watched. It is great treat for the kids when they can sit and watch it. The whole family loves Ninjago. The kids have some of the Lego pieces and copy the show while playing - it is cute to see the 3 year old singing the theme song and spinning the spinners (or him self) saying ""Ninjagoooooooo"". Very cute to watch and enjoy."
1,"Seriously? Who wants to teach their children to call women ""Hot""?","I have to admit my kids loved the first episode which is all I allowed them to watch. Most of it was okay, but there was one part where one of the characters is talking about rescuing his sister and his friend says, ""Is she hot?"" Seriously? Not the kind of values I want to teach my sons."
1,Disappointed,I thought I was buying a different season from the one I bought in the shops in Australia (which was marked Season 2!) and it turned out to be the exact same story. Something is a bit wrong with the system when Season 1 in the States in season 2 in Australia?? My son who was eagerly awaiting his new Ninjago DVD was very disappointed to find out it was the same as the one he already had.Is there a whole season of the Boneheads (skeleton characters) or just the one 45min episode with the Boneheads and Lord Garmodon??
5,Just wonderful!,My 6 yr old loves it. Comes with two dvds and a total of 13 episodes! MUST HAVE FOR A NINJAGO FAN.
5,The Boys LOVE This DVD!,"This DVD set contains all the episodes of Ninjago Season 1. My 5 and 6-year-old sons are glued. They can't get enough. It's action-packed, but ""clean;"" no blood, no realistic violence, no bad language... all the things that all-too-often plague boys' ""entertainment"" these days. There are good messages of teamwork and doing good, too. There is no rooting for the bad guys here. I highly recommend this DVD for those with little guys. I've pre-ordered Season 2 already. :)"
2,Great for 10 year olds,My 10 year old loves it. I think the series is just a load of junk with thin plot lines and even thinner dialogue.
5,Great LEGO series,"My sons (ages 6 and 2) can't get enough of Ninjago! This series has become a staple in our home. Engaging characters, fun action sequences and (mostly) appropriate content for younger viewers. If your children like ninjas, this is a great series to have in your video collection."

3,"Good, but get ""Perfecto Presents"" first","It is good, but the 2 disc ""Perfecto Presents"" is better. Both releases have a fantastic Sarah MacLachlan remix, but overall disc 2 of ""Presents"" is much stronger, especially if you're looking for more of a club vibe."
5,The most complete voyage into trance and techno yet!,"This CD is a basic to trance and techno lovers , It mixes Paul's great style with the latest sounds of today's hit DJ's around the world. Paul Oakenfold makes this CD a non-stop , high-energy ride through the sounds of trance. Not only is this CD a guaranteed licence-loser if played in a car , but a guaranteed thrill ride ."
4,Did you buy this yet.....,"An excellent mix by Paul Oakenfold, what else can you expect from him. Some great tracks here like some of my personal 2001 favourites like Flesh and Silence. These are really good songs but if you like me already have Another World then this might not be too good of an investment. All in all a very good mix."
4,Thank God for Paul Oakenfold,"I first got into trance through Paul Oakenfold and have enjoyed all of the CD's he has put out. I have since listened to other DJ's, some of which at times provide the satisfaction Oakey does...Sasha&Digweed, Deep Dish, Nick Warren, etc. But the bottom line is Oakey is still the best. He just has a better grasp of how to put together a listenable, melodic, and just plain cool set of tracks.This two CD set has some of the same tracks as Perfecto Presents...but it is worth getting this set just for the 2nd CD which has some of his best stuff. Unfortunately side 1 is marred by the painfully recurring Bullet in a Gun track...maybe he'll finally put this one to rest."
2,Travelling through commercial songs instedad of originality!,"I must say that when i bought this album i thought it was going to be one of my favorites. I adore ""Another World"" the mixing was great and the selection of songs one of a kind typical of a king of trance. Travelling disapponited me very much. For a man that started the whole movement of raves and techno music, he has become so commercial and simple nothing new, nothing enticing. The mixing is good, of course he is a great DJ after all but the music does not give you the vibes and the feeling that other albums give you, like Digweed LA or the sort. At the end of the album i was wondering if it was really Oakenfold maybe he hire someone to chose the traks I do not know but I really think he has so much potential and this particular album does not give him the credit he deserves."
3,"A Solid, Yet Uninspired, Mix","After listening to ""Another World,"" I was looking forward to giving ""Travelling"" a go. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the mixes are great. The problem is that it's basically ""Another World 2.0."" A good majority of the tunes in this mix already appear in ""Another World,"" so if you've heard the aforementioned album, you'll notice this album seems to amount to little more than a track realignment.To future buyers, it pretty much comes down to choosing either this album or ""Another World,"" but I wouldn't recommend owning both."
2,Uninspiring,"Lots of these reviews talk about Paul Oakenfold doing something special or something uninspiring on this album but I wouldn't be surprised if Paul doesn't mix these albums at all, rather having an engineer do it in a piece of software called ProTools. I don't want to come off as some sort of electronic-music snob--I thought Paul Oakenfold was the greatest at a point, too--but there're a lot of better trance albums out there, both in track selection and mixing. Without delving into any sort of underground, you can pick up Paul van Dyk's ""The Politics of Dancing"" and be much happier. Or, if you insist on something that sounds like Paul Oakenfold, save yourself ten dollars and buy the latest ""Ultimate Trance"" CD."
2,"""greatest hits""?","I was pretty disappointed with this disc. Although Oakenfold is an undisputed master of electronic music, this collection felt like it was produced on auto-pilot. If you have any other Oakenfold mixes, you are sure to already have many of these tracks. If you're new to electronic music, this might be a nice intro. But if you've got much of it already, you will probably find you've heard this all before, and in much more inspiring ways."
4,"'Travellng' into 'Another World""","I have both Travelling and Another World. I would have to say that Travelling is the deeper mix of the two. Although their are 6-7 tracks from Another World on Travelling, Oaky doesn't disappoint!This is beyond Another World. This is just straight trance, banging, swinging, and just a big mind trip!! My favorite tracks on here are the progressive Oliver Lieb remix of the Utah Saints track and of course the Floor.i.da cyber freaks Rabbit in the Moon's remix of Planet Perfecto's 2000 version of ""Bullet in a Gun"".So, if you don't like Another World, get this one. You will truly be amazed at this great mix from a great DJ!"
3,True Oakenfold Fans of Old Should Like This,If the type of sets that Paul Oakenfold used to mix at the turn of the century still appeal to your auditory senses then this may be an album for you. Travelling is a two disc set loaded with tracks that are very reminiscent of Oakenfold's glory years. Expertly mixed and true to his preference for trance. Both discs have a very similar sound throughout although disc 1 has a little more of a darker undertone while disc 2 has a few more clubbers' anthems.Disc 1 gets 3.5/5 stars and disc 2 gets 3/5 stars.

3,Did not work for my baby.,"When my daughter came home from the hospital she really liked this nipple shape. She was a very picky baby. Although, she liked these nipples, they gave her VERY bad gas. We had to finally get her to switch to Dr. Browns bottles. These may or may not work for your baby. The one major plus for this item is that they are very inexpensive compared to other brands."
3,"good, but too small","I like the larger version of these. These ones are tiny, which I seem to be finding on many gerber products lately. So my daughter doesn't like them as well."
4,Great Nipples,"This was the only nipple my breastfed son would use. We tried a range of bottles - Dr.Brown's, Avent, ect. These were all great bottles but he refused them until we found these - the cheapest bottles out there! He latched on immediately and never had another problem. We have been using them for over a year now."
3,oily initially. and a bit slow,"You definitely would want to wash them thoroughly before first use as they are somehow very oily. Then they seem to be slower than the other type of nipples we were using - Playtex ventaire silicon, rapid. And you can't put them into a dish washer or a microwave sterilizer, so somewhat inconvenient."
1,Para Ti Mi Historia cd,"Sorry to say never recevied CD, was looking foward in receiving it, it was a present for one of my friends."
3,"A POOR MAN'S ""MOCKINGBIRD""","This would have been a fine book if Baldacci had not chosen to take Harper Lee head on. Lee apparently had only one book in her, but it was one of the greatest in the English language. The prolific Mr. Baldacci gets a little too closely in her face for comfort--a Depression-era story set in the South with a young female protagonist, a nobler-than-thou lawyer, a loyal sibling, a colorful sidekick, an evil redneck. . .he's just asking for the comparison, and his work, though well written and worth a read, just doesn't stack up."
4,It took awhile!,I selected a 4 star rating only because it took me longer to get into the plot. Typically a David Baldacci read is engaging from the first page so therefor I was surprised at the pace of this one. But once I connected (about half way through the book) I really cared what happened to the characters and I was absolutely thrilled with the ending!
2,Not for me...,I'm a big fan of David Baldacci's suspense stories. This one is not quite Baldacci material that I'm used to.
3,Agree with the Booklist review,"This book took me a long time to get through. Eventually the story of Oz and Lou in the hills of Virginia drew me in, but the writing style is pretty cliched. The characters are either good or evil, no in between. I could practically see the halo around Louisa Mae's head and the devil's pitchfork in George Davis' hand. Maybe this is why I don't usually read suspense novels, Baldacci's usual genre."
2,I wanted to like it...,"A friend recommended this book to me, knowing that I love to read books that evoke nostalgic feelings and that I absolutely love the Appalachian area. Unfortunately, this book, though I tried to love it, was not as good as I wished it would have been.The story is formulaic, with plot twists a reader knows are coming long before they do. I knew what the ending would be long before I got to it. And the reviewer who likened Jimmy to Huckleberry Finn without as much humor took the words right out of my mouth.If you want to read a book about Appalachia that will truly move you, read ""Christy"" by Catherine Marshall."
2,Don't Bother - He leaves you hanging,"I am so mad right now that I took the time to read that book. I was waiting to find out about the outcome of the children of one of the ""villians"" so to speak. He never mentioned what happened to them at the end. I felt so bad for those children who were beat and Never fed, I cried at least 5 times in the book. What happened with the court money? How and where did the mom and Cotton live??? Who did Lou marry? I wish I could write to David and tell him, please don't ever end a story WITHOUT a happy ending to the characters that one comes to feel for. He left too many open issues. I won't read him again!"
2,very disappointing,"I was expecting something on the lines of his absolute power. But it certainly dissappoints as there is no plot at all.it is the story of a girl who moves from newyork to a downtown area, and how her life changes and how she adapts to it.a very diappointing book from a great writer"
2,Sweet images but little depth,"Baldacci's intentions were good, and being a native of Southwest Virginia, I can relate to his emotion about his homeplace and his need to write nostalgically about it. However, the book is overly sentimental, entirely predictable, and thin. In his departure from thrillers to attempt more substantive material, I believe Baldacci over-extended himself with Wish You Well."
5,A look at the Virginia Mountains,"Baldacci has changed his writing style for ""Wish you Well"". I must say that I purchased the book with doubt. I have read every book that he has written, and reading what this one was about, I thought it would be boring and dull. His published works have had mystery and violence, but never giving a clue to the answers until the last chapter. This undertaking has a wonderful, gentle style, that reviews the hardships and problems of life in the Virginia mountains in the era portrayed. It has the drawing power from page to page, to find what happens next in the life of the characters. The character of ""Diamond"", revealed intellegence, whimsy, fun and survival skills that came from knowledge beyond ""book learning."" One chapter lead to another to discover if our characters could the hardness of life in the mountains. I believe it is a book for all ages."
1,Uncalled-for efforts,"Although the plot and the characters are fine, if not especially original, the uncalled-for efforts to elevate the style and enrich it with exaggerated imagery, result sometimes in a very overwrought, irritating prose.It's a pity the author had not been more natural and modest."
1,How Predictable,"I have never read Baldacci before, and I don't plan to read him again. I was forced to read this sappy, pat story because it was my book clubs book of the month. Lou, the little girl in the story is twelve years old, and I believe Baldacci was confused by this too often. He wrote her thoughts, and contemplations as though she were a very old, very wise adult. So much of this book was the author's dribble. He tried much too hard to describe the sceneries, and left too much lacking in his characters. His characters were way too predictable. I think he may even have copied some of them from other stories, Huck Finn perhaps. Don't waste your time, or your money reading it."
1,We all knew Amanda was going to wake up in the last chapter.,"Hello David Baldacci, what happened to character development!!?! To begin with, it seems as if a lot of authors seem to get entirely too caught up with surroundings, that they seem to forget about the characters.I read this book for my senior A.P. Literature class and I wanted to throw it out the window after the first 50 pages. Has anyone other than myself noticed that David Baldacci writes novels parallel to how I wrote descriptive essays in the third grade?!This novel stars a twelve-year-old girl named Lou and her brother Oz... and I knew that from the beginning. Yet, throughout the book I wondered if Baldacci forgot what it was like to be twelve. Most adults in their late 30s aren't even on the level of thinking that ""Lou"" is.Overall, the story is meant to play off of human emotions. In today's society, anything that people can relate to or pity, they love.Thumbs down."
5,wish you well by david baldacci,Fantastic! The plot was continously changing and attention grabbing. The ending was somewhat unexpected. First David Baldacci book I have read. Will probably select more.
3,Too much salt,"Baldaci over cooked his descriptions of everything in this novel. The mean character was super mean, the poor were super poor etc. I felt that the writer was not writing from personal experience and tried to cram too many descriptive details into the story. I thought that the ""dialect"" was overdone. The story changes pace too much at the end giving the reader the impression that the author got tired of milking emotions and decided to try to tie up all the loose ends in a couple of pages. Reads more like Garrison Keiler than Baldaci."
5,FABULOUS BOOK!!!,"""Wish You Well"" was an excellent book that I couldn't put down! I was crying so hard during parts of the book, everyone was coming up to me to see what was the matter. I grew to love the characters as if I were on that mountain sharing a piece of their life! David Baldacci captures the spirit and the essence of what life is like, even today in the mountains of rural America and its people. This book brought me back to my own homeland of memories that I couldn't seem to express until I flipped through the pages and recognized a ""real spirit"" and love for simplicity. Please read it, you won't be dissapointed, you laugh, cry, and become part of the community in Virginia!! Great read for young adults, too. ENJOY :)"
4,Multilevel Back to the Basics,"Wish You Well is an engrossing story with strong characters evoking strong emotions in the reader. Set in Virginia mountain country, Wish You Well shows fascinating, simple ways to be in tune with the land and your neighbors, to make a living and a life, and to just plain survive the brutalities of wild mountains and weather and hateful neighbors. Author David Baldacci also takes the reader back to the basics of good and evil; human motivations don't get much more primal than they are in this story. Considering its laid-back, rural setting, this book contains plenty of action ~ relational, emotional, political, physical. It's the ""many dangers, toils, and snares"" of the song ""Amazing Grace."" In song and novel, love and grace triumph."
4,"A surprising, sentimental, but readable Baldacci","I'm used to David Baldacci's thrillers, which are never less than good. This was somewhat of a surprise, an affectionate tribute to the Virginia mountains from which his family came. Occasionally that affection tips over into melodrama, and the final chapters are indeed contrived with rather too much maudlin sentimentality and fairy-tale ending. A reviewer elsewhere described it rather nicely as ""The Waltons in honey"", and I can understand why. Yet the story is told with style and flair, with generally nicely-caught characters and places. Sure, it's a fairy tale, but we could all use a fairy tale now and then, and this one will melt all but the hardest of hearts.When you read it, you'll find that the title is an especially neat touch."
5,A great book!,Loved the historical aspect. The belief in miracles in a positive way and attaining the goal of your dreamsWithout losing your moral compass.
4,Good Book,Gives a good picture of live in the mountains and the people who lived there. Very interesting with great characters.
3,Didn't appeal to me,"My husband picked up this book at a book sale without looking at it too carefully - he thought it was another Baldacci suspense novel. When we realized this wasn't the case, I decided to give it a try. From the start, I kept wondering if this wasn't a young adult novel. While I'm certainly not a YOUNG adult ; ) I do enjoy the occasional young adult novel if it's well written and engaging. I still couldn't say if this is a young adult novel or not, but I didn't find it engaging at all, neither in terms of plot or characters. It just seemed flat, and reading it felt like drudgery. I didn't finish."
2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this book. I enjoy Baldacci's thrillers and was extremely let down when I read this book. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. This book reminded me of the Oprah book club pick Gap Creek, which I read but did not really care for. Usually a Baldacci book takes me 2-3 days to read and I can't put it down. This book took me 2-3 weeks to read and I finished it only to say that I had finished it and I have never left a book unfinished."
5,Excellent book,"I have always loved the legal novels that Baldacci writes, but this book is lovable on it's own - and shows a wonderful side of the author and some of his background without really being autobiographical. A great read!"
5,Pleasurable,"Pleasurable would have to be word that describes reading this book. The characters, the setting, the story--all put together in a way that makes reading it enjoyable. It tugs at your heart and stirs your emotions. I really hated for it to end. Though this is not like his other books, I hope that he will write another like this sometime in the future."
3,Not Typical Baldacci,Its difficult to compare this to any of Baldacci's other books. I think this is a true story. Sweet story about 2 kids who get raised by their grandmother after father dies and mother goes into a coma. Sweet though I felt a bit removed from the main character. But nice effort.
2,Rather slow moving,"This book was recommended to me by someone who had recently read a novel entitled ""Catherine's Travels"" by Adele Crouch. They said this book was similar and I needed to read it. The only similarity I saw was that each book contained a heroine. Catherine's Travels was much stronger. Had far better descriptions and gave me the sensation of being a part of its place and time. I could easily see Catherine's Travels as a top rate movie, in comparison Wish You Well was one of those books you kept reading in ""hopes"" that something would happen. Unfortunately, only the predicatable did. I feel that Baldacci should stick to writing books like Absolute Power. Even though there is evidence of numerous hours spent researching Virginia, the writing was dry."
3,Departure for Baldacci,"David Baldacci leaves behind his usual courtroom glitz for the rural '40's in this tale of reconstructing a family. Good characters, intersting settings, and a well-played out courtroom drama pull this story together. Not a bad read, but if one truly wants to read this type of story, I would highly recommend TAKING LOTTIE HOME, by Terry Kay."
3,My first Baldacci book,"I hear I should have started with a different book.David Baldacci gave us memorable characters, an interesting setting, a couple side plots and an entertaining book, but I couldn't help comparing the story with some other pieces of literature.The story was predictable. Like many family courtroom dramas, the end was twisted, but came out like you thought it would. Just when you think nothing more could happen to this family, the barn burns down. I know barn burning was a reality, but again?Overall, I was entertained, but found the saga of the Cardinal family a bit predictable."
4,Warm Inspiring Story,"Baldacci generally succeded in his break out of his legal thriller genre to give all of us a sweet tale of Louisa Mae Cardinal and Oz in their transition from New York City to a small backwoods house with their grandmother. This is a nice sweet book, and is worth your time to read. The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars was I felt that the ending was a bit too coincidental."
2,Boring-nothing to it.....,"Did not like this book....Certainly nothing like his previous books, but I found nothing good about this one....I don't get all the good reviews, but I guess someone always likes something.Don't waste your time."
4,One of my first by Baldacci,"I rate this writer up there with Patterson and Grisham, you cannot put it down. I will be reading more of his books."
3,Wish You Well,Kept reading and reading for something to happen and all I got were words and more words in descriptive phrases.Lovely and complete but no action.
2,Wish You Well,"I found the contents not to be as thrilling/adventurous, not a great plot as his other books. It was different but pleasant."
1,confused schlock!,"This book is wrought with pain and suffering as the reader struggles to keep it in hand when overwhelmed with the desisre to pitch it across the room. ""Wish You well"" was my first Baldacci read and, had it not been my book club's pick I would have never read it.It is so blatantly stolen from Harper Lee, Mark Twain and Shirely Temple movies. It is trite, corny and down-right unreadable. The characters lack authenticity; their dialogiues forced and artificle. The plot is worse than predictable- it is annoyingly unimaginative and sachrine. I am shocked that this book ever got published and even more surprised that the editors allowed their names to be published in the book's's finale. I would have definitely remained anonomous."
2,Maybe a good children's book--maybe,"This book was simplistic, unrealistic and predictable. Maybe I kept comparing it to John Grisham's THE PAINTED HOUSE which I read a few weeks ago. Maybe I kept comparing it to any good book. Come on now, happily skipping out to the barn in their flour sack clothes to milk a sick cow! Obviously Baldacci never experienced wearing something out of flour sacks or dealing with a sick cow."
1,The author should stick to mysteries.,"This book is about as far as you can get from Baldacci's other works. I found the story very slow moving.The narrator is a sure cure for insomina. I will never again listen to anything she reads.The ending of this book is so unrealistic that it defies any possible logic. Yet the way the story was written, this ending was telegraphed about one quarter into the book.Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Wake me up - please,"I slept throught this book. It was like rocking in a hammock on a warm summer day, with just a slight breeze and your eyelids grow heavy and the book slides off and falls to the ground -- and that is where I left it. What a snoozer. If you like gentle stories, with rich backgrounds of daily living this is it. This is so unlike his other books, I was disappointed."
2,Wish You Well,The book is a non-standard size. I don't recall it being represented as a non-standard (5 1/2x8)size. ADD
2,Unhappy customer,"I've purchased many used books, but this one was in terrible condition. The binding was broken and it had previously been sold thru Goodwill..."
3,Virginia Mountain Life,"I picked this book up and put it down several times before really getting into it. It just didn't hold my interest in the beginning. In the end, I was glad I read the book. It got more interesting as it went along, especially if you're from the Virginia mountains and can relate to the life style and scenery.The story centers around two children and their paralyzed mother who go to live in the Virginia hills after a car accident kills the father and damages the mother. There they meet their grandmother who lives off the land and life is much tougher than it was in the city. In the meantime, a court battle ensues over the grandmother's land, which causes the reader to keep reading just to find out how this will all end.Emotionally it seemed a little calculated and over done, but all-in-all, not a bad book."
3,"Not his best, but worthy of a read","I am a big fan of Baldacci as a mystery/thriller author, so decided to check out his side venture in this book inspired in part by his mother's life. I agree with previous reviewers that there are shades of To Kill a Mockingbird and other influences in this novel, and as such, even though inspired by his family's life, it didn't feel like a truly original idea or original characters. That being said, I did enjoy it. It was a fast read and those who may have read other reviews of mine know character development is important to me - I was able to connect with the characters enough to care about the outcome of the novel. Predictable? Absolutely. But, worth a read. Just don't expect the quality of this other novels. This is a complete departure."
4,Predictable but charming,"This is the first (and only) I have read of Baldacci, and I wasn't aware until reading reviews here that it was a departure from his usual genre. It was recommended to me by a male friend who told me, ""This is so obviously a chick book, but I loved it""!Even though most of the story, and certainly the conclusion, is predictable, I still found myself with tears streaming down my face at the end. The characters are charming, and Baldacci's description of life in Appalachia made me long for a simpler time and lifestyle."
4,Wish You Well,"The story in this book had many interesting details about subsistance living in the Appalachin mountains in the late 1930's and early 1940's. The writing was excellent thus being very enjoyable to read. The story line was very good except for the improbable ending. If you enjoy books about families working a difficult farm life and seeing the merits of their life, you should enjoy this book. It is a departure from this author's usual genre (mystery-suspense), as is John Grisham's book, The Painted House, which I also thoughly enjoyed."
4,Moved Along,As my first summer reading material after 10 months of required reading in school this book was great. I thought it started pretty slow but the last 3rd of the book was amazing and incredibly hard to pur down. I was actually on a plane when I finished the book and it left me in a really good mood with a huge grin. The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars was because it was too slow for the first 100 pages of the book.
2,Baldacci Bombs,"I should be a Baldaccci expert since I've read them all. This was the worst. The first part of the book drags. The reader expects ""page turners."" I was turning in hopes of an interesting plot developing. Mom's in a coma and oh please don't tell us she's going to wake up when the day needs saving! But that day is so terribly implausible. What was the geologist doing hanging around the court so he could spill the beans? How could Hugh Miller think that natural gas in a pipeline would ruin the environment like logging and coal? Wasn't he suppose to be a smart lawyer? David, go back to suspense where you excel."
2,Not my favorite,I have read all of Baldacci's books and they were all terrific. This one however leaves a lot to be desired. Is he trying to get on Oprah's book club? The characters are not even interesting. I can't belive that I read the whole book but I did because I kept searching for a plot that never happened.
4,"A bit dry, but pleasant enough.","Though I would not race right out and buy this book, perhaps you could borrow it, as it IS an easy-paced, well-written story. Lou and Oz are orphaned at ages 12 and 8, their father has died in a car wreck, their mother is hopelessly comatose. They have no family except a great grandmother, Lou's namesake, living in the Appalachian Mountains. She is thrilled to take them in, but Lou and Oz must adapt from a New York City lifestyle to that of mountain folk, whose chores are endless, and where nothing you need is ever store-bought. Lou harbors a deep resentment of her comatose mother, blames her, in fact, for her father's death, whereas 8 year old Oz adores his mother, and believes with childlike faith that with enough attention and love, his mother will get better. There are a couple of side conflicts to entertain you, but not much excitement. Even if it doesn't keep you up at night, it will occupy a few lazy summer afternoons."
3,Entertaining...but lightly so.,"This book was my first by Baldacci. I enjoyed it, however, it was very light and airy. Definitely predictable and at times seemed as though it was written for a 4th grader. I wanted to like it more than i did. I have heard that this book is very different from the author's usual writing so i will definitely try out another book of his."
2,Not so good ending,"Good at spots, but a not so good ending. I am annoyed by books were people do stupid things, and both the kids and the lawyer seemed to loose IQ at the book limped to a close. Not as good as his others."
5,"""Outstanding""","I have enjoyed David Baldacci writings since his first book Absolute Power. But, this time he will definitely make it to Number One. A fine read. One you will enjoy again and again. Thank you David."
4,Triumph of Human Spirit,"Baldacci manages to take a fairly simple story line and turn it into a deeper message about triumph of the human spirit. Within a serene mountain setting interrupted by the occasional mine blast, our independent-minded heroine, Lou, overcomes multiple tragic losses yet remains realistic and steadfast throughout. In being sent to the childhood home of her dead father, she discovers who she is through her family's past and in the end realizes that... oh, I won't spoil it for you.I enjoyed this book tremendously and in fact, read it over just two evenings. It is a real page turner and beautifully written. If you enjoy colorful, yet familiar, characters and uplifting ""discovering life"" stories then this one is for you."
2,Hillbillies R Us,"Reactions to Wish You Well will depend, in large part, on the reader's tolerance level for ""hillbilly"" dialect. Page after page of sentences teeming with double negatives and ""ain't this, cain't that"" is not everyone's idea of a good read. Worse, Baldacci's characters are one-dimensional, straight out of central ""mountain people"" casting. The scenes suffer from a stunning lack of originality and depict situations that have been sentimentalized and ""Waltonized"" in many, many other works before Baldacci. For example, Lou and Oz's first day at the one-room schoolhouse starts off with the local boys taunting them for Yankees, and ends with Lou giving them a whollop--thus earning the instant respect and admiration of their tormentors. Ho hum. The book rarely rises above that kind of middle-school level."
3,Wish You Well~,"Wish You Well is the second book of Baldacci's that I've read, the other being The Christmas Train. Realizing that these two novels are not his normal genre, I am not comparing them to his other works. Wish You Well is a cute, entertaining read that is a southern tale of life living in the Virginia mountains.The story centers around two children, Lou and her little brother Oz, who find themselves living with their great grandmother, Louisa May Cardinal, after being in a tragic accident. Meeting Louisa for the first time, the children have to adapt to a completely different way of life, coming from New York City, to a small, rural place that contains no electricity, running water or any modern day convenience.Baldacci does a good job of painting the image of mountain life, it's inhabitant's struggles, trials and tribulations. It was a bit long, and is not a page turner, but it is a charming and entertaining story."
5,A pleasant change,I am a big Baldacci reader and fan. I wasn't sure I was going to read this book since the review said it was a change from the super thrillers that he normally writes. Well.....I am glad that I took the plunge and read the book. It is a nostalgic trip back to the Virginia mountains from New York City. He spins a great tale about the struggles of living in the mountains and true to form gets some Baldacci suspense in the end. A must read. Could even make a good movie!
5,Happily ever after? Sometimes!,"I have been saving good books for my children since I was a child, much as my mother did for me. This book, in its first printing, was one such book, passed to me by my mother when I was about 13 or 14, about to be passed to my eldest. Set in the post-WWII years, this book is part of a wonderful series about two families, the Parrishes and the Jordans, who are stationed together in the Army and whose lives interweave, especially through the heroine of this book, Tippy Parrish Jordan.There are so many trite, poorly written and depressing books out for our young adults now, that I find it refreshing to offer my children books that reflect old fashioned values and ideas. Though these books have typical 50's roles for men, women and African Americans, they are none the less still topical, as they deal with how young girls grow up and fall in love. I heartily recommend all of these books!"
3,The Blame Game,"EBTG are seriously sticking to their underground club sound with the release of ""Blame."" In addition to the album version, there are three other mixes by J. Majik, Grooverider and Fabian. The Majik remix is dark and brooding with barely discernable processed vocals looped over undulating beats. Grooverider's dub mix is very jazzy, still quite underground. Fabian's upbeat drum n bass waxes jazzy too, but is less morose than the other mixes. This release is definitely more of a European release and is not on par with American tastes. EBTG are releasing the title track, ""Temperamental,"" as the next US single with remixes by such US House favorites as Hex Hector and Ralphi Rosario."
4,Great little mystery!,"This was the first Sister Carol Anne O'Marie book I read and it was truly delightful. Sister Mary Helen reminds me of Miss Marple. If you like Agatha Chrisie's works, you'll like Sister O'Maries books. Unlike other reviewers, I followed along quite easily and never felt left in the dark because I haven't read the other books in the series, though I mean to devour the rest of the series quite soon on my Kindle 2!"
5,A Vocal classic!,"Not many vocalists have the sensitivity of Mary Margaret O'Hara, let alone the lungs. Her technique can transform from the velvety to the guttaral within a phrase while still staying true to the complex subject matter of her songs. With the multitude of pseudo-earthy female vocalists parading their neuroses and dimestore angst in the media these days, ""Miss America"" remains a breath of fresh air accross the ears of those who appreciate sincerity, sophistication and a healthy dose of modesty."
1,Contains one truly awfull song,"Intersting that all reviewers want to dish out the 5 stars here. Im a fan of this artist and her singing is so unique and beautiful you will want to cry. In Tornoto, she is a treat to hear live. The production here is good, and some tracks are excellent. Actually her singing is amazing and rivals and/or exceeds many of the top Divas in music...But! ...A New Day is one of the worst songs I have ever heard...repetitious, unrelenting, horrifying, I sometimes put this track on repeat and wait until somebody screams. How did that track ever end up here. Takes two stars off the album, leaving it with 1. If you are into the worst songs ever, if you are into unlistenable music...'A New Day' is a masterpiece of cheese. CD worthy of a collection for the right and wrong reasons. See also 'The Henry's' and check out her sister (I think)actress Catherine Ohara."
4,A Canadian secret,"I bought this on the advise of a friend who produced this and is a well-regarded music pro. Mary O'Hara has a small but devoted following in Canada. She is talented, maybe less erratic than Jane Siberry. This album is probably out of print; I think my copy came from Germany. It is worth looking for."
5,Innovative format,This book employs an innovative format to allow the reader to form his own opinion about Robspierre based on three different viewpoints without distorting the historical facts. Challenging and highly recommended
1,Concrete Pottery and Garden Furniture,This is a complete cheat! The books DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY ILLUSTRATIONS - which makes the whole text useless since it is a description of each of the photographs.DON`T BUY!!!!!!!
1,worthless book,This book consists of notes and descriptions of illustrations that are not in the book. This book has no value whatsoever for anyone interested in ornamental concrete or art
4,The book was helpful,"The book had a lot of good, useful information in it for beginners to experts. Wish when they copied it they would have enlarged the print. Some of the pictures and pages were dark, so you couldn't get full beneifit of instructions. Over all, was helpful. The explanations and directions were easy to understand and carry out. For a beginner like me,it gave me practical information in a clear manner that encouraged me to try some of the methods he writes about."
4,Syd's solo debut shines with some talented friends,"When this album first came out over ten years ago it made many Golden Palominos fans very happy. With the help of Richard Thompson, Van Dyke Parks, Michael Stipe and others, Syd finally delivered the goods with a full album of her songs. What makes this album very different from her 2nd effort ""War & Peace"" is that it is mainly made up of collaborations with other artists -- continuing in the same vein as the two previous records she made with the Golden Palominos. Syd has a remarkable voice and a one of a kind sense of humor. A decade later she continues to make wonderful music with a much more golden voice and an even funnier outlook on life and the world. Anyone who appreciates great songwriting and an even greater production value should pick up a copy of Surprise - possibly the most overlooked album of the late 80's/early 90's."
4,Essential for the late 80s college group,"Syd Straw accompanied me through the summer before my senior year and filled my Walkman ears across England, Italy, and Germany after that. This CD is essential to replacing old tapes in that late 80s collection. The Michael Stipe cameo is standard for its time--and good!"
3,Thank goodness for CD reissues,"Thank goodness for CD reissues. Surprise was originally released by Virgin Records in 1989 and it truly is a surprise. If one judges others by the company that they keep, Straw is a member of a talented and accomplished circle: guests on Surprise include Marshall Crenshaw, Richard Thompson, Ry Cooder, Michael Stripe and Van Dyke Parks.The majority of the compositions are up-tempo. `Think Too Hard,' `Crazy American' and `Racing To The Ruins' all rock with session drummers Jerry Marotta and Jim Keltner providing a solid backbeat.The other songs are interesting narrative ballads. `Chasing Vapor Trails' is about love lost but this time with a twist: Straw decides that its pay-back time for her heartless ex-beau. The biggest surprise is Stephen Foster's 1859 `Hard Times.' 130 years after the original composition, Straw successfully shows that grief and sorrow are timeless and universal."
2,Girl can't write a hook,"I originally bought this on the strength of a vid of Future 40's on the old Videospin show, but it was a waste. It's just another bunch of mild ballads about this and that, no new ground at all, and she really can't quite get a song right. It's telling that by far the best song on the album was written by Stipe. Save your money."
2,Less than 50% chance of getting a working one - POOR Support,"I bought 2 transporters. One did not work out of the box. It will not charge. The other works ok - but does not provide the run time advertised with a 120 lb rider on smooth, flat surfaces. I have been trying to work with Go Motorboards' customer support, calling daily, just getting bounced from voice mail box to voice mail box. This seems like a company run out of someones garage. For the $350 cost, you would expect more. I would not recommend buying this, and certainly not online, as you will loose your shipping costs when you are stuck returning it."
1,GoMotor-Bored,"The design is Great! But don't let that be the deciding factor. The support blows. The batteries blow. Overall, I'd say it blows. I've had mine for six months and have had the batteries replaced six times (how's that for recharge technology?). I took their re-charge ""advice"" and still...horrible. Now I've run into a motor problem (no doubt the result of poor charging ability). I kept trying to tell their technician that I think the circuit board might have a loose connection or short, but nooooo, it was the battery pack. Oh, and now it's the wheels, not the motor. Well guess what...I cannot recommend this pile to anyone. I'd rather walk. Thanks GoMotorboard."
5,This thing is fast !!!,"I was amazed at the speed and nimbleness of this scooter. I honestly have never been to full throttle because the ground starts to move real fast, real quick. With the inline skate style wheels, there is amazing lateral movement; which is great for cornering and pulling a few G's. If you or your children have the time, you gotta go for it. This is my third scooter and it will be my last, built tough and is light years ahead of the others out there both in quality and technology."
2,So close and yet so far,"I could have posted a glowing review up until 3 weeks after finally getting my 1500. ... But when I got it, oh happy day! Fun while it lasted...I've emailed and called Go because my Motorboard just stopped working about 17 days later as I recall. ..."
2,"no basket, disappointed",I like the weight of the scooter but without a basket its practically useless.
1,1500suX - Won't charge right out of the box,Would have been nice to try my own. Would not hold a charge right out of the box. Customer support / warranty support is non-existant from Go Motorboards. Shipping costs lost! I would not recommend buying this until they resolve their quality issues! Make sure you try YOURS before your buy!
2,"good scooter, terrible costumer service","I bought this motorboard several months ago. I was very pleased with the motorboard. It has a very good design, is powerful, and has good battery life. One of the batteries went bad however and this has soured my opinion of this company. I have been unable to get any help with the problem. Call to the company for tech support result in being transfered to an answering machine. Emails to tech support go unanswered. Now I have a $300 piece of junk because of one dead battery and no help from go motorboards."
4,Okay,"I've had my motorboard since March because after receiving a bad battery, we had to get a new one. This one has been fine, although it can't do the 12 mile run it says it can do, especially if you live in hilly areas like Michigan. It doesn't have the best warrenty(only 90 days) and the price has gone up a bit(used to be $300), but all in all its probably the best scooter. Those bigger, bulkier scooters probably don't go as fast and if the charge runs out, how are you going to get it home? The motorboard is harder to kick, but you CAN kick it, and it only weighs 22 pounds. It also charges fast(3 1/2 hours a charge) and it has a cool look. I would say that you should purchese it, but buy it from some place where you can get it from a store just in case something happens."
3,That'll do pig.....,"even though I had rather bad results with a 1st elec scooter, (an XTR lite) whilst browsing last Sun. in a Sports Chalet with my 10 y.o. daughter I ended up buying two! Go Motorboard scooters. (the short scoot down the store aisles was pretty amazing!) It's fast and it's light but unless you're riding on SMOOTH as a baby's butt concrete you WILL feel the road! (our feet and hands got numb after a 9 minute ride around a shopping center parking lot. There is zero suspension in these things.The steering is a little too goosey as well (Tighter bearings would help) but all in all, I'd say the GoMotorboard is a pretty decent 2nd generation elec. scooter. It will zip a grown-up around quite well. However, whether it will continue to do so over weeks/months remains to be seen (and that, for me, is the main issue with elec scooters)"
2,says for grown ups but not!,"i recieved this lil gadget for Christmas and i have to say that i was pleasantly surprised at the technology of the motor. it is state of the art when it comes to the quality of the scooter. the one problem i have is on the wheels of the scooter. one, there is zero suspension, i mean zero. you will have to be on smoothe surface at all times. this means absoulutly no cracks, bumps, rocks or anything of that matter. the wheels suck really bad. my first ride the rear wheel spoke cracked which was a real disappointment. it seems to happen alot through what i have read and it is mentioned many times in the manual on how to prevent this. i am very careful when riding but it seems these wheel are the only flaw. you buy one, have fun for a short while and be prepared to spend a fortune on replacement wheels because this will happen no matter how careful you are and what surface you are on."
4,Malice - 'In The Beginning' (Wounded Bird),"Originally released in 1985,this appears to be the Los Angeles metal band's first effort.Just as good as their 'License To Kill' disc(see my review).Like Armored Saint,Savatage and King's X,I've always felt that Malice never did receive their just due.Alright,ENOUGH complaining.Tracks that carry this reissue CD,plus make it a real keeper were ""Rockin' With You"",their Judas Priest-like ""Air Attack"",""Squeeze It Dry"",the rocking ""The Unwanted"" and ""Godz Of Thunder"".Recommended,of course if you like '80's metal."
2,KandelKorner's cable not the pictured cable BBW,"The cable was decent but generic, which is the same cable selling for much less here and on Ebay. So 2 stars its good but not as good as the pictured cable. They made too much money, I was willing to pay more for the pictured cable not the one I got which could have been had for half this price shipped."
2,Very disappointing,"I'd heard a lot about this cd, and was excited to play it. I kept waiting, and waiting for a tune that would stick with me. No compelling melodies, or any reason to hear any song twice. I'm more of a melodic pop/rock, power pop type, and this is definitely not that. Not recommended for fans of that genre. I suppose it was somewhat experimental (not a bad thing), but there was nothing to take home at the end of the journey."
5,Best Release of 2002 So Far...,"Anyone who can appreciate the simple joy of a well produced great pop/rock tune and isn't too wrapped up in the White Rebel Strokes Club posturing 'indie' garage rock scene will appreciate every single song on this record.Look, it's not brain surgery here. Just good hooks, good verses, good choruses, you know, good music. Not too predictable, definitely not too experimental. Elements of Teenage Fanclub, Fountains of Wayne and, dare I say it, Supergrass.I hate their name. I hate their album cover. I LOVE their music."
4,A good but bulky laptop,"Before buying this laptop, I compared just two non-widescreen models, HP ZE5570US and this Toshi. The HP has too much silver plastic and it's just not my taste thought the HP is not that bulky as Toshi. For nearly one month ownership, A25-S279 is overall a good laptop as expected. The performance of 2.8P4+480M (512M-32M video) is more than enough for programming and some graphics s/w. Harddrive is very quiet. 54G wireless is no problem with my D-Link DI624 router. Not sure about PC game though.However, you should notice there's no free CD burning s/w bundled but a trial one. Also the depth is a bit larger than a regular laptop. Be sure it'll fit your notebook case. They are the reasons I bought a Nero 6.0 Ultra and Samsanite carry case."
1,Beware,"I bought all the supplements, in particular the JNK, started taking it with my psych meds during the pre taper and then everything went wrong. The supplements which were supposed to help with withdrawal sent me into a hellish tailspin. They interfered with my drugs and I became hyper symptomatic. These supplements induced tremendous anxiety and their so called Relax supplements did nothing to relieve my suffering. Finally threw their rubbish in the garbage and stayed on my meds. It took nearly a week to get back to baseline. Don't mess with your meds unless you're seeing a skilled professional such as a holistic psychiatrist with an MD."
1,disappointed,"I was really excited to get this book in the hopes that it would give me some insight and help in my work with the many clients who are concerned about being addicted to pharmaceutical psychotropic drugs.However, there is no benefit to purchasing this book. The corresponding website has all the information contained in the book and the bulk of the published version is simply multiple repeated pages of the same worksheet . It would have been better as a pamphlet with one copy of the worksheet that anyone could xerox."
5,Simple and Effective,"I bought this program in desperation as I've been on Effexor and Ativan and saw my personality changing terribly. My wife, kids and employer all complained and I thought I'd never get off these terrible meds. I started the program and did a few things wrong. I called Label Me Sane and they were so helpful and got me back on track. Now I'm off the Effexor and getting through the Ativan. I've never felt better and my depression is gone! I sleep through the night and my personality is back to normal. Thank you Label Me Sane and James Harper! You are a true godsend."
1,Second edition is free,"The book is good but Label Me Sane is selling a book that is no longer in use by the author. The second edition of The Road Back is out, with updates on how to get off drugs and the book is free on The Road Back Web Site.Good book but I feel duped for paying $24.95 for old information, with the new information given away for free by the author.Makes me wonder about motive?"
4,Four for Texas,this is one frank sinatra and dean martin movie that I likethis is one movie that I hope will not be remade because nobody can top the stars in it.
4,What's not to like?,"Well Sinatra and Martin are classy and funny, the ladies are sexy, the supporting cast generates laughs and we even get the three stooges for good measure doing their classic <clap clap clap> TEXAS skit.this is no movie classic but it is a fun picture that doesn't take itself too seriously. In that vein you will enjoy it."
3,4 For Texas 1963,"Frank Sinatra (1915-1998) and Dean Martin (1917-1995) play wily Business rivals in this wild West lark og gambling and romance . It?s 4 for Texas as the two sars joined by Busty Swedish Anita Ekberg (1931- ) (measurements: 40-22-36 in 1950) and Ursula Andress (1936- ) , vie for oneupmanship at the card tables of 1870s Galverston .The cards hold a lot more fun when the film?s many talented co-stars join in . The three stonges turn up in a trademark slapstick sketch . Preening Victor Buono (1938-1982) is the most deviius , double-crossing villain this side Snidely Whiplash . And Charles Bronson (1921-2003) is rattlesnake-mean gunslinger with a nasty habit of absorbing more lead than he dishes out . At center stagecoach shootout to final riverboat melee , pals Sinatra and Martin clearly have a blast , So will you . High Quality digital transfer ."
2,Not up to par,"When this glue dispenser came I opened it and was a little disappointedthe quality is not what i would say good. the plastic is very thin, and the coverdoe's not seal well."
4,My review is for ballroom dancers,"If you're just learning tango and wish to practice on your own, this is a wise investment. You won't have to disrupt your practice running back and forth to your cd player to select tracks. You won't drive yourself nuts listening to the same song stuck on loop play. Basically, this is a good cd of classical, non-elevator tango music that does not beat you over the head with a nausiating DUM DUM DUM DUM beat. (Well, most of the songs do not.)There are a few lousy tracks within this collection, but it has been my experience that with all cds there will always be tracks you tend to skip over.Do not let the $14.99 price tag for a two disk set turn you off. This is good music."
3,close but not best ever,It's a nice CD but about half is not tango music. Nice to listen to but to dance you have to make your oun complation.
4,Very nice music to dance or listen,A bit more contemporary than what we usually dance to. More like what you would expect to hear with that great tango in a great movie.
5,Amando el T,Best Tango EverGreat instrumental arrangement and wonderful mix of old timeless pieces. Its a great buy with two CD full of wonderful T
5,Tango,"best tango, great to listen, to dance, I bought it as a present and it was just the best I found"
3,Solid Mix,"I didn't like some of the tracks, because the bordered upon the sedate. I like a strong beat that inspires me to dance, and this set largely delivers. If you are looking for your first tango CD, this one will not disappoint."
5,Excellent CD,"Tango music seems hard to find, expeccially of such ggod quality. Happy to have found ""The Best Tango Album in the World, Ever!"", now to the dance floor!!"
2,Best Tango Album,I love tango music but unfortunately this album has only about two good numbers. The rest are the type that end up grinding on your ears.
3,Something is missing.,I got the feeling that 1/3 of the title were included just to justify the double volume. I would a smaller number of tracks but with more passion.
5,Most Outstanding Purchase in the last 12 Months;,"I can truly say that this purchase was an outstanding ""Surprise"", I didn't know that I would receive one C.D. but 2 C.Ds...I have waited many years to hear Ms Elaine Page sing on Tv which then allowed me to trace to Ämazon, Thank you...Every track is so good please bear in mind that I am 72 years young,I would recommend this to anyone of my era !! Good on YOU ""Ämazon""'RegardsGeoffrey."
5,The best Amboy Dukes Best Of compilation to date!!!,"This is by far the best Amboy Dukes greatest hits compilation that has been released. The sound is excellent and the best part is it includes the full version of ""Prodigal Man"" which had been butchered on other Amboy Dukes best of CD's."
2,"Dropping acid, anyone?","Okay, after buying and listening to this album, I no longer know whether or not to believe uncle Ted when he says that he didn't know 'Journey to the Center of the Mind' was about taking LSD. But that is his business, not mine, and I can't hold it against him. So maybe he thought it was about dropping acid? H-mmm...Regardless, this album is for fans of psychedelic rock. Or, acid rock. Or maybe just acid. Who knows? But anyone looking for classic Ted Nugent guitar may, and probably will, be disappointed with this album. And, if uncle Ted didn't know it was about taking LSD, he was the most naive sumbitch to ever play rock 'n roll music! This album is worth having as part of a Ted Nugent/Amboy Dukes collection, probably, but only just barely, and most Ted fans will most likely only listen to it once or twice."
2,Missing Some Essentials,"This era of The Amboy Dukes was by far not their best music. On this collection you get nothing from the excellent Tooth Fang And Claw, or Call Of The Wild period, just prior to Nugent's CBS solo career and superstardom. These are mainly silly, awkward 3rd rate psychedelic tunes here. Nugent would toughen up and streamline his sound to make better records with The Dukes in the early to mid seventies. Consult your local used record store."
5,Before Ted Nugent went ultraconservative.,"Yes it has Baby Please Don't Go, Journey To The Center Of The Mind, Colors and the Outstanding Loaded For Bear, but it was this one that stood out for me:Dr. Slingshot - Ted Nugent & The Amboy Dukes - 1968 - ""Good first impression on this Jimi Hendrix-esque song that has hot guitar HOOKS and drum work. I think I know where Prince and Lenny Kravitz got their inspiration from. BEST CD track?""The below albums are covered somewhat.The Amboy Dukes [import] (debut 1967): Covers 12/13. Two 5 star songs.I have this on CD. This is well covered by Loaded For Bear.Journey to the Center of the Mind (1968): covers 7/13. Three 5 star songs.Migration (1969): Covers 6/11. A couple of 4 star songs.BOTTOM LINE: Don't expect Ted Nugent to sound like he did when he went solo, BUT you may like him more during this era ~1967-1968."
3,visiting some old friends,"This is about what I expected. It can't replace the 2 albums I used to own, but it had the songs I wanted to hear most. The band I was in back in high school(37-38 yrs. ago)used to play ""Good Natured Emma"" and ""Migration"" so I'm particularly happy to have those again. I really wasn't interested in and don't really care for the stuff from the first album, but that doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the rest of the CD. Not bad for a compilation."
3,Works Good But Breaks Easily if you have kids/ pets that can knock it over,"This item works REALLY well to generate air flow in any room and doesn't take up much space. BUT, if you have kids or pets that can knock it over, or if you tend to knock stuff over, this product is NOT for you. My puppy knocked it over ON CARPET and it doesn't work anymore.Do yourself a favor, and spend the few extra bucks to get a more durable one. Sometimes, you just can't afford to buy cheap, because repairing or replacing cheap items can be more costly than buying the more expensive item in the first place!"
2,Nice Fan But Doesn't Last,Good fan and works well providing you don't use it constantly as I tend to do. It was short lived and broken in under a year which is unacceptable to me. I still have an old Pacific Breeze pedestal fan going on 12 years and it runs daily.
5,I think that this is the new Mutts book,"In it's fourth year Mutts is already the most popular strip in america, what can I say, Mutts kicks all the others butts. Long Live Earl!"
2,Too difficult,The quarters are very difficult to fit in the folder. I would look for a different one to use.
1,Avoid this item whenever possible,"The holes are way to difficult to fit in quarters. The booklet looks very cheap. The cover design is different from what you see here. The interior looks boring and ugly.Very, very disappointed."
1,junk and ugly,I ordered Official Whitman Statehood Quarters Folder: Complete 50 State Set 1999-2008 to my friend as a gift. She said this is a junk and cheating product. This is because its design is ugly and inside has only 40 slots which is 1999-2006. And I agree with her.
1,Damaged product,I received this product ripped on the binding. I could not find an option to contact about this after I recieves it.
1,NOT as described!,"The website said only 50 states included,BUT in fact include District of Columbia and Territories also.The quality is really poor!"
