3,"cute, but not entertaining for my 1 yr old","My baby received this toy as a gift at 11 months. It had her attention for about a day or so, once she knew what it was about she just ignores it. The fish bowl is adorable and has a catchy tropical song but, I think it might be entertaining for a younger child."
5,This toy is a hit!,My daughter loves this toy and this toy can stand up to rough play. I've used it as a cheerio holder and it can amuse any age with its fun sounds and sweet lights.
5,Last a long time,This toy was given to my grandson just as he was sitting up. He played with it then and plays with it now at 2. He loves the music which has 2 levels of sound and the balls that have a sea creature in them.
5,Great toy!,"This was a babyshower gift. My two year old started playing with it immediately - so much that we had to put new batteries in it before my daughter could play with it. She's been playing with it since she was about 5 months old. She's 9 months old now. It's good for all kinds of development: tummy time, sitting, grabbing & nesting. Both of my kids just love it, and the music is quite whimsical. This is a must toy!!!!"
2,Not very fun!,"This toy was a gift from my daughter's aunt. We bought her duaghter the same toy! I thought she would like it...and she did for about five minutes! All it does is light up and play a song. My daughter plays with the balls more than the actual toy. Not a very good idea. What is the point of this toy? Also, it is extremely heavy, which makes it kind of dangerous!!"
2,BORING,"I bought this toy for my 6-month old for Christmas last year. She really didn't play with it that much. She is now 17 months old, and to this day this toy has not interested her at all. It is still on the shelf, in perfect condition. I've gotten it out for her periodically, but this toy does not appeal to her."
2,too many negatives,"I just got this toy for my six month old daughter and I cannot recommend it. Here is why:The batteries don't last at all (empty after ten days)It is way too heavy, my daughter can already pick it up and if she drops it on her head it will really hurt her.The lights and music come on by the slightest touch or vibration, she does not have to do anything to help her learn (like putting the balls in the middle) - just me walking by will make it come on."
5,great for the baby and not annoying for the parent.,My mother in law got this toy for my 4 month old and he LOVES to tap at it and hear the noise. The music is actually good compared to some toys that are horrible. I have found myself hitting it just to hear the music =)
4,Little Girl Loved It,My daughter loves the sound and motion of this fishbowl. She learned how to move her hands in order to pick the balls up within 1/2 hour though - so I am not sure how long she will love it!
3,i think its cute but he doesnt notice it...,i bought this for my son when he was 7 months old. at that time i broke it out of the box because i was so excited - i thought when you put the balls in was the only time the music would play. well if you even touch the ball or you nudge it the music plays.my son looked at it.. threw the balls and crawled away. not interested. well its been a month now and i can still sit him in front of it and.. nothing. he doesnt care and it only plays one song - so for him to not be interested i hate to listen to the music. maybe things will change but for now i am not very excited about this toy.
2,Beware - This does NOT shut off automatically!!,"My son received this toy as a Christmas gift. A few days later, I heard an eerie, low groaning sound coming from the playpen long after my kids had gone to bed. It seems that the combination of the fish bowl's very easily activated motion sensor and its lack of an automatic shutoff feature had caused the toy to play constantly until the batteries just died. Now that they've been replaced, my boys are thrilled, but I have to make sure to flip the switch 'off' about ten times a day."
3,Probably only for younger children,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was about a year old and she really didn't seem too interested in it. Although it's very cute and durable, it might have been that she was too old for it."
3,Premie twins mom review of fish bowl,"Overall this toy is quite durable, but the balls are on the heavy side along with the extra bubbler that came with the fish bowl. I have twins who run on the smaller side, so it may be a couple more months before they would be comfortable playing with the toy. The music and lights are great and they enjoy watching and listening. thanks"
5,By far my son's favorite toy,"I bought the fishbowl for my son at Christmas last year (he was about 6 months old). He didn't quite know what to do with it at first, and his hands were a little small to grab the balls well. But he loved to look and bat at the bowl, and the sound/lights got his attention. As he has grown, this has become one of his favorite toys and still is at nearly 1 1/2 years old. He loves taking the balls out and putting them back in. Another favorite activity is watching the spinners inside the balls as they roll across the kitchen floor."
4,Soon to be Mommy,"I bought this toy to go with our Aquarium nursery theme. The music and sounds are very cute. The colors are good for either a boy or a girl. Overall, I think this is a good toy.I was disappointed in the balls which go in the fishbowl because they are different colors it is difficult to see the little fish inside of them.I was also disappointed with BRU.com because this toy has been discontinued so when I received the toy it was scratched didn't exactly look new. I e-mailed and they said they could not replace it because they had no more in stock but that they would give me a refund. I didn't want a refund. I wanted a replacement so I contacted Fisher Price directly and they sent me a replacement."
3,lights up,I bought this for my 5 month old. He does like looking at the lights and listening to the music. I was so excited to get this in the mail. The only thing is I thought that the water would swirl around automatically instead of having to shake it up. This toy actually entertained my 4 and 5 year old niece and nephew.
5,Great toy!,"This toy is great for younger babies, wonderful for teaching them to grasp things. My son loved to put the balls in and take them out again over and over again and also watch the fish move inside the ball. And the joy on his face when the music plays is priceless. So far it has been pretty durable. I highly recommend this toy!"
5,Excellent toy!,"I bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She loves putting the ""fish"" (balls with little fluttery fish inside) into the ""bowl,"" and even loves playing with the balls by themselves. She giggles when it lights up and plays music.Unlike a lot of musical baby toys, the music this plays is someting that I can enjoy, too. It's not overwhelmingly loud and it doesn't sound like bad video game music. It's got a hip calypso thing going on and doesn't get on my nerves when I'm trying to work.I bought this for all the babies in the family for Christmas, and have gotten some very nice ""Thank Yous"" that said pretty much what I've written, here."
3,HEAVY,"I LOVE FISHER PRICE and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND everything in the OCEAN WONDERS Aquarium series, especially the high chair and cradle swing (both my top picks for my baby #2). They far outweigh the competition in durability and quality (lessons learned from baby #1). This particular toy, which I do like for all the reasons others like it, is VERY HEAVY. With two children of different ages, the threat of one tossing this onto the other is a real one. It could do some serious damage to a skull - not to be dramatic, but as a mom you have to look at the potential dangers and I see this as a very real one. Thought others may want to know."
2,Don't Know Yet,"My daughter is 6 1/2 months old. She's been sitting up for at least 2 weeks. She laughs at this toy when I activate the music. She picks up the balls if I hand them to her. Otherwise, she is NOT interested. Things may change.....but so far, I like this more than she does."
4,Elizabeth loves it,"We bought Ocean Wonders Fishbowl for our 6 month old baby after ready all the reviews and I have to say that Elizabeth loves it. At first she just liked the sounds the fishbowl made, but after a while she got the hang of the flutter balls. Now, not only does she like putting them into the bowl and taking them out, but she enjoys rolling them to me.The only problem we had was one of the little fish got stuck on the upper rim of the fishbowl. Not sure how it happened, but it is not moving."
5,She Bops to the music....,Our 11 month old has been playing with this bowl since she was about 6 months old. She loves the twinkling music and we turn off the lights to watch the bowl light up. She can grasp the three balls easily and she enjoys picking them up and placing them inside the bowl. It's pretty funny to watch her bopping her shoulders and head up and down to the beat. Great baby gift!
3,"Cute, great in theory, but a dud once home!","I purchased this for my 6 month old. We have been working on putting objects in things, rather than just taking them out. It is a cute toy. The music is nice and the underwater theme caught her eye, briefly. However, this isn't a big favorite for her. I was disappointed because I ordered this online, because I couldn't find it in stores. I made a special effort to get it. Unfortunately, it bores her greatly. Perhaps I bought it too late for her, as she has been a crawler for a couple months. Maybe it is ideal for a younger baby or a non-mobile baby.There isn't anything really wrong with it. It just didn't attract my daughter's attention like other toys (i.e. the IncrediBlock, bead maze, pop-up toy, etc).If you want to teach the skill of putting things in and taking them out, save the money and get some bright colored woofle balls and a laundry basket. It seems to engage my daughter more. The balls are fun for her, but other balls are cheaper."
1,Don't buy,This toy is good for a very limited age span. My daughter played for with it for about a month and then became bored of it. It is very heavy for a small child to carry around. This is a toy that looks really neat untill you get it home and realize there's not much to it! Save your money!!!
3,not to great after 12mo,"This toy kept my son entertained for a while when he was 9-12 months. After that he was more interested in stacking or pushing buttons. He does still play with the balls, throwing them at everything he can!"
5,Absolutely FABULOUS!,"I received this fishbowl as a shower gift, and my baby (who is now 11 mths) loved it from the time she could first sit up and peer inside. This was the first container she ever learned to pull toys out of and the first one she learned to put them back into. It still remains as one of the favorites on her list! The music is fun for her and the 2 volume controls are also so great. It's activated by movement on the floor, so if she moves on to play with something else, very often she will be drawn back to it when she hears it's music again!"
2,6 months? Seems better for 9+,"I got this for my 6 mth old and all he did was want to put the balls in his mouth. From other reviews I see that babies older than 6 months like it not 6 mth. olds. I don't know why it is labeled for children 6+, it should be 9+"
3,great for young babies,Great tummy time toy and for grasping. My son loves to still hold the balls in his hand and watch the fish or the shell spin inside the ball. He also likes to use the balls in the tub. The bowl plays cute music but it is short and has to be touched to get it to reactivate. My son occassionally gets interested in playing with the bowl but mostly likes the balls. It is ashame that you can't just buy the balls (LOL!) I would reccomend this toy as a tummy time toy and for sitting.
4,Not to bad of a toy,My daughter liked this toy. The only thing I haven't liked is it seems to run out of batteries awfully quick. I have to make sure as soon as she leaves it that it is turned off. Which is a problem when she starts to play with it while I'm not around.
4,Wonderful Toy!!!,"I was given this toy for my daughter at 8 months. Wonderful! She was just learning to sit-up without falling over. This toy really helped. In just a few days she was sitting with no problem. She loved to hold on to the fishbowl and pull the balls out. Her 2 1/2 old brother also loves to take it away from her. He has learned to turn it on and play with it. They both love the sounds, lights and look at the fish floatting. Would recommend."
5,Excellent toy,"This is a great toy. My 10 month old still plays with it. When I bought it I knew nothing about it, and it is the only toy she plays with. It does play the same song over and over but there is an off switch. The balls that come with help young ones to learn how to pick up objects and also where to put them. It plays music when the ball is placed inside the bowl. The water and fish around the outside of the bowl are beautiful. I am buying this toy for all the women I know who are pregenant, I like it that much. Great toy, great price!"
5,Captivating for little minds,We bought this toy as a Christmas present for our two-month old son; needless to say we turned the toy on and our son heard it - - you could see the curiosity in his little eyes! He's not quite old enough to play with it just yet BUT we're sure this will be one of his favorites!! We were again impressed with Fisher-Price.
4,Fun and Pleasant,"This toy stimulates the little ones with the music, water and sound effects as well as the fun balls with the sea creatures inside. Our daughter especially loves the music."
3,its ok...,"i've read many endtimes outlines. my favorites r under books at fortbethel.com. the info in, 'storm warning' is a bit dated. buy used."
4,Great humor and great jumpin' jazz,"A stellar 20-track collection of some of Gaillard's greatest jive and jazz. Includes his signature ""Lauging in Rhythm"" and 19 more gassers from the late 40s and early 50s. Mastered from a variety of sources including 10"" and 12"" LPs as well as 78s. The sound quality varies, but the energy and humor never wanes.If you liked Joe Jackson's excursion into jump music on ""Jumpin' Jive"", you'll love the originals."
4,Works Wonderfully!!,"If you have, or are buying, a canon bjc-50, 80, or 85 protable printer (the bjc-85 is great), this is really a very neat extra that works wonderfully well. Let's say you're on the road and need a portable printer with you. Now suppose you get a document that you need to copy or fax, but no machines around. Well, just take out your ink cartridge and put in the IS-12, and scan away! Its that easy. The scans are great. Oh, they're not of the calibre of say the HP6300 or Epson 1200, but they're pretty good for a small, lightweight, portable machine to use in a pinch. The color scans (pictures, photos) are very good and the text is clear and very useable. It doesn't come with OCR, so if you want to edit documents - you'll need to buy a good OCR software (I like Omni Page Pro V.10, or Paperport). This is a very handy, very cool item that works just great and is easy to use!"
5,"Legal size document scanning, while out and about","I use the Canon BJC-85 printer for printing and scanning letter and legal size documents while out with clients. The IS12 makes my life easy with great looking scans, without lugging around additional equipment.The biggest complaint I have is that the software isn't Mac OS X compatible, so I end up having to use Virtual PC just to run the scanning software. Not to mention that the scanning software doesn't output to PDF.Beyond those issues, the IS12 is a nice device which works very well and allows me to scan legal size documents, which my flat bed scanner at home will not. Highly recommended!"
4,"Readable, Intelligent Stroll Through Greek History","Charles Freeman in the Greek Achievement (The Foundations of the Western World) will take the reader through 1,500 years of history that is fascinating, entertaining, and enlightening. The information will prove familiar for those who have studied this period but the author throws in opinions at many points to keep his version fresh. This book, though, is perfect for the beginner. It is more than a survey yet not at all bogged down with scholarly detritus. One of the most pleasant discoveries is that this book is not a form of idol worship posing as history (as the subtitle threatens) but a balanced account with examinations of how past historians have looked into the material and how new research changes the interpretations. An easy and satisfying read."
4,A Good Survey for The General Reader,"If you are looking for just one book to do a solid job in surveying the history and contributions of the Ancient Greeks this would probably be the one to buy.Freeman's narrative skills are very good, and he makes reading ""dry history"" a treat. It is written for the general reader who has an interest in learning more about these Greeks who set the table for our western civilization.Note: This will probably be of little use to a scholar. It contains no footnotes, references nor an extensive bibliography."
5,Brilliant overview,"Perhaps the best feature of this extremely well written and lucid text is the ability to selectively read the thematically differentiated chapters. While I read the book from cover to cover and there is a general chronology to the text, the reader could easily jump from section to section based on personal interest. Academic writing that is not obtuse or overly theoretical is often hard to come by. As a previous writer stated, there is perhaps not much interpretation involved, but the overall structure of the text is truly remarkable and should take precedence to any criticism."
3,4:3 Aspect Ratio inexcusable in 2008,"Great sound, song quality. I was pleased with the audio.Video was a joke. It is 2008, and there is no reason/excuse to make a DVD in 4:3 ""fool screen"" aspect ratio. The world has moved to 16:9, and I was pissed that I had to watch the video with huge black pillars on each side. I have a 70"" TV so it could have been worse,"
1,What a shame,"This video had all the makings too be 5 stars, but unfortunatelty it was not remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround, which in this day in age is unexcusable. In fact this video was not even in Dolby 2.0 which was not playable on my surround sound system. I was able too play it on my good old TV speakers though. Yay!!! Don't get me wrong I'm a huge ATR fan but this video was a joke."
4,Great shows,"2 great shows on this dvd, this dvd is awesome, The only negative is that the auio could of been a little better but if your a fan its a must have,,!"
5,Great HDTV,"This is an awesome HDTV. I purchased it to hang above my fireplace and it fit the bill fantastically. I didn't purchase mine from Amazon but have had this exact TV for 9 mo's and experienced no problems. It was simple to set up, has every input we need. The picture in HD is awesome. Football is in HD is incredible on this TV. I also use it to watch instant streaming video from Netflix with my laptop and the picture is better than digital TV. The only complaint I have is the range on the remote. It does not work beyond 10 feet, which makes it nearly impossible to change channels/volume from my kitchen table (15 feet). I ordered a cheap multifunction remote to hopefully fix this. I remain a bit skeptical on the longevity of this TV due to all of the bad press on Westinghouse HDTV's, but so far so good."
2,Poor Quality,"This cheap plastic step-up ring is poor quality. It does not stay on the lens well, and it wants to cross-thread easily because the threads are too shallow. It pops off the lens easily if bumped, and does not hold filters well. It is best to avoid this ring and find a better brand preferably made of metal.I gave this item two stars because it works, it just doesn't work very well."
4,Look Great! saves $$$$,"OK....this is a pretty simple reivew. I bought his tail light assembly to replace the one in my 2002 dodge dakota that had become cracked. Did NOT want to give the dealer $109 for OEM, and I ordered this one from Amazon. It was Prime so shipping cost was not a problem, and It fit and looks just like new. It took all of 5 minutes to change out."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"First of all, I guess It was my fault, I didn't realize it was a DVD. Second ,I didn't think much of it."
3,A Mixed Collection of Writing,"Contrary to what the translator claims in the introduction, based on this collection of short stories, Mishima Yukio's work as a novelist far exceeds in quality that of the short story writer. While some stories are quite good - ""Acts of Worship,"" ""Cigarette,"" and ""Sword"" come to mind - and demonstrate not only the thought but also the large amounts of research Mishima put into his writing, others only evince lukewarm sentiments or insights into the author's aesthetic tastes. While this in itself is certainly not enough to merit a ""low rating,"" these same sentiments are more effectively conveyed in his novels.Another complaint is that these stories are presented largely in an ahistorical way. That is, there is little reference to when Mishima wrote them, what he was experiencing at the time, and what the situation of Japan was like, socioeconomically. Understanding these concepts is crucial to understanding Mishima's motives and writing."
4,Colorful.,This a great collection to get a sense of Mishima's imaginative spectrum of characters and themes. Death and the adolescent psyche are common themes.
2,I have had more fun with a bag of sharp glass.,The creators of this game wasted great graphics on a game with not enough depth. The only time I had fun playing this is when I paused it and took a nap and had a dream about Pamela Anderson. There weren't any guns and the game was way to hard.
3,Its ok,"Interesting CD for a change and a good compilation. the instrumentation part of the CD is pretty good, nevertheless Jerrys voice is lacking in some songs... no match for the original songs.If you liked FRuiz, however, it might be interesting to have it in your collection - but there were better releases this year."
4,Worth it,"My daughter got this toy last Christmas when she was 2. She liked it, but wasn't totally enthused. Now at 3, she is more into it & we tried another cartridge (Science- Living Things). I am a middle school science teacher & I was really impressed with this cartridge! My son is 15 mos & he also really loves Kasey, but I have to cover the on/off button & play with him. My daugher is able to play with Kasey independently. The only thing that I really don't like about the toy is the screen - it really needs its own light source. It is too dark & hard to see sometimes, esp. if you aren't right in front of it in a bright room. This is tough when you are playing with a child who may a need a little help - it is hard for you both to see. Kasey the Kinderbot is really cute & teaches a lot. It is very different from the Leap Pad type toys, so it is still worth getting even if you have one of those already."
2,How do you get the feet off,"I have one, but the batteries corroded the metal connector. How do I get the feet off, so I can replace the contacts? Any advise is appreciated. Tx"
4,"Great toy, hours of fun","This toy has my two year old engaged for hours. He leans about different shapes and opposites and word association. He just loves it! It comes with different cartriges so you can change to math or science (but my two year old is not ready for that yet), it just means that this toy will have years of use."
5,Adults and Kids Alike will LOVE This Toy,"Hopefully, Fisher Price will renew its focus on Kasey The Kinderbot, the robot that acts as friend and teacher to kids of all ages. I purchased three Kaseys this Christmas for children in my life, and all three were met with the sort of awe and excitement usually reserved for Ninetendo and X-box. This is a perennial toy that deserves great attention and support from parents and children alike. Fun, funny, charming and uncanny, Kasey is a charmer. Build on it with additional ROMs available from Fisher Price so that children of all ages will enjoy!"
5,LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!,"FP has really outdone themselves with this one! Gr* in every way`! Lots of different activities so it's gr8 for all ages. My sons (4 1/2 & 3) have spent countless hours with this. Thankfully, I was smart enough to but 2 of these-so no battles!Right now, my sons are both learning Spanish with Kasey!!!Just a side note~ my oldest son is mildy autistic and this toy has really helped to enhance his social skills. He loves giving Kasey ""five"" and singing and dancing with Chip.I would highly reccommend this to anyone!!!!"
3,Not very entertaining,"I don't usually write toy reviews but I have been reading several from others on other products, and I think this is a great way to inform those on a budget of what not to waste their $ on. This simply did not keep my almost 4 year old girl entertained. I have taken it out of the toy box several times to encourage her to play w/ it, and it simply bores her.Not worth the money in my opinion."
5,My son's Kasey,"I bought my son Kasey the Robot for his Christmas gift, since this is what he asked for. He loves it, and I like alot. It is very easy to use, it has many features to play, and they are all very fun and educational. My son has learn alot from him. I think that if you want your children to learn with enthusiasm, you should buy them the robot. It teaches them music, ABC, numbers, and opens their thinking skills. It's a really good investment for your children's future! After all, everybody saids that the younger you teach them the better they get as they grow older. I wanted to buy another one for one of my nephews, but they are out of stock! As good as this toy is, I think that they should have them always on the shelf, as well as its cartriges!!"
2,babyish robot toy,casey is the dummest robot toy. hes kinda handsome. hes way dummer than see and say. hes really fat. hes so ugly he dosent have a girlfriend. i dont know why he always teaches dumb stuff. i dont reccomend this because its so babyish
1,My boys don't play with Kasey,"My son received this as a Christmas present when he was 3. I also have a 5 year old son. My 3 year old has never shown any interest in this toy. My five year old has played with it briefly about 2 times. Kasey sits and collects dust in our toy room. I feel bad that Grandma paid so much money for a toy that has not been used by either of my boys. My boys enjoy educational computer games and I think Kasey was a little boring for them compared to the computer. To be honest, I found him a little boring compared to the educational software that we have as well!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM,"Don't buy this item....I juSt bought it and can NOT get anyhting for it because Fisher Price has DISCONTINUED this item as well as ALL of the cartridges!!!! I paid FULL price ($59.99) for this item and 2 ($19.99/EACH) of the 5 cartridges that were offered. When I called Fisher Price I was told ""Sorry Ma'am, there is nothing I can for you"" They have my money so they no longer care! DON""T BUY THIS KASEY KINDERBOT!!!!!!!!!"
2,could definatly be better......,"My 8yr old daughter LOVES legos. She was so excited to find a girls lego watch. She saved her money and waited anxiously for the watch. Unfortunatly it does not stay on well, is not designed for little wrists, and is very bulky. She wants to wear it, but it falls apart a lot."
2,Smaller than I thought,"This came within 3 days of ordering seperate from other items with free super saver shipping.Although the tiger is very cute, I was expecting it to be bigger. I should have looked more carefully at the measurements. :/"
3,"An unfortunately average, yet commendable attempt.","In ""Company Business"", writer/director Nicholas Meyer makes a commendable effort to create a tightly plotted, top-of-the-line Hollywood thriller, but the whole affair unfortunately falls flat. Plagued with the need for constant re-writes (due to the changing political scene in Russia at the time) and a rather uncooperative lead by Gene Hackman (who wanted to bow out of production a mere two weeks before principle photography began), Meyer was left with a screenplay that only sort of makes sense and a film that only sort of works. Some sequences are a hit (e.g. the opening caper sequence and a tense exchange in the Berlin subway), while others... not so much. I still enjoyed ""Company Business"", it's just sad to know how much better it could've been."
4,Cold War Type Action Revived,"Good guy spies, bad guy spies; good guy controllers, bad guy controllers. Oops, did the controllers just change and then change back again? Aye, there's the rub! Which ones can you trust? This film is definitely for those of you who can't get enough of a well-written spy story, and those who thrill to intricate plots that keep the viewer guessing. The name Gene Hackman certainly may be enough to sell you, and he's in top-notch form in this film, but add to that the surprise addition of Mikhail Baryshnikov turning in a marvelously credible acting job, and you have the beginnings of a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Cold War type spy films may seem passé to some, but this film totally captures the excitement and intrigue of the genre."
3,A So-So Spy Movie,"While I'm a big fan of spy thrillers, Hackman, and Baryshnikov, there was something missing in this one -- either a weak screenplay, lackluster direction or both. The result is a movie with only a moderate amount of real suspense.Both male leads (Hackman & Baryshnikov) and Geraldine Danon do creditable work in this mediocre spy thriller. I only recommend it if you have nothing else you'd really want to see or if you are avid Gene Hackman and/or Mikhail Baryshnikov fans. It's not one of their best either."
2,Baryshnikov and Hackman save the day,"I watched this despite bad reviews because I really wanted to see Baryshnikov in a feature film like this. And he does a great job. I'm wondering why Hollywood never offered him more roles like this over the years, since he's really quite good at it. Despite the chemistry of the actors, the movie is just very hokey and pointless. They try to make the story interesting by alluding to the extent of corruption within the U.S. government, but I think that's all common knowledge these days and not really that shocking anymore. I was amused throughout the movie that the CIA and Russia were upset about losing 2 million dollars, because I kept thinking of scenes in Austin Powers when everyone is laughing at Dr. Evil for thinking 1 million dollars was a lot of money... In short, this movie was just kind of juvenile and nothing extraordinary. Baryshnikov fans should be pleased though."
4,A technical view of the battles of the Revolutionary War,"I've gone through quite a few histories of the revolution, but this book is different in that it is written purely from the military aspect. The author doesn't critique all the battles but makes a representative selection from each type of battle.Each engagement is accompanied by detailed drawings showing the placement of troops, cavalry, and cannon. He discusses the use of terrain for each battle. In the case of the ""Battle Of The Cowpens"" he reflects on the purpose of the American commander in putting a river at his back was to prevent his soldiers from having an easy means of running away from the battle.All in all, a good informative read."
4,Neat Little Book,"Wood's book does not cover every battle or campaign, nor does it seek to, so those seeking a more complete study of the conflict will find this book lacking. However for what it is, Wood gives a clear, accurate description of a selection of the battles of the Revolutionary War. Perhaps not the most scholastically driven work, it nevertheless is a nice introduction to the battlefields of the conflict for students and general readers alike."
1,Hugely biased.,The authors use of words make the British Redcoat seem foolish and weak. If this book is meant to be about the battles of the revolution then why are all the American victories listed and yet not all of the British ones? Makes no sense to me seeing as the British won most of the battles.If you want to read a 'false feel good propoganda' type of book then feel free to go for this one BUT take everything you read with a massive pinch of salt. It's these type of books that have completely churned factual history into a euphoria of false patriotic rhetoric.Rebels and Redcoats will provide you with a far more comprehensive and factual base from which to look at the war from.
2,Battles Of The American Revolution,"I don't profess to be an expert on the American Revolution, however; I do specifically know enough about the northern campaign to realize that the Battle of Hubbardton did not occur in the State of New York as the index indicates ( "" Hubbardton, NY: battle at, 139-40"" ). It is the only revolutionary war battle fought within the State of Vermont. To me, such an obvious mistake puts the rest of the book's accuracy in question. Based on that alone, I won't buy it.P.S. In order to post this opinion, I had to rate this book. In all honesty, I would normally not have put a rating since I haven't read it. Sorry..."
3,Better Than Ringu.,"Of the only two Japanese horror films I've seen, Eko Eko Azaraku (Wizard of Darkness) and Ringu, I enjoyed Wizard of Darkness far more. I didn't find myself watching the clock as I did with Ringu and it seemed to be just the right length for this type of movie.Kimika Yoshino did a fine job in the leading role and is a fine actress. She grew on me more as I got further into the movie. Ryka Yuzuki was another actress I enjoyed watching, as she was probably the best looking female in the movie. She didn't have a very big part but the part she had was fine with me.Overall, no one stood out as a bad actor or actress, which is rare, but it was in Japanese so what do I know? I looked all right from my perspective.And finally, the plot wasn't too terribly original, but the movie did have it's own unique feel to it. I really couldn't find much wrong with the movie as a whole. 3/5 stars"
2,Boring Toy,"None of my 3 kids liked this toy. They simply did not care! I think a regular ball is more fun than this. If you leave it on and it's tippped ever so slightly on the sensor part inside, it will sit there and go off everytime you walk by it. OY."
4,Dynamic & Progressive,"I do Event Productions, and I use several of the pieces for some of our 'writing' or 'contemplation' or 'planning' segments and sessions. It's refreshing to find good non-vocal background music that can speak to your senses and a wide range of emotions and moods. Thanks Ralf!"
5,The Best Sushi DVD yet.,"Finally, a DVD , a book and a Bamboo Rolling Mat kit. Steven Pallett makes it so easy for the amateur to learn how to make sushi. The presentation is clean ,organized and explains the whys is making sushi (Why use Japanese Rice, Why do you need to wash rice several times, Why you need a long sharp knife,etc.), not just -""do this because you have to..."" instructions. Making sushi requires timing.Books can not teach you timing that is why the DVD is a big help for serious sushi fanatics. The is the best sushi video I have seen. There is another good sushi DVD called Ken Sushi Volume1 (there seems to be no vol.2) but Ken is not too articulate plus there are some typo errors and gaffes in the shoot and edit of the video which makes the production amateurish."
5,Lebendige Vergangen heit: Richard Tucker ll,Richard Tucker had an amazing voice! This CD is a great testament to his genius.
5,Benny Carter,To be able to hear one of Jazz great Sax players with the greatest pianist and his sidemen is a great treat.
1,Just don't do it,"Massive, Zebra is one of the hottest artists in the dancehall right now, but this album flops. Only two songs on this album are decent (The first song and the last). Massive, you'll do alot better just buying a compilation cd with Zebra and other artists. A big disappointment, trust me."
1,But is it accurate?,"Following is the review I left on another web site: So far I found 2 errors which MS confirmed: page 4, definition of UTP; and, page 17, max segment length 10base2; these are the errors I caught with my limited knowledge; my faith in the accuracy of the book has been undermined. I find this frustrating because I was looking forward to reading this book; I am now afraid to commit to memory anything I read within it."
2,Incorrect construction,"I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer. This particular model has problems. Firstly, the sizes are not true (actually somewhat larger than indicated). Secondly, the sleeve construction is about two sizes smaller than the size indicated. I agree with the previous reviewer on this issue."
4,The Essence Of The Series,"I may be somewhat biased with this volume. I absolutely loved it. Secret Panel is one of the few volumes that revolved around a solid structure - that of a ""spooky"" mansion right in Bayport. Aside from While The Clock Ticked no other volume deals with such a thing. The book was swift paced from beginning to end and had some pretty creative cliff hangers that dealt with a revelation rather than predictable violence as was the case with The Arctic Patrol Mystery. The criminals are elusive in this one and the brothers actually rely on sleuthing to figure this one out. Great book RATED B+"
2,Special Forces,"I've been a Mortal Kombat fan for many years now. I'm always excited about new Mortal Kombat releases. However, this game really disappoints. The gameplay is just too simple and the story lacks depth. Believe me save your money for something better. Subzero mythologies was way better."
3,Decent book on PPP.,"I don't think I would go as far as to say this was the definitive work on PPP, however, it did do a good job in explaining PPP and the world in which it lives. Being a beginner, I was looking for more instruction on how to install and manage PPP on my Linux box. It barely fit that need. If you want a good reference book, then by all means, buy it. But if you are going for a deep tutorial, then look elsewhere."
1,"This was NOT a Steven Seagal type dvd I, liked !!","I, choose a 1 star rating because it was NOT the kind of TRUE Steven Seagal DVD I like, it's more like Sci-FI.I, would only recommend to people who like Sci-Fi DVD's, but not to people who expect to see Steven Seagal in ACTION."
1,get it right,I was wondering why this one still states it is a Seagal DVD.. Buyers beware... read the reviews...I didn't and ended up giving this one away. It wasn't worth sending back.
1,Moon in my Room?,"The text fights off any sensible reader and answers the question, ""If kids are afraid of bears, what are bears afraid of?"" with a simple example: cloying rhymes.Illustrations are very cute, making me wonder if this was designed as a TV show that didn't quite make it to the tube."
1,Poor quality.,The suction cup did not stay on the wall and the radio did not work. The light never goes off.
1,0 stars not an option,hung for less then 5 min. fell. it was broken in the package. listen to the reviews. worst item ever its my 2end one. dont buy pos
1,0 stars not available,"This mirror sucks. First use, fell two times and fogged over. Do not purchase! Did not try radio, what's the point."
1,junk,"A so called ""fog-free mirror"" that fogs within minutes of the shower running.The clock is terrible and keeps horrible time, within days it will lose hours or add hours, have to constantly reset it.The light doesnt even work, press the button and nothing happens.The only thing that was working properly is the radio but that didnt long as the whole unit fell off the wall thanks to the junky suction cup, now nothing works and the unit receives no power."
2,Fog free mirror,"I really like the radio part of this, but the fog free mirror was definitely not fog free. As soon as I turn the shower on it would fog almost instantly. I ended up having to take the batteries out because the light that was suppose to auto shut off would stay on constantly."
2,It's OK,"The ""lighted"" feature is completely useless. The light is aimed wrong and doesn't illuminate anything. Though the mirror is good with fogging, it isn't a very good one.The LCD Clock and radio is a good touch, unfortunately I don't use them.Maybe the makers should've just concentrated on the mirror....maybe made it magnifying or just a little bigger."
1,Don't waste our money.,"I bought the mirror at about $30.00 for a Christmas present for my husband. The suction cups kept the mirror up for about a few hours after that it kept falling off the wall. The clock broke because it fell. Then we hung it a different way and not even a month later it is like a regular mirror. It fogs, what happen to fog less mirror!?! This is a rip off. Don't buy it. It looks like it is cheaper that in the picture. Total disappointment!"
2,barely functional. barely,"The mirror works. It is fog free.The clock does not work. It resets every time the radio is turned on and off.The radio is barely functional. It only picks up the radio station that has a super-strong, super-close signal. 95% of the local radio stations cannot be picked up."
1,Worst Piece of Garbage I ever owned,"This is the first time i have ever written a review, but this piece of garbage is so bad, i had too.I Received this as a xmas present. The suction cup fails occasionally, and when it falls, things break on it. The batteries wont stay properly seated in the compartment, so i gotta smack the hell out of it to get the light on. The radio, used to work til it fell.But those are just novelties, i really cared about the mirror itself. Fog Free? are you serious? that lasted about a week, now it gets so fogged i cant see anything in it.. DONT buy this POS."
3,A Little Misleading,My trainer recommended that I use L-Carnitine to help with my workouts and weight loss. The product does work. I have increased energy and can really push myself on my workouts harder. My only problem with this product is that they advertise it as 500 mg but they don't tell you you need to take 2 pills for that amount. In essence what you have is a 250 mg product so instead of 90 servings you have half that amount. So the cost of this product is not as economical as I first thought.
4,GOOD SUPPS,"These are great suppliments. I have never heard this brand before. But, now I take 1-2 AFTER my workout. They seem to help in joint and muscle ache and fatique."
2,it doesnt worth it,"if u read the supplement carefully, u will find that 500mg means 2 pills, which means 1 pill only contain 250mg L-carnitine. It is not worth it, not that ""cheap"", just use the topic to cheat u to buy it"
2,powernutra,I saw no results from this product.I dont really like trying to take something an hour before a meal .Busy people dont have time to watch the clock before eating.
4,Amazing product,While I can't attest to it's fat burning capabilities it definitely helps with muscle fatigue and soreness. If I have any complaints is that I'm taking 9 pills a day and it burns through the bottle in no time.
1,No cigar,This seemed to give little or no benefit. I switched to NOW brand Acetyl-L Carnitine. I really did notice a difference. I would suggest doing a Google search.
3,Watch Storage Box is a poor articulator,"The watch box itself is a beautiful piece of workmanship however for the price, the manufacturer should have spent a few more cents on hinges that hold the top open and a clasp that isn't so inexpensive. Hard to believe that a burled wood box as nice as this one chinces on the hardware."
5,Watch Box Storage Chest,The box is of high quality and my watches look great in it. Good value for the cost.
3,Poor proposal structure with good elements,"With the fantastic reviews I had high expectations for this book, and was sorely disappointed. The advice given in the book is worthwhile, encompassing and I found good concepts, yet was also disappointed with the lack of things like bid/no bid processes. The test for any proposal advice given is how good the final proposal is. This is a guide that results in a narcisistic self focussed proposal that has an outdated look and feel.In my oppinion ""Persuasive Business Proposals"" from Tom Sant is far superiour, and has been the basis for proposal processes in companies from GE, Boeing and downwards.You can get good elements from this book, but don't use Bob Kantin's templates. If you do the work make sure you end up with a good updated proposal template in the end. This is not it!"
5,Novice or expert this is a great guide,"Don't be fooled by the title. This book is a complete guide to building high quality proposals. What appeals to me the most are the pages relating to selling value. Sales Proposal Kit for Dummies incorporates not only the building basics, but what material is necessary to build the perfect proposal. The templates are great, easy to use and more importantly, easy to understand. This book is must have for any sales library."
3,Something is wrong,The price was good so i bought a few of them. the shave is great for the first 3-4 times after that it needs to be replaced. never faced anything like that where you need to change the razor maximum every week if you shave every day.
5,Gillette Fusion Manual Replacement Cartridges (8 Cartridges),"This is exactly what it says it is. It was shipped super fast. I would recommend this to anyone, these are great razors, my boyfriend swears by them. The deal you get on this versus any other store out there, is outstanding. Even walmart couldn't beat these prices."
1,Less expensive elsewhere,"Amazon used to carry good deals on these 12-packs. No more. It is now less expensive to buy these at Walmart. Also, I would echo the concerns voiced by others that the quality of these blades aren't up to snuff with the store-boughts."
5,Shave as Close as You Dare,"This product gives the best shave ever. There are 5 blades, all parallel to each other, which is the secret to the close shave. Each blade is sharper than the one above it. The first blade, which is the least sharp, functions to pull the hair out of the follicle a bit, then the second blade cuts the hair and pulls on it some more, then the third blade cuts some more and pulls the hair out even further. Finally, before the hair can snap back, the fourth blade moves in, and cuts the wily hair to infinity. My theory is that the fifth blade is just a marketing ploy and it really doesn't do anything. So, if you are willing to spend the money for the closest shave ever, buy this product. Or, if you are out of work because of the economy, you should get a Bic razor from Wal Mart."
4,Good blade,"I don't know about those who say ""only four uses""... I use one blade for two weeks (14 uses)...Anyway, I like the smoothness of the cut of this blade. It's really nice. My only complaint is that the blade is so fat (wide) that it's hard to get those tricky places, like your moustache under your nose.Great product, and I do agree, that once you are a ""Gillette man"" you are always a Gillette man. :)"
1,Fusion,"Did not received the product, so I can not provide a review! Can not rate the item either, but had to select something?"
1,It has 5 blades. Who cares?,"They are constantly looking for new ways to increase the cost of shaving. All they can do is add more blades. From one to two to three to four to five blades. What is next? I would imagine a 6 or 7 blade shaver. Then 10 or 12. It is utterly absurd. Save your money. You can get a nice close shave using a one blade, cheap disposable shaver. Just take your time and be careful. You'll save hundreds of dollars, though."
2,Glad I didn't pay for it,"I had a Fusion handle and blade sent to me by the Gillette company to try. I have to say that I am thankful I didn't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I've ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for ""precision"" is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What's next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that ""Executive Look"" ?"
1,Package not sealed,They came in a package that was not sealed. I find this unacceptable and dangerous. I am not even going to try them
1,Painful Experience,"These Razors must be factory seconds. It was painful to use the blades. They were course and hurt my face. I did not get a clean Gillette Shave. Felt like old blades I would have thrown out, but they did have new green ruber indicator strips. I ended up throwing them away. Not the usual Fusion Experience. I tried to order these online because I thought I could save a few bucks. I might still try ordering them from amazon, but never again from these guys."
1,Getting burned,"I tried this but it was not working out for me, and had lot of issues. I was getting cuts and burns. The Fusion Proglide Power was ideal for me once I changed. No burns/cuts with Proglide power. (Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Cartridge 8 Count"
4,"Good Razors, Reasonable Price for Subscribe & Save.","PROS:1. Good quality razors, for my wife, daughter, and myself.2. Price is reasonable, if you are on subscribe & save plan.CONS:1. Pricey if not using Amazons ""Subscribe & Save"".2. Can find cheap at your local discount stores.I used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval. I hate shopping at the brick & mortar discount stores."
3,Seem not to last as long as in past,They are great at beginning and naturally so wiith use \they appear not to last nearly as long as beforeThere is such a large choice I wonder if some versions betterthan others
5,Blades,The price was good the blades work great i would buy them again and recommend them to friends buy them
4,Gillette Fusion Manual,"These are good razors and a grate value, but there just not very good on my neck gives me bad razor burn other than that they are grate..."
4,Gilette Fusion Razor Blades,I really like the Gilette Fusion razor blades. The only thing I don't like is the price. Razor blades have gotten really expensive. None of the ones I've tried have lasted as long as the Fusion blades. But even they should last longer for my pocketbook.
1,Discount_Drugs_Inc should be removed...,They cancelled the order for no other reason than they didn't like the price they advertised.
1,COUNTERFEIT,"These are, hands-down, undeniably, without a doubt, counterfeit blades.The construction on each blade is cheap, so much that the individual detailing blade does not exist. It is simply a hard edge of the blade housing.Upon using a fresh, clean, new cartridge, it feels like running a rusty can across your skin: scratchy, irritating, cheap.THESE ARE NOT GILETTE.I am seeking what further steps I can take to hold Amazon, LLC accountable for selling me a fake item that poses a risk to my health."
2,"Some are good and may give up early, not lasting long!","Being a long time Gillette razor user, I've come to find out that blades can last either five shaves or as little as three before it starts jerking your whiskers out and leaving me with razor burn. All I can suggest is find a better blade and try using a Schick Titanium blade. I've had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves which is saying a lot because I have one very heavy beard.Gillette; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business!"
3,OUCH - GOT A BAD CUT,"Ouch, my hubby got a very bad cut (the worst I've ever seen) after putting in a new blade. He really likes this razor and blades and the shave it gives him. Once he got past that one incident, he has been pleased."
2,not the best,There have been a lot of fake blades going around on the internet from what I understand. I'm not sure if these were or not but I can say that they were not good. The blade was shaky and buzzed when I turned on my razor. (I have the vibrating style) And the blades seemed like they were not in the right place as they felt like they were jagged and cutting me.I can't recommend this product and will go back to buying my razors in Duane Reade or CVS.
4,Easier than finding someone to unlock the hanger so I can buy them in the store.,"As the title says, this make my life easier. I just buy them from here when I'm running low, and they seem to be the same product that you get in the store, as far as I can tell... The price is about the same, and I save on gas and time by not driving to the store and then waiting on someone to unlock the hanger."
1,bad razors,"The blades appear are either defective or bootleg; meaning that they are knock off brands. Possibly made in china somewhere. These are not the real thing, and I want my money back."
1,57Johnnie,Buyer beware. I do NOT believe these are by Gillette. I bought these and they absolutely do not work as well as the real thing. The first thing I noticed was a broken seal on the package. The first cartridge broke in half when removing from the holder. The worst part is that the shaves are terrible. It feels like shaving with a tweezers. It is my opinion that anyone buying these will get ripped off. This is my first rip off when buying through Amazon so I will continue to use them.Note: I previously obtained Gillette Fusion Cartridges through Amazon from DAB and they were fine. These came from toponeenterprise.
1,Something wrong with these blades,Not sure what's up. I have used Fusion blades for several years now; they have been great. Bought 2 packs of 8 from this dealer and they all felt very dull. Gillette replaced 8 of the 16.
1,Bad copies!,"I've been a faithful user of Gillette razor blades and replacement cartridges for many years! But, these replacement cartridges are the worst Gillettes I've ever used! The blades are dull big time, some cartridges have missing blade strips, the lubricating strip is green all the way (not green and white underneath), the orange color of the metallic part surrounding the trimmer is a darker than on my usual Gillette Fusion cartridges! I am pretty sure (200%) that these are copies, bad copies probably made in China! This is unacceptable! I got them from AllTheTimeWholesale through Amazon; I will no more buy my Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges from them! What a scam!"
4,As expected,"As expected, the product is the same as I know. The package is a bit cheap, not like the one you get when you buy at the store, but it's not important."
5,"Just like the store, but cheaper",The title pretty much says it all. If you can order enough and ahead of time to get free shipping they're same as the store but cheaper.
5,"Great Deal, Great Razor",Love the razors.. Been using them for three years now. Always smooth results..and the price is unbeatable. You will not find it cheaper anywhere else.
5,My Mans Fusion Razors,I bought this for my boyfriend as far as I know he loves this product for saving his head. He doesn't buy anything else so I bought him some for Christmas...
1,These are not real Gillette blades!,"These blades are counterfeit! I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens. It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off, versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens. Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream. They are just plain fakes. I tried this test with 4 of these blades, and the same result happened every time. They are just plain fake!"
1,Something's Not Quite Right,"Either Gillette puts in their best blades into the the handle package, or these are fakes, but they do not work half as well as the original blade I got with the handle."
3,Fusion blades,I don't think they work any better than the mere two- and three-bladed cartridges of the past.
3,GOOD - BUT - Outrageously EXPENSIVE,"These Razors / Cartridges are of excellent QUALITY, but for a disposable item RIDICULOSELY EXPENSIVE...!!"
1,Be very careful,Be very careful - I ordered it and I am sure I got counterfiet. Amazon was nice and refunded but if you suspect something wrong report to Amazon.
2,FUSION BLADES,I have been using gillette products for 40 years. These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp. You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don't last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves.
5,Great Blades,I have used Gillete for over 50 years and these are the best blades yet. Wouldn't use any others. Outstanding
3,It's just okay,As the rating I gave says: it's okay. Not a replacement for the high-end better-performing 5 blade razors from the leading brand. The shave was not as smooth but just ok enough.
4,Gillette is like the mafia of shaving blades.,"Once you're stuck with Gillette, you're stuck for life!!!! OK so yah this new blade system they got going on is nice. It is a nice shave. And the first use or 2, it doesn't feel like shaving cause it's that smooth. But really that's it. You only get maybe 4 shaves out of each blade before you have to switch. Unless you LIKE looking like a bloody mess. Expensive - Gillette has a death grip on all American men. Cause the stuff works that good but they charge you a mint just to get the goods. I like it, I'm a user, but arg there's no way these are worth so much money."
1,Seems like knock-offs,not as sharp as the one you buy from duane reade... these will give you cuts and burn.. will not buy again
2,Too expensive,"These blades shave me well, but only last me 6 shaves at the most.After one year's use, this would cost me about $180.I have therefore bought a high end electric shaver for the same price.I only shave with these for special occasions.Easy!"
4,As smooth as a baby's bottom,I think that the Gillette Fusion is the best disposable shaver on the market today. All my friends and family have complimented me in how good my face looks. I highly recommend this product.
1,Defective Lubrastrips,"I had previously been very satisfied with this product, but my first, and only, 4-count package from Amazon had defective ""Lubrastrips"" that curled, leaving sharp edges that could cut facial skin -- and did. The strip was still mostly green, indicating that it should have been good for additional shaves. The strips on all four blades in the package curled and one fell off. Perhaps there is a manufacturing difference in the blades sold here versus in stores, or perhaps it was just a bad lot. I would've given the blades I purchased in stores five stars for sharpness and longevity.See the user loaded photo of a blade with a curled strip (if Amazon hasn't removed it, again)."
4,OK,"I ordered a 12 count of these razors. I've used Gillette Fusion Razors for years and always bought them at a brick and mortar store. This time, I figured I would save a little money and ordered through Amazon. The ad pictured a sealed pack of 12 razors. Well, I received my package today. Eight razors were in a sealed Gillette box and the other 4 were received unwrapped. I'm pretty OCD about personal hygiene and to me, this is kind of disgusting. I have no idea where these exposed razors have been.Seller did refund my money, although he only needed to refund me for the 4 razors. Therefore, I changed my original 3-Star Rating to 4 Stars.Thanks."
1,Pure JUNK,"Do not trust this vendor, these blades are pure junk. I bought these in September, and finally got around to using them today (I buy these in bulk and these finally got into the rotation). These blades are dull, and do not lubricate the face when used. I suspect these are fake Gillette blades due to extreme poor quality. Since I bought these a few months ago, I have no way of returning these for a refund. So I lost my money on these junk blades. When a deal is too good to be true, it is.DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES, THEY ARE FAKES AND WILL RIP YOUR FACE OFF WHEN YOU USE THEM."
3,Good but way too expensive,"I regulary buy this product because of the single blade that's located on the back. It's great for doing line-ups on your beard. Thank god you can get this product a little cheaper on Amazon because they charge you an arm and a leg for this product anywhere else, and you don't get much use out of one cartridge; about 4 uses, like the previous poster stated. Hopefully, one of Gillettes competitors will come out with a similar product that's competitively priced."
5,Quality Worth the Price,"My wife and I both use these razors, and we both love them (I for my face and she for her legs, in case you were wondering). Women's razor cartridges never seem to be very good, according to my wife, so she tried using mine and much preferrs it. She said it shaves smoother and the blades last longer.don't bother with the powered razor, this works just fine"
4,Wish they were cheaper...,"Haven't tried the power version, but the manual blades work well. I just wish the pricing on this product would go down-- waayyy too expensive."
4,Great for everyday shaving needs,"I am quite picky about my razor blades, since my neck can be cut by a razor pretty easily. The Fusion has completely eliminated the problem of my razor nicking my neck. Though there are five blades, the way they are spaced creates dramatically less pressure on your skin. This results in a nick-free, incredibly close shave.In addition to the five-bladed front, a single blade is on the back to allow for fine trimming, like the edges of beards and sideburns.The one downside of this blade is that it tends to do less well if you let a few days' worth of whiskers accumulate; they tend to get caught up in the blades. You can avoid this by shaving every or every other day, or using another razor or trimmer to cut the whiskers short and then use the Fusion to finish them off.For those of use who will be shaving every day though, the Fusion is our blade."
5,ALL is well,"the product is what is said about it,ALL new,NIB,,and a VERY good price.will buy again,,"
4,A ladies review.,So I as a young women I have both the gilette fusion and the Mach 3 turbo...both work good but the blades don't last long at all!!The aloe strip is gone in 3 uses or a little more..these 2 are definetly the best razors that I have ever triedas of yet...
1,"don't buy these, they will rip up your face",These blades ripped up my face. The blades very rough and hard to use even with lots of shaving gel and prep. These are absolutely worthless. Try something else.
1,Knock-offs!,These are knock-offs. They HURT! The blades aren't well aligned and look different from those in locally bought cartridges.
1,The blades I received were fake.,"The blades I received were fake. No serial numbers on blades and the construction was shoddy. Felt like rubbing sandpaper over your face, very painful and very poor shave."
3,Great shave but way too costly,"When I first used the Fusion, I thought this was the greatest shave I've ever had. It actually felt like the blades had taken off a layer of skin. Not to the point of pain, but a feeling I've never had before. Clearly the 5 blade system offers something others don't.Then came the realization that the shave went downhill after the 3rd use. The lube strip was virtually gone and I didn't get the great shave I had the first time I used it.3 shaves and I can tell a difference. Are you kidding me? No my beard isn't rough or super thick. But I'm not going to swap blades out every 3 or 5 days just for that great feeling of the 1st and 2nd shave. I've tried all the tricks to keep the blades in good condition and can not keep them sharp past a week."
5,Great Blades at a Great Price,"If you use the Fusion razorblades this is a great price for 8 blades. The packaging is a little more generic then what the grocery or drug store carries. They still come in the cartridge so you can load them into your shaver holder (they click into the back). Unlike another review stated these are NOT imitation blades, these are the real thing. Exactly the same as what you get at a brick and mortar store, just less packaging at a much better price."
4,"fusion razors, the real thing","like many customers I hate how expensive these razors have become. So I have bought some off of ebay but have since read that I may not be buying the real Fusion blades which may explain why they don't last two weeks for me. I decided to give Amazon a try because this looks like the real deal, and not a knockoff."
5,Great Shave from Gillette Fusion,"Before I tried this razor, I didn't know what to expect. After all, how many blades does a razor need? A world of ""hype"" had made me cynical. Well, the Gillette Fusion blade is worthy of the hype. It does what it is supposed to do, give you a great shave, and does it better than any other blade I have ever used. That's it. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. No hype!"
3,"I like it, because it is cheaper than the same brand at the store...",This product is cheaper on Amazon than the store...however I find that in general these razors wear out very fast!It seems that I only shave my face 5 times and I need to replace it!Any suggestions on how to remedy this problem?
5,The best out there!,"I went back to my old Mach III for a while to save some money and things I have noticed -- shave is much better and closer, blades last longer, skin looks great after shaving. I also purchased directly from Amazon and didn't have any problems of having any knock offs. Also, the easy packaging is helpful as well. I hate getting the big boxes and have to cut them open with concern of cutting myself."
4,Getting my money's worth,"At the time I began to shave (which I consider the bane of being a guy but look forward to getting done for the sake of looking professional, pleasing the lady, and not having a scraggly beard or whiskers), I've always wanted to shave as close as possible and not cut myself while shaving. (I've always looked lousy with a mustache and/or beard.) No razor blade is perfect but the Gillette Fusion is good enough. I refuse to pay prices at the supermarket and drug stores or go through all the madness of getting it cheap at Costco. The best bang for the buck and to save time is to get them via Amazon."
4,Good for the money,"This was good for the money because since they are disposable cartridges they don't last as long as I would like them to. I use hot tap water and that destroys the metal and wears away the protector strip by the second use. But if you use cold water it will work a good four, maybe five times"
2,Thought I was getting what I used to buy at the store....,But I must have read the description wrong as I thought I was getting the Fusion Pro-Glide blades. I will use them till they are gone but they are not the same as the Pro-Glide blades nor as comfortable on my skin.
4,Great razor...,"I've been using Gillette Fusion razor blades since just after they were released. They are miles better than the old Mach3 blades.With my beard, I can get about 3 weeks out of a blade before I need to replace it. I've also tried the Fusion Power blades. They lasted a little longer... but I didn't feel the performance was enough to justify their additional cost.Speaking of cost... man are these blades expensive! My advice - use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program and buy the best per blade deal. It's not like they're going to go bad before you use them!"
1,Poor Quality,"This is not the same quality i buy from the store, somehow it looks differrent in packing. i tried to save some money but i guess it was not right decision. i should not recomend to buy online"
1,Not Fusion Proglide manual cartridges,"This Gillette Fusion (manual) cartridge currently appears in search results for Gillette Fusion Proglide (manual) cartridge.While it indeed *is* a Gillette product, it's sub par when compared to the Fusion ProGlide manual cartridge."
5,The Trio at its best,"Oscar in his prime. Nobody can and will ever be able to do what Oscar did.As somebody who studied piano, I can tell the energy and endurance that goes into this kind of playng. Add to this the improvisational ability, and you get magic. I highly recommend the CD."
4,Delightful movie and good songs and dancing,"This is a delightful movie, of course for the whole family. The singing, music and dance are all here plus the romance puts a delight next to Artie Shaw Band music. Paulette Goddard is sure sweet to watch and does a good dance w/ great Fred Astaire. Burgess Meredith makes a great 'partner'. The main reason I did not give it a five star is a personal preference - I am not too fond of folks 'doing the dirty trick behind one's back' which The two main guys do all thru the show. It does give for some good laughs/chuckles (I just don't like anyone doing that in life, movie script or no!) Yet as stated, gives comedy and it is the script for the story. Paulette takes it in good humor until it starts messing up her life, also. They all work together for a good purpose and bring it all to the good in the end! Enjoy! Even the guys should like this one, mainly because of the humorous side of the 'pranks'!"
3,More Getz monotonous,"Stan Getz plays a fine tenor. He pops up in virtually every bossa nova album that there is - you just cannot escape the guy. He is invasive, that is to say that, not content with playing his own solos he 'helps along' the other soloists, filling in gratuituously and very loudly while they are singing/playing. I have played in many groups and there is an unwritten code of etiquette that you don't just blow loudly when it's someone else's solo. He's overpowered Astrud Gilberto's beautiful voice on many records - just can't wait for the soloist to take a breath and he's in there honking. He's got four tracks in this CD which is why I only rated it a 3. The remainder is fine music played by unselfish musicians."
5,Garfield through history and in a lot of styles,"i have the video of this book and it is so cute and fun that i tracked down the book. it is wonderful. the art work, not just by Jim Davis is impressive and goes through several styles in its story telling. the Babes and Bullets vignette is not to be missed."
5,Brilliant interpretations of Garfield in different forms,"I read this when I was little, but the images still resonate with me. Some are fun and familiar (like Cave Cat) while others are zany and trippy (such as The Garden). But, the ones that really stuck with me were the dark tales, The Experiment and Primal Self. If you were to read those separately (as with a few of the others) you'd never know this was a part of Garfield. They are very active and violent, unlike the lazy, lasagna eating fellow we all know and love. The ending of the book is also somewhat existentialist, something else you wouldn't expect from Garfield. Well, maybe you would to an extent. All-in-all this is an excellent book and any Garfield fans should really read through it at least once."
5,I think it's the best Garfield book ever written!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""Garfield his nine lives"" is the best book ever written by Jim Davis. It goes through 9 of garfield's most exciting lives like cave cat, space cat, and detective cat. The wonders never cease when you read this amazing book. You'll filp when ya' see it."
5,My son loves Earth's Best,"We've been buying these in bulk for months. My son loves these apples, and if there is another food he is not enjoying we just mix in some of these apples and he gobbles it all up. It's a Magic Mix-in!"
1,garbage,Here's an idea: how about we make a 2 sided tape that sticks to everything except what it's supposed to? It sticks infinitely better to fingers and the actual backing of the 2-sided tape than it does to the window sill or the plastic sheeting.At first I was happy that it was so cheap.....and then so furious I wanted to burn the package. never again.
1,Rip off,"This product might work, IF the tape that is provided with it stuck to the wall for longer than a minute. Even with the recommended ""set"" time of 15 minutes, the tape does not stay."
2,"Film is fine, tape SUCKS","As other reviews have indicated, the film works just fine, stretches nice and clear, etc. but the tape is garbage. Do yourself a favor and just buy a roll of 3M double-sided tape if you're going to buy this kit."
1,This is Crap!!!,"I purchased four boxes of this brand...I will be returning 3!! The one box I am forced to keep, I will need to add another layer plastic of some sorts! This product does not work well! The quality of the tape is a JOKE! The scotch tape my children use for their arts and crafts projects is at least 50% stronger. I am very disappointed in the results I have experienced and would not recommend this brand if it were to only option on the market. Just to make the plastic stick, I have had to use packaging tape! In the process of using the packaging tape, I have ripped the cheap plastic...an all around mess!! Do not waste your money on Frost!"
3,Need a couple inches more width,"We've used this type of product for years, and this brand went on fairly well. We had cleaned the metal trim with rubbing alcohol before applying the tape (we got a lot of dirt off doing this) and have no problems with the tape sticking. My only issue is that at 110"" wide, it just exactly fit our window and luckily we had it pretty centered to begin with, but even so we were sweating as to whether we'd have enough to stick. Another couple of inches in width would have been helpful, especially due to the bulge in the middle where the door handle is."
1,Waste of money,The tape that comes with the film is useless. It does not stay on the windows or even to the film. Don't waste your money and buy the 3M brand instead.
1,Horrible product,"I've been using this product for about four years (because that's all that my local Home Depot sells), always with frustration. The tape is useless. If you're really lucky, it might stick for a half a day. After that, you're using packing tape, and wondering why you spent so much time initially trying to make the whole project look nice.I just ordered a bunch of the 3M tape and plastic, given its far superior reviews. We'll see . . ."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!!,"I've been using this product for years and have always found it to be the best....longest lasting, best protectant, easy on the finish. In recent years, it doesn't seem to be as widely distributed at regular retail outlets so I was delighted to find it on amazon. The vendor provided great service with prompt shipment and a fair price. VERY PLEASED CUSTOMER!!!!!"
3,sleeves are short,"I ordered XL because I didnt want the shirt fitting skin tight even though a tight fix maximizes wicking. I prefer a looser fit. the body of the shirt fits fine, 5 stars. but the sleeves are short. not like a short sleeve shirt but when I hold my arms straight out in front of me me ends of the sleeves are up more than half way up my fore arm. if I had ordered L I wonder if the sleeves would be up past my elbows. the fabric feels nice and is warm. a 5 star product with a star taken away for each sleeve that is too short. perhaps they are supposed to be short, but I cant imagine why."
1,NOT A THEARMAL,"These are NOT a true thearmal. This product mught have a purpose for a under the jacket wear, but it's actualy COLD to wear on its own with a T-shirt over it. I tried to sleep in them & it was amazingly COLD when my arms would touch the cold part of my bed, or comforter. I think I was warmer without it. Out in my shop I tried to wear these with a T-shirt on top & it was just FREEZING! My arms felt colder than if I just had a T-shirt alone. It's almost like it does the opposite of what a thearmal should do. Maybe under a jacket or sweater it helps in some way, but I don't like them at all. I feel I wasted my money."
2,Sleeves are way too short,"The sizing runs a bit small, potentially because of the spandex, but one thing that is way to short are the sleeves. I am a 36 chest and 5'9"", and ordered the 38-40 size because the 34-36 sleeves were too short. However, even the 38-40 sleeves are still short by at least a full inch. Get this if you are stout and/or short. Not advisable for slender people as the chest/arm length ratio are not for the slender or even average person."
3,Good solid,Not a thermal reallyMore like a warm topBut it kept me warm when I wore it with layersBut pricey
1,Do not buy.,No thermal value at all. I think I would be better off wearing 2 t-shirts. I work in a cooler all day and the only way I was warm at all was by working harder then normal to stay that way. They do breath really well so if you're sweating you'll stay dry. Great idea in a cooler. So as you move around the breeze from moving passes right through it and evaporates the sweat on you making you even colder. They don't even fit as they should. The bottom is loose and the sleeves are loose and they are tight in the top. I have other thermals that fit very well but these do not. I even went two sizes smaller then the suggested sizing because I new I did not wear an XL as their sizing said I would based on my measurements.Maybe I received something wrong because what I have is a very thin all nylon looking shirt that is about as thick as spandex and has the same slick feel. Nothing soft about it.
2,More like lightweight than medium weight,"The Veritherm underwear shirts we purchased for our son were supposed to be midweight. However, they were much thinner than the midweight shirts we bought at the local outdoor gear store, even though they were supposed to be the same brand, style, etc. Could there have been some mispackaging, or is someone misrepresenting the product? Anyway, if you are looking for midweight polyprop underwear, steer clear of this stuff."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Was supposed to be a mid-weight thermal. It is a very thin, light weight material with no thermal/insulation capability that I could detect. Also, I'm 6'0"" with average arm length, ordered a Large, but the sleeves are at least 2"" too short. This product, as advertised, is garbage. Not like my old Thermastat Duofolds that I love, and hoped would be similar to this product."
2,Comfortable But Not Warm,"As mentioned in other reviews these are made of very thin material. Consequently I found that they did not provide me with any real thermal warmth when I was stationary. I felt no difference in warmth between having these on as a base layer under clothing versus wearing the same clothing without these while I was stationary. They are stretchy and very comfortable however. My guess is that they would prevent one from getting cold during periods of activity by wicking away any perspiration from the skin. Since I needed something that would be provide warmth during periods of inactivity as well as during time of activity, I am returning these."
3,Product Changed/Did Not Receive What I Ordered,"I first bought this a few years ago and loved it. Ordered a new one and did not get the same thing. The fit has become smaller, and it is no longer tagless."
2,Definately a baselayer,"I am sure that is what Duofold had in mind is a baselayer.I bought two of these based on other reviews,but these are not what I expected.First they run small.Normally I wear a medium,so I bought a large and it is still very tight.So buy accordingly.Second,I bought these to wear under my work shirts as I am in and out all day long...make note,if the fabric gets cold,so do you.It is early fall here and the lowest temp I have encountered is 40 degrees.I went outside wearing this under my work shirt,the fabric got cold,so naturally so did I.Obviously I did not use the product correctly,as I believe under other layers and a winter jacket,it would probably help a great deal.For my needs,I'll just head back to the old fashioned waffle type long undershirt."
3,A Charming Recording,"A great album of Holiday songs. Very understated and great for background play, this album also provides for great listening enjoyment. Billie's voice is complimented expertly by the musicians utalized for these recordings."
3,Bad video quality,These videos look like they have been ripped from video tapes. The color is off and video was shaky on my screen.
5,The Beginning of Something Wonderful,"Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin remain the finest inventions of detective fiction; Chandler may have been a better writer, and Sayers may have been more properly literary, but Stout's books are the best as detective fiction. This is the first Nero Wolfe mystery--the characters aren't quite settled down into their comfortable places yet (and some of the members of the cast haven't appeared on stage yet--Lily Rowan doesn't appear until SOME BURIED CAESAR, perhaps my personal favorite of the series), and the mystery isn't Stout's best. However, Nero and Archie are there, and the sheer joy of listening to them and following Archie's narration are in full bloom. There is no particular reason to start with FER-DE-LANCE, but it's not a bad way to begin one of the most pleasureable creations (the series in full) of the 20th century."
3,Wolfe doesn't get snakebit,"This is the first of the Wolfe series, and my second (I started with The Second Confession). I love the snappy banter between Wolfe and Goodwin, and Wolfe's eccentricities. Goodwin enjoys jabbing at his boss at every turn, and I can just picture the fat, lazy genius who refuses to get out of his chair when a lady comes to his presence. Wolfe scores a zinger early as he figures out the method with which Barstow is killed. The latter part of the book was dissappointing. We figure out the killer way too early, and the ""suspense"" ends up trying to figure out Wolfe's plan for the finale. Once we got there, I was stunned - surely Wolfe could have planned something better than that! Yes, the killer pays, but I expected Wolfe to come up with a cleaner way of disposing of the case."
1,Disgraceful,"Bantam was in a hurry to monetize their Nero Wolfe license and did not even bother with a basic proofread. The printing is littered with mistakes. Some are just annoying; others completely confuse and alter the meanings of important sentences. Since the writing is from another time, phrases and phrasings are different; thus it becomes difficult to tell whether a sentence is strange because language has changed or because some idiot at Bantam couldn't be bothered to pull her finger out of her nose long enough to do a classic justice. Possibly the worst offense is that the back cover blurb needlessly reveals a major plot point that happens towards the end of the book. I will NEVER buy another Bantam book again. You shouldn't either. These illiterates shouldn't be printing PennySavers let alone a classic of detective fiction that still sells robustly and enjoys a healthy popularity. Disgraceful."
5,Excellent!,One of the best Rex Stout ever wrote. Very ingenious plot and interesting characters. A pleasure.
5,Nero Wolfe rocks!,"Excellent old school mystery. Snappy dialogue, well crafted plot, dympathec characters. I lan to buy the rest f Stout's Nero Wolfe books."
1,The starting point for all critics of Marx,"This book has some virtues, in terms of clarity of exposition, but as a reading of Marx it leaves a lot to be desired. Like Jon Elster's attempts of making (non)sense of Marx that followed it, this text reads into Marx a set of assumptions taken for granted within neoclassical economics but entirely foreign to Marx's work. If you want to see how Marx and Marxism measure up to the unquestionable and seemingly unthinkable criteria of bourgeois thought, read this. But if you want to understand Marx, read Althusser. 'For Marx' is a good place to start, but be sure to read the essays collected in 'The Humanist Controversy' and 'Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists' too, not to mention 'Reading Capital' and 'Machiavelli and Us' ... Cohen may be easier to read, but only because Cohen doesn't challenge any of the ideology of capitalism that is as invisible to most people as water is to the fish that swim in it."
2,OK but not great,"It's a fairly readable book, but there are quite a few errors.The book is strongly based on the open-the-loop method to find loaded Q, but this method is heavily flawed due to the impedances where the loop is broken being not known."
1,a sleeping pill,"Like other Rhea's books, this one put me to sleep after a few pages. I tried again when I woke up, and I found that Randall's verbose style is poor and technically inaccurate, to the point that his book is confusing at times."
2,Technical book purchase review.,"High Performance Linux Clusters with OSCAR, Rocks, OpenMosix, and MPI (Nutshell Handbooks)The main issue I found is that the purchase was mislead. I was trying to buy a hard copy and they gave me a kindle copy instead without warning!"
4,I Never Promised You A Rose Garden (used book),Product arrived promptly and in the expected condition. I am very satisfied with the whole transaction. Only it's too bad I have been too busy and haven't read the book yet.
3,Nylon balaclava,"Had to launder it when it arrived, odd smell. No problem with that.You need to have a nose bridge as it squeezes hard and flattens your nose and it HURTS!Other than that, it was what i wanted."
3,Balaclava,"This product fit the description, however there were a couple things that sucked.ProsThe Opening can be pulled up over the bridge of the nose or pulled down onto the chin, This is nice for Airsofting as i wear a half face mask, I have full coverage without having to have this AND my mask covering my mouth/nose.NeutralThe mask is uni-size, I have a big head and it fits OK, would be nice if it was a little roomier so i could put a generic beanie cap or something for more padding from headshots in Airsofting.ConsI have only washed it once so far, but it seemed to not hold up to washing very well, The colors are bleeding, As it was it didnt match my Camo very well, and now that its faded it matches even less, Its not terrible, but kinda dissapointing. FYI i washed it on cold but did have a long cycle (large load)"
4,Great for those morning rides,I got this recently for those cold mornings on my motorcycle and I must say its an amazing way to stay warm at highway speeds. The fit is a bit tight so if your head is larger than average it may not fit yours despite the one size fits all rating on it. Slips on easily and easy to clean. I wear this almost every day that I ride my motorcycle in the winter. One downside other than the possibly small fit is that the stitching goes straight down the middle of the face and can press into your nose if worn for extended periods of time. I would recommend this to anyone looking to stay warm on a motorcycle or just those cold days. Great product
3,gets stretched out,I liked this balaclava but it wont keep my nose covered. You constantly have pull it back over your nose because the material slips down. Seems like they cut the face hole too wide.
3,it is a xmas present,"everything is fine, other than the option of other colors. I would have liked to have this in black or brown"
3,"it's ok, but not as good as the black.","I bought it with the black one, this one feels like a different material, more uncomfortable, less ergonomic, more like a poliester than a Nylon.The colours are ok, and it doesn't fit on a big face."
1,Very Small,"Very small product. If you have a small Child, then this will work for them. Normal Adult, pass on it."
2,Balaclava,It works. But is super tight. I wear a large helmet but this is really snug fit. I lost my old one which i believe was cotton and fit better. It fit more like a sock. This one fits like a wetsuit. tight. It smashed my nose down when i ride. Before you buy make sure you want a snug fit balaclava.
4,Fursuit,"This mask is being used for the base of my fursuit head. It is on the tight side, wish it was a little more loose."
4,Good for what it is,"I bought this several weeks ago and it's held up reasonably well. The sticking has come undone somewhat, the shipping was free but it took a while, and it pushes down on the bridge of your nose. If you can get past all these shortcomings then it is a great product."
3,Tight fit,I don't consider myself to have a very large head but I found this item to be quite tight. I know you don't want a loose fit but this is almost uncomfortable but luckily my commute is only about 20 mins. It is also not too terribly warm. The ear protection that I was hoping to get just simply isn't that great. I am going to be searching for a better alternative.
1,is not ONE size fits all,"I purchased this after losing my Under Armour Tactical Hood, which fit with plenty of room to spare and was perfect for eating or drinking without needing to remove the whole thing off. When I first pulled the package out I noticed right away that it said ""fits most sizes"" and knew I would have a problem. I tried putting it on and my head had trouble fitting thru the neck area. I finally got it on I noticed the stitching goes right down the middle of your face and the stitching rubbed against my lips and figured it would irritate my lips if worn for a long period of time.If you wear a 7 1/2 or larger fitted hat or have a 22 1/2 inch or larger head I strongly suggest you find another Balaclava as this will most likely not fit."
2,Not too impressed,This balaclava was purchased to use on my 30-40 degree bike rides. It was too tight on my jaw and made breathing distracting. I have a smaller head too. It was not very warm. There is stiching down the center of the chin and is chaffs a bit. Disappointed.
1,under helmet,"Made in china,it is very thin and poor quality. I do not recomend it.i boght it form my motorcycle helmet ."
1,"Way too small, childrens size","I have 2 balaclavas from zan headgear. I bought one years ago at my military surlpus store, it fits great. The one I ordered from amazon.com is significantly smaller. It says one size fits all but that's a lie. False advertisement."
3,Great.,Great for the price........will look at others to see if I like them also.Very satisfied so far with this one.
5,Awesome Ninja Headgear,"I would recommend buying this for cosplaying a ninja and such (that is the reason why I bought it). For those wondering how far down the neck portion goes, it actually goes far, even for large heads.If you are looking for a balaclava for skiing, I would recommend purchasing a more expensive one because the fabric is thin; it wont keep you warm.My only complaint is that you can slightly see through the balaclava once it is worn. It's not too noticeable but it happens. However, for such a low price, this is worth it. I plan on purchasing more."
2,"Looks like the picture, but it is paper thin","For the price, what do you expect (I suppose), but there is NO WARMTH in this thing. It is just a CAMO cover for you head while playing in the woods, but that is all it is. It is wafer thin (but decently made), and will provide no environmental protection of ANY kind... so don't be fooled. It is not for Skiing or cold weather protection, just for decoration."
5,Just what I wanted,"Thin and breathable, long enough in the neck and tight around the face. It's perfect for snowboarding, the reason I bought it."
3,nylon mask,"one size does not fit all if you are like me, an average adult male. this fits like a small when it should be a large."
3,doesnt fit my face very well,"for the price i cant complain too much, but it doesnt fit my face very well. im not a big guy, 5' 8"", 160lb, and its a pretty tight fit.the open portion goes pretty wide, but again, you cant expect a perfect fitting high quality anything for $5"
4,"Very warm, great price!",When I received this product I wondered how it was going to keep me warm being that it was so thin. I needed something that would fit under my helmet though and this did the trick. I rode with it outside in 20 degree weather and it did the trick. Kept the wind out of my face and even knocked down the decibels of the wind a little bit. I could still breathe fairly well. Some string has come out of the bottom but other than that it has held up. I've worn it many times and haven't washed it yet. I should probably do that. By following the instructions it looks like it will stay together fine. I usually don't dry these types of things. I can fold it up and stick it in my pocket in-case I don't need to wear it just yet but want to have it just in case. Great product for it's great price!
5,works well,Have an older Werner ladder (model 6056). This pail shelf fit perfectly and performs flawlessly. Wish I had discovered it earlier. Fully recommend.
5,helped my family!,"This book has helped me in raising my own kids. It contains theory about children, as well as practical application for helping children through the difficulties of life.Great book!"
3,Groundbreaking When It Was Published...Just For Scholars Now,"1st: This is an old book and needs to be treated as such. When Pirenne wrote this book there was no archeology, arch. has changed the way people think about the transition, and most of what P says can be discounted by looking at arch. 2nd: Havighurst's book, despite its title, which makes it sound really helpful, is out of date and not worth looking at. 3rd: You don't actually need to read thisbook to get the argument. Read David Whitehouse's ""Moh, Charl and Origins.."" and that tells you what P says quite quickly. That's the only book you need. However, it was published in 1983, and newer sources (see McCormick) should be considered for any scholarly undertaking. This is an ever growing field, and new archeological evidence appears every year."
4,A 'must have' for Late Antique scholars,"Pirenne's is considered a cornerstone of the history of the roman empire and late antique european history. Although his theories about the causes of the decline of the roman empire are being hotly debated, the book sets the foundation for anyone trying to get an understanding of the history that leads to what we now call western civilazation."
5,A wonderful addition to our Christmas collection,I received this book today and I was not disappointed. It's a lovely sweet story with an 'it's better to give than to receive moral'. The illustrations are beautiful and unusual. I know this will be a favourite in our Christmas collection. A must have.
5,Sweet story to share with a child,"""Shall I Knit You A Hat"" is a charming story about kindness and giving. The illustrations are adorable. The relationship between mother rabbit and son is sweet and loving. I love to cuddle and read this with my daughter on chilly winter nights. Oh, and a wonderful bonus is the knitting pattern in the back!"
3,"Nice, but easy to damage watch","This watch was a very nice one. But I didn't like a couple of things:1)circles on a bracelet are not bended for a hand curve, so it looks a bit angular.2)A clasp is not very safe.I had this watch for 4-5 months. One day a clasp opened during a walk, and I lost them.3)The mineral glass is very scratchy. I damaged it almost a couple of weeks after I got this watch.All other watches with mineral glass I had were more durable.But.. still. if you are not gonna have anly one watch in your collection and like to wear brand watches this one is a nice deal."
3,not really impressed,"First, there were too many disks to keep track of, and unless you knew what you were doing you had to keep changing CDs, because CDs were split by land rather than by plot. The controls were a bit awkward, and it wouldn't let me get all the treasures because of this awkwardness. The enemies became either too hard, or too easy (there was some weapon that you threw at one of the jungle creatures, that killed them in 1-2 hits). Then I got stuck (literally) in this one cave, and I never played the game again."
1,Not that good,"Just the top part vibrates; the bottom part of the brush does nothing. Also it just vibrates not rotate or spin. I feel like it does nothing more then give a nice hand massage. It is just like a normal toothbrush, but heavier and eats battery. Not worth even this cheap price."
1,Very Expensive Sports Bra,I purchased this item because I read some great reviews on it and because I needed a really good supportive jog bra. I was not happy about paying over $50.00 (with shipping) but I figured it had to be top of the line for that price. I received my bra and it was basically an overpriced sports bra that you could buy at your local walmart. It was very uncomfortable and it was huge. I had to check the size to see if I received the correct one. I don't know if I received the wrong product but I was shocked to read the reviews and then to get such a low quality item for such a high price. Between shipping and returning it cost me $15.00 and I still have no jog bra..ridiculous..
4,good support but awkward to put on,"I have taken up running and needed a supportive sports bra for my C's! This champion max. support definately helps reduce motion and is adjustable on the back strap with hooks and snaps, as well as the shoulder straps with velcro. Felt comfortable to wear but is a little tricky to put on, unless you do the ""fasten in front and twist"" option. Ordered thru amazon from Lady grace who sent it fast and in good condition."
5,noxzema continuous clean,"I have never used this as a face cream as others have so on that end I can't say how well it works, however what we use it for are to put on mosquito bites, poisen ivy,tick bites or anything on your body that itches. This stuff is the best on the market to take away itching and bring you comfort so you can get on with your life. Don't bother with calmine lotion or any of the Hydrocortisone creams because they only work a little to bring comfort, buy this and give it a try and I can promise you will never use anything else again!"
3,Was this product repackaged?,"I'm not 100% sure that I'm reviewing the same product shown here. The one I have is labeled Noxzema Citrus Scrub with Vitamin C. The packaging is very similar but has a clear section where you can see the product. It has the same ""tingly citrus formula"" tag line. So take this with a grain of salt...The actual product is disappointing. I wouldn't really call it a ""scrub"", although you can feel a few particles of grit in there. It's more of a soap. It does have a very pleasant scent, though.If you're just looking for a gentle face soap, you might like this a lot. But if your primary goal is to exfoliate, I would look elsewhere."
5,precious children's book,"Gave this to children, parents, and a school volunteer. So far,a neighbor child was thrilled. He came over with a hand-made picture for his thank-you."
4,Words beyond compare,"I purchased Ounce, Dice Trice because it was acclaimed the only grammar book a child would ever read. Being a stickler for good grammar, I thought this book would be the perfect gift for my grandsons. I read it first before passing it along and it is a delightful book about words. I enjoyed reading it but a grammar book this is not. It introduces the reader (child or adult) into exploring word usage while having fun with it. I think their advanced promotion was misleading."
2,CUTE TITLE ... NOT AS FUNNY INSIDE,"When I listened to the author being interviewed, I thought the book was hilarious ... The interview was funnier than the actual text! A little disappointing!"
5,Chidhood Favorite,"I remember this book from my childhood. My mother used to read it to me and teach me to read. I could only ever remember one line from the book: "" Ram Tam Gee Pickagee is feeling good""Having a copy of the book is like finding an old friend on facebook."
5,Loving the sound of words,"This is a book to read aloud to small children, and to have the older brothers and sisters take over reading aloud to the younger ones. They will all surely fall in love with words and the sounds of words, even nonsense words !"
2,"Unfortunately, I can not recommend this book...","Although I appreciate the amount of effort required to write a book, I simply can not recommend this one. The book describes unimportant or familiar concepts (like the traditional relational model) in too much detail and new or important concepts (like the Oracle8 object extension syntax) in not enough detail. Many of the diagrams do not appear to relate to the topics being discussed and the examples are too few and far between. I felt that the author used terminology inconsistently or at the very least did not define terms adequately. One might argue that the book is about object-oriented design and not about Oracle `syntax' but if you want to learn about OO check-out books by Booch, Jacobson, Fowler, Rumbaugh, Wirfs-Brock, etc. If you want to learn about Oracle objects try ""Oracle8 Design Using UML Object Modeling"" by Dorsey et. al."
5,Great for the designer who wants to advance to Oracle 8,"This was just the book I was looking for! A well written, easy to read, technical book written for Oracle relational technicians and designers who want to advance into the object-relational and object oriented paradigm. Interspersed with elucidating diagrams and SQL syntax, the book gives the reader a high comfort level with the new Oracle 8 constructs such as Varrays, nested tables and methods. The author introduces each contstruct, clearly explains them, and then presents ideas as to how to apply them in business applications. In later chapters, after overall data base design is discussed, chapters are dedicated to method design, a discussion on available design tools, UML, Oracle 8 and data warehousing, SQL3. Once finished, the book leaves the reader with an excellent handle on Oracle 8 and how to design data bases in that environment."
3,Do you like a book with incorrect sample codes?,"The introduction of this book claims that ""valuable information can be found here"" (sample case study, chapter 8). What I found is a bunch of incorrect sample codes everywhere in the book. I expected this book will address how well Oracle8 support ORDBMS. Instead it makes me wonder if the wonderful object oriented design concept presented in the book can be implemented in Oracle8 or not. Not a well edited book."
3,I have founded many errors in this book,I have founded many errors in chapter 8 of this book and I want to contact with its author
3,Weighted Brush still too Light,It's hard to purchase a heavy vacuum brush by internet. This one is just okay. I'd like a heavier brush with slightly longer and tougher bristles. Having said that it's not defective it's just not what I had hoped for.
2,Not very smart design,"Read the other negative reviews. I had the same problems. Suction would only be effective if you lift the vacuum and place it directly on the mess. Otherwise, the bristles would just spread the garbage before the suction in the center could get to it."
4,Power Pilates,"It's a good CD for teaching a Pilates class. Upbeat, but not too over powering. The music does not get in the way of the verbal cueing."
3,Old recordings not that well transferred.,"As per the title I found the sound not as good as expected. The technician did not take care to process the original recordings to a standard expected in these days of technical expertise,"
3,Great Music - Bad Sound Quality,"This album is great as all the previous reviews mention - and the music is excelllent as described. However, the sound quality is pretty bad, mostly it's the pops and scratches of the 78's these were recorded from (as noted in the CD literature). I am quite accustomed to listening to 78's and generally don't mind all the typical noise that comes from their wear and age, in fact I even like the noise as I feel it really adds to the quality of the 'old sound' of the music. In this case though all the pops and scratches actually impose on the music, often competing with it, at times even distorting the quality of instrumentation. Such a shame for such a lovely selection of music. I just have to believe their is some way the recording engineers could have reduced all this noise, from the sounds of it they didn't even try. Buy this at your own risk - it is music worth having, but be aware of the noise impositions that vary from moderate to worse from track to track."
2,Not a good Clancy - Wild Card,"Unfortunately, a badly written story. Not one that I would recommend. I read everything that comes out from Tom Clancy, and I am generally happy - from satisfied to delighted. This time, not, even though the plot was quite interesting."
1,One of the worst books I've read in years.,"This is just another of the low quality books put out under the ""Tom Clancy"" name.The book is written by Jerome Preisler and is by far one of the worst books I've read in some time.The plot is very poorly defined, and is so poorly followed that 1/2 the time you are left trying to figure out how a chapter fit into the rest of the book.Character development was minimal at best, and completely missing at worst.There were two main plot lines that had virtually nothing to do with each other, and trying to follow them simply made the book unreadable.My advice is that you don't waste your time on this sell out of a ""Tom Clancy"" novel."
4,Don't Buy This Wheel,"Wheel doesn't work on GT3. You can get by on WRC and have a little fun but wheel is unacceptibly twitchy and impossible to hold in a straight line. I am buying a different wheel and taking this one back ASAP. Can't understand how anyone could give this a good review. I'm not some kid, but a middle aged adult who expects a little bit more quality than this for my money. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
2,Get something else!,I am disappointed in a wheel endorsed by JR.... You can't set the sensitivity. You you find yourself turning the wheel 90 degrees for a 45 degree turn. For Nascar thunder series it works a bit better than the analog controls for anything else its not worth the 40 bucks to get. Find another race wheel!
4,v thunder racing wheel,"I really don;t know why they gave this such a low stars. When I first bought this I said this was great the grip is nice the petals are pretty cool. It has worked with all the games I have tryed. My favorite game to play with this games are Grand Turismo 3, midnight club street racing, and grand turismo 2.I think this wheel should get more stars."
5,great,i dunno wat evrybodys sayin that the pedals dont work because they work fine for me and wit all my games including gt3. this product is great definetley get it.
4,ps2 wheel,"first of all, this is good. i gave it 4 stars because the pedals dont work with gt3. this wheel works 4 need 4 speed high stakes, smuglers run 1 AND 2, the simpsons road rage, midnite club street racing(hello) and the wheel, not the pedals work 4 gt3. There are proably alot of other games it works with, i dont no..."
4,101-Title is descriptive,"Finally a book that covers Oracle Networking starting with the basics. Don't expect a definitive work, but it's a great place to start. Simple explanations that don't assume you already know something. But as you would expect from a ""101"" book, some descriptions are a little vague or get a broad brush, particularly the 8i features."
4,"Coffee, Coffee and More Coffee","""The Joy of Coffee"" by Corby Kummer, 1995, 1997, 2003This is a rather amazing book. Mr. Kummer starts with the growing of the coffee bean, harvesting, and ends up describing the selection of the various beans for blends. The truly interesting part is that there end up being so many beans that are usable, or maybe that is just my reading of it. The beans are so variable coming off the tree, and the processing is so intricate, I was surprised that we actually got some coffee. Another thought was the need for exporting all the quality these countries can. They are so cash poor they have to sell all they can to provide for the economic system. We are sure lucky here to be able to enjoy the fruits of our labors without worrying so much about the money, so far."
5,Fantastic,"Of course there are some tracks that aren't very good, but all the good ones are so good the others don't matter. The German edition has a bonus track ""Your Disco Needs You (German Version)"", which is like the original version, except instead of the French part, which is in German. Also features Password as ghost track after YDNY (German Version). Get it!"
1,Short tracks!!??,"What's with the short tracks, seconds??? Something seems to be missing here. Wasted my money."
5,first cirlce,"This was the first PMG title that I bought and remains one of the finest work by PMG after hearing a wide range of his stuff. Like all of his CDs he does not overkill the album with solos and the ones that he does use are immaculate. Mays' piano is spot on and the Bass, is both harmonious and cutting funk. The disharmony of Forward March runs into the tab-clear drumming on Yolanda You Learn like snow on ice and the acoustic rock finale, Praise, culminates in a spiritual overload . . . FRESH."
5,Timeless Jazz Masterpiece!,I've listened to this masterpiece since I first got the album--back in the days of the vinyl LP--and it still sounds as fresh now as it was back then. A timeless work of art!
5,The second of many great albums!!,"With the exception of ""Forward March"", this album is outstanding!! I love ""Yolanda, You Learn"" and the title track, which was a sign of things to come with his ""Secret Story"" CD with his orchestral arrangments. This album is a must for any Pat Metheny fan like myself!"
5,PMG's finest album,"In recent years my ears have been assulted with so-called ""Smooth Jazz"" (an oxymoron to say the least) which usually consists of a Saxaphone with electronic bass and drums. The good thing about this is that it raises the First Circle to an even higher status. A few days after this album was released I was driving down the 405 freeway in LA, listening to the local jazz radio station when the title track started to play. I had to exit at the nearest offramp and take in what I heard as I was totally stunned by the beauty of this composition. Never has a piece of contemporary jazz had such an influence. It also confirms that Lyle Mays is the most underestimated musician in Jazz. His ""less is more"" style solo on the track ""First Circle"" is partly responsible for the beauty of this major work."
5,Possibly the most powerful album I own,"The First Circle concert at Northrup Auditorium in Minneapolisremains seared in my mind EVERY time I hear this album. Lyle's pianobreakaway durning ""First Circle"" brought the place to its feet and an ongoing chant of ""Lyle! Lyle!"" commenced for about five minutes. It is one of the most thrilling works of piano ever. When combined with that voice...that beautiful South American voice discovered by Pat on a cassette tape while he was traveling, well, I have to keep pressing the rewind button to believe what I heard some 15 years later. Pedro, you're the man! I use the title track and ""Praise"" to run and the treadmill goes fast when these tunes arrive."
5,One of the best!,This ablum is the one that got me hooked on the Pat Metheny Group. It is one of their finest recordings. I would play this CD over and over at the record store I used to work at back in 1987. The group never gets old. Their music is simply the best!
5,Entertaining,I've been a Pat Metheny fan for a long time and have to admit there are a few pieces he's done that I frankly don't care much for. Some of his atonal works leave me scratching my head wondering why. The first tune on this CD actually got a belly laugh along with the sincerest hope he was through with the Zappaesk stuff in one track. It's fun and a little satirical once you figure it out.The whole album (CD) is a joy to listen to. Pat Metheny paints images and takes the listener to magickal places with each album and The First Circle is no different.This album is interesting and a true pleasure to listen to no matter what your musical preferences. Very few composers are able to invoke vivid personal memories that can make you laugh out loud one moment and then find you lost in your own private retrospection five minutes later but this album (CD) will do that.
3,Greater growth,"3 1/2Almost all awesome album, highlighting a still-young artist's distinct fusion capabilities, can't quite hold the same power its title track and plenty of scattered passages provide though remains a necessary intoxicant nonetheless."
3,decent but unexciting cd with an awesome last song,"I 'm a rock and folk guitar fan more than a jazz guy. I want to hear fretboard acrobatics, cool tones, innovative techniques etc. I understand that Pat Metheny is not a flashy (in that manner) musician.I also am fully aware that he is a musical giant especially as an arranger, band leader and explorer of different styles.The music is pleasant but nothing knocks my socks off except...The last song ""Praise"" is a stunningly beautiful song. I saw Metheny circa 1985-1986 and he played it full knowing how beautiful of a composition it was. It worked very well as an encore, show closer. The cd is worth the price just for that 4-5 minutes of utter joy."
5,This is the essential Matheny - his best,"""First Circle"" is, in my opinion not just Pat Matheny's best CD, but one of the top CDs in 'avant-Brazilian' Jazz. The reason for this is Pedro Aznar, as well as Lyle Mays' great key and synth work, and Matheny's inspired playing. Other than Aznar's ""Mas Alla"", Matheny's ""If I Could"" is the stellar cut and quite simply a devastating masterpiece. When I saw this band live in an intimate setting in 1986, they played the entire ""First Circle"" recording, then closed the show with ""If I Could"" and half of the audience was in tears - seriously. The entire concert, with Aznar being featured, was almost a lead-in to that last song. The rest of the songs on ""First Circle"" are all first rate and deserve the highest rating as well."
5,Important Recording,The beginning of youth jazz orchestras across the US. Get this recording if you are tracing the development of youth music.
1,Garbage,"This album is pure garbage, none of the tracks are credited to Bronze Nazareth. These appear to be tracks by Bronze before he got with the Wu. The beats are terrible, the rhymes are lackluster. I'd suggest if you're really in to Bronze get his solo album, the great migration, and his group effort The Wiseman. Those are the official albums you want to get. Don't get souped in to this garbage."
2,Where is Ware?,"I had hoped this book would have more about Chris Ware, but most of it is the author's boring observations about comic art and his theories about what Ware is drawing. I would much rather read about the subject's childhood, and especially the details of his time in art school and in Austin. Instead there's endless verbiage in the Scott McCloud vein. A few interesting reproductions of Ware creations I hadn't seen before are included, but not much else is worth recommending."
3,Great at this price,"A very high quality novelty mouse. It still works like a mouse. It must stay on a surface. The one annoyance is the trigger has about 3/4 inch of play in it. With a ""Trigger job"" (duct tape over the slot) it was perfect. It gave my wrist a much needed rest. Worth the $3 I paid for it as a daily deal."
1,Not what you may think,"I may be stupid but I thought this was a point and shoot controller when I ordered it. It is really just a mouse that looks like a pistol, pull the the trigger to click the mouse etc. I found no use for this device, maybe some would enjoy the feel of a gun in their hand when playing FPSs, not me."
3,Agree with the other poster.......,"Maybe I am at fault but I bought this thinking it was a ""gun"" that could be pointed and shoots for playing games. It however has to be used with a mouse pad and its akward trying to move around flat without lifting like that. I do think some will enjoy it but I pretty much have stopped using it after only a couple times. It is well made and a novelty type product.Take a normal optical mouse, flatten it a little and put a plastic gun on top. Now try to move it around."
5,Important book!,"Although somewhat out-of-date now, this is the only book that I know of that deals with this important problem. Pet theft is an increasing problem, and most thieves aren't looking for a pet of their own. I didn't think that there would be much of a market for stolen animals, but there is. After reading this, you will be wary of leaving your animals unattended."
1,"Great Fiction, Nonfiction at its worst","Judith Reitman uses half-truths and hearsay to help create a panic involving a mythological pet theft ring that simply does not exist. Interview every dog researcher in the US and find that pets are too high strung to be research subjects. Even if pets were available as research subjects, they would not be suitable. Reitman uses ""facts"" from long ago to substantiate a supposed problem today. She warns to beware of the pet theft ring, when in fact you should beware of Judith Reitman."
2,Extremely disappointing,"The first half of the novel is well done, and enchanting in places. However, plot twists often become confusing, and by the last chapter, we are led to the most implausible surprise-- that Mrs. Fairfax was somehow the evil queen in all this. Nothing in the entire novel prepared us for this, and thus, it felt completely contrived. Perhaps the author was trying to be gothic, but she failed utterly to convince this reader. I felt cheated of the true richness and emotional depth that is ""Jane Eyre."""
1,Pointless,If you read the book Jane Eyre you will soon understand the moral concept of what I am saying.When I bought this book I was hoping for a sequal. Instead Emma Tennant turned around all of Brontes work in to something awful and stupid. The worst part is they made Mrs. Fairfax the bad guy in this book. In Jane Eyre she was a good old lady servingthe house. But the way emma Tennant wrote the book she changed nearly half of what everything is supposed to be about.Also they rebuilt Thornfield. Confused? Look at the name. It was a place of terror that held to many memories that haunted people.
2,huh?,"While I liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent)."
2,Did she read Jane Eyre?,"It's an interesting concept, but if you love Jane Eyre, don't read this book. The plot is slightly confusing, but besides that, there are many small details from Jane Eyre that the author has either changed or seemed to miss entirely. I expected a romance, but instead, I found something that trashed the story of Jane and Edward Rochester."
2,I wouldn't bother reading it if I were you!,"I purchased and read this book after reading several other negative reviews because I'm stubborn. I wish I'd saved my money. The story is (I'm not sure I have the words to describe it)vague, disjointed. Even than doesn't seem like an adequate description. It's almost as if the author were hallucinating. . .it just doesn't make much sense a lot of the time. I'm currently reading ""Jane Eyre's Daughter"" and enjoying it much more. If you love ""Jane Eyre"" and want a sequel that you can actually understand, I'd recommend ""Jane Eyre's Daughter"" but ABSOLUTELY NOT ""Thornfield Hall"" unless you're in the mood for a psychadelic acid trip."
4,nice beginner's guide,"This book is helpful because it lays out the CI process in an easy way. I share this with others in my workplace since it can be read quickly and is easy to follow. I'd recommend this to others who are new to the field and want to get up to speed quickly about CI. For those already doing CI, you are better off picking a more advanced treatment."
4,A real workbook,"This was my first CI related book purchase - and it fulfilled my beginner needs. This book is formatted as a working aid in content and set-up. There are no easy answers here, but providing guidelines and example templates for organizing your work is the author's strong point. Reading this is as if you are a student in his class working through a complicated assignment for the first time.Bottom line - good for learning the basic rules and tools, but perhaps too fundamental for the experienced CI professional."
5,Film Noir 'Canon',This classic film noir (the category that wasn't) novel(W.R.Burnett) turned film is a cinematic masterpiece in the film noir 'gangster' subgenre. The futility and despair evident in those artist in the wake of McCarthy and the HUAC fiasco is masterfully crafted here. Sterling Hayden easily displaces Bogey as the Dark City tough guy. Lovers of film noir or those new to the scene will do themselves well to own this classic.
5,"Far Far Beyond ""A Classic Movie"" (An Example Of Karma)","Someone here wrote that this movie is showing its age. Nothing is further from the truth. A movie like ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn't come close to this serious movie. This movie has ""Pulp Fiction"" beat all to hell because the plot is more real. The acting is at a MUCH higher level. It's the strong characterization developed by superbly executed acting in this movie that sets ""The Asphalt Jungle"" above movies like ""Pulp Fiction"". Every character in this movie was 'done in' by his/her own foibles. This, is an example of karma, an Eastern concept that was used in pulp crime movies of that era. John Huston conciously emphasized that concept, karma, in ""The Asphalt Jungle"". You will not finde a better ""Crime Genre"" film than this one."
3,crime doesn't pay message,"The head bad guy in this movie is a crooked lawyerwho is having an affair with Marilyn Monroe.The jewel heist is well planned, but everything does wrong.Sterling Hayden is one that the action centers aroundand he is described as a small time hooligan.The movie is mad with class, but seems to be a ""message""peace about crooked cops and crime.I liked the movie, but couldn't give it topmarks because the characterizations weremostly like comic book cut outs."
4,Noir heist film!,"John Huston's noir-thriller is also a heist movie. When Doc (Sam Jaffe) gets out of prison, he has a plan for the big heist. He needs financial backing and a crew to help him. Dix (Sterling Hayden) is the muscle, Gus (James Whitmore) the driver, and Emmerich (Louis Calhern) is the financial backer.Dix is an embittered man whose dream is to buy back the farm his family lost. Doc is a cool customer, genial and intellectual, and always has a plan. Emmerich has a sick wife at home and a hot blonde (Marilyn Monroe) at his cottage by the river. However, crime doesn't pay and each person's vice is their undoing.This is a fine suspenseful thriller set in gorgeous, highly-contrasted black-and-white. The presence of shadows in each scene and the violent pessimistic script give this film a noir sensibility. Well directed and acted, this film also gives a true flavor of the 1950's."
3,Tough to follow,"My husband loved this movie, but the story was a little hard for me to follow. If you don't pay attention to each character from the very first scene, you will be lost. Marilyn Monroe is beautiful in one of her eariest roles."
4,"Top-notch crime film and for some , Huston's best film","Grim, ironic crime film with excellent performances (particularly Sam Jaffe and Louis Calhern)and direction by Huston that is right on the money. Very possibly Huston's best work."
5,Director John Huston scores big.,"As a criminal mastermind whiles away seven years in prison, he develops a plan for a huge and clever heist. On release he gathers a small group of experienced criminals; each person has a special talent needed in pursuit of this startling crime. The plan seems perfect, but soon begins to unravel in unexpected ways. The plot moves along in high tension, well worth your time."
3,I love Film Noir but I cant sit through this,"I am an old movie buff. I have seen almost everything Marilyn Monroe has been in I love Gun Crazy, The Set Up, Humouresque what is wrong with me? When I put the Asphalt Jungle in the first 45 minutes I go to sleep and its hard for me to sit through this film for some reason. Sterling Hayden and Sam Jaffe are fine actors and I dont understand it. I guess its not fair for me to type this review because I cant watch the whole film. Sam Jaffe is the only person I can really listen to and Jean Hagen who has a wonderful role that is out of type. Does anyone else other than me think this film is too slow?Confused movie lover,"
5,Musician of musicians!,"Thirty seven years after his death from a heart attack. Wes Montgomery still sounds so fresh, innovative and warmth. His arrangements allowed him to express his feelings with such originality and expression. Certainly you may establish analogies: Wes is in his jazz idiom, what Segovia meant to classical form and Hendrix t electric guitar.His velvet tunes and pleasant melodies loaded of joy, sadness but above all perpetual commitment. It is notorious his influence on ""musicians in process"" or ""musicians to come"". Georges Benson, Pat Metheny, Peter White or Russell Malone still possess a huge debt with that legendary artist who left us in his forty five, when the world waited for more and more of this charismatic and talented guitarist."
2,Disappointing product,"This birdfeeder has enough going against it that I wouldn't purchase it if given another chance. The central wire makes it swing much more in the wind, making it difficult for birds to feed on a windy day. Although the cover has a button to hold the lid in place, on windy days, the button doesn't hold well and the bird food dumps all over the ground. Also, the plastic windows aren't big enough and are barely held in place by the 2 metal clips that line the side of each edge. The plastic fell out when the wind blew my feeder off a really secure branch. However, at least it didn't break. So, overall, I'm not happy with this feeder and wouldn't recommend it to others."
3,attack of the squirrels!,"the feeder holes on this feeder are too big for small seed so i bought chunky stuff with nuts and fruit, nice idea and the song birds loved it. unfortunately so did the squirrels and grackles. the grackles got frustrated because they couldn't get to the food the conventional way so they began to fly at it (I swear) to get it swinging and dump the food on the ground. the benefit for them was that the top came off too -- easier access! the squirrels then promptly figured out how to pop the top as well. i have stopped using it."
1,Skip This One,Birdfeeder has a couple of design flaws that make it unuseable as far as our yard goes. The top does not fit secure on top (slips off with the slightest bump) and the press clip slide on the wire that releases the top to move up and down does not hold securely. Therefore... top is easily set askew when a squirrel jumps causing the feeder to lean to one side and stay there and spilling seed. I don't know how the reviewer can say that the seed doesn't spill. I lose about a cup of seed everytime the squirrel jumps on it. Cute feeder - bad design. Going to my auction box. Waste of money.
2,Pretty but flimsy,"This is a very attractive feeder, but the problems I have will keep me from buying another.The slide-clip opens with very little pressure - the squirrels pop it open every third or fourth landing.The wire hanger is close to breaking near the slide-clip.The slide-clip is a marvelous idea, but the application is weak.It is very simple to clean. The side panels lift out so they can be thoroughly scrubbed, and once they are out, the inside of the feeder is easily accessible."
1,Definitely NOT Squirrel Proof!,"I only had this up for a couple of days, and the squirrels quickly learned how to ""jump"" on it to make it swing wildly which causes the lid to come off (despite being secured) and seeds dropping to the ground. The squirrels then drop to the deck and eat the seeds, along with birds and chipmunks. Blasted squirrels!"
2,Smaller Than Expected,"Claims to hold 5 pounds, but holds maybe 2 pounds or less of sunflower seeds. I don't see how it could hold 5 pounds of anything. Plus, design allows birds to scatter a significant number of seeds on the ground. I'm also concerned about rain getting in through the large openings. I may try to block them partially. It looks nice, but I wouldn't order another because of the design."
4,"Very nice looking and blue jay ""proof""","Most of the little birds in our yard are bullied by a pair of nesting jays. This feeder works great in that vein as the jays just cannot settle on the perches or get a purchase on the sides. After a couple of days of trying they gave up and the little guys are having a good time with the feeder. It is attractive to look at and holds the feed without spilling.The only irritant is that the lid is not the most secure, and winds will move it around and cause it to not fit correctly in the grooves. Not a big deal, but it does require one to align it every few days. All-in-all, an effective and attractive feeder."
4,off balance,Excellent quality. Attractive product. However when lifting the top to fill with seed the body of the feeder tips a spills seed.
4,Outdoor friendly,Nice design with a large capacity for bird food. The perches are small enough to accommodate the birds but do not make it easy for the squirrels to hang on!
2,Tilts and empties all seed.,A design flaw in this feeder. There is no center bar to keep the wire from sliding into the corner. This effectively dumps the seed.
3,Good and bad,"This is a very attractive and very well crafted bird feeder. The problem I had with it was that the only place I could hang it was over my deck. The birds definitely flocked to it. But, they threw more seeds onto my deck and into my planter boxes, than they ate. If you could hang it from a tree limb, it would probably be ideal, because (I suspect) the birds would go after all the spilled seeds that hit the ground. Then, again, if the ground was covered with snow, the spilled seeds would be lost. So, I really wouldn't recommend it."
2,Spills A Lot,"The squirrels have not managed to get into this bird feeder, but they don't need to. It spills so much seed that there is plenty for them on the ground. It spills when I try to fill it. It spills when larger birds try to eat. It spills when little birds eat. It spills in the wind. If the seed lands on my deck, the squirrels get it after all. If it lands in a flower pot, it sprouts and I have millet along with flowers.It looks OK and might work if you have squirrels and have a place to hang the feeder where a lot of seed on the ground is not a problem."
3,Very pretty and well made bird feeder,"This is a very pretty bird feeder. My problem with it is that the squirrels figured how to climb on it and because the four feeding openings are so large the seed would fall to the ground. I found I was going through 4 lbs of seed each and finally replaced it with a ""squirrel proof"" feeder."
3,pretty but flimsy,"this is a beautiful feeder but I expected it to be a little sturdier. The plastic ""walls"" of the feeder are extremely thin and flimsy. I don't expect that it will hold up for long, but hopefully I'm wrong! Time will tell."
1,Poor product,We just received this and the lid comes off super easy and allows all bird feed to fall out. Horrible purchase!
3,Over Priced,This is a pretty chintzy product. First it arrived in pieces due to poor packaging. The windows are flimsy plastic that do not fit all that well as two of them came out during shipping. Easily put back in place however they all rattle. The feeding wells are not well designed. This was $20 and it is perhaps worth $10. You need to look for something better and/or less expensive as this one is not a very good value.
2,um what this is a horror movie,this movie was terrible. i only give it abit of credit because it has two guys full frontal. one beefcake model and a emo/musician. the camera angle and plot where the worst. nothin too good about this movie
3,vapid shallow models must die,"just like all the rest of them. there are a few """"pretty"""" parts.but no enought to make a great film.just invest a little more in the script and you will eventually makea decent movie"
4,Golden book,"Excellent second installment in the unforgettable, frightening, and fantastic trilogy. I didn't get to it as a kid, but having stumbled across a used version of ""The White Mountains"" recently, had to continue, and luckily found the rest of the series on Amazon."
5,Christopher delivers another suspenseful installment... read,"In the second installment, the battle to free mankind continues in an exciting new adventure. The heroes of the White Mountains return to uncover the true nature of the alien's that enslave mankind. Readers of the first installment will not be disappointed in this volume; as exciting and suspenseful as the first--if not more so!"
5,A fascinating blanket that is intricately woven.,"Step by step, this journey captures your imagination and captivates your mind even more. This is definately a page-turner. I started it and COULD NOT put it down. I love it when books do that. This is one of my absolute favorites and an absolute must-read!"
2,If you wany a good science fiction book do not read this boo,"I read this book and I found that, though the story idea was okay, the author used too much description and not enough action and wrecked what could have been an excellent book"
5,Outstanding!,"I couldn't let a negative review be the only review of this book. This is an excellent companion to the White Mountains, and builds upon the surreal sense of horror that is outlined in the first book. This series of books is a materpievce in youth fiction, and underlying all the action, suspense, and great plot is a complex philosophy of self-determination and individualism, concepts missing in today's youth fiction."
3,"Sturdy, but a little noisy.","I use this rack, with the corresponding Topeak MTX bag. It makes a sturdy and stable combination, although the spring rack is noisy on bumps. If I were to do it again, I'd buy the same rack, without the spring rack. I've never wanted to ride without the panniers, and the rattle would be reduced, without the extra mechanism."
4,I love it!,"This is a nice rack. The only reason why I do not give it a 5-star rating is because I would like a simple plate that I can attach pre-existing items to to carry on the rack. However, it does accept standardized bags. I since purchased a newTopeak MTX Trunk Bag DXP Bicycle Trunk Bag with Rigid Molded Panelsand it was a wise investment."
5,It's a rack. It holds things.,"It's attached to my bike and it carries stuff. It passes.The one thing you should know before getting this is that it's designed for bikes that bosses by the seat post for the arms to attach to. I think most modern bikes have these, but I had to ream out the holes in the arms so that I could attach it to the seat post bolt instead."
3,Not as universal,This is a good product that works very well but I did not have the required places on my bike to attach it and we ended up drilling holes in the frame of my bike. The screws were not the right size for my bike and this left me needing more nuts. I do agree that it seemed to be the best one out there and it is very stable and easy to use. I am thrilled with it just know that it may take some adjustments to fit it to your bike.
5,This Rach has been Awesome,It installed very easily. It has held up very well and it has handled everthing I have bungeed to it. Highly recommend.
4,Good rack,Overall does what it's suppose to do. The spring is not as strong as my older model but it does come with a rear light mount.
4,"Good price, convenient, but not for really hot days","Bought this to take my daughter to the beach.+ Takes about 3 minutes to set up and is very easy.+ Has larger side vents to allow air flow than some of the more expensive tents.+ Has a large mesh door to allow air in.+ Works well to keep biting flies at the beach out.- Wind can blow it down easily. I weigh down a few corners.- The nice, big vents allow a little bit more sun in.- Obviously, can still get a little warm. A cool spritzer bottle helps.Overall, very nice. For the price, you can't expect a perfect tent."
4,Easy to take anywhere,"This tent is great for playing in the house or taking to the park when it is really sunny out. The only downside I can think of is that if baby is learning to stand/walk, she wants to get in there and stand up, thus, it tips over. If this is your kid, make sure there's not anything sharp nearby the tent when it topples over."
4,it does the job,I brought this down to the beach for my 4 month old. It does blow away very easily but I just put my bags inside to keep it down. It served it's purpose and I was able to put the baby to sleep in it so he was out of the sun and wind. It's good for my [...] too. It folds up very small so it's easy to carry.
5,super fast shipping!,"I just ordered this product 2 days ago, and received it in the mail this morning! WOW! Amazon.com and Target have really impressed me with how quickly this made it to my home. I am planning on taking it on our beach trip at the end of July. I am impressed with the product thus far."
4,Good sun protection for the beach,"I bought this originally for our trip to TX is August. We used it as a portable crib for my then 10month old. It worked out well except that he wouldn;t fall asleep in it, kept crawling out. We ended up lying on the bed with him to get him to go to sleep, and then transferring him to the Lil nursery later. It did work out welll not to have to lug my pack n play on to the plane, as I was the only adult flying down with 2 kids (we met my husband there).We do use it all the time for the beach too. He usually eats lunch and plays a little while in the tent, and will crawl in and out. At this point he is really crawling everywhere so he doesn't spend lengths of time in it but it is still wonderful. I'm now expecting a new baby in April and a sure we'll use it next summer with him/her for naps, etc."
2,Not good for babies,"We took this to the beach and didn't use it once. It got warm inside it and my three month old would not use it. It may be better for him as a toddler or in the house, but not as a baby at the beach. We ended up using a bigger tent that I could sit in and hold him instead."
1,better products available,"This tent does what it claims to do, but it takes a lot of energy to put the poles together & set up the tent. If you use it rarely, or leave it set up, this really isn't a problem. If, however, you need to tend to baby while setting up the tent, good luck. Wait until there is a second person around to help you with the job.I found a slightly larger tent for a cheaper price at Fred Meyer. The one I found (I'm returning this one) simply pops open with one hand & folds/twists shut (like those round windshield shades)."
4,this tent was a very good buy.,This tent worked as advertised. It was easy to set up and take down. It provided a sun shielded spot for my Grandson but still allowed a breeze to keep him cool. Without this we would have had to spend way less time at the beach.
4,Good Value,"Tent is overall durable, EXCEPT you have to be very careful to not allow the velcro on the door to not touch the mesh used on the door and at the bottom of the tent for ventilation, otherwise it will cause rips and thinning of the material. Good value, great item for the price ( I paid $[...])"
4,Newborn + sunshine = need for this tent,"What do you do to keep a newborn out of the sun while enjoying spring and summer weather? Get this tent! It's easily portable, and goes up quickly - just like a standard sized dome tent. We learned how roomy it is the first time we used it: our 2 month old was stretched out on the floor of the tent asleep while our 2.5 year old and a 4 year old friend sat next to him and played. Yet the total footprint wasn't a whole lot bigger than the camp chairs the grown-ups were sitting in.The floor of the tent is a sturdy plastic - great for keeping out damp but not too comfy. No problem - just put a towel or blanket under sleeping kidlets. The only thing that kept this from getting 5 stars is the door. It closes with 4 tabs of velcro, rather than a zipper. I don't think the closure would keep mosquitos out or a determined child in. Other than that, I think the tent is great!"
1,UV rating?,"Contrary to the Amazon description, this play tent does not offer any UV protection. Nowhere on the packaging does it mention SPF or UV protection. Misleading and disappointing."
3,Not UV rated as noted in the description,In the manufacturer description it states this is UV rated. We just got this and nowhere on the box or in the manual does it say anything at all about any UV rating of any kind.
1,You get what you pay for,"For our first child we had the quick cabana we loved it!! It however only survived two years with an active toddler, two dogs and a cat. This time we opted for a cheaper version intended for the beach. It is awkward to put up especially on a windy beach. You have to watch the direction of the sun because sun gets through all sides. The vecro closure is a pain. To weigh the tent down we had to put our beach bag in it not leaving much room for our nine month old. If you are looking for a tent for little ones to play inside and intend to keep it up this is the tent for you. If you want a tent for the beach or just to be outside. Go for the quick cabana. We loved that tent and wish we would have spent the extra money. This tent for us has become a playroom tent. You get what you pay for. Wish we would have gone with the quick cabana"
1,Broke on 3rd usage,"This tent was actually great for the time that it lasted. Problem is that that was only 2 days. One piece of the flexing plastic poles that form its frame broke, rendering the whole tent unusable. Would recommend paying more for something more robust."
1,Portable Play Tent,"It was pretty easy to assemble, but we tried to use it for the beach with our 4 month old and it wasn't a success. It kept blowing away, wasn't 100% sun protection and it was hot inside. When it blew away we got sand all over the little guy - which was a BUMMER! It would be nice if it had little pockets on the side so you could shovel sand into it. For an infant and beach use, not the best purchse for us. Probably good for parks and when it is a bit cooler."
4,nice sun protection for baby,"We purchased this for our 7-month-old for our vacation to Crete. We really liked the sun protection it offered our little girl as well as providing her with an un-sandy place for her to play with her toys on the beach. It also fold up easily for travel and set-up it simple and fast. On very windy days it is not suitable (or safe), however. It is not weighted at all and cannot be secured to the ground so other than the weight of the baby there is nothing to prevent the tent from literally blowing away. Overall, it's a very useful product. We plan to use it for a few years to come."
3,Needs Zippered openings,"If I had realized it had velcro closures, about 10 inches apart, I would not have purchased this product, and did not realize I had clicked on the option to purchase with next day shipping until I received the confirmation email. Meanwhile I had found others I wanted, although more expensive. In print the Amazon site says no changes can be made on next day orders, so it arrived on time, as usual, but did not work for my purposes since it did not have a zipper closure. It has not been used but I paid as much for shipping as I did for the item, since I could not stop the shipment. I am otherwise very pleased with all other Amazon orders and shipments I have received."
3,Good for the beach.,"We used this tent in the Bahamas at the beach. It was good, and quick to set up when not windy. Our son played in it for about 30 minutes and it kept the sun off of him. It can be a little tipsy when he would stand up, but that's expected. Overall, I would recommend it."
3,My child too old,"I agree with another review written my daughter is 15 months old and Toys R Us recommended this toy for ages 3-36 months so I got it for her to get in and use when I go to the beach in a couple of weeks. I put it together to try it out and found out that the doors close with velcro. I put my daughter in and within two minutes she was out, which I dont think will be much help on the beach wish it was a zipper instead. It is however a good idea for little babies, I went last year to the beach when she was only 7 months and had to cart around the pack and play which was a pain and getting it on the plane was a pain as well."
1,Get another one!!!,The poles bent when I was putting it together. I have since seen tents that are easier to put together with one pull of a string. This is easy to store in the bag they give you. But I wouldn't recommend this product.
2,TIPS OVER - USELESS AT THE BEACH,"I hate to write a negative review...I had such high hopes for this little tent. But the truth is, there is no way to secure it in the sand or prevent your little guy or girl from tipping it over again and again.The tent itself seems very strong and well-made. However, the poles don't dig down into the sand, and there are no pouches on it to fill with sand to weight it down. From what I hear, the Infant Cabana from One Step Ahead (although more costly) is a much better way to go. I guess you get what you pay for.My son was able to play with his toys in this tent, but once he saw people outside, he was pushing on the mesh screens to try and get to us, and the tent just kept tipping over. Very frustrating and NOT relaxing at all. We spent a week at the beach and used it only once before we realized it was pretty much useless.If I had it to do over again...I'd try One Step Ahead. I've never been disappointed by them. Should've known better."
4,Gets the job done,I bought this for my daughter when we went on vacation to the beach. Its quick and easy set up. The only negative side is that it is very lightweight and could easily blow away while at the beach so we put all of her toys in there and it was wonderful. It covered her from the sun and gave her her own little play area and i recommend it to anyone going away to a sunny place.
3,Not For Active Toddlers,"This tent is easy to construct and holds togethers very well for the price. But I quickly discovered it was designed for younger, less active children than my 15 month old. First, she put all her toys into it and started pushing it over with one of her push cars, that seemed innocent enough, but before long she was in it herself pushing the walls and rolling around the playroom as if she was inside a giant gerbil ball. Foreseeable misuse? She also enjoyed pulling the poles out, so that she could wave them around and poke at things. If she could, my toddler would give this product five stars and title her review, ""Great Fun,"" but from a mommy's perspective, it was not safe. We had to take it down."
3,Good depending on your needs,"We bought this tent for our 11 month old at the beach. We decided to try it out in the backyard while we did yard work and in his room to play in. It's as sturdy as you'd expect with tent poles. if you jump on the top it will probably break the poles, but the pockets that hold the ends of them are woven and sturdy. It keeps him out of the sun while allowing the breeze to cool him. My only complaint is that the door is shut with 5 pieces of velcrow, not very effective in keeping the bugs outor the baby in once they learn they can lean on the door and the velcrow would come apart."
3,Easily tips over,"I was very excited to use this tent at the lake and our horse barn. We spend A LOT of time outside. However, after setting it up inside for my daughter to get used to it, every time she pushed against it it would tip over! She is pulling up on everything and well on her way to walking, so I could see this happening way too often."
4,Beach baby!,"We were able to take our 1 month old to the beach in Hawaii with no worries. We set our bags in the tent which ensured it would not fly away, and then set down our little boy in his Bobby. He napped mostly, but we were able to lay down (outside the tent, it's not that big) and play with hime inside the tent. It was large enough for me to get in with him to breastfeed and the mesh made sure it stayed nice and cool. Anyone who is afraid it will fly away, just put something inside it! Great value for the money."
4,Love It,This tent is great. It takes a few minutes to put together but is worth it because it packs up and fits perfectly in a beach bag (I like this better than those hamper type fold up tents which look bulky). The only complaint is the velcro door but at the same time it is easy to get to the baby. It is even great for the back yard.
4,Great inexpensive sunshield,This was great she just crawls right in it without a fight and plays!! It shields pretty good from the sun and was easy to set up
4,Sun tent,Tent is noce other than it hard to set up in the wind at the beach. Other than that we like it.
5,"FUN , BUT DOESN'T LAST!!!","This is an awesome toy, but only if you can replace it every six months. My son's conked out after only about 3 months of real play. He got it for Christmas, but didn't really understand it until later. The keys are stuck, it skips and won't stop sometimes. This is with brand new batteries. It is also VERY hard to clean.."
1,not sturdy,"I got this for my 15 mt old daughter for Christmas. I am most disappointed with the lack of sturdiness of the plastic base pieces. Also, there are levers that you can flip down under the piano part that is supposed to keep the piano steady instead of letting it rock. My piano levers did not work and the piano always rocks. The long piece that runs from the piano base out to hold the seat part is very flimsy and bends quite easily. The seat itself does not fit properly onto the long plastic piece that is supposed to hold it. The screws to attach the long piece to the piano and the screws to attach the seat were very difficult to work with and they never did go in right. My daughter does love to play the keys on the piano and the music is quite nice but the design of the seating section needs some improvement."
3,"Great concept, but no interest","My 1 year old son loves music, so I got him this piano. He never played with it, so I gave it to his 1 and a half year old cousin, who at least likes to carry it from room to room."
5,Still loving this after a year!,"My Daugher got this as a gift for Christmas last year, now almost a year later at just age 2, she still loves it and it has grown with her. Be sure that you turn it off at night tho' because it will play automaticly if the floor is bumped or vibrated from walking!"
5,My son's favorite toy,"My son received this as a hand-me-down when he was 10 months and I wasn't sure if he'd play with it much. Let me tell you how wrong I was. He is constantly playing it, banging on it, flipping it over, dancing to the tunes, etc... He's a year old now and still loves it just as much.It has an on/off switch that also changes it from ""regular"" (where the child plays the keys) or ""auto"" (where it plays by itself). The child can also change the style of instrument sound that it makes. Also, another great feature is a tiny button underneath that changes the volume (thank goodness!) The keys light up when pressed and an attached plastic music book changes the tune when the pages are turned. This is a wonderful toy that has entertained my son daily. We all love it!"
5,My daughter LOVES this toy!!!,I bought this because my daughter loves to dance to music and of course likes to hit buttons. She loves this. She is 1 and I bought it for her for xmas and has had it for 2 months and plays with it everyday. I recommend this for any kit that likes music and likes to dance. She also surprisingly sat right on the seat. For a kid that does not walk yet she gets right up on it and starts rocking it back and forth.Oh and big plus is the volume switch! I have to say every toy should have this. The quiet volume is perfect for when you want to read and she is having fun but the noise is driving you crazy.
4,Great Fun,"I puchased this for my 10-month old daughter. She loves to play it in it's steady setting. She did not like the rocking as she would rock it all the way over. So far she likes it a lot and it keeps her interested for blocks of time which is very good. I work at home and need her distracted while I work on the computer. It works great to put it in a pack-n-play and she sits on the seat and just plays away. She likes that because it gives her sometime to put her back against. Without it, it tends to want to tip over. This is the only main complaint tha I have, but the music sounds good and is very entertaining."
3,Twice as long as Iczer-One and half as good,"Despite everything, Iczer-Three (aka Reborn) leads to a nice conclusion to the Iczer series. The everything of which I speak is that Reborn is twice as long and spends far too much time on the human characters. Yet, it is nice to see returning characters like Iczer-One and Iczer-Two near the beginning and end. Though, I really didn't think the voice for Iczer-Three fit her at all."
4,"Great ""Classic"" Anime!","This is the DVD release of Iczer 3, now renamed Iczer Reborn. A 6-part OVA from 1990 (give or take).It takes place after the battles in Iczer 1 with a battle for the Earth gain. Ste in the future it opens with Iczer 1 battling Neos Gold, Big Gold's off-spring. Some new characters are introduced, namely Iczer 3, plus the human crew of the Earth battleship - Queen Fuji. A surprise guest shows up from the original OVA towards the end which was nice.The action is fun, the characters cute and the story is fine. It is not as ""dark"" as the original, but it is well worth watching for fans of the ""classic"" era.All in all a good purchase and a decent price."
3,Anarchy? try Army Green,"The color of this bag was not well represented. It may be the computers I viewed it on, but I looked at it on a couple of different monitors. It appeared to be a lovely very light sagey green. It arrived a yucky Army green."
4,Fun for All,"My 1 year old son absolutely loves this. Mommy, daddy, and anyone else in the room have to join in. It's fun for him because he can see through it, and by adding blankets over the top adds extra fun"
5,Loved the product,"It is everything that it says it is. The quality is much higher than one I bought in some random store. Mesh (it really isn't mesh, more like fabric, but I don't know what to call it) has held up to all of my kids' antics. My 2 and 4 year olds really like it. The metal is hard on the knees for an adult, but the kids don't seem to mind it and, if that is the price of a toy that will last, I'll take it."
5,''Your soul is mine!'',"Three humen, Liu Kang, Johny Cage, and Sonya, are fighting in an ancient tournament called ''MORTAL KOMBAT''. But this ain't no ordinary tournament. This is a death-tournament, this means, that if one fighter kills the other fighter during the battle, it's tottaly legal.Now, those three fighters will have to survive through the tournament, so they can stop evil Shang Tsung's menace.This movie has great action scenes, and an amazing storyline. But what really shocked me about this movie were the special effects. I can hardly believe that this movie was made in 1995, when I see all those great effects, that even modern films don't have!The film is based on the video-game series ''MORTAL KOMBAT''."
5,action,this is a cool movie a must see the best scene is where jhonny cage fights scorpian.and the final battle is a must see.action action and more action.the best people are sonya lugang scopian sub zeroreptille .a must see and see the exelent unbad secul mortal kombat 2 annilation.
5,Probably best Fighter game to Movie!,"Great movie, i grew up watching this movie every other week. A must for the children of the 90s! a must for it in HiDef"
3,more of a guilty pleasure,"Its one of those movies you know is corny, but is very well done and enjoyable."
4,Mortal Kombat,"This movie is one of the few good Video Game based movies that are out there. It has all the characters from the game. The battles are very action packed with martial arts. The three ninja warriors Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile all work for Shang Tsung in this movie. They very much made the Reptile character horribly fake looking, a very tiny CG reptile creature, and having to end up in a statue to get a human form.The three Earth warriors Liu Kang, Johny Cage, and Sonya battle to win the tournament. Rayden plays the part of a guide mainly preparing Liu Kang for the challengs to come. Since so many video game movies usually make up original stories, or very inaccurate adaptions when they don't, I would say get this movie. Mortal Kombat is the closest you'll find right now."
4,less gore than i tought!,"i never really was a fan of the video game but i finally came across this movie remembering the trailer in the the mask:animated videos. i was basically blown away by the martial arts action in here i am a fan of karate and i am even an orange belt so i am always looking for a decent karate show to wacth and this was good,thoght the film lacks of charecter develoment and cheap spiecial effects, i reall enjoyed robin shou he is a great martial artist it's a shame he didn't star in other good films,the guy that played johhny cage did real good, the sonya charector was very cute!that christopher lambert guy looked and sounded just like my uncle,it's freaky."
2,Crap,"overall this movie is horrible. for someone who practices martical arts myself, some of these scenes are almost insulting. espescially the kano vs. sonya scence. she obviously has no knowledge of any form of martial arts and watching her fight almost made me feel embarassed for her. the only thing this movie is good for is entertaining you when your completely gone from too much alcohol consumption."
3,it's greeeatt,"fight after fight after fight is great except the fight with Guru which just plan sucked. Lindsey Ashbey is great as Cage, Shou as Lou Kang is kicking and Bridgette Wilson(now Wilson Sampras that she married Pete Sampras) is hot as Sonya Blade but the second movie had a even hotter Sonya. a good time. the end battle is the highlight. Christopher Lambert as Raiden is great."
2,Shallow and predictable,"When you take a video game where the whole game is simply one-on-one fighting, there is not much story to go with. Apparently the makers of this movie simply accepted that fact and said ""so what?""The action scenes are at times enjoyable, at times laughable, and at times boring. But more importantly, there are other ways they could have worked the use of fight scenes into this movie. That's one of the (few) things that they did better in the second film. Simply saying ""we're here for a Mortal Kombat tournament"" is easy but uninteresting.That said, it is interesting the ways they worked in some of the elements of the games. Those would only really matter to fans of the plotless video game series."
2,Ok but come on!,alright it had cool special effects but the video game is known for its violence - if you play the games right before you watch the movie you'd swear it was Barneys great adventure!
2,A popular video game is as real as it gets,"The film dose not have graphic violence in it like the video game does, because this is a kids movie."
3,Mortal Kombat is aight but game is better,This movie wuz okay for me but it needed to be longer plus Jax should have a longer part. Mortal Kombat fans would like this a lil'.
3,"Good Video-Movie Transformation, Nothing Else","This has to be the best based-on-video-game film out there. It's extremely dumb but extremely fun at the same time. Not everyone would enjoy it fully though, only fans of the video game and die-hard action fans would enjoy this. But for martial arts fans who haven't seen this film yet, beware the fight scenes and the fighters in this film are pure-Hollywoodised (on par with Van Damme/Seagal) and it ain't nothing compared to Jet Li/Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee/Gordon Liu 'fu-clasics of HK cinema. But although his fight scenes are crappy, Robin Shou (Liu Kang) has immense talent and should be casted as Forest Law in the Tekken movie."
3,Movie Good - DVD Bad,"The movie itself isn't too bad - basic martial arts video game cross over (don't expect Hemmingway).However the sound on the DVD is disgraceful. The spoken voices are all so low you have to turn the volume RIGHT UP....but wait, there is a hidden surprise - the special effects and music are so LOUD you will have your eardrums shattered and have to quickly fumble for that remote control again (all the while, ears bleeding) in order to turn it back down....only to discover that the loud SFX/Music have now stopped and you are once again confronted with the low volumed speach again!So, if you LOVE having the remote control at the ready - then this movie is for you!"
2,Why is this a DVD?,"Once again, the poor review does not reflect my feelings for the movie. ""Mortal Kombat"" is simply the best...scratch that...the ONLY good movie based on a video game. There's enough in it for fans and newcomers alike to enjoy. It's a big, silly ninja movie that doesn't take itself seriously, which is great.However, what's with the ... DVD? Trailors is what they offer us, nothing more? No commentaries, deleted scenes, or even ""making of""s?Well, forget it. Sod off, Mr. DVD Man. Buy the VHS copy, everyone, you'll get everything out of it you need. Refuse to support lazy DVDs!"
1,A horrible film by a horrible director (Paul W.S. Anderson),"What is there to say about this film you ask? Nothing much sadly because the storyline is too simplistic and offers too many cliches. The character development isn't that great, and most of the action sequences aren't very well choreographed. The only real great fight scenes were with Lou Kang vs. Reptile and the fight with Johnny Cage vs. Scorpion, so it's kind of a let down considering this film is based on a fighting game. The special effects in this movie aren't that impressive because you can tell it's not real. The only great acting performance in this film was by Christopher Lambert as Raiden, but everyone else wasn't really convincing in their roles. Overall, if you're a die hard fan of the video game series then you might enjoy this, but I think you want see a better sci-fi action film, then see the Terminator series or the original Star Wars trilogy."
4,Bloody hell!,"This is just so cool,this movie has the ecsact music and story as in the video game.I think that's preety cool!"
4,Superb special effects. Nuff said.,"Special effects of this movie is unparalleled. The fight scenes are not exactly realistic (especially the part where Reptile is flying out the wall after Liu Kang did that special kick move), but the fight scenes over all are very good, colorful characterization and a good sound track. I was dissapointed in how weak Kano's fighting skills were since he was one of the deadliest characters in the game, but aside from that the movie rocked, with the exception that the plot was extremely weak. Too bad the sequel gave Power Rangers a good name."
4,Good movie,This is a good movie. Tons of action. Classic in every way. Of course the story is cheese and this should only be picked up if you enjoy brain dead action flicks.
3,Bad audio,I am a fan of Mortal Kombat. But when I was watching the movie the audio just sucked!It was a bad audio transfer job.
3,"Campy, fun, overboard",I am a huge fan of B movies and flicks that look like they could have been played on Black Belt Theater. The campy special effects of MK reminded me of the many hours I spent watching BB theater and practicing moves even after I had been studying various martial arts. This movie reminds me of the old chestnut: do you train actors in the martial arts or do you train martial artists to act. I was impressed with Robin Shou and the actor that played Johnny cage (Linden Ashby). The blonde actress left me wishing the role would have gone to Cynthia Rothrock.
3,Truly impressive,"Come on, we all know the game. Shoa Kahn and Shang Tsung are trying to invade Earth but they can't do so without winning 10 straight victories in the tournament of Mortal Kombat and the lead characters Rayden, Liu Kang, Sonya, and Johnny Cage think they can do it. But they'll have to face the toughest opponents from the first two games: Goro, Sub-Zero, Kano, Scorpion, and Reptile. A little short on characterization but the special effects and action sequences make up for almost every individual short coming nicely. Only for fans of the original games. Tops the prior STREET FIGHTER movie like it doesn't exist."
2,What do you expect from something based on a video game?,"Paper-thin plot, laughable acting, and bad fight scenes in which one can easily guess the winner. The only saving grace is the special effects and art direction, but that can't keep Mortal Kombat from being a crashing bore. Designed for 11-to-12 year old boys."
3,Awesome Action & Special Effects,"If you've played the Game then you'd love this Big Screen Version also. Even if you haven't you'll still enjoy this. The movie has some really Great stuff of Action, Special Effects, Costumes and Set design. The plot is quite thin though, a bunch of Mortal men and women trying to save the world from the Aliens of the Outer World. The casting is also good. The movie features a lot of Martial Arts fights. If you're in for a fight after every 10 minutes then you got it. The fights are really well-choreographed. I would've loved to give this movie a 4 start rating had there been some plot also. To be honest, You won't ask for a thicker plot while watching this as the Kick-butt action sequences and Spectacular Special Effects would glue you to your seats. Buy it or rent it but Don't miss it..."
2,100% pizzazz made to cash in for a week and be forgotten,"Okay, first thing's first: I don't think there's anything wrong with attempting to make a movie based on a video game. It's just that this one is so weak and uninspired, It'll leave even Mortal Kombat fans disappointed (unless they're easily pleased and have short attention spans). The plot is very weak and contrived, the characters are 1-dimmensional and made of plastic, and the fight scenes are often ludicrous (escpecailly the ""double kicking"" move Lui Kang does to Reptile, which is quite laughable). The fight scenes had to be toned down for the movies rating (it still bothers me when they'll try and make a PG-13 movie from an R rated game).The visiual effects (particularly the netherworld) are interesting but only mediocre at best. In short, this movie is just a sell-out, and quite forgettable. Someone down below stated that this was ""The Best Movie of all Time."" I feel sorry for that person. I wonder if he has ever seen a good movie."
5,martial arts + supernatural,"if you like a varity of movies like i do, then this is the one for you. its very cool and intense!!"
1,I don't think so...,"This is, of course, based on the video game of the same name. It's about as much fun to watch as watching someone playing the game would be. You can regard yourself as having seen the whole movie once you're five minutes into it: appalling acting from all (although Lambert obviously has fun); dire lines; dreadful soundtrack; tediously fight scenes endlessly repeated substituting for a plot. There are some pretty cool special effects if you can stay awake long enough to notice them. No, if this puerile tosh ever gets mistaken for entertainment, you can take it as a sign than mankind has indeed been taken over by the demon dimension!"
1,nothing there,"this is something I pop in when I want to zone outthe only good thing about it is that it has christpoher lambert, and he is hot. that's it.no talent was required to make this movie. even christopher lambert could have been better."
3,Half of Roald Dahl's life in 200 pages,"SM SummaryGoing Solo is an auto-biography of Roald Dahl. In this book Roald Dahl joins the army to fight in WW II while he is in Africa in the 1930's and 40's, Dahl comes face to face with many dangers, including lions, poisonous snakes, war waging people, and many other things while he is fighting for England. He has many adventures while he is in the war. This book is a good read and is hard to put down. if you like Roald Dahl than read this book."
5,This may be even better than Harry Potter!,"Going Solo talkings about Roald Dahl being from an tennager to an adult. In the book, Roald Dahl talks about his experience in Africa working for the Shell companyHe also talks about WWII as a raf fighter pilotHis biograph isn't boring like most but very exciting!I would reccommend this book to most readers who have finished reading the first part of Roald Dahl's biograph, which is called Boy Tales of ChildhoodIf you haven't read that yet, I suggest that you don't read Going Solo."
5,This book shows how Roald Dahl can write books like he dose,"This book shows the key points of the formation of the vivid imagination Rald Dahl has. It gives an indepth look into the wonderful and not so wonderful experience's he has in Africa, and being a airoplane pilot in world war II."
5,gOING sOLO IS GREAT!!!!,"tHIS BOOK IS GREAT!!!Roald dahls bio is actually like a story!Instead of writing boring stuff about life, Roald Dahl will make u very intrest and will make want to read moreYou would n't put the book down until you finish itAnd even after finishing, you would dream of it and want to read it againAnother book reccomende is Boy, tales of childhood"
1,Dead or didn't work,"I spent time installing this - had to remove the CPU cooler and reinstall it... and it completely failed to work! I called Antec and they mentioned a compatibility problem with 965 boards (which I was using) and this PS. Supposedly I had a ""fixed"" unit though, but it failed to work. Going back to the old PS (an Antec SmartPower) worked without a problem."
1,Bad Psu cant run in asus and intel 965wh boards!!!,"This Power Supply cant run in a asus boards, and many intel 965 boards ...and in other because the anemic +5v and +3.3v 17A and 23A, and today the power needed is minimun 25A and 35 A in this rails.

2,Not a good fit,The tent seems to be good. But the tunnel does not fit well into the tent. Just comes off too easily when the kids try to crawl through it. Would find a better tent tunnel combination that holds up strong.
5,Great Tent,"We bought this tent for my 6 year old's birthday. Our daughters are 6 and 3. We've only used this tent indoors. Very nice. Very cute. The girls love playing in it... pretend house, pretend camp, pretend slumber party. After 6 months the tent is still in perfect condition. Honestly, I would have to imagine if anyone's tent is tearing or the rods are breaking, then maybe their children are too rough with it. I teach my girls to take care of their toys.The tent is very, very easy to put up, take down and store. I have no complaints. I would definitely buy this product again or buy it for a gift."
2,I returned these shoes.,I did not like the look of the leather. It looked like cheap brown vinyl. They weren't very comfortable either. This was a disappointment since I've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past.
5,Great,I brought this for my Mother. She loves the shoes. This is the only place I could get them. Her Christmas was made by receiving this product.
3,Wasn't a good fit for me.,"I usually wear a 10AAA, but this shoe was too narrow for me. Maybe it would have stretched out, but I don't have the patience for that. So I had to return it."
1,too narrow,I have worn many Easy Spirit shoes over the years and owned this particular style at least 4 times. Unfortunately this pair was way too narrow! What happened?
3,Too narrow,"I ordered this shoe directly from the Easy Spirit site. I ordered a medium width, and that is the marking the shoe is showing, but it is much too narrow for my foot, making it very uncomfortable. I made the mistake of not returning them, thinking that I could wear them and stretch them out: That didn't work. Guess I'll spend the money to take them to a shoe-shop to have them professionally stretched."
2,Dissapointment,"I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit. This time, the same size, 6M did not fit, they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes, I looked inside my old shoes to find the size, I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful, just what I was looking for, but not a good fit."
3,Too Close For Comfort,I increased my width to 2E to accommodate a comfortable fit but it was still too close for a comfortable fit. You may need to go one size up to get a comfortable fit. It looks quite attractive on the foot however.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe. The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes. The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway.
1,worst shoe i have EVER bought not comfortable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought!!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
2,motion sport lace up by easy spirit,Runs short and narrow for me. I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,A Good Shoe That I Had to Return,"Like all Easy Spirit shoes, this pair was well-made. I had to return the pair because the shoe was too small. Although I wear a 6.5 in other Easy Spirit styles, this shoe was too short. You may want to order a half-size larger if you order this style."
2,"""Dressy Lace-up""","Be aware that this shoe--in a WIDE- is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide. The shoe runs narrow. However,it does come in an Extra Wide. Although the shoe has little to no arch support,it is, nevertheless a ""dressy"" alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet."
3,Size runs very small,Couldn't get my foot more than half way in. Liked the style very much but was not confident I would get the right size by reordering. Cost me ove 8 dollars to return the shoes.Easy Spirit Women's Motion Sport Lace Up/ camel
3,This pair is much tighter than others in the same size,"I have other pairs of this same style by Easy Spirit in the same size and this pair is really tight on my feet. I am trying to stretch these out with stretchers to make them fit better. Might want to consider ordering a half size up. Other than poor fit, they look nice. Color is not as pictured at all, it is more of a hot chocolate color."
1,Shoe Disappointment,"I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them. Now the D width is too tight, especially on my left foot. The shoes will be returned."
4,Easy spirit Shoes,"Love these shoes - could not find them in ther stores in my area. They hae every color but white. Have a pair but they are really old and wanted a pair that looked nicer. The shoes are comfortable and they look a little more dressy than the normal tennis shoe. Paid a little more than the price at our stores but, they are worth the extra cost."
5,Motion,I love these shoes. Have been wearing them for years and hope Easy Spirit does not EVER stop making them! Great support for tired feet!
5,Easy Spirit Motion Walking Shoes,"These are the most comfortable shoes ever made and they look very conservative. I have them in several colors because they look good with slacks or skirts. They hold up well with everyday use and are lightweight so they pack well. If you try one pair, you keep coming back to them for your basic wardrobe."
4,"Cute, comfortable, smart and stylish","I purchased these shoes to wear for casual wear with my jeans when I did not want to wear my regular walking shoes. They are cute, stylish and comfortable for everyday wear, not recommended for heavy walking."
3,Easy Spirit review,"The shoes run large so order a half-size lower than normal. They just didn't fit right on my Mom, she was really disappointed. Usually Easy Spirit is more true to size."
5,Great Documentary About Japanese Counter Culture,"I found this fascinating. It's a lifestyle I didn't even know existed. There's an ethereal quality to the main characters and I found the overall ambiance of this film to be wistful and poignant. It's about male escorts and their interplay with their ""clients"". It's worth noting that men don't appear to be able to emotionally handle this trade any better than women do. I may go back and watch it again now that it's been a few years."
5,Amazing film,You have to see this stuff to believe it - amazing! Very strange and quite funny too. Definately worthwhile.
3,its ok,This book is good if you already have finance background. Solved examples are fewer than needed and all unsolved problems don't have answers. This book is not perfect i am facing hard time to get through.
5,The text and the style of writing is somehow difficult.,"What I want to mention hear is not aboat the contents of the book. I found the text and the style of writing somehow difficult for someone who knows English as a second language. Although my English is good, I still had some problems. My friends who are not so strong in English had lots of problems and many of them failed to finish the book. All in all, compared to other books from the publisher, the text is difficult and has to be simplified. I hope for the next edition of the book, the publisher and writers would take it into acount."
2,Defective copy....,The seller was great and I had no issues with them. The book itself is apparently a defective edition. I checked with others and all the images are missing starting after page 202. Not good.
1,Boo Hoo,I bought this cd because I Am fan of fifteen even though some of the lyrics are kind of whinny hippy crap.However this one just goes to far the song white pride almost made me puke.I threw my copy in the garbage so no one would have to here it.
4,C-Dog35,I Received one of these razors from my Fiancee for Christmas been using since and works great.I have been using the same cartridge all week and received a very close and comfortable shave each morning.I really like it the trimmer works well for trimming side burns not sue what else.Really helped clear up my razor burn and prevent future bumps.
2,"Okay, but troublesome 5-blades","This razor, in my opinion, is okay. Not great but not horrible. When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it's hard to continue shaving when there's hair worsening the blades' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades."
3,Caveat emptor,"The lengthy product literature above (apparently from Gilette) is misleading for this model. It touts the advantages of the Fusion Proglide razor, and the vibrating Fusion. Both of those razors cost more. I'm not sure why anyone would want to talk a customer out of the exact product at hand (Fusion Manual); surely they didn't intend any ""bait and switch"" but it sure was careless -- and relatively uninformative.BTW I do indeed own a Gilette (Manual) Fusion razor and have used it. I wasn't all that impressed, and I don't find it significantly better than the old Mach 3. For the money (and cheaper blades in the long run) I prefer the Schick Quattro Titanium."
1,bigguy,Love the razor but the price of the blades is hard to believe. Four blaeds for $17.00 they don't last any longer than any other blade. I had a $2.00 coupon & still couldn't get myself to buy them.
2,more blades more money,"Based on all the hype I decided to give this a try. I have very sensitive skin with a tough beard that sems not to grow in any particular grain. OK, so it has 5 blades; truth is it doesn't shave any better than the model with 3 but the blades are hideously expensive. I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself. I still have to go over and over the same area, shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave. True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I'm not sure that justifies the cost either. I will probably use the 2 blades that came with it and then put it in the goodwill bag. Oh yes, by the way, it is very pretty, if that makes a difference when you are shaving."
1,all is not well in Fusion land,"Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades. This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors. The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face. The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face."
4,Works smooth with out nicks,This is the second razor that I have. The first one I lost on vacation and when I was looking for a replacement this one works so well I just bought it again
3,I had to edit this review... DOH!,"I still believe this razor for the most part is a gimick. Tonight when shaving I changed the cartridge that came on the handle to the spare on the back of the case and I got much better results. I took a closer look at the original cartridge and it didn't look right. Looks dull to me, no wonder I was getting cut up bad. I have contacted Gillette and I'm waiting for a response. I hope this isn't some kind of manufacturing flaw, but if it is this razor should be recalled or we should be compensated.Anybody else have this problem?"
1,Stick with the Mach III,Do not buy this product. I found that I got more nicks and cuts from using it. My skin would hurt from the extra friction. Stick with the MACH III. The MACH III does a great job. The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price. I used it for about a month - Now I'm back to the MACH III.
2,Like the rest,"I found this razor as the same as the other ones. Don't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one. The only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose, etc"
5,I thought it was a joke ... it's anything but!,"The first thing that came to mind, and many have already said it, was the Saturday Night Live skit with a 15-bladed razor. I thought, ""Come on, FIVE blades?""Then I tried it.Holy smokes, I think there is actually a product that lives up to its claims. I'm 45 with pretty sensitive skin - nick and burn easily. This razor does it and good. No nicks at all, and a smooth, comfortable shave. I use it with Neutrogena's Razor Defense gel, and think there isn't going to be any better combination.(This is for the manual razor. The notion of sticking a battery/vibrator in a bladed razor just gives me the willies.)"
1,Dull blades --- It sucks!,"I'm a girl but got a free one of these in the mail. Omg it sucks so bad, which is weird because usually mens razors are superior to womens. The blades are extremely dull and I couldn't shave anything with it, the head is also small and cheap and doesn't contour to curves. I had to grab my months old Venus razor to finish the job because this razor just didn't shave well at all."
4,Gillette is a great product,My boyfriend and I only use gillette razors. they are the most effective for us. I really like the flexibility in the razors so we can get a close shave without cutting ourselves.
1,Much Ado About Not Much,"Not a significant improvement over the Mach 3 in terms of closeness of shave or less nicks/irritation. Underneath my unfortunately tough & wiry facial hair is very soft & sensitive skin prone to redness, nicks and the whole gamut of after-shave horrors. For my money (excuse me if I choke up here) the Mach 3 gives the best results all around of an unavoidable daily experience."
3,"Good, but not the ""closest ever""","Gillette sent me one as a promo. I tried it. Pros first. It does provide a close shave, with little irritation, even going against the grain. Cons: It is no better than a Sensor Excel, Mach 3, etc. Blades cost a FORTUNE (won't be buying any) and, regarding their claim that it will provide the closest shave ever- after shaving with it I stropped up (that is, sharpened) my straight razor, something I use perhaps once a year for kicks, and shaved with that. AFTER shaving with the fusion. Rather than rinse the lather off the razor, I wiped it on a white cloth. Results? LOTS of little bits of stubble the so called ""advanced"" Fusion left.Is it a good razor? Yes. Is it better than competitors? Not really. Is it worth the astronomical cost for replacement blades? No way!"
1,Simply terrible,"I gave it a try for pretty much the last year until I ran out of blades that I had pre-purchased. I'm done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave. Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other ""detail"" parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front. It just doesn't work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use."
1,The worst I have ever used,"This is an upgrade? This razor is terrible. I usually let my facial hair go for a few days and then shave. The system worked great with the Mach 3 but I decided to ...upgrade. Big mistake, this thing is like shaving with a dull saw. Back to the Mach 3 for me."
3,Good news / Bad news,"I got one in the mail and being resourceful, I gave it a try even though it appeared as though this might feel like shaving with a 2x4 the head is so big. Well it does take a little getting used to coming from a cheap Bic but the shave is amazing and that single blade works wonders under your nose. I absolutely love the thing....TILL!!!.....I went to buy replacement blades. Yeeeeoooooowwwwwwweeeeeeee $13.00 for 4 stinkin blades!!!!! Yikes!!!!!!! Sadly I forgot my glasses and clearly couldn't read the price on the shelf at the grocery store; I thought they were an excellent deal at $2.99. Well I couldn't see the 1 in front of the 2. Is it worth it??? Debatable; I'm not sure I'll spring for blades again. That was a painful eye opener."
3,Doesn't work well if you shave infrequently,"I found that this razor doesn't work as well as my Mach 3 for infrequent shaves. The blade spacing is much closer than the Mach 3 so it requires many more passes to take off the long hairs. I find the single blade on the back side handy to trim unruly nose hairs and around the lips.I received this as a free sample from Sam's and I won't buy more, but if a person shaved more than once or twice a week it might be a good investment, as it does get a close smooth shave. I used this razor with Gillette's razor gel."
1,One word.....Garbage,"It's a shame how Gillette keeps trying to grab more money from its loyal clientele especially with this piece of garbage. I got a free Fusion razor in the mail and hated it from the first day. The blade and the so called ""lubricating strip"" were literally worn out by day 3. With the cost of replacement blades, even purchased in bulk, what it costs to use this thing would require most people to get a second job! Stick to Sensor or Sensor Excel, does a better job and is MUCH cheaper."
1,Don't Buy It,"I have to shave every day. This is not a good shave. It is very uncomfortable on the skin. The Mach 3 is a much better shave. I tested both for several months, each one for a week or so. Each one is the power handle which definitely helps. The fusion is rough on the skin, I even received nicks on my skin. I don't know why this is. Don't waist your money and time. I tested them for several months because I thought more blades would be better but are not in this case."
2,Not that impressed,"I bought this razor because I had run out of Mach3 blades and remember this being advertised on television. I know that Gillette has made great razors in the past so I bought it. The design, I would give it 5 stars however, the single blade trimmer is not all that effective and like many of the reviews above it is very difficult to clean. The five blades however did not run as smoothly across my face. Yes it gave me an incredibly close shave the first couple of tries but on the third day i felt that I was sawing at my face and having to do multiple strokes in areas just to cut the whiskers."
2,not nearly worth the money,"It gives more irritation than the Mach 3 Turbo, and doesn't shave as close."
1,This razor is terrible,"I just bought and used the gillette Fusion razor. Halfway through I said the heck with this, and got my trusty mach 3 turbo out.The razor is just too big. It feels like your shaving with a butcher knife or something. I'm returning it to Target today after work. Seriously, don't waste your time or money. It's not worth it."
5,A Must HAVE book!,"The moment I sat down with ""Forgotten Star"", I couldn't put it down! Within these pages unfolds the story of Hollywood star Margot Durning, her life, her love, her legacy!! I really couldn't stop reading this wonderful book! The skill with which Mr. Leonard has developed the story line will make you wonder if Margot Durning really didn't exsist! The heyday of Hollywood, with its glitz and shine is a sharp contrast to the stark beauty the reader finds about the panhandle of Northwest Oklahoma. This book would make an INCREDIBLE movie!! You won't be disappointed!"
1,Forgotten Star Best Forgotten,"I was quite excited to discover a book set in the area of the country where I grew up. When I saw the 5 star rating - I couldn't wait for the book to arrive. No words can truly express my disappointment with this book. Mr. Leonard's story has potential, but I had trouble following it due to all of the grammatical errors and typos. The storyline was a good one, but it was impossible to comprehend fully due to the poor editing job. Mr. Leonard might have writing skills, but his decision making skills when it comes to editing leads to the demise of this book. Margot Durning deserves better."
5,Very good,Very good would highly recommend.Have used this for a year now and love the way the product really helps coat your dog or animals fur. My dog had dry skin before using this product. Now it is gone after the first few times using it.
5,cleaner,This cleaner material works great in the new Jewelry ultrasonic cleaner I also purchased. It allows me to continously keep all my jewelry sparkling.
5,good product,Easy to use...Amazon is my go to place! I don't have to fight the crowds and I just let my fingers do the walking. The return policy is wonderful too! Easy sneezy!
3,does decent job,"it is high price for a very small amount, probably would save by purchasingcleaner in local discount store. does adequate job, but nothing outstanding."
4,Jewelry Cleaner,This product was just what I was looking for and at a great price. Great people/ company to deal with.
5,Works well,"I cleaned my rings and watch with this cleaner and it removed the grime well. I tried it in my ultrasonic cleaner, and I have to say it works much better if you don't use it in an ultrasonic cleaner."
1,too expensive,"Wow, just put the gun away…this product is way too expensive for the quantity. One can find quality cleaners for half the price."
3,effective,I didn't notice an exceptional difference between this cleaner and others I have tried. I wouldn't pay more for this. I use it with my ultrasonic cleaner machine and it is effective.
4,Great read,"Overall, easy transaction. The book is very touchy on provoking emotions from the reader. The published stories in the book are very eyeopening and realistic. Sender made the transaction easy to work with."
1,Slow read,"There wasn't much of a plot. The author, used commas, just about, everywhere. Made it very difficult to read. It might have been avant-garde when it was introduced in the early 19th century but now, it's just a slow read where nothing happens."
1,What I Know: This Book is Literary Torture,"I read about halfway through this book, and then I gave up. I read James' ""Turn of the Screw,"" and ""Daisy Miller"" in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.) One of my all time favorite books was James' ""Washington Square."" It's hard for me to believe that the same man wrote ""Square"" and ""Maisie."" This book is only for MAJOR Henry James enthusiasts."
2,Usual Glacial Paced Novel from James,"This is so typical of H. James writing...very, make that incredibly, dense. Wordy beyond belief. At a pace that surely puts me fast asleep after a mere 2 pages. A ridiculous pair of uncaring parents essentially abandon their daughter to whomever comes along. As an amazing coincidence, the divorced parents each take a new spouse only to watch the wife of one have an affair with the husband of the other. If you are really into dialogue that no one has ever spoken in the history of English and willing to devote hours to really obscure language construction, this is the very winner for you."
2,I love classics. I'll never read Henry James again.,"It's his style I can't get my arms around...conceptually interesting, but his writing here flows like a gutter clogged with leaves, only occasionally achieving the fluidity I look for in fine writing. I chose it because it was shorter than some of the more famous ones. Life is too short. I'll sell it back."
5,"Nasty, funny, and searing","I have not read any other James, except for Daisy Miller over 20 years ago, but picked this up on a friend's recommendation.Yes, you do have to read this book slower than most novels, but it is well worth it. It is a sharp, dark, and devastating satire on how adult use children. Each character that Maisie encounters uses her as a prop to meet their own emotional needs--any affection they give her is purely secondary.Perhaps many people do not like this book because it is so relentlessly dark. As the book goes on and Maisie is more and more aware of by the coldness around her the same behavior that makes the reader snicker in the first chapters becomes painful.If you are looking for a escapist period novel--skip this one. If you want something more probing--this is well worth picking up."
5,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!,"This is an amazing CD form an amazing band but you can find this from a distro for $5 still. If you still go to shows, you will most likely find this or know someone who can hook you up. The guy selling the CD for over $100 should be ashamed of himself. I just have to laugh at this...because If I don't laugh I will scream!!!"
2,not durable,"Several of these came with my crossbow so I used them to sight in and bought Gold Tip brand bolts for hunting. They're a bit brittle/ fragile as compared to the Gold Tip bolts. They were destroyed by target shooting, some had the inserts pull out and left the insert and broadhead inside my target and others snapped off when I pulled them out. It seemed to me like just the force of hitting the layered target was enough to crack the arrow or break the glue loose and they finished breaking when I tried to pull them out."
1,Broke within a day or two.,Got these for my son for Christmas to protect his eyes while target shooting with his airsoft gun. They broke within a couple of days.I would not recommend.
2,Rules light,"This book contains dated material. As of january 1, 2008 the Rules and the decisions of golf have been substantial changes. All of then good and many of them will come into play every day. Also, the author references 5 dumest interpretations and goes on to state that Rules officials should not be so strict in interpreting the Rules. While that may be a nice thought, the realities are that the writers of the Rules (The USGA and The R&A) put enormous thought into the way the rules are written so that Officials in the field can uniformly interpret the rules. The Officials have no room for error in ensuring that all players are playing by the same rules and playing on a level playing field. It is an interesting book, just don't make any wagers based on what you read inside. If you really want to understand the rules purchase the publication: Decisions on the Rules of Golf from the USGA."
2,"bad item, it crapped out","Xantrex Technologies XPower Pocket Mobile Power Source 175-Watt Inverter #813-0291I used this product for about 10 days and then it stopped working, it would overheat and making a high pitched beeping noise with no power output. I would invest in a higher quality inverter, I wish I never wasted my money."
4,Xantrex Mobile Power Inverter,This product works good. I have used it only once so far. The price is acceptable too.
3,Long distance driver with kids,Unit has the juice to power the wife's laptop and the kids' DVD player though I got nothing out of the USB plug even when everything else was unplugged.
4,"Very useful, works well",I've found this to be very easy to use and quite useful. The only drawback so far is that the power switch indicator (blue LED with a translucent cover) can be tough to see in daylight making it difficult to tell if the device is operating or not.
1,Different Product -- NO Airplane Adapter,"The delivered product was different from the product listed on this page: The delivered product had NO airplane adapter, despite the product description and the linked manual stating otherwise. Since I bought it specifically for use on an upcoming plane trip, this product is completely useless to me. Instead, the product contains an extra cable to connect it directly to a car battery; it also includes a connector for the standard cigarette lighter.If you are only planning to use this product in a car or from a car battery, it may work fine. However, if you are planning to use it on an airplane, you are out of luck."
3,Disappointed by product.,"I too bought the unit based on the vendors reputation. It is small and powered my Dell D600 laptop without a problem using the battery adapter, but it got pleasantly warm. But there were some issues.1. You must press a button to power it on and the small blue LED is very hard to see. If the power is interrupted, you've got to press the button to turn it on again. I'd prefer a slide or rocker switch for always on if powered.2. The cigarette adapter didn't stay securely plugged into either receptacle on my Dodge 2500 truck. The slightest touch interrupted power and the unit shut off. Other adapters, (which have a shorter nose) worked fine. Attempted to contact the vendor using their contact WWW page to see if there was an alternate adapter.No response. I've since returned the product."
2,It failed and I goofed,"Xantrex Technologies XPower Pocket Mobile Power Source 175-Watt Inverter #813-0291It totally pooped out and failed after only a few months occasional use. It worked fairly well on some things like 85 watt curling iron and cellphone charger. It would recharge the laptop but struggled to power the laptop if the laptop battery was low. This despite the very low power demand rating on the laptop.Recently on a long trip it just wouldn't work any more. We looked it over, tried a different cord on it, and it wouldn't respond. Forgetting it had a one year warranty and having no room for dysfunctional stuff, we tossed it in the trash. Rats!We are shopping for a 400 or 500 watt inverter now. This one was marginal for our laptop and we need to be able to count on the inverter for the things we need it for. I wouldn't recommend this tiny device."
3,Works as expected,"Got this for a road trip from San Diego to LA to charge up my cellphone. It worked great at the beginning.After one hour into driving, my cellphone started making noise indicating the power was connected/disconnected. Unplugging and replugging the charger made the symptom went away for just a brief moment. It seems like the power went on and off repeatedly. I am not sure if this was caused by the inverter or the cellphone charger, but I've never had any problem when the charger was connected to the wall directly.As noted in other reviews, the power indicator is not bright enough to tell if the unit is on. This is especially true when driving under the hot sun. And it gets really hot when operating."
1,Almost DOA... broke right away,"I was excited to be able to plug everything in without a car adapter... but this stopped working within a month of buying it. I had a close look at it and some of the wires weren't connected all the way, as if they'd been yanked out or (as I'm sure is the case) never assembled correctly to begin with. At the same time as I say don't buy it, I'm not sure which one *is* good because I never tried a different one."
3,Light but not a relaible product,Pro -- light and works in carCon -- Works only on American Airlines outlets; but not on any other airline. I was also disappointed that this Inverter failed after one month. I e-mailed Xantrex and their customer service rep ran me in circles for over a month until he agreed to replace my product.
1,No plug for airplane,"Please be ware, that this inverter does not have the airplane plug. No bag either. The inverter's size is small. This product does not match the user manual. The user manual might be an old version. I gave it one star since I need it with a airplane plug."
1,irritating to deal with,i didn't get to use this product because i never recieved it in time for the deadline needed. the return policy is horrible and they charge a restocking fee (even though my item was unopened) so don't buy anything unless you are absolutely sure you need the exact item.
3,No Airplane Adapter,"Be aware that Xantrex has changed the design of the product and is a lot smaller and is not as picture. It also DOES NOT have the airline adapter as stated in the description. It now only includes a cigarette plug and a car battery clamp. So if you need this product for in airplane use, the redsigned product will not meet your needs. I was able to scavenge an airline adapter from a Xantrex inverter I had."
5,a groundbreaker - portent of the future,"Live concert recordings were almost unknown in 1944. Norman Granz took a bunch of musicians working around Hollywood and let them play as they pleased. Recording quality is excellent for the day. This disc made stars of Nat Cole, Les Paul and Illinois Jaquet. The feeling of audience involvment is almost tangible - it has not dated in over 50 years."
5,Better than Zagat's,"good fun and useful. i really agree with what they say about places. they tell me about the restaurants, good and bad, not themselves. covers lots of places out in the neighborhoods. maps are useful for finding places. it's nice looking, too."
5,EXCELLENT BUY!,"We bought this toy for my son when he was 9 months old. He loved pushing it around as a walker and absolutely loved playing with the balls and music. He is now 18 months old and still loves to ride his bike. It goes all over the house with him. I have found this toy to be very stable and unlike the other reviews have never had a problem with my child hurting himself on it. He even stands up on it now,even though we discourage him of this, and it has never caused an accident."
3,Not so great,"I think this toy should be recalled. It is front heavy and while my toddler was pushing it, it flipped forward and took her with it. It was frightening to watch. You have to be right there walking behind your child when using this."
3,"The toy is great, BUT CAREFUL OF THE BALLS BEHIND IT!","I have recieved this toy as a gift for our son Giovanni! But was disappointed by how the balls fell out while he walked behind it.He loves the walking part, but kept tripping when the balls fell out causing him to fall.I called Fisher-Price and had them try it out there, they knew what I was talking about and are sending me a pre-paid label to send back. They were helpful in that. I just feel bad, because he does love the toy.Also have problems with the screen table with the screen not stopping. I will call them on it and hope they wii refund me and will get the leapfrog table.Hope you don't have the same problem!"
4,"Love it so much, had to get another one!","I first got this toy 4 years ago at a yard sale for my oldest boy. Well, it's been through 2 kids, really rough boys, and we just had to get another one. They play with it every day, and it's still going strong. The handle did come off, that's why we got another one for my third boy to enjoy when he's old enough. I love this toy, and I'm so glad that I ran across it 4 years ago."
1,Dangerous - flips easily!,"I had this for my daughter and it was cute and all. However, when the V was opened and she would walk, if she would lean to right or left the thing would flip right or left. Get ready for a crying toddler. The front wheels are closer together than the back wheels, same idea as a 3 wheeler was when they were legal...this thing had the tendency to fall over each side of the V. I would not recommend this. I sold it at my yard sale. I just got another one as a gift from family and I will be returning it."
2,This toy should be recalled!,"My son likes this toy, but the back wheels keep falling off! Every time he runs into an object with it, one of the back wheels falls off, and the thing falls over on him, and he ends up under it. No matter what we do, we can't push them in so that they stay on, even when we hear them ""click"" into place. Also, when we try to put the sides together to let him ride on it, the latch that keeps it open is so tight that it takes two of us to switch it. It was a gift, so we can't take it back to the store, but I am going to contact Fisher Price about the wheel problem."
3,Not sure to date,"My son is just 8 months so though he is not walking with this on his own, he does hold onto it and walks a few steps with me holding onto him. He loves the sounds it makes and getting the balls out of the chutes to knock together. He has fallen off once but can sit on it comfortably. Not sure yet if it will get any use with it as a walker though, it does seem very low to the ground and he is already 29"", so he may outgrow it before he can use it for its main purpose."
3,WAY TOO FAST,"This is a good toy, however, it goes entirely too fast. My son slumped over it while tryn to learn to walk with it. He continuously banged his legs on the seat part while walking with it. other than that, durable of course, anything by fisher-price is durable. Its a bit pricy and I ended up taking the toy back and got another OLDER model of fisher price walking toy, he loves that better and he walks upright."
4,Great walker!,"My son, now almost 11 months loves this walker over all of the ones he has tried at neighbors' houses. This one has more side to side stability, which makes it safe, and the wheels move more easily over the carpet than some others. The music is motivating, and the balls are an added plus (if you can find them). He still isn't able to turn it, but he learned at about 9 1/2 months to maneuver himself around to the front and push it backwards to get out of a corner. The locking mechanism to move it from a walker to a ride on (and especially to move it back) is difficult, but it's still worth it. His 19 month and 3 year old cousins renewed their love for this toy when we were visiting--they all fought over it."
3,In agreement,"My son also had a hard time using this as a walker. It did go too fast for him to keep up (hardwood and tile floors). Now that he can walk well on his own he likes it much more. He especially likes crashing it into the wall. No damage to either the wall or the toy (yet). He loves to push the nose (repeatedly) and he was so pleased with himself when he figured out where those darn balls kept going. He also loves to fill the basket with other toys and give them rides. Overall, one of his top picks."
4,Khristian's Review,"My son loves to push this around, he enjoys the music and has learned how to push the nose on the front to make it play music."
2,Too Fast,My daughter whom is 10 months old and is on the verge of walking received this as a gift. Its cute and she loves putting the balls in the hoop and getting them out again. The problem is when she gets up and pushes it she has to nearly run behind it where as she falls to her knees. It would be alot better if she could push it instead of it dragging her.
3,Moves too fast,"I bought this for my 9 mnth old, but it's not his favorite. It rolls away whenever he tries to play with it either crawling or trying to pull up. We've had it a month now and he enjoys playing with the balls, but will not put them in the basket. Maybe he'll like it more once he can walk on his own, but it moves too fast and easily to be a walker."
1,HORRIBLE & DANGEROUS!,"I purchased this for my 1 year old daughter. I just want to say that this toy is dangerous and I hope they take it off the market. It is too heavy in the front and not enough weight in the back so when your ""not yet walker"" tries to push it, it topples over and my daughter did a summer sault over the toy and nearly hurt herself!!! I am calling Fisher Price. DON""T BUY THIS!"
1,AWFUL,"We bought this toy for our son, and with in 10 minutes realized it needed to return to the store. He is just learning how to walk, and this is not the toy to help a child learn stability. Not only did he have a difficult time pulling himself up due to it moving, when he did it rolled away leaving him face down. For me, this falls under the don't waste your money."
1,UNSAFE,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas. She ejoyed it at first, but we soon discovered it is very front heavy. She kept tipping FOrward and hurting herself. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!"
1,What a disappointment!,My son is just turning 10 mos & I thought this would be a good toy to help him explore walking. Well he wanted nothing to do with it. He fell off several times trying ride it. I can't imagine a much older child trying to ride it. It is very low to the ground. He did enjoy throwing the balls down the hallway & under the furniture. For the price I will just go buy him some balls to play with. Also it is extremely hard to take apart to return. Whew what a work out.
2,It sucks!,"My daughter is a year old. We got the walker a few months ago. My husband put it together, we helped our daughter hold on to the handle and it flew out from under her like a bullet!She would sometimes crawl behind it and push it. But, she got bored with that. Now that she has started walking she doesn't pay any attention to it. We fixed it where she can sit on it and push herself along, but her legs are too short. She threw balls into the basket a couple of times, but she has another toy that she can throw balls in that she likes a lot better.Also, the annoying music comes on so easily. All you have to do is walk near it and it goes off.We're getting her something different soon."
1,Poor Walker,"My son was never able to use this toy for a walker. The speed of the toy never allowed him to push it as he learned to walk. I would much prefer a walker with a speed control. The height of the toy was also a challenge for my son. As a walker, he had to bend over to far, and as a ride on he sits to low to the ground. My son is tall for his age, but he has not been able to use the toy for a walker or ride on from age 8 months to 16 months. He is now to tall to use it at all."
3,He likes it okay,"My 1 year old son does enjoy walking with it, and he is just getting to ride on it, however it doesn't turn. When he can't turn around, he just stops playing with it. But he does like the music and I think he will like it more when he's a bit older to ride on. Of course that defeats the purpose of the ""walker"" part."
3,Just okay not the best,"I brought this item and found it was great for interaction, encouraged walking and great to ride on, but the problem with it was I found the wheels don't turn, this is why I returned the item (you can only go back and forth). It would only be good when the child gets older and has the strength to lift it, definately not recomended on wooden floors.It does say swival wheels but this does not occur I've tried two of them."
1,Not stable... not safe!,"We bought this walker for our son when he was 10 months old. It's terrible and I am surprised that Fisher-Price would market such a dangerous toy! It's too heavy in the front and tips easily. If you use it on a hard floor, it moves way too fast for a beginner walker. My son tried to walk with it and fell flat on his face! The wheel popped off a couple of times. And the space between the two legs is too narrow and my son kept getting his feet caught in the legs!The only saving grace to this terrible toy is the fact that my son likes to press the nose to hear the music!VERY DISAPPOINTING!Kathy - mom to 2 yr old"
2,"Durable, but not too safe","We gave this to my 8 mth. old and I have to agree that it does go too fast and he had a hard time keeping up, thus he ended up falling. He also can't change directions, so basically he goes until he runs into something. Also, it does flip forward from time to time when he leans on it as well. When he falls or it flips, he sometimes bumps his chin on the handle which is too rough for that reason--probably needs to be made of rubber. Sometimes his feet bang against the legs of the walker as he's moving and causes him to fall. He does enjoy the balls and putting them in the basket. The music is quite entertaining. It is a durable product, but not as safe as I would have liked. He hasn't used it yet to ride on, so I can't speak for that aspect."
4,Great for Twins,"I bought this walker when my twins were 10 months old. I was hoping it would encourage them to walk more. At first they weren't too interested in using it as a walker, but once I put the legs together and sat them on it, that was it! It only took a couple of days for them to figure out how to climb on the seat and start pushing themselves, or whinning until someone did it for them. They both LOVE to ride around on it. And 10 year old big brother loves pushing them around the house. My boy twin will even push my girl twin on his knees. The balls and basket didn't do much for them, I think we lost the balls within a week. And the song is sort of annoying. If you walk too hard anywhere near it, it starts playing. But the kids really seem to enjoy the music, as they're flying all over the house! I bought mine at Walmart, for much less money, and for us, it was a great buy. They are now almost a year old and it's still one of their favorite play things."
4,Helped Teach My Son to Walk,"This toy definitely helped my son to walk. When we first go it, he just to love to watch the balls go through it and hit it to make it play music. Then when he started to walk, we had to hold the top to keep it from going too fast but in no time my son was walking around on his own. After that he loved to ride it, backwards mainly."
3,be careful if you buy this....,"be careful with this toy if your child is learning to walk. when you open it and have them hold on to push it, not only does it go fast but my son fell, hit his eye on a piece of plastic that sticks out & got a black eye - very scary & I felt very guilty even though I was right next to him. we put it away until he was more stable at walking & he still loves to ride it around at 2 1/2."
4,Lots of fun for beginner walker.,My son got this toy for Christmas. He wasn't even crawling yet but loved to put the balls in the basket to make the music start. Once he started pulling up it was a great walking toy. He loves to dance to the music now. It is a little difficult to change from the walking to riding position but my son isn't that interested in riding right now.
2,walker moves to fast.,"I got this for my sons 1st birthday. As of yet he won't attempt to try the walker feature anymore because everytime he's tryed to stand up and use it, it speeds off in front of him. It needs some resistance (maybe on carpet would be better?) Very disappointed because i got it for him to learn to walk. The sit ride on feature doesn't interest him to much either. He can push to go backwards but hasn't figured out going forward yet. The ball in the hoop hasn't clicked on to him either. The one thing he does love is the music and lights but that only attracts his attention for a very short while. I hope it grows on him as everyone else seems to love it."
3,"Only two design changes, but cute.","My little boy got this toy when he was 6 mths. and now he is 18 mths old and plays with it about once a month. However, I love that this toy has a hoop on it but, I just wish the balls would roll back to the front of the toy when you put them in the basket. Also when he was just learning how to walk he couldn't use this toy because it would run away from him. I just taped the wheels so they couldn't move and that worked better. Other than that the toy is much more enjoyable now that he is older."
4,This toy is still a hit one year later,"My daughter (now 21 months) got this toy for Christmas last year, and it has been a toy she's played with nearly every day. We leave it inside for her so on rainy days she can ride it inside. She used it as a walker while learning to walk - my only complaint with it as a walker is that it can sometimes get away from the child as it starts rolling too fast. However, she still loves riding on it - and still gets a big grin when she presses the nose and hears the music. Overall I would recommend this toy."
4,Fast but fun,"Great toy, but as others have noted, a little fast for beginners.My son loves the music and playing with the basket & balls. The wheels make for this toy are really stable, but watch out, while in motion it moves!! You may have to slow down for beginners, but it was great once my son got the hang of it."
2,parent of 1 year old and 3 three year old,"I was so excited for my 1 year old to practice walking with this toy, thinking that she would be so encouraged by the constant funky music. My 3 year old was ""helping"" me put it together for her. The problem was that the music only played when the nose button was pushed and not at any other time as it's supposed to do! The kids got bored with it within minutes. Unfortunately, once it's assembled, it can't be taken apart for return purposes so I lost my money. I would purchase another walker instead if I were you ( one that's returnable)."
2,"Baby Loves it, I think it's CRAP.","My baby boy loves this toy. I think the toy is unsafe without perental supervision. First of all, there is nothing to slow it down. My child starts walking with the toy, and then Zooooom, it's speeding away and my baby is falling down on his face and chest. Bottom line is that something need to be included that will slow the wheels down for baby's learning to walk. Second of all, if my child runs into something with the toy. . . say the chair, and keeps pushing, the toy will flip forward. This causes my child to fall forward, onto the toy, hurting himself. If your unable to totally supervise the baby while he/she is playing with this toy, don't buy it.... Really."
2,Horrible toy...,"My daughter received this toy when she was about 11 months old and we eventually had to throw it in the garbage!!! Every single time she bumped into the wall or a piece of furniture it would nose dive and she would end up with her belly in the ""v"" section of the walker flying like superman! I can't tell you how many times the toy flipped over and she was hurt and crying hysterically! I am seriously shocked at how many people love this toy!! Obviously it is top heavy and not very safe for a new walker! My opinion is save your money and try a different push-ride on toy."
3,Do Not use this toy outside,This walker is a little unstable and hard to use. My son sometimes pushes it while on his knees because it's hard stand up to use. If you use it in the grass and your lawn has any uneveness about it your child will likely flip the toy falling and potentially seriously hurting itself.
4,disappointing,"I purchased this toy for our son when he was 9 months old. He initially had difficulty steering it and controlling its speed. The wheels turn too fast on hardwood flooring but go nicely on rugs. The walker is difficult to turn thus resulting in the toy and my son toppling over when he wanted to turn a corner. The hoop and balls kept his attention, but after placing the balls in the hoop it is very difficult to retrieve them from the back if the walker is in ""walk mode."" This toy is difficult to convert from walk to ride and vice versa because the button sticks and the latch does not securely lock the seat parts together. My son does, however, love the music, lights, and button nose on the face. All in all, I would say, this toy is cute but I do not feel it really assisted my son in mastering any walking skills. If you are looking for a cute toy this is it, if you are looking for functionality this is not the toy for you."
4,cute walker toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was in the cruising stage. Unfortunatley, when she would ""walk"" behind it while holding on...the toy would zoom across the floor pulling her with it. And that was on the carpet!Now that she's walking, she enjoys playing with the balls and uses it to ride and climb on.What we like about this toy is the fact that the music can be turned off."
2,Not Useful as a Walker for all Children,My child could not use this as a walker. The protruding arms that are used later on for them to ride did not give her enough room to walk in between them. I took it back.
3,"noisy, wouldn't stay latched","My son received this present for Christmas when he was 6 months old. He was and has continued to be delighted with the basket and the balls. The 2 songs that the toy plays are short and aggravating after only a short period of time (luckily there is an ""off"" switch"".) We retired this toy when my son started to try riding it because the latch beneath the two arms wouldn't stay locked and he kept falling off of it. Also, he is now almost 2 and we a re drawn more and more to toys that offer more music variety and aren't quite so obnoxious."
4,He Loves It!!,"I bought this for my little grandson for Christmas. He loved sitting on it and being pushed. He is now 9 months old and walking behind it. The wheels are slick and it gets away from him. However, my daughter bought velcro for the wheels and now he can go anywhere. He loves it!!"
5,Great buy,"This toy is great. We bought this for our nine month old for christmas. Since she is now cruising along furniture we decided to give it to her early- and are we glad. She just absolutely loves it. She pushes this toy all over the place. She wore her little self out. The hoop feature is also a hit with my three year old. My only concern is that it may tip over depending how it's pushed, but my kids love it. I still think it's a great toy!!"
4,Good value for your money.,"I thought this was a great toy for my daughter, who is now 20 months and still plays with it. I originally got it for her when she was 9 months and it helped her walk. She enjoyed playing with the balls and dancing to the music. The music can tend to be loud and overwhelming, but can be turned off if necessary. She now loves to sit on it and ride it around the house. She still enjoys putting the balls in the basket and finding them in the back. I would definitely recommend this toy."
3,OK toy,I bought this toy for my son and he loved it at first but after a couple of days he wasn't really interested in it anymore. The wheels spin easily which makes him have to work harder to keep it from running away from him. The basket where he can put balls in is his favorite part. He uses it like a little shopping cart. I found a fisher price walker at a garage sale and he uses it as a walker daily. I've switched the stride to ride to the riding function and he sits on it but doesn't know how to make it go yet. All in all it's an okay toy but I wouldn't purchase it again. I'd get the fisher price one instead because the wheels have resistance so it doesn't run away from him and he can turn it easier.
2,Be careful with this toy!,"I bought this for my 10-month old daughter who was just starting to pull up on everything in the house. I thought this toy would be great to help her walk. But the wheels are extremely slick and have no traction (do NOT use on tile or wood floors) and have absolutely no resistence to them. Every time my daughter would try and pull herself up using this toy it would start rolling backwards and if I helped her stand and hold onto it the wheels rolled so quickly when she tried to walk forward that the toy would get away from her. That really frightened her! Also, the music is annoying and LOUD, without a volume control and the slightest little thing sets this toy off.Overall, the concept is OK, but if you do get this toy (which I do not recommend) make sure you hold onto it at ALL times when your child is playing with it if they are standing or else they are going to fall on their face when the toy rolls away from them."
1,Not good. Doesn't Turn. Goes too fast.,"Bought this for my daughter when she was starting to cruiseShe was never able to use it to walk bc it goes too fast. She did enjoy sitting on it, but it was pretty useless since it can only go straight and a 1+ yr old isn't really capable of figuring out how to get up and turn it around manually. She would end up riding on it until she could go no further and then just getting up and walking away. It has been a thoroughly diappointing purchase. . I have only one positive comment: the two tunes it plays are cute --but annoying-- and they can be turned off. But that is not a reason to buy this one. I recommend either buying one with steering control, or a walker that doesn't go as fast. I'm sorry that I can't recommend another option, but at least I can warn you not to waste your money on this one."
3,Not as Good as Others,"I bought this one and ended up returning it in exchange for the Little Tikes Activity Walker. It has adjustable speed, and it is less expensive. It does require more assembly, but I'm glad I have it now instead. The Stride to Ride Walker does have some good qualities, such as music and being able to change to a ride on. But there are also better ride ons that teach children to steer better. The parts that divide to create a walker are just in the way, and my son would trip on them. Plus it goes SO fast, my son would just get going too quickly and drop to his knees or worse on his face. When I got the Little Tikes Activity Walker, he loved it much more, and I could start it out slower so he would get going too fast."
4,"Good toy, but be careful.","Be very careful when introducing your little one to this toy. The wheels move quite quickly, and since beginning walkers tend to lean all of their weight onto a device for support, it is very easy for the toy to just ""go"" and slip out from under them. Also, make sure to use this toy on carpet. If your home has tile, wood, or marble floors, they will not provide enough traction and the wheels will go too fast."
4,Wonderful & Versatile Walker,"I bought this for my twins when they were about 9 months old. They absolutely loved this walker! The music starts when moved as an incentive for the baby to get up and get going. After my girls learned to walk well, we pushed the legs together and it makes a ride-on toy. It's a little unstable this way so make sure your toddler won't hurt herself/himself if it tips over. The only other drawback is that the batteries drain very quickly. If I remember correctly we were changing batteries every couple of weeks."
2,Horrible walker,"As a mother of 4, this was our worst walker. Too small for them to actually use as a stabilizer when learning to walk. Then, too small to use as a ride on. The legs open to walk, close to ride. When open there wasn't enought room to step. While the music & lights were entertaining, all of our other toys are too! The worst part is that when put the ball in the front, it comes out underneath in the back. Our kids always cried wondering where the ball went. We highly recommend the very simple little tykes car as a very strudy ride-on/walker. It comes in pink or blue with the right hight handles on the back for pushing, it won't tip over, & is big enough to use a ride-on!"
3,Not that great of a walker.,My mother bought this toy for my son when he was learning how to walk. It is ok to sit on but I would not recommend it to use as a walker. The two legs are too close together for a child to actually be able to walk properly with out hitting it. My son had more fun playing with the balls and the music than actually using this as a walking toy.
2,flopped,"We bought this toy as a walker for our son to aid him. The wheels have no way of slowing down the walker so it didn't help him at all. If he leaned on it, it just moved out from under him while he was trying to hold on for support. Also with the seat in the ""apart"" position, it's impossible for the child to stand close to the handle bar so his hands are way out in front of him trying to hold on. And then it just zips out from under him. I'd say if you want a ride-on toy, then it's fine. If you want assistance for learning to walk well, pick a different toy."
4,Great toy for motivated babies.,I purchased this for my nine month old son about a month ago and he is yet to get bored..unlike most of his toys.He loves the catchy-tunes and the walker is durable enough for both outdoor and indoor use.My only advise is wait until your child is steady on thier feet and confident enough to let go of the couch!This toys wheels are fast and a child with less confidence could quickly lose balance and crash to the floor. But with the right amount of confidence this toy is great and gives your child the independece they desire...until they can walk unassisted! And get ready to be picking up the balls all day long!
5,has been through 6 kids so far!,"We have had this toy since my 3 year old was a baby. All 6 cousins have played with it, and it's still kicking. I love how it converts from a ""walker"" to almost like a trike. The lights and sounds are entertaining for everyone in the room, even the adults. The latch is not easy enough for the kids to change it from open to closed, which is almost better so that they don't pinch themselves. Overall, very sturdy and fun!"
3,Fast rolling noise maker,"This was the first walker we bought for my son when he started to stand on his own. Unfortunately, we did not use the ""walker"" option for long, because it rolled faster than he could walk. So, we changed the position so he could sit and ride on it instead. It has very loud, manic music, and no one in my family could stand it for very long (except for the baby). Fortunately, there is an off button. If you're looking for a walker, I think the Gobbling-Go Hippo is a much sturdier, safer toy."
4,Fun for everyone!,"We just bought this for my daughter (8 months old). I thought it was a bit early for her, but my husband loved it. She is already walking behind it and loves to hear the music play. She just figured out that the balls go in the front and stay underneath. The balls are small enough for her to hold and also to roll under the couch. We've already lost one of them - OOPS! When she starts getting into something she shouldn't, we push the nose and start the music and she comes right to the walker!"
4,TOO FAST FOR A BEGINNER,I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she was afraid of it after she tried to hold on. It went so fast she immediatly let go and hadn't played with it for a long time. She is now 10 months and she started to play with it. She is more stable and can walk as fast as the walker can go. I think this toy is more for a 10 month old than a 9 month old.
2,Difficult and annoying,"The music sensor is TOO sensitive. You walk on the floor a little too hard the annoying music goes off! I don't mind the musical toys at all but this one is ANNOYING. The balls should go toward the front once they roll into the basket. My almost 12 month old couldn't find them. He looked in the front. It is not easy to walk with or ride on. It is VERY DIFFICULT to move the blue seat apart to become a ride on or a walker. It is most difficult to pry the legs apart to make it a walker. My strong husband had a difficult time. He's an engineer and said it is not designed well at all. This also tips over easily. My son was behind it and the music went off, he bent forward to find the music and he went head over heals with the toy on top of him. I gave it 3 stars for durability because we haven't had a problem with it falling apart but it tips easily to me that's not durable."
2,Falls over easily,"My 10 month old got this walker as a gift. She loves it, but I stopped letting her use it because I think it is dangerous. It has fallen on top of her a few times. The last time she fell, her legs got entangled in the sides of the walker and she hit her head on the floor. That was the last time she will ever use it."
1,Item should be redesigned or recalled,"I got this when our baby was 5-6 months old. He enjoyed sitting on it and pushing it around. Unfortunately as other parents have reviewed this item, you cannot leave you kid alone when he/she is riding on this since he can easily topple over. It is light in a sense that my baby just lifted the whole thing with one hand! Also, the wheels have nothing to slow it down that it moves faster than your baby can walk. He/she will end up squat on his face if he/she lets go. If the front wheel hits a snag, it becomes a pivoting point then the whole body acts like a trebuchet toppling your baby forward.If you can fully supervise your baby, this is a good one otherwise I would not recommend it. We had to return ours for the sake of safety of our baby."
4,A lot of fun,"My duaghter loves this toy. She received last Christmas, too late for a walker, but perfect timing for riding. She has so much fun pushing or trying to push herself around the living room. She likes pushing the nose to make the lights and music go off (thank goodness, there's a volume control and a off button)."
3,Not the best walker for learning,We bought this walker for our son when he was starting to walk. At 11 months it is still way too fast for him. He loves the music but it simply rolls too fast for him to walk behind without either my husband or myself holding onto it. I hope that he will be able to use it as a ride-on toy a little later but I'm disapointed in it as a walker. Perhaps if they added some sort of tension to the wheels?
2,Not what we expected!,"I purchased this walker as a christmas gift for my 9 mo. old son. I wanted a toy that would aid in his learning to walk as well as a fun toy. After assembling (which was very simple), we found that this toy's lightweight frame and lack of tension on the large wheels causes it to go too fast and the child to topple forward. This toy is NOT MADE FOR BEGINNERS...BEWARE!!"
3,Good short movie should have been longer,This is another good starter for someone who is interested in knowing about the early start of anime. Also the price is good that you will not have to spend as much. Nice plot of someone wanting power.
2,disapointed,"im giving two star for the begginning of the movie. as i started to get interested in the movie, it ended. very dissapointing.."
5,Another great workout from Wai Lana,"Wai Lana offers the very best of the Yoga DVD's. She's absolutely my favorite!This workout has a faster pace than the Hello fitness series, but is still true to her Eastern roots. By the end you'll be groaning in pain (in a good way) while feeling utterly relaxed.This is a great addition to the Hello Fitness series. If you are a follower of all things yoga, you will love this!"
5,shocking sneakers,"beautiful design, very nice choice of colours (white/ green/ gold), very confortable, 10 points"
1,The worst among my phuchases,"There are no explanations at all on the answers. The answers are only A.B.C.etc. They did not tell you ""why"". Besides, the CD sound quality is so bad, and you can not repeat the specific questions you want to listen. You have to repeat the whole section from the beginning, and it wasts my time.It can't even compare to Delta's Key to TOEFL(CD-ROM)(5*) and Barron's TOEFL 10th Edition(4*),"
4,Good!,"It was delivered earlier than I expected. This tennis ball hopper is really great for those who are practicing by themselves without playmate. Good thing about this is that you don't have to bend to pick up the ball. All you have to do is place it on the ball on the ground, push it gently, and the ball pops up. Actully I didn't know by the time I got this but this is really good function it has. Frame is not as sturdy as I want. It should be good enough, though."
2,Loose Lid and Handles Have No Clip to Stay Together :(,"After reading the reviews, I bought this hopper. The price is great and it felt pretty solid as I assembled it, but then noticed that the top lid does not latch down or close tightly. This is a problem because if you put this in the car and it tilts over... all the balls will come out. Second issue is the handles/legs when folded upward for carrying have no latch to keep them together. When I first attached the handles/legs then sat it in the carrying position, about 10 seconds later one of the handles fell down and broke my dog's bowl on the floor. I knew right then that it had to go back. I am now looking for one with a tight lid and a latch for the handles. Hope this helps you :)"
1,Disappointed,I was unable to play this movie because it was set up for Europe not USA . Really wish I knew that. It was a gift.
2,What the Hell?!,"I am SO INTO 80's horror movies, slasher flicks, even low budget kinda cheesy fun killer movies. I bought this because it received good reviews, lots. Well, I was disappointed big time. This movie sucked. It really didn't deliver too much in the gore and action department. I just hate when something is so built up and doesn't deliver."
2,Really Low Budget B Movie,"Another addition to the Christmas Genre and not a good one at that. So far ive seen 'Christmas Evil'- bad, 'Black Christmas'- not so bad and now 'Silent Night Deadly Night' - pretty damn bad.It's about a kid who witnesses his parents murder on Christmas Eve. The guy who commits the crime is dressed as Santa Claus. Then when the boy is all grown up he starts having flashbacks and remembers the incident and goes crazy every time he sees Santa Claus. He ends up dressing up as a Santa Claus and has a compulsion to punish those that are 'naughty'.I enjoyed the actor who played the Santa Claus lead character even though the acting was terrible and the story didn't turn out too good or make a lot of sense. Even though it was bad I enjoyed it somewhat. Barely entertaining, even among horror movies this one ranks pretty low."
3,not bad,seen it when i was really young then it was band for years. movie kinds sucks but i had to have it anyway.
2,Trashy.,"People made such a big commotion about this film when it first came out. We follow the life of a young boy, Billy, his harsh & cruel past...& the reasons that make him turn into a Psychotic Serial Killer (dressed in a Santa suit). Some portions of the film maybe disturbing to some viewers, it's better that you keep it away from children. Bad/low budget filmmaking, but overall has an effective feeling/atmosphere.This was the weakest slasher film of it's generation."
3,a cult classic!,"Silent Night, Deadly Night is the christmas movie nobody wanted us to see. When it came out it was protested, for having Santa Clause as a killer. One christmas eve a family is off to visit there grandfather in the nursing home, on their way home a man in a Santa Clause custume ends up killing Billy and Ricky's parents. The event tramatizes Billy, he hates Santa and Christmas. Years later Billy gets a job at a department store, and has to dress in a Santa Custume. Billy then snaps and goes on a murderous rampage. We getta see some creative killings. Overall a good movie."
5,I love this movie,All I can say about this film is that it is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The movie takes you from the beginning of this child's life all the way til adulthood where he goes crazy in a Santa suit and starts killing people. I strongly recommend this film for all B movie horror lovers
4,Easy to overlook,"Here is a bizzare little horror film that few seem to have seen. I came upon this film in a video store in my area that is now out of business.This is quite a disturbing and enjoyable film which puts the killer in the beloved santa claws outfit, with some creative death scenes reminicent of both the Friday the 13, and Halloween series. If you are an avid fan of horror, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. This is a forgotten gem with an interesting take on one of America's biggest holidays.I would suggest that you don't waste your time with any of the sequels, however if you are like me and have a morbid as well as a sick curiosity, may I suggest the second of the series as this proved to be the most tolerable in my opinion."
3,Silent night deadly night,Being a horror movie buff this was kinda cheesy and not really that scary Im glad I didnt pay to much to rent it.
2,"Silent Night,Boring Night","Dull,Boring crap.The actors are so bad they could not get a job on a Soap Opera.You do not care who gets killed.Its a shame the last two victims where not the director and the writer of this junk.Watch Black Christmas instead"
3,Offensive but controversial,"After witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a crook dressed as Santa Claus, and his subsequent (and sadistic) orphanage experience, 18-year-old Billy is confused this Christmas Eve. After having to dress as Santa Claus at the toy store where he works, he suddenly snaps and kills his four co-workers during their after hours party. And he's just getting started. Watchable, with some originality, but the film's reputation rests on the fact that this was picketed outside theatres where it played and tv ads were pulled shortly after."
2,If you have the previous release then don't get this,"This DVD is the exact same one that was released a few years ago with only one difference, it does not have part two on the flip side. The case may be different, but the DVD is exactly the same. I admit that I really don't like the sequal very much, in fact it is one of the worst sequals that I've ever seen, but if you have the previous disc then by all means hang on to it unless you simply want to get rid of part two. The main thing that was disappointing about this reissue was that it claims to have a theatrical trailer as an added bonus feature, but unfortunately that turned out to be a lie. There is no trailer and the extras like everything else on this DVD are exactly the same as before."
4,purchased as a gift!!,"This little book was purchased as a gift, and so I have not had the opportunity to read it yet!!"
3,OK but......,"I enjoyed the stories. While they were indeed interesting, I think they fell short in research. Talk about a quick read!"
3,OK Book.,Kind of basic. If I lived in the area Id probably have gotten more out of the story. The insidents took place a while ago and dont have the same impact as if they happen last year. Still a well writen book and it did give me some things to think about next time I go camping.
5,Involved in the mysteries.,"We bought the book at a gift shop in the mountains on our vacation in Blairsville GA. My 10 year old niece and my sisters and I took turns reading the stories out loud on the deck of our cabin each evening. Simple stories, well researched, and intriguing, the stories stirred up much suspense and long discussions. Since the stories include maps and detailed locations of the disappearances, we went to some of the sites to enrich our discussions of what we each theorized happened...a dramatic way to ""feel"" a part of solving the mysteries. We will probably visit more of the sites in the future."
5,Brought Back Memories,"As I read the stories in this book, my heart went out to those who lost a loved one, and yet have no closure. My heart pumped harder when I read about Dennis Martin, the six year old, because when I was about his age my parents took me to the Smokies. I had a tendency to wander off, and one time I was lost for about an hour. I sat down and cried, then got up and yelled. My dad, who was looking for me, heard me; if he had not I may have been in this book."
5,Unsolved Disappearance of the Smoky Mtns.,"Great seller, quick delivery. The book is very informative as I am very familiar with the locations written about in the book."
3,I would like more info,this was a slow read and not what I thought it would be. I would like to read a little more of the diappearances.
5,One of her best,"Another first-rate album by Rory Block, with some pieces that do an exceptional job of highlighting her singing (particularly ""The Golden Vanity""), and with a sufficient sampling of her Delta blues songs to keep the regular fans satisfied. If you've never heard her before, do yourself a favor and have a listen."
5,My nephew loves it.,I gave this to my 18 month old nephew as a christmas gift. He loved crawling through it and standing up in it and making it pop up and down as well. My sister in law likes it because it helps him get out some of his energy without running all over the house.
5,I actually got it for my Jack Russell Terrier,"And she loves it. So, I got one for my 2 yr old grandson too and he loves it too. Very sturdy, easy to put away, ok to leave out in the rain. I highly recommend it."
5,great toy,"I just bought this tunnel for my two year old daughter. Her nursery school has the neon see-me connecting tunnel, and she just loves it. They didn't have that one at our local [store], so we bought the 6' Find-Me Play Tunnel. I think this tunnel will last a long time. My kids have already jumped on top of it, and the dog even tried to crawl through. It seems to be quite durable and is not made of cheap plastic like some of the less expensive tunnels. It's definitely worth the extra money."
5,Keeps 6 & 8 year olds entertained for hours!,"P & F keeps my 6 year old daughter & 8 year old son entertained for hours! I haven't personally watched the episodes, but they watch them over and over again!"
4,"Mom, Phineas & Ferb Are Charging Too Much!",This is a great show but what's going on with the ridiculous pricing for these seasons? The HD versions are insanely overpriced. $90 for one season?
3,High energy blues,"Playing this album for the first time in some years I initially wondered why I bought it until I heard again 'Up all night thinking' which highlights how good Dave Hole can be. That track alone is worth the price of the CD with brilliant blues slide guitar work. 'Key to the highway' is also quite good but much of the rest of the album is too frantic for my current tastes. Alot of the tracks are like hearing Roy Buchanan on steriods with his liking for the high notes. As I said in my review of ""Short Fuse Blues', Dave's energy often exceeds his talent. As an aussie myself, I applaud his success, but I probably will never buy another album from him."
5,I hope they don't go mainstream,"In a nutshell these guys are the total package, for anyone who saw them barbershop at the CD release party you know they are all that and a can of corn. Please don't tour with anyone too big fellas, put out 5 more albums and play the Tractor Tavern in Ballard every month. This album will grow on you and make you want to buy it for all your friends....."
3,Moonlight Shadow,"Well, naturally, I gave up on gay psychics and gay cops, favoring something a bit more fun. Werewolves. Due to past experiences with gay original fic, I wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I wasn't disappointed. Now, I'll go ahead and state that this book went -real- light on plot, but I've found that to be true with most of these types of stories. I will say that there was at least one character that I did NOT like, which is saying something. Why? Because I actually felt something for some of the characters. What was worse, IMHO, is that he got the -best- guy outta all of them! Guh! Where's the justice in that? If you're looking for a quick, porny read, I recommend this book. If you're looking for werewolf plot.... Well, I have no idea where to look for that, but I'm sure there's something out there with it. I will warn you, though. When it comes to the sex, it strikes me as border-line bestiality, which was... uhm. *twitch* Dude, he's in werewolf form sometimes!"
2,Disappointing,"I think had this book been labelled ""romantic erotica"" instead of romance, I would have been less disappointed with the story. Because having the characters say 'I love you' a lot doesn't make it a romance (especially when they've known each other for all of a day)! Both Connor and Adam felt very 'flat' to me- there wasn't anything to differentiate them from the surrounding characters, and the surrounding characters weren't painted all that vividly either. It's hard to get into a story like this when you don't care what happens to the characters. The heavy-handed exposition and info dumping was also quite irritating, as was the fetishization of aboriginal people."
4,Out There in the Alaskan Night,"This is worth the money and the time to read it. Creative story telling with realistic characters, unusual setting and plot. I could hardly put it down. This take on werewolves, Native Americans, Alaska and gay men was a really enjoyable read. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,HOT SEXY WOLF,"Out There in the NightThe story is set in the outer reaches of Alaska, the characters are well developed and likeable. The storyline is the romantic progression of how Native American Adam who is the alpha werewolf and Dr. Conner Jacy a human and Adam's destined mate, find each other. The story gives just enough background for the story to make sense. a little drama leading up to the mating and a intense love scene exhibiting Conner's transformation into werewolf. This is a well paced story with a touch of intrigue, heartwarming and a few explicit sex scenes. The secondary characters adds interest and helps to define the main characters. The story is a Happy ever after with an opening left for a sequel. Overall this is an excellent werewolf story."
4,A Good Way To Spend An Evening,"**spoiler alert** Pros: The Native American shifter, and the mythos woven into the story, is amazing. The flow of words, the narrative itself, the imagery -- all beautiful and engaging. The characters are lovely, believable, and you really are swept up in their story. I like being swept up.Cons: I have an issue when irreversible changes are done to a character without all the consequences adequately explained outside of a sexual situation. It reeks of dubious consent. And the fact that Conner isn't as angry at having choice ripped away from him as one would expect leaves me with that 'WTF' feeling."
5,EXCELLENT !!!!!!!!,"I have read a lot of books with M to M Writing. These books that she writes are very sensual and have a great story line. I enjoyed every moment of this book and all the others that she has written. It was absolutely wonderful. Her writing is very smoothe and constant. Her characters just flow together. A lot of the man on man books that I buy they are more for the sex then the romance, with hers there is both. I am definitely buying and more books that come out by her. I read different reviews about her books, but if you just read them and stop trying to be so critical of them you would enjoy them more. The only regret I have is that she does not write faster so that I can buy them.WAY TOO GO.Keep doing what you are doing and let no one stand in your way."
3,Flesh & Blood Review,"I choose this ratinig because it was an OK movie. Some action started out, but became too slow in content. Storey not all that plausible. Action scenes were ok, but could be better. This, however, is not for young individals. They is some bloody and sensual scenes. I would recommend it still."
3,Good movie but inappropriate musical score,"The movie itself is interesting in its description of amoral behaviors, selfishness, and greed in a world with no rules (during the 16th century). However, the bestiality of the characters in the movie is totally contradicted by a symphonic music which would be much more appropriate to acts of bravery than to acts of debauchery and murder. This creates the feeling that the massacres here perpetrated are actually in some form heroic actions and that viewers should cheer at the sight of looters burning up a whole city. This music (and probably some directorial decisions too) dilutes the possible message of the movie and transforms it into a blockbuster for adults. This movie is another missed attempt by Verhoeven to make an uncompromised movie with a strong stance."
1,Although Paul Verhoeven...,"...has made more than a few fine movies, I couldn't bear more than 10 minutes of this one. The first thing I did loathe was that, during this time I didn't hear one single sentence that could have been uttered in 1501. And the feeling I got is everything said was recorded in some gutter in 1984 by some low-life creeps disgracing what is supposed to be ""Mankind"". I don't suppose either that he tried to make some sort of spoof, since spoofs are usually funny, and the best are even very accurate in the details. To qualify this crap as disapointing would be more than an understatement."
1,SUCKS.,"The only reason I purchased this movie was because I heard Jenifer Jason Leigh was nude in it. I read some of the reviews for this before buying it and it sounded half way decent. But after watching it I came to realize that whoever wrote most of those reviews had to be huge Rutger Hauer fans because this movie sucks. The acting sucks, the direction sucks, the writing sucks. The only good content is Jenifer Jason Leigh's nude scenes, and there are quite a few. This is a great movie to watch on mute."
1,HUH?????,"Can SOMEone PLEASE explain why the ""free preview"" is NOTHING but opening credits?????? Can the STUPID people PLEASE stop running Amazon video on demand??!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!"
4,"Gritty, realistic look at history","This is not a nice movie, anyone who expects a nice period piece will go away shocked. The history of mankind is marked by frequent conflicts and attrocities. This movie explores the motivations that spawn such terrible acts of war and retribution. The Rose & the Sword was originally and more appropriately entitled ""Flesh and Blood"". The morals of this movie are some of the most accurate that I have ever seen portrayed in a period piece, life was often sold very cheaply. The costuming and the sets are very well done and the fictional storyline is believable. If you can get your hands on this movie and you have a strong stomach I highly recommend it to you."
5,A treasure to be rediscovered someday in re-release.,"This is a MUST SEE for fans of Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rutger Hauer, and director Paul Verhoven. It's shocking to find it's out of print. Fans of Jennifer Jason Leigh will LOVE her portrayal of an intelligent and sensual heroine who turns the tables on her abductors. Rutger Hauer's gritty ""fallen knight"" portrayal is the dark flipside of ""Ladyhawke's"" romantic captain. Paul Verhoven's directing is honest and straightforward and courageous, with faith in the intelligence of his audience."
4,"GREAT MIDEVIL TALE, LIVES UP TO ITS TITLE","Flesh and Blood has plenty of two things, flesh, and blood. Eyefulls of skin, in fact, most of it being every inch of a young Jennifer Jason Liegh. There are buckets of blood and gore as well, running the gamut from sword piercings, to burning, to oozing sores. Titilation aside, its a decent movie. While the acting isnt outstanding, the story and action still hold up, and the movie does a what it should, entertain.Its a shame this movie has been forgotten. Out of the glut of Middle Age's themed movies that came out in the 80's, right after Conan the Barbarian was a hit, this is probably one of the best, up there with Ladyhawke (also starring Rutger Hauer). The movie was diercted by Paul Verhoven, best known for Robocop, Basic Instinct, Showgirls, and Starship Troopers."
4,Making history sex,"Probably, it is a realistic story of England and its history-in-making where nonenties make a go on nobelties to feel better a bit and to have something at last.Sex, group rape, more sex and blood,blood, blood-pre-history of human rights and progress of civilization."
2,"Kiss Kiss, Hack Hack!","I love Verhoeven's early work and he's done fine period pieces (""Soldier of Orange"" is great for example) but this is the kind of movie his critics are always accusing him of making: a gratuitously, pointlessly, sadistically sexual, ultra-violent comic book. There sho-nuff is a lotta bare n' bloody boob-age... if that's whatcha want then knock yourself out, but to me it's precious Verhoeven wasted!"
5,Inna nutshell:,A swashbuckling movie with a believable plot; a realistic glimpse into the medieval mindset; the horrors of warfare exposed; the truth about `christendom' and a flick full of good-looking euro-trash!See it!
4,A romance novel captured on film. Rutger Hauer at his most handsome finest.,"I first watched this movie as a teen and immediately fell in love with Rutger Hauer. Make no mistakes this is a saucy movie and although it's not rated, in my mind it has always been an R. I will always feel a little cheeky and naughty as I sneek a watch at this movie. The nakedness the intimate scenes the look in their eyes speaks volumes. If you love to read romance novels then this is a movie for you. Mr Hauer can always turn those baby blues my way."
5,Good Movie,"I purchased this movie for my Husband. He had been talking and looking for this movie for about the last year. So I looked on Amazon and found it. I personally had never seen it until we got it from Amazon. It is a good movie. There were a spot or two that I wasn't all that thrilled with. But over all the movie portrayed a more realistic view than all the ""fairy tale"" movies of the same period of time."
2,unfair!!,"The title is unfair, because it leads you to think that you will actually have a solid vocal lessons book on heavy metal,It ain't true. the book should have been titled ""Interviews with heavy rock singers"". Now ""Bill Martin"" who ever you are, your book !!sucks!!. If the title would have been another, then it probably wouldn't suck. I wish somebody would write a real book on heavy rock singing. There are a lot of kids outhere that would love to learn this technique, and it is not fair that jerks that aren't even singers, take advantage of this by putting misleading titles to there books just to sell them."
3,Be advised on what you buy,"I agree with Gregg in previous review. The book (or should we call it a magazine?) consists mainly of interviews with rock stars on techniques they're using. There are no vocal lessons as stated in description. If you're looking for vocal excersizes, this is not quite the book.The picture of the product is deceptive - it's actually white, with the fill of what's displayed here and this fill takes on only 1/3 of the front cover.Again, I agree, the title should be changed."
1,A+ film for people with no frontal lobe,"I like watching movies, but I HATE acting and LOATHE coherent plots, so you can imagine that there aren't too many films out there I actually enjoy. Thank goodness for Actor Slash Model!I mean, just the other day I was complaining that too many films waste time with compelling characters and don't have enough footage of hunky guys walking around aimlessly and maybe working out or something and then getting stabbed off-camera. Well, that was the sickness, and Actor Slash Model is the cure!This film is perfect for those quiet afternoons when you have literally done everything else there is to do on this planet, nay, this universe. Dear god, I am burning up with fever and the prescription is more Actor Slash Model."
4,easy to follow,"This is an ""easy to follow"" instructions book. With many pictures, and some details I could reproduce the little sugar sculptures."
4,Magical!,"As soon as I got this book, I started getting orders for the cakes in it. I have been using it a lot for little girls' birthday cakes. My only dissatisfaction [and this is minor] is that I would have liked it to contain a greater number of interesting cakes for little boys. Nevertheless it's a very good book - I am happy with it."
5,BEAUTIFUL CAKES!,"I GAVE THIS BOOK TO MY MOM LAST CHRISTMAS. MY CHILDREN AND MY NEPHEW WENT THROUGH AND PICKED OUT ALL OF THE CAKES THEY WANT HER TO MAKE, WHICH WAS BASICALLY ALL OF THEM. EVERY CAKE IS BEAUTIFUL. THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND IS ALL OF THESE ARE FONDANT CAKES, BUT MOST ALL DETAILED CAKES ARE. ALSO, IT IS NECESSARY TO USE A FIRMER CAKE, SUCH HAS A POUND CAKE FOR THE SHAPE TO HOLD UP. REALLY MOIST CAKE WOULD JUST CRUMBLE. MY MOM LIKED THIS BOOK."
2,"A lovely book, but a bit daunting for an amateur...","I purchased this book to get ideas for cake decorating which is something I just started doing. It was a lovely book and she's quite talented, but this was way out of my league, so I ended up returning it. The cakes were far too intricate and detailed for an amateur baker, in my opinion. I can't see myself doing anything nearly this complex anytime real soon and not without many more cake decorating classes!"
4,Enchanted cakes for children,"I love this book, the illustrations are beautiful. it provides in great detail everything you need to create any one of the cakes and there are stencils at the back of the book. If you are going to try to make one of these cakes you should give yourself a lot of time. I would recommend this book to the experienced baker."
4,Very Creative book,Full of creativity and imaginations...to support your idea and increase your level of expertise on how to create something unique on your cake
4,Wow,"If I were to do cakes, this is how I'd want to do them. The faces are a little to cute for my taste, but the work that goes into each one of Debbie's designs is amazing. Good photos, but this would be something I personally would have to take as a 'hands on' class first. For the baker that has lots of experience..good luck."
5,Behind the sofa again...,"Even in a fragmentary state, the four episodes (from 'The Moonbase' - episodes 2 and 4 - and 'The Wheel in Space' - episodes 3 and 6) on this tape represent two of the most genuinely eerie stories ever made. Don't believe me? Try watching in a darkened house at about 11pm with your suspension of disbelief lurking somewhere in the corner behind the cat. Still some of my all-time favourites, and something no fan of the early days of Doctor Who should miss. And after you've finished with Cybermen, go find 'Daleks: the Early Years' and 'the Troughton Years'. Well worth the time.(by the bye, if you really enjoy these, search the web for 'doctor who telesnap reconstructions' if you'd like a taste of what the full stories were like...)Support the BBC releases!"
4,If you like Troughton and the Cybermen (and who doesn't?...),"The BBC were very shortsighted when they methodically erased a great number of old Doctor Who episodes one by one. But what's done is done, and until unknown copies rear their heads (just happened a couple months ago) this is a wonderful way to see incomplete stories. There is unfortunately nothing more than a couple clips from ""The Tenth Planet"", but what remains of ""The Moonbase"" and ""The Wheel in Space"" is very fun to watch. The Cybermen truly blossomed in the Troughton years and this documentary/compilation truly expresses that. This is a good video to ahve, particularly if you are one of the many who loves ""Tomb of the Cybermen"", ""The Invasion"" and the Cybermen in general."
5,good product with reasonable price,"We are using it regular for training our kids. Obviously, it is doing a good job. Even my 4.5y old daughter can pick up the ball by herself."
4,can't beat this price,"decent product that does what it supposed to do. as the other reviewer mentioned, the top will pop open when laid on it side in the trunk of the care. This model costs about twenty dollars more in a sporting goods BM store."
4,Decent hopper for price,It's an acceptable hopper for the $20 I paid and at that price point well worth the money. downsides to this hopper are that the handles do tend to pop out if you aren't careful and it's best to pick up one ball at a time. Great for working on serves or training someone.
3,You get what you pay for,This is a bit unsturdy. Akward to pick up balls with. It does the job though. And for the price it's fine. It does NOT hold 75 balls. I counted 50 at the most and then they start to pop out and you have to pick them up again.
4,Great for the price,"I only play tennis occasionally with my 5 year old. This saves my back and nicely picks up and stores the balls. Great for the price. I did read the other reviews and install the legs inside the basket, and also scraped off the red sticker immediately. I use some velcro tape to hold the handles together when carrying, but the ball compartment has stayed closed for me, and it stands as well as any other ball hopper of it's type."
1,Check as soon as you receive it.,We purchased this item in late October for Christmas. We opened it today and this item had been crushed inside. It was also missing the top. The box had been popped back out and put in a nice shipping box. Customer service did work with us and allowed a credit after 30 days as a one time issue.
4,Good for it's price,This is just what I needed to start practicing more. Not very sturdy. Wobbles sometimes. But it's perfect for once or twice a week practice
4,Not bad but one suggestion,"The ball hopper is easy to use. Stucture is sturdy enough to carry around. However, one simple thing to add is a clip to hold handle/leg together when it folded to be stored in truck without banging."
2,Pretty Unsatisfied...,"(Disclaimer: I returned mine about a week after getting it)This hopper is pretty weak. The handles fall out of their holders constantly. When folded up the handles didn't touch either which made it awkward to carry. When I set it upright it didn't feel sturdy at all.On the plus side, when it wasn't falling apart it picked up the balls fine... so it had that going for it..."
4,HANDLES/LEGS DO NOT FALL OFF IF ATTACHED PROPERLY,The handles/legs are quite secure if properly attached. You need to first position the 2 handle/leg ends on the inside of the 2 vertical wires closest to the attachment tube on the basket. Then fit and insert the 2 handle/leg ends into each end of the attachment tube. The 2 vertical wires will prevent the handles/legs from falling out of the attachment tubes. When standing up the basket just push the handles/legs into position as far as it will go underneath the basket and you can feel a slight pressure from the basket to hold handles/legs into place. The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is that the instructions do tell you how to position the handles/legs properly for attachment and they should have additional plastic footings found on the underside of the basket attached on the handles/legs as well. This would give the handles/legs a better footing when standing up the basket as well as some protection. Overall a good hopper.
1,Gamma Tennis Hopper,"The arms/handles for the hopper do not stay on. While just in a sitting position with the arms up they continuously fall out of the holes. It is very frustrating as this one was just like the other gamma I have that is perfectly fine. Don't know what changed, but the handles do not stay in the holes. I am unhappy with the product."
3,Comes Incorrectly Assembled (Store),"Initially I had to agree with the other reviewer on that the legs fall off when moved from the handle position to the leg position or when you try to carry it. Allright, after reading some of the reviews I looked at the hopper again and indeed, there is another more difficult way of inserting the handles into the basket. That solves it. The legs are now secure. Alas, the hopper is shipped and sold incorrectly assembled and without any instructions."
4,Bravo Mandy,"I have to applaud Mandy Moore for trying something new. She takes a bunch of old classic songs from thr 70's and 80's and actually does them justice. While she has never had the powerful voice of Christina Aguilera or Kelly Clarkson, she has always had one of the more sweetest and prettiest voices. On Coverage, she has never sounded better. Using her voice to it's full potential, and it sounds wonderful, especially on the opening number Senses Working Overtime and the final track, first single Have a Little Faith in Me. Other highlights include her fun version of I Feel the Earth Move, and her sexy turn on One Way or Another.A few songs drag, but for the most part Mandy takes these classic songs and makes them her own while still staying true to the original versions as much as possible. A wonderful album worthy of becoming a classic in it's own right."
5,Moore!,"They say don't do a cover if you can't do it better; Mandy does it better! This is a great idea and I hope she puts out a double CD of cover tunes next time.Standout tracks:""I Feel The Earth Move"" Sounds great.""Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters"" My favorite, Mandy sounds amazing on this. Rember this, by Elton John, was used in Almost Famous in New York.""One Way Or Another"" She nails this song.""Anticipation"" Another great choice.I played it 10 times in my car, that's the highest praise!"
2,Needs Something Moore,"I am a fan of Mandy Moore and was excited to purchase her Coverage album. I love cover songs and adored the first single Have A Little Faith In Me so I went ahead and bought the album. It is so disappointing! I find myself bored by Mandy's vocals and cannot sit through the whole album. She chose some amazing songs but did not do many of them justice. They lack their original charm and energy. While I do understand that cover songs are often not as good as the original, Coverage is a wispy, dull attempt at reviving an era of energetic and exciting songwriting. I admire Mandy for doing an album so different than her peers, but I just wish she had put a little more energy and charisma into the album. The songs have powerful messages lost on less than powerful expression."
3,Amazing Songs/Good Voice,"Well, there is no denying that Mandy Moore has great taste in music. What an eclectic mix she has here! That is what compelled me to really listen to this CD. I never really was too excited about any of the music she released in the past, but this seemed to be her chance to break out of a mold and let the world know what SHE likes, not what some record label WANTS HER TO DO. I have to give her credit for that. All in all, however, while the songs are amazing (they are all great classics), I don't hear enough energy or creativity in her voice. I don't feel that this CD amazing at all. It is just okay. Just a girl with a pretty good voice singing some great songs. But that's okay, because the important thing is that she did it. She made a good choice and a good move, even if it isn't gonna make the earth move."
3,Oh Mandy,"At first I thought this was a cool concept. Then I thought this was someone's idea of what a cool record collection should sound like. Well, it isn't. It's abunch of annoying songs from the 70's and 80's that may have been good at the time (or maybe not). That said, the singing ain't half bad and it's kind of funny and I like Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters but don't ask me to listen to Honky Chateau or whatever its called. Who cares anyways. File under: irrelevant teen pop for young adults.Did I spell that right.Whatever."
3,a brave attempt,"The problem with cover albums is that few artists can make the material their own. Yes, Mandy has a wonderful voice and great aura about her, however, this album is lacking in several respects. First, the songs are barely updated, and when they are, tend to sound generic. For example; One way or another. And what she's done to I feel the earth move is simply sinful. On a good note, Have a little faith in me and The whole of the moon are great remakes. Mandy's voice shines in these two songs only. Hopefully, we'll get to hear more of her own material in the near future--she has such a wonderful voice."
1,unfortunate,"this cd in a whole was quite awful. although i give her props for trying to expose her young fan base to the greats of time past, i feel that she'd have done them all more justice if she just mentioned it in a interview."
2,Not That Great,"Nothing stands out about these songs. They are all bland and sound similar. ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" is the only one I liked. This is her worst album."
4,The Coverage and Media Hype Is To Be Believed,"This is actually a terrific album. I listen to most of the songs at least every day. Of course there are a couple of duds (""Moonshadow"", ""One Way or Another"") but then again I never liked the originals of those two. This is wonderfully compiled, and without another cheesy Beatles cover in sight. Tastefully recorded with a fresh song, this album is a staple for any true music fan. VERY different from her usual vibe, and hopefully a sound and direction that she will continue with. The only reason I give it less than a perfect rating is because they are recorded exactly like the originals, only it's Mandy Moore singing. In other words, she uses the same ""Oohs"" and ""Yeahs!"" as the original artists. If she had explored her own voice more and given the songs a more personal twist, it would be perfect. But it's pretty darn close as it is."
3,Do me a favor...,"buy & listen john hiatt's ""bring the family"" - ""have a little faith in me"" is on this album & it is simply one of the best albums ever recorded. I have to admit that I do not like Mandy Moore's remake - now, having said that, those of you that love it, owe it to yourself to discover the original. I have not heard anything off this album other than that single, so I can't comment on the rest. It seems (from the reviews here) she has nailed it - well, done! I will strongly recommend shawn colvin's ""cover girl"" - i'm not a shawn colvin fan - where she nails this ""concept"" better than any i've heard. So, in closing, I'm glad everyone is enjoying this and I hope it inspires folks to check out the originals - especially john hiatt - happy listening."
5,tony's rating,"it took alot of guts to go back to the 70's for this album. but mandy really nailed it, whole of the moon, put a liitle faith in me and drop a pilot were A+, every songshe did great. i hope the album is a big seller,it deserves to be."
5,Mandy Rocks!,Well at first when i herd it i was like wow mandy you sunk low...but then i listened once more and i loved it. and i think this is outta the park. Best mandy has done. And i got to watch the DVD but i'm sure it's going to be great. Mandy can do no wrong and all should think so!
4,Mandy's Brilliant!,"She's beautiful, talented, and dares to be different. I would support Mandy ANY DAY over sluts like Britney and Christina! ""Coverage"" is a simply ingenious album. It's hard to believe that an Elton John song could sound SO GOOD sung by a teenage girl, but it's true. ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" is beautiful, my fave song on the disc, and every other song deserves just as much praise. GO MANDY!"
1,Nice thought but too weak,"in the age of the overblown Rod Stewart&Clay Aikens trying to Romance a Era gone by with very Sub-Par Results add another victim to the list.Mandy Moore.now Mandy Moore Vocally is closer to Jessica Simpson,&Christina,Monica,Beyonce,but Mandy's material is Lite in the Booty.Her Material ain't no threat to Vocal Light Weights like Brittney,J-Lo,Ashanti&Others.the concept of Her doing this&at Her Age being aware of the Past because lets be real:Most Peeps coming along today are pushed by the Media&other sources as thinking that Old School is Last Summer&this is Offically the Fall now.Mandy doesn't have enough juice to make Her take on these Songs Believable fully.now in any 20 years She might be a bit more Seasoned&She might find that Connie Francis Element She has in Her.stay tunned."
2,Bleh,"I love Mandy, but this cd sucks. The songs have a cheapened feel to them, and they sound as though they were rushed through. I was disappointed she didn't do her own music. I mean, these are great songs, but Mandy's voice is just not strong enough for them, and the music sounds canned and low-budget. All in all, poor renditions of great songs. Not worth buying."
2,Could have been........,"With gleeful anticipation I purchased this cd hoping to hear some wonderful reinditions of some excellent songs. Boy, was I dissappointed!There are twelve cuts on this cd, everything from Joan Armatrading to Blondie. Clearly the best cut here is a wonderful cover of John Hiatt's ""Have a Little Faith in Me"". After that, Carly Simon's ""Anticipation"" and E.John's ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"" round out all that is worthy of mention on this cd. Skip everything else. Besides a poor selection of songs and an even poorer performance, there is a feeling of being rushed through the music presented here. This just destroys any connection with the songs. A little less pace would have given more of a feel for the songs here. The quintiessential cover cd of the year is Michael McDonald's ""Motown"", this could have been in that league. But it isn't, skip it and wait for the next effort."
1,NO thanks,"I would never get this CD, and if you gave it to me as a gift, I'd throw it away. First of all, it's all COVERS! No original songs! Secondly, I don't like Mandy Moore's attitude as of late. She's acting like she doesn't like being a celebrity. I heard that Mandy said that she was ashamed of her first CD. That pisses me off, because your first CD is the one that starts you in the business and what makes you a star. So in conclusion, I don't like Mandy Moore, I don't like this CD, I will not recommend it to anyone, and I hope her career doesn't last much longer."
5,Mandy SHINES,This cd is AMAZING! It is pure fun! The confidence that Mandy had to cover these songs by such legends shows! I think every single artist that originally made these songs is/would be proud!!!! This album sets Mandy apart from her fellow pop stars! My favorite track is Have A Little Faith In Me. It's up there with Mariah's remake of I'll Be There. I highly recomend this CD for all ages!
5,beautiful,"Mandy Moore has created a wonderful album. Combining her awesome voice and the handy work of talented producers and mixers, this album is flawless. I also suggest checking out all the movies shes done....unlike other singers turned actresses, she actually CAN act, her charm sticks out. Go Mandy Moore!!!"
1,Karaoke....nothing more,"If you want to shell out ten bucks for a CD that is no better than the country western karaoke chick at your neighborhood bar, be my guest. That is the extent of this one...I guess the original songwriters are happy to cash the royalty checks from this CD, but they have to be embarassed with the final product. Some songs were perfect the first time...why does Mandy Moore of all people, think she needs to ""cover"" them? If you want to hear Joni, Carole, Carly, etc. in all their glory, buy their CD's. And support your local karaoke singer by dropping a nice tip in jar. But beware of this CD!"
2,American Idol Karoake,"As Simon Cowell would say: ""It was good. So what?!"" What I'm trying to say is that the songs on this cover album are good. In other words, Mandy sings them well. But there's nothing different that distinguishes these songs from the originals. If I wanted to listen to Blondie's ""One Way Or Another"" sung in Blondie's fashion, I would purchase a Blondie album. Mandy needs to take these classics and make them her own in a sense. For example, take a lesson from Britney Spears on her versions of ""The Beat Goes On"", ""Satisfaction"", ""You Got It All"" and ""I Love Rock 'n Roll"". You'll notice how she adds a little extra life into the songs and makes them new again. To me, that right there is the purpose of remakes. And unfortunately, the ""newness"" aspect of these covers is what is missing here."
2,Not great,"I agree with an earlier review in that the first three songs are not good and they sound the same. The rest is okay but not great. She definitely has a very good voice and could probably come out with an amazing cd someday, but this is not it. Some of the covers were pleasant to listen to but not one of them touched anywhere near the realm of the original singer's version. I would wait and buy a used copy if you're thinking of buying it."
2,I Like Her Previous Music Better,"Well MM is great. I loved her previous albums and it's nothing personal against her but i feel like she should have just done her regular stuff and not ""Cover"" other peoples music. Even though she feels people will get to know the artist a little well even though people hardly know who they are(Only one i know is Elton John). But i did hear samples of it and must say her vocals for the album are great and i'm glad she dished out another album i just wish she would have made a normal her own kind of music album not cover other peoples music. I might get the album or i might not depending how i feel. If i do get it it's only cause it's from Mandy Moore"
2,Disappointing....,"I've been a fan of Mandy Moore from the beginning, but that was way back in 2000. I was hoping that she would have evolved a little bit more being that it is 2007. This cd was not entirely a waste of money, but there were only 2 or 3 songs worth listening to more than once."
3,"I loved it, but...","I must confess two things before writing this review:1) I'm not a huge Mandy Moore fan. I don't listen to much of her stuff, but I like her nonetheless.2) I have only heard one or two of these songs, so I can't judge them on how good of covers they actually are.With that in mind, here I go.I really do love this album a lot. Almost every song had me hooked to the end (towards the end of the album I got a tad bored). They're energetic and catchy tunes. The only thing that I have this CD 3 stars for was...well, how to explain it? I just wasn't feeling Mandy's vocals. I know she has a beautiful voice, but I didn't get the impression that she was diversifying her sound very much with the songs. Of course each song's MUSIC sounds different, but I'm talking about her voice or the way she sings. The album just got a little breathy for me.Again, I will say, I love this album! It's a keeper. I reccomend it to you as well."
3,a Mixed Bag,"I have to give Mandy Moore credit for covering such an eclectic bunch of songs. She is absolutely a great singer ( although I think she's a better actress - she was great in ""Saved"" ). I don't listen to teen pop, so I've no idea how to compare this to any of her albums of original material. I have no problem with the fact that these songs are all covers versions, but I have to say the arrangements, vocal and instrumental, are too safe. They stick too close to the original versions, so it's hard to say they'd got the ""Mandy Moore"" stamp on them. It's all a bit sterile, a bit karaoke, for me to fully enjoy."
5,Surprizing,"I was surprized by this album. A young pop star daring to be different.Most other stars these days stick to the same formula and routine so you can't tell one from the other in regards to presentation,person or even CD...Mandy Moore is one class act..she took a series of songs from 30 years ago...not all of them that common and reworked them to make them her own....she also lets her voice stand on its own...there isn't alot of orchestration to drown out her vocals....love the covers of Carly Simon and Joni Mitchell(Help Me was like listening to the Joni Mitchell original all over again). Well done. Nice to hear an album that has meaningful lyrics and melodies and someone who has some vocal talent that is not reliant on how much of her mid-drift is showing"
4,Sparkling,These are lovely dainty sparkling earrings. Great for day or evening wear.Just wish the packaging said Swarovski Crystal. It would be more impressive whem giving as a gift.
4,1st reviewer is incorrect,"While Sony equipment allows great interoperability between Sony laptops, cameras, and other Sony gear, it is by no means at all difficult to connect to other equipment...The reviewer below indicates that Firewire is a Sony only protocol. Hogwash! IEEE 1394 is a multiplatform I/O option that allows you to connect to any firewire card available. This allow high speed transfer of digital video to any computer platform that supports it (ubiquitous today; PC, MAC, LINUX).Don't listen to the negative comments about interconnectivity. Sony gear also easily connects to USB devices. I can only conclude that the reviewer below had equipment that did not conform 100% to the standards for both USB 1.0 and IEEE 1394.This is good equipment, and worthy of your dollar."
4,Early Barretto and Adalberto,"Originally released in 1967, this album features Adalberto Santiago in one of his first albums with Ray after singing with Chuito Velez. There are pretty good tracks on here like ""El Picor"" and the great ""Fuego y Pa'Lante"" more of Barretto's better known style of salsa. There's also a very different version of ""Bilongo"" although a very good one with a very nice trumpet solo. Don't know who played it since the earlier Polydor release doesn't credit any musicians. Only muisician I'm sure about is Vilato on timbales. Trompeta y Trombon later remade by Fania All Stars is also on this album. Even Boogaloo con Soul is really good. Adalberto has one of the best voices of salsa and this track, even though not of my taste was saved by his singing. Overall, even though it has several boogaloos, very popular music at the time, it is still rather enjoyable for me as a salsero and I'm sure many will agree. A worthy acquisition."
4,Wonderfull,"A great stage compilation. Singers, musicians, stage performance... all well done to represent the spirit of far, distant and chilly Iceland. Modern sound and contemporary artists singing their lungs while musicians harmoniously pulling strings and banging drums. I liked it. HOWEVER! IF YOU WERE EXPECTING A SOLO Sigur Ros album - it is not. That is a compilation of various artists and Sigur Ros are only presented in the first and last pieces."
5,Magic from the North Atlantic,"To people, who are not familiar with the new music from Iceland and Faroe Islands, this cd is one of the best introduction for both countries.Tolkien gives you the visually image, and by listening to this cd you will get the rest. You will both hear and feel the magic of the mysterious North with wild landscapes, sagas, Northern light and siren song - here extremely well preformed in track no. 8 ""Brostnar borgir"" presenting the vocalist Eivr Pálsdóttir from Faroe Islands."
4,Interesting collection,"I really enjoyed the collection of work gathered in this. Each submission is so different, yet interesting. A solid listen with a nice broad spectrum."
2,Disappointed by the selection,"As with so many soundtracks these days, the best is left out. Despite the fact the majority of the selections were not of my taste, I was willing to buy it for ""Hrafnagaldur"" and its truly deep and haunting sound; however, those parts are omitted.The sound quality of the album is great, but that's of little value when one doesn't like what's on the CD. I have absolutely no desire to hear it again, and shall donate it to the local ""Friends of the Library"" Book sale."
4,Status of South Texas Birds,"An excellent overview of the breeding birds along the Rio Grande of South Texas. Covers historic status of most species unique to the region, if they have been documented to have bred there. Photos and artwork uneventful."
5,awesomeness for sponges,super awesome perfect for magic tricks all the way to the end this componys sponge balls are the ones im gonna use and some of the other things they make.
3,A lesson in not mending what aint broken,"It is a pity that what was one of the finest acoustic guitar albums of the 80's has, in this manifestation, lost the pulse in arguably the two strongest tracks, Santa Monica and Nice Feeling. The original vinyl recording was truly worth 5 stars, It had a swing and continuity to the piece but I gave it an average 3 stars because of this re-presentation. Having said that though, If you are new to this CD then you should view it as a 5 as you will not know what you have missed out on. It is still a cracking work and affords an elevated status in the corpus of acoustic guitar music and space in your collection."
4,Best Gift Ever,"I haven't slept for days. This is a great keyboard for the money! More voices, songs, and styles than one needs. The voices sound almost pro-quality. Keep in mind what the other reviewer wrote - you need to buy the adapter if it is not the AD model."
4,not included,"We bought the psr280 at another store. They didn't mention that we needed an adaptor. They did however tell us about the headphones we wanted, and then sold us the wrong set."
1,Only an idiot would buy this game,"Totally horrible game design, play, and graphics. What does this all add up to? An absolutly, totally horrible and terrible game. Do not buy this game at risk of your sanity. You have been warned. (Please, if you must, at least rent it first)"
2,This game should have been great.,"I admit I did put hours into this game being the hugh Mortal Kombat fan that I am. Gosh I'm sure happy this embarrassing MK game didn't ruin Subzero's career. It is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks (oh, and they're all twins for some reason)..Subzero has many power-ups that prove useless. The mega-sized bosses are boring to fight (oh, and they never die for some reason). Due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps (how generic) a strategy guide would be a must, that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place. Two good things did come about from this MK disaster.. Quan Chi & Shinnok. For Mortal Kombat that is a must see ""MK4"" or the new ""MK Deadly Alliance"". Leave this one in the past where it never should have spawned. 2 1/2 stars is as high as I could go. I'm generous."
1,worst MK ever,"If I could give this game less than one star I would. I got this game off a friend for five bucks. That was the worst five bucks I ever spent. This game is terrible. It is soooooo repeditive, and the story is unbearable when they are in the brutally stupid slide show fashion. The soud is terrible because it souds the same to hit a person as it does to hit a wall. Please don't get this game."
1,Sub Zero's worst role ever (LOGO) SMK,"How could Ed Boon do this to my favorite MK character Sub Zero. What a discrace to the MK series.Sucky graphics,sucky moves, and is very complicated.Trust me don't even try this game ever.If you would like to see more of my reviews look for my logo which is SMK at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO)SMK"
1,Very weak supports,"This rack has very weak support. It's great if you only use it to dry socks and boxers, but anything big it wouldn't support. I put 2 pants, 2 jeans and 2 sweaters, and the legs cracks and the whole rack fell apart.."
4,Plenty of Room,"I bought this Polder drying rack to replace an older-style model (longer, with wooden rungs and aluminum side-tubing). My old model had 42 feet of drying space; the Polder has 48 FEET (more than the description indicates). The Polder takes a little getting used to: this dryer is somewhat heavier (all metal), the rungs are shorter and more densely stacked, it's taller, and the stability improves with the balanced distribution of clothing, and the use of the [included] mesh top. The mesh top is useful for small or delicate items.Overall, I'd say it is an improvement - more drying space, smaller footprint, reasonable price - and it fits in my narrow NYC tub when I do handwashing!)Amazon had a good price, free shipping, and shipped much more quickly than promised."
5,Perfect- Holds Much More Than Expected,"This is a great product. Sturdy, space-efficient and well designed. It holds two to three loads of laundry, handles the weight of wet clothes with ease and folds to a reasonably sized rectangle for storage."
3,Awkward..,"This drying is good mostly for small items, (i.e. tops, underwear, socks..) and not for large items (i.e. sheets, coats.. ) Also towards the bottom you can only hang small things like socks / underwear. If that doesn't bother you, this drying rack is better than most of the others that are out there."
3,Had to return due to damage but refund procedure is impressive,"Liked this item but it had some damaged rods and even had some rust on it (as if it had been sitting in stock too long). However, the ease of returning it and getting a refund from Amazon was impressive.Honestly, I did reorder the same exact item because it is something we could use but this time ordered directly from Polder.Since this last transaction with Amazon I have since ordered something completely different and there was no issue with that. Therefore, at this point I plan to continue to be a customer of Amazon."
1,tough to read,The author (translator?) ignores the standard use of quotation marks. This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book. So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book.
1,Dreadful,"After reading The year of the death of Ricardo Reis a book I thought was one of the best ever written and Blindness (not quite the best book ever written) I thought by buying this I was in for a good read...wrong!Jose Saramago continues his bizarre obsession with young women being attracted to decrepid old men (as he does in all his books) The story is thin, uninteresting and leads nowhere and the siege (read massacre) of the Muslims of Lisbon by the 'brave' crusader knights seems to have little to do with the plot apart from add a little sexual sleeze (the gang rape of a Arab woman by crusader knights) and some ill placed Portuguese nationalism."
1,A perfect Bookend,The one line summary says it all. A perefct ornament. Reading it is a different story. Very poorly written or an incredibly poor translation. Can you imagine writing like this? Hooray to the run on sentences! Grade F
4,difficult but rewarding,"saramago's odd use of punctuation, especially for dialog, is indeed difficult to get used to. he forces us to think differently about how words fit and form, and the power of alteration.at the core is the sweet, furtive love story of a quiet middle-aged proof reader and his immediate superior, who has been assigned to oversee his work and prevent further alterations of history. beautifully erotic in places, this work is for the patient reader and may take some time to read and re-read."
4,Great,Fantastic game but the controles are preset and can not be reconfigured.I am used to configuring the controles a certain way and could not get used to this setup.I guess it is like the old saying ( You can't teach an old dog new tricks )I am a gamer and this is the first time I have seen this.Hope this is not the way of the future in games.But SIERRA comes up with a lot of weird stuff.
5,I Love This Game!,"This is one of those good titles you probably never knew existed. Yes, the graphics are dated but there's something about Tony Montana and running coke that makes this game fun. This game is quite challenging even to the most able of gamers. It has over 20 hours of single player time (doing everything) but no multiplayer. It is has a lot of similarities to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (similar graphics, both placed in Miami in the 80's, both involve a really big mansion, and both have good music). As for the story, it takes place after the events in the movie. You are basically trying to regain control of your previous empire.It's a fun game and is at least worth trying."
4,A near all time favorite,"I have to recommend the PS2 version of this game, the PC game is a console port job. The PS2 version plays fine and the PC version can be hardware finicky( To make it run on a fully modern windows 7 x64 system)PC go into deep settings and set the computer to run on 1 CPU core, 1 GPU, then it might run or it might crash, just be sure to restore your computer to normal operation when done.The overall game score loses 1 star for being specifically homophobic in a portion of the game. Hey this is Tony Montana, in an almost entirely non politically correct zone. The worst he'll do to women in this game is carjack them.This is a classic in my library."
1,Vivendi Screws Up Another Franchise,"The only thing that worked properly in this game was the installation. There was obviously no QA or beta testing for this version. The mouse controls are so out of whack I couldn't even get past the tutorial let alone the first level. Call me cynical, but I think this was done on purpose to get people the buy the console versions. It's really sad because I really wanted to play this game due to the ""what if"" storyline. First Leisure Suit Larry now this. Burn in hell VUG!!"
3,Fun but hard on little knees and hands,My little one has enjoyed this since his first birthday. The only downfall is that the wires aren't as padded as I had hoped. He has had bruised knees and sore hands from the pressure of crawling over the wires. I have tried putting a blanket inside to cushion but it seems to always get bunched up in one small area. I would love to see it come out in a version with more padding.
4,Good Dog Toy,"I got this for my dog because it is a little bit bigger and longer than most tunnels. Wouldn't be good for any large dogs, but good for any dog 20 inches or smaller. It packs up nice and neat to be put away."
1,disappointed,There is nothing fluffy about this product but the box appears to have a picture on the top that seems to advertise that way. These are hard candy lollipops! I had wanted cotton candy fluffy lollipops. They also arrived with about 12 broken or cracked of the 48 in the box and likely came that way from the manufacturer. Fortunately I only needed 33 for a classroom .. but I would never order these again.
5,You won't be able to put it down . . .,"It's been a long, long time since I read a book which tugged my emotions in so many different directions: joy, anger, relief, sadness, and on and on . . . right up until the last page! The author really knows how to make his characters come alive. I found myself thinking about these people as though they were close friends and being terribly concerned about their life choices. The book is timely in its depiction of the need for Christian-Muslim dialogue and understanding and of our tendencies to use religion to create barriers instead of bridges. So powerful!"
5,Finally found a great tent!,"This is our 4th tent and we finally found a great one! It is much more durable than the disney character ones which my girls seem to break within the first few days. It is roomy -- my 3 and 4 year olds slept in it one night with pillows et al, has a place to attach a play tunnel and so far, we've only cracked one of the poles instead of breaking it."
4,Good buy,My 3 year old enjoys playing in this tent. It was easy to assemble. Took two of us less than 10 minutes.There was a minor thing though. Once my 3 year old's hair got tangled in the zipper while trying to enter the tent. Luckily we were able to untangle it without any harm done. Now she bows down real well before entering the tent.Other than that...it has been fun.
4,"Super talent, over-produced, again!","Harlemm Lee has amazing musical abilities and the one I think should qualify him as a star is his vocal arrangements; but alas, the music making machine has over-produced his tracks and condensed them into the uniform sound that musicland loves so much. If left to his own devices, Harlemm Lee could be a huge star. I'll keep buying any albums he puts out in the hope that one day his label will give him more input on the finished product."
4,JOHNNY WRIGHT JIPPED HARLEMM !!,"man, harlemm lee has a plethora talent but you can definitely tell that wire records was NOT into showcasing harlemm to his full. the songs could have been recorded in a more catchy fashion and the songs chosen were pretty bad. THIS BOY HAS SOO MUCH TALENT; we've all seen it on FAME , but the recording label SUCKS and this CD is an okay buy. His talent still shines through, but I think he could do so much better on his own without that ... Johnny WRIGHT!!"
3,Who Markets Harlemm? Off with their heads...,"From the first time I saw him on FAME, I could not BELIEVE how poorly marketed Harlemm has been. AWESOME talent and presence. FAME did well in choice of a ""triple threat"", although there is nothing ""threatening"" about him. Doesn't need it. He's got my vote :o)"
2,Johnny Wright Is SO Wrong!,"The CD I feel, for Johnny Wright, is just an obligation filled to FAME. In NO WAY does this CD reflect the enormous talent of Harlemm. I know, I've done shows with Harlemm and see him bring the house down night after night. Even the music tracks seem cheap, the production is sub par. Harlemm you deserve better! I hope Clive Davis see's the potential and talent that far exceeds Clay Aiken and takes you to the level of artistry I and all your fans know your capable of. Best of luck and I hope on your next CD you get a company and a manger that has a clue."
4,Introducing Harlemm Lee,"this album consists of a lot of covers and a few original songs..it's unusual for an album to have a lot of covers but Harlemm pulls it off very well..the arrangements for the songs are very good..it really highlights Harlemm's unique voice..it accentuates his good vocal control and range..out of all the covers ""Lean On Him"" to me stood out because it had a gospel-like feel to it with the choir in the background..from the originals, i like ""Let's Get Serious"" because of the dance vibe to it..but the ballads showcase Harlemm's beautiful voice..i hope this cd will introduce Harlemm Lee to mainstream America and have him rediscovered by fans that love him way before Harlemm Lee..the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because i would have loved more originals..but it's still a good cd to have..go get it!!!"
1,inferior product,"i've used waterbased topcoats in the past with no problem. this product claimed it could be used over latex paint. when i topcoated a dry coat of benjamin moore semi gloss latex paint, the product curdled and became tacky almost instantly making it impossible to apply with a brush. i had to remove the topcoat from the project. i will not use this product again."
3,THE BEST TOY EVER!!,"We have this in our baby's crib and also the Tiny Love Symphony in Motion mobile. I think that my daughter doesn't love this as much as many other babies do because the mobile is so great it eclipses everything else! Once she's too big for the mobile and we take it out of the crib, I'm hoping the Ocean Wonders will wow my girl! I love it and think it's cool and I really want her to love it too! (I only gave it three stars because she's not crazy about it right now, if it was for me I'd give it five stars! :-) ) UPDATE - APRIL 2006- We've just converted the crib to a toddler bed (our daughter's 2 years old) and this is one of 2 toys that are STILL THE BEST TOYS EVER!!! She LOVES her fishies now more than ever....WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Thump!,"I didn't buy this or register for it but was given this item from my younger sister who was giving away her baby items. It seemed like an ideal thing to have in the crib to keep the baby entertained. The music is a little annoying but the baby loved it, which was more important. It was soothing to him and he loved the bubbles and the fish going up and down. The only problem I have with this item is that my baby would bang his head against it while he was rolling over in the crib. I would hear a ""thump"" during his nap time. My sister had the same problem. It's great while the baby is awake to enjoy it, but remove it once the baby falls asleep. Especially if the baby can roll over on his/her own (6 mos or so). Perhaps Fisher-Price should look into adding some padding around it? Otherwise, a nice product."
4,Great toy if you like buying batteries,"My son loves this toy, however the only complaint I have is that it eats batteries. Faster than his swing, and faster then his other toys, He loves it though so I keep replacing them. I should probably get some rechargable ones but cant seem to find them in size D."
3,not noisy but doesn't fit with my bumper pad,"Again with the people complaining about motor noise......mine was quiet enough to hear the music on the softest level and it is extremely entertaining (to me, anyway! my baby isn't here yet) but I had to return it because even when my mattress is on the lowest level, there is no room between the bumper and the rails (at the top) to fit! I guess I'm NOT biased, since I have never even heard of the Peaceful Planet aquarium or whatever, but this is a great, cute, inventive toy and I'm sure my child would have loved it!"
4,Ocean Wonders Aquarium,This is a great addition to any crib. My 6 week old daughter loves it and just sits and watches the fish swim around before she falls asleep. My only problem with it is that the music doesn't play long enough and she's too young to push the button herself so I find that I'm going back in a few times to have the music play again.
5,I don't have to rock my son to sleep anymore!!,"This toy is perfect for a high-needs baby who needs comforting to get to sleep at night. I LOVE this toy! My son loves the nice soft lights and music. He ALWAYS had to be rocked by my husband or I to get to sleep (He's 4 months old). And now he looks at the lights and is calmed into sleeping, I do sneek into his room to turn it on again but it only takes a couple of times to get him off to sleep. I WISH this toy came with a remote control, so I would not have to sneek beside the crib and quickly push the blue button without him seeing me."
5,It does work,We purchased this new version for my baby girl Isabel when she was 1 month ..At first I was dissapointed because Isabel payed no attention to it..but by the time she was 3 months It worked..I turn it on she turns her head to watch the fish grabs her blankie and within a couple of minutes she is calm...sometimes I have to sneak in and press it again but never more than twice.
2,Not as good as the first FP aquarium!,"We bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium for our second child, because our first born still used his Peaceful Planet Aquarium to sleep at night. The original Peaceful Planet Aquarium is much nicer! The Ocean Wonders plays &quot;yanni style&quot; music and the bubbles/moving fish are so noisy that you can barely hear the music. I wish they still made the Peaceful Planet Aquarium!"
4,Good product for the money.,"I put my son to sleep for his naps with this music playing. He is just getting old enough to use it for its full potential. I do recommend it if not just for the different sounds. It is a little bit harder to install on cribs that are not the ""norm"". I have a sleigh bed crib and it had to be put on the end versus the side."
4,Ocean Aquarium,"I bought this b/c my niece & nephew loved theirs (older version). I am very happy with ours, my daughter likes it, especially at night with the lights, and the different songs soothe her to sleep. I rarely use the bubbles/swimming fish because the motor is loud & it does not stay on very long. Other than that, I play the music at every nap time."
1,This version is horrible!!!!,"I cannot believe so many people actually like this version!!! The music is more suited to a funeral, then to soothing a baby!!!! The motor is so loud, I can hear it in my bedroom!!! Even my 19 year old son said, that it was terrible compared to the first aquarium!!! My 18 month old son doesn't find it nearly as interesting as the old one. Sometimes it pays to NOT improve a product!!!!!"
2,big dissapointment,"this product is not available at the store and must be purchased online so you pay extra for shipping and don't get to inspect before you buy. Apparently Fisher Price doesn't know that Bumpers on an infant crip don't leave room for the verticle straps this product requires. I was able to return the toy to the store but I was still out the cost of shipping. I suppose I could have waited until my baby was old enough to lover the mattress, but she's got sleeping issues now."
2,Ok - But too Loud...,I went out a specifically bought this for may daughter because I didn't get it as a shower gift. We have fish tanks in the house and I thought it would be fun for her to have her 'own'. But the bubble are so loud that I only use the music part of it. A bit disappointing because I though the bubble would be the best part! But the music is nice. The natural sounds are so soothing. Luckily there are options to turn the bubbles off.
3,Be Prepared To Buy Lots Of Batteries!,"I am the mother of a 9 month old baby. I bought the ocean wonders aquarium about 3 months ago.The Ocean Wonders Aquarium has 3 settings. The first one with only music, the second one with music and lights, and the third one with music, lights, bubbles and fish movement.The toy could have been a great toy, if the batteries didn't die out every other day. You have to have some super mega ultra batteries to keep it on setting 3 (lights,music, bubbles, etc.). The batteries don't actually die, the toy will just not let you keep it on setting 3.I figured I would get my moneys worth and keep it on setting 2 in her crib. She seems to like it a lot. It is the last thing I hear at night and the first thing I hear in the morning."
2,So cute,"We love this toy, it has been in my son's crib since he is a few weeks, and at almost 2 he still loves it. Cute, entertaining, and interactive. I think it is a must have."
4,Soothes so well!,"We've had this in our 4 month old son's crib since he was born, and it's a great way to get him mentally ready for a nap or a night's sleep. Volume control could go a bit lower, though."
3,what happened to the original aquarium?????,THE ONE THAT CAME OUT BEFORE THIS ONE WAS MUCH BETTER. IT HAD A WINDOW AT THE TOP SO THE WAVES OF THE WATER AND LIGHT REFLECTED ON THE CEILING. THAT WAS GREAT. THIS MODEL IS NOT THAT GREAT. MY SON LIKED IT BUT NOW THE BUBBLES DO NOT WORK. I HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR 3 MONTHS SO NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO CALL FISHER PRICE TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO ABOUT THIS. I DID NOT PAY $29.99 FOR IT TO ONLY WORK FOR 3 MONTHS! I AM DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS AND VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS ONE DOES NOT DO WHAT THE ORIGINAL DID. WHAT A WASTE! IF THERE WAS A ZERO FOR DURABLITY I WOULD GIVE IT THAT!
2,Not my son's favorite,"My friends recommended this product, but we had a bad experience with it. First of all, the bubble setting makes a rather loud noise and my son had trouble falling asleep. Second, and the most painful, once my son learned to roll over and scoot around, he kept hitting the bottom of the toy with his head and needless to say was getting really upset about it. We kept it in his crib for about 3 weeks and now it's stored in the closet. It was not the best investment for us."
5,Must have!,"A friend of ours gave this to us for our baby shower and we're so glad that they did. Our daughter who is 7 months old loves this toy (it's been in her crib since she was a month old). It has helped calm her when she was fussy and also helped her go to sleep. As soon as we press the button and the sound of the ocean is playing, she always focuses her attention to the toy. We definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a crib toy for their baby. It's a must have!"
4,Poorly made,"We received this as a gift and I'm very disappointed with the quality of the product. It would be a great item IF IT WORKED! We've replaced ours twice and neither of them worked!...What should be a great item isn't, all because ours won't work. It will work if its held a certain way, almost as if there was some kind of short in it. Very disappointing."
4,Great changing table toy,"I first put this in the crib, only to find my daughter not able to touch it. The straps only worked on the sides of my crib for a good fit. So I decided to attach it to the changing table. This worked out great! I am able to keep my daughter entertained with the bubbles and fish moving around while I change her. I even used it for the night changes and adjusted the sound so it wouldn't wake my husband. She is 6months old now and loves to touch the ball to make the clam open his mouth."
4,Good product,I bought this after losing the newer ocean wonders with the large fish in the middle. I loved it but this older one was cheaper. Works great and I like the volume knob vs the 3 preset volume levels on the newer one. That way you can set the exact volume with the rotary knob.
2,Fun but expensive to keep running.,"The aquarium is great to look at and listen too, but I have found that I am constantly having to replace the batteries. My daughter isn't even in her crib that often and yet the few times I use the aquarium, I am always replacing the batteries. It seems like so many baby items require batteries now, what happened to wind up items? It is lots of fun, but I find it somewhat inconvenient to keep it in working order. They should have had a wind up version maybe with a solar powered light."
2,Don't buy it!,We were intially looking for something like the peaceful planet fish tank we had with our oldest. Couldn't find it so we got this thinking it would be as soothing. The motor is too loud to hear the music if you choose to have the lights and movement on. The lights don't give out enough light to show the fish moving and the fish don't move the way you would think.
3,Wakes my daughter up at night,"My mother-in-law bought this as a surprise for our daughter, we were very excited about it at first. However, my daughter moves around a lot in her sleep and there have been several times she has rolled over and kicked it thereby turning it on and it woke her up. She does love looking at it during the day, however I am not sure I would use it at night. Also I am unsure as to why they call this toy educational"
5,My son loves it,"Great! The only down side is it really uses the batterie. We purchased a battery charger for the baby ""equipment"". Well worth it."
4,Love It!,"I read reviews that said that this was loud but wanted to try something to get my daughter to sleep in her crib. She will not only fall asleep in her crib at night but if she wakes up, I turn this on and she goes right back to sleep.It is a bit loud but only adds to the distraction for her. Even with my other two children running & screaming, she was able to fall asleep with this.The only thing I don't like is that it only lasts 5 minutes and turns off. I thought that I read somewhere that motion turns it on but unfortunately it doesn't. The five minutes isn't too bad since she usually falls asleep quick.Overall, I will buy this for baby presents from now on. I never had anything like this in the crib with my other two children and I wish that I did. I think they would have learned to sleep better."
5,Son loves it,I bought this for my 4month old son to keep with his aquarium theme and he loves it. He will stay in his crib and play with it for a while before falling asleep. He loves to turn it on and off.
5,Best Crib Toy on the Market,"Our son loves this thing. He has woken in the night and turned it on all by himself, and then goes right back to sleep. It is amazing. It's nice and dim, so you can use it to lull them to sleep at night. My son is 7 months old and we've had this in his crib since he was 3 months. The older he gets, the more he likes it."
4,A MUST have crib accessory,I bought this for my nephews crib while he's with me during daycare....he's used it since he was 6wks old....some of the songs drive me nuts...and i've gone through about 3 sets of batteries (he's 13 months now) and i need another set now...but he loves it...i'll set it to bubbles and it helps him go to sleep...when he wakes up...he plays with it and i always know when he's up so i can wrap up whatever i'm doing cause i'll hear it start up....THIS is a definate must....I don't know what'd we'd do without it...
3,Neat but baby would rather play,"This is really neat. I like how the fish ""swim"" in the water and I like the bubbles only setting. I don't care for the tunes that much. One of the tunes drives me nuts. My daughter will NOT go to sleep with it. She will play with it though when she wakes up. If I turn it on when she's sleepy she will sit right up and play with it instead of sleeping. She's currently 8 months old and I purchased it when she was 4 months."
3,Not as good as previous model,"I wholeheartedly agree with 4xblessed's review. She said it all. We had the previous model, it was wonderful and my son also used it until it wore out (when he was 3 and in his big boy bed). His little sisters have this new version and it's noisy and I miss the waves that used to be cast upon the ceiling)"
5,great gift!!,"We started using this when our baby turned 3 months old, the same time when we moved him out of our bed and into his own crib. The comforting music helps block out other outside noises and has always helped soothe our baby to continuously sleep. Now our son is almost 5 months old and he's started to learn to kick the music on and off himself and he still loves it!! This is a great product!"
4,Works Great/Great Features... but...,"the part that soothes my 3 month old daughter the most (the bubbles, lights and music) only lasts for 5 minutes then shuts itself off. If I use this great product, I have to stay in the room until our daughter is completely out and keep turning it back on, this usually is about 20-30 minutes. We really like this and so does she, just wish the default shut off time could be adjusted to our preferences not a 5 minute automatic shut off. I'd also like the music selection I choose to stay in the ""memory"" so that when we turn it on, we don't have to fiddle with finding the ""right music"" every time.By the way, I know that the music and lights part lasts for 10 minutes before it shuts itself off. It's soothing to our little girl too but not as much as the option with the bubbles.This is a really good product just needs a little tweaking by the manufacturer...."
1,Disappointed,I was so excited to receive this for my shower but was extremely disappointed when I could not use it because it did not mount to the sleigh bed style crib we have for our daughter.
1,Hated the bouncer,We had the Fisher Price Kick and Play bouncer and thought we would try the Aquarium. Big mistake. First the bouncer was so high up we thought he might fall. Also the Aquarium was so large and did not fit properly in the bouncer we were scared it would fall and hurt our child. We returned it immediately.
1,"boring and stupid, get a mobile","this toy is another attempt by toymakers to teach infants to be content alone in their cribs. anyone who still buys into the idea that babies will and should fall asleep alone should get a full grown dog, not have a baby. this toy is so pathetic that it can only grasp for the attention of a very young babies, my four month old was bored with it immediately. do yourself and your baby a favor. rock, nurse and sing your baby to sleep yourself. if you want a crib toy get your baby a mobile or 2. they are much more interesting for the baby."
3,Not very useful,"I bought this toy hoping it would help my son to fall asleep. I wish it was this easy! The aquarium is actually more stimulating than calming to him. As an infant toy, it is not really interesting for very young babies: the details of the sea life are too tiny and colors are not contrasting enough for babies under 2.5 - 3 months old when their vision finally develops to be more like ours.I wish I could turn the music off and use the thing as a nightlite, but you can't turn it off completely.Soon my son will learn how to turn on the aquarium and play with the shellfish and the starfish. I will keep the toy for him to enjoy at an older age. Yet, there are other, more educational toys for the money."
4,He loves to play with it - but doesn't help him to sleep!,"My 8 month old loves to play with this - but it's not particularly soothing to him! He plays with it in the morning so it buys us a few minutes of time, but I can't say I find it very soothing myself. It is loud (the motor) and you really have to turn the music up to cover the sound of the motor - and the lullabies are a bit tinny - I know what people mean now. It's really, really cute - and he likes to play with it - but as for putting him to sleep or at least making him drowsy - hasn't worked yet and we've had it a few weeks. Maybe you need to start them on it earlier?"
3,not impressed,I bought this a couple of months ago for my 4mo old. My friend reccomended it (she had the original one with the oval fish bowl face)her baby totally loves hers. My baby really hasn't paid much attention to it. She is more intrigued with her mobile. I think it is way too heavy and worry about it falling onto her. So far I'm not impressed especially for the price!
4,this is a good toy,"ok, baby not here yet but this wonderful little machine is now in my 5 year olds room, he is autistic with adhd and has become obsessed with this product, i havent had to fight as much at bed time and at night when he wakes from night mares he has used it to put himself back to sleep, wich is wonderful since i am only days away from due date and have my own trouble catching sleep,i am purchasing a 2nd one for the baby so i dont have to remove it from my older sons possetion"
3,Good for little babies ONLY,"I got this as a gift for my 5 month old daughter and she liked it enough. However, it is only good if your child is very young. My daughter would sit up or from napping etc. and hit her head on it all the time or used it to pull up. It is very very heavy so make sure it is secure at all times. I can't imagine if this thing fell on your child."
2,No Bubbles,"I put the ocean wonder aquarium on my registry and received it at my shower because I had gotten another ocean wonders toy and liked the theme. I put the aquarium on my daughters crib and everything was fine for a few hours until the bubbles stopped. Now for a 1 month old that was her favorite part. I tried replacing the batteries and still after a couple of hours no more bubbles. It would make the sound for the bubbles to come out but no bubbles. I find it very noisy and it was very disapointing that the bubbles would not work. My daughter still likes the aquarium and we use it every night with the music and lights. If I would have known that it was going to work like this I would have returned it for another crib toy, or not have put it on my regristy at all."
4,leaked!!!!!!,This toy leaked its toxic juice all over my son's crib. My son and I enjoyed this product until it became a health hazard.
3,Re: Broken Lights Twice,"This is in response to the review questioning whether the lights on this product were broken. When I turned on the Aquarium we purchased, the light(s) on our unit was only one color even though the box referred to different colored lights. I checked with Fisher Price and the representative I spoke with indicated that there was a mis-print on the box. The wording on the box should only have referred to soft lights and to soft colored lights. There should not have been any reference to colored. I've only given this product 3 stars since we just purchased it and have not had a chance to completely test it out. Hope this helps."
1,Doesn't hold a candle to Peaceful Planet aquarium,"If your baby or child is used to the Peaceful Planet (PP)aquarium, the Ocean Wonders (OW) aquarium is a poor follow-up product. We had to find this out the hard way, as we forgot our PP aquarium on a week-long visit with Grandma. I quickly went out and bought an OW aquarium, and it was a FLOP with my son. The PP aquarium soothed my son to sleep for both naps and bed time, while the OW aquarium seemed to gear up my son. While the PP aquarium has soothing sounds, music, and ceiling lights, the OW strikes out on all three. And why the clam and starfish toys??? Fisher-Price ought to know that the aquarium is really a parents' tool for helping a little one drift off into la-la land, not a tool for play... Wonder if Fisher-Price consulted any parents in their product development and research... Maybe FP will bring back the Peaceful Planet aquarium."
2,Just not as good as the Peaceful Planet Aquarium,"After our P.P.A. died, I ran out to get this one to replace it. I was immediately struck by the fact that the ""fit and finish"" were not as good. This one feels cheaper. The fish are not as nice --and horror of all horrors, instead of soothing my 15 month old son to sleep as the old one had done this one stimulates him. It is so loud, it sounds like there is a locomotive coming through his crib, the bubble sound isn't as good (though the music quality is much better), and the lights are not adjustable like the P.P.A.I am preggo with my second child and will now search ebay and any other site to find a new P.P.A. for my baby. I gave this new one to a friend. I just had no use for it. The Peaceful Planet Aquarium was just a much better quality machine. In my mind this new one as cheaply made as a Yugo. I miss the Mercedes-like quality of the other."
3,Soothing but too loud,"We bought this in an attempt to help my 8-month old son sleep better, and it has helped. After having it a few months, I can tell my son calms down for sleep when I turn it on.There is a variety of settings and sounds, which is nice, and the music and water sounds are very soothing. However, it doesn't stay on long enough. He's often still awake after the 5-10 minute cycle. There is a volume dial, but it doesn't go down to a ""zero"" setting, so even the quietest setting seems loud in the middle of the night. Also, I was hoping to use the bubbles, but because the ""chug-chug"" sound of the motor drowns them out, we never use that setting. That was the most disappointing feature."
4,great toy for helping child wind down,"Whether your child is winding down to go to sleep or just grabbing some quiet time in the afternoon, this is very nice. There are 7 music choices (3 song, 3 water, 1 random) and choices of having all bubbles/fish/lights w/music, just lights and music, or just music (I think I've got those combos right). The bubbles/fish/lights setting does have the additional noise of the motor making the fish go around and the bubbles go, but it is fairly quiet in my opinion and you can choose no bubbles/fish for a more restful setting. The lights only setting with the ocean waves is very relaxing for my 1 year old son.Very pleased with this toy (and did not expect to necessarily be so based on quite a few of the reviews talking of noise)."
3,Great Toy for Hard to sleep Babies,"My two month old was having a hard time getting adjusted to his crib, so I bought this for his crib to serve as a night light for him. The first night he was fast asleep within 5 minutes. He enjoys the natural sounds more than the music. The only thing I would change is making the natural sounds last longer...they only play for 5 minutes, so if it stops and he's not asleep yet, he will start to cry."
3,Not very entertaining,"I thought the Ocean Wonders Aqaurium would be entertaining for my 6 month old daughter. She loves to look at the live fish tanks that her daycare provider has so I thought this would be a great buy. It did not interest her and she just ended up kicking off the crib onto the floor. Also, the toy consumes much battery power and needs new batteries at least once a month.My daughter found it to be ""not very entertainig"" at all."
4,loads of fun,My daughter loves this aquarium. It has neat lights and loads of fun music. It soothes her back to sleep and she loves to watch the water and listen to the bubbles.
2,My daughter is too young?,"I loved this toy - but my daughter (4 months old) doesn't. She is not very interested in it, and cries at the sound of many of the songs. Maybe when she is older she will like it more? I liked the visuals and the bubbles, but it does not hold or attract her attention at this age!"
5,my baby loves this,I turn this on for my baby every night when I put her down and she watches it intently. It has 3 options for sounds and music and you can have it turn off automatically. Baby can even turn it on if you leave it on that mode. It is nice for them to watch in the dark. Love it
3,Not necessary but grows into it...,"My son has just started noticing this toy at six months, even though he has had it since day 1. He is now able to roll into it and turn it on. I often turn it on as he falls asleep for noise/distraction, and I like that it shuts itself off after about 5 minutes."
5,Life and sleep saver!,Our 3 month old loves this toy. She actually started turnng her head towards it at two weeks. We put her in bed awake and turn it on and she falls alseep! I have had two friends say their two year olds still play with it- one has it mounted on her toddler bed! I think that speaks volumes about the toy!The only way this toy would be better is if you could keep it on longer (Ok sometime we have to hit hte button 2x to get her to fall asleep) other htan that I recommend anything oceany to my friends. We have the boucey seat that matches and she love it too!
3,Broke in 3 months,"I don't know if anyone had this problem, but we got Ocean Wonders Aquarium as a gift from our registry and three months into using this mobile it broke. At first we thought it was a battery, but after changing them the toy is still not working right. There is a horrible mechanical sound that is coming from within the toy, and the music comes out slow, and strung out. I'm hoping that play-school will replace it since we've barely used it.All my friends swore by this mobil, but to be honest, I've seen much better once on the market. The Aquarium only plays for maybe 10 minutes on the longest setting, and it only has 2 song options, with other options being white noise (ocean sound, etc.). I think there is much better products out there than this one."
1,WAY TOO NOISY!! DRIVING ME CRAZY!!,My son loves to watch the fish and bubbles but when the bubbles are on it is so noisy. There is a knocking noise in the background. He sleeps in my room and I cannot stand it so we are replacing it with another toy ASAP. I would expect more from Fisher Price.
1,has no water after being in the closet for 2 years.,My 3 year old son played with this all the time till he got to be a year old then i put it in the closet for a while till i had my 2nd son and just toke it out and now it has no water inside and the fish dont move either. Is there some where i can take it to get a replacement?
2,NOISEY!,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THAT SOMEONE HAD BOUGHT THE OCEAN WONDERS AQUARIUM FROM MY REGISTRY, LITTLE DID I KNOW HOW MUCH NOISE IT COULD MAKE. THE MUSIC WAS FINE, BUT WHEN THE FISH MOVE AROUND YOU CAN HEAR THE MOTOR. I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE AS LOUD AS IT WAS. I RETURNED IT EVEN BEFORE MY BABY WAS BORN. I JUST COULD NOT SEE ANYWAY THAT IT COULD SOOTHE MY BABY."
4,OK but.... How Do I Extend the Timer??,"Great toy.. Calms our little girl down before bed. Great White noise for young babies. Only have a young baby, so not sure only value of it as she approaches 6+ months. I wish it stayed on for more than 3 pr 4 minutes though.. Anyway to override this? Our baby is lulled and then will jump at the noise because I need to turn it back on."
3,better for tiny babies?,"bought this at around 4 month for my son after receiving numerous glowing reports. I figured anything that might help his colic and fighting-sleep spasms couldn't hurt to try. it's cute, he likes to look at it, and it soothes ME, but doesn't do a thing to calm him. he rolls around his crib all night long so i can't keep it in there b/c he accidently knocks it on and wakes up (NOT what you want with a fussy baby!). Also, the on/off switch is so big that when he gets excited and wants to play with it, he ends up turning it off and on off and on, gets frustrated by that and loses interest. So, maybe newborns who can't really play with it but can look and listen would love it."
5,great toy for baby,"we recieved this toy as a christmas gift for our son who was 3 months old at the time. he loves this toy! i have many pictures of him just laying on the floor or in his crib watching this toy. my husband and i also love this toy because, when our son wakes up in the night he can activate it himself and it helps him to go back to sleep on his own. like someone else said though the bubble motor is a little loud but i think it just adds to the claming affect of the toy. the motor noise is not a bad noise like some other toys motors i have heard. i think this was the best gift we have received for our son yet."
3,YES ITS CUTE BUT MAKES A LOUD TICKING NOISE,I WAS VERY UPSET WITH THIS ONE COMPAIRED TO THE PP.I HAVE BOTH OF THEM AND LIKE THE PP .YES ITS CUTE AND TOP OF THE LINE ..(SOME PEOPLE JUST BUY THINGS TO BE BETTER THAN THE JONES'S I THINK).ITS OK BUT THE MOTOR MAKES A LOUD NOISE.SO I HAVE TO TURN THE MUSIC UP LOUDER SO IT CAN BE HEARD OVER THE LOUD TICKING NOISE.SOMETIMES CUTE IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST.BUT HEY WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU ....
4,Mezmorizing,"My 6 month old daughter really likes this toy! whenever she gets fussy, all I have to do is turn it on and she is mezmorized. I don't use it in her crib. It sits on our coffee table. It seems to be a calming toy. She also likes to play with the lever and the ball to make the clam and starfish move. She also likes to push the button to turn it on and off. I like that it has different sound/songs to listen to. when I need to make a phone call, all I need to do is turn that on the quiet ocean sounds and she is content. Overall, it's a calming toy not a busy toy."
5,So far it's wonderful,"My 3 month old baby girl loves watching this toy. It's soothing and pretty and I wish I could climb in there with her and watch it too :)My only complaints are that the volume control is pretty useless because if you try to make it low, the motor is still pretty loud. To drown out the sound the motor makes you have to keep the music pretty loud.Also, the two knobs on there to ""play"" with seem pointless as well. I can hardly see what effect spinning the wheel or pressing the button has, so I am sure my daughter can't see it either.I gave it 2 stars for educational value but in its defense I don't see that this toy is meant to be an educational toy, rather a soothing toy to watch before sleepingI highly recommend this toy."
4,Olivia's Mommy,I received this item as a baby shower gift for my daughter. It sat in the closet for the 1st two months of her life (mostly because I forgot about it) and I regret every minute it was left in the packaging. It's ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! My daughter finally loves her crib! The lights and music help her to fall asleep on her own ... no more nights of crying and fussing because it's bedtime. Thanks Fisher-Price for another fantastic product!
2,Really dissapointed,"I really can't comment on durability because I haven't had it long enough to really judge. We had the Peaceful Planet aquarium but it broke so Fisher Price sent us this on as a replacement. I've found the music is really wierd; the motor that makes the bubbles is loud and drowns out the musi;, it has three buttons on the front: two of them let the baby operate fish inside the aquarium, the third turns the thing off! So baby turns it off then cries because it quit. Also, it doesn't put the waves on the wall, which was something she really liked about PP, and it doesn't sit on the dresser like the PP did. I found a PP on ebay and am going to hope that it doesn't stick like the old one did. Fisher Price should really have just fixed the one problem with the PP. If you didn't have the PP to begin with, you'd probably be happy with the Ocean Wonders. Otherwise, save your money."
3,Maybe I just got a bad one,"This has received a lot of great reviews but I have just been disappointed. The sound volume doesn't work and it only comes out really loud -- not very soothing. Also, when the music does play it sounds really fuzzy and crackelly (is that a word?). If I turn it to the bubble or water noise it doesn't seem to come out fuzzy which is nice. My daughter (5 months) does seem to enjoy it as long as I don't have it set on one of the songs (since that just seems to give headaches). I would have returned the item had it not been a Christmas gift and I threw the box away so it would fit in our luggage better."
4,new mom trying new toys,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FIVE WEEK OLD SON AND SO FAR HE SEEMS TO LIKE IT. THE MUSIC REALLY GETS HIS ATTENTION AND HELPS TO SOOTHE HIM TO SLEEP. THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD CHANGE ABOUT THIS TOY IS SETTING THE TIMERS A LITTLE BIT LONGER. IT TAKES MY SON MORE THAN 5-10 MINUTES TO FALL ASLEEP AND I HAVE TO KEEP RESTARTING IT. OTHER THAN THAT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY DECISION ON PURCHASING IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE
4,Our Baby loves this toy,This works wonders. We play it for her when she goes to sleep and if she wakes up she turns it on herself and falls back to sleep after a short time. This is much better than an over the head mobil.
4,Great product - eats batteries though,My son is 2 and still loves this crib toy. Sometimes at night he'll turn it on to help him back to sleep.I would advise buying rechargable batteries however as I go through 6 D batteries every 2 weeks. The rechargables have been a great investment just for this.
4,"Soothing, but not long enough",Everything is fabulous about the ocean wonders EXCEPT the time it runs. It runs only for about 5 minutes and often it takes my 5 mo old son longer to fall asleep. I wish it had an option to run longer so I don't have to continually return to his nursery to push the restart button.
4,"Love the fish moving around and Music, But its kind of loud","We got this as a gift for our son who is 5 months old now. It keeps his attention and puts him to sleep at nite time. I just wish the motor was alittle less noisy. He seems to like it, but I think people should find someone who has it first and see how loud the motor is. If it doesn't bother you buy it. Its very cute to look at. My son has no problem with it."
4,Very soothing for baby and mommy!,"My daughter just turned 5 moths old and we just starated using the aquarium a few weeks ago. She definitely is intrigued by the lights, the fishies and the music. She is able to turn it on and off by herself. We both get mesmerized by the music. In fact, when she accidently hits it in the middle of the night, and I hear the music on the baby monitor, I get lulled back to sleep. The volume control is great, and I also like how a parent is able to change the songs easily. One big drawback is the loud bubbles. I also wish that it had the light show that the peaceful planet had. But overall, I am glad that we have it."
4,Great!,"My husband and I bought this for our 6 month old daughter because she was having trouble falling asleep alone in her crib. The first night we had it, she didn't cry at all - just looked at the aquarium and listened to the music until she fell asleep. We don't use the bubbles, just the lights and music, which last for 10 minutes. That is usually enough time for her to fall asleep. The big button on the front makes it easy for her to hit and she is able to turn it on herself sometimes. When we went to stay at a friends house overnight, I brought it with us and propped it up next to the playpen that she slept in - it worked like a charm!All in all, I think this is great and is going to be my shower gift to all of my friends who are expecting."
2,Unhappy Customer,I do not recommend this toy for a child of any age. The noise that is supposed to be music is scratchy and unclear. It most certainly is not relaxing.This product is a waste of money.
3,Couldn't use it,This product wouldn't fit on our Ragazzi crib. The plastic straps just wouldn't make it all the way around our top rail. It would have been helpful if the straps were longer or if extender straps were included. We ended up having to return it. :(
1,WHY?,"I bought the OW Aquarium thinking it would be another great product like the PP Aquarium. I was wrong. My son has been falling asleep to the Peaceful Planet Aquarium for two years. Sometimes the PP Aquarium would get stuck, so I bought the Ocean Wonders Aquarium to replace it. I had to return it because my son does not like it one bit. The motor is too loud and the music is strange. I also think the aquarium is too large. My son and I hope Fisher Price comes out with a new aquarium that is similar to the first one."
5,This product saved my sanity!,I would recommend this to anyone! I bought it for my daughter who is a little freaked out by mobiles. I figured it was less intimidating. She's 5 months and can't turn it on with her hand yet - but she has taught herself to turn it on with her feet in the middle of the night and during naps. When she wakes up - she turns it on - watches it for a while - and drifts right back to sleep. It's so quiet that my husband and I never know it's turned on unless we get up for some reason and see a little light shining from her room. I've also heard it come on while she's napping through her monitor - and then it stops and she never makes a peep and goes back to sleep. This is an A+++ product for those of you with a sprited child who wakes up from naps and won't go back to sleep. My daughter LOVES THIS AQUARIUM! Thank you Fisher Price!!!
1,Such a disappointment from the original....,"Our son LOVES his Peaceful Aquarium - so much that we bought a 'backup' in case something happened to one of them. It did, in fact, and Fisher Price sent me a 'replacement' - the new Ocean Wonders Aquarium. My husband and I were extremely disappointed with the newer model. The lights and bubbles are nowhere near as bright or entertaining as the old model - our son just does not like it at all. If you can get your hands on the old one - I highly recommend that one over the new one!"
3,Re: Broken Lights Twice,"In regards to the review about the box indicating there were different colored lights and the product having only one colored light, the light on the Aquarium I purchased was only one color. I called Fisher Price and the representative I spoke with indicated that the packaging had a mis-print. According to Fisher Price, the wording on the box should have said something like ""soft lights"" instead of ""soft-colored lights"". There should not have been any reference to ""colored."" Please note that I only gave this product 3 stars because I just purchased it and have not tested it out completely. So far, it appears to work as advertised. Hope this helps."
1,The straps are too short!!!,"I registered for this Ocean Wonders Aquarium after reading all the reviews for this item. It is very soothing for the baby, but it has some flaws. First of all, the straps are too short for my baby's bed. I and my husband tried to think of a way to fix the problem, but there is no way that we can install it. So, I don't know what to do with it :("
2,who picked the music...???,"we had bought the previous model of this crib toy for our older son, but some of the moving parts had frozen over time in storage, so we decided to replace it since he loved it so much. that version had happy, cheerful nursery songs. the new version plays an almost eerie, creepy, surreal-type music that actually made my youngest son cry! it's a good thing the new model comes with a silent mode (bubble sounds) or we would've returned it.visually, the toy is mesmerizing and my son likes it as long as we don't play the music."
3,Not all that pleased,I am not as happy about this one as I was the first one we purchased in 1999. Its alot different then the other model. I wish they would have kept the other one with a few adjustments.
2,Very Disapointed,I was very disapointed with this mobile. My daughters crib is 1 of the convertible cribs with a bigger head board & we had a really hard time even getting the mobile attached to the crib. The bars in our crib are bigger than the standard & the mobile did not fit well. Even after we got the mobile attached we had to keep playing with the battery box to get the mobile to come on. We ended up returning it for another mobile.
4,Very soothing toy!,"I bought this toy for my 10-month-old son once he started grabbing at his mobile and I had to remove it. It seems to soothe him to sleep very well. He loves the lights and bubbles! The only reason I didn't give this toy 5 stars overall is because the baby can turn the toy off by himself. I wish there was a setting for the parent to be able to control how long the toy is on (in other words, my son turns it off before he's fallen asleep). All in all, I think it's a good toy and worth the money."
3,Needs to play longer!,"I bought this toy for my daughter after everyone told me I ""had to have it"". I thought she was just too young to enjoy it at first, but realized it was never going to get her to sleep because right when she would start to nod off, it would turn off! I would have to sneak back in the room and try to turn it on again and she would see me and fuss all over again. Fisher-Price should consider a remote or have settings to make it play longer. She's also starting to scoot around her crib now and hits her head on it."
2,Just not as good as the PPA,I'm so dissapointed in this new model. When the bubbles are turned on the motor sounds like an running car. It is not at all soothing the way the PPA was with my first son. The music is better but even the fish don't appear to swim as well with this model. It's a shame they didn't perfect the old model. I reccomended it to everyone. Newer is not better in this case. Save your money and hunt down the old model if you can. It's Much Better!
1,piece of JUNK,"The motor in this thing is loud when the bubbles are turned on. In addition, the water leaked, causing the batteries to leak acid. I was horrified to find battery acid on the toy and crib sheet. Imagine what would have happened if my daughter had gotten this on her!"
1,Not for Us - Ocean Wonders,"I purchased one of the Ocean Wonders Aquariums and to me - not to sound morbid - the music sounded like it came from a funeral home. Also, the noisiness of the moving fish was entirely too distracting. Even adjusting the volume button did not reduce the ""racket"" this toy made. I returned my purchase. OH - careful that you don't cut the straps on the back of the cardboard. They appear to be there to snuggly hold the product to the packaging...but these are the straps you utilize to ""attach"" to the baby's crib."
1,Very Disappointed!!!!,"My son is 18 months old, and had the other FP Aquarium, the round one, he loved the music and the fish, and even played with it, so that we could get a little extra sleep! The music on this new one is terrible! It sounds like funeral music! The water feature is so loud, and isn't very soothing. He cries when he plays with it now, if he plays with it at all. Fisher-price should have never messed with the old version, I use to recommend it often. I won't be recommending this one!"
3,A Must Have?,"Everyone told me this was a must have for a new baby. My son doesn't seem to care one way or the other for it. It is a cute toy, and the music sounds soothing, but I don't think this is an absolute must have."
1,totally disappointed!!!,"I bought this toy for my newborn niece after seeing it on commercials and reading others' reviews just to be disappointed! The commercial made it seem like the little fishes were moving and the lights looked really pretty. I decided to test it out before I gave it to her and I am so glad that I did. To my surprise, neither the fishes nor the water moved, the lights were not as nice as I had anticipated, and frankly it was just plain BORING!!! I bought this toy under false pretences and I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,The right sleep toy for my kid,"My 8 month old has been falling asleep to this for 3 months now. I wish there were more tunes and the bubbles are too loud, but other than that it is very soothing to watch and listen. He likes playing with the lever and button roller. They should ditch the bubbles and just make the fish move and add some more songs."
5,Great Crib Item,"Very nice to have for the crib. Nice noises and the music is soothing. There aren't too many different songs though, so you will hear the same one a lot. My daughter likes to roll the ball to open and close the clam. The battery has lasted a long time. Good shower gift too!"
1,Never got to use it...,"Some babies may like it, but ours never got the chance to use it. It doesn't fit her crib. Make sure you check that the top rails of your crib are small enough for the straps to fit around. Also, I think our particular toy may have been defective because the bubbles never worked and it was very loud and bright. Unfortunately, I had thrown away the box and literature before I knew all this or I would've taken it back. I will never do that again."
3,heavy wonders,"My daughter doesn't seem to interested, but we haven't used it very often. It feels a little heavy and I'm a little scared to leave it in the crib."
3,Sometimes it doesn't bubble,"We received this toy at a baby shower. I love the whole Ocean Aquarium line, but this one has a hard time bubbling. I've had to smack it a couple of times to get the bubbles going again and our crib doesn't allow us to hang it at eye level when baby is laying down. The swing they make also has motor trouble and eats batteries, but they have been quick to send a new motor."
4,SLEEPS GREAT!,"My son started using this as soon as we broght him home and he loves it! We have a large ""real"" aquarium he loves to stare at and when its time to go to bed the Ocean Wonders Aquarium does the trick. I do wish it would stay on longer as he doesn't quite get to sleep fast enough (it shuts off after 5, 10 or 15 mins depending on the mode)but i usually wait and push the button again for him. We have had it for 4 months and haven't had to change the batteries yet eithr. A big plus when you have a house full of battery operated toys."
5,Helps Put Baby to Sleep,"With baby toys you throw out ideas and see what sticks. This one does. We received this as a shower gift. We had not registered for it or even seen it before but what a great gift! This crib toy works better than any other for putting the baby to sleep. This is a water filled toy. The mamma and baby fish swim around in circles and there is an air pump inside that generates bubbles and the lights brighten and dim gradually to the beat of the music. It is very hypnotic to look at. I cannot say about the educational value or durability as our baby is only three months old and is not old enough to appreciate the other features with the spinning star fish and clam shell. One interesting thing, this device takes a surprisingly large amount of power. It is probably the air pump. The toy uses four D batteries to operate!"
5,Very cool toy,"My baby really does turn this on to watch the fish move. The sound is great and the colors are very soothing. An excellent choice. It is great on batteries too, since we;ve not had to replace them in 4 months and the toy is used daily."
4,Baby loves this!,Our son is amused by this aquarium! It is on the side of his crib and I turn it on every night before he falls asleep. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 restarts before he falls asleep but it does help! He laughs hysterically at the fish. Great entertainment! Unfortunately it did not start to entertain him until he was 4 months. When he was newborn we tried to hang it on his bassinet and he did not respond to it and the music drove us crazy! All in all it is a great (and inexpensive) way to soothe and occupy our baby!
4,Great Toy,"A friend gave my son this toy when he was born. He really started to check it out at about 5 months. When he would wake up at night and in the morning I could hear him turn it on and off by himself. He's 6 1/2 months now, and plays with it more than ever. The music is really nice and comforting. Definitely a keeper."
2,Not for restless sleepers,"I bought this for my son when he was 2 months old. He loved it. It was just like the ocean wonders swing, which he loved. Now he is 3 1/2 months and I had to take it out of the crib. He turns a lot when he sleeps. Twice his head got stuck under it. He woke up screaming. It think he even bumped his head. I may put it back in the crib when I lower the mattress. But for now I can't use it.If your baby moves a lot when he sleeps, I would not use this. Unless the mattress is lower."
3,its ok for play not for calming,i bought this toy to keep my little girl from fussyness while awake in her crib she is 4 months old and it hangs to high in the crib so she cant see the lights or moving fish but it keeps her perfectly happy if you are holding her up so she can see but all babys are diffrent so all i can say is good luck everything is trial and error hope i was somewhat helpful
5,My son loves this!,"My son is 16 months and he has had this from day one. He has always enjoyed the sounds and lights, but now he enjoys playing with the clam and starfish and changing the settings on it. I often hear him turn it on when he's trying to get to sleep. I think the light and bubbles are great company for him in his crib. He does sometimes like to lift the bottom and bang it down on his crib unfortunately, but other than that I would highly recommend this!"
5,Excellent should be on EVERY baby registry,"Although I didn't get this as a baby shower gift(I didn't even register for one), I think that the Ocean Wonders Aquarium is a must have. I bought this fo my daughter for her first Christmas(she only being a month old at the time). Since then this has calmed her back to sleep too many times to count. I believe there are three of four songs and two types of water sounds, she is easily calmed by the Ocean waves as am I since we share the same room. I had thought about getting one of those white noise/environmental sound machines for her, but I am glad that I decided to buy this instead. For not only is she calmed by the ocean waves, but like to look at the little fish and air bubbles.I definitely recommend putting this on to any baby registry list."
4,Great for Bed Time,My daughter has had hers since she was 4 months old (she's now 15 months) and goes to sleep with it every night. If she wakes up during the night she turns the music on herself and goes back to sleep!Great investment!
5,soothing toy for baby,my son first got the Ocean wonder's Aquarium as a baby shower gift and has been useing it since he was first born he is now 9 month's old and he still loves useing it the soothing music and the soft light help's him sleep not to mention the light show with the fish he now learned how to turn the Ocean wonder's Aquarium on when he want's the light show and the music and off when he had enough The Ocean wonder's has 6 song's soothing that it play's I highly recomend this toy to everyone with a baby
2,dissapointed in ocean wonders aquarium crib toy,"I recieved this for my baby shower. I had a daughter who was born deaf and she LOVED this toy! She loved the bubbles and the fish swimming as well as the lights! She didn't use it until she was three months old (this is how old she was when she came home from the hospital FINALLY!) She loved this thing!!! When she became 5 months old the bubbles stopped working and it leaked out some water and with no bubbles, the fish don't swim. All she has to entertain her are the lights and that really doesn't do the job she needs more action. I was very dissapointed, it was an older model I guess and was not serviceable. I have to throw it away and by something else."
2,An Accident Waiting To Happen,"I purchased this toy for my 4 1/2 month old thinking that the soothing ocean sounds would relax him and help him to fall asleep at night. Athough he seemed to enjoy it, the toy is an accident waiting to happen. I placed it on the crib rail per the instructions and it fell off into his crib sometime during the night while he was sleeping. As far as crib toys go it is on the heavy side and I am lucky it didn't fall on top of him. The straps obviously do not hold well. I do not recommend this toy at all."
2,aquarium 2,"This new Ocean Wonder Aquarium is OK but nowhere as good as the original Peaceful Planet Aquarium. My 1 1/2 yr old still use his Peaceful Planet Aquarium (he LOVES it)so I wanted to buy another one for our new baby and when I saw the bigger Ocean Wonder Aquarium I thought great!!! But even though it has the fish & bubbles like peaceful did, the Ocean Wonder doesn't have the dancing waves on the ceiling and when you turn the music off & the bubbles on the motor has a Very noticeable sound, might not be very peaceful to some babies, where peaceful WAS peaceful. My 4 month old will watch the Wonder fish but doesn't seem as entertain as he is with the Peaceful Planet one."
3,Not as good as the Peaceful Planet aquarium,"My older son had the Peaceful Planet aquarium as a baby, and loved it even as a toddler, but the motor broke so the ""fishies"" didnt go around anymore...Papa fixed it temporarily but soon it was broken for good...my son needed his fishies, so I tried buying a new one, only to find that it had been replaced with a newer model, the Ocean Wonders aquarium...NOT AS GOOD as the first- this one doesnt have the reflection on the ceiling like the 1st, the motor is WAY LOUDER, and I think the music is creepy, to be honest. The Peaceful Planet was simple & did the trick, not sure why they changed it.I was going to buy an aquarium for my new baby but don't think I will if it has to be the Ocean Wonders model..."
2,not impressed,"The only crib toy I really liked and thought was entertaining for my new baby was the Peaceful Planet Aquraium. Unfortunatly I was told that was no longer avalible. but this one was the new model replacing it. first the bubbles only come out of one side, instead of both sides(unless you tip it over). then the sounds don't sound much like waves or water running and actually scares my child and the toys on it for the baby to play with are too small for the baby to find. I hate to write reviews but this product was so dissapointing. Very much a waste of money."
4,The original is better,"I bought the original Aquarium when it first cane out in 2000 and I absolutely loved it. But when I took it out this year for our next child a lot of the water had evaporated. I bought her a new one and was certain this one would be even better than the first, but unfortunatly I was wrong. The original was so quiet, and this one is quite loud when it is on the bubble setting. We can barely hear the music over the hum of the motor. I'm torn between pulling out the old one or using the new one without the bubbles. All the other features are great. And I like the way the lights change. Oh yah, on the original you could see the lights reflect onto the ceiling. This one doesn't do that. I would have given the original 5 stars, but this one I consider average."
1,BRING BACK PEACEFUL PLANET-P-L-E-A-S-E,"VERY SIMPLE. THIS TOY JUST DOES NOT CUT IT. MY SON CANNOT GET BACK TO SLEEP WITH THIS, AND I CANNOT FIND ANOTHER PEACEFUL PLANET. I WOULD DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TO GET MY HANDS ON ONE. MY SON'S PEACEFUL PLANET'S MOTOR ALSO BURNED OUT, BUT IT WAS USED EVERY DAY, EVERY NIGHT!!. IT COMPLETELY LULLED HIM TO SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS, DIFFERENT SOUNDS, MUSIC, ETC. IT WAS WONDERFUL!! THIS PRODUCT WAS JUST A WASTE OF $$ FOR ME."
5,Buy this toy!!!,"Folks, I am the mother of four kids - two are twins, and one is autistic. This is THE product to buy if you are teaching your baby to fall asleep on their own. My oldest and youngest preferred the water sounds, and the twins preferred the music - the beauty of this toy is that it serves BOTH tastes, so you do not have to find a product that works through trial and error. Additionally, the light feature is soothing and beautiful...perfect for chasing away fears of the dark. I have made it my business to buy this toy for every mother and baby that I love in my life. I encourage you to try this product!!"
2,Love it...HATE IT!,"I have a love, mostly hate relationship with this product. My daughter absolutely loves it.2 hours after I put her to bed she is still pushing the button with her foot and is having a good old time. I have to go in there and physically shut it off. This toy would be awesome IF when you set it to turn off in 5 minutes, the child didn't have the ability to keep turning it back on!!!! What incentive is there to sleep? Not sure this is going to stay in the crib. I don't really need her turning this on in the middle of the night to have fun!"
5,Its the best,"This was bought for my baby as a Christmas present. She is 3 weeks old and it calms her right down. It can be attached to a cradle, changing table and a crib. She likes the brahams Lulabye somg with lights. I don't use the bubbles(makes too much noise and startles her). I was told to stock Pile up on the batteries because they die quickly. I haven't had a problem with the batteries yet. This is a great Crib Toy."
5,2 1/2 years of fun and still going!!,"We definitely have got our money's worth on this toy! Our son has enjoyed this toy every day since he was a newborn and now at 2 1/2 years old still plays it every nap and every night. As an infant he was mesmerized by the bubbles and soft lights and movement, and now as a toddler he still can't give up this toy. It fit securely on his crib and also fits well on his toddler bed. Our son can be tough on his toys and this aquarium has shown no signs of wearing out.Nice features we like included all of the options of 3 different songs with/ without lights or bubbles, or 3 different water sounds (the waves on the beach are nice for relaxing us grown-ups too). The sequence plays 3 times in a row then shuts off until baby or adult presses a large button in front. The adjustable volume is a nice feature as well. We were hoping to pass this aquarium along to our next baby who is on the way, but it looks like we'll be buying a secong one!"
5,Every Mom needs one of these!!!,"This is the best crib toy I have ever found. It has an on/off switch, PLUS a volume control. The music is soothing and melodious, (not loud & obnoxious like toys we have). The lights start out low, then brighten, and the sounds start out soft and get louder. This is great, as it doesn't startle baby out of her bed, plus, it doesn't abruptly shut off and wake baby when it is finished. You can set the music and lights OR one or the other. This was made with Mom's in mind!!The perfect shower gift!"
2,Disappointed.,"My hope was that this toy would help my 2m old son fall asleep and/or keep him occupied for a few minutes. He seemed to like it the first time we set it up...even fell asleep once. Since then, he has showed no interest in it. When I turn it on, he starts crying after a few seconds. I give it two stars because I like the concept and because I remain hopeful that he'll like it when he gets older. I recommend the Tiny Love Mobile instead. That keeps my son's attention for 15 min. and puts him to sleep sometimes."
2,"pretty, but boring","My 5 month old did not like this product. She could turn it on and off right away, but lost interest in 2 minutes. It definitely sounds like an aquarium. I did not like the music. I do like the water sounds, I just wish there was an all night option. That is the only way my baby sleeps. I also don't like the fact that if you change modes (there are 3) you have to reset the sound you want, i.e. crashing waves. Any time you switch modes it automatically goes to the 1st song, which I can't stand. I don't feel it is worth the money."
4,A Wonderful Way To Have Your Little One Drift Off To Sleep,"This is a wonderful toy. My son has enjoyed watching it since he was 8 weeks old. He is now 6 months old and it has grown with him. He now practices his fine motor skills with the switches and turns it on by himself. It is very soothing for him to fall asleep to.The volume switch is very nice. It's has a wonderful variety of sounds to chose from, the ocean's waves, rain, crickets, etc.The only down side I have noticed is that if you use the bubbles setting, it runs the batteries down. But in my opinion, it is definately worth the batteries, it's just a hassle to have to un-attach it from the crib.I would buy this toy again without hesitation."
3,Heavy and Unsafe if not latched to something!,"This toy is pretty cool, in theory that is. In reality it is clumsy, (not sturdy enough to stand on its own) made out of heavy, hard plastic and could cause quite a few bumps and bruises if the infant tries to play with it, while the toy is unattached (from a bassinet, playpen, etc). Though the sounds are nice (other than the loud bubbles and clanking of the fish) and the fish are neat to look at. But really not too much stuff to play with, my infant grew bored of it very quickly. Spend your money on something else."
3,My Daugher Loves....But...,"My daugher loves this toy. Both day and night, it signals that it's time to sleep when she's in her crib. However, after just 4 short weeks, the aquarium has stopped bubbling. I have tried everything including changing the batteries, but it seems that this particular feature is broken. Would expect more from Fisher-Price."
3,Needs to stay on longer,"The sound is very nice and our baby loves it - except it doesn't stay on nearly long enough. It says up to 10 minutes, but I swear it's more like five. I apparently didn't read the description well enough, because I wouldn't have bought it had I remembered/known about the time limit. If I had it to do over, I would get the Baby Einstein version that stays on longer and has a remote to restart it."
2,Great but it shuts off way to soon!,IT should have an option to get it on for longer 20-30min! it only last like 5 and it is annoyong to restart it when the babe is trying to sleep!
2,Not happy,"All this aquarium did was disturb my son's sleep. It seems to be made pretty well, but I don't see the benefit of having one of these in my child's crib. The amount of times he would switch it on and play with it therefore waking himself up was crazy! In the end I removed it. Total waste of money!"
3,Battery Eater,"My baby really enjoys looking at this in his crib but the batteries do not last long!..Maybe if they made an ac adapter, it would be more feasable...The batteries do not last long in this item."
2,Nighty night!,"The most restful music I have ever heard in a crib toy. The lights slowly brighten and dim, and the bubbles are soothing. It has been a great tool to help my son go to sleep on his own. I put him in the crib and turn that thing on (we choose to do just music and lights for 10 minutes usually) and he is asleep before it is done. I wish they made one for grown ups!!"
3,A wonderful item,I got this for my son when he was 2 1/2 months old and he has loved it ever since. It does help him to fall asleep. If he wakes in the middle of the night all I have to do is push the button and he is quickly back to sleep. The music and different sound options are great too!
2,Liked the original Peaceful Planet better- from 3rd time mom,My 3 year old had the original Peaceful Planet Aquarium by Fisher Price and it was MUCH MORE PEACEFUL than this item is for my new baby on the way. The orginal was a life saver because my 3 year old loved that. This new model's motor is way too loud and just does not have the attractive features of it's predecessor.
1,Mothers BEWARE .... it leaks,"This aqaurium has been a lifesaver for me for almost 5 months. Sadly, I have to give it ""1 Star"" because it started leaking last night. The water was sticky (almost like a gel) and had an unusual smell. Luckily, my baby was not in his crib when this happened. Although this has helped many sleepless nights, I am afraid to purchase another one. Hopefully I will be able to find something similar to this to replace it."
2,Too many little flaws add up,"I was really excited to register for this - and really disappointed when I got it. Biggest problem I had was that the moving fish part was broken. I could only get music and lights. But even if that was working, the music itself is wierd and annoying sounding - and really loud. I can't imagine how they think this would put anyone to sleep. The nature sounds setting was ok. Worst part was the button for baby to manipulate. The lever and the spin dial that work the fish were hard for me to use, I can't imagine a baby having the strength and dexterity to work this. And the large button in the middle which allows baby to turn it on themselves was so touchy that they would just start the same song over and over again. Since it has a motor and moving parts, it eats 4 huge D batteries. I can almost see using this as a toy, but not a soothing crib item."
1,Hated it!,"I received the previous model (peaceful aquarium) of this product for my son that is now 3 years old. He still uses it every night to fall asleep. It is such a great item that I bought it for several friends when they had children and added it to the top of my all time favorite baby items list. Now that fisher price has stopped making this item and started selling this new model, I am completely disappointed. I have a 3 month old baby girl who was given this one as a gift. I would return it in a heartbeat if I didn't think my friend would be offended. It is loud, obnoxious and not soothing at all. I can not say enough bad things about it. Fisher Price made a huge mistake when they made this model. It has mechanical sounding music that makes my child cry when I play it. It is AWFUL!!!! I too would pay dearly to have another of the previous model."
4,My son can't sleep without it!,"We LOVE this aquarium. The soothing bubbles and ""white noise"" really put my baby to sleep. We only wish that it would play longer."
5,SOOO CUTE!,"I had the older version(the one that looked like a fish bowl) of this for my daughter when she was younger and she wouldn't go to sleep without it. And in the morning it would entertain her for a little while which gave mom the chance to get a few more minute of sleep! After finally 2 years of non stop playing with it, it died and shortly after I found out I was pregnant with my second baby and this was the first thing I bought, I knew I couldn't live without it!"
4,Helps my baby sleep.,"We used this at nap and bed time since by son was born. Now that he is 16 months, if he wakes in the night he ""fishboxes"" himself! He hits the large blue button and the music soothes him back to sleep. When he was younger we joked that we needed a remote control to start it back up when he would wake up.My only complaint is that it seems to eat the batteries pretty well."
2,Good concept but Needs Work,"Their basic design is good but could be inproved upon easily. We have spent more in batteries for this toy than what it sells for. I guess rechargable batteries would be best. It is cute, but our son doesnt really care for it as much as the one that had lights shine on the ceiling."
5,great toy,"my 9 month old loves to turn the music on and off. i would recommend this toy for any crib. when he wakes up in the middle of the night, he turns the music on and falls back to sleep."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"My son has had this in his crib since he was about 4 months old and he still loves it at almost two! It lets off the perfect amount of light to help baby go to sleep and the selection of music is good as well. My only complaint is that the motor is a little loud when the bubbles are on, but my son doesn't complain about that!!! Definetly recommended!!!"
4,Oceam Aquarium,"I really did like this product and my daughter (8 months) loved it at first. After reading all of the other reviews I decided to give this four stars even though she doesn't like it anymore. I guess she's just spoiled rotten because she couldn't care less about the fact that it's hanging on her crib. She just wants to get out. Maybe she'll like it when she gets older and a little more independant. (If that ever happens!)Also, this may just be a problem with mine, but the volume doesn't turn down very low. Even if she would go to bed with it, I'm sure it would wake her up because it's so loud.If anyone has any suggestions about the volume problem please let me know (vessjl@yahoo.com)."
2,This toy leaks the water...,"I've had this item for two years, and recently had to replace the batteries for the second time, and low and behold, one of the batteries' silver cover was coming off, and it was all corroded. The water was leaking into the battery compartment! I called Fisher Price, and they said that there's only a 1 year warrantly on this item. I then recently went to a store to get another one, and there was only one left, and I saw that it was partially opened, and when I looked at it, it was leaking also! I would no recommend this product."
2,"Great product, bad straps","I received this item as a gift & loved it til my husband tried to get it onto the side of the crib. We have the Lifetime 4 in 1 crib from Babies R Us and the railing is too wide for the straps to fit around. I called Fisher Price to see if they have extentions or replacement straps that are longer and they do not! If you have any other crib than the regular plain one, do not buy this item. Other than rigging it some how to the side of the crib, which is unsafe, I will be forced to part with it and give it away. What a disapointment!First time mom in Pasadena, Tx"
4,Great Crib Toy,"This is a great toy for most babies. DD hasn't been too interested in it until recently, once she turned a year old. It used to scare her (with the loud bubbles or the weird music), but now I know to have it on a good setting (ocean sounds with no bubbles). DD doesn't use it to go to sleep, but rather she plays with it in the morning before crying for me to get her. It's nice to know she has something safe and soothing to play with while in the crib.I had the same problems with attaching it to the crib - I have a Baby Italia crib which has a slightly thicker top rail on the three sides. It was tough to get on (since the straps are not very long), but I got it on finally!I would like to have one of these next to my bed!"
4,Love it!,"Our daughter was born 7 weeks early and was hospitalized for reflux just after her due date, so she was still pretty tiny. They put her in this huge crib while there. One of the nurses brought in the Aquarium for Lainey to use during her stay. She LOVED it. She hated being in the huge crib after being used to sleeping in a snuggly bassinet, but would eventually fall asleep if we kept this on for her. It quickly went on her Christmas list and was installed in her crib at home. She loves to watch it while she settles down for a nap or bedtime. I love the fact that it does NOT eat through the batteries, but we wish the length of time it played was longer. Highly recommend it from birth up. She's 7 months old and still adores it."
2,great toy with one annoying problem..,we got this for our 5-months old daughter. she loves the sound of it but gets upset when the music stops playing. the sound shuts off automatically after 8 minutes and we have to turn it back on as she is still too young to hit the button herself. not sure why Fisher-Price wouldn't make it play longer.
4,Helps her learn to go back to sleep on her own,"I bought this for my daughter when she was just 1 month old, she is now almost two and she still loves it. You can adjust the how low it hangs down in the crib so I have never had a prblem with her head getting hurt. She loves to push it by herself, and when she wakes up in the middle of the night she just sits up and pushes the button and goes back to sleep. The Bubbles are a bit to loud to use when she is older though and the music is also a bit loud for a crib toy. But the running water noise saved us when she was a baby."
3,Wish they woul bring back,"The Ceiling display feature. My older daugter has this and we also have the original one. Some might remember the Peaceful Planet aquarium, I bought that one for my first child and we still have it although it hasn't worked since she was 6 months old. THen we bought this one and it just isn't that much fun, some of the music is annoying and the fact that they can turn it on at will (sometimes in the middle of the night with their foot) waking up my husband and I is a little irratating.I have noticed that the water somehow disappears for some reason, when we bought it new the water was all the way at the top and now the fish are half way in the water. Fisher Price isn't what it used to be and I would recomend that you buy their new bird crib toy instead. That one has a ceiling feature my new daughter and my 2 year old love to look at while I read to thm before bedtime."
5,Highly recommended,"Our son is 13 months old and has enjoyed the Aquarium since he was 1 month old. It is suitable for young infants (soothing sights) as well as older babies (who can start/stop the action and manipulate two small dials). Our son often uses the Aquarium after we put him into his crib for the night, as a way of soothing himself and getting ready for sleep. We highly recommend it--we think the Aquarium is probably his best toy yet. Buy it!"
5,This one is great!,This toy has a hypnotic effect on your little one. My only regret is that we didn't start using it until my daughter was about 4 mos. It is perfect when you need to distract your infant for just a few moments while you wash your hands or get bath supplies together. It will stop tears flowing instantly. When she wakes up I hear her prattling with the toys (she hasn't learned how to start the music herself yet). She is now 6 mos and it still works like a charm. Definitely a crib toy worth purchasing.
5,Very happy,This is the second Ocean Wonders Aquarium I have bought. My son took the first one for his second child's crib. My first grandson won't go to sleep without the Ocean Wonders Aquarium playing its soothing music! It is the best!! I wish I had one for my four children in the '70's!!
3,Buy it when your child is small,"I bought this a few weeks ago because of the great reviews, but so far my 6 month old son won't go to sleep if he is left with it. I think the problem is that he's not used to it so it doesn't soothe him. I should have bought it when he was very young and went to sleep easily so that it would be familiar and soothing to him now.He does enjoy looking at the bubbles when he's not going to sleep (they are a little loud for night time) and he likes watching the fish swim, so it's not a complete loss. I like the choice of music and noises, although it's annoying that every time you turn it off the tune defaults to the first one, not the last one you selected."
4,Great Toy,"We bought this for for 6 month old daughter when she started pulling herself up in the crib. I found that this does not sooth my daughter to sleep and instead when she hears it it wakes her up and she wants to push the buttons. However, she does play with it when she wakes in the morning which gives us parents some more sleep. Infact often I don't even realise she is awake until I hear the music and bubbles from this toy."
4,Helps baby sleep,"My daughter can be lulled to sleep after listening to the music and watching the fish. I have only 2 complaints - the music will only play for 5 minutes, then I have to restart it and the batteries have to be replaced too quickly. Thank God for rechargables."
2,Love the toy....Still Disappointed,"Before I tried to attach this toy to my sons crib, I really loved how it worked. I thought the sounds and the music were great. However, I am very disappointed that because this is our first child who is 3 weeks old, and we purchased a brand new crib, we cannot use this toy. It will not attach to new cribs that have wider top bars. I can use it while he is laying on his play mat and lean it up against something, but I am still bummed because when we were shopping we were looking for a crib toy specificaly. I usually love Fisher Price items, but not this time! They need to keep up with changing models of things such as cribs!"
5,Pretty cool!,"Our baby is 2.5 months old, and she likes to look at it. It's a pretty cool thing to have on the crib. We hope she will be able to enjoy more as she will get older!"
3,No need to stop!,"This toy is wonderful when trying to put my son to sleep, but the problem is that it only plays music for so long and cuts off before he is fast asleep. Which in turn wakes him up and we have to start all over again. If only it was remote controlled, where I could turn it off before I go to bed and I know he is asleep!"
5,Great Product,"My daughter, now 3 months old, has enjoyed this aquarium from the very beginning. The music is soothing, and in the past few weeks I've noticed her turning her head to watch the lights and the fish. We use this as part of her ""sleep"" routine - she almost always goes to sleep shortly after the aquarium is turned on. Occasionally, we'll need to reset it to play again, but this is convenient since you only need to press one button on the front. We bought this for ourselves, but it would be an excellent baby gift for anybody."
4,Babies Love It,We have twins and we like that we have lots of different options with this toy - it can have lights and bubbles when they are in their crib for a little play time or just soft music when it's bedtime. Plus - the water sounds like waves of the ocean really ease our babies into bedtime.
4,Couldn't get a good night's sleep without it!!!,"My seventeen month old has had this on the side of her crib since day one. For months now, whenever she wakes up before us, she hits the music key until we come in and get her. She loves watching the fish bobble around, the lights glowing on and off softly, and _I_ love the different music options buttons on the top! This would help keep the toy from playing the same monotonous songs repeatedly, but they're so unique that even repeated, they're not obnoxious. There's also a volume switch and a switch that allows you (or your little one!) to change the visuals from no motion to glowing lights to bubbling, softly lit aquarium. The ONLY drawback I've found to this toy is that the batteries wear out pretty quickly. Other than that, it has been the best (and most used) toy in her room. Definitely worth purchasing!!!"
4,Baby likes to Turn On/Off with His Toes!,"My son is six months old and enjoys his aquarium. Although I don't use any of his crib toys as ""sleep props"" (things that are necessary in order for him to fall asleep), the bubbles and gentle music are often our morning notice that he has awakened. I like that he feels safe enough and comfortable enough to entertain himself using this toy when he's playing in his crib during the day or before his bath. He especially enjoys turning the music on and off with his toes and likes to spin the ball and open the clam with his fingers. The volume switch is nice because it has a good range. I would caution that if your child is able to roll over that one should be mindful that it is easy for baby to bump his head."
5,This is a Must!,"Since my daughter is only 6 months old and does not sit up yet, I use it mainly at bedtime. The sounds and the lights, work great to get her to relax and sleep.This is a great purchase that I would definitely recommend buying."
4,Great Item,"My baby needs some sort of white noise and this is fantastic. It plays three songs and three water sounds, as well as has settings for it to do everything at once, or just one or two of the options (lights, music, water). She loves the lights and sounds of the rain. This has REALLY helped in her bedtime routine. (The other settings help calm her down during the day.) I highly recommend it. (As a teacher, I don't see how this teaches the baby much, but it DOES ""teach"" her to go to sleep!)"
3,Not the Best Crib Product,I purchased this crib toy for my then 3 month old. Since then the bubbles don't work and it is always sucking up on the batteries. Would highly not recommened this product. My son is now 7 months old adn we purchased the LeapFrog Soother. Just wonderful!!!!
3,"A lifesaver for us, but it really burns the batteries.....","We bought this for our newborn son last year. It soothed him when nothing else would. I am, however, disappointed with how fast the batteries are used up. We spent a lot of money replacing them, because it would begin to drag long before it would completely stop working. It didn't seem to fascinate him much beyond the first couple of months, either, but overall it saved us some grief early on!!"
2,motor way too noisy,"my last baby loved the older peaceful planet aquarium model. Even though it was a battery eater it was worth it. so i got this one for my son, 4 months old. I was very disappointed. I assumed they would improve it. But the motor is so noisy it drowns out the sounds and music. i found it very annoying and returned it. I found the older model at a resale shop and bought him that one. At least we can hear the sound effects, even though it is not as interesting or cute looking than the newer one."
5,Maybe he loves it too much!?,"Our son is eleven months old and this is by far one of his favorite toys - and has been since he was just a couple months old. We can always tell when he's awake after a nap - he turns it on immediately! It's very soothing and I like that you can choose from several music or nature sound selections. But it also keeps him entertained when he's not sleepy!The only complaint I have with it is that it burns through batteries pretty quick. You can select music only, or music and bubbles only - but with all three (music, bubbles, and lights) this thing can use up 4 DDs really quickly! (I imagine being played with non-stop contributes as well!)To the reviewer who asked about sleigh top crib attachment - we also have this kind of crib and it attaches just fine. It might sit on a bit of a slant, but it still works. If that bothers you, I'm sure you could always move it to the front side of the crib which is flat on ours."
5,A must have!!!,"We have the new model and my baby loves it! It helps her to fall asleep at night. Now that she is a bit older, she can turning it on."
2,Motor is too loud,"I just got the Ocean Wonders Aquarium for our daughter. We have the Peaceful Planet, but it always seemed to eat through batteries. I thought this one might be better, but I was wrong. The motor, when the fish swim around, is way too loud for her to fall asleep. I do like to music on this one better than the Peaceful Planet, but I bought so she could watch the fish swim around. I think we will just go back to the Peaceful Planet and deal with changing the batteries all the time...at least she falls asleep."
3,"Doesn't fit ""lifetime"" cribs","If you have a crib that converts to a toddler bed/adult bed, chances are that this (and most other crib-attaching toys) will not fit over the top rails to attach properly. I have looked everywhere and have yet to find a toy that attaches to my daughter's crib. Thought this would be helpful info. to some parents since these types of cribs seem to be really popular now."
4,Great for bedtime,"My son has liked this since he was about 2 weeks old. It started leaking and got the sheet wet, but when I called Fisher-Price about it they sent me a new one at no charge. I have not had the same problem with the new aquarium, so I guess I just had a faulty one. My son loves to look at the lights and it sometimes helps him fall asleep."
4,Baby loves this!,"I was a little unsure after reading some of the reviews comparing this version to the older model, but received as part of my registry anyhow. Baby really does enjoy watching and listening to this toy...especially at night when the room is dark. The soothing songs really do captivate her attention. Even my 6 year old has asked to have this by his bed...he thinks it is cool and will play it for little sis every night. Too bad it doesn't project onto the ceiling like the old model...but baby doesn't seem to mind."
2,Wish It Stayed on Longer,"I have the Peaceful Planet aquarium for my 4 month old, and I see that Fisher Price tried to improve on it, but they goofed. They still only allow it to run for 5 minutes, which isn't long enough for my baby to soothe herself to sleep. Also the motor is loud and when everything stops, everything STOPS! The change from all the stimulation to nothing at all is too startling for her and will make her cry for more. It would be nice if this product would slowly shut itself down and run for a little longer (at least 15 - 20 minutes)."
5,My son is addicted,"We got Ocean Wonders Aquarium as a gag gift for my father, but we felt that a 50 year old was a little too old to appreciate it for its simplicity. My son, who received this when he was 1 month has loved it ever since. And it replaced his mobile as the primary means of crib entertainment. The three settings have allowed him to grow into and to use it at different times of day. And it is portable, so you can travel with it, never having to completely throw off the routine. We like it so much that we have started giving them away as baby gifts."
3,"Nice, but needs to run longer.","My one month old loves this when it's running. My comments would be that I wish it had a feature where you could run the bubbles and lights without the sound. You can turn the sound down all the way, but you can still hear it. My baby likes Baby Bach, so I enjoy putting him in the crib with the Ocean Aquarium and playing his CD in the nursery. Also, it does not run long enough. My baby loves watching it, but it only runs for about 5 minutes, which is not long enough to occupy him. So, I'm continually running back and forth between my home office and the nursery turning it on again and again."
2,Not so great for me...,"To tell you the truth, my 14 month old daughter didn't care for this toy at all. I wanted to buy her something to put in her crib to help lul her to sleep (since we took the binky away, finally). But this toy did no good. And I tried it for a week, I would put her in her crib turn on the music ( I tried all 3 sounds, lights and bubbles) and she kept hitting the button on the front to shut it off. My recommendation would be to put the button to turn the music on and off in another location where the child can't get to it (like the back). I put her to sleep alot quicker by just patting her back. Sorry but She didn't like any part of this toy. I will be taking it back today!"
1,Torture,"This book is about inflicting pain on the reader. It is incredibly difficult to understand and absorb the ideas presented in this book, as the author has a dull, long-winded, and pedantic writing style. Requires rereading many sentences, often just to understand the sentence structure itself, let alone its meaning and context within that section of the book. I can't believe the author intended this as an introduction to Organizational Behavior."
4,You should buy it now !,"I found this book very useful & concise. It gives you the most important issues in points rather than full text, which increases your efficiency with little effort! Its USMLE-case-type questions focus more on the treatment. I wish there could be more questions to give us more practice for the exam. It includes introduction to Anesthesiology, but unfortunately not Urology & Orthopedic surgery. In addition, it doesn't have many pictures or diagrams e.g. x-rays, diseases mechanisms."
4,Right on the MONEY!,Previous reviewer is right on the money. BRS Surgery was a great review book and it worked for me! The questions are very comparable to the difficulty of the shelf exam. Used it along with NMS casebook and did well enough to get Honors!! Outline format is a VERY quick read and you will retain MORE.
3,"ok for basic info, read older Netware 3.12,Intranetware book","Well, 3 stars...why because they only target Netware5 related questions. I just missed out the first exams, and after a resit passed. The exam relates to all netware versions, 3/4/5 which the book does not advise. Get a older Intranetware 4 book and study from that as well. You will need a very rounded knowledge base to get past the exam.ServiceSupport CD gets a large number of questions...why..no idea. I asked Novell, and was advised that they are reviewing this for the next update. Remember this is a added price to netware, but they question you on this.This books is okay for what is between the covers, where it fails is what is doesn't tell you."
2,Waste of money,This book is not cram at all. Not even detail to cover up the exam. I think only good as extra reference for studying. It is waste of money.
2,Need more detail,"This book is good for extr reference, however there is not enought information to pass the exam. I think this book did not meet the standard of exam cram. Topic is too general when you compare it with other sources. This is a waste.Info is out of date, too"
1,DON'T BOTHER WITH 2 DISC SET!!!,"Seabiscuit is a good addition to your DVD library, but save the extra money and buy the single disc. I feel taken by the 2 disc set. The only real addition is the Match Race footage which is only a few minutes. The Winner's Circle, HBO First Look and True Story are all re-edits of the interviews and commentaries on the first disc. It's too bad that the studio did this because I will never pay for extra features again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
3,The Average Guide to Breastfeeding,"If you want to learn about breastfeeding your baby, this book is certainly helpful.If you want to be passionately inspired about all the reasons you should breastfeed (which is especially helpful in those first few DIFFICULT weeks), you should turn to Bill and Martha Sears' The Breastfeeding Book.I bought both books as a first time breastfeeding mom, who at first thought breastfeeding was terrible and exhausting (which it was the first few weeks). Now at 4 months, my baby hasn't had a bottle yet, and it was because of how much the other book motivated me to want to give my baby the best start in life possible. If I had only read this one, I would've been out buying formula within the first month.For those of you still in the rough time, know that it passes. Today everything is easy, stress-free and exhaustion free, and I am thrilled to be bonding with my son in this way.Nothing in this book is bad or offensive, but in my opinion it's just not the best there is."
5,The Only Breastfeeding Book You Need,"This is definitely the best book out there on breastfeeding. I read several others before my baby was born, and thought I was prepared. After having some problems, I had to pay a professional lactation consultant for a home visit. She told me many things that were new or different from what I read in other books. After getting the hang of things, I got The Nursing Mother's Companion, and read several of the same suggestions and tips the nurse gave me at home. This book is easy to read, and very complete, but also very concise. I highly recommend it!!"
5,Get this book!!!,"If you're thinking about breastfeeding - get this book!!! I had trouble with my first son and gave up after the 1st week. Thanks in part to this book, I'm on week #3 and am determined to make it past that first month that everyone says is so hard. I was going to buy the LLL book, but bought this one instead and am SO glad I did. You won't regret spending the money on this one and it'll be something you keep going back to through time."
5,Best book I ever read on the subject!,"I nursed 5 babies before I received a short condensed version of this book as a gift from my doctor. I thought I new all there was to know about the subject. This book helped me to nurse my last two babies with ease. It is a WEALTH of valuable information for the nursing mother, with practical advice that solves problems specifically. I loved it and bought the full book. If you want to breastfeed, you must have it! Laurel"
4,"Comprehensive and Informative, but...","Over all a good reference book for the basics of breastfeeding. I would have liked to see more information on common feeding problems such as Reflux in infants. If just a little information would have been provided on this issue, I think I could have recognized this problem, my daughter would have gotten diagnosed sooner and not suffered so. (No information on this common feeding problem was addressed)."
5,Invest,I bought this book when my daughter was 3 months old and wish I had gotten it earlier. It is very helpful and has lots of information from pregnancy and beyond. I recommmend anyone who plans on breastfeeding to buy this book.
4,A great breastfeeding reference!,"The lactation consultant recommended this book when I went to the hospital-sponsored breastfeeding class, and it is a wonderful book! I turned to this reference book throughout the first few months of my baby's life as I exclusively breastfed him for over 6 months. It covers many topics that nursing moms have concerns about - engorgement, latching problems, weaning - in a way that is concise and easy to read.I highly recommend this book to my friends who plan to breastfeed as it was extremely helpful for me when I went through those first few uncertain months."
5,Excellent!,"I highly recommend this book. I read it before my son was born, took it to the hospital with me (and used it), and referred to it repeatedly during many months of successful nursing."
3,Covers all bases but is very very repetitive!,"Though very helpful and it does seem to cover all area and questions/concerns a mother may have, it's also extremely repetitive! In every chapter I felt like I was re-reading something from the last chapter almost word for word. The same topics are addressed over and over. The book could be cut in half and still cover all bases."
5,The most helpful breastfeeding book out there.,I received an excerpt out of the book at the hospital and later ordered the book. It covers every situation you may encounter while breastfeeding. I have shared my copy with all my nursing friends and they have found it to be a priceless reference.
4,A true Companion!,"Well organized and concise. Best part is the list of medications and their effect on breastmilk, although it could be more exhaustive."
2,Save your money,"Most of the advice provided in this book can be obtained for free (and more consisely) from your OB/GYN, hospital and health insurance company. The only parts I found useful were the appendices for drug interaction during breastfeeding and contact information for nursing products. BEWARE! Advice given in this book for starting solid foods contradicts the current guidelines given by the American Academy of Pediatrics--some foods recommended in this book are peanut butter, whole eggs and some nitrate-rich foods that should be avoided/given in moderation until your child is older. I would much rather follow the advice of a full-fledged DOCTOR."
2,Good for common problems only,"I bought the book since I was suffering from this extreme pain after nursing and none of the doctors I was going to really knew what was going on. After doing research in the internet, I figured it was thrush and the book was of no use to me, since it does not cover thrush"
2,Credibility Problem,I found out that the author of this book is taking money from formula companies. Apparently she works for a company that accepts formula advertisements. It's difficult to believe objective advice on breastfeeding can come from an author being paid by the formula industry. That's like the cigarette industry giving advice on quitting smoking.
4,"""Survival"" Sections are great ""","This book answered a couple of questions that went unanswered in the Sears Breastfeeding book and in the LLL ""Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"", so I found it worth having.Worth noting: the author, Kathleen Huggins is the lady who patented the ""My Brest Friend"" nursing pillow - a great nursing tool!This book features ""survival"" sections which are highlighted for easy access and summarize the events of the child's and mother's breastfeeding needs at particular stages: ""Survival Guide for the First Week"", ""Suvival Guide for the first 2 months"", ""Survival Guide for months 2-6"" and ""Survival Guide for the Later Months""None of my three breastfeeding books have all the answers, but I think that if you bought this book and the Sears book, you will have all the info you need."
5,Questions Answered,"This book is an excellent resource for nursing mothers. From positioning to remedies for common breastfeeding ailments, Kathleen Huggins makes you realize you aren't alone out there! She dispells many common myths and misconceptions about breastfeeding with excellent advice to boot. This book gave me great confidence in my natural ability to nurse my baby successfully."
4,A Wonderful Reference Guide,"As a first time mother, I must say that breastfeeding didn't come ""naturally."" I met with a lactation consultant 3 times, and after that I referred to this book over and over again.The back of the book has an extensive index of drugs and their effects on a breastfed baby. Now that I've got the breastfeeding gig down, I know that I'll still turn to the index to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep my daughter from the harmful effects of medications that I may be inclined to take!"
4,Said to be the best guide to breastfeeding...,"This guide came very highly recommended, and I can see why. It is very easy to follow, and is filled with lots of information I (and my wife) didn't know. The author comes across in a very straightforward way that is not militant about breastfeeding, as some authors are. ""If you don't breastfeed, you're guilty of child-abuse,"" some books say. Come on!One of the particularly useful sections of the book was the section on breastpumps. Many books on the market have outdated lists with obsolete models.If you're interested in breastfeeding your child, and want a book that explains things in an easy to understand way, this is the one for you."
5,The best resource for breastfeeding!,"This book is by far the best, most comprehensive resource for the breastfeeding mom. I turned to this book regularly during the first few months (especially the first weeks!) of my son's life. The writing is direct and simple without being preachy, and the solutions for basic breastfeeding issues were right on the money.Despite the fact that breastfeeding is painted out to be ""natural and instinctual"" - it isn't. If you only buy one book to get you on the road to breastfeeding with confidence, this is it."
3,"Read Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding, instead","The Nursing Mother's Companion is an easy-to-use manual on breastfeeding. It has good chapters on positioning and solving some common breastfeeding problems. HOWEVER, the author seems to hold the commonly held belief that because breastfeeding is ""natural"" it will work for everybody. She does not provide information on how to diagnose and treat the problem if breastfeeding isn't going well. I have a low milk supply, a somewhat common problem which this author doesn't seem to recognize the existence of. Furthermore, my low milk supply probably could have been avoided if I had had Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding in my first few weeks, instead of this book."
5,much needed,"i think is book is invaluable period! it'll help you make it to 1 year which is best for baby, answers all queations & concerns!"
1,Technical Details,The prongs in the actual report covers are not as shown in the picture and not described well in the technical details. What a surpise to find that each prong consists of one small piece of metal to bend back rather than the usual 2 pieces in a wing shape that hold the paper in securely.
5,quality and value,i use this report covers all the time and never have any problem.i would recommend this product. the price is good and so the quality
4,"Descent price, and item.",There is not special about these. You get a fair item for the price. I have no complaints and having the various choices of colors to choose from is good.
1,"McMillan & Wife, 2nd disc bad...","My second disc, side one, skips, pauses, rolls back -- tell me how can I right this?"
2,tacocop,the showa were great ....But.... the disks do not work properly in my player .... the disks will not change espisodes.....junk dvds
5,MacMillan and Wife - 1st season,"This is easy for me. I have always been a huge fan of this show and I have been searching high and low for DVDs which I finally found with Amazon. I was just elated and jumped at the chance. Hopefully other seasons will follow because, as is the case with many fine shows, it's quality improved with each season and these shows are worth rewatching over the years.N.F."
3,Season 1 - MacMillan & Wife,It was great to finaly have the entire first season together. A great job was done on putting this to DVD. Good clear picture and sound. Looking forward to the season 2 release.
2,McMillan,"Series was great but the disk, I believe disk 2 with the episode with Barbara McNair skips on both sides. Haven't had time to return the set. Hopefully the whole lot wasn't bad."
2,BOYCOTT UNIVERSAL TV SERIES BOX SETS,"Lets starting boycotting TV series to DVD box set, from Universal/MCA, they are the only ones, that charges the highest price. Also Universal/MCA are the only ones, that don't provide the original music, so maybe if sales drop, they will start providing the episodes uncut, with the original music, instead of the cheap substitute music, they give us now!"
3,5 stars for show/1 star for universal dvd's,"Love Mcmillan & wife, but having the same problems as other reviewers. Two skips on disc 1 side A which create big gaps in the storyline, but luckily it didn't stop playing completely once I hit the play button again. But it keeps freezing at the same spot every time, and I'm using a brand new dvd player. This show is so fun to watch, and it is extremely annoying that Universal appears to have produced defective dvd's en masse."
2,I'll Echo the Bad DVD Reviews,"I've bought quite a few movie DVDs and have never had any problems.I purchased McMillan & Wife, Season One and had a problem with the first disk. It hung up on a show and froze and rendered that show useless.The movie industry could have a gold mine with these shows of the past--but they need to improve the quality of their DVDs.Needless to say, I'll read all the reviews before I purchase any more McMillans."
5,Mac and Sally equal Chemistry,"The plots weren't always the most intricate.The production value of sets was minimal.But, my oh my did Rock and Susan have the chemistry.I loved them together. However the plot may drag in spots, whenthose two were on screen together, it was magic.And John Schuck was simply superb as Enright.And then there was Mildred. I smile just thinking of Nancy'sinspired performance.Watch out for Sally and Mildred plotting together. Chaos will ensue<G>You gotta love Mac's hideously dated wardrobe. What a wonderful hoot. I had forgotten.Great guest stars often propelled the plots above the ordinary.But, it was all about Rock and Susan.And it worked fabulously. And thanks to the advent of DVD, it still does.One technical note about the cds. I detest these double sideddiscs! What a hassle."
1,Universal needs to recall BAD DVDs.,"Universal seems to be having problems with their DVDs of TV Shows.I gave my wife the McMillan and Wife Season One set. It freezes and skips throughout. It's a shame because she loves the show. The discs are not damaged in any visual manner...no smudges or scratches. They just freeze.She gave me the Dragnet series of DVDS...another Universal product.My joy turned to aggravation though as those Discs kept freezing up as well.And it is not just our DVD player. We have four in the house and it did it in all of them.It's obvious Universal is having a problem with the production of DVD's.I did a little checking on the internet and it appears alot of other people are having the same problems. Universal needs to recall their compilation series.Evidentially the Adam-12 discs have the same problem.So be warned, if you buy Universal TV series DVD's, there could be problems."
4,Bring on the 70's!!,"I grew up watching this show on tv and it was good then. Its only gotten better for me since. I had forgotten how deadly handsome Rock could be, and the effortless ease with which he and Susan St. James bantered back and forth. Its a joy to watch and I helped them solve each and every crime. Well worth the money."
2,terrible dvd,"I give the show 4 stars.but,the dvd package 1. the second disc skips on 1 show.and,the other shows won't even play. i don't know if writing to universal whoud help or not. i wish there was something that choud be done."
4,season one of mcmillan and wife,"a fabulous walk down memory lane with rock hudson and susan st james. can't wait for the follow up seasons to become available.my only wish was for ""dvd"" extras, perhaps some background or behind the scenes info can be dug up for future dvd's."
5,abosolutely fabulous!,"The first series brought back so many memories of when this aired on tele, had to get permission to stay up at 9-30pm when it was shown on tele here in Australia, I was a lot younger back then, had a crush on rock hudson! lavish!"
1,Excellent show on lousy disks,"I read other reviews about the poor disk quality but thought I'd get luckly, which I didn't. The very first episode skipped and finally stopped altogether near the end. I tried it on 2 different players with the same result. Cheap double sided dvds. I expect more of the same on the other episodes. A great show treated shabbily with cheap disks. If you haven't bought Hart to Hart yet get that instead."
4,I adore McMillan & Wife,"I'm so grateful that McMillan & Wife is now on DVD. There is so much humor, along with the action, and I don't get tired of rewatching the shows. There are inside jokes about living San Francisco, with the traffic jams and strikes. Rock and Susan really work well together (there seems to be a genuine fondness between them that is lacking in most on-screen couples), and the supporting cast members also get to ham it up. I really, sincerely hope that more seasons of this show will be made available."
5,Outstanding series -- just completed first viewing!,"Just finished viewing the entire season for the first time! Never saw it when it was first broadcast because I was attending night classes -- didn't know what I was missing! This is an updated Nick and Nora Charles and Mr. and Mrs. North put together with Hudson's charm and Saint James' sweet humor. Can't wait to see season two! Every episode is different -- no predictable, pat formula plots -- an outstanding chase scene in first episode. Curiously, in the final episode Sally is suddenly pregnant, and you don't exactly know whether Mac is aware of it. A great series -- get on the ball with the rest of the series!"
5,HOLY SHIT,"THe first one leaves you hanging a little, but after that you will so pissed that you have to wait for the next disc to arrive. It will drive you nutz. However not reccomended for children at all. Tons of gore and a few sex scene occur later on in the series."
1,Sold out..,"This series sold out on what the creators probably thought would sell DVDs. I don't mind watching a good anime with cussing, violence and some nudity. But that's all this series is. The plot is weak. 2 episodes per DVD is nothing to be happy about either. (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Comples has 4 per DVD) The animation quality is decent. While watching this DVD, I could almost see a worthwhile story underneath the useless swearing, but it appears the creators decided to focus more on weak battles scenes and (..) than on a quality story line. This just left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Strange But True,"People who casually cross paths in the real world find themselves in a sick, twisted game for their new lives.You hear their thoughts, you see their perversions, you see them die.Gantz is unapologetic and doesn't hide the gruesome and frail nature of humanity. Throw in some aliens and guns and you get Gantz.The premiss of the story is brilliant.There are only two episodes per disc so I recommend getting it used."
3,Another home-base business book from the Edwards,"Working at home seems like a dream for many. The Edwards have written several books on working on home. Their advice is sound and filled with common sense. However, this book does not rate a 5 because it is lacking in details about individual businesses you can start at home. They do have other home businesses books, as I stated. These are filled with 3-5 pages at the most on some individual businesses, but does not go too far into details about each, obviously. But for an overview of starting a home-based business at all, this is a decent book."
3,misleading,"I was looking for a possible lead to an opportunity to do work at home. This book has some ideas that might work, but a lot of them aren't really feasible. The majority of these ideas require an investment of at least $1K and some $10K or more. Wasn't too pleased."
3,"A must read for locals, former locals, and guys from Medford...","There was no way I wasn't going to read this book. I grew up in the Medford neighborhood where a lot of this story takes place, and was living there when the robbery happened. I've always wanted to read a book on the subject, so I'm glad to have ""The Cops Are Robbers"". I just wish Clemente had got himself a better ghost writer, as this is a poorly written book. Regardless, the story is fascinating enough to get you through the bad writing, so read it anyway if your a fan of the ""true crime"" genre."
1,I don't know why,...why I even got this book. It was one of those free ones they offered. A few day's of my time wasted
3,SKIN DEEP,the book has a good story line and i liked the way it was presented to the reader. there were times when i felt that it was a little drawn out. i found myself skipping a couple of pages.
5,The bomb,"This book was great from page one to the end. Nina didn't feel she was black enough for people because she was so light. Ahmad was a strong brotha, who was good for nina. I couldn't believe when his daugther's aunt told him that he shouldn't allow his daughter around nina because she was light. At one point I througt Nina was gonna turn out not to be black, but I was end for a shock with the ending.The author did a great job for this to be her first book."
4,"An Uplifting ""Must-Read"" for All Hearts!","Drawn by the description on the back cover, I purchased this book at a local supermarket, the author unknown to me. It was amazingly different from other novels of the type, far surpassing any expectations. The Spiritual association is especially appreciated. I found the characters to be genuine, with the scope of thought well covered. A subject for further discussion and development is the difference in reaction Nina and ""T"" had to Rasheed's poem (blame vs bootstrap). In addition I would like to see how Nina, mature in head and heart, would resolve a different reality -- suppose she was a white individual raised with an African-American world-view? This contemporary (thank you!) story would translate well to television, or as an independent film. More, please!"
3,Insightful,"Skin Deep gives an oppulent view of dealing with the prejudices and perils that often accompany being of mixed heritage. Kathleen also delves into how one knows who they are. Do you define your race and character according to your color, creed, and parents, or do you define yourself by who you've loved and those that love you back? The story made me think about such things. Insight is all that I received though. I never developed a relationship with the characters of Skin Deep. I really didn't care what happened to them or how their problems were solved. This bothered me because I thought the idea for the story was awesome, but I needed more of a connection or deep caring for the characters. It took me a while to finish the story. I didn't race home from work to read it. Nevertheless, Skin Deep's theme was unique and the point of view held me through out the novel."
5,Thought provoking page turner!,"The romance in Skin Deep unfolds so beautifully and the female relationships are solid. This novel is riveting with mystery and sensuousness as it explores race issues in an inspiring way. The novel made me think. And I learned a bit about myself in the process. But, mostly I fell in love with the characters and was cheering for them throughout. I have already passed the book on to a friend and can't wait to read Schooling Carmen!"
4,Very interesting...,"This novel provided me the opportunity to see life through Nina's eyes (well, someone like Nina). Although I have relatives who have coloring like Nina, I never really considered how intra-color discrimination affects them.I would recommend this novel for anyone who feels that African- American females with an ivory or cafe-au-lait color have it ""easy."" To me, this novel clearly shows that having a lighter hue ""ain't all that,"" although Nina was blessed to have her parents during her childhood to help her develop a strong sense of who and what she is.This novel helped me to re-evaluate my own color attitudes and prejudices when it comes to African-Americans of the lightest hue."
3,a thinking person's romance novel...,"in general, Skin Deep is a breezy, entertaining, and at times a quite moving read, exploring important issues like the connection between self loathing and interracial dating, single parenthood, and the confusion caused by the conflict between one's socialized racial identity and their biological racial make-up. good stuff that was handled persuasively and even-handedly by a very competent first-time writer. however, i've read in some of the other 'online reviews' that other readers found the ending to be 'surprising' and 'strong', but i couldn't disagree more. i personally found the ending to be a bit pat, manipulative, and (ironically) soap opera-ish. certainly this story and the important issues so deftly and subtly handled in the rest of the novel deserved a better, less sensationalized, more organic conclusion. still, a solid first novel. support this sista and buy it. tell your friends to buy it. spread the good word... peace."
4,Great Twist.....,I ordered the book to evaluate for my Book Club reading list. I plan on recommending it for our optional choice of reading for the year. I think Ms. Cross did a great job trying to cross the barriers of the skin color battle. I must say that she got me good with the twist at the end of the book...
4,Skin deep,"Good read, really enjoyed, a great book to just sit and take time out for, a feel good book for anyone to read"
5,Strategic Technologies,Thank you Amazon. I placed the order on a Friday and received it on a Tuesday even with the busy 4 of July holiday traffic! This is what I call excellent service!
2,Not a fan.,"This textbook is boring and more about other people's experience than actually explaining Hospitality Information Systems. While beneficial, too much reading about other people's lives gets old real fast."
5,Great perspective overview of a complex subject,"This book makes great reading for students and veterans alike. After over 25 years in hospitality technology, I still found nuggets of golden information inside. Particularly useful are the sections on inventory management and channel distribution - two of the most complex and important subjects faced by managers in the hospitality industry today. This was written as a text. Well, I admit that I skipped the learning activities at the end of each section. But I made up for it by recommending the book to many industry friends."
4,Easy to read.,It was easy to read. It was a good look at tongues and the Holy Spirit from a non-Pentecostal perspective.
5,Haibane Flies,"I don't think I've ever watched a series quite like Haibane Renmei. The first few episodes really got me aching to watch more. An almost impromptu anime based on a doujinshi by the artist of SE Lain, the story is quietly compelling and has a mystical feel to it. The characters are charming and very realistic, and the settings are wonderfully drawn to resemble a rustic european town. Much of color scheme is soft, warm colors. Paired with realistic character design, HR becomes very down-to-earth. The central plot revolves around Rakka her mysterious 'birth' into an enclosed city of winged people who cannot fly. The story unfolds slowly, and I've no clue how the plot will develop and how the series will end. It's rare to have an anime with such a mysterious and totally unpredictable storyline, so I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series."
2,Hollywood by Gore Vidal,"With an absolute grip on detail, Gore Vidal describes an era: the presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Warren Harding. Vidal's storytelling skills are venerable, however, the text often reads like a stream of consciousness rather than one marked by satisfying conclusions on his characters' actions. Rather than being swept up in the narrative, I kept getting lost in the vast number of characters introduced. Vidal's incisive wit seems to have been tempered by age to the point of blandness at times.. Hearst, Hollywood, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt drift through the pages without bringing impact to the story.I still love anything Vidal writes, but this book disappointed me.Judith ClancyKyoto, Japan"
5,Another Great Epic from Mr. Vidal,I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.
2,"Title should be Washington, D.C.","I bought this book because it was ostensibly about Hollywood during the golden days of the silent movies. I found the beginning of the book so tedious I actually stopped reading it-- starting over again a few months later. After at least one hundred boring pages introducing endless Washington characters (trying to sort out their relationships to each other is mind numbing), you finally get a glimpse of Hollywood. The book then goes back and forth, with the majority of ""action"" (a term I use very loosely) taking place in the east. I enjoyed the last fifty pages or so. If you like Gore Vidal, okay read it. But if you are interested in old Hollywood--I suggest you skip this book and find something else."
4,written 40 yr. ago,I had heard about this author and decided to track down his material. I just wasn't drawn to it once I started reading.
3,Need the Book,"Although I made the mistake getting the workbook, I have to wait til I get the book in order to rate the workbook properly"
5,SPECTACULAR!,the best compilation of jazz music ever! this is a must for all music lover and you'll know after you've listened
5,A Must for All Committed LWIII Fans,"Although not his finest album, this one is still very good and is a definite ""must"" for anyone who is a die-hard Loudon fan (like me). You will get your money's worth many, many times over."
4,Very good Loudon Album,"I bought this Album for Two songs 1.Five years old and Westchester County. If you are a Wainwright fan, this should probably be in your collection. I had the LP version which i wore out."
5,Fun for everyone,"Tommy DoLittle is a fun and funny picture book about what happens when perpetually pajama-clad Tommy,the laziest boy in the world- so lazy that his dog walks him- actually reads the words in a book. His subsequent adventures are as improbable as they are amusing, and Rowe's illustrations are witty and bursting with energy. Kids will want to read this over and over again."
2,Feels disconnected,"Although my kids (5, 4, and 2) enjoy the pictures, the storyline felt disconnected/lacked smooth transitions. I had to explain a lot of what was going on to my kids rather than the story telling itself as most children's books do."
1,Disgusting,"Horrible headphones. Complete static. No bass. I STRONGLY recommend that you NOT buy these. Battery life very low, complete opposite of sound cancelling, with volume all the way up, you can hear it in the other room. If you are looking for wireless headphones, these are not the answer, a complete waste of $80"
1,Avoid buying this product!,I read the user review somewhere else and I ignored them. What a fool I am . This product did not pick up any signal from my TV or Radio. Avoid buying this product. I had it return within 3 days of trying.Trust me. DO NOT buy this product (Sennheiser R40).
3,"Sound quality good, tuning can be a headache","Moving from one room to another requires you to fiddle with the tuning. The sound quality is quite good, with a good low frequency response.I was afraid that I would snap the headband while adjusting it.(though it did not!)I am not sure if this is an advantage or a disadvantage:I could catch my neighbour call his doctor on his 900 MHz cordless phone !! I was wondering if my music would blare out of his cordless."
5,Great buy for the price,I haven't tried going beyond about 100 feet but the reception has been great. I think the sound is exceptional. It is easy to set up and to use. The on-headset tuning is easy and stays adjusted. The automatic battery charging when the headset is placed in the holder is a real plus. My only minor complaint is that the volume control and tuning wheels are close together and it is fairly easy to move the wrong one.
2,Not for soft sounds,"This is my first pair of cordless headphones, and I'm not particularly impressed. The strong points are convenience (it is nice to walk around the house in freedom) and comfort (they're heavier than most corded headphones but not bad, and the earpads are comfy). But the sound quality is not what I had hoped: there is clear distortion in mid-range sound, bass capability is fair at best, and static can be a problem even within 15 feet of the base when the headphones are at certain orientations. Your level of satisfaction will likely depend on the type of music to which you listen; most rock and jazz will sound acceptable, but fans of vocal or classical music will grit their teeth when the grating distortion clobbers a nice passage. Despite the shortcomings I will keep this pair for primarily their convenience, but the next pair I buy will be a high-quality corded set."
5,Very good dictionary,"There aren't many English-language resources for Ukrainian, but this dictionary is about as good as you can get. I can recommend it."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is an amazing ""one-stop-shop"" for a very wide range of management and leadership tools. I love the concise explanations for each tool and usefulness for real-world application. Excellent charts, diagrams and matrices. Very well organized and easy to understand. As a management professional, this book is an important staple of my personal reference library. Well worth the money."
5,Un libro incomparable.,"Sin duda es una de las mejores novelas que jamás se han escrito.En ella se puede encontrar un relato sobre las guerrasnapoleónicas y la participación de Rusia en ellas, pero tambiénun retrato de la vida de la alta sociedad rusa de la época. Estassituaciones tan diversas están narradas con una gran viveza.Aprovechando el trasfondo histórico de la novela, Tolstoi nosproporciona también sus visiones sobre la Historia yel papel que los hombres representan en ella. Estas impresionesno rompen la narración, sino que la complementan de formamagistral.El gran volumen de la novela puede asustar a algunos lectores,pero en el caso de esta novela merece la pena: cada página selee con verdadero placer."
1,Esta versión está recortada,"La novela es genial, inmortal, imperecedera. Pero esta versión que vende Amazon es un versión recortada e incompleta, casi la mitad de la novela que autorizó Tolstoi. No sé si es la misma versión que edita en papel la editorial Juventud que es la mitad de la novela completa. Fue un chasco para mí descubrirlo, pues ya la tenía en papel en la edición de Planeta con la traducción de Alcántara y Laín Entralgo e introducción de Eduardo Mendoza y al compararlas me di cuenta. Espero que Amazon ponga a la venta esta novela en la versión completa, preferiblemente en la traducción de Lydia Kuper. Pr eso mi valoración es por esta versión en concreto no a la novela en sí."
3,Disappointed!,"I teach environmental science and was hoping to find a good documentary about overfishing to share with my class. I have been using 'Empty Oceans, Empty Nets' for years, but since it came out 10 years ago, I felt it was time to replace it. That film is only 60 minutes long, but much more efficiently gives the same info as the End of the Line which is twice as long. Sure, the latter has nice cinematography. It also seems more hyped, like a persuasive documentary. I was disappointed with the film and felt a bit misled by all the rave reviews here. But then again, I'm comparing it to another film which I liked and now recommend over this one.I will continue showing Empty Oceans. For more info: [...]"
2,Out-of-Date,"When it was written (in 1993) it was a fairly useful book on computer fonts. Today most of the technology has changed so many topics are irrelavent. For example, in this time before True Type fonts were widely available, he discusses non-scable fonts, font cartridges and dot matrix printers. Also the last third of the book, which contains specimens of fonts, addresses for font vendors and reference books, is also out date."
2,voowho? what-man?,"bad thing--this movie would have been better if it showed here (as on utube) the monsters' face & more of its whole self-was ""up"" w/ that?--here we sure know whats ""down""--ridiculous waste of monsta. movie would have been better using the monster more."
3,Nice Little airplane,"General airplane which is perfect for my 3 year old. I thought it would be a little bigger, it is about the size of my hand."
3,A Bit Misleading,"When I bought this little plane (and I do mean little) the description said that it would turn left, right, go forward and backward. Actually it only goes forward and backward, and when in reverse it automatically turns in one direction. Now I see that the description has been changed, which is good, but I feel I was misled.Also, don't be led into believing that this plane is more than five inches long. If five inches qualifies as ""medium"" in your book, you'll love this plane. :-)"
1,Disappointed,"SO disappointed in it. Totally not worth the money, SO DISAPPOINTED. I could have had a BIGGER airplane for this kind of money."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The toy worked the first 2-3 days of use. My grandson liked the lights and noise it made. After the 3rd day we thought it needed new batteries. We replaced the batteries in the remote and the airplane, still does not work. My grandson is very disappointed. I will probably not return it because of return shipping and the hassle, I'll look at it as a $10 waste. Save your money for something else, buying AA batteries and a 9 volt is not worth it. Screws strip out and are easily lost. Don't expect much for size either is it about 4 inches in length."
4,Swinging tenor playing,"This is a lovely compilation of Jacquets work with the Verve label from 1951 to 1958. Famous for his solo on 'Flying Home' with Lional Hamptons band, here he is still in superb form whether playing ballads or burning incendiary solos on tracks like Ellingtons 'Cotton Tail'.The album is full of great musicians:Art Blakey - Drums, Herb Ellis Oscar Moore - Guitars, Ray Brown Brown & Red Callender - Bass, Hank Jones - Piano and Organ, Count Basie - Organ, Ben Webster - Tenor Sax, Roy Eldrige - Trumpet etc etc. They don't all play on the same track!The sleeve notes by Pianist Brian Preistley summarise the recordings well and I strongly recommend it."
1,Engine Room Starboard,"I borrowed a teammate's copy of this book and was disappointed. I would agree Ms. Hall has certain gifts as a writer and I'm sure journaling this was therapeutic for her, but I think I'd like to read her husband's account as well - like the old saying goes, it takes two to tango. Fortunately most gen x women finally understand that economic self-sufficiency & having one's own career is the way to go from the beginning (i.e., to avoid dependence on another)."
1,NOT Drawn...,"Many reviews led me to believe this book would be inspirational... but I just found myself thinking that Sara Hall was the most histrionic writer that I have read in years... her approach to her children was deplorable, her constant perseveration and use of unnecessary language made the book difficult to finish. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"
2,Heavy on content but short on motivation,"The book did not seem very well thought out as a book in itself. The information within was very minor, and the routines did not seem as ultimate as the cover suggested in achieving the athletic body or performance as Dan O'Brien possesses. The most disturbing aspect was the graphic content inside. Most exercise demonstrations were in pencil sketch. Text was large, as if filling up space, and the design concept at the start of each chapter was too busy. It had the feel of a rushed book, and that Dan didn't even have time to perform the routines himself so drawings were made of him instead; which made knowing how to perform the workouts correctly & safely difficult to gauge. It also lost the personal touch that most books have because I never felt that Dan was actually there with me at every step."
3,NOT ALL THAT GOOD.,"I am sorry to say that I must agree with another reviewer here in that this book does not quite hit the mark. It is rather poorly done and the information it contains in pretty standard stuff, i.e. just about any work out book you can name has pretty much the same information contained here. The design of the book is poor, at best with sketches which are not all that good or informative. All in all, this work was rather disappointing and I think if you would like to read it, it would be better to check it out from the library rather than come up with the purchase price. I would have much more enjoyed a good biography of Dan O'Brian himself. That, I think, would be interesting and I am sure much more motivational. I did give this one three stars simply because O'Brian is O'Brian. Wish this one could have been better."
3,pretty expensive!,"This book was okay. It was better than most of the books about Mexico I've been reading with my daughter (she is really turned on by Dora the Explorer). The part she liked the most was the discussion about the history of chocolate and the recipe for making hot chocolate... it was certainly a more interesting way to talk about food culture than ""Mexican people eat tacos,"" which is what most of the other books in her age range that we've read say."
3,NRBQ clever band,"the Q is awesome .But this is not even close to being their best. Yankee Stadium is #1 Tiddly Winks Is a close 2nd they are really clever, nice and authentic The Best band The U.S.A. has ever had Except maybe The ByrdsDave E."
5,First-rate film,"Not being an ""action"" movie buff, I was somewhat surprised that I was hooked on this film. Everything about it was superb. Well acted, very well directed and kept my interest right up to the final credits. The description of this film as a gay ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was apt, although I still look forward to the day when we don't have to use ""gay"" to describe a film as anything other than what it is, a great film."
2,Dead Nazi Society,"""Before the Fall"" is an extremely well-made film that suffers from a cliche-riddled and simple-minded script. Boy goes to Nazi school. Boy witnesses the evil of the Nazi system. Boy fights against the Nazi system. I've seen this movie before. And so have you; it was called ""Dead Poets Society."" The problem with movies like this is that they are predictable, relying on formulas to propel the story forward. Despite its beautiful cinematography and good acting, this movie falls over and never gains the strength to get back up."
2,superboy goes to germany,"an utterly silly movie about school boys in the era of hitler youth. its hard to trivalize this era, but this cross twixt ""rocky"" and ""loneliness of the long distance runner"" succeeds. i shall waste no more time on it."
4,Good quality size 1 ball,The ball is in a good round shape (some Size 1 balls aren't.) and has good feel of touch. Overall good quality.
1,Remake not the original,Very disappointed. Should have been marked 'new stereo recordings by original artist or members of the original group'. Sorry that I purchased this item. Doesn't sound like the original songs.
1,A serious misstep ................,She's pretty enough to be a model but not a good enough singer to even do backup vocals.
5,Great Tent & Tunnel! Will withstand the test of time.,"I bought this for my son 3 years ago when he was 1. He played HARD with it for 2 years and I stored it away for a year. I just pulled it out for my 1 year old daughter, washed it and it looks amazing.Thinking back on the abuse the tent and tunnel took and the amazaing shape it is in compelled me to write this review. There were periods of time it was left outside for weeks. It withstood many playdates. There is not so much as a tear in it. Hightly recommend!!"
2,Not Durable Enough,"We bought this tent as a gift for our three boys, ages 1,3, and 5. This is a WONDERFUL toy. However, after only 3 months, one of the supporting poles cracked. Now we can not set up the tent without it falling over. For the price and durability, I suggest another tent purchase."
4,Fun,"I have a in home day care with 6 kids, I bought this last year of 2002, and I still have it up and the kids still pay with it. lots of fun"
3,I think my kids are still too young.,They played for 15 minutes or so and haven't looked at it again since. I just think they're too young (2 years). Easy to assemble.
5,Great Fun,"We bought this for our grandson for Christmas, when he was 22 months old. He loves it! The only problem is he sometimes uses it to get away from his parents when he doesn't want to do something and they have to crawl in after him."
2,Not impressed,"I was disappointed in the tent part of this set. It's flimsy, and the corners slide/collapse in too easily making the floor space much smaller. The tunnel part is great, though. I much prefer the pop-up house that my kids have."
4,Good,We bought this for our 11 months daughter. She scared tunnel at first but she enjoys it now. This is larger than expected but we are ok.
4,A mom of three,"We bought this tent for my daughter for her birthday when she turned 3 in July. It was easily her favorite gift. She and her little brother (not yet two) played with it all the time. Then, she wanted to start sleeping in it. Granted, the tent has been used quite a bit, however, it is breaking in several places. The mesh is tearing a bit, but the main thing is that the bottom pieces that hold the bars in place have given in, and the support bars just slide straight through. I have had to sew them, but they continue to work their way through. I think it is an excellent toy, but I would shop for one a little more durable."
5,we don't wish to be disturbed,I bought this toy for my almost two-year old grand-daughter because she loves to climb under furniture with tableclothes and hide. She loves it and so does her almost five year old sister. Christmas day they climbed in and we were informed they were camping and didn't wish to be disturbed. I plan on getting some more tunnels to add to it soon.
5,Pacific play tent - Lots of fun & adventure play!!!!,It took no time to put up or take down. My daughter is a year and a half and loves it. She can play hide & seek and & I can join her. I am able to move in & out too!!! We have tons of fun. I Highly recommend it! We use it indoors and out!
4,A nice hideaway...,"Our one year old really enjoys this. We ended up disconnecting the tunnel, as it took up quite a bit of space. Though when we place it in another room, our son will sit and hang out in the tunnel. Many of his toys end up in the tent with him and we always enjoy the disembodied sounds."
2,Just a manual,"Book is too basic. Majority covers very basic program functionality that is already present in the help - if you need pretty pictures that tell you when to press the 'next' button or 'ok' button then this book is for you. If on the other hand you already know how to enter a deposit and know how to reconcile your account, I suggest you try another book."
2,Shallow and inacurate misrepresentations and interpretations,"I'm sorry but referencing Rumi? I don't think you ever even read it. Judging from the interpretation that this silly Aesop fable has anything at all to do with of - The Mouse and The Frog, Rumi's Mathnawi , the author completely misses the point and takes a very lazy view of the meaning of this great poetic work. The Mouse and The Frog is a powerful LOVE STORY not a tale of ~revenge presented by this author. READ THE ORIGINALS YOURSELVES, PEOPLE!"
