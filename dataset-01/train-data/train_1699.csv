2,two out of three,"Two of the movies worked well, the other was pretty tore up. Unable to watch about ten minutes of that movie."
4,The Mummy DVD,"As always, the DVD came in within a few days of placing the order. I love the 1st movie, not so much the 2nd, but the 3rd is worth watching The Rock run around without a shirt! It was worth getting the boxed set; cheaper than getting the movies separately or just the 1st movie alone."
5,I am Pleased with Amazon.com,"Everything I have ever reieved from Amazon.com, has been exactly what I expected, and in the condition that I was told. very Pleased! Thank You Amazon for saving me money!!"
3,Mummy Collector's Set,"The product is just what I wanted. Although the dvd's were in shrink wrap, the cover box looked used. Overall I'm pleased because I had no plan to keep the covering."
3,Great Entertainment,"We bought this boxed set for Christmas, because I had been a big fan of Brendan Frazier and loved the original Mummy movie. As I have now watched it many times, some of the quirks of the movie have started to get to me, like here is the couple who go looking for ancient treasure and they ALWAYS find it, and are able to open secret doors, and read the text fluently! Aside from that it is entertaining, and my children do enjoy it at their level. Part two The Mummy Returns is exciting with their son added to the maylay and more adventure. The Scorpien King is the third movie in this set, and I havent watched it yet, so I cannot comment. All in all this is a fairly good boxed set, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if possible....."
4,good collection,"I loved the mummy an d the mummys return, when i first got them, and couldent wait until they came out on dvd. that scorpion king is on is just a extra bouns. I allways wanted to see it, but I never got the chanse.now I own it instead."
2,what happen to the box?! (Only reviewing the box),"I bought this set for a gift on december. The box was a nice carton that opened in the middle, right where the amulet was. Inside you got another package containing the movies.I bouth again for my collection, and now what you get is a cheap paper wrapper for a plastic common box. The mummy has gone cheaper when it comes to package."
4,Set de colección la Momia,"Esta presentación de las peliculas la momia, la momia regresa y el rey escorpion viene en un solo estuche con sus tres peliculas, la pelicula la momia y la momia regresa viene con subtitulo en ingles solamante y el lenaguaje viene en ingles y frances, el rey escorpion viene con subtitulos en español y presenta los mismo lenguajes que las dos anteriores. La region de los dvds es 1. Todas presentan un menu interactivo en donde se ven escenas, sonido, etc."
4,"The Movies I love , but the boxset.............no so great","I love the Mummy and the Mummy returns. It has always been a favourite of mine but when i recieve it. It was Okay. The boxset was so cheap made. If the Box was made better, it would've been Okay. No wonder it was so cheap.The Mummy is a collecter's edition with heaps of special features. I liked that about it, I do reccommend it to people that don't care how the boxset looks. but love the Movies.Overall, I loved the movies at a great price."
2,Don't count on the escape artist for an escape from smoke,It might have been nice to note that the directions indicate it is not to be used for escape from fire or smoke.
3,"A little fun , a little intrique,","This series continues to be an enigma. The beginings are very good.Annabelle and Dave could be much more likeable.Are they business executives,brainy partners,or sexy buddies?Annabelles beauty continues to be emphasized,Dave remains eccentric. I enjoyed the references to Hemmingway and the mystery that story revovles around.I didn't like the misspelled reference to the town of Annapolis.I was so tired of the references to the sunset in the Key West,that I became very thankful that I live in the pacific northwest.The characters,the Florida setting,are sometimes fun and sometimes annoying.I will probably read more in this series to see if Annabelle and Dave become more human."
3,I looked high and low for origin of manufacturer,"I researched carefully and I can only conclude that the maker of this espresso machine (stovetop) wants to give the impression that it is a German-designed including manufactured, product. When I received the espresso maker, in print so fine as to need a magnifying glass, is the disclosure: made in China. This item is therefore not befitting it's price and is not a clear advantage to use due to it's technology and quality (as is the impression given). It has been my experience that stainless steel from China or Korea is of poor quality and will in short time stain. Having held this in my hand, I do not find it remarkable. I have ordered in it's stead, a stovetop espresso maker that still offers 18/10 stainless steel quality, a noted reputable manufacturing company (with origin) at a fair cost."
4,electrical terminator - sleeve crimper tool,"Works well for its' intended use. The handles are a short for adequate leverage advantage, it requires a strong hand, or even a double grip to fully compress the crimping action. Crimping sleeves and insulating caps may be a bit difficult to find, and expensive per piece. For long term terminations they are great."
4,Specifications met,"The crimping tool is new and operates as expected. It came with minimal instructions. It is made with durable materials and I anticipate it will last many years. For someone unfamiliar with the crimper's operation the instructions may be inadequate. In addition the appropriate lugs and splice caps maybe difficult to correlate. For example the crimp tool is made by Buchanan, however the commonly available crimp sleeves you can obtain are made by Ideal industries. The Ideal numbers are not referenced in the crimp tool instructions."
4,Idiot proof,I use the normal plier crimp most of the time because its hard to get the crimp inside the box with this tool. However if there is enough space outside the box this tool makes a great soild crimp and looks/feels stronger than with the pliers
5,Buchanan C-24,"I put the C-24 to work just minutes after opening them. The Best, most reliable name for crimp slices! Thanks"
5,Best Book Yet,Out of the 12 books I have gotten about homeschooling this one was the BEST! The layout is wonderful and it has really great ideas for getting started and remaining afloat! A wonderful resource!
3,Good refrense book,"I think this book answers all your needs. Questions about laws, teaching styles and relatives. Listen, I think they went into the teaching styles to in depth, to the point of killing you. But overall, it is full of little useful tips. Even a section for teens at the end."
4,So true!,"This was a cute book and a nice short read. It took less than an hour to read, so don't expect to take this on a long flight and have it keep you occupied. I work at an airport and know how true this is! The stories we all could tell....I passed this on to my other airline friends who appreciated the humor."
5,READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO BE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"Hey, I'm a flight attendant for a major carrier and the author of FLYING BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS: FLIGHT ATTENDANT ADVENTURES ON A WING AND A PRAYER and I thought this book was darling and basically speaks the inside lanquage of what really frustrates Flight Attendants. Also very humorous!"
1,Low value DVD,DVD shows a lot the same images and there are no visits to remaining castles in the world or so. Its the whole time narrating with few asthonishing images.
3,The Repeat,"Its a fairly good documentary with different pictures and new video. BAD NEWS -It will make you smarter, but it will take all day. It was made for TV, so after every little ""break"" they re-interate all the stuff from the previous break. If they kept the repeating out, this would probably be a 1hr movie and not 2 hours. GOOD NEWS - If your a teacher and using this, repetition is key in helping students retain informaion."
2,not much new here if anything,"I became interested in the Templars after reading Foucault's Pendulum be Umberto Eco.I've since read or listened to it at least 10 times,always finding something new.I bought this DVD in hopes of learning some new things not in the book. It's too bad,there was not much if anything i hadn't learned from Mr Eco.And I must also say the staged battles were terrible. Almost comedic.I can't recommend this DVD to anyone with any knowledge of the Templars.Read Foucault's pendulm and learn a lot more than just about the Knights of Christ"
4,A nice piece of history,"This book was a handbook for discovering, torturing and executing witches. Its a nice piece of history, and will serve as a reminder of the horrors man is capable of."
2,"A ""Historical"" book about witchcraft accusations","Well, this is susposedly one of 2 works by Christian priests on how to be a Witch hunter. This is basically what started the killing of witches when the Chirtian church started to become the prominent religion around the world. They had to force their religion onto the common folks by killing them if they would not comform. I read this in disgust but i had to remind myself that back then, this is how the Christians tried to make people join their religion. Most of the accounts retold in this book made me laugh and some made me cry to think of how our ancestors were tortureed because of the stupidity of each other. You also have to ask yourself how accurate are these stories."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Wow, I saw this little book at Dollar Tree and thought why not, for $1. I shouldn't have wasted my money. Pretty much every poem has ""breathe, breathe, breathe"" in it. Oh, here's a hallmark, it's called ""Rushing Teaching Us to Slow Down"" and it goes like this:Oooh, I stubbed my toeOooh, I stubbed my toe againI mean seriously, come on. What is there to meditate about in that? Be careful not to stub your toe??? My 8 year old daughter could have written a better book. This book isn't even good enough to be re-gifted! Too bad it's ending up in the trash. The pictures crack me up, especially ""dots"" on the last page which is a bunch of ink dots that form a circle. The pictures (which Marell did himself) are simple line drawings that a 4 or 5 year old would do. I really do not understand what people see in this."
1,Skip this one.,"Pros-Price is nearly as as good as it gets.-it does work, sort of.-plug and play, even with Linux.-Some of the Special keys actually work with LinuxCons-Cheaply made (Most cheaply made mouse and keyboard I have ever used)-keys feel ""soft""-backspace key is very small-The Mouse will not work if further than 1.5' away from receiver.-Lag sometimes in communication between mouse and keyboard and computer.-Ink on keys poorly done, and hard to see.-Sounds terrible in use, like a loose spring rattling around in a ball point pen.-Description says 4 AA batteries required, you need two AAA and two AA.Overall, you will likely be happier with a used mouse/keyboard for the same price, or better yet, spend a little more cash up front, and get a decent product."
1,"Junk, lowest quality keyboard/mouse I ever bought","I bought this because I got a good price -- $15 for wireless keyboard/mouse combo. Believe me, this is not worth even $5.Keyboard shift keys are hard to press and stick. The rest of the keys are also very poorly designed. I type about 70wpm. With this keyboard, I average just over 20wmp.Mouse works if it is within 6 inches of the receiver. Anything past 6 inches causes a lag or no response.Cannot recycle so here goes more plastic to get buried in the ground at the local dump.On the plus side, I was able to use the batteries in another keyboard and mouse."
1,terrible,Types fine but has to be unplugged/plugged in everytime system starts!!!!why have a wireless keyboard if u have to plug in the usb cable each time u boot your system. Really stupid!!!!!
2,Cheap,"Does the job, but not good quality. This is the second set of wireless mouse and keyboards that has an issue with making batteries leak"
4,"Captivating, historical & engaging - Agreat read!",It takes the first third of the novel to understand how this woman/child develops her innate sensual beauty into a weapon. The remaining two-thirds are spellbinding as she meets challenge after challenge including the terror of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Survival at this time in California is not for the weak or the meek. She is neither. The methods she uses to advance her cause leave one both disturbed and fascinated.
4,Great external TV tuner,"I bought this tuner for a old crt monitor that was sitting around. It has a descent picture quality and can accept inputs from many different sources such as component, composite, s-video etc. The build quality seemed very good also. However, the sound from the build-in speaker is poor. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product."
4,"Good replacement of my broken TV, satisfied","My TV broke somehow and since my LCD monitor is good enough, I purchased this TVbox after I read all the other reviews about it. Up till now, I am pretty satisfied with it. Although the sound coming out of the TV box is really not good as the other reviewers mentioned, it improved a lot by just hooking speakers to the tvbox. I will recommend this TV box should anybody ask me."
3,why the poor picture?,"I bought a new widescreen 22 inch monitor to use with this. Why is the picture so much fuzzier than my cheap LCD TV (one or the worse hdtv's ever)? Perhaps I should not expect more but I'm wondering if anyone has figured out how to get a decent picture from a nice sized monitor? The resolutions for new widescreen monitors go to 1680x1050 but this box goes nowhere near that, and even at it's highest it's just a poor old color TV as far as I can tell (with standard cable).Any ideas?It took a few hours of fiddling, to get the color and other video controls as good as I could get them.Some controls like sharpness do absolutely nothing.Also what is common mode? you have to use the difficult menu to set that mode to use the PS2 game system, then the channels are very weird. (some weird channel mapping) then switch back to ntsc mode to get the cable channels back. A really big pain.todd."
3,Leave a little to be desired,"I bought this product after ditching my satellite TV service and because my LCD TV does not have built in TV tuner. I was surprised how few choices for under $100 there were.This device is very multi-use and can be setup a wide variety of configurations. However, the product could use some refinement and lacks quality. The remote control is cheap and for some reason the numbers do not follow the customary layout (3 per line) which is a pain. Also i have an issue with the vertical and the channel jumping, not all the time but enough to make it annoying. It is hooked up using VGA so maybe i need to play with a different config.I like this product because without it I can't watch basic cable TV and I can use it with many of my other electronic devices such as a regular computer monitor but I can't help be disappointed with the build quality of the unit."
4,it works,"This thing works....Period. You hook up your cable connection and then you can view all the cable stations, with out a cable box, that are on your standard cable package. NNNIIIICCCEEE. Now i don't have to let my monitor collect dust. If you like your sound to be robust than you will need speakers. I just used my old computer speakers."
4,Very good product,"The tv box works nicely, image quality could not be better.I recommend this product!P.S: I'm using it in Brazil, no problems at all with color system here."
3,Picture okay - Speaker Bad,"I hooked this tuner up to a 15 inch lcd computer monitor. This monitor is used only as a television in the kitchen. I do not have any computer components hooked up to it. It came with the wires necessary to turn a computer monitor into a tv. The picture quality is average; not nearly as good as an lcd television. The speaker is completely unacceptable. It is so ""tinny,"" it was intolerable. I didn't expect much, but the sound was almost painful. I ordered Logitech R-10 Speakers for $16.88 from Amazon. They make a huge difference. I would recommend buying a less expensive tuner w/o speakers and add speakers."
5,Amazing product,"This is a really amazing product, you can watch tv, dvd or play videogame (xbox, ps2, etc) and work with your computer at the same time using the PIP function. It does support several color systems, also PAL-M here in Brazil, all resolutions until 1280x1024 and 1440x900 resolution of widescreen monitors. It worths the price."
1,"Not only useless, but also really heavy","My favorite picture in the book is an amorphous blob with the word `potato' written next to it. Maybe I'm missing something, but if you need the words to explain what the picture is, what's the picture for exactly? Also, good idea making it too big to fit even in a coat pocket and too heavy to take anywhere.The `Point it' book by contrast is very small and has lots of photos. You could easily use it to order a Bombay martini anywhere in the world, which is the standard that should be used to evaluate a picture dictionary."
2,more like a pamphlet,"This ""book"" was very disappointing and more like a little pamphlet. Definitely not worth the cost, much less the shipping. (Fortunately, I had also ordered a different book that came with two Chinese jump ropes that was ten times better, and my Granddaughter was thrilled."
3,This is a thinner book than I realized!,"I'm not sure it's worth $5 in shipping and handling!The Chinese Jump Rope games are different from what I learned growing up - although unlike the Klutz book they mention reciting the jumps as you do them - which is what I wanted. I was disappointed, though, to see that a few of them were VERY similar to each other. If two jumps are the same except that in one you start outside the ropes and in the other you start inside, it seems like cheating to count them as separate instead of just as two variations on the same one."
1,Don't buy it,"This book is absolutely like another reviewer had said...""just like a pamphlet and NOT Worth the money"" I am absolutely disappointed in myself for not reading the reviews on this first before ordering. What a SCAM! And in order to return it and get your money back you have to have shipping deducted from your refund. Totally not right. I would highly recommend not ordering this item or you will wish you hadn't."
2,Too small for the price,"I couldn't believe that this book was nothing more than a pamphlet and cost so much. It should have been thrown in with the Chinese rope and everything would be good price. Although my granddaughter loved it, I felt like I was ripped off."
5,recent purchase,"everything came as advertised. good service. i tried local for these products, but could not find them....spent too much time & gas money looking. now my new gutters and drains are clog-free..thanks."
3,Very brief coverage of too many translations!,"This short (114 pp) book provides a very brief overview of 166 (I counted them) translations of the Bible or New Testament, starting with Wycliffe and ending in 1991. As you can see, this limits the coverage of most versions to a short paragraph. Many of the versions covered are quite obscure, and not to be found outside of the rare books collections of major libraries. So if you want to know about Samuel Palmer's translation of the New Testament in 1765, get this book. Otherwise, if you want a more in-depth treatment of versions you are likely to find at the bookstore, along with a good short introduction to issues like text criticism and priciples of translation, I suggest ""Essential Guide to Bible Versions"", by Philip W. Comfort. Vance's book is not much help in actually choosing a Bible."
4,An 11 year olds view,"This summer my parents decided my grammar needed ""help"". Therefore my father bought this book off of EBay for me. Even though I would rather be doing other things this summer, this book is extremely helpful yet boring. There are 6 parts to this book each of these parts explore different parts of the English language. One of the advantages to this book is that they list exercises after each section so you are able to practice what they teach."
2,not happy,"i order those shoes because they matched the dress perfectly, then the shoes arrived, they were brown. nothing like the picture on the site."
4,This is a solid case!,"This is a quality case that works for me, but I should have measured better prior to ordering it. I really needed the 12U top, 10U side, but was able to make it work with some ingenuity."
2,"Encouraging, but Not Helpful","If you're a new author looking for some encouragement, the stories in this book may offer it. Forty authors share their stories and struggles to success, and there may be hope there for others to recognize their situations are not unique.If you're looking for real, helpful information on how to get published this isn't it. Set up as a collection of invidual stories, there's no clear or cohesive instruction on anything. There's no review of the efficiency or effectiveness of the various roads the writers describe taking; while they may tell you that they did something wrong or made mistakes to learn from they don't lay out what new authors should know, do or be prepared for. In addition, much of this material is outdated to the point where relying on it could prove a handicap.I highly recommend The Street Smart Writer by Jenna Glatzer instead for anyone looking for information on getting published."
1,INADEQUATE VIBRATION,"I can't hear a sound alarm. The vibration alarm on this watch is too faint to detect under most circumstances. Therefore, do no buy it."
1,Nice house- nobody home,"This looked like a reasonably priced, fashonable watch. The wristband was large enough to fit my wrist, which is not always the case with these Asian imports. It looks nice and has a nice heft.HOWEVER, if you wear you watch on your left wrist like most right-handed people, you will find the ""alarm on"" stem pushes in every time you twist your wrist in to the right. I wanted an hourly alarm, and now I find myself remembering to check to see if the alarm turned itself off. Usually it has. The alarm-on stem should have been positioned above the time-set stem.Do NOT buy this if you are right-handed and need an alarm function as the alarm will most likely shut itself off while you are wearing it."
2,Caveat Emptor,"One of the knobs fell off, after a year of light use.Generally I really like the rotating bezel, indiglo, and alarm features. Plus I thought it was decent-looking. But now I wonder about quality. Do you get what you pay for?"
1,Watch did not work - 0 star,"I bought this watch as a gift and delivered it to my friend in Mexico. Later I was informed that the watch was taken to a jeweler because it didn't work. The jeweler told my friend that the watch was faulty.When I was told of this mishap, I suggested they toss the item as they had no way of returning it to me due to Mexico's mailing restrictions.It really made me angry to know that my gift did not work, plus my friend had the added expense of taking it to a jeweler that confirmed it was not repairable."
1,Timex mens's vibrating alarm watch #T41731,I am a light sleeper and get up to go to gym at 5 AM using alarm which unfortunately wakes my wife. I read the reviews before I bought the watch. Since money was not my major concern I decided to buy this watch for convience and not to have irrate wife or sleep in another room. The vibration is not good enough to wake you up and on some days it does not work. Additionally I am right hand user and the alarm just gets shut off during sleep. As such I have gone back to my faithful alarm but have decided to sleep in guest room to save myself from a irrate wife. Will not recommend this buy.
1,Look elsewhere,"Developed a leak in the watch face after 6months of regular use (occasional swimming, never worn in the shower). Even at $40 it's not worth it."
3,A decent watch,"If you want to buy me a gift for christmas, don't get me a wristwatch. Not because I don't like wristwatches, I love them. I'm just extremely picky about the right kind of watch. When it comes to watches, I'm a tough customer. Why? A good watch is something that's ALWAYS on your person! A good watch should last 3-5 years on average. Additionally, I want a wrist watch that has a vibrating alarm, chronometer, compass and ideally a temperature gauge as well ALL in analog! That said, this watch is a decent product. I only give it three stars because it lacks the other features I crave for a watch, but for it's vibrating features it's decent. The alarm could be a bit stronger, but adding the kinesthetic alarm feature to a wristwatch is pretty cool. The timex brand is solid as well."
2,Don't get wet,"Watch worked great until I took it whitewater rafting. Didn't go deeper than 5 feet (far from the 100 meters)in the water swimming in a gentle pool. Somehow water got in. Now, the watch does not keep time and has an inconsistant alarm. Looking for a new watch."
2,"great watch, can barely feel the vibration","This is a 5 star watch as a meditation timer and it's handsome, tough, and easy to set. But for more worldly applications, I doubt you'll be able to feel the alarm going off as it's very subtle. Go with an easy set audio alarm."
4,Vibrating Watch,"This is my third Timex watch and probably the best yet. I like the easy way to set the alarm, and the vibration is sufficient for my needs. Do not buy if you want the vibration for a set alarm clock feature. (You will sleep through it!) It's really good for alerting you for set appointments during the day time."
2,Superb concept; poor reliability,"I've owned this watch for a year now. The alarm is super easy to set -- just rotate the outer bezel and pull the knob. I use it all the time -- for timing the coffee pot or reminding myself to make a phone call in a few minutes. The vibration alerts me when I can't hear the high pitched alarm from some other watches. But after just 8 months, the knob that sets the alarm pulled out completely. I sent it in for repair and the watch was returned in a couple of weeks. Now, just a week ago -- just after the watch went off warranty -- it happened again. I love the ease of use, but I can't recommend the durability of this watch."
3,"Nice looking, but a little bulky.","This is an extremely nice looking watch with easy functions to learn and operate, however, after wearing it on my wrist, I think my left arm is now slightly longer than my right...just joking. But seriously, it is a little on the heavy/bulky side - I hope I can get use to it."
5,Good fitting and well made,These went on the car without a hitch and had no runout. Excellent quality at an excellent price.
2,Kind of basic,"Really basic compared to the other balance ball dvd's that I have. If you have never used an exercise ball before, this would be a good place to start."
1,BORING!!!,"This has to be the absolute most boring workout ever. Thank goodness I rented instead of bought. This workout is for someone who has never worked out in their life.... very easy, even if you haven't worked out lately. I would not, not, NOT recommend this to anyone looking to really sweat."
2,Incredibly Boring,"I can't believe this workout got such great reviews. I've been doing theQuick Fix: Stability Ball Workoutfor months and decided to get another workout to add to the mix. I couldn't even make it through the whole workout. Not because it was too hard, but because it was so slow moving. I was bored within the first couple of minutes! Half of the exercises weren't hard at all and the pauses between each set were a bit irritating. There's no music and to be honest it looks like Emily Passic is doing this video as a project for a college class or something. Definitely not professional quality. A total waste of money."
4,5-stars if it hadn't gotten repetitive toward the end,"The first half to 3/4 of this little book is fascinating, describing how each of these individuals came to realize they had special gifts and that they were capable of helping to bring about God's healing.They were born worlds apart, but upon meeting, quickly fell in love and began to work together to facilitate the healing of as many as sought them out. Neither ever accepted payment in any form. Each understood himself to be, not a healer, but a channel for God's healing.If you have any interest in spiritual healing, or want to understand what is meant by ""spiritual healing"", this is the book for you. In addition, if you have an interest in out-of-body experiences not associated with death, this book would be helpful.Along the way, you'll be reading a beautiful love story."
1,Birthday Banner,Banner made great decoration for my god son's first birthday party..... Worth the money... The above ratings does not have anything to do with the quality... I just don't think that this is a toy... but it's great decoration
2,You don't pay much and that's about what you receive.,"I was expecting much more detailed info on the camera. The nuts and bolts the tricks, special feature. The DVD's similar in content to the those ""Short Course"" books on camera's. I did pick-up a thing or two - I was expecting more. The best idea was suggesting you print out the PDF manual from Canon so you can study the manual without eye strain. Neat idea!I'm not new to digital cameras. Was I expecting too much? Probably not. For nick-the-new-guy to the 20D it probably worth the money but not individuals familar to other digital SLRs.I do recommend you print out your manual and go over it page by with the camera in your hands!"
4,Not your average Western Tale!,"A truely wonderful yarn that was impossible to put down. Like Jack Crabb of ""Little Big Man"" fame and ""Forrest Gump"" a entertaining telling of the push towards the western frontier and the characters and events that such a wild time produced. I was given this book as part of a birthday present, afterwards when asked what I thought my first response was.... I imagine that....had I actually met Billy somewhere, sat down with him and let him relate this story, my first response might have been ""That had to be the biggest lie I ever heard"". her response ""Well, why did you continue to listen to him then"", grinning my response to her was ""He told it so well""!"
2,Car charger does NOT work with BlackBerry,"I bought this for my wife's car, which I usually use on the weekends. She has an iPhone, I have a BlackBerry, so I wanted to minimize charger clutter in the car. While it works fine with her iPhone 3Gs, it does NOT work with my BlackBerry 9800. A message pops up on the BlackBerry saying that the connected charger is insufficient to power the device.So much for the ""universal"" part, although I have long ago learned not to trust the title descriptions on Amazon.Oddly enough, the AC outlet charger does work with my BB. But if you are buying this primarily for use in the car, be forewarned: the iPhone, yes; BlackBerry, no."
5,"Work great, very handy.","Prompt delivery. Now I don't have to plug into my laptop USB to charge, I can just find an empty outlet around the house, or in the car if we're driving. These work great!"
4,Well made product,I think these look great in my office. Nice sleek and practical. Cost is my only complaint. You have to buy them separately. It didn't stop me from buying 8 trays. and using them in different configurations as needed. Just saying all in all they should cost less. (I had to drop a star for cost)
4,Electric power substations engineering,"I bought this book because I found drafting job in electric company. My previous knowledge about substations was less than general, so I have to learn this stuff. This book helped me to learn everithing I need. It is detailed and easy to understad. Good thing is that author show schematicaly some segments of substation and because of that it is much easier to understand it's purpose."
2,Alot of general info but not much specific,"Book gives a broad overview of substations, but not very detailed. If you have anything more than a passing interesting how substations work this book will not be much use to you. I started a new job as a commisioner and this book was of little benefit to me. Not enough details on the inner workings of power protection and switchgear."
5,A Wonderful Cultural Experience!,"I bought this book for my husband to read to our baby, he is a Kenyan and a Kalengin. We both instantly feel in love with the book and can't wait to read it to our little girl and future children. It is a great book for anyone wanting to learn about a wonderful place!"
2,Incorrect swahili spelling and words aaargggh,"This book was a gift to our 5 year old bilingual girl by a Swedish friend. Each time our daughter asks me to read this book, I'm very disappointed by the very incorrect spelling and use of Swahili words. Some words have a direct translation as (maziwa lala - sleeping milk!! what on earth is sleeping milk????? It should be cultured milk/sour milk. Una taka chepati? This spelling is completely wrong - Una taka (unataka is one word! not two) and Chepati=chapati.It is not a pancake!Almost all the swahili words in this book are spelt wrong. Why didn't she do some research or even better, get a Swahili speaker to proof read this book? It is so annoying to read, but I have to do it for my daughter when she asks for it. I wouldn't buy it.:-("
5,COOL,"I think that Into the Fire is a book that brings together action, fiction, and a bit of romance. Tip and Beau return in the sequal to Into the Forge. As Tip and Beau become seperated form their friends they incounter many dangers, and in them also many havens and friendly people.I recomend this book to anyone who likes Lord of the Rings, or something of the sort.Anyone reading this will notice simularities to Lord of the Rings and some may not like it because it relates to much.This book, I reccomend, to anyone above the age of thirteen and up, and to both male and female audiences, although males may like it more."
2,What's the plot?,"I found this second book of Dennis's to be very lacking, which moved me to write this review. The excellent storylines found in his previous work is nonexistant here in this duology. The characters are shake-and-bake ""hobbits"" with flat personalities. There is no realism in the characters, either. No personality conflicts, no passion, just a sugary goodness that is hard to believe. The badguys are always off-camera, except for the seemingly endless battle scenes that are boring because they are the same each time: the goodguys always lose troops, but never ""key"" goodguys, and the enemy is always *cleverly* outsmarted. The second book is bereft of plot, as well. Halfway through the book, the Silver Sword is mentioned in the hands of an unknown character, Galarun, who is promtly killed. This book went to the printer as a first draft, and I hope the quality of McKieran's future releases makes it over the bar instead of doing the limbo. One last thought on this book: ""Barn rats!"""
5,Great Twists,Dennis McKiernan has never disappointed over the years as I have kept up with his books from the beginning. Into the Fire does not disappoint. This tale envelopes the reader and carries them through the journey with the characters. Lots of suspense right up to the very end. This duology is a must read for any Tolkien fanatic.
3,Too Many Characters,"I have read almost every one of McKiernan's books and this was the most hard to read through. After reading his other novels, I've become tired of his stories centering around warrows, which is a minus. The only other problem with this book is that so many characters were met by the main two warrows that when you see that some of them have died you wonder who they were. By allowing Beau and Tip to have adventures around most of the world of Mithgar, it is near impossible to care for any of the people that the two warrows meet. However, if you enjoyed Into the Forge, you won't be disappointed by the ending in Into the Fire."
3,Disappointing,"I've really enjoyed McKiernan's work, but this book felt forced as if he lost interest in it about halfway through. The book could have easily been 150 pages shorter."
2,Into the Repetition (Part 2),"This book was hard for me to read. I've reviewed the first one of this duology, and the same problems exist for this book. It is too repetitive, chiefly in the areas of travel and philosophy. There is no reason for these novels to be this long. Such a waste., and I was able to finish it."
4,Never disappointed!,"As a long time McKiernan fan, I briefly strayed for some years but found my way back and was not disappointed. I couldn't put the book down and cannot wait until the last book is on the shelves! By the way when will that be?"
3,"Great characters, who deserve a better book","Dennis McKiernan has a talent for creating likable characters who catch your interest and make you care for them. He has done that in this book. Unfortunately, he takes them nowhere, very slowly. I read fantasy for escapism. When it reads more like an essay on the dichotomy between good and evil, it is time to re-think the basic premises. Introspection and soul-searchng are wonderful, character-developing tools. Mr. McKiernan has mis-used them, and sold out; he could have written a much bettter book in one volume, but sold out for the bucks. This leaves me on the horns of a dilemma; do I just ignore the next volume (Into the Fire), or take a chance that he got it together and go on? I probably will read the next book, but I will reserve judgement. . . ."
2,my review,"everything with the seller went great. i am a little disapointed because this book has pages from the other I Spy books which my son already has. I thought it would be different and really "" a Challenger!"" -- NOT! So basically I spent money on something we already had."
5,A great book!,This is a book of kids' games. It was really fun to play with. The whole book was very hard to do. I had fun with the book.
5,Favorite Volume So far,"As per usual, Ishtar and Duzzell are getting into trouble. This time, they are going undercover as a traveling knight (Ishta) and his brother/sister (Du) in order to find Phelios' heir in Ci Xeneth. Lots of ""Darres is mad"" scenes and also quite a bit of involvement from Prince Vord, whom I'm starting to like more than I thought I would, going just on his meat-head appearance and love of fighting. (He scores 100% on Yu Jinn's magic exam whereas Ishtar scores only 27!) And of course, lots of magical mishaps, and some off color jokes, reign."
4,"Best for beginners, not for those already familiar with Aftel's work","I am a fan of Aftel's work, and I would recommend this for the person casually interested in making solid perfume. This small book -- it's about the size of a CD case -- contains a brief history of solid perfumes, an overview of top/middle/base notes, and easy-to-follow instructions. It's also packed with some beautiful photographs of Aftel's studio and various vessels, such as the shells of pocket watches, used to carry solid perfumes. For beginners, I would give this 4 stars.For those already familiar with her work, I would give this 3 stars. 90% of the material in the book has already been covered in Aftel's other works, the excellent ESSENCE & ALCHEMY and AROMA. If you have the former, there really is no reason to get this book unless you are a completist or enjoy the photographs."
4,Mr. Spellbound,I enjoyed this cd! It is a must have for all Vandellas fan! Martha really shows off her skills! I recommend this to anyone who is a motwn fan!
4,Peruvian Salsa with Cuban flavor,"I bought this CD for my stepfather who is from Peru. Everytime I play the songs, it takes him back to his ""hey-days"". Great salsa songs from the past.Compre este CD para mi padrastro que es de Peru. Siempre que pongo las canciones, lo hace recordar de su juventud.Buena salsa del pasado."
5,This is a fabulous CD,"I bought this CD because I like Bette. One play and I was hookedI listen to it over and over. I especially like the songs with Barry Manilow and the duet ""Sisters"" with Linda Ronstadt."
4,She's in fine voice and the arrangements are often terrific,"But the CD is fairly brief. I would have liked a few more selections (I'd be very interested in a Midler ""Mangos"" and/or ""Blues in the Night""). The ""Sisters"" duet with Linda Ronstadt is fairly tepid--now that Liza Minnelli is back in shape, I'd like to see Bette team up with her for a duet and ""Sisters"" would have been a good choice.Aside from that, this is worth your money. It passes the test of improving with each listen. Best Bettes this time: a witty ""Hey There"", the amusing ""Slow Boat"" duet with Manilow, and rousing renditions of ""Mambo Italiano"" and ""In The Cool, Cool, Cool Of The Evening.""Those looking for camp versions of the Clooney canon should forget it--this is a highly respectful tribute."
4,Love these old songs,I have been seeing commercials for this CD and I couldn't wait to order it. I can't stop humming Mombo Italiano
5,BETTER BETTE,IT'S ABOUT TIME BETTE HAS GOTTEN BACK TO HER ROUTES. GIVING HER OWN FLAIR AND PERSONALITY TO OLD SONGS. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST BETTE ALBUM SINCE HER DIVINE MS. M DAYS. I WOULD GIVE THIS CD A 5 STAR REVIEW.
2,Only 31 Min. of Music - Columia Records rips-off fans again.,"This CD has only $7 worth of music on it.This is nothing against the Divine Miss M unless she had something to do with providing LESS THAN 31 minutes of music on this CD!!!What is here is in her classic style and well done, but I cannot help feeling RIPPED-OFF by it.I recommend you wait and buy it used, once 1000's of disappointed fans decide that 31 minutes of music isn't worth the effort to put the CD in the player.I was going to go to Ms. Middler's concert in Chicago, but I'm having second thoughts about it. I'd hate to go and spend $100+ and only get her singing for 45 minutes."
2,Don't bother...,"Unless they can put more than an LP's worth of music on a CD, it's not worth the bucks. Performance-wise, it's OK; I think you're better off with the original Rosemary."
1,What A Disappointment,"I'm a big fan of both Midler and Clooney, so I was especially disappointed at this bland, tedious rendition of Rosemary's songs. It had no pizazz at all! ""This Old House"" sounds like ""From A Distance"". If I hadn't read the liner notes I wouldn't have recognized that Bette was singing a duet with Linda Ronstadt. At first I was shocked that a CD in this day and age could be just 30 minutes in length, but I was actually relieved to get this awful CD over quickly."
3,Way too short,"The songs are good - but the styling wasn't the best - the songs didn't flow well at all - and the overall cd was so short - only about 30 minutes! However, Bette Midler's voice was great - and I thought she had an uncanny likeness to Rosemary Clooney."
2,Not what I expected,Seems to me this was made just for the money. It is only 30 minutes long! What a rip off.
2,Loose Lips Sink Ships,"What is the deal with the Divine Ms. M. lip-syncing on the Barry Manilow Christmas show, and on Jay Leno? Since she was promoting this album, one would have thought that Bette would at least sing something live from it. Overall I thought the album was fine - Mambo Italiano and Cool Evening are upbeat tracks, and my favourite selections. It's sad to say, but like so many people that were once unique, her time has come and gone. In my opinion, she's lost her edge - probably due to her trip down the easy listening adult contempo swamp. The lack of struggle shows in her music - no edge, no suffering, no credibility. Just another nice rich Jewish girl who sold out for the gold. Maybe she should ask her fans for forgiveness and tell us it was just temporary brain damage. For godssake,Bette, sing it live unless of course you have something to hide."
3,Bette's Trubute to Rosie,"Don't let my 3 star rating discourage you from purchasing this album. Actually, I loved it, BUT 30 minutes worth of music on a CD giving trubute to an outstanding artist like Rosemary Clooney who has recorded hundreds of wonderful songs during her long career is a total rip-off in my estimation.Oh, I've heard the excuses about artists being forced to fill up a CD with 45-60 minutes of music (15-20 minutes being junk) just to satisfy the public, but come on. We're talking about Rosemary Clooney, Bette Midler and Barry Manilow --- all outstanding artists. Recording another 20 minutes worth of Clooney music, especially some of the Nelson Riddle stuff would have made this extremely short album be an outstanding one."
5,Wonderful!,"A great CD. The song Bette sings with Barry Manilow, On a Slow Boat to China, is so fabulous that you'll want to play this CD over and over again!"
5,Love it!,"I grew up listening to my parents Rosemary Clooney albums so I am very familiar with her music and have always loved it. Bette Midler has a wonderful voice and in some of the songs sounded very much like Rosemary herself. I love how it is Ms. Clooney's music mixed with a bit of Ms. M's personality. I wish there were more songs on this CD. My favorites are ""This Old House"" and ""Mambo Italiano"". Another great job on arrangements by Barry Manilow! Please give us more!"
5,Bette just keeps getting better!,"When I heard Bette was recording a tribute to Rosemary Clloney, I cringed. Mainly because I have never heard Ms. Clooney and had an preconcieved idea of what her music was like. Well, I have still not heard Ms. Clooney's versions and after hearing Bette's interpretations, I won't. These songs ARE Bette!! She has made them all her own, most definately. Her voice is sounding better than ever on these eleven songs that are tailored made for her. She has done such a great job on this CD. It's flawless in every way. I would recommend this CD to any Bette fan. This woman knows how to make any song her own and older songs are her forte. Excellent!"
5,BETTE is in top form !,"Long time fans of MIDLER will truly love this CD based on the merit of the material and production. CLOONEY fans will appreciate the care and attention that MANILOW, MIDLER and friends bring to this project. These songs are pop classics and MIDLER manages to bring new life to the entire collection. BETTE's vocals are at their best !Ms.CLOONEY would be proud of Ms.MIDLER !This CD is an must have to add to any pop music collection !"
1,A Tribute to Midler's EGO,"This is Midler's worst cd since, Some People's Lives"". Bette is in love with FLUFFY mush and sentiment. Gone are the daring interpretations of the 70's and 80's. Now we have Bette, SLEEP WALKING her way thru pedestrian sylized numbers.What's next Bette? A TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE WELK?And, please: Do vocal excercizes before your next turn at bat. Stop the warbling!"
2,Why Bother?,"Three years since her last album, more than two since her cancelled TV series, & she has no more energy than to record 31 minutes of a huge songbook like Clooney's? I have been one of Midler's most stubborn supporters, through thick (Some People's Lives) & thin (Mud Will be Flung Tonight), since 1972 (even before the release of The Divine Miss M!), so you have to know it breaks my heart to say this: I just can't justify a full list price release that barely gets going before the project is over. Of course, I should consider Manilow as producer: the last time he produced her (1973), the result was barely 35 minutes."
2,"Perfectly pleasant, slightly dull","Bette Midler's new album paying tribute to Rosemary Clooney is perfect background music, the kind of pleasant CD to have on while you're doing other things. You know the material, and you've heard it sung with more expression and life by many others. But it's harmless enough, breaking absolutely no ground, with no strong point of view one way or another. Certainly not a must have, and an unfortunate continuation of the suburbanizing of the Divine Ms. M."
2,Bland Bette,"Miss M. and Mr. Manilow may have adored Rosie, but this tribute is all strictly white bread. The only interesting cut is her take on THIS OL' HOUSE, while the rest ooze on down into EZ Listening sludge. A very respectful paean to Ms. Clooney, but Bette is definitely not pushing her chops enough to make this album interesting. And the arrangements are occasionally overdone on this short, ultimately unsatisfying disc."
1,Skip this one...,"This is an obvious scheme to get Bette rich off the world's mourning Clooney's death. This is the ultimate insult to any Clooney fan, or jazz fan! What's worst is Manilow(& linda Ronstdat) is on here(he took advantage of Siantra's death, and did the same thing cut a horrible tribute cd, even worst than this one). Midler has talant and a lovely voice however the arrangements are dated and make fun at clooney, Clooney would have appreciated a tribute album I'm sure by a tasteful jazz Quartet, by a singer like Margaret Whiting, or Keely Smith(however those gals are too classy they'd wait a few years). Midler sounds as though she were a 4th rate Annie Ross, she has the balls that Ross has, but not the class! Well in any case, this cd is not good, it's overproduced. She adds a techno dance club DJ mix beat to Clooney's worst hit Come On A My House(Clooney always regretted singing that). Pass on this and buy one of Clooney's Concord releases, get the real thing."
3,"I was curious as to what Rosemary Clooney's songs were, as she was a little bit before my time.","I usually love Bette Midler's songs and styling. I also was always curious as to what Rosemary Clooney's songs were like.I was disappointed, as I found I didn't like the songs as much as I would have thought (given Clooney's reputation). I still liked Bette Midler's singing (of them)."
4,"Divine, almost.","Bette is almost perfect on this cd. Almost. It's enjoyable. I just wish I could sense her passion a little more. But it was close to Divine, oh so close. Good buy though."
3,Get Bette and Bublé - perfect together,I purchased the Michael Bublé disc and saw Bette's latest listed with it. Thanks to my first purchase I discovered how good Bette's was. She is 'Divine'..
5,Music Lover,"Bette and Barry back together again! They make great music together! Rosemary Clooney is smiling from heaven! Midler's voice provides the great range and emotional sentiment of Rosemary's songs. The duet with Linda Ronstadt for ""Sisters"" was outstanding and joyful. The production of the cd by Barry Manilow is genius! Bette and Barry were meant to make music together!Kimberly"
1,"Agree with Joan Crawford ""Jon"" reviewer","When I first saw this album, I thought instantly that I wanted it. Thank goodness for the Amazon Music Sampler! Too much synthesizer - this would have sounded great and more true to the era with an actual orchestra. I'm disappointed and will not be purchasing this one."
4,Love It!,"Easily Bette's best work in a decade. I have to join the general lament on the brevity of this recording. I can only hope Bette and Barry are planning a Part Two from the leftovers on this one. A few quibbles: The first cut, You'll Never Know (a favorite of mine) is tossed off far too casually and ends just as the song is getting started. Couldnt she at least have repeated the verse? And do we really need another recording of White Christmas? (by a Jewish girl?) Otherwise, I loved this. Hopefully this will jump start her career again. Its been in the doldrums far too long."
2,Too short and not sweet enough,"Personally I am tired of being ripped by record companys. Yes, the music is great and Bette has seldom sounded better. But at 31 minutes this is a rip. Rosemary Clooney had a half century career and surely they could have added a few more songs to this CD. Don't know about you but I paid 'full price' and got half a CD. Too bad. And people wonder why music sales are down."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it.
3,Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook,"I purchase Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook yesterday along with Whitney Houston's christmas album ""One Wish""...I love bette cd its good...And Whitney Houston's ""One Wish"" holiday album is amazing to both women does a amazing job. I would recommend both cds to anyone who love good music. Cause Whitney Houston's ""One Wish"" Will definately get into the holiday spirits."
2,You don't GET enough from BETTE!,"I had this CD on my wish list from the time it was announced for release. I got it for a birthday present and played it at the party immediately upon ripping the package open. This CD is so short! Surely, Rosie made many more wonderful songs that Bette could have sung. This CD is 30 minutes long. There is not enough enjoyment to make it work the price."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"This is a delightful combination of Bette Midler's vocal talent, Barry Manilow's arrangements and some wonderful songs. I would have liked a few more cuts as there were many more of Rosemary Clooney's hits to choose from. All in all, great listening."
5,Simply Divine!,"A singer who continues to grow emotionally as well as technically, Miss M brings to life some fabulous old songs as well as some tired old numbers I thought I'd never want to hear again (for example: ""Come On A My House""). Not just a wonderful homage to Rosie, but a lovely, lively set from one of our greates living singers."
2,Bette does Rosemary,"While I am a fan of Bette Midler, this CD didn't impress me. I did enjoy the duet with Barry Manilow."
1,If you're a Rosemary Fan - Don't Waste your money,"While Midler and Manilow are artists in their own right, they should stick to their own and not try to market a questionable product at the expense of Rosemary.No wonder Amazon does not provide a preview soundtrack of the album. Since Amazon won't refund after the CD's been heard, I used it for a Frisbee and it's history.The titles are the only thing that relates to Rosemary as the arrangements and vocals have no resemblance. Albeit one track, ""SISTERS"" I do consider a tribute and am thankful to Ronstadt for that.Midler does a great job. It's just in no way reminiscent of Rosie. I say stick with the real thing. No one can match Rosemary Clooney and I believe this CD is wrongfully capitalizing on Rosemary!"
1,Not worth the cash,"I bought this CD because it was the Divine Miss M, and was really disappointed in the arrangements by manilow. This CD is so bland. The arrangements are just plain boring. Shocking when you think of the music she has put out previously."
5,Thought provoking novel,"This novel was a quick read for me, it was a true page-turner. I did have a second read and found that there is more to this book then one may realize. You easily see Parvaiz's ability to indirectly discuss today's social issues. I would highly suggest a second read of this book. I looked for other books by Parvaiz and was astonished to find that this may be his first book published, absolutely outstanding. FIVE STARS!!!!!"
4,Great gift,"Its a nice painting to do. Took me about 4 months to complete it, working on it a few hours a week, but I did it, and the receipient really loved it. Turns out nice, but doesnt have the ""glow"" of a Thomas Kinkade. But it is good for the price!"
5,"Love Song--""Music & Memories""","If you are a fan of the pioneer Christian Contemporary Music group, ""Love Song"", then you will want to own this book! Not only does it contain all of the sheet music with lyrics from their first two studio albums, but it contains hard-to-find photo's and stories of their origin, from the drug-induced days of the 60's, to finding salvation in Jesus Christ at Chuck Smith's church, Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa (CA); sparking the Jesus Music Movement. Enjoy these songs and memories for years to come. You will be blessed over and over again!"
1,These Stink!,They crackled and peeled after the first washing. Very poor product. Only good for one time wear-iron-on shirts. Very disappointed.
4,Okay for what it is,I purchased these to make T-shirts for a movie showing. They printed great and was very easy to iron on. However after ONE washing the edges were coming up. I understand this is not the same as buying a T-shirt already printed...however I would think you could get at the very least two or three washings.
5,Marvelous performance in all respects,"I am not a big fan of baroque music, but the music of Leclair is a big exception. In a period dominated by the Italian School, Leclair is one of the more notable composer/performers (along with Marais) in the French tradition.Leclair also was essential, along with violinists like Tartini, in advancing the groundwork of violin technique in the first half of the 18th century. Much of the work accomplished in the Classical and Romantic periods used Leclair's technical developments as a starting point.With that in mind, this is a wonderful CD showcasing three of Leclair's sonatas for violin & basso continuo, including ""Le Tombeau,"" perhaps his most well-known sonata. You can't go wrong with Monica Huggett; she provides you with a spectacular performance on all three sonatas. A definite must for any baroque collection. Remember, not all baroque music was coming out of Italy and Germany! Remember the French."
2,missing the nails,There were no nails and no manual. I'm not sure if its supposed to come with nails but i tried to put it together and the legs are very loose so i assume nails are needed! very disappointed. Also the product wasnt packaged properly and when i got it some of the edges were broken!
3,I too felt a little mislead by size & content.,"I bought this book for my daughter, the mother of my 2yr old grandson. she has a spiritual side but does not go to church. I know that many of the Chicken Soup books have a Christian slant but this book does have an affiliation with the MOPS group and is therefore has a bigger religious slant than other Chicken Soups. I did not see the MOPS reference in the book description when I was ordering. I admit I did not read the entire 3 screens of description, feeling that having a number of these books of my own, I thought I knew what I was getting. I am still giving the book to my daughter in hopes that she is not turned off by the lack of ""non-religious"" stories. I am a Christian myself...but there is not a ""Jesus"" moment in every thing that happens to me. ALSO the book is smaller and flimsy-er than my other Chicken Soups. I don't know if that is because of the MOPS affiliation or what...but it is not of the quality I expected to be giving as a gift!"
5,"""The Race"" by Natalie Bright","I absolutely loved this book. Such fond mememories of rearing my own daughters; and what a treasure in Casey Bright's view of life. I agree totally ... fish crackers for everyone every day. The years between fish crackers and wedding cakes are very short indeed, plus every little boy should have a mom they want to marry! Every mom and granny should run out and get ""Chicken Soup Mother of Preschooler's Soul"". A winner!"
4,A must-read book.,A major book for the middle and top managers involved in the semiconductor business.In addition to an insight in the microelectronics history.
5,Great leadership Insights,"""Andrew has an exciting way to explain things. Bold, able to see and make decisions. While most executives are trianed to 'make' things successful and to 'fight' to win a losing proposition, Andrew made a very tough deicison which was to get out of one line of business and bet the entire company on another. Not many people could do that. He did and the success of Intel and the computer industry was the result."""
2,"Very superficial, expected more from the Master","I have great admiration for Andy Grove. His book gave an honest account of how Intel dealt with difficult situations. How they too can be indecisive at times and hedge their bets. However, I expected the Master to share with us his experience in a lot more depth. Many of the examples he gave can be obtained free from the web! Now that he is not full time Intel employee, he can perhaps give more explicit insight on his experience, dealing and thoughts about his peers, competitors, suppliers and customers. He was kind of reserve in the examples he gave, restricting only to bashing the Japanese. I look forward to the next book from Andy Grove"
2,Lengthy Writing,"I picked up this book after seeing some good reviews about it.The whole book is about ""Strategic Reflection Point"".I was disappointed that Andy Grove didn't try to explain SRP in a more concrete manner. After finishing the book, I still have very vague & abstract knowledge on SRP.Nevertheless, Andy Grove is still one of the best CEOs I admired."
2,overrated for sure,"This book could have been ONE chapter, but I guess that's hard to sell! I have no idea why this has such a high rating. It's repetitive, internally inconsistent, and so vague as to basically be a bunch of handwaving. If you want a hopelessly out-of-date book about a CEO patting himself on the back, go for it. Bonus- tons of boring anecdotes! (Gotta fill up the pages somehow!)"
2,Overrated and overblown,"Andy Grove helped to build Intel into the behemoth it has become. On the other hand, he didn't sell IBM on the X86 which was the critical moment nor resolve all the manufacturing processes they had in different fabs (Craig B's watch did that).This is a relatively short book and could be a lot shorter. Inflection points... yeah, I get it. Now, please move on Andy.If you are a high-tech sales or marketing executive and read books like this and are awed by them, you are the probably not the sharpest tool in the drawer."
5,Wonderful!,"Mr. Grove has done the world a great service by presenting this book for us to read. It is chock full of info that is applicable to any company that wishes to survive in this ever-changing world.Also recommend a related book focused on leadership that would also inspire you to achieve great feats: ""The Leader's Guide: 15 Essential Skills."""
2,Nothing new here,This is something that any first year business student could have written. It is a fast read but it provides no new insights.
3,Good content...a little hard to read.,This was a good book. A little to technical and difficult to read
5,Il miglior libro del mondo !,"Cari amici imprenditrori Italiani, leggete anche voi questo libro che sicuramente vi darà degli interessanti spunti per le vostre aziende.E state attenti .... la meteora prima o poi arriverà anche per Voi !!! Andrea Polo"
3,Don't expect too much,"If you are looking for a nice story, it could be a good choice. But, if you looking for a good book about change management, I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."
3,It is a development history book of Intel,"I think the book is good because you can be familiar with the development history of Intel. But if you think that you can learn many critical management techniques from this book, I think that you will feel disappointed. Overall, this book is valuable to read."
3,"Relevant, but dated messaging","I had wanted to read this book for some time because I was intrigued by the title. This book does provided some good insight into how to anticipate and manage the natural boom-bust cycles that affect all businesses. However, the stories about the emergence of GUI based computing and the Internet, as examples of strategic inflection points for Intel, were not particularly enlightening for me. I suppose the material is too familiar given my background in the tech industry and as an investor in Intel.I was more interested in Grove's exploration of the internal organizational dynamics that can accompany strategic change and chaos. His insights into the challenges of keeping focused, leading by strategic actions (vs. plans) and balancing the competing dangers of too much focus vs. too much hedging thru periods of crisis were particularly relevant."
2,Not another paradigm shift book,"I enjoyed the inside perspective on Intel that Andy provides and agree with the basic premise of the book. But its the same old paradigm shift stuff just repackaged under a different name - strategic inflection point.If you haven't read much on paradigm shifts then you should read this book. But if you have, you'll probably find it boring."
2,Only for business managers?,"Contrary to popular opinion on this website, I found this book to be boring, repetitive and badly written. It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types."
4,Using the Internet to Problem Solve,"Thgs excellent book, combines the best new tool from technology with the best educational methods.Best of all the authors are teachers who pracitce what they preach, the best of all world in a professional development setting. This family affair effort gets high marks from central Indiana teachers and trainers."
4,Russkies,"Very fun old B movie. I was an extra in this movie so I am biased. Too bad there are no special features but with Leaf Phoenix who is now known as Joaquin and little Peter Billingsley, it is a must have to your collection."
3,Good Kit,"It is a good kit, but the little metal plate you can get engraved is cheap. I bought it because it came with a metal plate and I think I am going to get something better engraved and mount it."
2,Poor Print copies,"When I first showed this in my World Literature class, it skipped through-out. I changed dvd players, but no change. I returned the product and ordered a replacement. Sadly, the replacement skips in the same places. I assume the whole lot is defective, but I could be wrong. I apologize to my students beforehand for the irritation. It IS a nice overview. I just wish I could get a decent copy. A VHS copy would be nice, but it isn't listed on the History Channel's website."
5,One of the Best Series to READ.,"I have read the whole series. This is the first graphic novel in the series. It starts you off with a fun rollercoaster ride with reality saving Marvel characters. The stories through out the series are well developed and are a fun read. They remain true with their continuity and sub-plots through out the storylines. And it gets complex. Enjoy. :)P.s. If you can remember the ""What If"" series that Marvel had out a very very long time ago. This series adds a 3rd degree to it, it accomlishes that same answer to a lot of those ""what if's"" and then gives it an ongoing reality. What If's like what would happen if the Brood survived or if the legacy virus mutated or this villain took over or if this person wasn't exposed to gamma rays . . . or whatever . . . and then it answers those questions and keeps those stories alive and mixes in all the other realities to create a whole universe of ongoing answered what if questions with their own specific and weird reality. :)"
1,srpastor,Even though it is bought through Amazon doe NOT make it a product you want...damaged...return not accept. Nor any correspondence to assit.
5,Chinese Jump Ropes,I ordered 5 of these for my sons cub scout pack. They are very durable and the boys (ages 6-9) couldn't get enough of it. The only down side is that you need to find directions for the game on the internet because the ropes didn't come with any. Really happy with this purchase.
3,buy only if you already know how to use it,The chinese jump rope arrived and we had no idea how to use it. I assumed it would come with some basic directions. So buy it if you know how to use it or you will need to buy a separate book as we need to now.
5,You are going to love this stuff,"I never write reviews, but since I had such hard time deciding what to buy to condition my leather jacket last year, I thought I'd help you all out. No brainer - buy Mr. Leather.After owning my leather coat for about eight years, the exterior really started to look dry and scaly. Instead of getting rid of it, I decided to try to recondition it and bought Mr. Leather. The application was easy and my dry coat soaked up the Mr. Leather liquid like a Slurpee on a hot summer day. I'm a decent sized guy with a decent sized coat and probably used about 75% of the bottle on this application. Once I was done though, my coat looked fresh and as good as the day I bought it (no discoloration). I've also used this on my leather shoes when polishing them. And am now coming back to buy another bottle to use on the leather seats in our convertible."
3,Witchy Woman,"It's hard for any of Coelho's work to live up to the beauty that was Veronika Decides to Die, though The Witch definitely attempts this. Athena comes across as more of a fanatical woman who is bent on suffering in silence and mourning what could have been while not acting in the moment which is incredibly at odds with Coelho's message of being yourself no matter the costs. Beautifully written, though the the book lacks of characters I could identify with or want to identify with, this making it an arduous read.Bottom line: Beautiful but barely worth the time."
2,Fizzled Out,"This book started out well. I especially like how we find out about Athena from the various people in her life. However, about the time Athena found her voice, it seemed to turn into an Earth Godess sermon. The author lost me here. I did like the ending which I will not reveal. I listened to the Audio version of this book which was very well done."
3,To Be Honest.,"This is a good book, I was never disinterested or bored, however it is my least favorite of Coelho's books. If you've never read the author before I suggest you start with The Alchemist or Brida."
5,Life Changing,"This book came into my life right when I needed it. Cohelo manages to write books that are able to touch people in an amamzing way. This book is moving, beautiful, and life affirming. I walked away from this book feeling like I could find my life's purpose. I walked away from this book feeling like my spirituality does deserve my focused attention. Once again he writes a masterpiece."
3,Not Moved,"I am a huge fan of Mr. Coelho.I was blown away by The Alchemist and various other books he wrote. Sadly, The Witch of Portobello was not one of those books. It's not a quick read. It's overly simplistic and I'm having a heard time connecting to the dance trance thing. It's about 50 pages too long and half way into the book you just don't care about Athena's plight because she seems absolutely fanatical- not someone you can see yourself in--not someone you care about.There's about so many ways you convey the message to follow your heart and be yourself. It starts to beat you in the head toward the end and if you didn't waste money on the crap you would cast into a nearby fire and watch it burn"
1,A writer's gift dies by drowning in cliches,"I read The Alchemist years ago and liked it. Paulo Coelho is a mystic and in The Alchemist, mysticism has a proper place in the story. In contrast, in The Witch of Portobello, the characters and plot are mere skeletons whose sole purpose is to preach a kind of pagan mysticism (Coelho favored the Christian variety earlier, he seems to have switched). The characters for the most part speak in cliched phrases about love, being true to oneself, and finding a deeper meaning in life. Sadly, here Coelho uses his otherwise considerable writer's gift to make these cliches sound profound and new, mostly by restating them over and over in different turns of phrase. If you are a ""follower"" by nature and into paganism or New-agey spiritualism, you might like this book. Otherwise, you will wonder what happened to the Coelho you once enjoyed reading."
1,"not much story, flat characters","This book seemed like a sloppy drape for a sermon about mysticism. We spend the entirety of the book reading the impressions of the main character's acquaintences- yet these perspecitves are so alike that there is no transition in voice. It is a very crude way to move a story along that deals so heavily in character study; that all the ancillary characters be so painfully similar. It takes all the fun out of narrative in this perspecitve. The only coehlo- reminiscent writing comes in the form of short tutorials on spiritualism, and while the language is beautiful it reads like a primer and does not evoke the intended introspection. Boo."
3,The Witch of Portobello,"I picked this up at an international airport. It was displayed at the front of the store, and included the comment: ""sixty-five million readers can't be wrong"" by Publishers Weekly. Tagged onto anything, this is a false but tempting statement.It reads quickly and the subject matter is unique. The message is not new: the church is hypocritical and society enforces conformity at the expense of individuality. If a new fictional journey is more appealing to you than a new message, then this is a book that makes you curious about what happens in the end. And if you read it, there appears to be tens of millions of people you can discuss it with!"
5,A great addition to Coelho's collection,"I am a big fan of Coelho's books and The Witch of Portobello did not disappoint. It is a fast read, the middle does drag a bit but the ending pulls everything together. What I like most about this book was the interesting POV, the story being told through different people's perceptions of a single woman. Very enlightening and beautifully written."
3,Good motivational story,"I thought this was a book worth reading. I will say that I liked The Alchemist a little more, but both carry ample motivational ability. Reading this book makes all realize that even when we think we are dancing to the beat of a different drum, we rarely are. Most of what we accomplish is done on auto pilot and with little pure thought and minimal struggle. I like PC's simple style and his books are easy to read."
3,Interesting and thought provoking...,"Having read several of Coehlo's books and had my mind blown at how good they were, I was excited to find this. There were some transitions the main character makes in her evolution that I could definitely relate to."
4,A Touch of the Sacred Feminine,"Paulo Coelho touches on the sacred feminine, love, family, persecution and betrayal in this novel. Set in the form of a series of interviews by the author, with a plot twist at the end, the book is a lively if disjointed read. Sherine is the adopted daughter of a Marionte Christian family from Lebanon. Forseeing the war that ravaged that country for decades, the family relocates to London, and Sherine becomes Athena - the goddess of wisdom - as she begins to find herself and the roots of the world around her - culminating in her presecution and eventual death. A good novel, but not Coelho's best. Worthy of the read - especially if you are a Coelho fan."
1,A waste of time and money,I think this author must have been out of it when he wrote this book. It makes no sense at all. Worst book I have read.
5,Magical,"I just finished reading my first Coelho novel, The Witch of Portabello..and am on Amazon to purchase more of his stories. I found the book not only to be compelling and inspirational, but also, mysterious and confusing. The unknown is out there, and we must accept what we can never know, we aren't supposed to understand it all. By far one of my favorite stories...If you believe, it will happen"
1,Boring and pointless,"It is promising at first, but you keep waiting for a good part that never comes. I hated it."
1,A flash in the pan,"Coehlo came out firing with The Alchemist and By the River Piedra, however since then his writing has quickly slid. With redundant and dry prose, undergraduate philosophy and psychology, Coehlo uses his early successes to dupe readers into buying another ""International Bestseller"". Don't waist your money unless you are desperately in need of being beat over the head with the phrases 'follow your heart' and 'be who you were meant to be'."
2,A masterful writer misses the mark,"Coelho has inspired a generation of seekers, with his unique brand of new age spirituality, criticism of the mainstream, and engaging down-to-earth characterization. I am a great fan of his work. Thus, I was looking forward to reading the ""witch..."" However, was disappointed with the rehash of previous themes, and ultimately, with a novel that almost bored me to tears! There is little new or original in this work, and I would suggest that readers new to the work of coelho start with the alchemist, veronika decides to die, by the river piedra...etc."
5,Loved this,This book was so inpirational and a great read. This made me buy all of Coelho's other works as well.
4,Really fun,"I just bought this hovercraft from a buddy of mine and it is really fun. It works on land ,water and even snow. It can be really fast but is a little hard to control. There is only one problom, the battery life is short, 4 hours of charging for like 30 minites. And also on a lake or ocean with waves it wont work. But overall this is a great buy."
4,mostly the transcripts from the court preceedings,"Personally, I enjoyed this book (although there were some paragraphs that a felt safe to skip over without missing any vital information). However, be aware that this book is mostly a word for word transcript of the court proceedings. He does use these real court transcripts to help teach the reader some of the basics of court procedure and language"
3,Not for the casual reader,"If you are a scholar this may be useful to you, but it is too detailed, too full of long long long excerpts from the trial record, too boring to keep you awake late at night."
1,Peter the Great in duplicate!,"I agree with other reviews that Peter was an exceptional man and that the historical contents of the DVD has its merits. What potential customers need to be aware of is that this DVD is a copy of a chapter in volume II ofRussia - Land of the Tsars. It is unfortunate that Net Video is trying to increase its sales by serving the same dish under different names; but it is even more unfortunate that Amazon recommends that we buy both DVD! You have been warned, just buy one but not both."
3,Rather decent historical video,"This is a rather decent video, which gives some general ideas about the original personality of this outstanding Russian emperor, his biography and the epoch. It is good for students and for demonstrating during one of Russian Culture classes (History or Literature) as well as for watching at home for those who are interested in Russian culture. The only visible shortcoming of this film is frequent use of different kind of illustrations not related to Peter the Great times, which though could be explained by shortage of available pictures, prints, applied art objects, etc. This, unfortunately, creates some impression of sloppy selection of illustrating materials."
3,Meh,"I hate to say this because I love LWE's writings and I really enjoy this series but...wow, what a waste of time this book was. Hey, a 12-year-old girl might really like it but it just isn't up to par with anything else he's written. Sorry I bought it."
4,Microphone Headset for Costume,This was a very nice addition to my daughter's Halloween costume. She was Sharpay from High School Musical. The headset was lightweight and comfortable for my daughter to wear. She was pleased.
5,"Good length, if you're short.","The rope is fine. It's pretty non-descript: plastic, light, red handles. What I really like is the length of this rope. I'm 5'2 and the 8' length is great for me."
3,Too short.,"I feel like this would be a good jump rope if I purchased a longer rope. There is literally no way for me to use this rope because it keeps either hitting my head, or getting caught in my feet. Very disappointed."
3,The History of Scotland,"The Frys did an excellent job writing the history of Scotland when it came to the politics and kings of the old nation. The level of depth and detail was quite impressive and made for a slow enjoyable read. Of particular interest to me was the concrete and emotional description of the military affairs, which made for quite exciting reading indeed. The lack of attention to the economic life of the country is somewhat of a letdown however. Most sections are dispersed and attached almost as an afterthought. It is also quite clear that the interest of the authors flags after the Jacobite rebellions and the last 100 years is scarcely touched at all, with what little there is being a good study of the drive towards devolution. An additional chapter or two dealing with the 20th century would have made a good book excellent. This would have had the effect of clinching the reader's appreciation of the Scots, whom the Frys obviously love very much."
5,A must-read for aspiring or practicing hospice counselors,"Co-written by professional counseling staff members Moira Cairns, Marney Thompson, Wendy Wainwright and sanctioned by the Victoria Hospice Society, Transitions In Dying & Bereavement: A Psychosocial Guide For Hospice And Palliative Care walks the reader through the stages that chronically ill and dying individuals and their families must progress through, from diagnosis to death to bereavement. The most effective interventions for easing stress and confusion are clearly explained, along with sample dialogues that reveal the issues and challenges at each step. Chapters include notes on multicultural and interdenominational perspectives on death and dying, perspectives on body image, intimacy, and sexuality in the dying, ways to help alleviate feelings of anxiety, fear, burnout, denial, and powerlessness, ways to help in planning for death, and much more. A must-read for aspiring or practicing hospice counselors."
4,Transitions in Dying and Bereavement: A Psychosocial Guide for Hospice and Palliative Care,good information on dying and transitioning into the process
5,Extra special coloring book.,This coloring book is not just a child's coloring book. The pictures are in beautiful detail and look like the illustrations from a Caldecott book. It made for a very special stocking stuffer.
2,A bit of a stretch,"To call this a coloring book is a bit of a stretch. For me, coloring books usually have wide-open areas inside the figures in which to color. This book is really more line-art that you can rub a crayon or pencil over if you wish. There must be better Christmas coloring books out there."
2,not a real coloring book,this one was more like a story book that if u wanted too u could color i guess. i wanted a real coloring book. just to detailed to color.
5,Spiritual women,"For those who understand the Bible, this book offers an interesting new perspective on women of the Bible. Possibilities for personality characteristics are very interesting to read."
2,disappointing,"I ordered this book based on reviews. Although, others may find this book very inspiring, I didn't. It was only a few pages in that I realized this book was not going to be helpful to me."
5,www.valderbeebeshow.com,Daughters of the King : Finding Victory Through Your God-Given Personal Style by Gail M. HayesWalk Worthy Press -May 2005Full of inspiration and self-reflections.
5,Fantastic heater!!!!,"We used this heater in cold camping conditions - windy, rainy, cold weather. We were able to sleep in t-shirts and sheets! The propane tank sweats a bit so we like to put something underneath it to catch the condensation. And when first lighting be sure nothing is directly in front of the heater as it puts out a small fireball. Best camping accessory we've purchased in years!"
4,Works great!,"This unit kept our two room, 8 person tent warm and toasty when the tempatures dropped into the low 50s. It was easy and simple to use.The construction of the unit seemed somewhat below par for coleman as that the face and ring had to be dismantled, and then reassembled. It wasn't a big deal but for this price you would think that it would be correct out of the box!The blower is a little bit noisy but if your cold you won't mind. Overall I endorse it!"
2,Set off my CO detector,"I bought this for use in a camper van for snow trips. Supposedly safe for use indoors, but it set off my carbon monoxide detector after about an hour. I'm not comfortable at all using this inside. It would be a decent foot-warmer for off-season patio occasions though.If you get a catalytic heater like this, get a CO detector so you don't wake up dead.It's also larger than I thought-- the element is about 8 inches across. It's hard to tell from the picture, but that might matter to you if you plan on traveling with it.Running the first bottle of fuel through it outside got rid of the first-time fire-up smell.The build quality is rather poor. I had to remove the chrome ring and re-seat the element because it was not aligned with the chassis properly. The propane bottle presses against the plastic body."
5,good little heater,"I;ve owned this little heater for almost 2 years. Mainly use it in a small fiberglass travel trailer (18 footer similar to Scamp). Have used it several times in the mountains at 6,000 to 9,000 ft. with temps dipping to upper 20's. It really takes the chill off. Makes the little trailer seem almost warm though its really only in the lower 50's after running for some time. But heck, that beats a cold 28 degrees. The bottles last about like everyone says. I don't sleep through the night with it running but do turn it on a little while before getting up. Have also used it in a little workshop which was way bigger then my trailer. Did not do much good but it tried. Have probably ran it over 100 hrs with no problems. I like it and would recommend it."
4,Hands on approaches to a variety of Maskmaking techniques.,"I consider this one of the better books on Maskmaking techniques. It has easy to follow directions in a variety of modeling methods. Well illustrated, it makes what could have been a dry lifeless book into something that is accessable to all levels of Maskmaking experience"
4,Nice craft for adults and teens,"I bought this book, plus two other mask-making books and the Make A Mask kit and bundled them for a nice crafty Christmas gift. Well liked!"
2,Just for Beginners,"This book is for beginners ONLY. If you have ever tried to create your own masks in the past, you have probably figured out these techniques on your own. I was hoping for more finishing techniques, I received none. The examples in the book look amature and sloppy. It's a great book for someone who has NEVER tried to make a mask before or someone who needs to come up with a children's project (There is a whole section devoted to relating to kids). Most of the techniques described in this book can be found on online tutorials for free."
4,Love this series,"I have enjoyed all of the Eating Out movies... Hope there is another one. Funny, light hearted, campy but not overly so....Rent this movie."
1,More like vomiting after eating out,"the only thing worse than the bad acting is the directing of the film. I guess anyone with a camcorder can make a ""movie."" This movie is like a bad meal. Ingredients: bad acting, no story line. What a waste!"
3,Cra* but the guys are all pretty and some hot scenes!,"Not porn, not even soft porn, but hot guys! Script and acting and production are cheap and cra* but for watching pretty manly and hot boyish guys, its worth a few bucks!"
3,Dissapointing,"They are stretching Eating Out too much now. Staged at a summercamp... it's been (over)done. Rebekah Kochan should have been given a leading role again, but they didn't. Her role is small this time. Too bad! I liked that they added the transgender character, thumbs up for that! It was done in a respectful and believable way and the most interesting part. But other than that, the previous movies were better and funnier, especially the 3rd one. If you like twinks with hot bodies, you'll rate this movie 4 stars probably."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I was really looking forward to this movie because I really loved the 3rd one, as I felt the 3rd one was more touching with Casey's speech at the end. But the story line for this one wasn't as good. I was disappointed to see that Rebekkah Kochan only had a brief appearance in the movie, as I feel her ditzy blonde, slutty character is what helped make the other movies funnier. The woman at the camp who Casey became friendly with seemed to replace Rebekkah as Casey's faghag in the movie, and it just wasn't the same. This one was funny in some ways and it did feature some hot guys. Also, I don't want to spoil things for people who have not seen the movie yet, but I was also disappointed in regards to Zack and Casey's relationship."
1,Worst,Worst movie I have ever spent money to watch poor acting and very stupid story line. Do not watch this if you love movies
2,Not bad but not great,"I simply had to see it, since I watched the other Eating Out films recently. I was really hoping to see more of Rebekah Kochan (Tiffani) again, but her screen time was very limited & not as hilarious as before.There were a few stories in the film, some of them were pretty good.Lilach Mendelovich as Penny made up for my lack of Tiffani, she maintained some fair humor for me. I think I am more partial to Tiffani, but the character Penny did deliver some laughsOver all, not as great/funny as Eating Out; All You Can Eat, but the film is far from terrible"
2,Dont waste the time...,"FIRST of all, the whole pretense of all the Eating Out Sequels besides the 2nd one are just based on very nakked guys and sex...at least the first two there was a plot and you could understand it.BUT in this, 4th sequel, its just way too silly!SPOILER: As a gay guy, there is NO way id ever break up with my BF in order to get him together with another guy, that's ridiculous and totally unrealisic!Tiffany only had a cameo,and she should have been a major player in the entire movie!I have seen how these sequels seem to work..in the 3rd one,they killed off the main2 characters from the first 2movies ( Marc and Kyle) which was bad enough, but this 4th movie just goes to far in ridiculous situations and unfortunately,not all the hot nakked guys can make up for the lack of plot and the painful time that comprises this movie!Id recommend the first two highly and strongly, but after that RENT Dont waste your money please!"
1,PAPER THIN STORY THAT IS BEST BURIED,"The first in the series was great but with each sequel the films became less and less enjoyable. This is the worst (and last for me). Some dreadful (I mean 'really' dreadful) overacting from the two teachers which made me cringe.If they could only see their performances. A very weak storyline which was written on a postage stamp with room to spare. As the next in the series was filmed immediately after this film , one can only shudder at the possibility of having to endure another time waster. Most of the cast are okay but no serious acting is required from any of them. Time to bury the hatchet on this series"
2,snooze,"Buy a better movie, unless you have seen it and liked it. I bought it without seeing it. Big mistake. I like quality movies, not campy cheese."
4,"A Romanian ""Messiah""","Having just purchased and listened to this work, I was pleased and moved by its beauty. Based, like the ""Messiah"" of Handel on Biblical texts, as well as Byzantine liturgical texts, the music is splendidly melodic, and the singing powerful and moving. One note however: ""Byzantine"" refers only to the liturgical tradition of Romanian Orthodoxy. The music is decisively Western in style, and the language Romanian. This is NOT a Greek work...It is however well-worth its modest price. Definitely recommended."
4,"A haunting and beautiful piece: Constantinescu's ""Nativity""","This remarkable piece (and its composer as well) deserves to be known in a much broader circle of musical appreciation than it is currently. Using the principals and sonorities of byzantine musical forms but transposing them into an idiom readily accessible to lovers of western masses and oratorios, it reveals the composer's deep attachment to Christian religious sensibilities and his singular ability to give those sensibilities musical expression. Beautiful melodies interwoven with unexpected harmonies leave a haunting impression, as if one had only now gotten the true sense of the Messiah's annunciation and birth. I was deeply affected by hearing it. The soloists, chorus, and orchestra and are all excellent, especially the tenor who performs most of the narration; unfortunately the quality of the recording itself is technically less than ideal--but that only means that someone should do a better one!"
5,Sea Siege,This is an absolutely wonderful book. Exciting at all times. I have reread this book many times. And will read it again.
4,Wonderful oven,I've had my oven for 3 years now and cannot live without it. I've never had any problems at all with this oven. My grandson will not eat pizza cooked any other way.
2,Won't Feed Correctly with Bostitch F21PL Nailer,"These are Bostitch brand nails and are specifically designed for use with the Bostitch F21PL nail gun, but I had constant trouble using two different packages of these nails in two different brand-new F12PL guns.The problem seems to be that the plastic collating ""stuff"" is too thick to feed easily in the gun. So every time I shoot a nail, I had to pull and release the feeder spring tension gizmo to force the next nail into position. That really slowed down our job, which included 132 metal connectors, each taking between 10 and 14 nails.Aside from the feed problem, the nails were fine and the F12PL with the special metal connector nail tip worked great to set the nails squarely in the holes on the connectors."
5,Awesome Trailer,"I did my homework before deciding on the trailer I wanted. This trailer won hands down. It is well consructed, and easy to assemble. The only change I would make is make the plastic parts out of metal. I feel that this would help in making it more rigid, especially in the floor area.I almost bought another brand trailer, but decided on this one because of the Croozer reputation.I still gave it five stars. Buy it and you will not be sorry."
5,"best ever,price,shipping","i had never been so happy i got it in to days,its just what i wanted, put it together in 5 min, thank you very much"
4,An Excellent Trailor,"Inexpensive, light and handy. So why not 5 stars? I'm a bit tough on ratings. Perhaps if it pedaled some of the way..."
3,Croozer review,This cargo trailer is only average. The cover does not fit well. The velcro straps at the corners do not fit properly around the supports and the cover does not stand up under high winds and rain. The floor of the basket is not as sturdy as it could be. A couple of light wieght metal supports should be strung under the flexible flooring for more support.
4,All around OK,"I purchased this from Amazon for $200 w/ shipping and everything. I wanted a cargo trailer that would fold and that was rectangular. This is the only one that I found after a quick search. w/ free shipping it was hard to pass up.All around it's a good folding design. It's similar in quality to a child's trailer. Some of the joints are plastic, while I wish they would be metal. I'm concerned it will wear out after a lot of use (how I plan to use it). If you don't need it to fold up, you might want to purchase a rigid all-metal trailer."
1,Sad,I only give 1 star because that was the lowest rating offered. If this book were fiction I would just dismiss it as lousy. If indeed this is an actual account of a real person's life it can only be described as pathetic. I truly feel sorry for the author whose self respect is obviously non-existant.
2,Disc purchased from abroad not playable,"Saw this concert on Netflix streaming and just had to own it, but when it arrived we discovered it would not play on the high-def DVD in the family room. Got the error message ""Cannot play this disc. Video format of the disc does not meet required video output format of this product. Discs purchased from abroad may not be playable."" The disk did play in an older DVD in the office, but that is an inconvenient place to watch. Disappointing."
1,Not really what it says it is,"This video is probably not exactly what you think it is. Note that it's only about an hour long - it is a verrrrry heavily edited version. No Crickets at all, Gary Moore's first verse of Red House was completely cut.....would have been great if it was the ""real"" video."
5,Great fun,"SOME OF THE BEST GUITAR WORK YOU WILL EVER SEE. The reason Fender made the ""Stratocaster"" almost every great rock guitar player used one.A must see!"
1,Where are all the Fender Signature Stratocaster Players?,"Bonnie Raitt, Eric Johnson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Robert Cray, John Mayer, Buddy Guy, Richie Blackmore, etc. The list goes on. The ONLY REAL and most famous Strat player on this DVD is the Great David Gilmore. And as far as Brian May and his Guild Signature Edition, that no one buys because it's an over-priced piece of junk? He shouldn't have been on stage at all if he couldn't bring himself to PLAY A STRATOCASTER AT A TRIBUTE TO THE STRATOCASTER.Not recommended because it's Recorded in England. Not in Southern California where it was born."
3,Not as good as I would have expected,"...I agree with much of what has been written here. Just to summarize, as a musician, I enjoyed watching most of it; but it's pretty lame for such a momentous anniversary. Also:1. Couldn't Fender round up some of it's signature artists (Clapton, Blackmore, etc.) ... even for taped appearances?2. How lame to have a band with no keys, players using Gibson and other brand guitars, some musicians most people have never heard of.3. How lame to see Paul Rogers struggling to read the lyrics to the finale (stay with me) and Ronnie Wood trying to direct the others; couldn't they have done a couple of rehearsals for such an event?4. Ronnie Wood's voice shattered my fish tank and killed a guppy"
4,Definitely a Buy,"I watched this perforformance in HD on HDNet several times. As others have mentioned here there are some great performances, and the performance by Gary Moore certainly is incinderary. However since the Stratocaster has been around for a long time, this concert is useful in order to be exposed to artists you would not see elsewhere. For example, I was mesmerized by Hank Marvin's guitar playing, which illustrates that one does not have to play fast or hard in order to produce facinating sound from the guitar."
3,TOO MANY MISSING,"First of all, there was absolutely no reason for Ronnie Wood to be there. His Ooh La La was awful. Albert Lee and Gary Moore stole the show. Albert Lee was incredible on COUNTRY BOY and Gary Moore was the same on RED HOUSE. They should have done more songs. David Gilmore was David Gilmore, BORING AS USUAL. Joe Walsh was pretty good and I couldn't figure why Brian May was there. He's not excactly a Strat guy and he's a hog. When Garry Moore, Albert Lee and Joe Walsh are on stage, there is no reason for Brian May to play. He's good but not that good. They could have picked a better song to end with. What about the great Strat players like Clapton, Blackmore, Beck even that new guy Henry Garza. Overall, alot of mediocre stuff but Gary Moore and Albert Lee save an otherwise boring show. It is well worth the price to see those 2 do their thing."
4,great lineup of real talent,"Great looking/sounding concert featuring some major players in the history of the Stratocaster. Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets led by Sonny Curtis sing Buddy's hits and legendary British guitar instrumentalist, Hank Marvin shows why he's a legend(at least in Britain.) Paul Carrack and Mike Rutherford(Mike and the Mechanics) sound great. There's a lot of fine music here but why only one song from Gary Moore - the best guitarist in the show. And why on a program dedicated to the Fender Strat,does Jamie Cullum do a song without any guitar whatsoever? That seems odd."
2,Disappointed,"I have watched this show twice on the television and I am surprised at how asleep the audience seems. The music was ok, but only OK. why did this have to be in the UK..? Just thought it could have been better."
2,Seriously?,"This is a painful experience. I mean, whoever put this together or organized this event has no clue on music legends, music history, music business, etc., etc., etc.. When you think of Fender legends, ok atleast surviving legends, Eric Clapton is at the top of the list...end of. So E.C. was not here but we get one-time E.C. mate Albert Lee? Albert is a capable guitarist in his own right,same with Andy Fairweather Low playing acoustic with basically Mike and the Mechanics?!? And Mike Rutherford...doesn't even play one lead lick! I mean seriously I could go on and on about this. There is hope when David Gilmour plays a brief set. Ronnie Wood and Joe Walsh are here. Brian May, although never and not a Strat man. Gary Moore = LEGEND...but again not a Strat Man...yeah there i go again, like I said whoever organized this event should be FIRED. Great performances by everyone performing but a Strat Pack it is not."
1,Horrible DVD,"Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh canbe heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised."
3,The Strat Pack,I gave it 3 stars for the 3 guitar players that I enjoyed.I feel that it was not balanced out with everyone that was on this DVD.
1,Paying for a boring 155 minutes commercial,"After being blessed with the likes of ''Concert for George'' and ''Paul McCartney in Red Square'' this is a terrible let down. Save for The Crickets, Albert Lee and Hank Marvin who offer a descent performance this DVD stinks. The other performers are totaly unconvincing, they go through the motions and seem totaly bored and boring. The audience is unresponsive. If a guitar manufacturers want to advertise their product they should do it with their money not ours, because obviously this is what it is ; a boring 155 minutes commercial from a company who has long ago strayed from the original philosophy of its founder the great Leo Fender. Don't waste your money."
3,Look for some hidden gems,"The overall DVD is ok but does lack some real hot tracks that would be expected from this type of production. Hank Marvin backed by his son has three great tracks with excellent musicianship and production making these tracks hidden gems. ""Sleepwalk"" was incredible and ""Apache"" still has some kick to it as both benefit from excellent arranging and performances by the back up musicians. David Gilmour was fabulous as usual and if Pink Floyd etherial rock and roll is your calling (it is mine) then he will not disappoint. Enjoy what is there and don't worry about the other weak performances."
4,For guitar lovers,I'm a professional drummer that also plays guitar. I enjoyed most of this DVD. The one part that didn't do much for me was Amy Winehouse. She's not a good guitarist and not sure why she's included in this concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar. The rest of the concert is great.Joe Walsh was the highlight for me and also Gary Moore.Preston Ritter
3,Follow Me,"Visions of a past she never lived haunt Claire. In her dreams, she is Kate, a woman doctor in a time when such a thing was unheard of and in love with Harcourt Abernathy, a heartstoppingly handsome man whose memory infiltrates her entire waking life. Compared to him, Ian, her controlling, obsessive compulsive, angty would be fiance' is a pale shadow, and frankly annoying. Yet, as Ian watches Claire slip into a dream world, he is terrified and reacts badly. Meanwhile, in the past, events move towards an inevitable parting of the two lovers by death. To retain the love of his life, Harcourt will be forced into a desperate move that could kill the woman he loves in both worlds.*** Though a haunting tale, the frequents shifts from past to present make for a confusing story that could easily lose the reader. Claire and Harcourt's story is compelling, but a more coherent tale would be appreciated. ***Amanda Killgore."
4,Follow Me: In love with the past.,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good book. At first I had a hard time of really getting into because of my dislike of Claire's boyfriend, Ian. I really could not stand how he always had to throw little comments at her to belittle her for every little thing she did.Anyway, after I got past that the book was pretty good. There was a lot of bouncing around from the present to the 1800's but it was pretty easy to follow.It's a story about a girl, Claire who is haunted by her past. She had an incredible night of passion with a man who she felt was the love of her life. This man was a person she could only assume as a ghost. This book is about her trying to get on with her life with her boyfriend and forget about the man who she felt that she's always known.It's not the best book I've ever read, but it was pretty good."
2,A little scary for a 3 year old,"I bought this for my 3 year old who was fascinated about the idea of going to the moon. After I read this to her, she no longer wanted to go. It scared her. I know it's true, but did it really need to be written that their skin would burn if the spacesuit came off??"
1,Horrible Camera!! Don't buy it!,"We had a really good Fuji camera couple years and it took some great pictures. But somehow it broke down. But for some reason my dad bought this Fujifilm F470, pictures are like puzzles pieces, when you take a picture of a portrait..you can see all this kinds of square thing!Bad picture quality! Don't buy! This is the most horrible camera i ever used!"
5,Amazing camera!!,"I LOVE THIS CAMERA!! It's small and perfect, takes great pictures, and very easy to use. I ONLY buy Fuji cameras because they are the easiest and best. Recommended to anyone!!"
1,"Not good quality, and NO ENGRAVING!","This item stated I would receive an email about the engraving, which did NOT happen. Don't believe it. It arrived, but I'm returning it anyways rather than have it engraved myself because it's very cheap quality!!!! Did not like at all."
1,wish i had read all the reviews...,"I bought this cheaper product over a more expensive product because they were offering free engraving. I selected expedited delivery because I wanted to make sure it wouldn't get stuck in the mail after the time it takes to engrave. At this point, I'm at the price of the better quality, higher priced product.Well, the product did arrive quickly in good condition. There was no follow up email once the order was placed for engraving as promised. I am now stuck with a product I'm not crazy about that I will now spend over $25 to engrave. If I had read all the reviews, I would have known to immediately email the company to make sure my engraving order was in.Very disappointed at the lack of customer support. If I had known I would have gone with another company."
3,An effort to sell to the unconverted,"I'm a huge proponent of the Natural Building movement so much of the information in this documentary is not new. The main issue I had with this is that the thrust of the narrative seems to be that Cob - apart from all other natural building materials (they even take a jab at using straw bale ??) - can save the planet. It's a little too far reaching, too preachy, and you, know, too too. I can't imagine anyone tracking this title down and watching it would not already understand that there is an immediate need for alternative building practices.On the plus side, there is some excellent footage of some really beautiful architecture."
4,Columbia Sportswear Women's Cascadian Snowchill Boot,These boots are warm and comfortable. They're easy to slip on and work well for running errands. My only complaint is that the zipper slides down sometimes while I'm wearing them. It's not a problem for walking in slushy parking lots.
1,Hated it.,"Used this book as an undergraduate... hated it... I kept using a little thin old edition of ""Complex Variables and Applications"" by Churchhill to actually teach math using english.... Ironically the instructor who was teaching out of his notes followed churchhills presentation closer then this text.The treatment of this subject in this text is just so horrid for a FIRST LOOK AT COMPLEX THEORY. No elegance to it what so ever..."
1,Too much unrelated material for a first-year course,"This book has little organization, and features contrasts such as advanced topology at one point and trivial calculations at another. It has relatively hard theory, but trivial problem sets. In our Introductory Complex Class, only those that knew the subject from reading better books, such as Alfhors and Churchill, have competence with the basic theory."
3,Summer (1999) Dual in Berkeley!,"This Summer (1999), a hitted debate went on in UC Berkeley's Math 185 classroom. A group of three seniors from Cal who studied Marsden's book fiercely. During the debate, one even waved her Marsden book up in the air to stress her point, like the Red Guards waved Mao's little red book during China's Cultural Revolution. One group composed of two .....(I better skip this part!) who made their arguments based on Cartan's book (the $8.95 book suggested by my prior reviewer.) The subject was a contour integral of meromorphic function by applying Residue Theorem. Maybe for cautious reason and the respect to seniors, the teacher didn't hand down her judgement until the next day. Guess what? You bet! Cartan won!"
3,Mediocre Textbook!,"Complex analysis is a simple subject to teach and to learn. There is no reason to include so many pages, still couldn't comprehensively cover all the salient points. Mediocre students taught by mediocre teachers will by all means find this book ""excellent"" in their own right! I disagree with both one-star and five-star rating. I did find my students confused by this book and its ""answers"". It is not student-friendly at it worst. I will never use this book as my textbook again despite my distaste of its price tag. Unfortunately, the math level of US college students is persistently sliding down. The level of reviewing this book as well as many others are also disappointingly low. For US community college complex analysis course, this book can be rated for five stars. But, for major universities such as U. C. Berkeley, MIT and Caltech, this book deserves a three-star rating fairly. After all, there are good US universities ranked high in math level among the world."
3,"Good, but could be better","This book has excellent examples and most of the proofs are very easy to understand. It's a great book to use if you're learning complex analysis on your own.It's not, however, the only book you should use. I prefer math books that are more condensed with short, easy-to-read theorems. I would not list this book under such a category. In fact, many of it's theorems are so long, they require you to turn back and read other theorems pages earlier just to figure out what the necessary conditions are to use the theorem. I found this to be confusing and it slowed me down quite a bit. Therefore, if you have the same preference, I would suggest using this book only for its examples and exercises."
3,Kit and Play,"I am working on an in-depth research project on Catwoman, and I must admit, even though this book is visually compelling..that is all that it is. Catwoman is constantly viewed as a 'visual' character (read this as meaning sexualized), with little to no attention paid to her origins, actions, etc. It is crazy to see how many books are written on Batman, yet only two appear about Catwoman (both concerned with the visual more than anything else). Interesting....(in a bad cultural commentary way)..This book is a nice collectable..but dont buy it for research purposes, or expect any in depth commentary on the character. You'll be dissapointed."
2,disappointing effort,"although this book has lots of pictures (but not as many as you'd think, as some appear more than once), it has practically no content. it's very cute but not worth the 18 bucks. i wish someone would write a real history of catwoman, but this book is not it."
5,My best lens,I love this lens. It focuses so quickly and quietly that the only way you know it happened are the dots in the view finder. The first time I used I thought the lens wasn't focusing but it was just really quick and quiet. Focus is dead on. I already had the firmware upgrade on my K10D so it was dead on right out of the box. The image quality is fantastic even at 16mm. I haven't noticed any distortion on any of my images that you might expected from a super wide lens. This is the lens I should have gotten with my K10D instead of the Tamaron lens set that I got instead. I haven't had the lens that long so I don't know if I will have the QC issues that others have reported. If I do I will update this review.
2,Dud if you ever saw one!,The lens initially really impressed in build quality and the packaging was good.The moment I started shooting however it was evident the lens consistantly focussed behind the focus point. This is very dissapointing!With subjects 3-4 ft away the focal point is between 2-4 inches behind and on portraits 6-10ft away the focal point is between 2-4ft behind!PENTAX very disappointing!Anton Punt
3,Great or not Great,"If you search the Pentax forums you will see that this lens has a return rate estimated to be 5%-10% to 50% to more. The issue is quality control. One major difficulty is front and rear focusing issues. Pop photography says the simga 18-50 is better optically and costs half as much. However, this lens seals your K10d or K20D against dust and rain water. It also has ultra smooth focusing. So after reading everything on the net and buying one here, the issue is ""did you get a good one or not"" I haven't had time to test mine, but I have some suspicions from some pictures I have taken that it front focuses. When Pentax gets is QC straight, this lens will be an exceptionally good deal in my opinion"
2,sharp and smooth,"The built quality is exceptional. sharp, smooth and fast AF. Be sure to update your k10D firmware to v 1.3 before using this lens, so you wont be like me at first scratching my head wondering why a lens this expensive is noisy and vibrates. The lens is made in vietnam-nothing wrong with that, for some reason I was under the impression it was made in Japan.7/16/11 UpdateThis lens did not last, been repaired/replaced twice already because it quit autofocusing. Used it from k10 to K5. Changed my star rating from 4 to 2"
2,Nice while it worked,"As with many others my SDM died. The lens will no longer auto-focus, only works on manual. I guess I'll send it in for repair or buy something else. It did take beautiful pictures while it worked though so I'll give it 2 stars."
3,Not worth the price.,"This lens is decent but not greatPros:1) Fantastic build quality2) Colors that you get from this lens are pretty good3) Weather Proofing just amazingCons:1) Very expensive comapred to sigma and tamron alternatives2) Very big and large: Not fun to use3) Very slow focusing.4) Corner sharpness is very bad wide open: Its OK when stopped down5) Center sharpness not the best either6) Tamron is only $400 and is much much sharperIm not say that this is a bad lens. Im just saying that it is way overpriced. The tamron 17-50 f/2.8 and sigma 17-50 f/2.8 are much sharper, faster focusing, and way smaller. And they are only $400 and $550!!! For that price you can get yourself an additional 18-55wr and still have money left! Only reason i Bought it because i went to alaska and it was POURING. The lenses weather proofing is the only part that I can vouch for"
4,Visions for Black Men,Vision for Black men is a must read. I enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone especially black men. I give the author of this book two thumbs up.
4,Bird Lover,We had searched all over for a bag to replace the one we had in Illinois-we are now in Nevada. Finally we found this one and the birds are slowly coming to it. We had seven yesterday and had to refill it. It hangs nicely from a plant holder-one thing it could use is a clasp or drawstring at the top so it isn't wide open. When I ordered it it didn't offer the roof-maybe I could get one?
3,"Good Questions, but unnecessarily complex board play.","Copyright 2003, so don't expect any ""new"" questions. Questions range from easy to very challenging, and cover the gamut of rock and pop styles and eras. Unfortunately game-play is a bit convoluted, and doesn't offer an easy option for a ""condensed"" game that takes less time."
3,Need music friends/Family,This is a fun and great game....However you must have friends/family who also enjoy music and music history to make this enjoyable for all who play....If not it can become boring and not challenging. If you do have friends/family who enjoy music and music history then this will be a great purchase!! I love mine!
1,Never got a chance to play the game,"The game was advertised as in very good condition. But when it arrived, the front cover had an inventory sticker on it from a Houston youth group. There were critical pieces missing. Will not purchase from this provider again."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but...","The author spends so much time trying to be ""precious"" and ""clever"" that his narrative is confusing. Where am I? In England? America? Who am I reading about? Huh? Going back a few pages didn't help.A total disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"After reading Irving Kristol's books, this was a big disappointment. With the exception of the essays by Irving Kristol, this book is a waste of your time. If you are interested in learning about neoconservatism, grab a book by Irving Kristol. This ""reader"" is junk."
3,Neocons' self-selection,"They are, thankfully, on the way out. But for an overview of what they think on a range of issues, this is an effective showcase selected by one of their own. It is a political cul de sac that leads nowhere and one has to ask: what do the necons have against democracy? Because that is, despite the closet full of disguises, essentially what they are railing against."
1,Doh!!!,"If you agree with them, the book is of course brilliant. If you disagree with them, the book is a waste of paper.Since I do not agree with them, and wanted to learn their arguments, I thought it was a waste of paper. It seemed more like a collection of chatechismic provebs that social analysis, but then, much of the liberals, radicals, moderates essays suffer from the same ineffable quality.The book is a waste of paper because readers might better read books such as Prestowitz's Three Billion New Capitalists, or Peterson's Running on Empty to encounter an intelligent and conservative critique of our nation today."
2,Hanes big & tall ankle # 145/6,"Bought this item numerous times in K-MART & no problem. Now ""big & tall"" shrunk to smurf size. I never use hot water,only a few degrees above cold. If this fails to meet 75 words rule i could rant on about plastic junk ripping off consumers. When my plastic onion dicer broke i was in tears."
3,Crazy Socks,"Very creative patterns and a good exploration of the toe-to-top sock method. Also a very creative sort of book, with a companion poster that illustrates the socks. I am still not sure which one I want to knit, however. Maybe none of them--just use the designs for inspiration.If you aren't au fait with the toe up knitting method, you'd be better off getting the Magnificent Mittens book along with this book; the explanation of toe up knitting is the same as tip-down-mitten knitting. The illustration and explanation is better in Anna's mitten book. Plus you can adapt the mitten patterns to the sock methods. All in all, this is a fun book that can expand your sock knitting horizons. Anyway, get it as these books evaporate into out-of-print land all too fast."
4,couldn't have done better myself,"not as good as the original frosh, but a great come back to one of the best ""various artist"" albums I have ever bought."
2,When innocence threatens ...,"This could have been a decent murder mystery acted out in the beautiful settings in and around Seattle. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been a quick weekend job: A hastily assembled, ill fitting mess of standard scenes and situations which lead towards a so called surprise ending which can be expected from miles away. The only redeeming factor is the performance of Beverly d'Angelo - it's several notches above that of any actor in this movie (I mean, reliable and excellent charactor actor Richard Crenna is always good but he really doesn't seem to have put much heart into this matter). What amazed me is that even her dialog seems to be much better than that of the others. Is this just a proof of her wonderful acting talents or did she rewrite her own lines?"
2,Find Another Book!,"Holy frijoles, what a waste of money! A disorganized jumble of largely useless information, peppered with Jesus Freak anecdotes. A couple of good points that could be summarized in one page are agonizingly drawn out across an entire book that feels like the author was struggling to meet the minimum required pages or something. I can't remember the last time I bought a book this bad - and I was driven largely by the positive reviews here on Amazon. I was compelled to write this now before the next poor sod contributes to this amateurish debacle."
3,Fun but repetitive,This game is fun but can be repetitive over time. The graphics are nice. The game helps me learn how difficult it is to build and maintain a healthy city.
5,Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom,"I loved the game when I originally bought it several years ago, but that original copy got lost in the move to the new house. This game is a replacement that I got for dirt cheap.....Thanks Amazon"
5,Satisfying even without eggroll,"I was not too enthusiastic about venturing into chinese city building after playing the various incarnations of Caesar and Pharaoh over several years. My experience with Zeus (Greek city builder) was a disappointment with its slightly comic graphics and intrusive gods. But the graphics, music and gameplay in Empire draws one into the Sim completely. It is a very satisfying visual and historical change from the other city builder sims.The play is similar to earlier offerings in the genre so the learning curve is easy. At the price of the Sim, and its accurate visuals, I highly recommend it to established players of the genre, or to novices that have never played such a sim before. There are fortifications and battles, but it isn't the focus of the Sim as is the case with the entire genre. But it is a well rounded Sim that will give many hours of interest."
3,Average city builder game,"I didn't play the game very long so maybe it gets better but it just didn't impress me. There did not seem to be any way to zoom in or out. I could never get a look at my whole settlement, just pieces of it at any one time. Time itself was either on or paused, no faster or slower speeds. Buildings were constructed instantaneously, just popping up like mushrooms when you decided to construct one. If you were short on workers you could just ""turn off"" some buildings and the workers would go to another one. People were interchangeable, a fisherman could become an acrobat, a musician could become a farmer, etc. Also, you had to put up ""roadblocks"" to keep people from wandering off aimlessly. It seems like that was just a way to compensate for poor programming. There seems to be a lot of micromanagement necessary to play the game. If you are o.k. with that then the game is worth a look. Otherwise I can't recommend it."
5,From Back Cover,"When the Duke Hsuan Ch'i sends a group of ninjas to kill the elderly General Tieng and kidnap his daughter the beautiful, Szu Chin, she is rescued by their friend, Chang Chou. However their freedom is bought at the expense of General Tieng's life. Together Szu Chin and Chang Chou make their way to another kingdom.But Duke Ch'i still loves the lady Szu Chin, and after Chang Chou dies in a far off country, the Duke makes it his life's ambition to regain Szu Chin, even if it costs him his life. which it does, as he and the newly arrived Prince of Chun have a duel to the death over the beautiful Szu Chin.With the Prince of Chun victorious, he wins the lady Szu Chin as a bride, but soon after, the air of death that had surrounded Szu Chin returns, this time to claim her newest beloved and drive the beautiful Szu Chin into madness.This tale of haunting love and swordplay pushes wuxia films to the limit of both physical skill, and human emotion"
5,Best Peeler in the known world,"This product actually makes peeling a joy and not so much of a chore. I actually enjoy it now and don't buy ""baby"" cut carrots anymore. I never thought I would ever, ever say that about a peeler. It's been a year and I have no regrets. The blade is super-sharp still. The peeler is perfectly balances in your hand, it's a good grip surface even with potato goo all over my hands, and the thing at the end to scoop out potato eyes is so wonderful. it's not sharp but gets out the pesky bad spots in foods so well! I'm getting everyone a peeler for a gift this year. You think I'm kidding until you try it. I think if my house burned to the ground this is one of those few things I would get the same on of all over again."
3,Top heavy,"Before buying the Pro model, I had the standard OXO peeler model for at least 5 years. One of mine must have ended up in the bin with scraps so I looked for a replacement. I picked up 2 so as to have a spare and to take advantage of the 4 for 3 offer. They are nice, but do not seem to peel as well as my older model (the angle of the cut is not as deep). The metal part of the peeler is also much heavier than the handle, so it feels a bit awkward in your hand."
5,Wonderful little kitchen tool!,"I have had this peeler for about 3 years now, and I love it! Makes the chore of peeling feel less than a chore. The blades are still very sharp (I did not sharpen them since I bought it). I had bought the replacements blades just in case, but have not needed to use them yet.Great quality, very sharp and durable. A must for every household, in my opinion."
3,and this is the i-series,"dont know how to explain but it is just awkward, g-friend doesnt like it either. we like our $6.00 kitchen aid one from walmart better. For us not worth the extra $4"
2,DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL,For a peeler I felt it was too heavy. It also did not FEEL comfortable to use. I also did not feel it was much sharper than my old one which I have been using for 3 years.
1,REPLACEMENT BLADES???,"This is a great idea that must be difficult for Oxo to follow through on. Where on Earth can I find replacement blades? Unless a future buyer knows the answer to this question, I would recommend staying away from this product."
5,a kitchen must-have,"Who knew that having a sharp new peeler blade could transform food prep? This is a comfortable, well-designed tool. The little end scoop doesn't look adequate but in fact it's perfectly up to the task of removing potato eyes and blemishes on fruit."
5,Great peeler!,"This peeler has a comfortable grip, slices thinly enough that you are not wasting vegetable, and even has a notcher to remove potato eyes! Very happy with my purchase."
3,Guess I am old school,Now that I have arthritis a touch of in my hands peeling potatos has turned into a literal pain. This girl loves potatos so looked for something to help. This has some good reviews but for me it doesn't work too well. It is sharp but I can see why the serrated edge is the way to go on one of these little rascals. Serrated bites into the peel and you aren't skipping down the peeling like you can with this one. Also it's kind of big and bulky to me. The swivel doesn't help either. This all being said it does do a great job on parm cheese and choc. I will go back to paring knife.
3,Great until it broke,"I loved the peeler, but it came apart in my hands as I was hand drying it. A small metal part that holds the blade flung off into the air... never did find it. Hopefully OXO will send me a replacement without me needing to spend the money to send this one back."
5,Best Vegetable Peeler,"This is probably the best peeler I've ever used. Far better than the cheap peelers you'd get at the grocery store. The peeler is cast out of zinc and has a soft, rubberized coating on the grip. It is nicely weighted and shaped perfectly. The blade is also wickedly sharp; on par with a high-quality kitchen knife. I used it to peel some carrots and potatoes for a stew and it worked much quicker and with less fuss than my old peeler. Highly recommended."
3,i-Series Y Peeler is much more convenient,I purchased this with i-Series Y Peeler. I find Y peeler much more convenient for potatoes.
2,maybe not,"I purchased a new peeler to put in a second area in the kitchen. Only thing is my old peeler works slightly better and it is a lot older. I don't like the idea that I can purchase a new blade on this one either. Heck, I'd rather not bother with changing blades and just buy a new one. Just doesn't do it for me."
3,get used to it,"Odd.Rolled this on, head is loose. Base is tight enough - actually a little too tight, couldn't get it all the way down, but it grips the shaft well, so will not fall off, sure of that.The head though kind of flaps around.... fairly unattractive so it isn't the condom you want to use when waggling around in front of others.... but if you just whck it on to whack it in... then they will be fine.The looseness certainly helps the feeling of clarity... but... would I buy them again? Sorry, no...."
3,Mediocre Strength,"We use these hooks to hold hanging baskets on our front porch. We have eight baskets each year. When the wind blows, these hooks often are pulled right off the anchor screws, sending my baskets tumbling into the yard. And with each successive fall, the threads get stripped a bit more, making future falls inevitable. I've probably gone through twenty of these hooks in three summers.I've solved the problem this year by buying a new set of hooks and dropping a bit of super glue into the hole before screwing each hook onto the anchor screw. It seemed to work -- no falls since I used the glue. But I shouldn't have to do that.The hooks do look great. I suggest that the manufacturer maybe provide a weight recommendation so that consumers know how much they can safely hang on each hook."
4,Great for holding the hoops,The hoop holders are very sturdy for there material and hold up the hoops perfect for our track club kids.
4,Excellent basic book for Console Radio Collectors,"This book presents an excellent overview of console radios through the 1942 period. The B&W photos were likely taken from manufacturer's brochures, but as llustrative as they are, too many are small and ""muddy"". Radio details are hard to define. The book seems geared primarily to the high-end collector as illustrations of the more collectible radios are much more clearly rendered. Note that (a) not all models of every console ever manufactured are included, and (b) some of the smaller players in the early market are missing. Lastly, because the book was printed in 2000, the value estimates are out of date. They do, however, give a good indication of the general value relationship between models. As a solid basic presentaion of radio consoles built up to WWII, the book is excellent overall."
3,"The ""weak sister"" of I-beam levels","There is nothing ""heavy duty"" or ""professional"" about this level: It's made of very light weight aluminum, and bends very easily. If you drop it, as they say in NYC, ""fuggedaboutit!"" Mine has been roughed up a bit, just the usual workplace accidents, and each time the frame bent. Also, the vials are small and hard to read. Wish I had saved my money and paid a little more for something more ruggged."
4,It's Great for solving a lot of problems but isn't recent,"It met my test because what I needed to know was easy to find and I was able to make a quick fix while maintaining Java software and I knocked out a couple of problems that way. It was easy to read, a good index and had sample implementations. The only problem I found is that it seems out of date and I would gladly purchase a more recent edition."
2,Danger Will Robinson!,"I don't usually write ranty negative reviews, but this book is horrible. I know because I'm an advanced swing developer working with a new swing developer who's been pulling code snippets out of this book and I keep having to rewrite them. It's a nightmare and it's slowed down our project. Right now I am rewriting some code from this book that makes swing calls in a non-swing thread. This is a Swing 101 mistake. You might say ""well, sure, but it's a hack"", but there's no need for it. At all. I don't know how this happened because Chris Adamson is a really smart writer and great programmer. I've read some of his other books and used his other sample code and it's great. I am giving it two stars instead of 1 because the quality of the writing appears high, but I am confiscating it from the other developer."
4,Deeper Insight into Swing with a Strong Mac OS Bias,"You will learn a lot about the deeper layers of Swing. You will learn a lot, why all those nice ideas in Swing - you already tried - did not work. You will get a lot of ideas on how to solve Swing problems.You will not get production ready code you can safely publish in a library. You will curse Swing at a new level of proficiency.In short a worthwhile book for the experienced Swing programmer that helps to advance you a couple of steps."
3,Useful book,"Despite the fact majority of described hacks are on the edge of their usefulness, the book is very useful. After reading you remember what can be done using Swing and what limitations exist. You will also find quite a lot of clever solutions not only related to the Swing itself."
3,Interesting but not very useful,"This book gives a good set of more in depth approaches to building GUI in Swing. While reading it I had a lot of 'that's interesting' moments. However, a lot of the examples feel more like an idea of what needs to be done to achieve something rather than a complete (and robust) implementation. What is more disappointing, I found that some advice in the book is misleading. For example Hack #57 demonstrates how to use the glass pane to intercept and riderect mouse events. Unfortunately, as demonstrated, this approach doesn't work at all in the applications that use any components that have menus. A very significant shortcoming, in my opinion, that is not mentioned in the book."
5,"Great ""first book"" for baby","This colorful board book is rhythmic and soothing--a wonderful ""first book"" for baby. It also features a baby breastfeeding which is nice to see and unusual for baby books which nearly always feature bottle-feeding. Your little one will love it and you'll like reading it."
1,A riveting read but misleading.,"As the the cover of the book indicates, this book is intended to be a race relations handbook for both whites and blacks. Unfortunately, it misses the mark completely. The book negatively portrays African Americans and simply asks that whites indulge them for all indiscretions because being black is hard. The book has little academic value."
2,But ... so what?,I found myself wishing the author would include more statistics to demonstrate his conclusions. Nice work. Lots of poetry!
1,All except one!,"The only funny track is the first one by Steven Colbert, the guy from The Daily Show. His sarcasm and satire is gut busting! However, the rest are a waste of time."
2,It's not funny,"There are 5 pieces on here, 2 of them - by Franken and Colbert - are a little humourous, the other 3 are just awful. It's hard to understand why this ever got recorded."
3,Good but with some catches,"Batman goes up against the Predator for the third time as obvious from the title. The catch this time is that the Predator is paired with an apprentice and the Predator-in-training's target is none other than Batman's partner, Robin. What makes this book better than the last one is that any other subplot is done away with and focused only on the confrontation except for the inclusion of Mr. Freeze which is felt as done for the sake of the Batman & Robin movie which came out the same year. His appearance in this book would have been unnecessary were it not for his only contribution."
1,Three strikes and out,"This is the 'Batman & Robin' of the trilogy. The bright, gaudy colors, the bad humor, the nonsense, the poor dialogue. Even from an artistic viewpoint this entry seems more like a bad TV-movie compared with the more cinematic first two.The Pred has returned...again...to Gotham City and is once more chopping up bad guys. Batman villains pop in from time to time, do nothing, then disappear again. Other regular characters barely get a look-in or vague reference at best. Bats does virtually no detective work and Robin gets very little to do until the last act. It's all too fast, too familiar, and too shallow. Instead of giving us an epic battle between the two icons (as the title would imply) we just get a bunch of filler scenes and little else.They try to cover up their shortcomings with pathetic attempts at self-referential humor, but to the jaded (wise) reader it just doesn't work.Only buy to finish off your collection. It's certainly ain't no masterpiece."
5,Learn to Snowboard DVD - Boarding Skool,Really enjoyed this DVD. Something I will watch over and over again as I learn to snowboard.
2,Not thorough enough,"I'm in my second year of snowboarding and I checked out this video simply as a refresher. It filled it's purpose to me as a refresher, but that isn't the purpose of the video. This video is for beginners, but it doesn't have enough information for a beginner. Before my first season snowboarding I watched a different video that was very helpful. By comparison I was surprised at the lack of detail in Snowboard Skool. Snowboard Skool spends just a few seconds telling the viewer how to do something then shows one very short example of a rider performing the move. What the video really lacks is covering the underlying concepts of snowboarding. In other words, it only teaches the ""how"" and not the ""why"".I'd recommendFresh start snowboarding. I'll try to add a review of that video too."
5,Very Helpful!,This is a very helpful DVD! I think this dvd would help anyone who was looking to learn how to snowboard. It covers everything that you would need!
5,Nice,I got this ring back in 2007. Its been 2 years now and the ring has 3 stones missing from it. I bought this for $7 so for me to still be able to wear it now is great. Well worth the money
5,I warmly recommend this book,"When I read Lloyd's King book, Amazing ""Aha!"" Puzzles, I had the impression it's one of the best puzzle books ever written. There are very few books involving lateral thinking - for sure, this one does. Lloyd, founder of the Vinci Society, has an incredibly high imagination and creativity. He perfectly summarises his views in his article ""Creative Thinking"" at http://www.ahapuzzles.com/creative_thinking_1.htm."
4,"flimsy, but creative","i have a few sets of these, and while they are innovative, convenient and creative, they are smaller and a bit insubstantial compared with what i expected. but, they're pretty inexpensive so all is not lost."
1,Wretched translation,"This edition was published in the USSR and exported to the west, the goal being to turn people on to ""Soviet"" literature. The translators tried to smooth things out and managed to suck all the life out of the language. Too bad because the printing is hardcover and OK physically. Spend the extra few dollars on a Penguin Classics edition instead of wasting your money."
5,Great Practical Handbook,"As an electrical engineer who has been out of school for a few years, I found this book to be tremendously helpful in covering topics I either never really delved into or only took intro courses on. It provided excellent explanations on both data conversion concepts and the hardware used to realize them. I found the handbook's explanation of device parameter specifications to be incredibly useful, giving the knowledge needed to pick the right part for my job. They also have testing and analysis procedures for different elements and great example circuits. Great book. I definitely recommend it."
1,PHONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The heroic James Carl Taylor of Harrison, Arkansas actually served in the U.S. Navy from April 1969 until April 1973 as a mechanic. His only award was the National Defense Sevice Medal and NO he never went to Vietnam nor was he ever a SEAL. Don't waste your time or money on a wannabe when there are several books written by true veterans of Vietnam."
1,All hpye and nothing else,"This presentation has nothing going for it...Aside from the narrator quoting long passages directly out of scripture,and a few second-rate experts making bold if otherwise speculative statements,this program says very little about where the ark may be,or what may have happened to it..."
3,More Mystery...,"In this program we are introduced to the idea of the Ark of the Covenant being kept safe in Ethiopia. The entire program focuses on how the Ark could have been moved from the Temple to Ethiopia and from that perspective it is fascinating. An understanding of cultural significance evolves and a deeper understanding of a culture still focusing on the Ark of the Covenant may be a surprise to many. If you have any interest in researching this topic, then this will be a brief introduction to a fascinating idea of spiritual significance.~The Rebecca Review"
4,..Just the basics,"If you have no idea of the Lost Ark then this is a ""teaser"", but I had all this info back in the 80s"
3,Not as good as some of Rick Geary's other Victorian murder books,"As always, Rick Geary's art is stupendous, yet as other reviewers have noted, much more could have been done with this graphic novel. The bizarre nooks, crannies, and asphyxiation rooms of H.H.Holmes' castle would have made for a visual feast, but unfortunately Geary focuses on these matters relatively briefly, choosing instead to spend time following Holmes step-by-step as he abandons one wife and child after another and murders his way through most of the children in the Pietzel family. Still, a competent introduction to one of the more horrifying figures of 19th century America."
2,Need Background Information before Reading,After reading Erik Larson's non fictional/fictional Devil in the White City book which received critical praise I decided to look at Rick Geary's pictoral novel. Recommended for children in 8th grade i feel this book fails to deliver alot of the back ground information into the 1893 World Fair nor H.H. Holmes. Instead this book gives anyone interested into learning more about both topics alot of holes in the story making it hard to completly understand H.H. Holmes and his murderous rage he left on Chicago. For those who have background knowledge on this subject thi book acts as a quick refresher. Those looking to know the real story of H.H. Holmes I recommend reading The Devil in the White CIty.
5,The African American Writer,"I highly recommend this book to anyone that currently writing a book and want to know how to craft your works.Telling The Tale that includes plenty advices and lots of helpful resources info to getting your book completed. If you're looking for a great book that would teach you how to write a bestseller book, this book is a must read!"
5,Mr. Jones,To just hear Mr. Jones get busy is a treat! But to see and hear Mr.Jones again...... it's flash-back ectasy. The cats were barking!
3,Good book,"Good book discussing some basic issues facing teachers in multicultural settings (or any setting for that matter).If you are already familiar with the topics covered then it'll be a refresher. If you are oblivious to some of these ideas then this will be a good book for you.This was a required book in my course but I bought the 5th edition as it is nearly identical, they added and removed a nonessential, testing insert for the 6th edition. I saved a lot of money by going with the previous edition which is important for many students."
1,EXTREMELY BIASED,This textbook is very biased against white people and there are many over generalized statements and many data points with no documentation. It is a very Librally written book and I do not recommend it to anyone.
5,Book,"Book arrived when promised. Cost was fair. Just wish the class would have used it more, but that has nothing to do with Amazon. The book was in excellent condition."
3,Book cover and pages were not in the conditioned promised!,"I paid more for this book to get it shipped faster, but I should have waited for a cheaper one in better shape...not very happy!"
1,Dissapointed,"The photo showed a silicone case with a clip, but all that came was a silicone case without a clip. For me it's useless."
5,Another great item from Amazon!!!!,"These cottages are so unique. Each one is different and the details are really special. I was so happy to find this one at Amazon, and will continue to look for others."
3,A revised version is needed,"The book looks neat at first sight and I like its style and organization, suitable for an elementary course in credit risk. But there are so many mistakes in the book, say, pages 28, 49, etc... Those mistakes can be easily avoided by a more careful reading through. In addition, there are few real life examples in the book.A 3rd edition is definitely needed."
5,Excellent fantasy book,"I truly loved this book. The reading was very easy as it is a Young Adult novel. I loved how the story progressed. It didn't get to deep into ""history"" of the allies and their feuds before being made allies. I would have liked to know more about the Holly King and his folks. They never speak and I don't recall Thirrin ever actually seeing the king himself. The book contains humor as well. I'll never forget the ear warmers with tassles on top for Oskan's mule. Hiliarious! I cried when loved ones died and the battles made me try to read faster just so I could see how they turned out. I did feel the ending felt a bit rushed, but that being the only downfall I had with the book couldn't give it a lesser rating. I can't wait to read the 2nd book in the series, I hope it's as good. If you are looking for a good story, fast paced, won't put you to sleep with history or painting the background too much, this is a the book for you."
3,not bad but not great,"I think this book had a lot of potential. It had a decent plot and good characters, but it was pulled off poorly. I agree completely with another reviewer in that the allies seemed to forget about the wars they fought instantly, then lose all sour feelings and act like lifelong friends. It was really unrealistic. It was also quite predictable, shallow, and slow in many areas. However, it was an mildly entertaining read, and is worth reading if you are exceptionally bored."
4,a book u can't put down,"Icemark there kingdom is in trouble there king died in battle.There faith is in a girl's hand. Lindenshield a strong warrior. they must protect the Kingdome for the enemy. for a long time they must find a way to protect the Kingdome she forms a alliance with the snow lepord's,Vampires, Wolf-folk. they are so strong the kingdom is safe."
5,Surprisingly Good,"I read this book expecting just another run-of-the-mill fantasy, but this poignant and surprisingly humorous novel is one-of-a-kind. Though pretty predictable, it is exciting and well-written. I cared about Thirrin after reading a few chapters and the similarities between Thirrin's people and the Vikings were very interesting. I read it last year, when I was twelve, but it could truly be enjoyed by those of all ages."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Books of this size are sometimes difficult to finish. This book just flew by -- and when I had finished, I was so sorry there wasn't more of it! I sure do hope that Stuart Hill is writing another one. I have to know what will happen in the future to Thirrin. I'm 15 years old and if you had told me that I would love this book, I probably would not have believed you. This is a fantastic story about a young princess who must go to war to defend her kingdom. She joins forces with the neighboring countries whose citizens are werewolves, vampires and snow leopards. What's amazing is that this author makes all of this feel incredibly real and believable. This is one fabulous book! Please read it."
2,Slow and disappointing,"I've tried and tried to get into this book . . . the cover and book jacket looked so appealing and I spent so much money on it. But I find it very slow and unexciting. I keep picking it up, hoping the next chapter will be more riveting, but it isn't. The main character is great, however. I really like her. In fact, all of the characters are well developed and interesting. So what's the problem? I think it's because I can always predict exactly what's going to happen. It moves at a slow pace and there are few, if any, unexpected surprises. So I can only give it two stars and call it SLOW and DISAPPOINTING. I bought it for my son, but after reading it myself, I'm not even going to recommend it to him, because I know he'll find it painfully slow and dull."
2,Good idea - doesn't follow through,"The concept and cover reeled me in, the book itself didn't even begin go live up to it. The characters are all flat and lacking any complexity that would make them interesting. Things are glossed over, potential complex feelings, actions, etc. are not followed through on. The author is very good at telling but I seem to remember my 4th grade writing teacher telling us that you should always show, not tell. Show me that the character is struggling with the concept of Wolf-folk having compassion and feelings. Show me the struggle that continues... they don't just become her ally and the entire country is hunky dory. There's conflict there! On the thought of conflict, too much was focused on the ""main conflict"" of the battle scenes and not enough inter-character conflict.Over all, this is an under developed surface story with no real draw other than a good concept."
2,"Too expensive, too tall","I'm an engineer in the construction industry. We print 11x17 all the time. I would like to buy about 10 of these but that would cost me $250... They need to make a cheaper version that doesn't hold so many papers... it only needs to be about 1 inch high not 3 or 4.I have tried making my own, but I don't have very good saws...I have looked all over, but could not find anything..."
3,the tunnel,my son loves this tunnel. I set it up and he runs right up to it. I can put it up and take the two sections and over lap them to make it shrink so he can pull hes cars toy throw it. the dog pokes hes head in and out of the ends and plays with the baby. the only problem is the cost. but for your kids nothing is to much
1,never recieved my study guide for class,"I don't know what happened but this seller never returned my emails. I never recieved the product, never got a reply back, or even a sorry about not getting the item. I really needed this book for class."
4,Fantastic,"Probably one of the best sounding components I've heard in their price range, and some above. You can certainly spend more, but why when these sound as good or better than most, even some of the top, pricey ones."
2,Let down,"This started off well, but then fell off. I figured out ""who done it"" way too early, so the suspense was gone. I did like the characters, oddities all."
1,Liar!!,"Shelby should be ashamed of himself!! He knows he staged these pics...I am a resident of one of the hollers photographed!! I am close personal friends with some of the subjects and they were told what to wear, how to look, where to stand to get the worst possible background. I am from a holler and I am a proud, CLEAN, HARDWORKING, HOLLER DWELLER!! Shame on you for what you have done to your own kin!!"
1,Shameful Stereotyping,Do not buy this book if you care anything about Appalachia and the people who live here. This book is so full of stereotypical images that it is useless as any guide or indicator of the real complexity of life in Appalachia. It is amazing to me that a publisher would continue to publish a book like this one after so much effort has been put into setting the record straight about Appalachia. This book is cultural exploitation at its worst.
2,Leaves much to be desired,"I am a huge fan of gothic literature and theory, and this book was a big disappointment. the author basically rehashes theories which have been espoused, used and overkilled in the late 80s and early 90s. Written in 1999, and with so many new theoretical stuff on the gothic - some of which are incredibly sophisticated - this book just does not make the cut. if one wants a good introduction to gothic in general, one should try Fred Botting's Gothic, or more specifically, if one wishes to read more of the female/feminine gothic, Anne Williams's and Eugenia DeLamottes's books are super. the only worthwhile thing about this book is that the author expands the gothic ""cannon"" (although i dont like this word) to include some canadian writers who have not been regarded as gothicist before (thus the one extra star). but even so, the theorisation really really needs some serious updating. this book references a LOT, but i suspect that the author is merely padding her bibliography."
2,Disappointing misprint mares otherwise useful screen,"Keepers playing Call of Cthulhu from behind a screen are doing it all wrong. They would have a hard time weaving a story with a barrier in the way.However, screens have their uses, mainly as a quick reference for charts and as a means of hiding maps and dice rolls. The ""Call of Cthulhu Keeper's Screen"" does the job just fine, and organizes the charts in a logical manner. The artwork on the front is not great, and could use improvement. It can be distracting to players.The main defect of this screen is the misprint where they did not add the numbers to the ""Strength vs. Resistance"" chart. This is one of the most important charts in the game, and I am gobsmacked that such a major defect made it onto the market.If you are running ""Call of Cthulhu,"" it will be useful to have a screen. Just beware of the limitations."
3,"Good clock, Okay alarm function, Bad radio reception","Pros:- Keeps time- Not too bright, easy to read- Alarm goes off as plannedCons:- Static in all radio stations- Antenna is a flexable wire hanging out the back- To turn the alarm off for the day you have to switch a tiny switch on the right side, off then on again if you want it to wake you the following day."
1,Freud Diablo Ferrous Metal Cutting Blade,"I have used a Freud non-ferrous metal cutting blade for a number of years and have been very happy with it. I have cut pieces of aluminum stock up to 1/4"" with good results.Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the ferrous metal blade. As soon as I made one or two short cuts in a sheet of .030"" mild steel on my table saw, the blade became dull. Further cuts were difficult and resulted in considerable burring.I reported the problem to Freud and they gave me a return authorization. The replacement blade behaved the same way.Based on my experience, I can't recommend the blade."
5,A Great Read!,Loved the book! A book for everyone who loves life and enjoys living it instead of dwelling on past mistakes. Gets to the point and lets you know how to really help yourself. Read the book and start living!
5,A Journey Back To Childhood,"This book took me right back to my childhood. All the memories of growing up in the 40's and 50's came flooding back. It was sweet, simple and fast reading but I kept pausing and thinking of my own memories of those carefree days of childhood.I would recomend it to anyone who grew up in those times and to anyone age nine on up,to give them a look at what life was like back then."
3,JB is stunning!!!!,"Story is a OK, you almost can predict what's gonna happen next, but Jennifer Beals rocks as a rock star in this film, gorgeous and stunning, If you are a JB fan, it's a definite buy."
3,Not very gory but still good!,This is one of the few R.L. Stine books that isn't full of blood. But it was still a good book. I agree with the person ahead of me it's kinda different from the other books. The ending is sad. It's about this girl who is haunted by a ghost that says that the girl killed him. But then she sees the ghost alive. It is a good book.
3,come on rl stine-you can do better,"this book was okay. it wasn't gory at all and there wasn't much of a mystery to solve. the end is quite predictable. as i love the fear street books, i know how good the books can be, and this one isn't near the top of the list. RL Stine CAN do better. but, give this book a go, check this book out 4 yourself."
1,paved the way Albertina Walker,They Needed Pastor Shirley Caesar Badly. They Should Have Begged her to do this album with them
5,Wonderful practice for spirit and mind!,"I bought this Bible years ago, and use it as my everyday Bible. I read along in Spanish as the pastor reads in church, and continually increase my vocabulary. I also use this Bible to give my students verses in Spanish and allow them to tell me where it's found, or what the verse is in English. A must have for any Spanish library!Even for my little ones, they love to hear and repeat Genesis 1:1 after doing their Flip Flop Spanish workbook."
3,Easy to follow,"Layout makes going from version to version fairly simple.Suggestions: a large or giant print version. Reading in different languages could be made simpler if the print is easier to read, making it much easier to follow. Older people using this Bible will find it particularly difficult to read.It's better for personal study where good lighting is easier to access."
5,Excellent resource book for every aspect of angora rabbits.,This book is absolutely outstanding for the serious spinner and for those who raise angora rabbits for their wool. There is much information I was unable to find anywhere else.
4,"""an apparent dud"" is wrong","Followup report: A second battery still wouldn't make the pocket PC work. As a last resort, I restored the Axim to it's original state - reformating and reinstalling everything. Magically, the power problem went away. While there was no apparent indication of power usage like WiFi running, there was apparently after five years of life something wrong that only reformatting and reinstalling the entire operating system could fix. Sorry for the initial complaint -- I think there was more going on than just the battery."
3,Unique view,"Young Yakuza is that unique blend of reality show and Godfather-esque drama. An insightful look at the underworld of Japan and how the modern world has changed the world of the Japanese Mafia.There is an oddness to the relationship between young Naoki and the mob boss Kumagai is an odd one, but touching at the same time. Perhaps it takes a foreign director, in this case French auteur Jean-Pierre Limosin, to have the objectivity to tell this story in this manner."
1,bad recipes,"the recipes in this book are horrendous, i'd advise against such a purchase. The recipes for chicken also make my taste buds sing off-key. A hint of parsley does not always make the difference in the way something tastes, and I'm glad I only borrowed this book from a friend!"
1,disgusting and amazingly fatty foods. A NO NO NO book!!,"If you want a book full of non-fat, tastey recipes DO NOT buy this book. I had tried many things to lose weight and become thin again so I could surf, this book made it worse! I hated the food I was eating and turned to more fatty foods such as pizza or fries, all of you that have dieted know what I'm talking about. Don't base your decision on my review, read good and bad before you say No to this book!!"
5,My favorite cookbook,"Ever since I bought this cookbook, it has been a staple in my kitchen. Not only are the recipes easy to follow and easy to eat(!), but the book is very informative in and of itself. I have learned many shortcuts that I never knew. A definite winner!"
4,Pretty cool.,"So I bought this obviously and I think that it looks cool by itself. But with the whole collection, it's awesome! The spider-man that comes along with it does not have the stand that it look like in the picture so that just pretty much sucks. But overall it's something nice to have."
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE!,This viedo is not worth the price. The tape has very little info about how to do it your self. It goes step by step of how to do the cocker cut. If you want to just clip or comb your cocker it has no info on how.
5,A Good Book,"Tuck Everlasting, best book that's a yes. It was a book about a girl that found a family that could live foever called"" the Tucks"" she thought they had been kidnapped by them. But became friends with them and she helped to protect a dangerous secret,magic water!!!By Dan"
5,Stink's Review,"I liked the book a lot because they lived forever and they never died. That would be really cool to live forever because u can't die, never get hurt, and always be alive. I also like it because they all where really nice to each other and they helped each other."
2,"Not coherent, not for beginners","I had high hopes for this book, and it certainly contains a massive amount of information. Unfortunately, for the person who is new to Linux, you will easily get lost, as there are few definite directions. What there is, instead, are summaries, histories, and bits of advice, which don't always hang together.The book does have useful information - but if you're looking for an A-B-C installation guide, this isn't it."
3,"Excellent author, dated book","Too bad the author has not chosen to release updated versions in America, as apparently has been done in Europe. He is one of the clearest writers I've read on the topic of Linux. But the book was published in 1997! Linux, unlike Windoes, has been transforming at lightening speed. The Linux desktop of today is nothing like the Linux desktop of 1997. So about 40 percent of the book is of historical interest, but scarcely relevant today. The other 60 percent, however, is exceptional. I wish all authors were as lucid in their thinking and writing."
4,A Must Have for new Linux Users,"Contains information down to the features of a specific file system. Is not specific to one distirubtion, but offers comments about how the distirutions differ on particular topics. Unfourtunatly it only includes information on RedHat up to v4.1 but the information still applies to v5.1.Doesn't pretend to be the end all to Linux documentation. Just a very good begining."
3,Replacement batteries,"I found that the replacement batteries are not the same quality as the original Sony ones that came with the camera. The back keeps falling off this one, but it charges and I can still use my camera. I guess that's what's important."
2,Disappointing,"This book had a poor coverage for places outside the the trendy tourist spots. Having toured Japan on three occasions, I found that its suggested accommodations seem to be for non-budget travellers and its itineraries were very limited. Of all the guides on Japan, I found this the easiest to put down."
2,Out of date,"Unfortunately, this book is extremely out-of-date and needs to be seriously updated in order to be useful in Japan today."
3,Temptations Wings of Love Album,"The sound quality was poor, reflecting a used LP. It was very disappointing. I wanted this album a lot because it has some good songs, but I have only listened to it once. Lots of scratches on side two. It was listed as new by the seller. Had I known it was used I would not have been surprised by the quality. Let's be truthful, OK!"
3,Insightful and entertaining,"Robert Rodriguez's journal-style entries detailing his journey to making El Mariachi were interesting, especially with the knowledge of its success. Many of his ideas were helpful, and he gave the reader an idea of how hard he worked. However, I wished that Robert would go into further detail about his inspiration for the story, why he shot scenes in a certain way, what angles he found effective in certain scenes, etc. Also,with the increasing usage of digital camcorders, many of his money-saving tips are not so relevant."
5,INSPIRATION FOR ALL FILMMAKERS,I found this book to be very inspiring. Rodriquez tells his story with a lot of humor. After finishing this book I felt like I could make a film and to hell with whoever stood in my way. I whole-heartedly recommend this book.
4,informitve and fresh.i wanted to go out and make my own film,"From start to finish this bookhad my attention.from the start the auther tell his story of being a lab ratto make money for his first film. to the end of filming andthe time spend on the road trying to sell the film, he walksyou through his fast pace aventure and you live it withhim day by day acount this is writen in diary form.it is a fast read and well worth the education for futerfilm writers and buffs alike."
5,"Funny, smart and humorously smart aleck!","This is a wonderfully engaging book! It is written like a diary and as such I didn't feel like I had to complete the chapter in order to get the information in tangible pieces.Funny, smart and humorously smart aleck! A real window into the process from start to finish!""Rebel Without A Crew"" has inspired me to go film anything once a week with a friend. We just go out find something and then shoot it - of course we spend the rest of the day thinking of other places to go the next week! We edit our video during the week and show what we came up with with the same material.We discuss screenplays and documentaries we'd like to do as well as movies and shows we should see during the week."
4,up-lifting view on pursuing one's dreams to create,"The text was so fast paced and interesting it was hard to put down. The writing style enables the reader to experience the obstacles and relate to the situations he finds himself in. The motivation Rodriguez has for filmmaking was so inspiring. It is a definite reader for anyone who has a dream to be creative but is afraid. His confidence is exuberant and inspirational. It reminded me of how important it is to have ""ganas"" - a will to accomplish. His writing and experiences speak to the Chicano/Latino experience of optimism and the familiarity of one's own resources. I will definitely recommend his book to students. Adelante con tu pasion."
1,Indie film makers can get all the info for free--I am glad to see the rate reduced,"(now I am glad to see the rate reduced)His achievements are phenomenal and are an inspiration to all indie film makers NO QUESTIONS about that but guys we all know his story.The reviews forced me to purchase a new copy though my gut feeling, after reading a few pages on the Amazon, said this will be it in his book--but I made the mistake of buying it.He doest give enough tips about film making all he says is his brief experiences before and during the making of E.M and elaborate details while selling and promoting his film.This book has 285 pages of which 75 pages are his screenplay for El Mariachi which can be downloaded for free online.The 10 minute Film School part consists of 14 pages---this can be seen on You Tube or his DVD of E.M.Better still to buy his DVD rather than this book."
4,"Not a filmmaking book, but a clever approach","What Rodriguez did was great because he took the crappiest approach and suceeded. Well i still cant believe it but it sure happened. the film wasnt any good but Thanks to Rodriguez, we all now know that hollywood needs to invest in a brain and that anything goes. Well this is why you got to love good old hollywood and the uneducated people that it holds. It would be nice if rodriguez made a good film for a change."
5,Toss the 'status quo' to the wind!,"Thank God this was the first book I read about independent filmmaking! The book was inspiring, motivating and takes away all the stops we have in our mind about filmmaking. It's funny, satirical, sarcastic and immeasurably exact. If you want to make a movie - go make a movie! That's it!I'm a writer so planning has been engraved into my left-brain even though my right-brain wants to go with the flow! But RR's book has taught me to have a ""devil may care"" attitude about the typical Hollywood way of filmmaking and JUST DO IT!Robert Rodriguez is a man who's ""devil-may-care"" approach to filmmaking AND his jack-of-all-trades character launched him into superstardom. His filmmaking results are duplicate-able. So you wanna be a filmmaker? Fine...you ARE one...so go make business cards!!"
5,Solid,Great book flew through it in a week. Not a strong reader but it made me turn the pages. I wish I didn't buy the suggested book 304 film maker
5,Must have book,This is a gem that can inspire and help you down the path of filmmaking. Be inspired and get filming.
5,Excellent Rebel Without A Crew; Robert Rodriguez,"I loved reading ""Rebel Without A Crew"" because it was so inspirational! I may have fallen in love with Robert Rodriguez and his Mariachi style of shooting movies. My Spanish teacher recommended me to watch El Mariachi and to learn about Robert Rodriguez and so I ordered the book and I could not put it down. The book is wonderful. Robert seems very friendly, humble, and intelligent. I just ordered the double feature Blue-Ray of ElMariachi/Desperado and I absolutely cannot wait to watch the movies. This book is totally recommended to those who want to make movies without going to film school or money because it can be done. ""...be scary."""
4,Inspiring,"A great inspiring book! I personally don't like the genre of most of his movies, although I enjoyed watching Once upon a time in Mexico, but I believe he's an extremely talented artist full of imagination and creativity and he deserves the success he's been having so far. Although it's a very inspiring book, whether you're a film maker who's trying to break through or not, I don't think anyone could have pulled it off like he did: you need a lot of talent, creativity and versatility and basically being a genius. But for sure it inspires you to put your talent to work and think outside the box which is a great starting point for any path you want your life to be headed to. Hat's off to Robert Rodriguez."
5,Celluloid in my blood!,"Rodriguez never ceases to amaze me. This is, by far, the most inspirational book on modern independent filmmaking that I've ever read. He simply leaves the mechanics of the art behind and gets right to the soul of it. The diary is a clear illustration of this man's personal triumph in an industry filled with closed doors. Robert Rodriguez not only tells his own story in a fast-paced, exciting style, he actually motivates the reader to get out there and make movies as well. It is evident that this man's passion is film. I am still amazed at how strongly he's able to channel that passion straight into the reader's bloodstream. Rebel Without A Crew is a definite must-read for anyone even remotely interested in producing films. If this veritable shot of motion picture-making adrenaline doesn't move you to action, you don't belong in the business! Read it, love it, live it!!!"
5,Rebel Withou A Crew,This book is very good. It is encouraging and helpful to any young film maker like myself. I highly recommend it. It's worth the money.
3,Interesting insight into a very talented man,"A great tale, but not so well written that I could recommend on its literary quality alone. I admire Rodriguez - even more, knowing what he went through to make this film (and I'm a fan El Mariachi more than the overly-produced Once Upon a Time in Mexico). The story-telling reflects his jagged style. At the very least, it should inspire you to make a few sacrifices in favor of pursuing one of your own dreams."
3,Without a Crew?,This book is mostly a tale about making a particular film. It is entertaining but it lacked the nitty gritty details I was hoping for.
4,Inspirational story,"Recounts the making of ""El Mariachi"". Interesting story told through a Journal. If you want to make films but just can't get started, read this book. It gives you the motivation to do it with whatever equipent you have. Likeable guy, good book!"
4,bang for the buck,I am totally satisfied with this product and the seller. I would sure buy more from this seller.
2,Did not work for me,"After reading several reviews i decided to buy this product.I thought i had finally found a solution to my razor bumps,but that was not the case.After my initial shave with the razors i thought it was good but subsequent shaves made me realise i was better off with my depilatories."
5,great blades,"Used them fo 10 years great for bald heads. Safe on your skin with no nicks or abrasions, grea blades for keeping you smooth."
5,good price for AZ,it is really hard for me to find the refill paks where i live. I got a great deal and didn't have to search all over town for them:)
4,Great Product for African Americans,This product works great. Been using it for almost 4 years now and I have nothing but rave reviews for it. try it.
5,Does what it's advertised to do!,"Very close shave, no nicks,razor-burn or bumps. Reasonable price, for a quality product. TRY IT!!"
1,"love book, hate spacing","I love my paperback and was excited to see an ebook. Each kindle page holds only about three lines, or six, if you turn it long view. Frustrating. Totally kills the mood to keep turning pages."
1,no bang for the buck,With no figures nor mathematical expression this document is worthless. The 10 $ I spent could have been better used.
3,Solid,Good compilation from Renegade Hardware. The track selection is good but the problem is that whenever I listen to the Cd I always wish my cd had a pitch controller so I could speed it up. I give the people involved with Renegade hardware props for not buying into the garbage style of jump up drum and bass. Future cut remix of the code is I think the best track on the cd with Dorway by Usual Suspects second best. If you need to be aquainted with rough Drum and Bass this is the ticket. I think that Armegeddon 2 is much better though (its two mix cds by Future Cut and Usual Suspects).
1,Plastic Hoops,I purchased these hoops for my two year old daughter. I was unable to find these size hoops in a smaller quantity online anywhere. I am very disappointed that each hoop is stapled together by three very large staples. The staples feel sharp and protrude from the hoops. I have seen other small plastic hoops like this at my daughter's movement/music classes. Those hoops were not stapled together. I would not purchase anything from this merchant again.
1,"Yea right, practice?","I bought this book to practice some general math skills for a civil service exam, well would`nt you know it the math that existed on the exam was nothing like in this book. The charts were not the same on the exam and the word problems are far to easy than on the actual exam, when I first bought this book I thought it would be a great help for me, but it can not be used as a good source of info."
4,Written in a plain English Style,"I have been teaching print reading for over 4 years, & this is my required text. Print Reading for Construction is written in a very plain English style and works very well in diverse classroom settings. In addition, this text provides a great deal of sample building plans for sharpening your skills."
3,"Print Reading for Construction, 9781590703472",This is sold as a package in campus bookstores for college curriculum programs. The package includes a write-in workbook and a large folder with 116 prints for around $59.25. If you are going to need this for a class you better make sure both the book and prints are included in the purchase. Be sure what looks like a deal is not a waste of money and time.
3,Not as advertised ( no spiral bound anything),"No Spiral bound as advertised, a lot of folded drawings in a folder! No Book included like the one I used to have. same photo on Cover,don't let that fool you, all you get is a lot of blueprints.and NO Spiral Bound instructional book. or anything spiral bound!"
2,Not impressed,"I have been in the field where I read blueprints all the time. There are a lot of words that are not defined in this book and had to rely on the internet to retrieve them. The blueprints that come along with this book are sometimes blurry and hard to read. This book is just OK to get an idea of how to read blueprints for the beginners in any mechanical or trade, but you will be searching for information as you come across it. It won't be in the book. There must be better ones out there."
3,Missing,"Print Reading for Construction is actually a well written book witheffective definitions and drawings. However, it seams the books is sold new as a set. So if you buy used you may not get the Print supplement sheets or maybe not even the spiral bound book like another review mentions. Missing Vital information makes it pretty useless in the end."
1,Wrong Book,I have ordered this book here once before and I have received a wrong book(it looks completely the same but the teacher's manual
1,Ridiculous,This is ridiculous...it's missing pages and it was brand new. & I have yet to hear back from someone!
3,Buy another brand,"got one of these for my Honda Element and it was delivered in time by Summit Racing by UPS and that was well.The box it was in, was for a about 12"" longer than it needed to be and didn't have any paper or filler to absorb shock. No pieces in box.Thats ok though, they shipped from the factory one that was shorter on one side. I had to cut the other side down.So if you looking for Quality Control, buy from someone else besides Ventshade or Lund Co."
4,Excellent throwback,"This movie is better than you likely expect and benefits from a controlled running time and some really good lines. Although made within the past two years, it feels like a movie from the 80's VHS era. It does well in avoiding overly long scenes or focus on superfluous details that would only pad the movie's length (pitfalls other small budget movies seem to run into). The pacing is kept tight and the movie doesn't overstay it's welcome."
5,great and beautiful paint by number set,received the set in a timely manner and it has given me many hours of satisfaction. the painting turned out beautifully. thanks.
5,Easy to do and pretty too,"Bought this for Husband who is ill, he loves the Dimension paint by numbers and they really do finish up very nicely. I have lost count but I think this one is #4 he has finished."
4,Minor flaws,This is a really great product for painters. It will surely keep you busy for awhile. The only downside is they don't give you enough paint for certain areas and some of the paint is clumpy. Other than that this is a over all great product.
2,I receive it dirty!,"I ordered this item using my friend's amazon account because that time I don't have an account here. When the item arrived, I've noticed that it has a lot of dust on it and it's dirty. It seems its not brand new as what it was advertised here."
4,A worthy successor to Lightfoot.,"What is it about Canadian songwriters? They must have something in the water up there that spawns great music and lyrics. Here's another one to join the ranks of Gordon Lightfoot, Joanie Mitchell, Ian Tyson, Leonard Cohen, David Francey, et al. James not only composes great stuff but sing them very well in a rich baritone voice. His guitar playing is simple and lends great support to his music. Gotta get it!"
2,"Handy, but not durable. 2nd starter broken already","It's a great piece of equipment... when not broken. As noted by another reviewer, the pull start gears are plastic. This is the dumbest design I can think of, it's bound to fail. Dig a few holes adn start a few times, the gears wear - or break. Worn and start slipping. Broken, won't catch at all. Either way, it's not designed for longevity. The first time I returned it, I had to debate to get it exchanged. Now I haven't used it much - but has been too long since purchase to return. so I have to find a replacement set of starter gears? Bogus!! Good product with a crappy design on a very critical part. I'd love the thing if I wasn't on 2nd broken one. As it stands, I'm very disappointed."
3,Wobbly..,"We screwed the top pocket into the wall and attached the rest of the kit. There are some little side thingies (you'll know them when you see them .. they're the things you look at and wonder what good they do) that don't stay put, and they kept falling off. Eventually the cats got to them before we did and who knows where they are. Fortunately they appear to be entirely non-structural. The contraption has fallen apart a couple of times when we've bumped into it, it's not the sturdiest thing out there. I was hoping it would come as a fused unit, but it does not. However, we have decided to keep it because if all else fails each pocket can be individually screwed into the wall. Not what we wanted, but we'll see."
4,More Than Satisfied,"My wife sometimes needs to fan for a minute or two. I decided to replace all those cardboard on tongue depressor type fans with something a little more elegant. The box full of expandable fans was just the ticket. These things are not built to withstand a nuclear blast, but the quality is more than adequate for this use. They seem to open better in one direction than the other, but it's just a guess whether or not you have that right when you open one. Folding is a little stiff, but with a little care, they fold up just fine. So, my wife now has a fan in her purse, next to every chair, and in the car, by the bed, and a few spares. For those emergency moments, the fans are exactly what was needed."
4,great for an art project,Pros: it's made of paper and wood so it's easy for kids to draw on and get creative making their own designs.Cons: it does not open smoothly. You kind of have to guide the folds a little bit. Not fancy. basic fan.We had great time coming up with nature inspired designs and although the paper got wet (we used paint) the fans worked well after they dried up.
2,Not what I was hoping for,I was really looking for good quality fans to handpaint for myself. These are fine for children to draw on but not what I wanted. The wood is not sanded well and the paper doesn't have the almost cloth like feel I had hoped for.
4,Useful,The fans are good and handle some powerful use and give plenty of wind for comfort and the simplicity and bamboo is exatly what i needed
3,"Yeah, ok","The authors made a case for the determination of some people and organizations to bring down the Clintons, while seemingly not devoting much time to the culpability of the Clintons themselves to shoot themselves in their collective foot. There was plenty of blame to go around, but this book did source and explain some of the forces at work to undermine the Clinton tenure. Did this go way beyond bad losers, forgeting that we need to work togther as a people or was it, after all, simply politics, as usual ?"
1,"A Partisan Apology, Little Else","Conason has spent years attempting to defend Bill Clinton, and finally got a book deal for his loyal soldiering.Most of us are well aquainted with the history of his impeachment and have formed our own opinions regarding it. The best objective (and first-hand) account of the subject remains Schippers' ""Sell Out.""With respect to their efforts to affix blame for what led to the impeachment, it must have been a huge embarrasment for the authors to have their highly contrived bit of finger-pointing undermined so soon after this book's publication: by Bill's Pardongate and Hillary taking the White House silver (""gifts!"" she cried). There is no right wing conspiracy, Mr. Conason - just rough and tumble politics, played by both sides. ""The enemy is us,"" says the old saw.This book is of no historical merit - it is only for hard-core Democratic partisans needing to salve their damaged psyches."
2,Cast of players with bios greatly needed,"For the Washington and Arkansas ""outsider"", this was a very difficult book to read. In striving for accuracy and detail, the authors lost me with continual references to names. I managed to read approx 5 chapters but grew tired (unfortunately, for I was greatly interested) from creating my own list of characters and the parts they played. I will probably persevere and finally finish the book, however it was disappointing in this regard."
1,Dixie mafioso flack,"Hate speech from a well known flack for the Dixie mafia. Incredible apologist for crime and corruption. Do your own research. Google keywords Clinton tainted blood and draw your own conclusions, to cite just one example."
1,What You Don't Know CAN Hurt You,"When I saw the latest hatchet job by Gene Lyons - who is a Clinton fan who has written a weekly column for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for years - I knew it would be worth a good laugh. Lyons is a fiction writer and this is unquestionably his most fictitious work. Let's consider what Mr. Lyons wants us to believe:1. That the GOP knew back in the 1980s that Clinton would get elected President not once but twice. This of course was why they tried to make sure he'd win the nomination. Yeah, makes sense to me.2. That lying under oath is okay if you're a Democratic President. I guess it isn't REALLY lying if you don't know what the definition of ""is"" is.3. That Clinton is virgin clean. If he thinks so, he needs to go ask Billy Dale, Linda Tripp, Richard Mellon Scaife, and Kenneth Starr about ""hunting.""This book - in terms of accuracy - can be used to two things. Either as a prominent fiction work.....or as a nice doorstop."
5,Stunning Research,"The authors did a stunning job of digging out background info and following up on each rumor, charge, etc. leveled at the Clintons over ten years. This book is worth every cent paid. Why is it not on the best-seller list?"
2,apologist view of life,"Once again the reader is subjected to an author deciding what the ""truth"" is going to be and then presenting a series of half-truths and obfuscations rendering any hope of objectivity on serious matters impossible. The author appears to be trying to present so much information that one will be tired of the whole mess and only accept their word as to what constitutes fact. This has the fortunate effect of making the book so lethargic that only the most hate-filled liberal would be able to stay awake for more than a few pages"
1,What they want you to believe,The conspiracy theory was just that. How gullible can one be?!History will play this one out.
1,Revisionist nonsense,"I really tried to give this book a fair reading but it is so full of inaccuracies and such a rehash of the same old arguments for the the Clintons' innocence that it basically should not have been written. While there were many people out to get the Clintons', that is true of any modern president. The fact is they ran the most SUCCESSFULLY duplicitous administration of modern times. As evidence of their culpability continues to trickle out slowly, it has been impossible to create the kind of scandal reaction one would expect. This book does nothing to defend the Clintons'sordid behaviour in any new way. Same old excuses. The book explaining all this has not yet been written."
1,The Blind Using Self Created Confusion To Hide The Truth!,"When any many lies under oath in a sexual harrassment case, it is perjury, not hunting anyone. When any man can't remember details but has the vision to know people in the Travel Office have committed a crime, but found innocent by a jury in 2 hours, well that dog can't hunt! When one is accused of being trailer park trash, isn't the man with her made from the same garbage?Sorry, after reading false reports about how Reagan slept in the Oval office, that an unproven October Surprise never happen, and J. Edgar Hoover wore women's underwear, all reported in the main stream press.It is hard to believe this book of confusion that only shows as real stories row in the media. When te media is fair and unbias to all, it will win its reputation back. However, a book like this is nothing short of revisionism, excuse making and magical slight of hand writing as well as poor research.Just The Facts, Madamn. This book has few of them!"
5,Vast Right Wing Conspiracy,"Despite the unfortunate fact that Clinton did in fact have something inappropriate with Monica, it remains that all the millions of dollars spent investigating him came up with nothing. There was a vast, right wing conspiracy, and this book demonstrates how wide spread and how thin or non-existent the evidence was suggesting anything actual wrong-doing by the Clintons.And the negative reviewer on page one is misleading in his review. The authors don't focus on rich white guys. The primary mudslingers in Arkansas were not rich at all, although they wanted to be. It's almost like he didn't read the book."
5,I Lived To See It! ....,"Many thanks to Conason and Lyons for this incredibly enlightening 300 plus pages! I'm reading it for the second time and ""enjoying"" it more... The waiting seemed endless ..but the final product is a gem of the highest caliber.. with proper sourcing and worthy of a Pulitzer for investigative reporting! ... Thank you GL and JC... More?..."
1,The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year Campaign to Dest,"The authors assume that only rich, and republican national leadership tried to destroy Bill Clinton. There were some democarts that felt extremely ill of Clinton and they were not segregationist. I personally felt digust when he was nominated as a presidential canidate. The governor he replaced had placed the state above thirty-five rating of states in employment, eduction, lack of poverty, income per capita, state economicial growth. When Bill Clinton ran for the presidency, Arkansas was 47th a below in all these catagories. People let him off when brushed this question off look what I had to work with. He had a lot more than he left. It is a crime that this man became the leader of this country which he failed at also in my viewpoint."
1,Popular in West Palm Beach?,I see this book is popular in West Palm Beach Florida - isn't that where the idiots couldn't figure out how to correctly fill out an election ballot?? Now that explains this books popularity there......!!
3,An excellent effort to further obscure the obvious,"The 3 stars are for the effort and literary skills Mr. Conason. The book swamps the reader with details and minutiae apparently intended to muddle up and shroud the obvious corruption of the Clintons. It's a common defense strategy (O.J. trial, Warren Commission) to distract the audience with so many unanswered questions, questionable motives, conflicts of interest and possible conspiracies that the forest becomes obscured by the trees (O.J. is guilty, Oswald could not do the shooting, Bill and Hillary have - at the very least - lied under oath and to the American people repeatedly. I will never understand how the prosecutors shortcomings or questionable activities should result in the exoneration of the perpetrator. I'm talking about things outside the courtroom. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' or 'Ken Starr representing a tobacco company' does not excuse the Clinton crimes nor does it provide some moral high ground for any criminal. Thank you."
1,Old Tricks,Conason is up to his old tricks as a big time Clinton defender. They have been working this act for years. Since good old Arkansas days. Don't fall for it!
4,OCZ 1GB Digital Dual,"I've had an OCZ 1GB SD Dual for a few years now and have had very few, if any issues with it. It has worked well as both an SD card which I have used in cameras and PocketPCs and as a USB drive in my laptops and work desktop. The only issue I've had is that it doesn't seem to connect in one of my usb port extenders which has a slightly larger slot but other than that I have preferred it to the SanDisk 1 GB Dual I purchased more recently which seems to have power regulation issues on certain computers.Perhaps the less positive reviews are based on the 2 GB OCZ Dual but as for the 1 GB I would highly recommend it ... maybe I just got lucky.One thing I prefer about the SanDisk SD though is the flip-over cover which you can't lose. I've had a few close calls when I've misplaced the OCZ removable metal plate which isn't actually attached to the card like the SanDisk."
2,Ceased to function as an SD memory card,"The combination SD / USB made it very convenient to take pictures and easy to transfer them to my computer.But the SD card feature stopped working after fewer than three weeks, and it was no longer recognized by any SD device I tried it with. Some other reviews suggest this could be a common issue with OCZ flash cards in general.Its USB port still works, so the card was salvageable as an ordinary USB flash storage device. I've tried a different brand combo SD / USB card (Sandisk) which has been much more dependable."
4,Wonderfully Subtle,"Some of the linked stories in this collection were better than others. Freida is Colored in South Africa and becomes the (fat) girl who does well and goes to a private school and later to England. I loved the details - particularly the subtle, non-explaining ways in which Wicomb addresses Apartheid. (sometimes, though, I wanted a little bit of telling to explain some things and make them clearer)In the final story, Freida is about to have a story collection published, which perhaps means that we can assume there is much autobiography here. Freida/Wicomb feels both shame and guilt and a reluctant love for who she is and where she comes from. And she so wonderfully shows, in the most subtle of ways, how hair is a major political issue for people of color."
1,Disappointed,"Petsport Tuff Balls 2 PackThese balls are not tough at all. My husband purchased the two-pack thinking they would provide entertainment for our German Shepherd pup. In the beginning it was ok, but within an hour she tore the outter part and it started shredding. I noticed green pieces (shreddings) throughout the house. Later that night, she began to vomit and those same shreddings were present. After some TLC the next morning she was fine.I thought maybe is was a fluke ball. So a couple of weeks later I grabbed the other ball just to play catch, where I could monitor her use of the ball. But as puppies do, she somehow got a hold of it and the same thing happened. So I am convinced these balls are no good.I was trying to find the company to issue a complaint, but their website is not functional. So I will call, send an email, and send a letter."
1,tuff? please.,"this aren't anywhere near ""tuff"". after 20 minutes of routine play our pointer mix had destroyed one. Guess we'll have to find something else for her to play fetch with."
1,disappointing,"These balls didn't last as long as regular Wilson tennis balls. It took 2 days for my dog to destroy the first ball. I gave the second one, hoping it was just a fluke, but she knew just how to break it open and this time it only lasted about an hour. The old tennis balls that a neighbor gave us are still fine and much bouncier. Save your money."
2,"Not ""tuff"" at all",Sadly these balls are not tough at all. I had them only a week before they were shredded. My dog only played with the balls at the beach. We would play fetch but he was not allowed to play with them unattended. I bought them because they were made in the USA and they were non toxic. I wish they would have lasted longer. I will not purchase them again.
1,Tuff? Seriously?,"Bought these in the hopes that they would last longer than the normal Wilson/Penn tennis balls I was buying. My dog breaks through normal tennis balls within a day, generally. These ""Tuff"" balls last about 20 minutes. Another problem is that once they break, they leave bigger chunks of rubber behind than a regular tennis ball, which would concern me with smaller dogs and potential intestinal issues from swallowing. In short, these things are a waste of your money. Buy regular tennis balls and save your money. By the way, this is a Mini Golden Doodle we're talking about, not a Doberman."
1,Not tuff enough,"I purchased a two pack of these balls for my dogs - 1 husky, 1 husky sheppard mix. Within 3 days both balls were cracked open, and within 3 more days the felt was ripped open. Regular tennis balls last longer. I will not be buying these again."
1,NOT TUFF AT ALL!,"I really should have included a picture of what my dog did to this ball within minutes of opening the package. They are not ""tuff"". They are slightly thicker then the average tennis ball. If your dog shows no interest in chewing tennis balls this is the ball for you. I had hoped it would last at least a few weeks."
3,"They aren't miracle balls, but they last longer than tennis balls","My 100 pound Italian Spinone chews tennis balls the way 13 year old girls chew gum. Oh, he'll chase them halfheartedly, but once he gets to them he does some SERIOUS munching on them. The problem is, he really won't play with ANY balls except tennis balls (and I've tried a LOT of ball substitutions, believe me). I've literally seen him destroy a tennis ball in 10 minutes.He likes these as well as ""normal"" tennis balls, but they will usually last us through several play sessions before he cracks them. And, even once they are cracked, the felt will sometimes take a couple of more days before it is destroyed, meaning that I can sometimes get a week out of one of these balls. Not great, but much better than the regular tennis balls.If you are looking for a ball that cannot be destroyed, look further because this is NOT it. But, for our house it's a pretty good compromise."
5,Best Bra EVER!,"I have bought this style off and on over the years and liked it, but the tapestry fabric would tear and the straps would slide out of adjustment. With this new and improved styling Olga got it all right. The microfiber sides are supper comfortable and durable; the new straps stay right where you adjust them. I bought three more! This is my bra from here on out!"
5,Olga Tapestry Minimizer - always the best.,Love love LOVE these bras. The fit is always excellent and the straps never fall down. So there ya go. Buy yours today!
4,Quality Product,"This is a quality product but it did not meet my need. It is a very good thumb and wrist support, but not practical for me when working on a keyboard. I recommend the product and the seller."
2,poor fit for me - maybe fine for you - good reason to shop for this in person,"The palmar stay bends too near the end, so the brace doesn't come up high enough on the hand, which makes the point where the thumb restraint pushes in right on my thumb joint. You can take out the palmar stay, but I had to leave it in hot water for a minute to bend it some, and still not right."
5,divine influence,"Karen Casey has been a part of my life since '83 through her daily meditation book, ""Each Day a New Beginning"". She has inspired me to laugh, cry and to ponder the possibilities. Her newest book, ""The Miracle of Sponsorship"", is an inspiration! She has encouraged me again to grow and stretch myself even further on my road to recovery. The insight of her collection of stories reminds me there are many paths I can take to achieve a balance in my life. There are many people out there struggling same as myself. Each one with stories of how they survived. All I have to do is to reach out. Sponsors have been a significant part of my life, whether I was aware of them or not. Karen has helped me to appreciate their importance in my life. I will never be alone on this road again. Thanks Karen for being one of those people. For giving me the hope that I need every day of my life!"
3,The roasting pan would get five stars if....,"it had a better or thicker non stick coating and the outer coating wouldn't scratch so easily.The handles are great, they don't stick out, the pan can handle a 17-20lb turkey, but the exterior aluminum coating scratches very easily. The inside of the pan isn't aluminum or steel, but rather a thin layered non stick coating. You can't use sharp forks or knives, it will nick the coating."
5,A must-have for candle lovers!,"I love the fact that I can extinguish my all-natural soy candles without the collection of soot build-up. This helps me to keep my environment clean at home and work and prevents a smokey experience for each use. I liked it so much I tried to by another, but sob--it was no longer available :("
5,Tape measure,"Great for measuring long distances, flexible, easy to use, longest tape I could find without going to a digital gadget."
2,"Good concept, but....","The concept is great. But the implementation needs work. No matter how tight I keep the top part of the sock, overnight it starts to slip down. This removes the tension on the toe and thus makes it useless. But if you're body allows the top to stay up this will work well."
1,Painful by design,When adjusted for proper foot position it bends your toes backwards. Gets rather painful after a few minutes. Would be better if the tether attached in the ball region instead of at the tips of the toes.
4,some help,"Seemed to really be great the first night, but then made my knee hurt. Haven't wanted to wear it since."
1,Weird,"This was a strange feel while sleeping. Tight around top of foot, slipped slightly and didn't seen to have enough support"
1,Made it worse,"Using this sock made the pain in my foot and ankle worse, not better. I would not recommend it. It was way to big too. It just did not work right."
1,Strassberg sock,"Although this product was recommended by my physical therapist for plantar fasciitis, I am 5'2"" tall with short legs. The strassberg sock did not fit me well. It cut off circulation to my lower leg and I had to stop using it. I cut the elastic on the top of the sock and it still cut off my circulation. I am not sure how it could fit people who are larger than I am. I do not have large calves. There needs to be a way to adjust the elastic and a sock to fit shorter people. It was also difficult for me to adjust to get the proper stretch in my foot. Although I had problems with the brace I got at my podiatrist's office, I wound up continuing to use that one. I think the Strassberg sock might be ok for taller people, but it definitely did not work for me."
3,"Six Months Later, Still Have Plantar Fasciitis","I've been using this nightly for six months. It certainly helps -- one the rare instances I've not worn it (due to travel, etc.) I've had more pain or tenderness the next day. However, it hasn't been a cure for the underlying injury, at least not for me (and I've also been doing twice daily stretching and tissue massage). Fine for what it is, but don't expect miracles. It's reasonably comfortable and easy to adjust, and seems durable."
4,Strassburg Sock,"Pretty comfortable and you can actually sleep with it!After using the prescribed boot, it does not work as well as the boot that the doctor prescribed but when you need to sleep you can substitute this for the boot and get some relief from plantar faschiatis. It definately stretches you out so that you don't have the pain the mornings."
2,"Didn't fit well, uncomfortable","This sock was recommended by my physical therapist, but it was quite uncomfortable. I do not have a large calf, but it was way too tight around my calf, and having my toe pulled back over time just felt bad. Too bad, it's supposed to really help heel issues. Instead, I'm doing PT and exercises, and it's getting better slowly. A podiatrist is overseeing my treatment, and he did not recommend the sock."
2,Not as expected,"The sock is not doing what was expected of it. The top of it will not stay where it is supposed to while sleeping, it slips down from the calf which makes the purpose of it nil. In explaining this to my Physical Therapist, her suggestion is to wear it for a few hours while sitting in a chair during the evening prior to going to bed but this is not what it was designed to do. It is disappointing to have to resort to this."
2,Sock for planatar fasciitis,"I bought this at the recommendation of my doctor, and tried them for months. They did not help at all, and in fact, they made the balls of my feet hurt in addition to the rest of the discomfort. I went to a rigid boot for sleeping and that helped much more. Did not cure me, mind you, but provided a lot better relief than this stupid sock. I gave it away as soon as my boot showed up. I would not recommend this product."
4,Better than boot,"I use it to stretch my Achilles while sleeping to help treat plantar fasciitis. It's much more comfortable to sleep with than the original fixed boot I received. Taking one star off for the price, $30+ for a sock w/ velcro straps?"
2,Uncomfortable,"To be fair, I will mention that i only wore it 1 night therefore, I can't speak to the effectiveness. I can speak to the materials however and while the sock seems to be built well, the material is uncomfortable. Also, I ordered the medium and it was too long (I stand at 5'8"")."
3,Could work,"Just as ordered, I got this on time and was just fine with it, . Just din`t like the how tight the sock was"
2,sock size up,Sock was as pictured and described. No complaint about that but it only gave me a leg cramp and welt from the tightness of the sock encasing my leg. For those reasons I was disappointed but this could just be me.
3,Strassburg Sock,"Seems to help plantar fascitis, but was not a cure for the variant I have. My podiatrist said to stop using it while we tried his methods, which are not helping either!"
2,Not as good as I thought,"Product is a little large for me and my height is 5' 6"". I used it several night even thought it was too large and I am not really sure if it did anything for me. The price is very high for only one sock and not a pair which shoul be at the price. I would not buy this again as I am not satisfied with it."
1,Useless,This device is useless. It slips down your thigh at night no matter how tight you pull the velcro. Don't waste your money like I did.
3,not knowing what to expect...,"i wasn't sure what to expect when i received this product. i was/am looking for relief for my plantar fascitis in my foot. the sock itself is not uncomfortable, but be careful how much you cinch the strap from your toe area. if too much tension is placed on it the sock will slip down from your leg thus rendering it useless and/or too much tension will make it uncomfortable to sleep in. it tends to pull on your toes more that lift the entire foot.the pain in my foot is less, but not as much as i had hoped for. i have been using the sock for about 3 weeks now. since purchasing this product i have seen others out there that i may be interested in."
4,Works for it's purpose but is coming unraveled,"I've only had this item slightly more than a month and wear them every night. I do feel they help with the plantar fascitis pain. However, the stitching at the top of the sock near to where the velcro pull is located is coming apart. That's concerning to me since I haven't had them very long. Based on the cost, I would have expected them to last much longer than this."
2,"Didn't work for me, but may for others.","This was recommended to me by a friend, but didn't work quite as well for me as it did for him. It's a bit uncomfortable, it bends your toes up at an unpleasant angle. There wasn't any noticeable improvement in my foot pain from using this. But maybe it just wasnt right for me."
2,Too tight for 15 inch calf,I ordered this sock to address plantar faciitis and made sure to measure my calf not once or twice but three times. This was much too tight and I am going to order the larger size.
1,Midieval Torture Device,"I had high hopes for this device seeing as how it was recommended to my by an orthopedic physician, but I was sorely disappointed. I guess it would do the job if you can stand it. It puts a lot of pressure on the end of my toes and feels a lot like wearing shoes a size too small only worse I guess. I managed to get through the first night even though the tips of my toes were pretty sore by morning, but the second night the pain was just too much to bear. I wore it part of the night and gave up on it. I couldn't sleep and the pain was worsening. The tips of my toes stayed sore for several days. It didn't matter how much I loosened the strap; it still hurt. I tried again after a few weeks giving my toes time to heal in between with the same results. This device was a complete waste of money!"
2,Not worth the money.,I bought this looking for a magical cure for my accute PF from running. After a week of using I decided to purchase a reverse boot like support instead. I chose the boot instead because it doesn't cut off your circulation around/under your knee like this sock. The boot is low cut and holds the foot and ankle firmer. I was constantly waking up during the night readjusting this sock and tighting it back up. You have to position it just right to make it feel comfortable and I was constantely adjusting it through out the night. Would not buy.
1,More uncomfortable than the boot!,"I was eager to try this since it's marketed as a comfortable alternative to the boot. I'm very disappointed I paid so much for this. I couldn't wear it more than 10 minutes. My calf is smaller than the max size it says it fits, yet the material really dug into my calf and just felt tight and suffocating on my leg. Someone else said it's not for side sleepers (not sure why) and I'm a side sleeper too, so maybe I would have had issues with that if I had been able to wear it all night.My verdict: overpriced, extremely uncomfortable and very disappointing product."
3,Just ok,So far just ok I have fairly small legs and the top velcro slips easily ....Need to widen the velcro at the top Seems to be helping a bit
2,"Somewhat helpful, but it hurts your toes","It will keep your foot in a somewhat flexed position, but to get a strong flexed position you have to pull it very tight, which will cause a lot of pain in your toes. I could only use mine for a limited time - not all night."
3,Okay,Tight on calf...pinches. It was a bit expensive for what is provides. Did not solve the problem. May work for other folks.
2,Sock,"The Sock didn't fit as advertised, but the Return process was smooth and easy. We found another way to deal with the issue."
4,Great Product - really works,"I found the Strassburg Sock after trying a different product by Darco. The Strassburg Sock worked very well. It has a large range of adjustment, is easy to adjust and is much more comfortable for me to sleep in than the Darco was. It really helped my foot."
1,Not a Fan,"I bought two of these to help with plantar faciitis in both feet and I hated them. My calf is less than 16"" around, but I still felt like the sock was cutting off my circulation both at the band at the top of the calf and everywhere else. The strap is crazy. I felt like my foot was in a straight jacket. Each night that I tried a sock, after sleeping about 2 hours I awoke with the feeling that I had to get the sock off asap or I would die. Also, the seam at the toe where the strap is attached made the top of my big toe hurt a lot. I tried for about two weeks but could never make it through the night with them on - maybe 4 hours tops which was not enough time to help my plantar faciitis at all."
1,not worth the price,only a few articles and half of all the news of the last edition. why I should read again yesterday news?
3,No Authors Listed!?,"I like the chronological reading experience of reading Salon on my kindle, but there are no by lines. It's so strange! I don't know how they're getting away with that. Please comment on this review if I am mistaken."
1,I Don't Get It,"Literally, I don't get it; I cannot subscribe to Salon for Kindle. I read it at one time, and would have continued to subscribe to it. But then I bought a Kindle Fire to replace my Kindle second generation and it was no longer available. I queried Amazon about it and they confirmed that it was not available for Kindle Fire. They reported that the publisher had not made it available for Fire. Apparently, Salon chooses not to provide it for Fire or cannot format it for Fire or has decided there may not be adequate return on investment to support an investment in formatting it for Fire. Whatever the reason, Kindle Fire owners will not read this version of Salon on their Fires until something changes."
4,I love the Kindle feed...but does Salon love us?,"It seems that on this review page, Salon Can't Hear Us Scream. I like getting the Kindle product because out on the endlessly fascinating Web is not the right place for me. But I do not feel the love from Salon. (Why do they not even include bylines? A literary Witness Protection Program?) Never mind. There are at least a couple of articles a week that I would be extremely sorry to have missed. So it goes."
3,Power brick died after 15 minutes; took 6 days to replace,"When I opened the box I was surprised to discover a 2x3x6-inch external power brick, something not mentioned in the ""What's in the Box"" section above.Shortly after finishing setup, the power brick died. Next morning I phoned the Sharp help number and spoke with a very pleasant and helpful person in Illinois. After hearing the symptoms and asking a few questions, she agreed that the power brick was the problem, and said they'd send another one out, and to expect it in ""4 to 5 business days"". I asked if there was any way to expedite the shipment and she said she'd try, but couldn't guarantee anything. Two business days later Sharp shipped the new part by UPS ground. It arrived 6 days after reporting the problem. I think that's unacceptable.Once powered, this set has a picture that's excellent. The remote is rather oddly shaped, but feels good in the hand. The remote is easy to operate and provides many useful features."
4,NO MORE FIGHTS OVER TV VOLUME !,"I was driving husband nuts with requests to turn up the volume on the TV.Of course he HAS to keep the remote.This has solved all our problems. I just get tucked in (Baby it's cold outside!) put on my headphones, and I'm good for the entire evening.No more complaints that the loud TV is giving him a headache.Hooray for this product. And the price is VERY right."
2,TV ear phones,They are great when they work (but don't always work which is quite often) would suggest to go out & try some before purchasing these!
4,Unisar TV Listener 777,Received the two headset model of the TV777. I am very satisfied with the product particularly since it included a small microphone to amplify the audio from our Sharp 26 inch TV. The TV has no audio output so the microphone was perfect. We use the TV in our RV and the volume range of the Sharp was grossly inadequate. When we use our satellite dish we can pick up the audio from the DirecTV satellite box directly thus avoiding the need to use the microphone. The downside from the microphone is that it can pickup other room noise...... but that is not the fault of the Unisar unit. I have recommended the unit to our friends with the same TV.
2,Fair reading,"This book had the prophgecies I was looking for..However, The author mentioned Edgar Cayce too many times, which led me to wonder how much was not Hopi Information...I closed the book half way thru."
1,A dissenting view,"I'll be the ""designated"" dissenting view here amongst all of these positive reviewers. This was not my cup of tea. That assuredly has alot to do with my estimation of this book. Above and beyond the rather off-the-wall mysticism and somewhat pseudo-native American spirituality, the editing is horrible. Misspelt words everywhere! I don't care how bad a book is in terms of its content, at least the author and publisher can check the spelling for god's sake! To me, that kind of error says alot about the author and the lack of professionalism in general. I just thought his viewpoint was hokey."
3,Broken on arrival,"Item arrived with a broken corner, but none of the packaging showed any damage. I've used several Hot File pockets for many years, with no breakage, and will buy more.Amazon.com promptly refunded my purchase price to my account after I returned it."
4,"Spirited, smart, and sounds good. This is country?!","This debut album is a great introduction to MC&V.; Matty's voice will grab hold of you immediately with its warm amber tones crooning lyrics of longing and love. I hate country, and if this is country, well then, I love country.'Satellite', 'What I Want', and 'Summer Days' are probably the best tracks in this album, IMHO, but the album in its entirety is splendid. It's the musical equivalent of a gorgeous summer day relaxing in a hammock, glass of lemonade within reaching distance while you contemplate the beauty of the universe.Ya gotta get this album. Do it before they get big so you can say you discovered 'em."
3,Good one but slooow...,Great dialog but not too much action. It is a good story with very few characters. Super sweet though. Something to say about modern families nowadays.
1,Avoid this!,"This album is once again an overdubbing of Buddy Holly classic recordings with backing vocals by the Picks, a.k.a. John Pickering and the rest of The Picks who drown out Buddy's performances. Avoid this at all cost!Buyers beware!"
5,Saying Yes to Life (Even the Hard Parts),Got this for a friend who has breast cancer. Great words and thoughts.
3,Pretty middle of the road,"This book is a pleasant and funny look at a single 30-something in Manhattan looking for the woman of his dreams. It's an easy read and very likeable. It's not particularly deep or profound, but it's not a waste of time either."
1,Don't buy this product,"Owning this product has been a lousy experience. While installation seemed easy and the product worked well at the first trial, that quickly changed after the first reboot. The company does not supply drivers or support tools for XP (I have a plain but new Dell computer). The time and effort spent trying to solve all the interoprability issues with this product has offset the initial savings manyfold. Next time I'll buy from a better known manufacturer that provide a minimum amount of support tools!"
5,Happy Being Me: Suki's Kimono,"This effervescent story, with its vivid, carefree illustrations and its protaganist's refreshing win-win attitude, is a rousing celebration of individuality and joie de vivre. We love Suki!!"
2,Color is completely misrepresented,"Two other reviewers have mentioned it already: the color of this sleeping bag is completely different from what you see on screen. The outside is a purplish-brown color, while the inside is a murky, dark green. The color is so far from what you see on screen that I suspect it's a different model bag entirely. The reason I bought this bag is because it's one of the few out there with a cotton cover both inside and out - but if you are buying this as a gift, beware that you won't be getting the cheerful red bag with a classic plaid lining, but instead something that looks like it's designed to blend in with the ground it's used on."
1,Color shift?,I ordered this sleeping bag after my daughter picked it out. She had picked it out because it was pink in color. Imagine her and my disappointment when the sleeping bag arrived for her birthday and was a deep wine color instead!Somehow the color is completely misrepresented. In addition my daughter noted that the inside material of the sleeping bag is also different from the image shown.Not sure who's issue this is but the product image is incorrect as the part number on line matches what was shipped.
3,ok read,I want go in to a lot of details. If you have been wating on the story like me due to you read the first two then u will be greatly disappointed. It was a slow read for a short book. I enjoyed the first two book they were full of action and romance this one was kinda slow.
4,the buggiest disk i've heard,"the first disk is just incredible. the second disk has a few good tracks on it, but it doesn't compare. a definite must have for anyone into progressive trance."
1,1 scary moment and that's it.,Do yourself a favor. Don't get this film. There's nothing you haven't seen before a million times. And done better too. I was completely disappointed. No scares to be found. Get Darkness Falls instead.
1,BOOGYman = worth boogers only...totally BORING and LAME,"This is another bad ""horror"" movie, that recently flooded the market. Suprisingly bad it made me wonder how the script did not end up on a rejection pile. Actually you are not quite sure what is going on other than some very bad acting which has bored me to tears. (No joke I yawned so much tears starting coming out it was THAT awefully dull.) I had a VERY hard time staying awake, and it totally relies on sudden loud noises to so-call scare you. Scare? Tell me what is so scary about this movie other than boring me to silly, bad script, bad acting, and a complete waste of time. I thought this movie was even more stupid than the a lot of bad horror movies I've seen.I rented this movie and even with just renting I feel ripped off. If you buy this--well, you have been warned."
1,What A Mess,"Apparently the new ""horror"" is to get TV actors, surround them with eerie atmosphere, very good cinematography, and halfway decent spooks, and slap a PG-13 rating on the whole darn thing. Unfortunately, good storytelling doesn't seem to fall into any of the aforementioned requisites, and it is in criminally short supply in BOOGEYMAN. Barry Watson, who is only slightly less charisma-free than former TV sibling Jessica Biel, plays a man still haunted by...darkness, or something in the dark, or someone in the dark--there is a point somewhere in there, but halfway through this lazy, suspense-free non-thriller, you're going to want to bolt and truly not want to know the whole point of this waste of filmmaking. Suffice it to say, the plot is a slight re-telling of that horror ""classic"" from a few years ago, DARKNESS FALLS, only about ten times less interesting--yes, a scary sheet flying around on a wire hanger was far scarier than anything here. Avoid at all costs."
2,Whatta mess!,"I remember seeing the previews of this movie on TV and now realize how slanted they were. They made you think this was going to be a scary, Nightmare on Elm Street type of flick but it's nothing like that. For one thing, you're never sure whether the hero, played very well by Barry Watson, is dreaming or imagining or whether the events are real. He keeps going into these rooms where he knows the boogeyman is waiting for him but does he even carry a weapon of some kind? Nooooooo. I couldn't tell whether his father was really captured by the boogeyman or whether this was a dream. This movie tries hard to be like ""The Others"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" but doesn't come anywhere close. I was amazed to discover that the director, Stephen Kay, was one of the key forces in the creation of the great ""Evil Dead' movies. What happened, Stevie?"
2,boring,There was little excitement in it and it moved so slow. Some of it made no sense either like what did the mom have to do with anything? What were all those kids doing? What point did Kate have? This went by slow and wasn't scary at all. I should have weeded the garden instead.
2,If the sound wasn't so good... I would have fallen alsleep!,"Could have been a really good movie, but ended up being two thumbs down!AND could they have at least make the so called ""Boogeyman"" look scary and realistic, and not soooooooooooo ""Cartoonish"" or animated!!!!!!! I mean it's ""2005"" folks... not ""1950""!!! I was SSShhaakking in my seat!NOT!!!But on a positive note, two thumbs up for the sound effects! Pretty darn good, and for that it's worth an extra star in my book! (But then again I do have a Bose System, however it was turned up to the max!!! Oh well...Go figure!)"
3,Here's the Boogeyman !!,"This movie didn't put me to sleep like some of these other people are saying.It's dry for only 1 or 2 moments.The idea of what the Boogeyman is , is kinda cool and original.There's a stand of between Boogeyman and the main actor at the end.It's worth renting easily , but I wouldn't buy this flick for 20 bucks or 15 bucks.It's one of them movies that I'd scoop up on the 10 dollar rack.~Everything you fear at night will kill you~"
2,Honest Review,"This movie was below your typical horror movie. It was slow and had barely a plot. It will have you jumping a few times and asking a lot of questions, many that never are answered because that's just how it's written. It's not written to make any sense or have a great story, just to have some ""make-you-jump-scenes."" Hollywood even hinted at it's terrible screenplay when they hid it from critics. The movie couldn't even get a quote from a newspaper or anybody for that matter for it's cover because it would ruin somebody's credibility. But if you are super bored and just wanna watch a movie that will make you jump with you girlfriend or boyfriend that go ahead watch it, but if you're looking for something good, don't bother."
2,My seat was comfortable!,"I was sitting in a comfortable seat with chilling air conditioning for 88 minutes. I started to thinking about what I have to do tomorrow, and if should go to sleep early tonight. ""At least I'm here for free"", I said to myself, as I noticed that there is a ""scary"" movie running in front of my face. What the hell was this movie? OK I got it. You saw Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and you were inspired, but why imitate in such a degrading way elements from that masterpiece to create such a bad movie. Something exciting and original could have been used in ""Boogeyman"", and for a moment there I thought that there might be something intelligent coming out of this film. I talking about the scene where he passes through closets as if they were portals in space and time, but alas, it was nothing. I give it 5 out of 10, and just because I had a good day."
2,I've seen worse.,"Considering the genre of this film, and the line-up of releases I've seen over the past few months, this could have been alot worse. That being said, it could have been alot better too. A few tense moments, acting a little better than average for this kind of film(which really isn't saying all that much), and an ugly CG clotted ending that was torture to watch. Rent it if you really want to see it, but its not worth buying."
1,This movie SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It rates below Jeepers Creepers 2. It was absolutley horrible. I wasn't even close to the edge of my seat. I'm almost sad that I have to rate this movie with a star at all. It deserves no stars. I want my money back..........
2,Is this a nightmare on elm street or a different movie?,"It's just like a Nightmare on Elm Street, teenager cant go to sleep or suffer stupid fatal injuries that can kill you in your sleep. Have you ever heard of slapping your face to keep you awake?"
2,so so horror movie,"I didn't really think of this as a horror movie. More like a bad joke. The plot did not get interesting until the last 15 minutes or so. Alot of things were not explained. Do not waste an afternoon on this, it isn't worth it. I almost went to sleep halfway through the movie, seriously."
3,"Boogeyman has cool moments, decent rental","Sure its got some cheese, but its also got some scares, some coolness and I've seen far worst do better in the reviews.I believe a good film gets slammed if it ends on a bad note. Boogeyman has some inherit CGI problems that are basically becoming old news to us new age veterans of cinema... but the lead ups offer some legitimate suspence. So if your not renting it purely on reviews, I say give it a go....(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
2,A True Letdown......,"Wow, hearing that this is one of the scariest films of all time, I just had to see Boogeyman, even though it was rated just PG-13. What false advertisement! This movie is not scary at all!! A man returns to his childhood home where he remembers at a young age seeing his father being pulled into a closet by the ""boogeyman"". He returns to confront his fears of all these years but this movie is boring at times and not even suspenseful. If you expect a scary film, you will be disappointed!!!!"
2,Good movie flawed,"At the start of the movie,the boogeyman looked as though it was going to be a good horror movie,but soon changed.This movie is more of a phycological thriller than a true horror movie,like the Grudge.All in all it was an enjoyable film with an interesting plot and set of characters.The story is about a man named Tim, who as a child of 8 saw his father taken by the boogeyman.Tim,now 23,is terrified of closets,small rooms,and tiny openings."
1,AWFUL,"This Movie was great if you like edge of your seat fright but as far as plot and storyline it came up short , it was very confusing and not well thought at all if i were the director i would have explained it much clearer it leaves you with the feeling of being unfinished and not very good at all i wouldnt give it even one star a half star would be pushing it and i dont usually rate movies so poorly but it was awful......"
3,Not Terrible but not great,"The scariest thing about the whole movie was all the sudden loud sharp music that came in when their was silence. I had to turn my surround sound down and turn on subtitles so I could see what the characters were saying. Not a bad plot but it was reminisent of some of the horror movies that have came out the last few years. My opinion if you haven't seen it rent it dont buy, but if you want a good horror film with an excellent ending buy Saw, its a million times better than Boogeyman or The Grudge, which was one of the most overhyped movie I've ever seen, it sucked, but Boogeyman was OK. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could."
2,Not a good movie!,Boogeyman was not a good movie. It was boring and the plot was driven down by trying to hard to be scary and romantic at the same time. I just feel that I wasted my time as this movie wasn't scary and its plot was-honestly I am not sure what the plot was!? I just feel this may be a good rent and who knows it may even be better. But for the movies as much as it cost even the cheap one I went to was not worth my four dollars. I don't even know how to explain this movie and to describe it because I was so bored I tended to not even watch it all. This is a clean drama like movie with no umph. Consider all the bad reviews on here as they really are not lying but if you are like me and want to make the judgment yourself you cannot be mad at how terrible the movie is; because there are warnings all over the reviews.
1,I kept waiting for something to happen!,"I rented Boogeyman thinking that it couldn't possibly be as bad as I'd heard. Unluckily for me, it was. At least half of the running time consists of Barry Watson slowly creeping towards a half-open door. NOT SCARY. The background information on the character's life in the old house is uncreative at best. There are few real scares here, and this is probably one of the worst examples of ""horror"" films using random visions to try and make you jump out of your seat.Not worth your time."
3,"L ike everything else, not as good as what was expected","This wasnt youre basic horror flick I thought, it didnt scare u all the way trough it saved it up and scared at certain parts. The rest was like a detective movie. The whole time through the movie Barry Watson the lead character was runnin around like a chicken with his head cut off tryin to figure the (Boogeyman)out like where it came from and how to get rid of it. He figures it out at the end of course when he could of figured it out at the beggining and tried to do it thruogh the movie. Well it was an ok movie it's worth seeing and everything just dont expect it to be a clasic. Sorry the review is short, but I need to go to sleep. I promise I will review this at length some time after the DVD comes out. Maybe then I might have some sleep, and a second viewing may give me a better out lokk on this film. But for now let me say you can't go wrong with Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert."
3,Frightening at parts--but I could handle it.,"I believe that ""Boogeyman"" is one of the scariest movies I've seen, but I've definately seen better. There were parts that I was positively hiding the shirt of my boyfriend. I jumped quite a bit. This movie was the first scarey movie I've seen in theatres though too. Umm-- I wasn't happy that they showed what the Boogeyman looked like at the end though. I think that the movie would've been better if they didn't show what he looked like. But.. I would say go see it! Only if you aren't paying over $6.00."
3,BIG AL REVIEW,THOUGHT THE MOVIE DRAGGED OUT MOST OF THE TIME......ONLY ACTION WAS A FEW MINUTES AT THE END.......I DID NOT HATE IT... BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN.....IT'S A MOVIE TO WATCH WHEN NOTHING ELSE IS ON....
2,Don't waste your money in theatres,"This movie is about as good as shuting off all the lights at night and listening to the wind. It starts off scary but then you realise it's just a waste of time and that its not scary anymore.If the first 20 minutes of this movie wern't so good, I would have given this movie 1 star. But, if the whole movie was as good as the first 20 mins, I would have easily given it 5 stars. But its not so wait for DVD for this one, but shut it off when the first 20 mins are over. (or just listen to the wind for a while...might be scaryer...you never know :P)"
2,First 30 minutes are good; then goes downhill from there.,"I don't read movie reviews until I've seen the film because the critics reveal too much about the story, that and the fact that I like to form my own opinion. The previews of this film look great, as is the premise. Great concept and attention grabbing beginning, but beyond that, I was very disappointed with this film. Aside from the previews, I was encouraged that this film was from the producers of ""The Grudge"", which in itself was okay, but other than the first 30 minutes, you'll be disappointed with Boogeyman."
1,THE EFFECTS!,"Ok, the plot was cool, the ideah was creepy. But the effects were so cheesy it looked like they were trying to make the monster as a cartoon. NOTHING LOOKED REAL! OMG PEOPLE IF YOU CANT DO GOOD EFFECTS DONT DO EM AT ALL! Take notes from most stephen king movies, hellraiser series, candyman, and the exorcist and you'll be alright."
1,A Complete Waste of Time and Money,"You know what would have made ""Boogeyman"" scarier? Just about anything! Truly nothing happens in this movie after the first five minutes. The lead guy walks around teary-eyed and looking mysterious at half opened doors or ceiling tiles......and then.....nothing. Don't waste your time with this thing, if you want something that sets a pretty good eerie mood, get ""Fear of the Dark"" instead. It's shot on almost no budget, with no stars of any kind, but at least ""Fear of the Dark"" gives the viewer some kind of pay-off, and packs at least a minimal fright factor."
4,forget the critics!,"I recently watched Boogeyman, and I was sooooo glad I didnt listen to every wannabe critic in every magazine and newspaper i picked up. I was told, and i read, that this film was rubbish. Whereas it's really not.I'm not gonna summarise it, i'm just going to tell you that this film is pretty scary. I will admit that the alst half isnt really as scary as the first half. But there is interesting, but confucing, twists in the second half that will consume you. And the ending was strange too, but very watchable.If you wanna get totally freaked out, as I did, watch this in the dark, with the volume up high and you'll get every jump and chill out of this movie...."
2,Ummm..It's okay,"Being a huge horror fan that I am I already know that the original good times of horror movies(60's,70's and 80's) is long gone. This movie was okay but should have and could have been alot scarier especially seeing as how it's something that almost every kid fears at some point."
2,Everyone said it was just a story,"Based on the film rating and the cast (that I knew of), I was expecting more PG-13 trash like ""Cry Wolf"", which I had also recently seen and been disappointed by.This movie began looking a bit darker, though, giving me some hope early on. From there, it just got increasingly boring and increasingly cheesy. It's a decent story and it is at least somewhat spooky, but it is by no means a horror film. There are many boring lulls in the movie that will lose your attention quite easily. The boogeyman looks pretty freaky, when you finally see him, but only for the first few shots, that are CGI mixed with someone in actual makeup. When they switch to the CGI boogeyman alone, it just looks fake.This movie is disappointing. You will probably not be frightened."
1,BOOGEYMAN GARBAGE,"THIS MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOVEVER. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT IT IS THE INTERESTING CAMERA WORK, SOME VERY INTERSETING SHOTS GIVE IT A NICE ATMOSPHERE, OTHER THAN THAT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME."
2,"Too long, even at 89 minutes.","I expected so much more from a film with Sam Raimi's name attached to it. It just goes on and on...The resolution came fast, and left a lot of questions unanswered. All in all, I was disappointed. The cast was fine. Even with his one expression, Barry Watson is certainly handsome enough to keep you watching. The acting is generally OK for this kind of film, and there's a particularly good perfomance from young Skye McCole Bartusiak. I love this genre, and almost bought it. Then a friend loaned it to me, and saved me a few bucks. After buying ""Darkness"" and ""White Noise"", sight unseen (both of which disappointed me), I'm glad to know I made the right choice.When do you think we'll get a really good ghost movie? ""The Others"" was the last decent one I can remember."
2,The end is so bad it ruins the film !,"""BOOGYMAN"" has a handful of great scares then falls flat on its face with its fluffy puffy sunny day ending."
1,Not Even Worth A Real Review,"I don't review often, but when I do, it's always a thoughtfully put and honest review. This movie that I just wasted 88 minutes of my life on (which felt more like 2 1/2 hours) isn't worth a real review by me. I just didn't like seeing this movie having a 2 1/2 star rating. It deserves nothing more than 2.One-Line actual review: Movies this bad can only be justified by over-the-top gore, which can only come from an R rating or non-rated."
3,ok..,Boogyman was a ok horror movie. I dident really like it for a few reasons. One was the story. It felt incomplete and not making sense. Secondly the acting was not all that good either. But the mive wasent that bad it had its freaky moments.
3,not as a bad as others have said,"I am the first to admit that over the last couple of years horror movies have lost its scariness and creepy fill. Suprising though is this movie. Overall no, it wasn't that scarey and I did not leave me laying awake at night scared to death to close my eyes, but honestly, no horror movie has been able to do that since I was 3 years old.The first 10 minutes of this movie has got to be the scariest...the crow creeped me out...after that no, it wasn't that scarey and needless to say you kind of figure out what the ""boogeyman"" really is. During the last thrity or so minutes, after the motel, you start to wonder, ""What the hell is going on???"" I mean, was their a portal through all the closets in that town that allowed superfast traveling?? I dunno...but for a movie it wasn't that bad and I have definetly seen a lot worse... i.e. the grudge... geez that was a piece of crapola!"
1,this is so scary the ring was nothing im going to be 13 in aug 4,this is the scariest movie ever made I got so freaked out. the ring was boring not scary. i hate real scary. 1' 2' 3 '4' 5 '6 what happins when you count to 6 to defeat the boogeyman you don't fear him! I thought it was scary when his dad gets killed by the boogeyman. this movie is about fear and fearing the boogeyman.
1,Stop watching after 5 minutes.....,"The first 5 mins were awesome - after that a few moments were good (like seeing the ghosts of the 'taken' children).The rest was largely confusing or simply failed to come together.Questions are simply rasied and never explored:Did the living and dead children all see the same boogeyman or their own personal one?Did the living children only see the boogeyman beacuse Tim was around? (like the girl in the mental hospital - BM was watching her by lifting up a panel of drop ceiling - cool!)If so, was Tim around when all the other children were 'taken'?If not, why is Tim so sure he conquered the BM and that 'its over' and 'he won't be back'?As far as Tim's ability to travel from the motel to the house via the closets (like the BM) - what's up with that?Is this an ability of Tim due to his connection with the BM or was the BM just messing with him?Not worth watching after the first 5 mins - but those 5 were pretty cool!"
1,THE REAL BOOGEYMAN WAS THE DIRECTOR,This movie can be compared to the scary things lurking on the floor of the movie theatre.
1,Boring,"This is the worst movie I've seen this year. This movie was terribly boring and relied on the 'bump into something, make an incredibly loud and annoying noise to scare you' routine. The script sucked, the acting sucked, the gore sucked...nothing was good about this movie. Nothing."
1,Blinding Editing,"Creepy at first...Then begins the Headace Induced editing...My vision was blured for two hours after seeing this movie...My Eye Balls were Slam Dunked...Bounced..Spun Around...Back Handed..and visually assulted by the fast shifting editing...I hung in there waiting for the pay off, but even the end only a few minutes long was BAD..BAD..comic like C.G.I...and even that was sped up and even more Eye Damadging...and they lived happily ever after, the end... Warning Do Not watch this movie on a Big Screen TV, or risk visual inpairment! I wont even get into the Audio assult you will also indure...where is my Visine? ..and asparin?"
4,Root of Fear,"As one who grew up being warned about the boogeyman, this had more relevance to me than my kids. If not for a fabulous opening sequence, I would have scored this a 2.5 or 3, but there's nothing like reinforcing a child's fears to add pleasure to the thing.As a horror fan, I found Boogeyman to be decent although fairly predictable and I would have been far happier without the ""happy ending"" element. There were some good things going on, nice interaction between characters and some nice cinematography.Probably most enjoyable if you are over the age of 30 and remember the simple pleasures of childhood fear in the name of ""the boogeyman""."
2,It's not good ... but ...,"I think though that people are being a bit hard on this film. It's not ""House of the Dead"" or ""Alone in the Dark"" bad, it's problem is that it's not doing ANYTHING even remotely interesting or inventive on any level. ""Boogeyman"" is just a clone of both ""Wes Craven's 'They'"" and ""Darkness Falls."" Neither of which were really memorable for ... well ... much of anything. In fact I almost felt as if the opening scene when Tim's Dad was taken was almost LIFTED DIRECTLY from ""Darkness Falls.""I could NEVER recommend buying a copy, but if you wanted to rent it you could do it without feeling robbed. For that matter, if you need a scary movie for someone a little younger, there's virtually no gore and I didn't notice any foul language. In that role maybe this has a little bit of value. Not much, mind you, but maybe a little."
3,Decent,"Boogeyman was a decent film, didnt scare me, didnt come close, but overall it was a nice film. The boy is tormented by the 'man' and finnaly defeats him as he gets older and ends it all ."
1,PLEASE! DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!,"This is a bad bad movie... nothing happens. It's not scary at all, it's ridiculous!! Don't throw you money away!! Buy a Soda, buy pizza, buy an ice cream cone or give the money to someone who really needs it, but warn that person to which you are giving your money to that he should not for any reason go and rent this movie. It's awful!Trust me. I am an intelligent man, I know what I'm saying.Besides, read the other reviews as well.The movie sucks big time."
1,Tried to keep myself from falling asleep....,"Wow. I would give this movie zero stars, but darn that's not an option. I have rented this movie from Blockbuster (thankfully) hoping that I would get a good scare. After turning on the movie, I could barely keep my head from rolling all about. The beggning of the movie has the most suspence and action and thats only 5 minutes of the entire movie. For the rest of the snooz flick I kept fast forwarding and the only part i got a kick out of was when the crow smashed into the car window. It has been done before and the movie was very UNSUSPENSFUL and very BEEN THERE, DONE IT theme. The end of the movie couldn't come fast enough and the ending was bull**** anyways. If you think this movie deserves 5 stars because its soo scary then you must be the kind of person that pissed in their pants during Bambi."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"Not nearly as scary as the reviews claimed it was. In fact, it wasn't really all that scary at all. Nothing particularly unique or special - same old same old. The ending was a disappointment as well."
3,Not as bad as I expected,"After reading some of the reviews of this movie I regretted renting it. But after watching it, I realized it wasn't that bad. It wasn't as scary as I had hoped, but what PG-13 horror movie is? If I had watched it by myself in the dark, instead of broad daylight, I might've actually be more scared. It definitely could've been better, possibly if it had been rated R. Who knows? Rent it and decide for yourself."
1,Another snore-fest,"Geeze..I had high hopes for this movie,having been tormented by my own boogeyman when I was really little..I like to be scared,but this just didn't do it.I finally resorted to using the slow-forward button on my DVD player,so I could see if the creature was scary...he was pretty cool,actually,but the rest of the movie didn't make up for those 5 minutes of enjoyment.I just wish,since the new direction movies are taking,i.e. ""scary,"" that they actually BE scary.The best actor in the movie was the little girl.Everyone else looked like they were sleeping through the movie..the actors,I mean,although I'm pretty sure a lot of the people watching this sub-par ""scary"" movie fell asleep after the first half-hour.Give me ""The Woman in Black;"" or ""The Changeling,"" or the best:""The Haunting,""1963.Now those are scary!!!!"
1,Simply Bad !!!!!!!!!!,"If you MUST rent this movie, just watch the first 5 minutes... that is all that is good about this movie.After that it falls to the level of typical cheese and B movie lameness. (not to mention the subtle attempts at mimmicking certain Hitchcock Psycho images).Everything else you read on here about how bad the movie is about sums it up.Although DARKNESS FALLS was not a GREAT movie either, it is basically the same identical theme and plot line but is better done and more worthy of renting over this dissapointment."
2,Not what i thought,"I thought this movie was going to be spectacular, judging by their fantastic website. It ended up being sort of cheesey and unrealistic, and I think it was more of a show off of special effects rather than making a good storyline."
4,Boogeyman review,"I have the 2nd and 3rd installments to this DVD collection, and now that I have the first one I was able to watch them all from first to last. The movie has a good storyline, in depth details, and leads you from one scene to another, wanting more. A good movie for the horror fans, and a great buy."
2,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"NOT WORTHY!!! THE HYPE FOR THIS MOVIE AND THE GREATNESS OF IT WERE SO OFF,, SO MUCH HYPE FOR SUCH CRAP!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR THIS!! GO AHEAD AND WATCH PART 2 ITS BETTER THAN THIS ONE LMAO-- THIS SUCKED SO BAD THAT NOBODY WANTS TO WATCH THE SECOND ONE BUT AT LEAST IT IS BETTER THAN THIS ONE!! BARELY ENTERTAINING check out boogeyman 2! instead"
3,They make the Boogeyman CG.,"It had good style. Good atmosphere. Good scary momets. Good weird out moments. There was a faint sixth sense stealing going on here. But the one thing that totally got my goat was the fact that they showed what the bogeyman looked like. And in CGI, no less. Why? It was powerful all up until they decided to show that. It would have been better not to show becuase then you have fear of the unkown. Fear of the unkown is an important tool when making a movie."
2,Horrible!,I would give it 1 star but I like Barry Watson too much to do that. It isn't what I expected it to be. It was supposd to be edge of your seat scary but it wasn't nearly. You only get to see the boogeyman ONCE! ONE TIME!! And on that one time it's not long. Don't waste your money on this crap.
1,Bad....Just Bad.,"Choppy,predictable & pointless, all at the same time..Wow...If you must see this movie rent or wait for cable. Get really for alot of semi-plot lines that will leave you with question after question.Then pop in your old copy of ""Night of The Living Dead"" or ""A Nightmare on Elm street"" It will make you feel better."
1,Shoulda stayed in the closet,"Touted as being the ""scariest movie of the year"" is quite a thing to live up to. Unfortunately, this does not even come close. It's a mixed bag of snippits from ""They"", ""Darkness Falls"", ""Darkness"", with a little bit of ""The Mummy"" thrown in there for all those who can't get enough of video game-like CGI effects. The sound effects are the only thing remotely frightening about this film. It's a great idea that was not dealt with in the right way. Stephen King did it brilliantly as did Wes Craven many years ago. Too bad the makers of this film had no idea what to do with the Boogeyman once they channeled him. They should have left him in the closet to stay. He was scarier there."
2,Is this supposed to be scary?,"Here's a story about a guy that continues to look in closets and under beds for a boogeyman long after it killed his dad and also proved deadly to his female family members.From this germ the film is supposed to take us on a dark journey back to his family home where the deadly apparition still resides. He goes back and finds it. Trouble is, it's never scary for us along the way. In fact, it's totally forgettable.A ton of scenes in half-lit rooms with shadowns moving about and things going swish in front of the camera can't do a thing to add aura or tension to this marshmallow of a film. The bad guy is not going down in film history as being very memorable, either.Forget this thing and move on to something else if you're looking for thrills, scares or emotional involvement with the characters."
1,One of the Worst Horror Films in the Last Decade,"This is in my opinion the worst example of a mainstream horror movie in the last ten years.There is almost no point to anything shown in this film. Much of this movie consists of just a bunch of random scenes of the main character opening closet doors while overusing cheap scare tactics such as loud shrieking sounds. When we finally get a chance to see this Boogeyman it is terribly done with a really bad cgi boogeyman. It comes off as corny and not in the least way scary. Forget the fact that there's no plot, there's barely any real scenario at all. The only thing close to a positive thing about this film is the fact that it does create a sense of atmosphere and also maybe that the film isn't really that long at only about 88 minutes. Overall a terrible film that is filled with bad horror cliches and little entertainment value. This film did however make enough money that two sequels were made. They however went straight to video."
2,Pretty good cure for insomnia,"A young kid sees his father killed by the boogeyman. Years later he's in college and gets a message on his phone that his mother's health is failing. Could he come and visit her? He doesn't even bother responding to the message, it's much more important to him to go to a party with his girlfriend. Yeah, real sympathetic character. Then his mother dies and he surprisingly finds time to go to her funeral - what a guy! - and he's also inherited the house where he saw the boogeyman kill his father. So he wanders around the house for most of the movie. He's terrified of dark closets, so at one point he goes into a dark closet and they edit a whole bunch of shots together of him being in the closet, while dramatic music plays. Yawn. This crap goes on forever.Overall, it's a boring movie and I didn't care at all about the characters. I give it 2 stars only because I've seen worse."
1,More run of the mill nonsense from Hollyweird,"I'm so glad I didn't see this in the theater.I was bored so I rented this mess of a movie.Who wasn't scared of the Boogyman when they were growing up?I had a hard time believing the directors would be able to pull off a decent movie and I was right.Horrid acting, horrid story, horrid everything.I think the only time I jumped was when the movie ended and I had to jump off the couch to take it out of the player.Lame, pathetic, and unmemorable. Another movie destined for the bargin bin.AVOID!!!"
1,Trust All the Reveiwers,HORRIBLE! This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. The story line was terrible. The monster looked fake. Just terrible. Take it from me. DON'T SEE IT>
1,No imagination at all.....,"This movie was a good idea since we all heard of the bogeyman since we were young. So it was a good idea to make a movie out of it. The previews on tv look somewhat interesting, but when it came to watching it, it was horrible, boring dumb, etc. The worst part is the ending. The ending of a movie tells much about a movie. It is usually a big fight or something similar. This film did not include anything similar to that. No imagination at all."
1,simply miserable,"In all seriousness, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Most crappy movies, I can look at and laugh at the worthlessness. This one was beyond that. There was about 5 minutes of action, and the rest was just a stupid storyline that made no sense. There was not a bit of horror in this movie. In some scenes they just moved the camera around, but literally nothing actually happened. I really am offended that someone thinks that anyone would watch this movie. I want my 90 minutes and $2 for renting it back."
3,Not bad but not what i expected,This movie was a pretty disapointment. The boogeyman was something wierd .It does have some scary parts but the end was a disapointment.Not at all what i expected.
2,THE BOOGEYMAN DOSEN'T LOOK SCARY!!!!!!!!!,"The beggining was the best part. Besides that it just wasn't that good. My sister told me that he looks stupid but I rented it and she was 100% right! I mean no, this wasn't the worst movie in the world but i didn't like it. Try some other horror movie!!"
2,For all of you Movie Moms,"For all of you movie moms out there, read this review to see if this movie is alright for your children to view.Language- Non-ExsistantSexual Themes- Exsistant and fairly strongDrug Usage- Drinking, references to being drunkViolence/Scariness- Constant Peril, violent abductions, frightening images, several people die or go missing, and a very creepy dream.I hope that this review was helpful ! :)"
1,Bad,"This is as bad as the flick Darkness. First of all, Barry Watson had NO chemistry with his rich-bitch girlfriend. I wanted her dead moments after meeting her. This wasn't scary at all. This was one of those flicks where the characters just continued to make very obvious bad choices which led to their demise. Rent Texas Chainsaw Remake where they stumble onto trouble and try to get away, as opposed to looking for trouble and doing nothing when it hits. Just plain bad. For god's sake, would someone please make a movie that is actually scary????"
2,This Movie Is Okay,"I Saw This Movie During The DayTime So It Wasn't THAT Scary, Which I Don't Really Think It Is. Some Parts Are Creepy Like The Little Girl, But Otherwise I Do Not Recommend This Movie!Sam O"
1,forgettable,"The first five minutes are practically the same as Darkness Falls, except the Tooth Fairy had a reason to kill. It has too many loud fake scares(see the review below) and some of it doesn't make sense(he goes into a motel closet, then ends up crawling out from under his friends bed). I could get by with that, however the ending totally kills this movie.The 'boogeyman' is a horrible CGI Mummy/Van Helsing reject. At least the cover is cool looking"
2,Unfullfilled promise.,"The first couple of minutes of this movie seemed pretty good...Then there was the rest.My ten year old daughter said it all to me before I watched it. The stole the idea from ""Darknes Falls"" but it wasn't as scary."
3,"Entertaining, but is it factual?","I bought this title in expectation of some explanations of the ancient Bible prophecies. Nowhere in this collection are there any mention of Daniel's prophecies concerning the 70 weeks or any attempted explanations of Ezekiels 430 days. While there are different attitudes and interpretations concerning these visions, i would think they would deserve being highlighted as one of the reasons these prophets were called prophets. Prophets working themselves into a frenzy, cannot be proven. A rather unflattering impression. Isaiah walked around naked for 3 years. Okay, that's a Bible fact.But what about all of his prophecies concerning the coming Messiah, that proved accurate? Oh well. As i said earlier, you can buy it for the enterainment value, but don't be misled or taken into someone elses opinion."
5,"Dr. Stark, why are you the best philosophy prof. ever?","Dr. Stark, I am buying your book you definately never plugged into your lectures. No doubt it will be worth the money, but you really should look into buying some regular ink and stop writing in gold, it costs way too much even though I know it matches your diamond encrusted gold chalk holder. ~ 'A' student Brooke"
2,Self aggrandisement...,"This book seemed to me to be more of a wish-fulfillment of the author than anything else. The usage of circumlocutory language became unbearable rather quickly, as did the overtones of arrogance. If you don't want to spend your time reading meandering writing with a plot that seems questionable, steer clear of this book."
1,What a waste of money!,"The product was shipped to me and when I received it the bottle was empty. It had soaked the box it came in and the other product I ordered was wet, too. Tried to get it exchanged and it was never sent to me. I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon until this time. So I guess I'll just have to enjoy my $10 empty bottle! Waiting for my statement to see if I was billed, again for the replacement that never came."
4,the unbridgeable breach,"First of all I have to compliment the author compiling this enormous behind the scenes intrigue that went on during the sad days of 1998. Some of the motivations, politics that went on - both on democratic and Republican side of the aisle - puts in a nutshell why the youngsters are repelled by body politic. Even if you are a politics junky who routinely watches house/senate sessions on CSPAN, you will still this book very interesting when all the politics are laid bare. It presents a contrast between how one of the truly historic moments of this country is handled by house leadership and that by Senate leadership in all its glory (or lack of it). I would recommend it for anyone interested in politics - the scheming and machinations with congress(house/senate), independant counsel's office and white house playing acting in their own self-interest, yet in some weird way validated the constitution of this great country."
4,A Strong Record of the events surrounding the 98 Impeachment,"The author states in the epilogue his desire to publish a objective record of the events surrounding the 1998 impeachment of President Clinton. He has done an admirable job. While he provides the reader a significant amount of behind the scenes information, the real value of this book is to provide a strong play by play of the impeachment. He rightfully stays away from sweeping judgements of either party. The most important aspect of this approach is to humanize all participants. Too often political leaders are demonized by the opposition. Bill Clinton, Henry Hyde, Bob Livingston, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott and many others are treated to a balanced review. If you are looking for a story of good versus evil (with either party playing either role), look elsewhere. Otherwise, I strongly recommend this book."
3,Pros and Cons,"ProsIt burns a DVD that is better than the original video. It is not that hard to set upConsExtremely difficult to use. It has 3 and I repeat 3 whole separate set of settings that have tons of choices of things to do. It is very complex and the manual is OK but there are so many things to do that it is hard to remember them all and there are I think 52 choices on the remote controlIt will not burn any kind of clip or anything that has any kind of decryption, no matter how short it is. I had some video clips on one video for a class and it wouldn't burn half of it.When it burns from TV, if you have a 16 x 9, it will leave grey outlines over both sides of the burned DVD. I have no idea why and I can't fix it.I got it as a free exchange from Best Buy but probably would not recommend buying it."
1,Barely lasts through warranty,We hardly used this DVD player & it lasted just long enough to pass the 6 month warranty -- then died.
1,THINK THE REVIEWS ARE GOOD?! ....THINK AGAIN!!!,"I am having the EXACT same problem as Tony Thiel. I received this DVD-recorder for Christmas. The first old home VHS movie I turned into a DVD was a success!! The next one I had a problem with, I turned it off for about 10 minutes... turned it back on, and it finalized with no problems. Last night I tried finalizing my 3rd DVD-R, and it wouldn't work!! It kept saying: ""This Operation Terminated because of an error on the disk."" I tried finalizing about 5 more times (after turning it off for a while inbetween each time) wasting hours!! I got so frusterated. I'm sending an application to return it to Amazon. Do not buy this product -- it will cause you trouble!!"
2,Won't finalize,"I bought this based on the reviews here. After getting the unit and trying the recommended DVD's I could not finalize DVD-R's.The DVD-RAM worked great, and I never tried the DVD-RW's.I returned the unit after creating at least 12 coasters withMemorex, and TDK DVDs."
4,Good Recorder for the money,"Just received this item to complete (for now) my home theatre system. The video quality looks sharp in 480p mode and the unit was very simple to connect, although figuring out how to actually record something from one of my many sources (Dish HD, Dish SD, VCR, DVD, PVR, etc...) may take a little extra time. One complaint I have is that the unit does not have a digital coax output for the audio feed...my A/V receiver DVD bus has ONLY a digital coax input...so I have to route the audio through a different optical input on the receiver which means I can't utilize the video pass through of the A/V receiver. Good thing HDTV monitors have lots of inputs...but switching between them will make my wife go insane!Anyway, good unit for the money and I'm looking forward to transferring years of video tapes onto DVD...."
4,Works great!,"I was a little wary of this machine based on the reviews by users who could not finalize their recordings. I had no such problem. I went to the local RiteAid and bought 25 Maxell DVD-R8x blanks and have recorded and finalized (you have to finalize to play it on another machine) six with no problem.I have a 56"" rear projection TV and if I want the recording to look just as sharp as the original, I have to use the XP (one hour per disk mode.) The two hour mode is good, but it is simply not as sharp a picture."
1,Could be made a lot better,Toshiba really blew it on this one. While the recorder records well the programming is anything but user friendly. Hit the controls and wait while the machine does something. You can't even shut the thing down in a reasonable time. Be prepared to wonder what is going on as you watch time pass. We are looking for the box to send this trash back to Japan.
2,FREE FIRM-WARE UPDATE FOR D-R4,"My unit like many others, broke after a few months. I was told by customer service that I would have to ship it in and pay 70.00 for a repair. Thankfully, I called back and got the help desk who informed me that there is a free firm-ware upgrade for this unit.They shipped it free, it took 30 seconds to install and the unit is working perfectly now. If it continues to work so well, I'll change my rating to 5 stars. Time will tell.I would highly recommend contacting Toshiba for this upgrade which is free. (I called the 800 # and pressed prompt #4)"
2,"Cute art, awful storytelling. Stick to Seasons of Mist.","I got this book as a present and was excited by the concept of Seasons of Mist from Death's perspective. Jill Thompson's drawings of the chibi-Endless are cute and entertaining, but all the attempts at humor in the writing fall flat. Since the story is from Death's perspective, most of the compelling parts of Seasons of Mist as seen by Morpheus are left out, and they aren't replaced with anything compelling. The story is simply a bunch of repetitive fluff with no point except to give Thompson a vague structure in which to show off her art. Death and all the other characters deserve better."
3,Stretching Sandman too far,"Death: At Death's Door is a retelling of the Sandman storyline Season of Mists. But this time the story is told from Dream's sister Death's point of view. Jill Thompson did a great job in the Sandman story The Parliament of Rooks applying a manga-influenced style to a short, two-and-a-half page tale, so I was looking forward to this book. She has again done a great job capturing the style of Japanese manga with her art and storytelling. But unfortunately, this Death's story is just too thin for the 200 pages.Get this book to complete your Sandman collection and for the great art. But this book is not a good introduction to Sandman nor a good stand-alone book."
2,Not even worth the paper it was printed on,"This manga is not worth reading, so you might as well get some value for the money you spent on it and make paper-mache, or perhaps crumple the pages to pad your Christmas gifts you will be sending in the mail. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! A newspaper is only 50 cents and will do the same thing!!! The only redeeming quality in this book is the cute main character, but she is not cute enough to keep this book from being tossed into the trash. I have a few hundred manga and have NEVER thrown a book away in my life- I may have to break that record thanks to this uber-crappy comic."
4,Straaaange,"Good stuff, Dark, melancholic, with a nice blend of electronic drums and rootsy guitars. My main point is that 58 minutes of music to my mind does not constitute an EP, this is a LP. Buy it if you like Crooked Finger, Bonnie Prince Billy, Tim Easton."
5,amazing!,"Went up to Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota last week with my camera gear in a pelican case.The Canoe tipped over, but my camera gear stayed nice and dry in this case.Awesome purchase. Saved my $$ gear.:)Rayana Adra"
2,Beware: NO Foam included!,"Received this item today, and was surprised to find out it does not come with the foam insert - quite unlike what the picture shows. Apparently I am going to now have to order separately - which kind of irks me, as I intended to use for kayak trip this coming weekend and now will not have the insert.Case itself looks good, seems durable. Wish Amazon/OpticsPlanet would make item description a little clearer (and not show photo with insert)."
4,very good value for my e39 bmw...,"I bought these to replace my old rotors on my E39 BMW. I paired them with ceramic ""dustless"" brakes. They work perfectly and Im happy with the results. only complaint is that the rotor's are showing superficial rust where the rotor meets the wheel. Again, Im very happy with the value."
4,easy to play,The game is easy to play. Similar to Pharaoh in how it is played yet seems very oriental.
5,"yes, it does work with Vista.","I have the old, original discs for Pharaoh and Cleopatra. I have always loved this game, and when I got a new PC with Vista I was concerned that it wouldn't play. I had lost track of my Cleopatra disc, but finally found it a few days ago and decided to see if it would install and play on my new computer.To my pleasant surprise, it did install and plays just fine. No crashes, no bugs, no glitches at all. The game plays just like it did on my old computer, and it's just as fun as I remember."
3,"good, but old","I like old games, i can deal with them. and if you can deal with them too, then i highly recommend it. If you like high end graphics type gaming, then don't consider buying it. IMPORTANT: if you have (64 bit) windows vista, this game will be full of problems. I never did work out all the problems and haven't yet played it on my computer. Fortunately, there are other computers in my house that can run this game so i was able to play it."
4,Gamer,"Loved this game, rec'd in a timely manor but Game seems to only install the Pharaoh part. I try and install the Expansion of Cleopatra and no luck. Dosent work I suggest to but them separately rather than together."
1,Can't run this title on Window 7,"Had this game for my 2004 Windwos XP system and it ran fine, no problems. When I tried to install it on my new Dell XPS8300 which runs Windows 7 (64bit) the game won't even install; I get as far as accepting the terms and conditions then did not go any further. So, in all, if you have an older machine which runs XP or older, it's a fun game, especially if you are, like me, a fan of city building genres."
4,Stones for Adults,"If you are a die hard Stones fan and also enjoy classical music, this is the CD for you, and will be unlike anything else in your music collection."
3,Forget the original Stones stuff--just enjoy for itself,"Interesting form of Stones music--definitely not for the Stones purist, but not bad if just taken as music to enjoy by itself."
2,One dimensional portrayal.,"I didn't read the book, so I can't compare the two. I have to admit this film seemed a bit disjointed at times, and didn't really show much of a pattern with Bundy. It came across more like stories sewn together. Sometimes that is okay, but I think it took away from this movie. Maybe even random comes to mind. It didn't really reveal how sick Ted Bundy was, and it was hard to feel much emotion with the storyline being so choppy. Dealing with a depraved individual I wasn't expecting to see details of his murderous spree, I expected to see those eyes which leave no doubt about this man. Even looking into this case on the internet, you see those ruthless eyes that reveal his true character. This film failed to show the many facets which a serial killer can have. While the ""other"" film on Ted Bundy made me very angry at Mark Harmon, this one just left me scratching my head."
3,not the worst movie in the world,"I've seen worse and I've seen better - this was not a terrible movie - though as one observer noted, like all made for tv movies - it lacks in quality when compared to big screen films. I love barbara hershey - and so i will watch most anything with her in it. the guy who played bundy was very, very good though - so worth watching just for him. the woman who ended up marrying him has some wonderful scenes as his long suffering wife and the final scene with her in which he talks about making a ""deal"" is excellent. enjoy it, but don't expect Kubrick or Scorsese"
1,The MOST inaccurate version of the Ted Bundy story I have seen.,"Having worked on Death row with Ted, speaking with him in great detail and reading almost every book about him, this version of his story is the worst I have seen in terms of accuracy. It's like they not only did not try to present the facts of the Bundy case accurately, they seemed to have tried (and succeeded) to present the story as fictitiously as possible. Some of the court scenes were sort of accurate, but not many. For something with Ann Rule's name on it, this is a total let-down."
3,"A nice try, but it just kind of laid there","While it didn't turn into a poor version of the Bundy tale, it never comes alive with any feeling. The Mark Harmon version of the story made in the 80's was far better and didn't feel the need to change so many of the facts around. The actors are good but there isn't the ""spark"" of compelling story telling here. Not bad ,but far from great."
4,a lot better than I thought,"after reading the reviews I bought the movie for 3 bucks and was very impressed. I wasn't expecting very much and it was a lot better than I thought it would be. It is not close to the book, but few movies are."
4,OK Ted Bundy Flick,"Not as good as the ""Deliberate Stranger"", better than ""Bundy: A Legacy of Evil"", around the same league as the movie simply called ""Ted Bundy"" made a few years back. A little bit ""fictionalized"", as in how the ""Boston Strangler"" movie was a fictionalized account of the true story, same goes for Ed Gein in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. Cambell plays Bundy rather well, and the woman playing Ms. Rule does her job as good also. However, having read just about everything on Ted (i'm from Starke, Fla where he was, um, ""fried""), the movie left out A LOT of Ted's nastier habits, like pedophilia, dismemberment, necrophilia & peeping tom-ism, but besides these minor faults, i liked the film, good if just for a ""passing watch"" or, if you are into true crime, serial killer stories or ""Lifetime""-like movies, than this is for you."
3,Not bad,"I thought the movie was quite well done, despite the inaccuracies and omissions. I watched the movie back-to-back with a Bundy documentary and did not find the movie as bad as other reviewers have noted. Still, if you're looking for a docu-drama, this isn't it. It's strictly a movie that's based on fact and if you keep that in mind, I think you'll like it."
3,TV movie,"Looks like a TV movie, quacks like a TV movie. So it must BE a TV movie. I don't know the facts behind the Ann Rule friendship with Ted Bundy, so I can't say if this is accurate. I'm sure a lot of nuance has been omitted. Still, it's spooky enough and moves along nicely."
4,Stranger rules the day!,This movie is based on the real life friendship between America's most famous serial killer and America's famous true crime writer. The movie states that this is her first book and that she did not know it was her coworker that was the serial killer that police were looking for. The story is told mostly from her side of the story and if you are expecting blood and guts then you will be disappointed. But if you are expecting a story that will have you thinking twice about the people you know then you have a winner here. Great acting and storytelling also will help keep you at the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this to all true crime fans!
4,Why? Why? Why?,"Well, why doesn't anybody in the US know the great German band Oomph? Is it because of bad marketing? Probably that's the reason, because their music is really excellent. Das Weiße Licht is a very good song from their wonderful album Plastik, and the single also includes four remixes by Headcrash, Camouflage, Cleen, and Schallbau. Not all of those are really good, but the Headcrash remix manages to be just as good as the original song (and we know that kind of remixes are hard to find, don't we?). So dig out your German dictionaries and order this CD now! Oomph deserves it to get as popular in the US as they already are in Germany!"
5,Garden Primitives anything but primitive,"Sosin's first effort was surely worth the effort. The writer has struck a chord with her lovely imagery and her straightforward diction. She mesmerizes with her blend of the common and the dazzling, especially in her story of the gyn model. Every woman will connect here and every doctor NEEDS her insight. The title of the collection hides the fact that these stories, while natually inspired, are anything but primitive. This is fiction of the best kind possible: humorous and all at once compelling from a deeply societal level. Brava! What we need is more from this author."
4,Satisfied Mouse User,"The best thing is the fit, very comfortable. The ability to turn off the mouse is a definite plus. Recharging while in use is very useful although it does require two USB slots."
2,"well it works, some what","the rechargeable batteries don't seem to hold a charge for more that a few hours, i been thinking of putting better ones in it to see if that well fix it."
3,oddly shaped cone but it balances ok,"The 'steps' on the cone for resting the center hole of a lawn mower blade are some very odd sizes. It's the perfect fit for one blade I have, but for many other blades there is no perfect step for them to rest on. I had a heck of a time to balance one blade - it doesn't have a perfect hole in the center; the opening is a weird shape and relies on the center hole of the bottom metal bracket along with the mounting surface to center the blade in the lawn mower.After some very meticulous adjustments trying to balance the blade on the cone itself, I was finally able to get the blade and cone to balance on the base as it should.When this thing works, it is quite sensitive (a good thing). Plastic feels kinda cheap so I must be very careful."
2,blade balancer didn't fit my blade,"The balancer is a very simple plastic thing that probably would have worked IF it was designed for John Deere blades for my 42"" riding lawn tractor. Problem is, the balancer has many steps in the cone that needs to fit into the center hole in the blade to work. The hole size on my blades didn't fit any of the balancer steps so the product did not work for me."
1,Flimsy and difficult to use,Very light weight and tended to move as you cut. The bow knife cut very thin and uneven slices on crusty bread. One friend used it and said his bow knife was much easier to use as the bow was larger and cut thicker slices. We had a crusty baquette that we gave up on and used bread knife. Also had a label stuck on top of cutting surface that left sticky goo.
4,Solid entry in the Moonworlds saga,"More sedately paced and less focused than Voyage of the Shadowmoon, but still an enjoyable read. Includes characters from the first book (Terikel & Velander play fairly substantial parts), but I was hoping for more from Laron.This is the second book I've read by McMullen and, while I can't say I laughed out loud, I do appreciate the humor and lightness of the fantasy - a good counterbalance to some of the dark, grim fantasies out there. The humor is similar to Glen Cook or Lawrence Watt-Evans (who also happen to be two of my favorite authors)."
2,I agree with fellow reviewer...,"I got a mixed CD called ""ThriveMix 1"" and this track was on there. it was a Benny Benassi mix, but only ran 3 minutes before mixing out. So I thought I'd hunt down the CD single...the benassi mix isn't even on here! What a letdown. If you want to hear it, you'll have to invest in ""ThriveMix 1"", which has some great gems on it, although overall it has other problems which i describe in my review of that disc."
5,10 Stars,Every african american home should have this book. Great addition to my book collection. Beautiful book and very educational. My 15 year old find it very interesting.

5,"In Vedic joy, a traveller visits ancient inner sources.","Where did this come from? This tidbit of text mesmerizes from the first sentence. Here is real spiritual experience palpable as Castenda's, but in the classsic Vedic reference frame. The mythic encounter becomes its own parable, with the feel of channels such as Kryon, Michael or Seth. Let us hope the presses are running again soon, so seekers of new cosmic insight may be enlightened by the profound inner research of Lorenzo Caravella"
3,Data Mining put in context,This book contains descriptions of the most common data mining techniques and examples of how they can be applied in different industries with real case studies.It's a good book if you want to have an overview of data mining and get some ideas about how to use it and it covers a quite a broad perspective and is very much uptodate. I would maybe have prefered a book which was more like a reference guide for practical every-day-use.
5,I love this cd.,"After seeing their labelmates the Explosion twice and overlooking them many times, my best friend finally made me listen to the Static Age. I was blown away.This album is better than anything that has been recorded in the past 5 years. The Static Age has such a unique sound and Andrew Paley's voice will blow you away.Buy this album, and disregard anything negative that has been said about it. It is wonderful."
2,review from the Synthesis,"Forty-two minutes of uninteresting `80s pop in the vein of Peter Gabriel and the Cure isn't my idea of an exciting time. This marriage between the two is an unholy and dull attempt to recreate that post-goth, post-emo dance-y sound that kids with too much black eyeliner like. From start to finish, the Static Age create a layered atmospheric sound using synths, delayed guitars and modulated bass; however, nothing sticks out. Of the nine tracks on Neon Nights Electric Lives, two have been remixed. The AFI cult will eat this up since Jade Puget remixes one of the songs. In conclusion: there is no reason to listen to this unless you want something to pass out to when you're drunk at 4 AM.- Matt KiserSynthesis.net"
2,JUNK,After many happy years with a Sevylor Classic I needed a new inflatable kayak and with Sevylor temporarily out of business I got the Coleman; bad mistake. It felt flimsy and didn't handle well at all. Just avoiding subsurface rocks on a slow moving creek was an exercise in frustration and I'm darn glad I didn't try the class 2 rapids I used to enjoy in the Sevylor. Can't straighten my legs out with that attached front seat in the way either so I was uncomfortable as well. One miserable twelve mile trip and I haven't touched it since.
2,Tough going,Used this one summer at a lake in the Adirondacks NY. Very difficult to paddle. Kids wanted to be towed.
3,Ho-Hum,This book is about a girl named Amelia who is forced into marriage with a depraved Earl. She runs away from him only to realize he is the only one who can truly satify her. The motivations of Ms. Johnson's(the author) characters are thin. As a reader it's hard to believe that people are as irrational as the author would have us believe. And the sex wasn't that great either.
4,emerging from the ashes,"I have to admit, I was thrilled by the first three chapters of this book- our good friend Lestat had me laughing out loud! And then, regrettably, it slooowed down, not to really regain momentum until the last 100 pages or so. However, having said that (and I do consider myself an avid fan) this book is an improvement over Armand and Blood and Gold. (I, personally, DID like Merrick...). But, one of the joys of Anne's writing is that you can read her books over and over again, and always find something interesting. As I've read B.F. over, it has consistantly grown on me, so much so that today I actually stopped halfway through and decided I really DID like Quinn! My advice to a new reader- enjoy the beginning and the end, and suffer through the middle. I look forward to see the October's offering."
3,"Oh Anne, please return to your glory","First things first, this book was waaay too short (like by 1/2!) I felt like the entire thing was on fast forward and that she was just going through the motions. The characters were, or rather could be, interesting and the story line need a lot of meat. Witching Hour fans will be glad to see more Mayfair madness in this one, and we finally get somewhere with the Talamasca debacle but past that, not much happens. The book was formulaic and forced at times, she was telling a lot more than showing and Quinn is a hard character to swallow. But this is a common problem with her younger characters, they lack youth, and therefore are unconvincing. Petronia is a really intriguing character though, and I wish that there had been more attention upon ""it"". Overall though, its Rice, and even at her worst she would still be one of the most talented writers out there today, so read the book and love it, but see that it is a shadow of what it could have been."
5,Life lived on the Blackwood farm,"This is a beautiful story. It has everything a great story should have. Family, friendship, love, sex and supernatural beings of all sorts. Not to mention a perfect storyline. I don't think you would need to be an anne rice fan to enjoy this book."
3,Good and bad,"This is definitely not as good as the earlier vampire or Mayfair Witch books. This book was very descriptive, in fact at times I felt it was too descriptive. The paragraphs would be really short (so would the book) if the unnecessary description were removed. I was happy to have Lestat back in the spotlight again as I missed the character. That was about the only thing that I really liked. Otherwise, this book was pretty long in my opinion to have such little going on in it. It wasn't a bad book, and if it had been by another author it might have even registered in my mind as a really great book, but I have come to expect a lot out of Anne Rice and for her, this was disappointing. I still recommend it if you are a fan of her other series and would like to continue the tradition. Not the best by this author."
5,Finally!!!,"This book, in my opinion, is the best of the Vampire Chronicles since the first three. Second only to Interview with the Vampire. It leaves out pretty much all of the regular vampires ( of course Lestat is a main character ) but introduces a new one who is more interesting than even Lestat himself ( most of the otherr vampires are though from my point of view ). This is a definite read for any of Rice's fans, even if you were dissapointed with the last several, or newcomer's to the vampire chronicles."
4,Blackwood Farm,"I have to say that I am a devout fan of Anne Rice. As an avid reader, I must say that when it comes to turning the last page of one of Anne Rice novels, I can just barely bring myself to do it. She has such a profound way of snaring my attention and holding on until I can barely gasp for breath.To no such surprise she has done it agian. This book was great! I adore Tarquin and his honesty. (Though, Lestat still being the absolute.)Anne Rice has the nac for story telling and you can truly marvel the depth of it in this book!"
1,The worst,"As far as this story goes I read it because a friend told me Lestat was in it. And being a long time fan of the Vampire Chronicle novels up too and including ""Body Thief,"" which is undoubtedly one of my most favorite. I found that yes indeed the brat prince is there.However I found our Lestat to be quite the disappointment when not presented in the first person. I also found the story to be uninteresting and written like a first draft which had not been checked over afterwards by the author. There was one page in particular I took note of where nearly every single sentence began with the same exact word. Something that gave it an extremely repetitive sound which I encountered time and again throughout.It was at about halfway through this book that I closed the cover, and have never picked it up since, having completely given up trying to get any enjoyment out of it at all.A sore disappointment indeed, wanted to give it no stars but apparently you have to give it one to post."
4,Great addition to legacy of the Vampire Lestat,Story: Its a pretty good story. I wish there were more action and fights between the vampires. But its great to see the interaction between Ann Rice's Mayfair witch books and Vampire chronicle books. Its a great addition to the other vampire books. But it doesn't surpass any of the previous books.Characters: Lestat as always is my favorite vampire character. Its about time that Lestat finds someone who loves him back.I hope the next Lestat book will have more action and drama in it like vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned books. They were the best of Ann Rice.
3,I miss the old Lestat...,"I was so excited for this novel, but upon reading it, I found it dissapointed, though I didnt want to admit it because I try to relish everything Anne writes. However, my favorite character perhaps in the history of literature, Lestat, was utterly wasted here I felt. I was truly sad for it. Oh well, at least I can always go back and reread (yet again) the older Vampire novels."
3,I HOPE IT GETS BETTER,I am just starting chapter 10 of this novel and I must say I have almost put it down several times. I love Anne Rice. I love the Mayfairs and the Vampires but I am getting so bored with Quinns backstory. I have have read several reader reviews and am holding out hope that this book picks up soon. This book is not fast paced enough for me and it lacks the mystery that nornally would keep me interested. If it doesn't change in the next couple of chapters I will have to move on to something els and I bet I will miss out on a book that could have turned out great if it just had started sooner.
3,Arg...not again.,"At the end of the book I was left with the horrible realisation of how close the whole vampire ""Troop of beloveds"" are to holding hands and singing Kumbaya around a campfire.I mean, it's been going down hill ever since Vampire Armand with ever so more apparent oozing of christian underlines in the storylines."
4,new to Anne,"somehow, in my already well past middle age, i have missed reading Anne Rice. Blackwood Farm was my first book, picked up as a last resort before a trip. not having had the experience of reading her other books, i enjoyed this story. i enjoyed it enough to go back and begin the Vampire Chronicles from the beginning. i can see how the number of books in the series might lead to some of the stories getting repetitive and old. that is common in a long series. so far, and not having gotten far in the stack, i am enjoying them.i can recommend Blackwood Farm as a stand alone, or as an introduction to Anne Rice and her writings. from there...you are on your own! :-)"
4,Loved this book!,This was the first Anne Rice book that I ever read and I was immediately hooked. Her prose is so beautiful. Start with the Vampire Lestat and move through all the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches. You'll love them.
2,Another Sad Let-Down to add to Anne's ever-growing list.,".....Okay, here's the deal. The book was mildly entertaining. I kept waiting for something good to happen. Ms. Rice almost did something cool here. She really could have, and if you've read the excerpt available here you know what I'm referring to. But in the end she took the easy way out, the same way her characters solve too many problems by throwing wads of cash around.Now that it's over I just keep fighting the urge to pick the book back up to see if there's something I missed. Some important key moment that didn't sink in. But I don't really believe that's possible, and the truth is that unlike many of Ms. Rice's earlier works, I'll probably never pick this book up again. ...."
1,"Sure I'm Dead, But I'm Rich!","Used to be, Rice's books had narrative, thrills, and even some decent writing. Now, she is in thrall to a sort of materialistic version of porn, and a view of the South that - if it ever existed as she writes it (and I'm a Southerner) - died out 72 years ago. Am I the only one troubled that, when the narrator is grieving over the death of his dearest friend, he takes pains to mention that he rode to her funeral in the deceased's ""luxurious limousine?"" Welcome to ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Undead."" Oh, and by the way, the story is awful, and no character is real."
3,You have to read it...,"SPOILER:If you are a follower of her Vampire and Mayfair series and I am. This novel provides some interesting updates about the Mayfair Clan. But far more interesting than the Over The Top Quinn and Get Over Yourself Mona are Oncle Julian and Aunt Queen. Let's follow Julian around for awhile and I want to hear all about Aunt Queen. Leave Quinn alone until he grows up or something! Check out this review. He says it better than I could: http://www.ruthlessreviews.com/blackwoodfarm.htmlThe romance between Quinn and Mona was straight from a Teen Romance Magazine (if there is such a thing). Ho hum.Ms Rice, I do love your books, but the moment we met Mona, we knew she'd become a Vampire. Write Oncle Julian and Aunt Queen's story. But before you do find some way to renew, reinvent, reinstate, and reclaim your writing self. Your fans would welcome you back with open arms."
4,A Terrific Blend of Southern Hospitality and Ghastly Horror!,"Although This novel is my favorite by Anne Rice, I cannot argue that she has done better, i.e. Interview, and Memnoch. But this Story definitely draws you in with a mixture of her tales of the Vampires, Witches, and even Ghosts... Readers will not be dissappointed with the main characters, Qiunn, quest for Freedom from Goblin, love for Mona, and struggle to please Aunt Queen. Even though this Book is slightly longer than her other Chronicles, Anne really should have delved a little longer with her story line. Readers will finish this exciting novel itching for a more Concrete ending. But i guess thats why we all have to wait and read Blood Canticle...."
4,Not bad at all,"It was with some trepidation that I started Blackwood Farm, since the last few entries in the Vampire Chronicles were kind of weak, especially compared to the earliest ones. But I was pleasantly surprised. What I liked best about it was what the most recent previous reviewers seemed to object to the most. It was't about Lestat whose only role is basically that of an audience to the story of young Quinn Blackwood's life as Quinn relates it to Lestat whom he has awakened in order to ask for help in getting rid of an increasingly malignant spirit.This is clearly the begining of a new story line that I expect will continue for one or more additional books in which Rice intends to marry (perhaps literally) the Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair witch saga. I liked it and look forward to the continuation."
1,I loved all of the Vampire Chronicles except for that one,"I read all of the Vampire Chronicals books that Anne Rice as written and loved them all, and of course when this last book of her came out I bought it right away, I only read the first 100 pages of the book, I couldn't read anymore after that, I never was able to get into the story and the character of the book I could care less about his life and the rest of his family, even with Lestat in the book this book was doom to fail.Sorry Anne but not bying anymore of your book after that one."
3,Vampire chronicles continue,loved the new twist and the new characters!!! love the blending of the mayfair witches and the vampires....would recomend to any vampire or anne rice fan...
3,Predictable,"While this installment advances the story line of the series, there was no mystery as to how it would end. Perhaps there doesn't need to be, but I would have liked to experience more of a sense of revelation, rather than that of inevitability. It seems that Mrs. Rice was simply fulfilling an obligation rather than delighting in this one."
1,My least favorite of the series,"I enjoy most of Anne's characters but after being introduced to Merrick (which I liked and enjoyed)I guess I expected too much. I could not bring myself to be even remotely interested in the character Quinn, he seemed to similar to Louis but with an even more depressing back story , but yet no where near as interesting. Also I was very excited to find the Mayfair witches and the Vampire Chronicles were being brought together, but quickly realized I perfered them separate as something is just lost in the translation of the characters."
1,A disappointing addition to the Chronicles,"I've read every book in the Chronicles up to this point, and to be honest, this one was so awful I couldn't finish it. I found myself being bored by Quinn's excrutiating detail of his early life before being a vampire. And what happened to Lestat? He's not the same character anymore. He use to be so alluring and attractive. Now he's just annoying and over-done. Quinn's life was just too over-the-top, as was Marius's life in ""Blood and Gold."" I don't think Rice has written a good book in at least ten years. She's sold out!"
2,"been done before, been done better","There was a time when I was an avid fan of Anne Rice's work. I love the Mayfair Witches and the Vampire Chronicles. This work just didn't do it for me. I liked it slightly because I am a big fan of gothic stories and it's nice to know what it going on in the current lives of the Mayfair Witches but mostly Rice is just going over old material, stuff that's been done before by her and done better by her."
1,ANNE! GET AN EDITOR!,"I'm so tired of the over blown writing of Anne Rice. I am big die hard fan but every book she writes I seemed to have less faith. Why doesn't she get it that we don't care for the new characters (who gives a hoot of ""Goblin and Quinn"")that she constantly writes about(except Merrick, that was very good). All we care for are the vampires we came to love since the first few books! I want to hear about ""Lestat"" and his stories, ""Louie's"" adventures. I'm also tired of Anne not using an editor for her books. She has great ideas if only she would let someone edit her books as it was done in the past, then they would make more sense to read! Without one she just rambles and rambles on and on! Why let us read the Letter to ""Lestat"" in this story if ""Quinn"" will mention the same damn letter to ""Lestat"" AGAIN! She just repeats the words over and over, till you're mad! I really dreading her next book. ANNE STOP THE MADNESS!!!"
5,Classic Anne Rice- Beautifly Predictable; Visciously Sweet!,"I Totally enjoyed the character Quinn and his appreciation & Respect for LeStat and his Dominance of New Orleans; The LeStat/Quinn relationship is a very seducing and enjoyable affair ecspecially when you add the young Mayfair witch which creates an insatiable Trifecta of power and Seduction in a Symphony of love.The Blackwood Grandfather, Father, Uncle roles are a bit creative and the Drag Queen Vampire is odd, evil and typical Anne Rice to throw us a very unique curveball likeable or not, but still very worth the read, Just has to fit the specific taste of the individual.In all, a GREAT A.R Book which is sorely mis-understood along with another favorite of mine is Memnoch the Devil.I hope this helps!Kawika G.D. Horn"
5,Loved the story,"I loved this story. Quinn is a lovable character although very emotional and a bit crazy. I liked the ending of it. It has scenes and ideas that some may find shocking or uncomfortable. If you enjoy Anne Rice's vampire books, then I think you'll enjoy this one. Kindle edition has some issues with non alpha-numerical characters displaying correctly but is readable."
1,BORING,"I really can't describe it any other way. Believe it or not, I am a big Anne Rice fan. The truth is this book is boring. My hope is that perhaps......it's the setting for the next book which will be absolutely FABULOUS....my fingers are crossed."
1,Forgot How Bad this book is,"I am pals with Anne Rice on facebook. yeah.. me and everyone else! Of course she is talking about the looming publication date on Angel Time and I was thinking of pre-ordering it so I was checking things out. I had totally forgotten that I had read this dreadful book until I re-read the plot outline and it came back to me in a gushy flash of how terrible this novel was. Even if you are an Anne Rice fan do not be tempted to buy this one, even if there a cheap used copies floating around.And I think I will wait on her new novel to see what the reviews are!"
5,Now This was A Good Book,"Man, I have been looking for a book to read that just takes you on a journey. This was the book, I read it non-stop. I was so happy to be reading another Anne Rice book, that made me laugh,get a surprise, and talk out loud. It just so happens I read Blood Canticle before this one so I had to go back and read dear Quinn's tales of woe. Damn he had nothing to complain about he was a rich, spoiled brat, very much like Lesat, that could be what lead to the attraction. This book was a joy of words, and I wished there was more. I've got my fingers crossed."
2,Disappointing,"Killing Merrick, one of the most fascinating of Rice's characters, ruined the novel for me. Quinn isn't really a sympathetic character. I got the feeling Ms. Rice just had a deadline to meet. Re-read ""Interview With The Vampire"" instead."
5,Blackwood Farm,Anne Rice just keeps getting better! I sincerely hope that she's already at work on her next book -- I can't wait to hear more of Mona and Quinn.
3,Lestat is back! Well...sort of.,"Blackwood Farm is far superior to Blood and Gold, which is the single worst book ever written.I was very excited by the beginning of this book, but the middle gave out. The ending is suberb, and I was truly shocked by the death of one major character.Here is my advice:If you are a Lestat fan as I am, (I really don't care about any of Rice's other characters) you should read Chapters 1-6, skip chapters 7-43, and then read chapters 44 thru the end of the book.If you are a Mayfair fan, read the entire thing. You will probably enjoy those middle 400 pages that I didn't.Hopefully Blood Canticle, the next Rice book, will be about Lestat and no one else."
3,Seems the soap opera of the vampires continues.....,"Finally, we get a good book with a soap opera ending. Wait until the next episode..... The entrance into the ""Dark World"" was just sick, but by that point I really cared about the characters in the book. Good read, not great."
5,Utterly Engulfing,"Again, I'm spellbound and drawn into a world by Anne Rice's ability to manipulate language and craft meer words into a tale that is utterly engulfing. The only sorrowful part is that it has to end.Emphatically enjoyed. Absolutely recommended."
3,Great book yet to short were it counts,I just got done reading Black Wood Farms and my opinions on it are mixed I thought at the begining of the book it was to long but mid book it started to get really to the point were I couldnt put it down yet I felt that the end was to short and hope there is another installment on this character. This book has alot of symbolic accurences that were suddel(very) yet made the book all the better. All in all I give this book a 3.5 and recommend it
2,First book I didn't finish in quite some time,"If you're into homo-eroticism... then this book is for you. If you're not into homo-eroticism... then there are approximately 2.2 trillion more books out there that you would probably like better. They may not all be at your local book store, but they're probably worth searching for online rather than buying this off the shelf. Beyond the excruciatingly vivid details of homo-eroticism, there are even more excruciatingly vivid details of Quinn's life that leave you feeling drained and wondering what's on tv?"
4,Finally....,"a book from Ms. Rice that is well worth reading. The last two books I read of hers were extremely tedious (The Vampire Armand and Blood & Gold). I love the Mayfair Witches and most of the Vampire Chronicles. I really liked this book and the way she intertwined the vampires and the witches. I eagerly anticipate her newest book out in October 2003, Blood Canticle."
3,(Actually 3.5 stars) A good read,"The book was actually pretty good, however what perturbed me was that Quinn wasn't a good father to his son he just went off with Mona Mayfair, why is that. He has a son to take care of for ChristsSake! But over all it was a good book. Some parts are a bit graphic but like I said it was a good book.There are some good sex scenes all around and kinda sad with Mona but.... Well you'd just have to read Blood Canticle now don't you. Well Blah I have nothing else to say, I hope this was a good review to y'all."
2,get real,"even for Anne Rice, this one is bit over the top. the main character is foppish and ridiculous. trust me, rich 18 yr. old boys in south Louisana DO NOT sleep (as chaste bedfellows) with the family help. give me a break. some of the dialogue was utterly absurd. this is some sort of pathetic caricature of southern life. NOT one of her best accomplishments."
1,Stan read it and now look! She should stop writing!,After Armand she went downhill. I am done with her!
1,Sad old Rice,I did not like this book - did not even finish the first page. I am glad I did not waste my money on it - a friend loaned it to me and it was quickly returned. I do not care for Anne Rice books and feel that none of them are worth wasting my time as there are other Vampire novels that are better written and have more of a soul to them. Anne Rice just leaves me sad and tired.
1,Only to be read by masochists!,Good heavens! This had to be one of the most painful books I've ever read! I felt like I was being punished for deciding to finish the damned thing once I started it. The text and dialogue were repetitive to the point of irritation and the characters were flat. Must every line of the book be so melodramatic - it makes the parts of the book that might be exiciting rather anticlimactic.
1,Who Wrote This Book??,"I have read every single book Anne Rice has written, some were fantastic and some not so great but still I remained a devoted fan. I am now wondering if there is a reason to continue reading her books any more. The book was good up until about the point Quinn meets Mona then something horrible happened to the writing. It was as if someone else started writing - maybe a 12 year old? The dialouge became completely unbelievable and painful to read. I am almost near the end and will finish it because I came this far already but nearly every page is causing me to cringe. I am in shock at how poor this book is. I can hardly believe that Anne Rice wrote this book. I am so sad."
5,You won't be disappointed,"After reading Anne Rice novels, every book that I read thereafter seems dull and uninteresting. And after reading this book there was no exception. But I highly recommend reading her witch novels before entering into this book. She takes you into a world of grace and sophistaction. Wonderful read."
4,Sheeee's baaaaaack!,"Blackwood Farm, is splendid. It's one of the best books that Anne has written in along while. For all of you readers out there that have come to hate the new chronicles, you'll love this. Tarquin Blackwood is an enchanting character, not since Louis has there been one so delicious as he. In fact the only faults that I can say about this book was that it didn't include my beloved, tortured Louis, and that its' ending was rather...not rushed, for it wasn't, but it ended too soon, leaving me blinking at the last sentence, disbelievingly.But what else can I say? It's good to have the Brat Prince back.^^"
4,Excellent!,"This book was thrilling there is no word to describe it...I was entertained every moment of it.I think this is probably one of the best in the series and the only reason it is not getting five stars is because it had an equal amount of the mayfair and vampire chronicles in it,so therefore it should not be part of the vampire chronicles!But for what it is,it is damn good.I think it should be a ""solo"" novel...I definitely would recommend it...If you haven't read it,they what are you waiting on,don't miss out on the fun..hurry...I could say so much about it but I don't want to give away any part of it...I can say surely that there is a new character whose history and story will blow you away...Welcome to the world of Anne Rice(for those new readers out there)"
2,Better than most of her recent works,"Which, of course, isn't saying much.Is she really in such desperate need of money that she needs to give us yet another book that's clearly only half finished?"
2,"Long on statistics, short on insight","Long on statistics, short on insight., August 29, 1999Rather dry. Not very much that you couldn't figure out by yourself; notmuch original insight. The author uses statistics throughout to thepoint that it almost becomes meaningless. Anyone with the most limitedexperience with statistics knows that you can make them say just aboutanything you want.What I had hoped for was some insight into why there is so mucheconomic disparity in this country and what we can, or should, do aboutit. Instead the author gave more of a status quo, ""we are here,""appoach.The last chapter was maybe the most insteresting. It focused on theeconomic changes in the US since WW2. It is anybody's guess what thefuture will bring, but it seems like it will continue as it is nowuntil there is some big crash or other disaster."
2,really disliked the book,Really disliked this book. I was not a fan of the writing style and struggled all the way through the book. It would not be something I would recommend even to someone doing a life sentence.
5,"This is NOT ""Talking in Church""","Another example of screwed up Latin American politics and corruption with a required lack of understanding for the first hundred pages or so.If you aren't used to non-linear story telling: linear - this happened, then this happened, then.....;non-linear - this happened (sometime); this happened (some other time - maybe earlier, maybe later); this happened (could be later, could be sooner than anything else, could be any time in between, maybe). Simple - after 600 pages if you haven't figured it out it doesn't really matter - you've had a hell of a trip anyway.Sound like I'm being negative? I'm not - it was a blast. There are some real stinkers in here - and I liked some of them, disliked some and pretty much didn't care about the others.This book is pretty heavy and bleak. You can read the Amazon description. If you are already in a bad mood, save this one for later. Imitation of the characters is not a healthy form of flattery or living."
3,Clever observation of Peruvian society,"According to Mario Vargas Llosa, this is the only book he'd save in case he had to burn all his books. I personally enjoyed more ""The feast of the goat"" although the story is closely related. Both talk about Latin American dictatorships and everyday life as seen from the point of view of the elites (in this case the Zavala family) and of the ""less-privileged"" (Ambrosio, in the story). The book basically describes the different stages of Santiago Zavala's life from his teenage years to adulthood. He's a bohemian, who never finds his ""place in the world"" and sometimes seems very dull.The novel is written in a very complex way because in some chapters the dialogs of the characters are mixed up and you have to be very concentranted to understand who's talking to whom."
3,"A Struggle, but Worth It","This was probably not the best choice for my first try at Latin American literature. Not to be critical of MVL, but I struggled with this book. The most difficult part was how the dialogue skips without notice between scenes back and forth in time, and between different characters. I caught on about 200 hundred pages in, but it was still a struggle. Having said that, it is an interesting and engaging novel of Peru and Latin American recent history in general. This author is fairly objective in presenting the history versus some authors who lean drastically to the right or left. I'm looking forward to reading more MVL. Unless you are experienced with this type of writing be prepared for a difficult but worthwhile read."
1,Ships in 3-5 Weeks,"I have no doubt that these are excellent plastic gloves as the product description would have you believe. However, you have to wait 3 to 5 weeks before they arrive. I am still waiting on this item, more than a month later. I ordered this product to make up the missing 89 cents I needed to qualify for ""FREE supersaver shipping."" Needless to say, at the time I placed my order I did not notice the shipping delay. If you actually need plastic gloves, I'd recommend going to the drugstore or ordering from a company that has more reasonable shipping times. If you're trying to get free shipping, just realize that it isn't exactally free."
5,From clouds to cockroaches,Why is this Cd still the most expensive. Because these performances are still by far the best interpretation of the Bartok quartets I have heard. No.4 is my favorite with the driving Allegro start and finish. I've lived through many years of growth with these recordings and I would like to thank The Linseys and of course Bartok for offering a musical creation of such breadth.
4,Secret of Old Zeb,"Carmen Deedy has created another great book with imagination, cleverness and a wonderful message. I have read this to 4th grade classes who enjoyed it tremendously. However, reading it aloud does not allow the students to see the play on words she uses in the text, nor to appreciate the wonderful illustrations.My 8 year old granddaughter, Ginny, found these especially delightful when she read Zeb!"
4,So Pretty,"The color of the actual polish is a little different than what is pictured, but is still a very pretty color."
3,Great color... not the same of the picture,"This is a great color, but no the same as the picture. In the picture looks as a green-blue, but it is completely blue (satin)... for me was dissapointed, but as I say before, the color is great anyway and it is good quality."
5,Youngblood Pressed Mineral Foundation,"Well, seeing as I've bought this for the past few years now and felt no need to replace it with a different powder, it's doing its job very well. I wear very light coverage and this is incredibly light while at the same time help my skin look more even toned. I'm allergic to so many products out there but I have no issues with this. I can sleep with this one and don't wake up with any rashes. Good stuff."
5,Lafferty is something you should try.,"Even very old, Lafferty is special. It's a short read, but good.I need eight more words to submit this."
4,Good short story,I enjoyed this short story. It is difficult to find stories by R.L. Lafferty. Hopefully this will change soon since Locus bought the copyrights to his works late last year.
1,10 dollars?,Please be aware that this is most likely just a cheap reprint of the out of copyright short story available on Project Gutenberg (for free).
2,Gutted in no time flat,I sent for this toy because in the past our black lab could not destroy one in two years. Our puggle gutted it in hours. I wonder if the quality is less.
4,Very good Russian-Finnish fantasy,"A legendary sailor named Sinbad returns to his village but he notices that the town is unhappy as he travels on to find the legendary bird of happiness as he with his crew fight off vikings, meet India natives and even deal with the ruler of the oceans to find that bird.A very good Russian-Finnish co-production fantasy tale that didn't deserved the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment! in 1963 Roger Corman brought it in the USA in a cut and poorly dubbed version and now the uncut russian version is to be seen. I should say the acting is quite good and the production values are terrific, there is some nifty special effects for it's time considering it's a foreign production. MST3K did a good job riffing this movie but they all admit that this was a good movie but they saw a poorly dubbed cut version."
4,A good read,"I found Bradley G. Bond's documentary to be very much in line with other accounts I've read concerning the history of my home state. Some facts, many facts, are ugly to look at but he presented them without bias, in my opinion. But even he acknowledged that bias is unavoidable due to the unavoidable requirement to decide which material to include and which material to exclude. Some might be angry at some of the material he included regarding our recent state flag debate or references to how bad we lag the nation in education. But we should be angry at that - because it is true.I found the book to be an interesting read and even learned some things about the state I've lived in for over forty years. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about Mississippi."
1,The watch does not run.,Bought this with gift card. I have another guess watch that the battery died on. It was less expensive to buy a new one than send the watch bk fir a battery replacement. The bad us vey wide but fits. The watch ticked for about ten hours then die.
2,Worst Book of the Series,"I've read all of the books in this series, and my conclusion is that this is the worst. The emails that are prevalent in the book make the girl seem 11 or 12, not 17 like she is supposed to be. I never liked the character and I thought that the author didn't do a good job of conveying French culture as much as she could have. I far prefer the other books in this series over this one. This book might be better for 11 or 12-year-old girls but not older teens. The book wasn't terrible, but it wasn't that much fun to read."
5,Women's work,"I am quite interested in the historical textile arts and this book was highly recommended. Imagine my pleasure to note that it's not only about textiles, but also about womens roles in society. I haven't finished it yet but it's a very engrossing read. It combines all my favorite things, some archeology, history, and fiber."
5,Thank you!!,"I always assumed that the sexual division of labor made sense at one time in history. Barber has researched and illuminated one aspect of the division, and through archeology and linguistics explained the importance the women's work had at one time, and what happened to it. And made it interesting, too. Thank you."
5,Extremely Inspisrational,Louie has some of the most inspirational an thought provoking sermons I have ever heard. He is truly anointed!
1,File holder,Disappointed because it would not fit in my file drawer without extending the files too high. You need to give the dimensions.
2,An introduction to the study of Human Communication,It was not the right addition of the book that was pictured and ordered. She would not offer a return. I would not recommend this buyer.
4,Great product,"Loved this tabletop chocolate fountain. Used it for a graduation party and the recommended serving of 24oz of chocolate was just enough for approx. 40 guests. All my guests were so impressed with it! A bit tedious to clean, but not too bad considering all the fun everyone had dipping fruit, rice krispy treats, and marshmallows."
4,Superb book,"This book provides the best English language description of the organization and technical details of the Maginot Line currently available. This is not a guidebook to the Maginot Line, but if you are lucky enough to visit, it will help you to understand alot of the things you will see. It is not a detailed account of the battles, there are other books in French that do that. If you are interested in Strategy and Tactics, it will help you to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the Maginot Line and their influence on what actually happened."
2,Starforce Warning!,"This game comes with a version of starforce that wouldn't let my CDRW read anything for as long as it was installed. The game was decent enough and played well, but my drive wouldn't recognize any other CD until I uninstalled the game and ran the starforce removal tool. Then everything was back to normal. It's a definite problem if you want to do more with your CPU than play this game and the ""more"" involves using your CDRW. I have an older system (Dell 8250, P4, 3GHZ) and someone with more up-to-date hardware might not experience the same problem. I understand starforce messes with older drives and not the new ones. So gamble if you like. As I said, the game is very decent if you are into naval warfare."
1,Disaster of a game,"Bought game at Amazon. Installed. Tried to run game. Takes almost as long for game to verify game disk as it did to install it. Game then refuses to run because it claims I don't have a valid game disk. See above, where I got this game from Amazon. The game might be fun -- I'll never know. Tried to install twice, no luck. I'm running Windows XP, so that shouldn't be a problem. Their game is so secure that they won't let people play it, I guess."
3,"Washable, eradicable blue ink; one of the most popular blues","This ink is washable, so parents can give it to kids without worrying. It is one of the most popular blue inks for fountain pens because of its hue and shade. It can be eradicated by sulfate-sulfite eradicators like the Pelikan Super Pirat, which is convenient for students."
5,"Excellent, full recording.","Ludford uses the same plainchant for both works, but the voicing has a distinct emphasis at the lower end of the range, not only adding to the weight but also bringing a certain darkness to the sonority. The performance has the same spontaneous feeling that distinguishes this magnificent series through out, and it confirms Ludford as one of the most emotionally communicative and original musicians of his age. The plainsong Propers relate the music to the Feast of the Assumption.Excellent..............."
1,Unwatchable,"I love Wonder Woman. I gave the first season a four star rating. But this third season? I can't even finish watching all the discs. There are two major problems with this. The first is that virtually all of the comic book elements that make Wonder Woman interesting (which were embraced in season one) have been ditched. The second is that this is just bad TV. Plodding direction, weak and/or ham-fisted acting, dull scripting. A fine example on how not to make a live-action Wonder Woman."
4,Love Wonder Woman,"I love the blast from the past, I loved watching this as a kid, and now I can watch whenever I want"
1,"THE COMPLETE, EDITED THIRD SEASON","Let the buyer beware! Warner has seen fit to bring WONDER WOMAN's third and final season to dvd ""complete"" with edited episodes! Thanks, guys!http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaseInfo.cfm?ReleaseID=4725"
4,Wonder Woman Hasn't Changed,I am really pleased that I have purchased all three sets. Compared to the other two DVD this is as a good as the others. This would be a good series for whole familys to watch and talk about what Wonder Woman represented when it was on air. Doing what is rirht and every one has a place in society. This should be one of the DVD that parents with young children should have in their home.
5,It is worth the money.,"If you like old television programs, or Me tv and Antenna tv, or you are just a an avid fan of Wonder Woman, this product is worth your money. I really enjoy owning this product. I remember waiting for every Friday night waiting for Wonder Woman to air on CBS. This took me back in a great way. I recommend the entire series."
4,It makes you think of other culture's ideas on child death,"I found this one to be very interesting. We tend to stay within our culture's views, and Miller enlightens our thinking. Some of it is a little strange compared to our culture's thinking. All the same, very interesting. I did not, however, read any of Miller's other books for the simple reason she has never had children. Her views are from a ""textbook"" point of view, very professional and well written. She speaks from the point of her patients, and people she has met throughout the world who have lost children. Textbook theories or not, a person cannot grasp how this truly feels unless they have had a child of their own die."
5,pure and expansive,"as beautiful as anything dolphy ever did, and booker little, one of the great lost geniuses of jazz, only intensifies the experience."
5,BEAUTIFUL ALBUM,"I HEARD THIS ALBUM MANY YEARS AGO AND WAS TAKEN BACK,HE IS A GREAT MUSICIAN AND GREAT VOCALIST,I FINALLY GOT THIS ON CD ABOUT 7 YEARS AGE I LOVE THE ALBUM,ESPECIALLY STARLIGHT AND YOU,ITS BEAUTIFUL!"
4,"OK as a card holder, great as a handy (and inexpensive) iPhone stand!","Length:: 0:37 MinsThis is OK as a business card holder. The open sides make it easy for someone removing one card to send the rest spilling out the sides. Also, it tends to slide around on hard surfaces. I still works, like I said, OK, However, what it is really good at is being an inexpensive iPhone stand. It also works to hold a tablet such as an iPad or in my case a Samsung Galaxy Tab (10.1-Inch, 16GB, Wi-Fi) in landscape orientation quite nicely. (Portrait orientation works OK but I wouldn't call it rock solid.)I still prefer myiCarpus Stand for iPhone, iPod, and More - Mount - Retail Packaging - Graphitefor travel. However, having this sitting on my desk with its ""drop in and use"" convenience, coupled with the very low cost, makes this stand a very attractive alternative."
4,Card holder,"I like this item, I ordered two because it was priced just right. I am using it to display my Avon business cards at several location, I will recommend this product."
5,Use these as a holder for my smartphone,I use these as a holder for my smartphone (Motorolla Droid Razr Maxx HD) in places like the kitchen counter to watch videos while washing dishes and on the bedside table at night. Works great for this purpose. Would buy again.
4,"Not Rolodex brand - Sent ""no name"" Eldon brand","I had purchased a couple of these as gifts and was expecting that at least the product packaging would carry the rolodex name. Instead it says ""eldon"" which may be an offshoot of the rolodex brand, but is not a rolodex. I could probably get the same thing at the local Walmart for half the price. Other than that grip, they seem well-made and suited for the purpose of holding business cards or smartphones."
3,Mine Looks Different,"I uploaded a photo of the one I received today. It's a black mesh card holder, however it's a slightly different style. Much more square and plain than the one Amazon has pictured. I wish I would have gotten the same style. Not worth my time to return or anything. It's ok. But bummed enough to deduct a couple stars.I see that other reviewers got the one as pictured... so your mileage may vary depending on who the seller is. Mine came from Best Source Office Supplies for five bucks even, free shipping."
5,Must buy!,"I've paid more for ""cheaper"" business card holders. It is a simple yet solid enough design and looks great! Recommend these if you're in the market."
3,Rolodex Black Mesh Business Card Holder (22251),This is a half-way decent mesh business card holder. The one I received is slightly uneven and wobbles slightly if you push on it. Otherwise it's fine. I can't give it more than 3 stars because of that though.
3,simple and nice,does the job...simple as that. It also looks nice on my desk. the fact that the sides are open kinda is bad because my cards can fall down if i pick up the whole thing
4,Not bad kind of expensive,This item isn't bad. Its really hard to mess up something like this. I do think it's a little expensive for what it is though
4,Nice and Durable,Seems like a good weight. Holds business cards at a good angle for display. The design looks a lot nicer than the plastic versions.
3,It holds business cards,"Nothing mind-blowing here. It's a metal mesh stand for your business cards. Or in my case, I place an old iPhone on it and use it on my night stand as an alarm clock."
3,Great mosquito repellent,"The product works better than a citronella candle. The only issue I have is that there were limited refills. For the price, it should have contained more refills."
1,An hour at most,"The blue pad releases visible smoke for perhaps an hour, that's it. The mosquitoes are gone during that time, but they back come in full force."
2,Dissapointed in FL,"After having this lit for 30 minutes for the first time, I ventured outside. Within minutes I was being bitten while about 3 feet away from the lantern. Tried again while my daugher used her baby pool but there were swarms around her even though the lantern was 5-6 feet away on the table. No wind, no reason for it to not be working. Disappointed, wish I hadn't bought extra of the strips but had desperately hoped for some relief from the mosquitos! Not sure why this works for some, sure didn't do a thing for me."
5,Little House Cookbook Review,What a wonderful book! My sister bought this for me for Christmas. I read it cover-to-cover without putting it down and stayed up until 4:00 AM! Such a history lesson! I am certain that any LIW fan will LOVE this book. I look forward to the day when my daughter is old enough to appreciate and help create some of the dishes described in this book!
4,Great History,"Some of the recipes are not really practical today, but as a historical look back at life on the prairie, it's fantastic."
5,Added recipes,"Enjoyed reading this before I gave it to my granddaughter. I added recipe cards in appropriate places from recipes I had made when her daddy was little and we lived in a log cabin in the big woods of northern Wisconsin and ""lived off the land"". So far she has only mentioned the crock pickles. Hope this makes good memories for her."
5,Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House Cookbook,I purchased this cookbook for a Christmas present. Before mailing I had a chance to thumb through it and what I saw I really liked. I plan on purchasing one for myself.
3,Little House Cookbook,"For my purposes of using a cookbook, this was interesting but not something I would turn to for today's type of living. If you want the historical value, this is a great book. As a true cookbook, things have changed and you would need to improvise to use this."
4,If you love the little house books...,"and food, you will love this book. Even if you never make any of the recipes in this book it is a joy to read Wilder's passages in this book and then read the cookbook author tell you about these old fashion foods."
4,Fun to read--good for LHOTP collections,"Even if you never cook any of these foods, this is fun reading for Little House fans. The book is crafted so excerpts from the books which mention the foods are included with the recipes. I haven't tried cooking any of these, but most recipes seem doable. Good for LHOTP collections."
5,If you love Little House you'll love this,"This is a great compliment to reading the Little House books. As a homeschool mom I know that the kids want to experience the same things that Laura and her family did and this si a really fun way of bringing the books to life! You'll learn how to make crackling corn bread, Ma's baked beans and a green pumpkin pie! This is another wonderful addition to our family library and yours as well!"
1,Poor Research,"So the Brooklyn Dogers were named because the denizens of Brooklyn were dodging the electricity in the trolley tracks and not the trolleys themselves; The American Expeditionary Force in WWI was named that because the citizens of the US couldn't get their heads around the fact that the country was going to war; and the V1 buzz bomb of WWII was radio guided. These are just three of the ""factoids"" that we learn from Tesla: Master of Lightning, when the authors aren't fawning over their hero and giving him credit for every advancement in science since 1880.The book is poorly written and researched."
5,Childhood Favorite,"I had this book as a child 30 years ago and loved it. From age five to age ten, it was one of my most requested bedtime books. My mother never understood why, as the illustrations were not vibrant as with other children's books, but the stories and far-away setting just entranced me. I still have my copy and will read it to my own daughter when she is old enough for stories. Highly recommend."
5,Underheard String Quartets,"I am very happy to have taken a chance and picked this up. Malipiero's string quartets are tonal and full of drama, yet avoid saccharine melodies or redundancy. In listening to these 8 works I was reminded a little of Bartok's first two quartets (before the full-on angular innovations), as well as the Debussy/Ravel quartets (Malipiero apparently spent a bit of time in Paris). While it would be debatable to suggest these works are in the same league as those, listeners who enjoy this medium with occasional dissonant spice will warm to these.I don't have any other performances to compare to, but the Orpheus String Quartet sound committed and the sonics are clear and well-balanced. It's a bummer these seem to go in and out of print because they deserve a wider audience.Brilliant Classics reissued the ASV set, and will hopefully keep it available awhile.Malipiero: Complete String Quartets"
5,One of the top male Jazz vocalists alive today. Period.,"Brillant, playful, smart and swinging. Highly recommended.After this one, you'll want to discover his other recordings andto see him live, again and again."
2,Useless,"My goal when I purchased this book was to learn the fundametal techniques and algorithms of data mining, such as C4.5/C5.0 and other popular algorithms, after reading the book my goal is far from being reached, on the one hand the book is not will structured, it covers many topics but with a very weak logical connection among them, on the other hand there's no complete and simple example that take the reader from A to Z illustrating step by step the basic concepts of reducing entropy, rules productions and pruning etc..., finally there's no design explanation of the downloadable code that can give a global view of the ""software"" architecture and it's building blocks, leaving the reader confused and wishing he saved he's money!."
4,explains what you will read elsewhere,"This is a nice book which explains in easy-to-understand English some of the concepts that you might read elsewhere in papers, etc. I can't comment on the usefulness of this book in a non-research or ""totally business"" type of environment, but for the industry/academic hybrid researcher, this book is recommended. I wish I could add it to my amazon Data Mining list, but lists can't be edited at this time."
3,"Try to cover many, but not depth enough.","This book is actual a textbook for a data analysis course. We use it because the flow of the chapters is almost the same as the flow of the course material. Unfortunately, it is not as useful as expected if you are in the field. It is not in depth for the materials that the authors wanted to cover due to the fact that this is not a book for just programming or just statistics. If you have a strong background on machine language or a strong background on data analysis, you may not find it useful for you career. This book is for those who have limited knowledge on both programming and statistics, but not for professionals."
5,a must have,I have worn out my original and am hoping there is one secreted away that has never been played or a re-issue on cd. Very moving album because the soldiers join in the singing. Don't pass this one bye....it is a real treasure.
3,Disappointing quality,1940s-1950s radio transcriptions of mixed sonic quality and no liner notes. Recommended only for completists.
3,Wall decorations,The decorations are small. I wasn't expecting that. Measurements need to be in the description.
1,A sad decline,"This foolish and confused book demonstrates Ms. Himmlefarb's sad decline from distinguished historian to irrelevant crank. Ignoring a mountain of emperical data, the author simply divides all social phenomena into two classes: things Gertrude Himmlefarb likes, and things she doesn't. Any thing in the latter class is cited as proof of society's inevitable decline. It's hard to recall a book so breathtakingly solopsistic since ""The Greening of America."""
3,Strangely disappointing,"Although I love Keith Laumer's lighter work, especially his stories of interplanetary diplomat Jaime Retief, I found this collection of his more serious sf unsatisfying. It's not that the writing isn't good or the concepts uninteresting, and the capstone story, ""Night of Delusions,"" features a tough PI-narrator with a sardonically amusing voice. But several of the images were disturbing to me, and I couldn't seem to get really involved in the characters' problems. If you don't care for Retief, you might well profit from having a look at this other side of the author; but if it's Laumer's lightness that has always floated your boat, it's not the book for you."
5,5x7 picture frame perfect,I ordered these picture frames for my sisters for Christmas. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I was very pleased with the service. The frames are beautiful! Thanks!
3,"Excelente libro, traduccion.... no muy buena","Este libro me encanto!!! Es mucho mas facil que leer que la version en ingles. Me moleso mucho, que no tuviera notas al calce *footnotes* del libro para ayudar en la lectura, ya que en esta novela se hace referencia a eventos o personajes de la epoca victoriana. Si tienes la oportunidad de leer la historia en ingles y de la editorial Dalmatian Press mucho mejor!"
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"I bought this book based on a recommendation in an Amazon list of children's books.Big mistake. Amazon should check those lists for that kind of mistake.This book series is probably quite good for adults but it's absolutely not for children. I'm quite liberal but there is kinky sex, violence and foul language in these books that I think kids don't need to be exposed until they are well into their teens."
5,A classic album... from the soul of a pure genius,"Larry Heard is a genius. Genesis is another testament to that fact. The sound is deep, vast, and soulful. I could not find a poor track in the lot."
2,Lavinge needs to give it up already!!!,Tony Tate was a rat from the start. Nothing but a flunky wanna-be cop. Lavinge holds HAMC in contempt and goes through great pains to show them as rats. He then holds Tate up as some sort of martyr for doing the same thing he condemns HAMC for...making brotherhood secondary. Tate comes across as a wanna-be tough guy who's actually running scared.
1,"Trash, Trash, Trash","This book is not worth reading unlesss someone is paying you to read it, and paying you very well. Even if you find this book lying on the street do not wast your time.Well the story a Neurotic with illusions of granduer who wants to be James Bond inflitrates the Hell's Angels and then a hack writer who does not knew how to tell a coherent story attempts to make him a hero."
2,Yves Lavigne: Into the Trash,"If you like reading about a rat, and Anthony Tate stroking his ego for 400 pages of text, you mite like this book."
1,don't buy it.,"I feel a bit tainted, a bit dirtied that I bought this book. I should have been tipped off by the authors statement that he's the ""foremost authority on the HA in North America"". Clearly that's BS as any HA member would be more of an authority. It's like a dog claiming to be an expert on kitty litter. Then there's Tait. I found nothing respectable about him. The thing is, everyone can smell BS when you're standing in it, and this book reaks of it. Maybe I'll send to some $$ to the HA legal defense fund to make myself feel a little less soiled by this sad attempt at exploitation."
4,"An intriguing true, but slanted account of the Hells Angels MC","First of all there are a lot of Bikers who are pissed off at this book. Anyone who gives this book less than three stars is very biased and shouldnt be taken seriously. This book is exciting. It does jump around a little, but it is far from being hard to follow. This book is also biased to a certain extent. Yes, the author believes that the Hells Angels are criminal organization during the duration of the book if not to present day. The author presents a very compelling case for this. The story is centered around Anythony Tait the FBI informant on the Angels during Operation CACUS. If you aren't interested in someone who goes into organized crime and helps the government take them down, dont read this book. If you want to read a book about the Hells Angels Drug dealers and upper leadership being taken down from within by an FBI informant this is the book for you."
1,Worse than dragging your tongue through broken glass...,"I'm not sure what was worse, the page after page after page after (you get the picture) of legalese or the one-sided view of the outlaw biker. The author had some pretty stout words when they're printed on paper and not spoken to Ralph Barger. This book is only about someone who didn't like the path they had chosen in life and tried to do something that would make themselves feel better in retrospect. Read this book ONLY after you've grown tired of smacking yourself in the head with your shoe."
2,hard to read,"not a bad story just hard to follow, the book kinda jumps arouund and the language is pretty hard to follow i dont know if he was going for what was said verbatem or just poor editing"
5,Attention Getting however interesting.,The book is very interesting and held my attention. It was true to life as far as the red tape that our government has plased on Law Enforcement. The book was just a JOY to read.
3,Biker Gang From A Snitch Perspective,"There is some good content and a few interesting stories. It becomes tedius as you realize that the Author has his own agenda of anti-Angel bias. The center of the story, Tait, is without a doubt an unsavory human being. The Author attempts to validate the actions of Tait but does not suceed. All in all this is a decent read only if you find the subject itself to be intrigueing."
3,Could have been a great story but for the author,"I meet Anthony Tait in 1993 long after this case had gone overt, we were both attending a long range sniper school, the image depicted of him by Lavigne is both insulting and untrue. Tony is one of the last great American heros, this is a real man who has been there and done that. As he once told me the Angels are pretty lame when stacked up against some of the other criminal organizations he has worked. As a SWAT cop, I'll go down that dark hallway with him anytime or anywhere. This guy kicks a$$!!!!!!!!"
2,Some parts interesting,"This book was OK. There were a lot of parts that i just scanned when Lavigne was talking about the interworkings of the Federal and State Law Enforcement because i simpley dont care. Tait is a top notch scumbag as well. He didnt do any of it for the greater good, just to make a name, and his desire to go into law enforcement. If he wasnt an informant, he would have been no different than any of them, maybe worse. The one thing i did like was the taped church meetings. For the first time we know what they were talking about at Local, Coastal, USA, and World Meetings. The author was definately biased, and to claim he is the top Hells Angels advisor is rediculous. Also he says they started from the Boozefighers MC when they actually stared from the Pissed of Bastards MC. Isnt as good as other books out there. Read Williams Queens book 'Under and Alone'."
1,Worst textbook ever,"This is by far the MOST CONFUSING textbook I have ever had. Note the fact I said ""had"" and not ""used"" because I cant even use this book because it is so confusing, and I don't know a single person taking the stat course that even refers to this book. Even my instructor agrees it is a very confusing book and does not even use it himself. The writer throws in all these relations and far too many greek symbols in my opinion, he needs to get down to the point and just give the concepts and the formula's. The stat book I used before was MUCH EASIER to understand than this one. Makes a great paperweight however."
5,Top Band.,"Lobby Loyde and the Coloured Balls was I feel one of the most original bands for their time in Australia the music was slitely jazzy with that rock and blues feel. If they were in America or England I feel they would have gone a lot further. This is one of their classic albums two cds one is rock and roll but the other is very different. I really like it, worth the money a good cd to have in the collection."
5,Another great Yourdon book,"Once again Yourdon publishes a timely thoughtful look at the issues facing software engineers. He covers the topic of outsourcing, as he did in Rise and Fall, but this time in a much more succinct and directed manner. This is a much shorter book, but the text is more focused and he makes his points effectively with minimal use of illustrations.You may not like his conclusions, but he provides a complete and pragmatic analysis of outsourcing. There is advice for both individuals and companies in how to compete effectively in the global marketplace.If software engineering is your career and your passion then you need to read this book."
3,Small,It is smaller then I thought it would be but I guess it will work. The picture made it looked big then it is.
5,Vinyl Siding vs. Historic Preservation,"This is probably a must read for members of local Historic Preservation Commissions as they often review proposals for plastic siding that is applied to historic homes. Too often vinyl siding is placed on a home for a quick sale rather than the owner repairing the damage caused by lack of paint or leaking pipes. It is called replacement siding because you or someone else will replace it at the end of its life in 10-12 years.The film does an excellent job in portraying the true cost to the environment and people associated with its manufacture and installation. Its a precise, humorous but harrowing true tale."
5,DVD - Blue Vinyl,"A timely transaction with the product carefully packaged, etc. I would not hesitate to shop with this merchant again."
3,Review of Blue Vinyl DVD,"This is a tongue in cheek environmental commentary on vinyl siding on homes and the environmental consequences. It has a much lighter touch than most environmental documentaries on products with toxic consequences, making it more accessible to the general public. The production values for this DVD leave something to be desired which caused me to lower its rating. Vinyl siding is cheaper and longer lasting than its natural counterparts, so that the film's protagonist faced challenges in finding ""green"" alternatives to the vinyl siding on her parent's home. Given the current economic meltdown, it is a challenge for families to be both ""green"" and frugal at the same time. Homeowners with asbestos siding (which is worse environmentally than vinyl siding) face challenges in selling their properties without incurring significant hazardous waste cleanup costs."
3,"Power is fleeting, hip-rock isn't","Its funny how so much of this is the opposite of true rise-up music in retrospect. Rage was a great group, and EE is as consistent an album they made, but (as with all their work) besides for a few key songs where the concentrated elements fully come together, verse/chorus simply drift by on autopilot, dressed-up with de la Rocha's pre-packaged temperament of sometimes sterile emceeing, though driven, of course, with Morello's ambitiously distorted manifestos and anchored by the rest."
4,A great cd,"rage was one of the greatest bands of the 90's, and this cd is one of their best. It has songs that are very heavy (tire me, bulls on parade) and alot of more rap-oriented songs (basically every track besides tire me and bulls on parade). The only thing that seperates Rage from the other ""rap-rock"" bands out there is their unique ability to go from a hip-hop funky rap verse straight into a clashing guitar riff. They do that better than anyone else. I definitely recommend this album to music lovers."
5,Not Your Typical Hard Rock,"Hard rock is not one of my favorite genres. For me, it often sounds contrived, formulaic, and downright uninteresting. I am much more of an alt-rock fan. I only like a selective few hard rock artists, including Tool, Deftones' newer stuff, and Rage Against The Machine's older stuff. Evil Empire, Rage's sophomore album, is the band at its best. Marshall Mathers was not the first angry white rapper, Zach de la Rocha was. His masterful lyrical style perfectly compliments Tom Morello's one-of-a-kind crunching guitar riffs. This is a high energy album that never stops from start to finish. I'm stingy with the five stars. This one deserves it. It eclipses all other RATM albums and still stands as my Favorite Rock Album of the '90s."
4,Good,"starts out strong with ""people of the sun"" and the hit ""bulls on parade"" both very good espicially in lyrics. The album looses some steam halfway through though, but its still good."
5,"Ratm Is the best band, this album is rockin!!","Ratm has great albums but this is there best. Evil Empire has some great songs on it, the best is Bulls On Parade. Revolver is cool to. What am I sayin I like them all."
5,SIMPLY THA BEST,"This CD is THE BEST. From end to end the heart stopping pumps of the well-miked bass drum, Tom's artistic guitar skills, and who can forget, Zack's Talent for writing uniqely original Lyrics! RATM is an empire, an EVIL EMPIRE! **$%"
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS DEBUT","This is RATM's 2nd album, and it's also their 2nd best. Each album has gotten worse, but they are all good c.d.'s. On this one, the best songs are ""People Of The Sun"", ""Bulls On Parade"", & ""Snakecharmer"". Really, the only thing that messes up the album are ""Without A Face"" & ""Wind Below"", all the rest of the songs are pretty good. So, go pick up this and/or their s/t album, both of them are pretty cool."
4,La Guerra Politica,Oh Yeah. This is for the people of the SUN! I can't begin to tell you what a joy this album is. From People of the Sun to Bulls on Parade to Down Rodeo Rage weaves a tapistry of anger and pride. Two deadly sins I might add. This is good because the album is sinful like the strawberry covered cheesecake that you crave but know will skyrocket your cholesterol. Great guitars by Morello and Wilk. And awsome vocals by De La Rocha. Battle is a good follow up but lacks the gritting teeth of Empire.
5,Its A Bomb Album From The Best Band Out There Peroid.......,"Im a Big RATM Fan I Been Lising To Them For a While Now 4 Years To Be Excact.My Comment's On Evil Empire Are That This Freking Cd With 11 Song's In The Best Album Money Can Buy.I Love How Zack Sing's About EZLN On ""People Of The Sun""Or How Tom Play's The Gitar On ""Bull's On Parade""This Cd Is One Of The Best Of The 90's I Love It And Let's All Rage Against The Machine"
5,Excellent! One of the best c.d.'s ever!,"I don't like rap, but for Rage i'll make an exception. I know they aren't considered rap, but Zack de la Rocha raps out the lyrics. Mixing rock and rap together sounds great and that's what Rage does. This is one of the greatest albums of all time! The beats are grooving and lyrics are true and great. Get this c.d. if you like rock and/or rap music!"
5,Amzing as usual,"AMAZING!!!!!!If you are a die hard Rage Against The Machine fanand if you dont already have this (somehow??)GET IT NOWIf u have never heard of Rage Against The Machine but have been recomended this album ,buy this one and buy the first one and listen to the first one first.The difrence between this album and the other Rage albums is that this one is more of a rap/hip hop album.but its still AMAZINGmy fave track is Snakecharmer"
2,Dissapointing follow - up to a phenomenal debut,"Well rage is back...ohhh I wish this album could have been like their first one. This album definitely gets the award for most sounds coming out of a gutair that you would'nt think could come out of a guitar...but are the sounds that good? Sometimes yes, but most times no. The oly track I can truly recommend is ""bulls on parade"", which you can get on a single anyway. This is not a terrible album, but you would expect more from a band with such an amazing debut album and such talented artists"
2,Rage's worst album,"_Evil Empire_ is easily Rage Against the Machine's worst album. (I haven't checked out anything after _The Battle of Los Angeles_, though.) Although the CD has a few good songs, it is not that far removed from being a piece of garbage. This album fails to build upon Rage's 1992 self-titled debut. _Rage Against the Machine_ had energy and good musicianship; _Evil Empire_ is mired by sloppiness and repetition. This album is not total [drivel], but you'd be much better off checking out _Rage Against the Machine_ and _The Battle of Los Angeles_. Tom Morello's unique style of guitar playing really doesn't shine the way it did on this band's debut. Pass on buying this recording."
5,Absoultely amazing,"RATM has really outdone itself this time. Forget limp bizkit, korn etc, this is the real deal. Truely good music w/ a meaning. If you don't buy it you are really missing out on a masterpiece."
3,A little dissapointing.,"Rage's self entitled album amazed me so much that it convinced me to buy their second album. And I must say, it was a little dissapointing coming from the musicians who gave us such classic jams as ""Killing in the Name"", ""Bombtrack"", ""Take the Power Back"", ""Wake Up"", and basically the whole first album. While its got some great jams like ""People of tha Sun"", ""Bull's On Parade"", and ""The Year of Tha Boomerang"", I felt it lacked the creative genius of the first album. It didn't have the funk eliment to it and Rage seemed to focus a little more on Noise than Music. But it's still a good album none the less. I would have expected more from Rage though."
1,Where can I buy the instrumental version?,"Some bands are sooo close to being great, but one element just blows their chance. Think of Smashing Pumpkins without Billy Corgan's nasal whine. Then there is Rage Against the Machine. This CD has all the muscular riffs and beats that you could ever want to find in one place. 'Bulls' is incredible sounding and then...Zach begins singing. It's not just his lack of any kind of vocal ability, its also his feverish lyrics that have all of the political sophistication of your average community college freshman. Hey Zach, throw in a ""tired of working for the man"" everyonce in a while, and you will have moved up to your sophomore year. Meanwhile, a tight rhythm section and some hot guitar go to waste. Maybe Empire will be re-released as an all instrumental some day. One can only hope."
2,Ragm is such a great band.... on paper,"What a bright and original idea for a rock n' roll band. combine the militant rantings of Chuck D. (of P.E. fame) and a doomsday prophet. Mix in the wild funk metal of faith no more and the skeletal Post hardcore guitar stylings of Fugazi. Then add in a bunch of smart radical lyrics and you would have a great band wouldnt you? Well Yes..... but ragm just dont dont pull it through.There songs are just a bore to listen too. Either keep it short fast and brutal or incorporate some god damn melodies. RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE just fall flat and it pains me because they have such a great sound too. Why couldnt they just make these songs Interesting?.Well If I ever want some good militant socialist music I usually head to Crass, Refused, or good ole' public enemy and if I were you i'd head there too.Peace"
1,HYPOCRITES,"So Rage Against the Machine thought fit to burn the American Flag at Woodstock. It's Bad Enough that they have Chosen for their Poster Boy a convicted MURDERER of a Police Officer who was only trying to PROVIDE a safe ENVIRONMENT for these MORONS to Spout their Venom. Truth be told, they have a few good songs. But you people, just be AWARE. They're quick to BURN the AMERICAN FLAG that your grandfathers, fathers and brothers DIED to DEFEND, BUT... YOU DON'T SEE THEM BURNING the U$S$ DOLLARS on STAGE that they're MILKING from YOU. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING from THESE BASTARDS and Hopefully the REST of YOU Will do the SAME. AND DRIVE THEM to the OBSCURITY FROM WHENCE THEY CAME"
5,this cd has taken the real world and put it to song,"This cd RULES!!! I am a true Rage fan and I still like the older one better but, this one is a fine sequel, with timeless classics people of the sun and bulls on parade. I think the band are the only people on earth that know what they are singing about, This CD is not singing, it is PREECHING"
4,"Second album, second on the list","RATM is very unique. They are one of the few bands that I am into that peaked with their debut album. Their self-titled was better than Evil Empire, Evil Empire was better than the Battle of L.A., and this album is better than Renegades. Their first album was a landmark album and was way ahead of its time. I guess when I think of the latter three albums, each sticks out in my mind for one killer song: ""Bulls on Parade"", ""Guerilla Radio"", and ""Renegades of Funk"". But with their first album, their was no clear best song. They all rock! Still worthy without a doubt though."
5,Evil Empire Rocks!,"WOW! What an album! Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, Tim.com and Zack De La Rocha have done it once again. From ""Bulls On Parade"" to ""Without A Face"", the Vocals, Guitar, Bass and Drums and hard and heavy. Never a dull moment in this album, get ready to rock with these 11 songs of rage."
4,"Not the best of Rage, but almost a Grammy? WTF! LoL","Okay, in my opinion not the best Rage CD. I do like it, how can you hate Bulls on Parade or Tire me? But some of the songs seem...drawn out and tiring. If you want a full rage expierence, check out their first CD, or maybe battle of L.A. But Still, a very well down album. I'll give it 4 stars."
5,The greatest band on the planet!,"Rage against the machine is by far, the greatest band to grace the music industry in a long time. This album, like their first, is a combination of passionate lyrics, and hard driving guitars from the most brilliant guitarist in the world, Tom Morello. Zack De LaRocha's lyrics are incredibly strong, and always in-your-face. It was hard to top the bands first self titled album, but I think Evil Empire walks away with the crown. Easily one of the best albums ever produced. Even if you are not a fan of Hip-hop hardcore music, the passion and energy that RATM displays, is enough to win any music enthusiast over. I highly reccomend Evil Empire, as well as their first album, because they are both brilliant examples of what music is supposed to sound like."
4,Alright CD,"This CD, of the first three rage album has the same problem as the 2nd books in trilogies, it doesn't do that much. Do not get me wrong, it is still a great album, just not Rage's best. Still a worthwhile buy for hardcore Rage fans."
1,Not so Good,"This cd was very disappointing, it was a waiste of $15. If you want good hardcore music check out both Limp Bizkit cds and Kid Rock's Devil without a cause."
1,This band sucks,"This is the best band of the 90's,ha!!!Admit it they were sellouts who sang about anti establishment then partied with president of treir record label in his mansion.They were corny then and crappy now, thank god they broke up on my birthday which made an excellent b-day present. Tom Morello was an overrated guitarrist who used elestronics to hode the fact that he can't play guitar.Zack de la Rocha was a horrible singer thats why he had to rap instead. The rhythmic section was a lame excuse, just lame.Skip this band, overrated,overhyped and undertalented. Hell linkin park and limp bizkit made way better bands."
1,MOLOTOV wipes the floor with r.a.t.m,"MOLOTOV is the only Real Rap/Metal Band out there that really matters,they are from Mexico but belive me they are a million times better and more raw than that electronica based mainstream ""Rage against the machine"".Want proof? listen to their album ""Donde jugaran las ninas"" and judge for yourself."
1,Bulls##t,"Phony one-percenters selling ""revolution"" to the children of yuppies. Can any band be more hypocritical, or irrelevant? In a word, this is garbage."
3,"Good Cd, Great Message","I love ""Bulls on Parade"", but not that crazy about the rest of the album. RATM is a wild, loud, politcal group, but their message is perfect for todays politically numb voting population. I recommend ""The Battle for LA"", their newer CD."
2,Tedious,"First off i have to say that Zack de la Rocha is one of the greatest rappers ever. His lyrics are thoughtful and his delivery is unique and passionate. This album however is a tedious and stale affair. Rage's debut is arguably the greatest Rap/Rock album ever and probably always will be. Everything seemed to gel together on the debut. It was fresh and exciting and it rocked hard. On Evil Empire they have become more of a straight ahead rap band without the rock. The band doesn't get to flesh out its sound like they did on the debut. They seem to have been demoted to just background noise for Zack's political rants. The songs are very repetive and predictable and the vocals start to gripe really bad. Tom morello makes all sorts of bizarre sound effects with his guitar but thier are no great hooks. Thier is little rage or intensity on Evil Empire, it's all very calculated and contrived. Thier next album would unfortunately follow the same trend."
3,Less than Impressive,"I gave it three stars because of the songs ""Bulls on Parade,"" ""Revolver,"" and ""Down Rodeo,"" which are really good, but other than those three there's not much on here worth buying. I found ""People of the Sun"" and ""Year of tha Boomberang"" to be really annoying, and the rest were ok, but there was nothing that really grabbed my interest. Just go with their first album, it's much better."
4,WAKE UP,"This CD is the perfect way to start my morning - I load it into the CD player in my car, turn it WAY up and drive to work. Its the best cup of coffee!! By the time I get to work, I'm awake and ready to ROCK!!"
4,The Cure for Insomnia is to Scratch the Itch,"Rage's second album Evil Empire is not like their first. They definitely tried some different things here. I get this feeling they were thinking 'scratch the itch' 'scratch the itch'. More of the same can be very tedious and tiring. They wanted to brach out and prove they can do multiple things. The political lyrics are still there but the sound is quite different. Still good nonetheless.My favorites are: Bulls On Parade, Vietnow, Snakecharmer, Tire Me, and Without a FaceRecomended.Also check out:Rage Against the MachineThe Battle of Los AngelesRenegades"
3,OOPS,"When I said that SOAD was better, I meant their lyrics, not their music. Serj's lyrics are more complex, that's what I meant.MY BAD! I should have been more specific, sorry people."
5,This CD is what makes Freedom Speech blare out!,"Rage Against The Machine is definetely a political band (that is taken seriously through out the CD) Zach De La Rocka the vocalist has strong opinions on matters that matter. Unlike those stupid bands such as Limp Bizkit and Korn, Rage have lyrics that have to do with actual happenings in the news and on television. This CD is even better than the first!"
4,SNAP THE NECK WITH A RAPPING CHAINSAW,"Rage Against the Machine bombard the listener with a rough and tumble tribute to hardcore punk and politically endowed rap.they bash out grinding bass rythyms pasted into metallic groove metal onslaughts with fat,pounding hip hop beats that try their best to breack open a metal can of budweiser while watching public enemy breack dance.angry in a political sence which actually make the hard rythymic rap chainsaw work. on Evil Empire Rage Against The Machine snap your neck like no other band of their ilk since body count.Review by Asher Locketz."
5,Another Rawkin' CD by RATM,"Evil Empire, although not as good as their first album is yet another angry and inventive album. Zach doesn't sound as mad as their self-titled album, but he delivers the energy once again with high voltage political anger. The first three songs leave you breathless, and the rest is very good too."
5,This is a great CD,"This CD, Rage's follow up to the hit debut self titled album, contains eleven songs, all of which I like. From ""People of the Sun"" to ""Year of the Boomerang"" all the songs pack a punch to get anyone excited. The amazing sounds made only by guitaristTom Morello combined with powerful vocals of Zack de La Rocha create a unique blend of Hard Rock and Rap. This album delivers a blow that knocks everyone else down. I recommend this CD to anyone who can appreciate an original genre of music."
2,Always seems to be the same song playing,"When I listen to this cd, it seems to me that I am listening to the same song all the time. There ain't no subtilities in this music.We can't say that the signer sings, I would say that he cry out loud.This music is dedicated to those who are frustrated and I am not.If you like rock mixed with rap, you will love it but I didn't."
5,zack rules!,i am glad zack burned the american flag for i am american indian. he did the right thing at woodstock this year! after what the whiteman did to us years ago! forcing us out of reservations! the goverment sucks!
4,enRAGEed Rocha hits the mic again,"""Evil Empire"" is a album that not only avoids the sophmore jinx that curses most bands, but is actually (in some ways) an improvement over their supercharged debut. In EE we can see how Rage has evolved, with more complex sounds and melodies, with great guitar tricks by Morello, as well as some intense and perhaps more directed lyrics. The album is stylistically superior to the debut, and manages to retain the raw lyrical power that drew fans to begin with. Their more progressive hooks, a little more obvious than the debut, really shine through on ""Bulls on Parade"" and ""Down Rodeo"". Lyrical power shows through on songs such as ""People of the Sun"" and ""Year of the Boomarang"", even if you thought the debut was a little rambling and ragged, check out ""Evil Empire"" it is worth the listen."
1,RAGE BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,RAGE IS THE WORST BAND OF ALL TIME!! ANYBODY WHO OWNS THEIR CD SHOULD DIE!!!!!!!!
1,This sucks!,I can't believe the reviewers gave this high scores because it's one of the worst cds I have ever bought. The guitar is anything but grinding and the sound is so unclear that it sounds like it came from a garage. A very horrible cd
2,Ehhhh...,"I dunno, this album has phat beats and i like the lyrics and the messages it sends, but most of the songs sound the same. But I still like the band. ""Bulls on Parade"" would have to be my fave track."
4,"I love it, but not as much as the original","This album is great but it lacks the raw power of the first album. I love the song Down Rodeo, it is the closest thing to the power of the first CD."
3,chamomile and Lemon Organic deodorant,"This deodorant was not strong enough for me. I use itafter I use my lady speed stick or Arrid extra dry.It just did not keep order away all day, even just in the houseactivities. Nice smell, but not good deodorant."
3,Fashion Fever Room Kit,"The room kit was cheaply made but is fine for $5. It would not be worth the full retail price. Floor ""tiles"" are just stickers. Walls are cardboard inserts. The Fashion Fever bed takes up practically the whole floor area. It would be better if it had a larger floor area and was covered more like a room box."
4,Great place to get started,"""Programming Microsoft InfoPath"" is a great place to start.The book covers how to get started and how InfoPath fits into the software developer's toolbox, from Form design thru security, and integration with SharePoint/BizTalk.With this book and a little practice, I was able to start creating practical ""Smart Client"" applications on the first day.Pat Tormey PEFoursquare Solutions"
5,Covers the latest features and options of InfoPath,"Thom Robbins' PROGRAMMING MICROSOFT INFOPATH: A DEVELOPER'S GUIDE appears in its updated second edition to cover the latest InfoPath solutions in the MS Office system. It updates the former book to cover all new features and options as they work with Service Pack 1, provides updated examples and insights, and will reach practicing developers with the latest forms and options which can be customized to meet user needs."
1,Infopath for Developers,"This book really doesn't teach you much of anything - it tells you about things, it describes concepts - but there is very little step-by-step information. If you are looking for tutorial type materials, this isn't it. If you are looking for books to supplement tutorial type materials, this is very likely your book."
3,"Not bad, but a little flimsy","I was hoping it would be a little sturdier (thicker). For this price, it's not too bad. If you're using it in a setting where it won't be abused, it's great. For field biologists like myself, it will at least work until it gets bent. Then again, wooden meter sticks break, so there isn't really a perfect product out there yet."
2,A flimsy metal meterstick,"This meterstick is printed on one side 0 through 36"" and 0 through 100 cm. The other side is blank. It has a hole at the 1"" mark that is around 3/8"" in diameter so that you can hang it up. Everything about this meterstick is ok in my opinion except the metal is not thick enough and it is flimsy. I rate it a 2. If the meterstick were as think as most metal yardsticks I would have rated it a 5."
3,Nice Stick,"The two meter sticks I ordered look good for the science classes where I plan to use them.They are a bit thin, but if I threaten the students enough, they should last a good time. (This is an edited review, but I can't see how to upgrade from 3 stars to 4)"
5,An excellet introduction,"This book offers an excellent presentation of the category of myth--what myths are, why they exist, what they provide, how they function in society as well as in individuals. It is both clear and concise; in no sense is it necessary to be familiar with the field in order to understand it.Please be advised that the book is not an anthology of myths. It provides an introduction to myth that would be helpful in a course on mythology, but a collection of myths would also be necessary."
1,boring,"A lot of this work could be told in far fewer words. Much of what the author says is stuff I knew already and nothing she said added anything new. It may well be a good book for someone just starting to study sociology and myth, however."
3,Short and breazy,"Brief overview of better known myths, and they are covered in the theme that myths along with rationality played complementary roles in human history/prehistory. No mention of myths from outside of Eurasia.In the last chapter, the author argues her thesis on the modern equivalent of ""myths"" by cataloguing novels and paintings. Didn't care for such debate for eggheads and literary crowds, but I guess they are the target audience.Overall, a breazy read, but too brief even for ADD person like me."
3,A Short History of Myth,"This is a book written by an ex-nun. I'm not surprised that she is an ex-nun. There is something very anti-religious in what she's written. She attempts in the book to explain the logical reason for the deepest beliefs of the major religions, especially Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. I found that her understanding of the ""myths"" of Judaism are more fiction than the ""myths"" themselves. Her conclusion seems to call for a ""new"" set of religious ""myths"" to replace what the people have always believed because science has proven those ""myths"" to be false. On the other hand, she agrees with what I have said: human beings can not correctly function without a supernatural belief to replace what science takes away."
2,Probably Armstrong's worst book.,"I am a long-time fan of Karen Armstrong's writings. ""A History of God"" changed my life. ""The Case for God"" is brilliant. ""The Great Transformation"" is filled to overflowing with information and ideas. Even her books about the Buddha and the Bible are worth reading. But ""A Short History of Myth"" is boring, badly written, light on content, and generally uninteresting.I will admit that Armstrong has some good ideas and is able to draw an emotional response out of the reader. Occasionally her words make me feel a drive to connect with the ""Something"" that religion and myth are all about. It feels like Armstrong teases you with enlightenment and pulls it away like a bullfighter's red cape. Not to mention the fact that this book is boring. I have tried to read this book no less than three times but never got more than halfway because it is so incrediby boring."
3,"Good Material, Good Presentation, But...","Good material, good presentation, good production, but the ratings on this CD will probably depend on where and how you listen to the CD. Not recommended for drive-time listening..too many distractions on the road...But, to listen in a room, in a stationary situation where you can concentrate on content, probably pretty good....One note, however...some of the names, places and concepts are easier to keep up and mentally catalog with the printed word rather than the spoken word.Content-4...Disc Presentation 4....all depends on your ability to concentrate while listening to disk."
4,Importance of myth for human flourishing,"Karen Armstrong addresses an issue very much a concern with regard to the separation of faith and science. There is the impression that all myths are fictional, false, stories while science uses empirical methods to establish facts and gather data on which effective prediction is possible. While this is essentially correct about science and explains why it has been such a boon to mankind, the importance of myth is missed entirely by comparison. Karen Armstrong examines the various species of myth and relates them in a very accessible way that focuses on their importance with regard to how they do succeed in accomplishing a mission that is just as important for human flourishing."
3,Interesting reading,"There are some factual errors in this book, but for the most part interesting reading. Check reference material when facts are stated, i.e. Pg 94, God did not command Ezekiel to eat excrement; He said to cook with it...check the Bible, Ezekiel 4:12,15.Consider her view with a critical eye. Still interesting reading."
3,Inspiring despite two serious errors,"The concept of this book is great: trace myth through history, and then point out that modern humans have nothing to replace it. However, Armstrong makes two serious errors. First, she falsely projects a linear history onto myth and philosophy, when there's nothing of the sort, as there have always been good/better/best visions of spirituality. Second, she takes a Christian dualist position and projects it onto all other faiths, resulting in some complex misinterpretations that the average reader will not catch, and thus will be misled. It seems to me she errs in her interpretation of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" as well, but that's a much smaller issue. On the whole, the concept of this book inspired me, and I love Armstrong's fluid, expressive writing, but a theologist is not a philosopher, and in that difference we see the root of the errors that doom this book to second-rate status."
5,Reminiscent of the Da Vinci Code,"The plot of the movie, with its secret societies, treasure hunts, and boy-and-girl-thrown-together-in-a-mutual-quest scenario were reminiscent of Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", only better. Nicolas Cage's funny ""sidekick"" was a good addition that added a lot of laughs and one-liners. For me, one of the bests part of the movie was the on-location filming in the rotunda and other parts of the National Archive, which I happened to have visited this summer (by the way, if you get to Washington D.C., make this your first priority to go see. It inspires lasting awe, and would you believe it's free). Like the DaVinci Code, which had a lot of readers dashing to their computers to look at ""The Last Supper"", I bet a lot of people who see this movie run straight home and Google Ben Franklin's Silence Dogood letters. If you like history, or fun movies with a happy ending, this one won't disappoint. Go see it. We loved it."
3,Natinal Treasure= 3 stars,"This movie is ok If you have Nothin to do.This is a Family movie, not a party movie.Its a little tense but not that much that youget all scared. Overall this movie is about a3 star movie nothin big. I would rent it but notbuy it unless you liked it. some parts of this movieare lame but Its worth watchin If youhave nothin to do, but Its mostly a Family Night Movie."
1,Terrible,If you are over 12 years old or even a remotely cool under 12 year old do not rent this movie. Yawn fest!
1,Boring....,Did not grab me. 30 minutes in I got up walked out the room and left it. No need to continue watching. Other members of my household liked the movie okay. Nothing to really great about it though.
1,"Historically insulting, lots of loop holes, boring ride, etc.","The the Mason's are good guys, all those funky images on your money and in D.C. are just clues to a buried treasure, the Bill of Rights is made of Animal skin?I could go on, typical Disney bull, seems they are trying there best to take you attention away from REAL history, with this bologna.Do yourself a favor and read up about the real Masons and the real US Shadow Gov."
1,Another uninspired Nicolas Cage movie,I can't remember the last half-decent movie this guy has made. I think i'll just skip anything with him in it from now on.
1,"Did not get the product, cannot review",I DID NOT GET THIS PRODUCT BUT GOT CHARGED FOR IT AND AM WAITING FOR A CREDIT. YOU NEED TO SEND ME A CREDIT AND THEN I CAN GIVE AMAZON A GOOD REVIEW FOR THE COMPANY.
5,"A clean, fun, fast-paced movie","I've seen a lot of comparison between this movie and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's true that they do both involve searches for a hidden treasure of historical significance, but in my opinion that's about where the similarity ends. (What's harder for me to understand is why it seems to gall some people so much that this movie was a big success.)Anyway, I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers or by the title of my own. I'll just say that I was skeptical about this movie but wound up really enjoying it; I rented it first, but now I'm planning to buy it.P.S. For those of you who criticized this movie for being a rip-off of Raiders of the Lost Ark, it might interest you to know that Spielberg himself admits that ""Raiders"" was a rip-off of old movie serials he used to watch and enjoy as a kid. As Homer Simpson would say, ""Doh!"""
5,This was great!,I love this movie. Such broad history and such great actors and actresses. Nicholas Cage is great in this as he portrays a true history buff as myself.
5,History lover's dream movie,There are so many tie ins to american history that any history buff should see this movie!!!
5,Good movie,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I've seen a lot of Nicholas Cage movies (8mm, The Rock, Con Air, etc) so maybe I am biased towards him.I've watched this movie 3 times and it doesn't wear thin too quick like some movies."
4,A good adventure film for the family,"National Treasure is a fast-moving, creative flick, with some good tidbits of American history thrown in. Like a lot of adventure movies of its genre, there are plenty of ""yeah, sure"" moments and lack of deep dialog; however, my wife and I appreciated the fact that the producers left out a lot of the profanity and violence that seem to make every movie look the same these days. The film kept a good pace and the love interest was present, but not cheesily overdone. Recommended for everyone."
4,I'll Keep This Brief,"When I saw this film in theaters I hated it. I thought it was dreadfully stupid. I was waiting impatiently for THE DA VINCI CODE to destroy NATIONAL TREASURE. Then, 2 years later, I saw THE DA VINCI CODE and immediately following decided that TREASURE was indeed the better movie, watched it again and enjoyed it thoroughly."
2,Goonies grown-up,"Disney has rehashed ""The Goonies"", with this derivative work.(minus Sloth)This is definitely geared to younger audiences. The almost laughable plot holes are patched over with scene changes and 5 second dialogue patches. I really only watched this because the filming in Philadelphia was directly across from where I worked. (I didn't make it into any background scenes... oh well). It's not that bad... but with a grown-up cast, I had the expectation for grown-up dialogue. (would have been nice.) It's fast paced (to the point of sacrificing plausability) Bad guys are bad for no real reason, and of course can't hit the broadside of a barn when firing their guns. I'm not going to address the plot or characters, its really not worth my time. Watch ""The Goonies"". It's got better characters, better dialogue and better treasure. (and Sloth!)"
3,I Blush with Embarassment to Say...,"... that, inspite of a few laughable historical inaccuracies, I found myself enjoying this amusement park ride. The movie is a well-paced old-school adventure, and out of all the Da Vinci Code rip-off desserts that audiences are being served, this one sits most comfortably on the stomach.Now remember, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, so there's bound to be explosions... even in the middle of a frozen arctic sea. It wasn't obnoxious like many of his other pictures, though. Nicholas Cage was solid, and the Evil Treasure Hunters that he must spar with are a forgettable motley crew, which is my chief complaint: characterization.This movie will probably die a silent death of obscurity in a few years. But as junk food goes, it's got spice."
4,Interesting tale based on American history,"As others have said, this movie does bear some similarities to the Indiana Jones films... But it is no more a rip-off of Indian Jones than it is of the Goonies. This is an interesting and entertaining film in its own right, which left me with a greater historical understanding of a very rich period of American history, and the curiosity to learn more. Overall a worthwhile watch."
3,Indiana Jones and the Founding Fathers,"By MovieTony.comFor some reason as many critics hated National Treasure as much as they loved The Polar Express. Express is a mutt disguised as a pedigree puppy, while National Treasure knows it's a mutt and goes along with it, turning tricks to become a worthwhile action film.The premise is simple: there's clues to over ten museum's worth of treasures on the back of the original handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Gage (decently underacting for once) plays the black sheep of a family of treasure hunters, and decides to steal the document before former colleague Sean Bean pilfers it and finds the treasure.National Treasure is about fifteen minutes too long, wastes lousy dialogue on two great actors, Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel, but as it goes forward it becomes an enjoyable cat-and-mouse game between Gage and Bean. National Treasure is formulaic, yes, but a nicely done formulaic, action-thriller."
4,"Lotsa Fun, Don't Think Too Hard","This not-to-be-taken seriously adventure shows off the majesty of several historic American cities, especially Philadelphia and Washington."
3,So-So Action Film,"""National Treasure"" is, for the most part, a standard action film with few surprises. The film does have a sense of humor about itself, which helps, and some of the clues to the mystery are interesting. The best part of the film, for me, are the locations in Philadelphia of Independence Hall and other historic landmarks. Nicolas Cage is okay as the hero, but not unique or very compelling. The special effects are good, especially at the climax.I give it a marginal endorsement, but it could have been better."
4,I Am Legend,"I Am Legend (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)The movie was suspencful, left you wondering what was going to happen next. There was only two things I didn't like: (1)I didn't like what happened to the dog even though he was a hero, (2) the hero, Will Smith character)shouldn't have to die."
3,"Not bad, not as great as I was expecting though.","Maybe it's just me, but I didn't feel the PQ was all that great. Have seen the DVD version a few years ago, and expected the Blu-Ray to be a real keeper, but it just seemed to be ok. Again, maybe it's just me, but It didn't realy impress me.As far as the movie, I think it's a fun, light hearted tale, and is not a bad way to relax and kick back for two hours, I've seen much worse movies, so I'm not complaning!"
4,Good Entertainment,"I didn't think I'd like National Treasure at all. I didn't expect much. But, I was quite surprised. It kept my interest. It had good action. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The history aspects of the film only seemed to add to it. It's definitely an entertaining movie. Yeah, the plot seems far-fetched, and the characters may seem just a tad cliched (or maybe that's just me...) but really you don't notice very much. Is it a perfect movie? No. Not at all. Is it a bad movie? No. Not at all. It's a good, entertaining movie, that I would recommend be seen at least once. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,"If I could give it 10 stars, I would...","This is one of the best movies I have seen. It's has everything - love, action, drama, suspense, etc. I've never been so engrossed in a movie and been so impatient to see what happens next. And Riley was really funny to watch. I recommend the movie to everyone! Don't even rent it, just buy it, and I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,My son would give this 5 stars!,"I was really torn between giving this movie three or four stars, and opted for four, because the movie really works and holds the viewers' attention throughout.Yes, there are flaws. My husband hates this movie. But, really, it's completely entertaining from start to finish and makes real history come alive in a fictional story. What other movie can we think of that can cause a young child to want to print out a copy of the Declaration of Independence, read more about Ben Franklin and even Thomas Edison? And, for those of us who have children already showing an interest in history, this movie is a gift to them.The acting, direction, casting, sets, etc., are all well-executed. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie yet, if you liked Indiana Jones, The Da Vinci code, Rule of Four, or any other adventure stories, you really will enjoy this movie."
4,Excellent....in line of Indiana Jones!!,"Yes, it is true as mentioned by other reviews, this film does fall into the line of the classic Indiana Jones realm. So What??? That genre of movie needs to be brought back!!! :) Cage and company did an excellent job with everything...the story, although somewhat unbelievable in some parts, was very interesting...be sure to rent this one!!!"
4,"A Far-Fetched, but Pleasant, Adventure.","If you are willing to suspend logic, you will see an entertaining story. From previews, I guessed that this would be a take-off on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and it is. We have a search for treasure that begins with a secret message on the Declaration of Independence (What?) and ends in a spooky grotto. Still, everything comes out fine at the end. The story almost lost me at the start. First, they have a stunning blonde in charge of things at the National Archives. Is this the same National Archives that I have visited? Second, the blonde plays fast and loose with the Declaration of Independence. That's even more difficult to imagine. But then the story settles down to one chase after another among our nation's historic sites, so you can just hang on and let it race off in all directions. It should entertain children as well as adults, and I don't recall any cussing, nudity, gore, or sex. That makes it a family picture, so sit back and enjoy it."
3,NATIONAL PROFIT,"Intriguing premise of America's forefathers leaving secret clues to a hidden treasure is given the kiddie comic book treatment in this fun, and tedious, adventure saga. A little more intellect wouldn't have gone amiss, and discerning viewers may mutter to themselves long into the second hour, ""Just find the damn treasure already!"". Nicholas Cage has a 'Romantic treasure hunter? No problem.' conviction and Diane Kruger brings excitement and appeal to her role as a rigid historian turned Santa Claus believer, but the whole lot of treasure hunters and the bad guys chasing them begin to resemble the cartoon cast from the ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoons, complete with Scooby-like chase van. Not a bad thing if you're twelve years old, but like a crummy free toy in your sweetened and forteified cereal box if you're not."
3,A fun movie to watch with the family.,"This film has thrills, chills and a lot of fun. Its a movie that tries to convince the audience that its smarter than it really is. While I enjoyed the movie, I found it to be predictable and the ending was a little cheesy. I felt that it seemed a little like a cheap knock of of the Indiana Jones movies."
5,Wonderful Movie!,"I'm into history and action/adventurey movies are pretty good so this was something that was really good for me. It's one of my favorite movies (next to National Treasure 2 and The Day after Tomorrow). Very good movie, I don't think five stars can even do it justice...more like 10??"
4,National Treasure - The Movie,Very Happy with my purchase. Got it for a gift and the recipient was very happy to get it.
4,Awesome!,A great movie to share with my 8 year old son! It was as good as I remembered. Quality was good and no buffering issues. Better than Netflix streaming.
4,Fun Movie,"This is a great holiday treat, especially since the inevitable sequel is now out...The premise is spotty: that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence. This, of course, requires that the document be stolen so it can be examined.Heart-stopping moments are when this precious document is being thrown around, dropped into the street, etc.Of the two movies, this one is at once more exciting and, if you can believe it, more credible.It also teaches valuable historical lessons, albeit through the distorting lens of fiction. Perhaps that's one of the most distressing qualities: can kids distinguish between historical fact and made-up stuff? As always, extended dialogue after the movie's over is indicated. Adults should carefully separate fact from fiction for the benefit of younger viewers.That being said, the film's a real blast."
5,Splendid action packed movie with Nick Cage,"I love the plot of this movie. It's a thriller, a who done it, action packed with surprises around so many corners in so many directions.My kinda movie. I'm thrilled to add it to my personal movie library."
5,One of my favorite movies ever,"This is a really good movie! A man is searching for the huge treasure that has been told about in his family for many generations, But the villians want it too. It's a race to get the treasure, but they have to figure out how to steal the Declaration of Independence. Like every good movie, the main charachter, played by Nicholas Cage, has a sidekick who is not smart, which makes it even funnier. Riley is great. A lot of suspense and a great story. I would not recommend this for kids 7 and under, because there is some gun shooting, dark tunnels, and explosions. No bad words though. I thought it was great!"
4,It was entertaining.,I don't know why reviewers complained this film wasn't realistic--how many films are? It was a fun show and had a good deal of humor that both kids and adults enjoyed. I don't think they were trying for an Oscar!
5,JUST GREAT ENTERTAINMENT,"A lot of the reviews on this movie have downplayed it as low-brow escapist fair, but this movie is really all about entertaining the viewer. Fast paced and interesting, this is a typical, above average Bruckheimer blockbuster. There really is nothing to dislike. The characters are fun and likeable. The plot races along and the clues--steeped in historical fact--make you wonder if that part of it is true.Most of the sets are located at historical locations like Washington DC, New York, and Philidelphia. There is a lot of historical trivia here that has ended up increasing visitation to historic sites. That has to be a good thing. Of course there is not treasure at the end of the clues, but that does not take away from the appeal of this movie.Additionally, the movie is inoffensive, non-violent and family friendly. How can it go wrong? A good movie to spend an afternoon at."
3,First of all suspend all disbelief.,I've got to believe there are many things that are done to protect the Declaration of Independence from theft (and damage)that we don't know about. It is not going to happen. In this movie Nicolas Cage steals it. Very easily I might add. Now sit back & enjoy the movie. It's good & Cage is always very good. He's not a criminal just a crack-pot professor with a crack- pot father & a theory about a treasure map within the document. Mysteries abound. You'll enjoy it.
4,National Treasure,The DVD was in perfect condition as stated by the seller. It arrivedmuch earlier than stated and The Price was GREAT!
3,Suspension of Disbelief,"Is what you need to keep chanting to yourself during the scientific impossibilities, historical inaccuracies, and other wildly improbable events in this movie. Other than that, it's a fun movie with thrilling special effects. Don't take this any more seriously than a comic book, just let go and enjoy the ride"
1,Worst Performanaces of the Decade,"The story line is pretty darned interesting I must admit. A treasure hidden by the founding fathers that was handed down since ancient Egypt. But the acting performances were so bad you can't enjoy the movie due to the stench. That pretty girl who played Helen in the movie ""Troy"" was so bad I couldn't believe they allow her to act. Albeit we don't need a Meryl Streep for a movie like this, but can't we find a young actress that can deliver credible emotions? And what's up with Harvey Keitel playing a federal agent? That's like asking Hannibal Lecter to play Big Bird... it doesn't match and it comes across as goofy as slap stick comedy. Nick Cage is stuck in that role where he plays psychos and nothing bothers him, what else can explain him acting carefree and debonair after being identified for stealing the Declaration of Independance?I haven't seen a movie suck this bad since ""The Quick and the Dead""."
1,Should have been marketed to kids only,"This is not only Nic Cage's worst film, it's also the worst ""Indiana Jones"" Genre film. It's incredibly implausible, as well as horribly acted. I watched it with my dad, who is a HUGE Nic Cage fan and hed went to be half way through it because it was so bad. I hate it when such good actors sell out and make such bad films. At least with Indiana Jones and The Mummy films, I was able to buy into them and suspend my disbelief. With this film, its just so bad that you cant. The movie invovles a series of clues that Nic is amazingly able to figure out, no matter how vague they are. There are a few blunders in this film that were very obvious--poor job on the script editors part. I am in disbelief that this movie made so much money. I think most kids are smart enough to want a better movie. Rent the Indiana Jones films instead. They are good treasure hunting films with great actors, great scripts and so much more fun than this one."
3,Twinkie,"This is a fun movie! My wife and I have seen it many times. It has the weight and quality of a twinkie. However, it is very enjoyable."
5,very oleyisious,"best darn deal everi bjuty fgtr dfesb kloi[pouy tyhg y,mn uh fg rgdfy sctkbh76 dscuwhbc bjs shuwb w hw"
2,america's critic,"ok ok i was lost to many treasures and running around like a chicken with its head and a foot cut off, i was so confused i turned it off i usually love movies like this but it didnt click to me"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I loved this movie. I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD and have watched it well over a dozen times. Riding on the coat tails of ""the Da Vinci Code"" (as called a poor man's ""Code"") this is a fast past thriller through American and World History. At no point is the movie based on specific historical events (thus the movie can be neither histroically correct or incorrect), but it does talk about known historical facts. This is a wonderfully entertaining fictitious movie. I strongly recommend it to anyone."
3,"Predictible Indiana Jones wannabe, but entertaining","This movie want to be Indiana Jones sooooooo bad!! But Nicholas Cage is no Harrison Ford!! The movie tries a little too hard, but if you sit back and forgive all it's flaws you will be entertained. Definately not a thinkers movie, which is why so many people liked it, I think. The general public does not want to think at the movies (or anywhere else for that matter, but that is a different story), they just want to be entertained and this movie accomplishes that."
3,I did not want to like this movie.,"But I did.It is not great; it is not very good.It is decent entertainment.Now maybe it had something to do with me being trapped in a hotel room in Tucson trying to escape the 109 degree inferno outside. Maybe it had something to do with my being groggy and sleepy (I turned it on at about 1:00 a.m.). But, it was okay.Now, mind you, Nicolas Cage is almost laughably bad, and the dialogue rather stinks. The plot is inane. The characters? Well, they're like that 2-dimensional creature from the old Outer Limits episode ... the one that disappears completely when it turns to the left or right.No matter. Grab the popcorn, go for the ride, laugh a bit, and have a good time.I think."
4,Just plain fun and entertaining!,"I have gotten into many debates with my friend over the quality of this movie. He believes that every movie should be worthy of an Oscar. I just want to be entertained. Needless to say, he hated National Treasure, and I loved it.First of all, this is one of those ""safe"" action-packed flicks, meaning my husband can have his fast-action/fighting needs met, and I don't get grossed out by blood, guts, and violence. The movie is fast paced, exciting, and (despite criticisms) mildly intellectually challenging.Also, the characters are very likable. Yes, the roles are predictable from a mile off. But there were distict ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", with a little bit of romance to keep me hoping but prevents my husband from calling it a chick-flick.I can pop this movie in and casually watch it while cleaning, or invite the whole crew over and know that everyone will have a good time. A great, family friendly action-adventure!"
2,You are Kidding so Ok,This is a film that is really a kiddie movie. Theories of conspiracy should at least be plausible and based on some truth at every stage of twist. This is not even good comic book and Cage should find a real role. He does not make a convincing Indiana Jones character. That said it would be entertaining to11-13 year olds who can keep up with the improbable and ridiculous story.
5,great movie,We love this series of movie and have nothing but good stuff to say about it. Great and fast shipping. Good product and good movie ... we love full screen.
4,National Treasure 2,"While I liked both National Treasure movies, I think the first one was the better of the two. NT2 was still good though, and the price of the DVD was great!"
5,Bonus Features are worth buying alone,"The movie is great, pictures sharp and audio crisp. But this blu-ray has the interactive coverage of the Declaration of Independence. Not only it provides plain-English explanation line-by-line, but any associated pictures and videos. It also allow the viewer to scroll to each of the signer of the document and provide their biography or relevant multi-media articles. This by far is worth gold, especially if you have kids that are just learning it.Kudos to the folks that produced this blu-ray. I just wish other movies could have such a valuable educational bonus interactive content(at this caliber)."
4,A Da Vinci Code Clone that Delivers Without Controversy,"NATIONAL TREASURE is a fast paced Da Vinci Code clone that substitutes American Heritage for Christianity and a huge treasure cache for the Holy Grail. Everyone's favorite secret organization, The Knights Templar, is still there, along with plenty of suspense and intrigue. I liked this film a little better than THE DA VINCI CODE book.As an added bonus, the bullets all miss, the language is clean, and the gore is at a minimum. There is even a little sultry spark without nudity. This movie proves that Hollywood can still create a fun film without rampant vulgarity.My children liked the extras that came with this dvd, especially the chance to figure out the coded passwords that unlocked hidden features."
5,Fun Movie,"Want a fun movie for the whole family? Then get National Treasure. The DVD is also really cool since it gives you the option to unlock more and more stuff as you watch the extras. They put some time into it which makes you feel good for buying the DVD.I'm sure the story has been reviewed...yes it is a little unbelievable at times, but it's supposed to be a fun movie, and the included true historical stuff is exciting if your wife likes history like mine does!"
4,Odd.,"This is a slight ripoff of the Da Vinci Code and Indiana Jones. That said, it's a fun ripoff and that's what really matters, in the whole big scheme of moviemaking. It stars Nicholas Cage as a disoriented and comical man, named Benjamin Franklin Gates. He must, along with allies, steal the Declaration Of Independence. Why??? Because, it has a map to some lost treasure and that happens to be, the ONLY existing map. Really weird. Anyway, good for a PG rated action flick, but the sequel was a lot better and more original."
4,"Enjoyable, but not worth it's weight in gold","Well, this was a good family film and I think the PG rating showed that. On that note, this movie should not be taken for anything with a real film-style intrinsic value.The story is about a man whose family has been chasing the legend of a treasure for centuries, played by Nicolas Cage. Unlike the rest of his family, Cage's character discovers the first clue but in doing so also creates a rival for the treasure. Of course the goal is to get the treasure.Overall I liked the movie. The movie had humor, action, and just enough who-dunit to make the movie watcher not already know most of the plot. So, if you're looking for decent entertainment for the whole family or just you, then this is it, but don't expect to be awed and inspired."
3,Fun but flawed,"The kind of film to watch on a dull evening, National Treasure is pretty hokey, but fun. I wouldn't advise anyone to use this as a basis into historical research or Freemasons as it's got more holes than a pair of fishnet stocking and there are a LOT of factual errors (example - the treasure was found by crusading knights ""beneath King Solomon's Temple"" - which was totally destroyed over 1600 years BEFORE the First Crusade).Others have mentioned this, but bonus stars go to this movie for containing no swearing or sex. Hey, Hollywood - you don't need foul language and naked bodies to make a film worth watching!!!"
3,A GOOD MOVIE JUST NEEDED MORE ACTION!!!!!!,"I wish i could give this movie a higher rating,but it lack on the action!!!! I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones movies and they say this is the next Indiana Jones i have to say not,but it was a good movie it kept me watching the whole time!!!!! The movie just needed more action and that was its problem and it was kinda slow in some parts so if you like this movie than go out and rent it,but i wouldn't own it if i was you!!!!!"
4,A Fun Romp,A great family movie. Lots of tension and action. Integrety and moral values are honored (but not in rigidly dry or self rightious way). Those who are violent and dishonest are loosers.
4,Far-fetched fun family film,"How many more ""f""s could I fit in that review title? Anyway, this film is a fun ride -- lightweight, nothing too deep, with only mild violence and mild language (there may be some ""damn""s in there, I can't remember). You can watch this film with your kids. It's got humor, and some likable characters. The ending is way ""Yeah right, you gotta be kidding me"", but this isn't the sort of film you should take too seriously. Suspend disbelief, sit back, and enjoy the ride. I was surprised by this one -- a fun film."
5,HOW could anyone dislike this movie?!,"I have loved this film since I saw in theaters. I know it's sorta the basic conspiracy theorist idea, but it's amazingly done.ANYONE WHO'S READ THE DA VINCI CODE AND LOVED IT SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!Nicolas cage has never been one of my favorite actors, but he does well. The comic sidekick is hilarious. The woman is a good actress as well. The plot really gets you engaged in the character interactions and the series of clues that eventually lead them beneath a church in New York. The camerawork is impressive. The computer work is nicely done. It's one of my favorite movies, definitely on my top 5 list. I highly recomend it!"
4,Disney Treats the DVD like a kids product,"I wish I could give this DVD package a 5, but can't because of that Disney has done. Many of the best supplimental features on the disk are hidden and the viewer has to solve puzzels, try for easter eggs and other nonsense to get to them. This feature makes a viewer want to throw the disk against the wall or break it in pieces. When I want to see the special features that I have paid for when I buy the disk, I don't want to spend time playing games. This is OK for kids on the childrens releases, but not for an adult film. If you love puzzles, crosswords, translating hyrogliphics and such things, this disk might appeal to you, but it is simply frustrating for many people.This said, the film itself is a lot of fun and very enjoyable."
3,Nice Summer Flick,"This was a good movie. Nice acting, fine cinematography, ok script.....plenty of predictable outcomes."
2,Something of an also-ran,You get the feeling that this film was made in about 2 days with a massive budget and with an overwhelming need to jump on the 'Di Vinci Code' bandwagon. I normally adore this genre but this I found thoroughly disappointing. Shame.
2,"Another ""chase movie"" with a contrived plot",No real cleverness. No real action adventure. It's a scavenger hunt for your hard earned money. Rent it if you must but don't waste your money to buy it.
4,2 unbearable nuisances in this movie drives me nuts!,"1)endless background annoying music, not even 3 seconds without totally unrelated music2)the young sidekick's goat-like mehhhhhehhh voicevery formatted, stereotyped and cliched movie almost every scene, storyline, acting, directing."
3,Poor Characterization,"While the plot itself was so-so, what really grated on me was the character of Ben Gates. He's entirely too perfect. There are other intelligent characters along for the ride, why not let them figure out more clues and make Ben into a more believable character?It bothered me that the female lead was written in pretty much to be a romantic interest even though she was a highly intelligent woman. This movie did not NEED romance and I thought it was misplaced.This movie could have been much, much better."
2,"Cheesy, dopey, a little boring.","A very predictable plot plus lukewarm acting performances equals a movie you can skip. I did manage to get to the end, but not without feeling slightly dirty after watching such a cheesy movie. Don't buy."
1,What ripoff,"This movie is such a ripoff of the Da Vinci Code its frightening. Almost everything about it (except that it takes place in America) is pretty much the same. Also, Nick Cage is overemotional the whole movie. If I could give this movie zero stars, I would."
2,Treasure is left over Junk.,"If you are looking for something remotely new, witty, or original then you may want to avoid the drek that is National Treasure. The movie, starring Nicholas Cage, is a perfect hodgepodge of every action-adventure you've ever seen or read. Start with a sprinkle of Indiana Jones, throw in a dash of The Da Vinci Code, then just two shakes of anything else you can think of and you've made a National Treasure mess cake.The dialogue is so predictable and trite you almost groan with foreknowledge. Cranky old dad? Check. Dastardly villian who's lines were written by a six year old? Check. Beautiful but brainy girl AND quirky sidekick with throwaway one liners? Check. All leading up to a perfectly Disney ending? Double check. So if you're looking for a nice little cotton candy film (you know the kind have big fluff and when you take a bite it all disappears), or have some Cage obession, this will be for you. Otherwise just go grab the Indiana Jones trilogy and enjoy."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,Now if someone had the knowledge AND the balls to tell what the Masons were(are) REALLY up to and what those symbols REALLY mean- now that would be a heckuva movie. Plus this movie was a load from every aspect but hey what do expect from Jerry and co.?
3,Could've been good!,"This movie could've been good, if not for Cage's lack of acting ability. I've seen most of his films and I'm convinced this man can't act his way out of a barrel.The rest of the cast is excellent. Action is quite good. Cinematography is not bad at all."
4,"A good story, but not very memorable","I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it is a very pleasant and entertaining movie.National Treasure, brings to the screen the rather unlikely scenario that the Declaration of Independence has invisible writing on the back leading to a long forgotten hidden Masonic treasure somewhere in NYC.Overall, the acting is very good (Nicholas Cage does a good job), the special effects are excellent, and the plot is definitely original.In short, though not a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching!"
4,national treasure,this is the best movie. its a movie that really keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat!
5,Bound to be liked.,"There is something in this movie for everyone. As an american history buff, I enjoyed this movie for its accurate historical references. Some friends of mine (who describe history as a bunch of stupid wars) enjoyed this movie immensly for the excitement of following a treasure hunt.The romance aspect of this movie was not very well done. It seemed that it was only there because there had to be ""an attraction.""The comedy seemed directed at the younger crowd, but this movie had the perfect amount of action, and one or two ""jump moments.""Loved it."
3,"Fun Ride, But Not Very Believable","Bring along a healthy dose of disbelief suspension and you'll enjoy this action/adventure story in a vein similar to that of the Indiana Jones movies. Don't expect much deviation from the standard formula: the hero, an underappreciated archaeologist, is convinced that he's the only man alive who can unravel a particularly challenging mystery. Just as things start to go his way, the bad guys realize he's their ticket to wealth and chase him for the rest of the movie. In the end everyone gets what they deserve.If you're looking to be entertained by a fun romp with lots of action and interesting clues, National Treasure is worth your time. If you expect some deeper meaning to be revealed or for a film to have an impact on your life, keep looking."
3,Good family flick,"The history buff in me wanted to gouge out my eyes after the first 20 minutes. The mindless dork in me grabbed more popcorn. Check your criticisms at the door, grab your 11 year old son, and have fun. I am glad they still make old fashioned movies like National Treasure."
2,"Not as entertaining, funny and exciting as Indiana Jones.","This movie is not as entertaining, funny and exciting as Indiana Jones. It's worth renting for curiosity."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I was going to give it one star,but as i was falling to sleep after watching it i accidently clicked 2 stars and was too tired to change it back.I had to have alot of caffene to keep me awake.Oh man im going to have to finish writing this review before i doze off."
2,Da Vinci Code Rip-Off Extraordinaire,"Predictable. Unoriginal. The first two words that come to mind if asked to describe National Treasure. Another one...formulaic. Anyone who has read The Da Vinci Code will recognize from the outset of this movie what a blatant and shameless rip-off it is of the best-selling book.For starters, the Knights Templar, The Free Masons, the secret societies, the mysterious and elusive hidden treasure, etc., etc. To make matters worse, I didn't exactly find it absolutey necessary for Nicolas Cage to launch into unprovoked historical pontifications ad nauseam while he deciphered the painfully predictable clues out loud to the audience - all of which made the whole movie nothing more than mindless fodder for the masses.The only thing stopping it from being one star is the stellar acting of Diane Krueger. How she put up with this drivel is beyond me."
1,Puts the corn in corny,"what a load of rubbish..i bought this movie due to its rating on Amazon and for the first time in 10 years was really disappointed in buying a movie based on the vote of the public.To sum up it was silly,pradictable and boring. It was a miss mash of ideas from meny better movies and just did not pull it of."
2,National Stinker,"This film is a bunch of nonsense, a poor mans Indian Jones, badly acted, poorly scripted and a paper thin plot based tenuous links to american history - save yourself a couple of hours of your life and avoid."
5,Was happy with product,I received it on time and in the condition it was suppose to be in. Would buy from this seller again.
4,"Good, clean fun with a few rough spots.","I enjoyed most of this movie. Cage did a mediocre, but otherwise okay, acting job. I love all of the high-tec gadgets, and the whole plot was supurb, but sometimes a little corny and unbelieveable. Delete what I just said and you have yourself some great action in a great flick."
5,A family-friendly adventure,"What a delight to find a movie with no gratuitus sex, profanity, and excess violence. It held our attention from beginning to end, and was a adventure in the spirit of Indiana Jones. Nicolas Cage was great. We give it high marks for great fun!"
3,"Not Citizen Kane, but not Ishtar either...","The critics hated this, but I watched it with no expectations other than to be mildly entertained for a couple of hours. Sure, it's a bit far-fetched, but no more than many other Hollywood films. The comparisions to The DaVinci Code are obvious, but so what. My kids liked it so I figured it money well spent. The Knights Templar are hot right now, but if you need more substance, may I suggest Umberto Eco's ""Foucault's Pendulum"".Think Dan Brown meets Indiana Jones meets The Goonies and you'll get the idea."
4,Good movie for the entire family,"This is a good movie suitable for the entire family. Yeah, the plot is not deep and seems all too convenient. Anyway, it is a great popcorn movie without worrying about kids picking up profanity or adult scenes. Hollywood should release more family friendly movies like this one."
3,A real corn-popper--but worth seeing.,"Lets face it, this movie was written to quickly capitolize on the ""Da Vinci Code"" phenominon. This movie is not nearly as good as ""Da Vinci Code"" was, but if you go for that sort of mystery/treasure hunt/conspiricy theory type of thing, you'll enjoy watching this movie.The main character learns a family legend from his grandfather--there is an unbelievably hugh treasure which was hidden by the founding fathers! They left us clues on various documents and in various famous buildings. An adventure-filled tromp through historic sites ensues.Not exactly Oscar material, but good clean fun for the whole family."
4,Fun and Interesting,Fun exciting movie for all ages. Kids thought it was interesting. Historical elements kept the movie fresh. No bad language or risky scenes. Enjoyed it a lot!
5,Finally found it!,"So loved these movies, had rented them so often that I thought it was time to buy them! Great purchase!"
5,one of the best movies this decade,"the reviewer from dallas, tx is absolute correct, this is a wonderful movie thats stands alone by itself and its one of our classics that will be and is appreciated because its just a great motion picture, its not full of bad words unnessary sex and gore like the dallas observer stated. like so many crappy movies today. my picks of superb movies in this dacade so far is this beauty, superman returns, amazing grace, and finding nemo. outstanding movies that are CLEAN. its old fashioned and aint' it great. thank you for those involved that this movie was made. god bless them."
4,National Treasure (Widescreen Edition),"National Treasure (Widescreen Edition) is a fast paced adventure movie starring Nicolas Cage, Jon Voigt to mention a few. The plot is not all that advanced, and if one was cruel one could call it paper thin and filled with silly plot lines that make no sense at all. However, the movie never pretends to be serious and therefore it never feels phony or forced. The action scenes rock and Cage plays his part well. Highly recommended if one likes adventure movies and does not mind stupid dialog and a totally unrealistic plot."
2,Not up to her standards :-(,"I really, really enjoy S. Lauren's books. This is NOT one of them. The story is very very sappy. If you are looking for a book with plenty of romance and steamy..... this is NOT it! 1 love scene truly over before it began. If you get the chance to read this one, just pass it up. Was not worth the money truly disappointed! Glad her newer stuff is a great deal better."
3,I like her regency-era historicals better,"I started reading stephanie laurens with her cynster series. I grew real used to the sensuality and explicit sex scenes. I was originally disappointed with the somewhat tame nature of this novel. I then discovered that regency novels were different from the historicals. I gave this novel three stars because I prefer her other style of writing. However, this novel is very good. The heroine is a strong female, just like in her other novels. The sex scenes aren't very steamy, but she is talented writer and the novel is very captivating. If you are looking for a novel like the cynster series, I wounldn't bother with this one, but if you are looking for a good regency romance novel, then I highly recommend this novel."
1,Ugh!!,"I loved all the Bar Cynster novels! When I saw Ms. Laurens name on this novel, I assumed that this novel would be of the same strain as the others!! How wrong could one person be?? This book by far was the most boring I have read in several years. I sat through thinking it was going to get better, it finally got better when I finished reading the last page and closed the book!I went and re-read one of her other novels just to get the ""bad taste"" out of my brain from reading this novel! I do not recommend this book at all!"
3,Regency vs. Regency-era historical,"This is a good book in the way of regencies. Antonia is a mature, beautiful woman and I'm thankful that this is not a regency in which the main female character is an indecisive brat. I've read the other reviews in which the people were disappointed with the book, but this is because the type of book they were reading was different from what they expected.A ""regency"" is a romance with rules. There's rarely any blatant sensuality and if you read regencies published in the '70s or '80s (now out of print, they can be found in your local library or purchased used), you oft won't even see a kiss between the heroine and hero until the end. A ""regency-era historical"" is the classification for Cynster books. They are romances set in a time period of the author's choice."
2,Worst Laurens Book EVER,"I have read all of Ms. Lauren's book, and this was far and away the most boring. As one of the other reviewers noted - yes, it is more like a ""Classical"" Regency novel. In other words ... it's a snooze-fest."
1,Snooze,"I love Stephanie Laurens and have read every single book she's put out. This one, however, was a big disappointment. There didn't seem to be a plot. She wants to marry him, he wants to marry her. She wants to wait until after the Little Season. He agrees. That's it. They go to parties and he's proud of the way she handles herself, she feels she can make him a good wife and at the end, they're in love. I just saved you reading the book, aren't I helpful?But please, read all of her other books!!"
2,A Comfortable Wife - too comfortable - enough to be a yawn!,"As an avid Stephanie Laurens reader - this book was just not up to par with her other books. I loved her Cynstar series books, but I really had to struggle to finish this one, and when I did I was disappointed. If you love her other books - I suggest that you pass this one - it is not up to the Lauren's style of sensual storylines with well-thought out characters."
1,Waist of Time,"This was the third Lauren's book that I read and was not very impressed. This book had one to many ""humphs"" and enough about Catriona and Ambrose!!!! This story lacked focus on the main characters. I recomend the Cynster books not this. Skip this and go to the series. They are well worth your time."
4,A wonderful story!,I absolutely love Stephanie Laurens and this book just shows how wonderful a writer she is!
1,Ho-hum(yawn),This is the most boring book I have read this year. You can easily read every third page (just so you don't feel guilty for spending the money)and greatfully get to the end in an hour.
1,Disappointed,I usually like Stephanie Lauren's books especially the Cynster Series(with Devil's Bride being my favorite). I was really disappointed with this one!
3,Exhausting reading,"The ""Little Season"" portion of the book was drawn out (just one Ball after another), Hoo Hum. The side story about Catriona was unnecessary/not interesting."
2,Not quite it.,"I was reading this book and I'm waiting for something to happen and it never quite gets there. I put the book down when I have nothing better to do, but I don't want to read it either. I find my self saying okay one more chapter and ... nothing. Antonia is fine, Philip is fine, but there is always a descritpion of her reaction to him, his to her, but it just falls flat after that. This book had great promise but Ms. Laurens just doesn't deliver. The pages just go on and on about nothing. It wasn't difficult to give up on this book in the middle of page 140. I don't know what happened after and I don't really care. I'm wondering why am I waisting time on this book when there are four new books waiting for me to get into. When you're in the midst of reading a book, you shouldn't be thinking of another book. I'm still a fan of Stephanie Laurens, but not of this particular book."
3,I didn't feel the history part of this story.,"""Or Give Me Death: A Novel of Patrick Henry's Family"" is an Ann Rinaldi book that did not feel like an Ann Rinaldi book. I became confused with the book starting out with the protagonist as Patsy, and then switching to Anne. I think it would have been better to stick with one and go with it (Anne being the best choice). The ending was much too abrupt for my liking - as if Rinaldi reached her page quota and ended it right there. I'm also used to her having epilogues - I wanted to know what became of these people, since you rarely learn anything about Patrick Henry. I ""sorta"" recommend"
1,So bad it's hilarious!,"Ann Rinaldi's ""historical"" novel about Patrick Henry's family is an abomination. I suspect that she used Williamsburg ghost tours as the basis for her ""research."" Every page demonstrates a thorough lack of information and even worse -- a complete contempt for the reader.On a brighter note, Or Give Me Death is currently being passed around by history teachers and interpreters for a little comic relief. If you have some familiarity with history, this novel is funnier than Captain Billy's Whiz Bang!"
2,dissapointed,"i'm very dissapointed with this book. The whole story idea sounds fascinating, but. you see the book opens out with the point of view of Patsy, the oldest child in Patrick Henry's family. You really build a bond with her, when she crys you cry for her as well. Then her part abruptly ends and goes on to her sister Anne. Anne goes on and on about how evil Patsy is and she turns the readers against Patsy. So by the end of the book you hate Patsy but you also hate Anne for turning your image of Patsy to a bad one. The story itself ends tragicly as well. I total this is a book where nothing good seems to happen to break up the bad parts. i give it two stars for the Patsy part but overall i don't reccomend this book. i'm dissapointed also because there was hardly any mention to historical events and life. This book will leave you feelin crummy. don't read it."
4,A Review from Scotchtown,"As a guide at Scotchtown, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt that Ms. Rinaldi brought the house to life with the voices of Mr. Henry's children. The Henry family dealt with complicated issues in growing up 200 years ago just as young people must deal with difficult issues today.Just to clarify a point, however--Sarah was not kept in the dry well. Scotchtown has a summer bedroom in the English basement, which is very typical for any 18th century Virginia home, and it is there that Sarah stayed during her tragic illness. It has windows for sunlight and a fireplace for heat in winter. Given the options that Mr. Henry had for her care and that we believe he loved Sarah very much, it was the best he could do at the time. The dry well is a completely separate structure used only for food storage. [...]"
5,Review,I got this historical novel because my son was reading it in school and wanted to discuss it with me. I am very glad I did. This is the story of Patrick Henry's family during the time of the American Revolution; during a time of great stress for them. It's told from the viewpoint of the two oldest girls and is a fascinating read. The author has taken meager records and historical facts and woven them into in gripping story.
5,Not your boring standard set of blocks,"I bought it for my 7 yr old, 4 yr old, and 1 yr old boys for Christmas. At first, they did not play with it too much. But a week after Christmas, after the excitement of the highly commercialized toys they received wore off, they began playing with these blocks. We live overseas, and they began to see that they can build things that look like places we've seen. They spend a lot of time quietly building things, and they get excited to see each other's creations. They call their old set of standard blocks ""boring."" I can see the wheels of imagination spinning in my 7- and 4-yr olds. The 1-yr-old is really developing his fine motor skills with the blocks. What I like about these blocks is that simple or complex architectural structures can be built, depending on age/skill level. Even I have to use my brains to build things."
1,It's not possible.....,"It's not possible to build a sock that fits a size 6 and a size 12. I bought these socks and I am a size 11.5, and guess what....they slide down under my heel while I'm wearing my shoes which is really annoying. Then when I pull my foot out of my shoe the sock stays in the shoe.I couldn't be more dissatisfied with this product. The only way this will work for you is if you are a size 6-9. Be careful...."
5,Best Book I have ever read :),I just finished reading the book..and after I just thought to myself=wow. So many things started to click and make sense..things that I have been struggling with seemed not as difficult to deal with. I reccomend this book to every woman-and man on the earth. There is so much love and warmth in the book and I think it was the best book she has written so far-I truly thank her for sharing this book with me:)
5,When You Need to Hear the Truth From Someone Else,"""Secrets About Life Every Woman Should Know"" is a good book to read when you've reached a point in your life where you feel like something is missing, but you can't put your finger on what it is, and you have a nagging suspicion that overall, things could be better.The principles DeAngelis discusses aren't in fact ""secrets."" Most of them are principles that we know to be true deep down inside, but we need to hear them from someone else in order to believe them. For example, DeAngelis offers that until we love ourselves, we will not be able to give love to another.If you start to live by these principles, your life most certainly will change for the better and you will be on your way to a greater sense of personal fulfillment."
4,Great Quick Think Book,"This book is wonderful to simply pick up and read a page and give yourself a mini-daily encouragement experience. It is set up in a calendar format, but I enjoy flipping through and reading whatever comes up."
4,Provides a meaningful way to start the day,"I read the daily reading for this and Joyce Meyer's Start your Day Right. They balance each other nicely. ONe is more spiritual and universal (SOM) and the other more down to earth and concrete. When I travel, I copy the pages so that I don't have to bring the books on my trip, but I never leave the readings home."
5,365 Science of Mind,"Positive Life Changing Daily Lessons. I have found this book very inspirational. A philosphy, a faith, a way of life."
3,Interesting Inspiration,"The overall tone is slightly contrived. It doesn't ""feel"" right. Could be better. Unless you are familiar with ""Spiritual Mind Treatments"" it will sound really weird."
5,Love and Death,"A young yankee soldier, Levi Coffin, a sharpshooter with his Spencer rifle during a fierce battle kills everyone he can see. Sick of all the killing he deserts and makes it to California.While waking the early morning he espies a person swimming to shore and waites to meet him. This man was a prisoner in Austrailia as punishment for his many crimes while living in England. Errin Scanlan was on a sailing vessel and allowed to jump ship and swim to shore by the captain who was grateful to Errin for his help in stopping a mutiny. From there a great story unfolds."
4,Provocative book,"I read this book yesterday and just ate it up. It's not the usual esoteric examination by Butler. (Not that anything is wrong with that and I've read her other work, as well).That said, the book is written for a lay audience and I think that this book needed to be published, since the responses of feminists to or after Sept 11th have been far and few. (Aftershock is a great book to read about Sept 11th from a feminist point of view).I can't pinpoint what my favourite section of the book was, however, I enjoyed it all. It was refreshing to see a political theorist write about something ""real"" that is taking place today that many are discussing or living through.This is a wonderful addition to her writing repertoire. I do hope to see her write more for a lay audience, since hopefully they will get their curiosity piqued and read more Butler."
4,The only Judith Butler book,"I thought Precarious Life was great. Her previous work always sounded like a dreary parody of ""postmodern criticism"" to me, and I couldn't be bothered trying to slog through any of it. She's obviously going for a wider audience with this new one. It's working."
2,Another Other,"Judith Butler is out of her depth in her discussions of Israel,and (the new) anti-semitism.Readers searching for understanding of post-9/11 politics will encounter lopsided arguments here."
2,Misleading Listing,"The songs are fine, but the listing shows CDG while the detail shows audio disc. Since there are no on screen prompts (CDG format), its not much good for Karaoke?"
5,As charming as the original old time radio broadcasts.,"This remastered CD returns the Cinnamon bear to it's original quality. The story is full of adventure, and excitement that my two children love. Some of the terminology used is rather out dated, but it doesn't detract from the story, although it does require a little explination from time to time. My children didn't know what a ""looking glass"" was. This is definitely wholesome, worthwhile entertainment."
1,Boing Boing on Kindle makes little sense,"As Boing Boing tends to be rather link heavy, it really doesn't work all too well on the Kindle.Sure, they write their own stories from time to time, but for the majority of their items, you're going to be clicking links to other sites to get the ""full"" story.Works well on your PC...not so much on the Kindle."
1,Its no fun on a Kindle,"I am echoing another reviewer, but if you are looking for a blog for your Kindle, this is not for you. It is full of links, graphics, and other things that just don't work on an e-reader. I am surprised that they even offer it--it is so poor that I have no desire to see the blog in another format."
1,Uninformed Author,"The book vacillates between bad judgement, factual errors, and bad fiction. The pricing is misguided, a good share of the captions are factually incorrect, and far too many of the pieces pictured have not been properly cleaned. Any collector who is only slightly informed knows more about the genre than this author does. As a University Prof, I have used this book in the classroom to demonstrate that being in print ""doesn't make it so.""William Freeman"
3,ok,I bought this case to carry my insulin to work without taking the vial. It's nice but I found the plastic case could be a little tougher. It seems flimsy.
2,"Great idea, but not for U shaped peeler",Almost impossible to replace the blade in the U shapped peeler that I prefer. I haven't yet tried it with the straight peeler.
2,Always stay sharp with OXO Good Grips i-series peeler Rplacement Cartridge!,This item was long overdo in coming to the market. Keep an extra blade on hand and never struggle to peel fruit or potatoes. The replacement blades are sharp and one need never worry about dull or rusty peeler blades. Thank you OXO
2,Not Very Erotic,"I guess I was expecting something quite different, but this collection of supposed ""best"" stories of the year left me, excuse the pun, limp. I think I could crank out better stories without breaking a sweat. Just shows that the best erotica was written in England a century ago."
4,"Pleasant Instructor, Fairly Gentle Pace","I understand that it wouldn't be for everybody, but I enjoy this routine. I think the instructor, Katy Appleton, is quite pleasant and does a nice job explaining what to do. The moves are linked together well and go at a mostly slower flow that I can keep up with. Probably would not hold the attention of power yoga users. At the end I feel worked out but relaxed, not beat up. Katy says it is a blend of Iyengar, Ashtanga & Sivananda yoga. The whole routine from start to finish is rather lengthy, but the DVD is broken up into several chapters so you can do just parts of it, which works well for me. Geri Haliwell doesn't instruct, but she does interject comments from time to time. I thought it made it feel kind of like a class with a friend. My one complaint would be that sometimes the modifier, a young man named Nate, seems left out of the practice."
4,Fun read!,"We are fans of James Marshalls' snarky style, so are pleased to own this book now. I'd suggest borrowing it from the library first if you're new to James Marshall."
2,Don't buy the paperback version,"The colors are dull and the book is very flimsy. The cover and pages inside are too thin and bend easily, so it's difficult to hold up and read. We have a lot of children's paperback books and this is the only book I've received of this low quality. It's definitely not worth the purchase."
1,bastardization of classic tale,"This auther takes too many liberties, & goes outside the true story. Goldilocks is portrayed as very mischievous, the illustrations are too fussy, story seems offkilter."
1,Goldilocks...,THe story of glodilocks is more than just story that will put your child to sleep. If one reads deeper into the story they can find morals instilled. These fairytales are a great way to teach young children many lessons. Depending on the version read one may be able to extract many different views. Not only does it depnd on the authors views but also the background of the reader(you)
5,Heartbeat is an 'Up-beat' CD,This is a wonderful CD by the Oak Ridge Boys -- the first with Steve Sanders singing baritone. I highly reccomend that you get it for your CD collection as CDs with Steve Sanders singing on them are getting harder to find.
5,"Attractive, functional tray","I have other wire, mesh office equipment, and this tray matches it well. I also like that it is front loading, which is quite convenient."
3,Buyer Beware,I was misled by the advertising. I thought I was getting 8 packs of Waterman cartridges for $5.96. When I got the package in the mail there are only 8 cartridges for $5.96. You can get 8 Waterman cartridges for a lot cheaper from other Sellers.
3,"Dark black ink, but not for bad paper","This black ink behaves well and looks good on good paper. However, it prints right through bad paper, and marks in this ink on bad paper expand quite a bit. This ink is not very water-resistant, and it is not safe for writing checks."
5,Life Changing Music,"I've listened to these Etudes dozens of times and haven't got the slightest bit tired of them. Pretty certain that I could listen to them hundreds of times and not get tired of them. It goes without saying that the Concerto for Solo piano is the most powerful, most important of the works.Concerto for Solo Piano is among (if not the) finest works of 19th century music that is not well-known. Not just so full of notes, but so full of meaning on all levels musical and literary. Listening to this performance I not only feel like I have a good understanding of Alkan, I feel like I understand Gibbons. What a great artistic success, hats off to you Jack Gibbons, time and time again you've been my man of the hour!"
5,"fantastic ***** as good as Hopkirk's ""Great Game""","""Younghusband"" by French is well written and well researched. Add a bit of the author's own adventure and humor while researching this book and you really have something. For those who are obsessed with Great Game History this book is a must. Patrick French has found lots more info on Younghusband and after reading it one has a better picture of all the explorers and military men in the Victorian period."
2,Don't waste your money,"When our oldest was born, we received some door guards as a gift and I quickly fell in love with them. Since our two oldest were born close together and are both boys, they were constantly trying to slam doors on each other. The door guards were an awesome way to prevent finger pinching! When our youngest became mobile and I couldn't find the door guards in our stash of baby safety products, I went looking for new ones. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any like we had before, so I bought these from Safety 1st. What a joke! They are too squishy and quickly broke. I tried using Gorilla glue to fix one, but that only worked to a point. The glue held fine, but the guard no longer fit the door quite right. I definitely recommend the harder door guards -- they still squeeze to fit around the door, but won't break when your child slams the door."
1,Defective--not tough enough to be safe,"We bought three of these about a month ago. We put two on one door, but the door, blown by a gust of wind, crushed and sliced through them. Do not use these if you live in a windy place!We had a similar product from another manufacturer before that was strong and resilient enough to survive a gust-blown door trying to slam shut. Unfortunately, this product is inadequate."
1,A waste of Money,"This is such a wide foam piece that it does not work on my old doors. My house was built before 1900 and clearly these things are going to rip my doors from the hinges (it did that in my bathroom). And seriously, WHY the huge shipping charge? Don't bother with these. Go to your local kids shop and ask to try one before you take it home. I will be returning these. Too bad I won't get my 19.95 in shipping returned as well."
2,"Very good translation, but...",The binding was unglued when I received it and the print on alot of the pages was faded...from 1 to 5 on fading I would say some pages were at a 3 as far as darkness of font. I love the translation..but am not happy with the product I received. Mom and Pop organization that prints it off. Nothing wrong with that...but as I mentioned earlier you can tell it is not done professionally.
5,great stuff,"ok, well ive given out my fair share of 5 stars, but this is certainly deserving. i didnt buy it originally, just downloaded it, because of the fact i usually listen to mainstream rap on MTV and BET. so i downloaded this, and since burning it, it didnt leave my cd player until i bought a copy. tracks like 'back that azz up' and 'slow motion' are quality, and so is 'ha' and 'mamma got ass'. there arent many low points on the this album, as juve drops heat on every track. its certainly different to eminem and 50 cent, and im now a big fan of cash money because of this joint. buy it."
3,Not as good as Grandpa's,The VL-EB valve lapper is better than a twizzle stick for lapping valves but I was disapointed by the poor build quality. It'll keep the blisters off your palms but don't expect to use it for production work.
1,"The thread is 100 Yards, not 150 yards","The thread is 100 Yards, not 150 yards.The thread is 100 Yards, not 150 yards.The thread is 100 Yards, not 150 yards."
1,The Guy who was riped off,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM AIRSPLAT!!!!! They clamed it is the exact same as the BE steyr. The gun performs VERY POORLY. SO even though you may be buying a firepower m8 you are really buying a $33 BE Steyr. If you want a cheap rifle go to their website and order it for $33. DO NOT BE DOPED LIKE ME!
4,Oracle,"I take issue with the reviews describing Oracle as ""confined"" or ""bound"" in her wheel chair when clearly from how she gets around and even fights,she is far from confined or bound,I find these words rather in a negative connotation,yes,she is in a wheel chair but by no means is she limited by it."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"This is the beginnings of the fine Birds of Prey series. Barbara Gordonis Oracle, and confined to a wheelchair. She becomes partners withBlack Canary, who provides the legwork for some operations to capturecriminals, disrupt terrorists, retrieve beasties or whatever else thecomputer genius Gordon decides needs to be done."
2,A Painful Ride,"Ben Pipestone has betrayed his ex-wife Clara, and this book is full of their pain and its effects on their daughter Anna (Annie.) They decide to ride with Ben's father and a group of Lakota on a commemorative ride to Wounded Knee in the dead of winter to remember the massacre of Big Foot's people in 1890.The grueling journey could be seen as a metaphor for Ben and Clara's struggle for reconciliation, but I found it a painful ride indeed. I didn't think this was one of Kathleen Eagle's best efforts, but usually I'm a big fan of her books."
2,I didn't care for it,"I hate to say it, but I didn't care for this book. I won't get into the plot as the other reviewers did I nice job summarizing it. I wanted to like this book, but it was too boring for me. I just could not get into it. I wanted to know more about the decisions Ben made and why he cheated. This book didn't satisfy me."
4,Perfect for envelopes,"After comparing several items, this seemed to be the right dimensions and it was; fits nicely on my cabinet shelf to hold different tax mailing envelopes (#10). Two will be even better than one. It's simple and functional, nothing fancy naturally, for about 12 bucks."
5,"Great Sound, Great comfort, Great Price!","I left my Shure E2C ear buds on a plane. Looking for a cheap replacement, I went with the highly rated Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia In-The-Ear Headphones. They lived up to their recommendations. Highly recommend them. They Sound great and with three ear-buds sizes you are assured a good fit!"
5,Much better than stock earbuds,"I bought these b/c the headphones you get with the sony mp3 player were not fit for my ears. Whenever I tried to workout with them on, they would fall out within a few minutes (they are the hard kind) - these ones stay on but take a little time to get used to. Plus you get a few different sized cushions to choose from."
1,No luck,"I would not buy these again! A friend of mine had them and they looked cool so I gave them a shot but the order got here late and one of the earplugs didnt even work. I guess its a miss or hit with these, and I hate products like that. I got the 71 Fontopias and I love those now. Much better."
4,Good headphone for a Good price,"Headphones are pretty decent, well round sound, however i felt the trebles were a little too much, and it was real hissy when u heard your artist sing the letter ""s"".Overall, good product."
