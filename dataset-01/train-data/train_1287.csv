3,No instructions or customer service,"The smoker is great. I bought this because my boss has the same model and has smoked mouth-watering whole chickens.My only gripe is that the smoker shipped with an owner's manual for the Smoke 'N Grill/Cook 'N Cajun smoker. These are charcoal smokers, not propane. While some of the components are the same or similar, it was still confusing putting it together. I also believe I received a set of screws and bolts for those other models as I ended up with a bunch of extras that don't fit in any of the pre-drilled holes. Good thing I had enough of the right sizes to put the all-in-one together. To make it worse, the 800 numbers for customer service rang to busy signals all day long. My emails to Brinkmann's also went unanswered. Maybe they have a lot of similar problems??? Luckily Amazon has the owner's manual available online now -- Brinkmann's own website does not."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Bought this for my birthday last summer. After less than a year being used no more than 10 times it is in really bad shape:1. The painted steel base lost the paint close to the propane burner and it started to rust.2. There are two rods on the grill that were not properly welded.3. The galvanized pan where that holds the stones / charcoals is rusting.As a charcoal smoker it was very good, cooked some good ribs. As a gas smoker or a gas grill it was very inefficient,heat losses everywhere and it took forever to cook something.I will only recommend this product If you want something that will last a year or two while you save some money to buy a better set."
3,Short,"This really does offer a lot, but is very short when used as a grill. We will need to build a cart or something for this to sit on to make grilling easier on the back!"
1,Terrible Packaging!! NEVER AGAIN!!,"I was so disgusted with the arrival of my smoker, specifically the packaging. I was anxiously awaiting for it as it was a birthday present for my husband. I had decided to give it to him in the morning so he could use it that day to cook for company. Unfortunately that did not work out. It was bought as new and six different items were MISSING from the package (screws, handles, pan, bolts, manual)! I was so embarrassed b/c I already had over 5 lbs of meat thawed ready for my husband to use the new smoker and now I have company coming with nothing for them to eat b/c somewhere along the way, AMAZON didn't do a quality review on all the items included in the package. I am in the process of trying to get a replacement but in the meantime I am out of luck. I have been a faithful AMAZON customer but now am going to rethink my AMAZON purchases since apparently the quality review of the packaging to make sure all items are there did not exist for the brinkman smoker."
4,One Way To Smoke,"This is great for us who can not use charcoal where they live. The only thing missing is the charcoal taste, but works well for smoking and grilling."
1,cheap,I no problem assembling this great idea went to use it the paint caught on fire melted a hole in the barrel of this nice idea could have used better grade of metal and better grade of paint. still wait
5,wicked fast delivery,"we ordered this as Christmas gift on a monday, it came in on thursday with all of the parts and no damage to the box."
4,good all around,read about this at www.thebarbecuemaster.com bigals review and recipes work out fine with this smoker
3,Beware the cover,"I bought this book sight unseen for my 7-year-old nephew. His mother told me that the publisher included ads for other books on the back cover and they included sexually-related topics. Given this publisher's practice, I can only recommend the book with a warning to not give it to children."
5,To educate yourself before reading another Native selection,"In order to understand the ramifications of the latest Native American title, author, subject, you must first read this book. Don't hesitate to take notes. There is no substitute for the insight provided by ""Captured in the Middle."" Your understanding of Native peoples (in addition to that of available Native literature) will only elevate from the minimal plateau supplied by similarly charged works (e.g. Fergus M. Bordewich) to genuine comprehension."
1,Buy somewhere else,I was hust looking at toddler beds and i heard that they have false advertising. You can get somthing just like for a little more money from one step ahead and it looks so much better than this one.
5,Great quality product perfect for your little princess,"I love this bed and so does my daughter. It did take a little time to put together but overall it was easy and well worth is because it is undoubtably sturdy. It is made of solid wood and hand painted. I read a poor review on this and I have to disagree. Although the bed does differ slightly but only because there are not gold band around the middle of the poles.This bed is very low to the floor, perfect for your little one's first big girl bed. I have purchased this bed and a train table from kidkraft and have been highly satisfied with their quality."
2,"Nice, but SMALL","We bought this bed for our daughter when she was turning 2 as her first big girl bed. She loves it, but she is now only 3 and quickly outgrowing it. If I had to go back, I wouldn't have bought it. She can barely move around in it now. While I like how it's low to the ground, I just don't think it's worth how small it has become, so quickly."
4,Perfect for a princess,First off I do have to say the bed seems a little small. But it fit my daughters mattress from her crib just perfect! She loves it. I thought this was a great buy. Might I also mention I ordered mine from Amazon's baby Age they are a lot cheaper and really fast shipping. I ordered mine Tuesday and received that Thursday I was really impressed with their service and highly recommend them. Overall it's easy to assemble may need 2 ppl very sturdy and extremely cute! Thanks
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BED!,"I ordered this bed in April for my 2 1/2 year old. The shipping date was supposed to be 7/5/05. When the date came around, I checked my account to see if it had been shipped yet, but there was no record of the purchase of the bed. I called customer service, and no one had an answer for me. I received an e-mail a week later stating that I would not be getting a bed at all! It said that the company was not able to accomodate so many orders for this bed. If I would have known this I would not have waiting 3+ months for a toddler bed!"
4,Great Princess Bed!!,My daughter absolutely LOVES this bed. Its so cute and just perfect for my 2 year old transitioning to a bed. A few pieces did arrive broken/damaged (which is why I'm deducting a star) but we were able to fix them with superglue and screws. A decal piece was detached and easily glued on. I was really nervous to order this bed after reading the reviews but so glad that I took the chance!
3,Cute bed but.....,We purchased this for our daughter for when she sleeps over her grandparents house. It's made from press board and flimsy wood solids. Your child will quickly out grow this so if you really want it shop around and find a good price.
5,sterling silver celtic knot pentacle ring,i love this ring and wear it everyday. spins smoothly. i ordered this in a size 15 and i wear this as a thumb ring. i bought a ring very similar to this from a wicca supply store in houston for a pinky ring but this one is so much better. fantastic.
3,"Nice spin, close, but not quite","This is a spin ring with a pentacle in it. This means that the ring is composed of two bands - the inner band fits your finger and the outer band with the design can move/spin freely around the inner band. It spins very well.It has two other glyphs on it (not shown) aside from the pentacle. I have no idea if they are supposed to mean anything, but they are less complex than the pentacle and are not spaced evenly. I was expecting more pentacles or just the one, so in my opinion, this detracts from the ring.Although the ring is solid and is functionally sound, I have two major issues. First, the celtic band is cut shoddily so in some cases it's practically undefined. Second, the 'dark' areas are actually very light so only provide low contrast, which doesn't make the designs stand out.I give this product a 3 because there technically isn't anything *wrong* with it, but I don't feel it's as nice as it's presented on this website."
5,A dramatics fan,It was in excellent condition. I was sent as repesented. I had no problem with the sound or quality.Thank you
4,A Sparkling Double Play!,"I am far from being a Robert Parker fan. I read two of the Spenser books a few years ago and found them to be shallow and uninteresting. I received Double Play as a gift and did not expect much. However, I was very pleasantly surprised and sailed through this book. Parker tells a wonderful story of the recovery, awakening, and redemption of a phyisically wounded and psychically damaged World War II vet hired as Jackie Robinson's bodyguard. Parker's portraits of life and race relations at the time provide a fascinating backdrop to the story. My opinion may be influenced by my being a lifelong baseball fan and history buff and enjoying the portrayal of Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers, gangland New York, along with 1947 America. However, Double Play kept my interest and I savored the pages and characters all the way through."
2,Bobby strikes out,"There isn't much to this book. Half of it seems to be""Bobby"" Parker's irrelevant autobiography. Then you get about ten baseball box scores, right out of the newspapers. The rest of it purports to tell how Jackie Robinson broke into baseball, but I couldn't believe a word of it. Did gangsters really have shootouts in the grandstand? Not likely! And if they did, it would have taken twenty more years before the game became integrated. Robinson was required to avoid confrontations, not to hire hitmen to watch his back."
4,Well Worth Reading!,"Double Play is a mixture of historical ""faction"", baseball and, of course, thriller. It takes place in 1947 when Jackie Robinson is breaking into baseball and Parker's new hero, Burke, is hired by the Dodgers to be his bodyguard. I have not been a huge fan of Robert Parker over the years, but the basic plot of Double Play captured my interest. Having just finished it, I found it to be extremely fast reading, ""right on"" in capturing the mood of the period in time in which the story takes place, and exciting. While Parker's prose are sparse, his dialogue is very effective and his characters, while not developed quite enough for my taste, are very interesting. Overall, Double Play is well worth reading and can be read in one sitting if you have a few hours to devote to it. I'm looking forward to Parker's next book featuring Burke, and Double Play has made me enough of a Parker fan to now go back and read more of his books."
3,ANOTHER TYPICAL PARKER,OKAY----IT WAS NOT A SPENSER---I'LL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH.BUT---IT WAS JUST LIKE 20 OTHER PARKERS THAT YOU HAVE READ.THE ONLY INTERESTING ANGLE WAS THE JACKIE ROBINSON ANGLE.P.S.---WHAT WAS UP WITH THE BOX SCORES??? I WAS WAITING FOR THEMTO BE TIED IN TO THE STORY SOMEHOW--NADA!!--NOTHING!!--NO WAY!!
4,Almost a homer.,"This gripping page-turner is a genre-jumping amalgam of historical fiction, sports novel and thriller. Hard-edged most of the way, and ultimately very effective, DOUBLE PLAY falters late in the game; it becomes mushy in the odd ""Bobby"" sections (which for me never really came together) and in the male-bonding passages between the hero (Burke) and Robinson.Throughout, the prose is lean, the dialogue is superb and the characters are very well drawn. All in all, you won't go wrong if you're looking for a solid summer read that's head and shoulders above a lot of popular fiction."
5,Damn Good Read,"It has to be the same Robert Parker, as when he writes about Spencer and Jesse Stone. Short chapters, that move one to the next, with anticipation. Great story line, with well developed characters. Just an all around fantastic way to spend a couple hours.Don't really know if Jackie Robinson really had a bodyguard, but if he did, he should have been just like Joseph Burke. Burke came home from WW II wounded, not just physically, but mentally as well. Tried his hand at boxing and failed. Then got the job of being the bodyguard for Robinson and the story continues. Just a whole lot of great reading from one of our best authors. Parker says so much in one page that it would take chapters to say for any other author."
3,a little slow,A little too slow moving with few surprises. Quick read. Interesting period piece but I was hoping for a more intimate story about Jackie Robinson.
1,Terrible!,"I found this book full of nothing! Very poorly written, no suspense, too corney! Reads like it was written in a day! Bought it for $1 at Walden Books. Now I know why! Wish I had my dollar back! I won't read any more from this author!"
3,Easy Read. Little Suspense,"This was a fun and easy read. However, like most of Parker's later writing, this book lacked the sense of danger one would hope to get from a crime drama. Burke (the main character) simply (and I do mean ""simply"") kills anyone who threatens him and then the book is over. This is similar to most of the later Spenser books, but without the sparkling, funny dialog of a Spenser book.I enjoyed the portrayal of Jackie Robinson, the baseball details, and the insertion of the old style box scores. Parker's prose is, as usual, tight, clear and crisp. But, like his character Burke, the book seems emotionally distant.Sitting on a beach and want to breeze through something fun? This is your book."
3,Nice Tape for a Trip,"The tape version of his book consists of Mr. Burns reminiscing about his wife Gracie. He does not read the text of the book, but hits all the main points in his own inimitable way. Well, three stars just because it's a good experience, refreshing to hear that there was once an America where a vaudeville comedy duo could travel together for a long period of time and not have sex together until they were married. The interpolated material from old radio broadcasts is welcome, but sometimes there are extensive musical excerpts that lead nowhere. Such filler I can live without. This tape has been around for awhile so you may want to get it while you can."
5,You can feel the love in the writing.,"George Burns may have been a comedian, but he wrote one of thebest love stories ever! This book starts from the beginningof his first encounter with Gracie Allen. He chronicles theircareers and home life with honesty and truth. I don't believehe left anything out! This was one of the few books I haveread that made me laugh out loud, and sob like a baby. I didnot want the book to end! George wrote with so much love andhonesty, it gave me a new understanding of this great person.God bless his memories!"
4,Little disappointed,"Ok I'll have to be honest and say that I was a little dissappointed at first when I listened to this CD. The beginning is awesome with a short intro and a great opening song(Walking tightropes), which would have to be my favourite song. Then it's ""It ain't all over"" which is good aswell. My favourites are Walking tightropes,It aint all over, going on tour, day off, what you see is what you get. I loved the rhymes but I think what it lacked was good music production on some songs. Anyway thats me but unless you enjoy Aussie hip hop I wouldn't hold my breath."
2,Not Worth It,I have been looking at this puzzle for my kids for awhile. This is not a puzzle at all. The word puzzle would lead you to believe that there would be a challenge in putting this together. My two year old was done with this puzzle in minutes and was uninterested in it within 20 minutes. I would not recommend
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HARRY POTTER FANS!!!,"I love this game! If you've played the first game and learned all of the cool spells, you'll be amazed at how many new spells you learn, plus you remember all the old ones without having to do the classes over. You meet Professor Lockhart, the sorting hat, and lots of other new people. And now you can buy things with the Bertie Botts Beans you collect! Things like flobberworm mucus and wiggentree bark to make potions, wizard cards, a Nimbus 2000 to make you fly faster in Quidditch, and protective armor for flying without getting hurt! Visit new places like Dumbledore's office, the Forbidden Forest, and hidden passages! There are many more things to find too, like keys and even more wizard cards! The only thing I've actually had a REALLY hard time with was Aragog. I totally reccomend this game to anybody ages 7-60. You won't regret it, it's definately worth the money."
4,A pleasing game,"To get the bad stuff out of the way, the graphics suck. Someone forgot the anti-aliasing when they did the game. It's full of jagged ends. The game is easy for an adult (it's really a kids game), but the easiness is fun. I played the game for 6 hours one day. It's kind of addicting. I just wish the graphic were better."
4,If you like Harry Potter....,"If you enjoy the Harry Potter books then I say this game is a must. It is not a FPS or anything of the sort, it is an exploration game and puts you right into the Hogwarts school. I found it very enjoyable and it adds a dimension to the books, that without the game, you will not perceive.For the price, and the Potter fan, a good buy."
5,Haza Potty,"First of all may we congradulate EA games on creating such a fine gameing experiance. We were enthralled right from the opening scene, in which Harry crash lands the car into the amazingly detailed wamping willo tree.The game itself is rich in detail and bursting with good graphics.However this does cause some problems as it means you spend more time looking at the loading screen than actually playing the game.This is a small price to pay for the game play , which is excelent.The game is much improved from the first game which sometimes was slow and occasionally boring.Our fave part was the dualing in which we never wanted to leave the computer.Having said this some parts of the game were not so good. Ouiditch , was good to watch but that si because you do not do anything the computer moves for you, you just constanly hit the left mouse button.Overall it is a perfect and highlt enjoyable game."
5,Chamber of Secrets for the PC,"I found this game very entertaining. I reminded me of the nintendo game ""Legend of Zelda"" because you have different areas to go through and challenges to complete. It's not a difficult game so younger children would enjoy it without getting frustrated about not being able to get further into the game. I would highly recommend it to young (and old) kids."
4,I hate spiders!,"This game is really fun and challenging. You can skip cutscenes now (that's a big improvement. Now I don't have to watch any more 10 minute cutscenes!), and it's always fun to play Quidditch (The best part is kicking the other seeker). I am stuck at Aragog because whenever he runs up to Harry, all you can see in the screen is Aragog and for some reason it freaks me out and I have to put the game on pause. Also, this game always freezes on my computer which is really annoying, because I will be at a really important part and the game will randomly freeze."
5,Harry Potter Rules!,"This game is so wonderful. It is very addictive and I found myself playing for five hours straight when I got it. Then I came back later to play more! The graphics are much better than the previous game and the story flows better. Plus, the game is longer and you get to explore more of Hogwarts. (my fav part!)The Dueling and Quidditch are really fun and beautiful. If you haven't bought this game, you're nuts!"
4,Pros and Cons,"I purchased HP a couple days ago, expecting a game like last years. Boy, was I ever wrong.The graphics in this game are laughable, I can remember many times where Harry's wand was stuck to the outside of his hand, or sometimes when you could see Harry's leg sticking out the back of his robes.However, the gameplays is great, the Dueling Club is the best innovation I've ever seen made to a computer game, but the Quidditch is shockingly hard this time around.This game has enough secrets to keep even the smartest wizard baffled. If you like Harry Potter, this game is definently for you."
3,Fairly good...a bit tiring after a while,"I bought this and The Philosopher's Stone, and let me tell you that this is better than that. I enjoyed playing this quite a bit, but I found that it was good for a one-time use only, a bit like toilet paper.However I can assure you that in that one time you play it, you'll be greeted by numerous quests for potions, spells and other such knick-knacks. Good for a time-pass! I recommend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter and role-playing games."
5,So Much Fun!,Between my Mother and my daughters I can't get to my computer anymore. They are all Harry P. Fans and love the computer game.
3,S'okay,"Well, I thought this was a well-planned game, but I have to comment that it was easy to beat. I did not like the quidditch practices, cuz if you have finished all challenges, you can't go on to the next step/task/mission without beating it (quidditch practice and match). Those were the hardest parts of the game. The boss/serpent (mythologically basilisks were also known as the cocktrice and were not large snakes but were hatched from snake eggs under the proper constellation) was very easy, which I kinda liked since the 1st game's boss was much harder. I liked the bean challenge ideas, and all the new spells. All-in-all this game is better than the first and is more convient if you really don't have a ton of time to work on it."
5,The Chamber Of Fun!,This game is one of the best games I have ever played.>Every hidden corner can be explored.>Each spell is very creative.>The surroundings in the game are very well detailed.>It is more fun to collect wizard cards in this game than inany other because the cards unlock many secrets.From Arigog in the Forbidden Forest to the bascilisk in the Chamber Of Secrets this game is great fun. It is a must play!
2,Problem with game,"Although this game is fun for the whole family, it has some technical problems. I have had problems with EA Games, they don't seem to like to help with the game."
1,Not all video cards supported,"The game comes with a list of supported video cards printed on the box. When I found out my card was not supported, the manufacturer asked me to send them my opened copy of the game so they could send me a new shrink wrapped copy to send to Amazon in order to get a refund!"
1,Horror!!!,"Don't buy this game for PC. First of all the graphics are so bad you would think you play some 90's 3D game.If you have PS2, then buy it for PS2. The game really much better made, in terms of graphics and storyline. Well the only people who can really enjoy it is 12 and under year old kids."
5,Smart,"I have these stacked in my fridge and they are awesome. I put any produce that I can in there...celery, broccoli, carrots.. I can even put spring mix salad from a ""box"", and it keeps so much better. I also have a lettuce keeper that is great too. Everything stays fresher and crisper. If I have time, I wash and cut the produce before storing. And that way we can just grab something and go."
5,Holds heat well.,"My wife and I bought this to hold queso. We wanted something that was oven and microwave safe and also heavy enough to retain heat. This Le Creuset does all of that.Before we make our queso, we throw this in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes. Then we transfer the queso to this bowl and eat. It keeps things sizzling hot much longer than a standard bowl and it's nice to look at too."
3,"Beautiful, good cookware, but small","I guess I wasn't really paying attention, but when this dish arrived, it was much smaller than I expected. It's lovely, but I haven't really figured out what I can use it for. It would be good for a single serving for one person."
3,Informative,"Great book. Was used very effectively in our policy class. Information on past and present water laws, including the origins of water law were great to study. Interesting cases."
4,"If you love the Key of G, ...","It's a good collection of songs that'll keep me busy for a long time. The book is forthright in declaring that they've put a lot of the selections in the key of G and they do tell the reader essentially to feel free to take artistic license in the bluegrass tradition and move the tunes to whatever scale you like; however, as someone new to the genre and unfamiliar with how the songs would sound otherwise, I'd at least like to know what the original key was. For all of the content, the book is fairly thin and has a standard binding; that means it doesn't like to stay open or on my page. I find myself having to make copies of pages that I'm going to practice."
3,"Useful, but flawed","I bought this book because the bluegrass jamminng group I go to uses it. Generally, it is useful as a group tool for getting everyone on the same page, musically. It has a good assortment of standard bluegrass classics. My biggest criticisms of it include lack of instrument tabs, wrong chording in a couple of the songs, and lack of accurate historical citation on the music itself. For instance, the author credits ""will the Circle Be Unbroken"" to Alan Lomax, who only recorded the Carter Family performing it. It just seems to me the author didn't bother to to his homework very thoroughly."
1,Bluegrass fakebook,"I was very disappointed in this book. It has music annotation but; no tablature(How many bluegrass pickers read music?????). The pages are to busy and it's not well thought out. If had had seen one before I bought it, I sure would have spent my money on something worthwhile."
4,Great Presentation,"My experience was very different than Erik's. I felt the CD-ROM web presentation was super. Nothing complicated, no java or active code to go wrong. Quite straight forward in design and better than many of the corporate websites these days.I do agree that the authors really do know how to ski, just look at the videos. Many of the pieces of advice have me re-thinking how I approach the sport.Readers can not go too wrong at this price."
3,"Great content, but technically outdated","This would certainly have been a great product 10 years ago. Today it is simply outdated. I give it 3 stars because the content is excellent and very helpful. The text provides first-class advise on how to improve your skiing technique (both for classic and skating, but tilted towards skating). Different to many other sources the text is easy to understand and easy to follow. Even better are the video clips that are both amazing to watch and extremely helpful.However, I was quite disappointed by the poor resolution of the video clips. They are so small that I found myself touching the screen with the nose to see anything. Also, the material is not as well organized as one would expect from a web style presentation. The reader is forced to go through it in a linear fashion like for a book or a DVD without any cross referencing. Not even a Glossary (which would have been helpful to understand the Candian terms like 1-skate for V2 etc) is provided."
1,RCIA,I found this book to be way too basic as a catechist teaching RCIA. Not sure when I would use this book at all. I have reviewed hundreds of RCIA format which were much better. I would not recommend this book for a parish teaching.The format created by the Association for Catechumenal Ministry (ACM) and the RCIA Manual used in the Military which can be printed from the Web site http://www.milarch.org/policy/rcia_manual.html are actually the two best resources which I have found for teaching adults and at the prisons.
2,not worth it,"I purchased this for my 6 yr old daughter for christmas and now, 2 months later, it just sits in the corner. The hair does not curl like it says so not even close to being worth the money"
5,A Fascinating Lifestyle,I really enjoyed this book. The Cahuilla Indians led a fascinating existence living in the mountains and deserts of Southern California (near Palm Springs). The book describes the way that they adapted to their environment and live in the mountains in the summer and the desert in the winter. This is a very good educational book.
1,The Pillow Book of Lady Wisteria--Kindle version,"The Kindle version of this book is very disappointing simply because of frequent errors. Words have been spelled incorrectly, spacing between words is often left out and the reader is required to guess at words several times per page. I am annoyed that I spent money on this book and hesitant to buy more Kindle copies by this publisher. Amazon, I deserve a refund!"
2,A frustrating read,This book starts out as an interesting story but unfortunately the main plot is overcome by the many sub plots that appear.Clues to the main mystery appear infrequently while we read about various love stories and side storys whithin the characters lives. To be honest I eventually quit reading the book as I lost interest in the main story.The authors other books are very good so I still look forward to reading her future novels.
1,This lady wishes she could have used this book for a Pillow,Oh my gosh...I found this book just so boring and I tried for 50 pages to give it a chance.
1,Not really worth the time,"The stories were very dated and everyone fell in love within about a week of meeting, how tidy. The middle story was too short and I didn't even finish reading it, just skimmed, but it wasn't satisfying at all. The third story had potential, but again, with everything is perfect, happy endings all around, no real problems. I wouldn't recommend this title when there are more contemporary works available by Roberts that make for much better reading."
5,Island of Flowers worth the price for all three,"I love Nora's older stories an am partial to the straight love stories as opposed to the more mystery laden ones. Island of Flowers was so fresh and delightful. One of Robert's strong points (and she has many) is her ability to transport the reader to this ""place."" You feel the ocean breezes, smell the blossoms and live the romance as Laine discovers her own sexuality and vulnerability. Dillon is a macho guy and I loved the way he fell for innocent Laine and because of her became better man. I guess I am a pure romantic but this story was worth the price of the book. The other two stories are enjoyable but this one really spoke to me."
3,"Love the author, not one of my favorites","I have recently just begun to dive into the huge collection of Nora Roberts novels. The first book I read was Angel's Fall which I really enjoyed. I have to say that I was disappointed with this collection as a whole. I did not realize when I bought this book that two of the three stories were from her early career(1984 and 1987). The first story is Unfinished Business and of the three this was my favorite. It was written in 2000 and I think it flowed well and I enjoyed the characters and plot. It was a very fast read. The second story was Island of Flowers which took me awhile to get into. I thought it was very choppy and didn't particulary care for the characters at all. The third story was Mind Over Matter and this one was mediocre at best. Maybe it was the fact that I didn't really care to read a story on a clarvoyant mother and daughter. A quick recommendation, don't pick this as your first Nora Roberts book."
1,Only helpful to learn English - not to learn Thai!,"I'm an American trying to learn Thai and was excited to have this book to supplement my other books and CD's, but it is pretty much useless to me because each illustration is written in English and Thai alphabet - not written phonetically for the Thai word. So if you don't fully comprehend the Thai alphabet, then this book will have no value for you. It's sad because it would have been very easy for them to include the phonetic translation with every picture. Sorry."
3,&#65533;Rare&#65533; is the key word,"I was quite disappointed with this B-side collection. Unfortunately non of the songs stack up to their predecessors, i.e. Jack The Ripper, Cosmic Dancer, Know Very Well How I Got My Name etc. And the songs don't even come close to the Sunny EP. These are tracks that probably should have stayed rare as even as a Morrissey fan I don't find them aesthetically appealing."
1,Inappropriate for my 6 yr old,"I have found this book to be inappropriate for a 6 year old. We just read the devotional that tries to parallel the death of Christ by using a made-up story of a boy soldier who is whipped to death in place of other soldiers. Having a child die to explain Christ's sacrifice just seemed too extreme for me. I think Christ's sacrifice can stand alone and doesn't need this fictional horror written alongside it. In general I feel this book is not written for a 6 year old level. I just wanted to caution anyone using this book to preview it before reading it to your child, because you might be blindsided as I was."
4,It is what it is....,"This product is as good as it says it is. Don't expect major HP gains, or even a noticeable difference in throttle, but the fact is, you'll never have to buy another air filter again, and thats great!"
4,This CD Rocks!,"The song ""Everytime I Close My Eyes"" is an excellent mid-tempo song that is worth listening to!"
1,aj?,"my friends all love the backstreet boys so i figured i'd give them a chance and tried this cd. it's got to be a joke. aj has the funkiest, raspiest voice i've ever heard, and his style is so weird. he kind of freaks me out. maybe i'll try nsync instead, i might have better luck there."
1,Time is a precious commodity; this book isn't.,"This is the first book that I can remember returning to the library without finishing. I love to read historical fiction, not hysterical fiction. Portrays Ethan Allen as an infantile dolt. Skip this one, and save a few hours for something worthwhile, like picking lint from your belly-button and from between your toes."
2,Box leather is abit old,Got the box. abit too bulky. Watch slot cant fit 45mm watches where the leather strap buckle cannot fit into the slots. They could have made the box narrower or thiner. Also the packaging and leather condition don't look too new. For the price its acceptable.
5,A recommended pick for both general collections and in-depth military holdings,"World War II students interested in in-depth detail will relish Graphic War: The Secret Aviation Drawings And Illustrations Of World War II: it offers information which until recently was classified and filed away in archives from Britain and the US to Germany and the Soviet Union. Artists on all sides played a major part in the war, creating visual aids vital to pilot training and the aviation industry as a whole. Graphic War surveys artists, drawings, and how the face of the war was transformed because of their efforts. From color cut-away craft illustration to posters, schematics, charts, and other technical works, Graphic War surveys the total impact of graphic art drawings. A recommended pick for both general collections and in-depth military holdings."
5,Superb!!!,"It all makes sense now! My adoptive daughter was born in Korea, so our whole family has been trying to learn a little Korean. But believe me, it wasn't easy.However, this book's grammar and pronunciation sections did a great job of explaining things. The book is very well organized. I'd have to say it's the best such book on Korean I've seen.Somehow they have come up with just about every possible expression you might need, which means the only drawback to the book is that it's a little thick."
2,Too complicated,Don't bother getting this unless you want to learn how to speak Korean. If you just want a few simple phrases and how to say them look for something else.
1,Feel ripped off. Newer edition available for $4 used.,I wish I would have researched this more before buying because I was trusting I was getting a good deal. I paid about $22 after shipping before I realized the newer edition from 2008 is only $9 new and $4 used on here. When I looked at the US price on the back of this one when I got it said $7.99 US. I really feel ripped off. I guess I should know better and do more research in the future. Otherwise the book itself is great.
5,"Clear, current, concise!","This is the second dictionary/phrasebook I've orded and this one stands heads above the other. The background explanation of the writing system, language, and grammar are really helpful and the phrases used are current (not archaic like the other book I had). I'm really thrilled to have this in my hands--everything is falling into place now! I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in speaking Korean without formal instruction."
5,Supplier a solidly reliable company,"I live in Korea, and was going home for a few days, and wanted to pick up this phrase book with the little time I had. I knew if I purchased it through Better World Books I would get it when I needed it. Had it delivered to my son's, where I stayed for four days. Told BWB to have it delivered there, and that my window of time was short. Sure enough, when I got there, the book was waiting for me in excellent condition. I know I can count on BWB when I need a used book from Amazon. The book, of course, is what I really needed as I am trying to learn Korean."
5,Satisfied customer,This book was very useful. It is laid out well and has detailed information about what you needed to know to get around in Korea.
3,Not Really Scooped,"I like these shirts but they are more like crew neck than scoop. I like a modest scoop but this is a little too modest, almost nonexistent. I wish they were tagless, too. Still, I love the colors and the all cotton fabric. I'd love to see similar jerseys in long sleeves. Order up one-two sizes with Bella!"
2,Thought this would be an oil killer,"Bought to clean up excess oil when I lubricate my motorcycle chain. I used full strength, two times, and was very disappointed with the results. I then grabbed my bottle of Simple Green, which resulted in much better overall results. Not perfect but considerably better! My wife is a lot happier too, wasn't to happy with the oil stains on our driveway. (They are almost gone)"
5,Bernese Mt Dog Loves It,Sasha is 9. We used an inexpensive comb for years. The dog hates it and so did we. With this med/fine Oster rake we get through her coat in no time. Sasha even likes it. It cuts tangled lumps. Shedding in the house is 20% of what it was B4 Oster. Most highly recommended. Please take note of you dog's coat requirements. Short hairs need Fine or X-fine rakes while curly coats need a Coarse rake. The difference is the space between the tines.
2,Not worth the money,"I have seven cats, none long haired...I'd call them medium haired, tabbys. This is so not worth the money. It won't go through my cats hair and removes the minimal (and I'm being generous) amount from them. I have one cat who's hair is so baby fine that not even a brush will have any hair on it when I brush him and this removed some from him...not a lot. I have a Whisker City that I paid less than $5.00 for and it works a thousand percent better than this. Save your money unless your cats hair is finer than a 6 month old human baby's hair."
2,Get the Furminator,"I have beagles. This thing does nothing to remove fur, maybe I got the wrong one. The furminator at least gets the hair just I just hate how the dogs don't like it. almost like it hurts them."
3,Too small for big dogs.,"I purchased this because I was looking for an all metal rake style comb for my Aussie Shepherd and Shilo Shepherd.I have busted a number of the plastic handle rake combs,and figured the Oster looked rugged enough not to break. The pictures make this comb look much bigger than it actually is. The full width of the working comb head is only 1.5"" wide! The teeth have an effective depth of 1/4"". It is almost useless to comb out my two dogs with this toothbrush size unit. If it were twice as wide and the teeth were twice as long,it would be much more usefull."
3,"OK, There is still some good fun in it","Well, I'm sure that pretty much all Medal of Honor fans would find some fun in the levels. Some of the levels were very fun while some were downright irritating. It is only ten bucks and I think that for ten bucks it is a good buy, but I definitely wouldn't buy it if it was like $35. I do like some of the new guns quite a bit, and the models are more fun to shoot. There definitely was some fun parts.PROs Improved AI, Better Graphics, Fun Guns, Interesting levels, Currently CheapCONs Requires a lot of video power, some irritating as heck sniper levels, boring half track level, short, couple of confusing levels, and too shortGood, but for the same price Breakthrough is a better buy"
3,Just doesn't live up,"The expansion pack just doesn't live up to the origninal. The first level as your parachute in is the most intense moment in the entire expansion and its the first level!... The original is still one of the best fps's to date and one of the best things it did is start out slow so you had stuff to look forward to, after that first level in the expansion it just goes downhill. Is it worth its price? if your a huge fan of the original it is, even though it can be beaten in a few hours if you play it through. I also might add the multiplayer is extremely fun, and adds alot to the original. THe price is still a little steep for its length."
3,Wheres the originality?,"The game is fabulous, but where's the originality? It's basically just some new weapons, levels, and other things. The full version has some bugs which are sometimes intolerable, and they removed half of all the skins in MP mode!I would suggest buying the next MOH game in 2003. I'm sure that will be a great enhancement."
1,Save your money,"This game has more problems than I care to discuss. I have been a moderate game player for years, and never have I had more lock-ups, crashes and poor game play than I have had with this game. And, EA's site is a joke.Buy a program from another company that actually works, and you don't have to screw around with just to start the program!"
4,Excellent,"Good mindless fun.Online battles excellent. Game could have used some better controls to cut down on some of the obvious cheats (fiddling with gun accuracy, bunny hopping, slowed networks) but still a good time."
1,not compatible,"Medal of Honor - Allied Assault works fine on my computer, but Spearhead doesn't run. Some sort of OpenGL compatibility problem.I have a Geforce 2 MX video card. Electronic Arts is no help at all in resolving this problem. If I could return the game, I would."
2,"Good graphics, poor gameplay","I bought Spearhead as soon as I could. I should have waited. I don't do a lot of multiplayer (high-speed net access is unavailable) so I really wanted to play the singleplayer missions. I finished them in one weekend. I know, it's an expansion pack, but I hoped it would have ""expanded"" the MOH playing experience. It didn't. Spearhead is basically a sequel, not an expansion like Clone Wars was for Galatic Battlegrounds or all the Sims expansions. Too bad."
3,Spearhead - A Let Down,"With much anticipation after playing MOHAA, I purchased Spearhead as soon as it was available. I was disappointed with it in that it wasn't up to the standards of the original. Some of the battles are overly easy and others are overly difficult. There doesn't seem to be any consistency with the difficulty levels. I must say it was a let down after playing the original."
2,"Nice, but WAY too short!","This expansion falls far short of the great game Medal of Honor. The missions are far too linear. The biggest gripe by far though is that there are only 9 new missions. That wouldn't be so bad, but these missions are extremely short compared to the originals in MoH. The graphics get a boost, but that doesn't make up for the glaring lack of content. I am extremely disappointed. What a let down! Save your cash and wait a couple months and pick this title up out of the bargin bin..."
2,Just a note to those who enjoy darkness,"Basically, this is just a comment made after playing a bit of the opening Normandy sequence, and perhaps it is unfair for the game as a whole. But the opening sequences of this game are basically played in the dark, and if you really think this is an enjoyable game in spite of this, you are welcome to spend your money (but close the curtains and turn up your screen brightness or you won't see ANYTHING for quite some time). Be aware that ""computer dark"" is not ""real dark,"" where your other senses play an important role). I have found this quite irritating and not much fun so far, though the game is so predictable after a try or two that it would be hard to fail. It's unrealism carried to the tenth degree in the name of realism. Boring."
5,EXPANSION PACK,"For all the people that say that this is alot shorter than the original game it is because it is an EXPANSION PACK. No expansion packs are as big as the original for these games we like to call them sequels. For example Big Game Hunter 3 has an expansion pack just adding a couple guns and a couple new levels, but when you make a new game in this case Big Game Hunter 4 will be the only time you see the game close to the size of the original game. So sumerized this means in size wise expansion packs can be expected to be small, if you want a full size game wait for the sequel. I've never played the game so ignore my rating."
2,...,...I finihed the first (short) mission on medium difficulty in about 2 hours of interupted gameplay.I'm about to finish the 3rd mission after much same old same old gameplay...Great graphics and sometimes spotty gameplay.I loved the sticky bombs and some of the new weapons but they could have added at least two more campaigns...
4,Great! (but short),"This is a fantastic add-on to the original - better graphics and sound effects. Being a military historian specializing in this theater of operations, it is accurate and the sounds effects are superb! EA Still has some challenges with the graphic renderings of the people, but that is really minor compared to the play-abilty of this add-on! The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is that I would recommend waiting until this got to a [lower] price as it is much shorter than I had anticipated and does not add too much more to the original outside of several more missions/new weapons etc... Still, I recommend buying this if you liked the first. I am also watching EA's website to see if EA is planning to add more to this line - like the Italian theater of operations and perhaps the abilty to choose which side to play on - Axis or Allied... They should release a soundtrack CD to this series - the music is that good!"
5,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"I love this single. Can you tell?From the unbelievably gorgeous, star-dabbled STORM IN HEAVEN LP enters the swirled-up, detailed rock of ""Slide Away"" in its original form. The lyrics, music, and singing are all to die for. Next are the acoustic versions of ""Make It 'Til Monday"" and ""Virtual World"" in raw, strummed-out form... oh, ""Virtual World"" is even more haunting than the original. What can I say? I'm speechless, I love it all ... I'm so overcome with emotion I can't even articulate ... GASP ........ someone ... get me a drink of water ..... GURRRRP ... ))ähhhhh((Dear reader, this is *atleast* as good as anything radiohead has ever put out. I also strongly recommend The Verve's ""Blue"" single with the lovely, folk nonalbum tracks. It's just all so BEAUTIFUL and REAL ... !!!!!!!!!Now that you've bought it: forget everything I've written, put it on with no expectations, and be blown away..."
5,Keeps fruits and veggies fresh,"I purchased the small FridgeSmart medium and the small for use in our kitchen. We frequently buy items in bulk and need to wash and keep separate. The small container is perfect for grapes, lemons and other fruit. It is also ideal for oranges and brocolli crowns. This container when set properly will keep your fresh food fresh. It is also easy to clean. The only drawback was that the lid is somewhat difficult to apply. I also wish it had the valve settings like the medium one does. Overall, this container helps me in the kitchen."
1,It seemed like such a good idea...,"For basic storage, I usually use Pyrex or Rubbermaid. But for the truly innovate stuff, Tupperware rules. So, I was really happy to find this, and looking forward to storing my ginger and galangal root in the fridge, and having it stay fresh.The box sucks. The lid is stiff and doesn't fit very well (it's not made from HDPE like most Tupperware lids). The vent holes aren't big enough to let out moisture, which condenses on the sides and runs back onto the food. The ribs on the bottom are shallow and wide, which is probably great for washing the box, but my ginger, kumquats, pear tomatoes, etc fall right between them, right into the water that has collected. Mold city.The little booklet that came with the box tells you how much venting various kinds of produce needs, so you can open one hole, or two, or none. I kept the booklet, bought some Rubbermaid serve-n-saver boxes and punched some holes in them, and am using the Tupperware box for recipe cards."
1,Not as pictured,"I have a larger FridgeSmart that I have used for years and absolutely love. I ordered this one to supplement that one. What I got instead of the blue one with the clear lid was the clear box with the yellow lid. The lid is stiff and hard to use. Sometimes it can be challenging to get the lid off. I've even spilled the entire contects of the box trying to get it off. I'm not sure if Tupperware changed the product - but fair warning... you won't be getting the one you think by reading the description and looking at the photo. The box still works keeping items fresher longer but I'm disappointed in this product and wouldn't buy another one. It's also pricey for the size. Although it is true to the measurements listed 6x6 - all the other products listed online as ""medium"" are larger. This was smaller than expected."
4,It's a cartoon!,"I was a little surprised to see it was a cartoon (apparently the whole ""Greatest Adventure Stories"" series are cartoons). As a cartoon, it takes liberties with the story, but sticks pretty close to the bible stories. Entertaining, but not exactly what I was looking for."
4,Really entertaining!,This book was great! The characters were very real and the love interests in the story were very convincing as well. Rowe is a great writer and I can't wait to check out her other books!
1,The Art of Dimensional Embroidery Book,"""The Art of Dimensional Embroidery"" by: Maria A. FreitasI have viewed this book in the needlecraft store where I go to for shopping. Every page was a colored picture. I was so happy to finally find a book that I could use so easily. The Pictures were so wonderful, with easy to understand instructions. When I received the book it was only Black and white. I sent it back, very disappointed. I would have paid more for the right book with colored pictures."
3,Buyer Beware - Amazon not an Authorized Dealer,"I found this product very adequate and Amazon's transaction as good as can be expected (A+) ""HOWEVER"".I've been having problems with this bar staying on the wall base clip. It appears that there is a little flaw in the casting where the V-groove is not deep enough on one of the bases. I belive that I can grind it out with a dremel but wished to contact Moen for warrenty info 1st.Here's where the rub comes. I contacted Moen a couple months ago via Email with no response. We finally called them this week only to find out that Amazon.com is not an ""authorized"" dealer so there is no warrenty. I guess that I'm going to hope that that I can repair the base and not have to purchase another from an authorized dealer - so much for the savings!!"
1,not complete,"this item came with two exactly the same mounting brackets and not one for each side. need to return, but do not know how?"
3,"Parts missing, returned.....","I didnt get a chance to see it, as the person putting it up, found missing pieces. Was returned. Nothing against the item, just an unfortunate part missing."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I remodeled the kids bathroom (3 boys) so I needed a double towel bar to keep the bathroom organized, and this product was the perfect complement for the finished bathroom, super easy to install. I would definitely recommend it"
2,Not Fun to install,Use your own anchors! The bars are not attatched to the brackets & after 3 trys we got it to stay on our wall. Otherwise it looks good.
4,Herbal Review,"I consider this to be a great book, especially for people who do not have a huge background in herbs. This book is almost completely remedies on an alphabetical basis. In the last few chapters of the book, herbal preparations and applications are given."
5,Great rake for hair mats in Labradoodle,This rake worked great in getting out the many fur mats in our Labradoodle.Would recommend it.
2,Pulls to much,Hard to handle when you run into a knot. Does to much pulling so the dog doesn't seem to like it.
2,Oster,I am not very happy with this product. It does not remove hair from my Siberian husky like I had hoped. So I bought the fur intro and it is the best.
4,"supremely functional, mechanically shaky","After having been raked with this marvelous undercoat rake, my golden retriever looks a lot better. She looks better, feels better, and obviously enjoys the experience. Or is it the dog bone she gets after? The Oster undercoat rake really took out a lot of hair, including some nasty looking tail hair.They ought to include a hex wrench that will fit the handle, though. It loosens easily and is positioned so I can't get at it with a standard hex wrench. IKEA hands out hex allen wrenches with their furniture, Oster should do the same with their rakes. Also, the teeth loosen independently and get out of line. I can see that it would be easy to take this apart for cleaning (if necessary?) but it feels a little bit like it will fall apart in the meantime."
5,great product,I have several long hair cats. This grooming rake is excellent. This removes hairballs with minimal or no discomfort for the cat.
2,Coarse Rake,This item does well. I noticed that a previous reviewer had stated that she was surprised at the quality of this item. I did not see any others commenting about that and was truly hoping that maybe her item had been the odd ones that turn up now and again in processing. Well folks not the story mine appeared to have the same problem. It's not like this is a low cost freeby either. I was disappointed that I would have to repair this item before using. I have several Oster items that I have not had a problem with until this one. Once repaired the rake does a good job but if not repaired it could create a problem possibly scraping the dogs skin which could lead to other problems. I would not recommend this product unless it is repaired and worked properly.
4,Probably the best you can find outside of a professional groomers tool-bag.,"I own a Blue Healer and a Yellow Lab, both of which spend time indoors and out, and both of which shed incessantly. The rigid undercoat rakes that you customarily find in the pet section of your local franchise shopping center worked in a sense, but I could tell that my dogs didn't enjoy it one bit and could see how it would agitate their skin. This rake allowes me to go AGAINST the hair direction, pulling massive amounts of undercoat off, and what's more, they love it!While I didn't confirm on whether you're supposed to go against the growth direction or not, I can say that if you have a medium/longhaired dog, be warned: brush them down, OUTSIDE! First time use, I was amazed...nay...shocked about how much of their undercoat was removed. Their coats looked much shinnier, and they looked a great deal cooler afterward, not to mention thinner!"
5,Excellent Grooming Tool,I was challenged with getting my rough haired Saint Bernard groomed of her heavy under coat...This tool was the remedy...She not only is great-she looks great....
5,Even works well for short haired dogs,"I have a short haired dog so was very skeptical about getting this, but even with a short hair dog we had shedding issues. This product removed handfuls of fur every brushing session. I have noticed much less hair around the house and his fur is so much softer. I would recommend this for even short hair dog owners."
4,18 teeth Grooming Rake,Does a great job of removing the dead undercoat hairs on long haired dogs. Can be used on long haired cats too. Animals enjoy it.
5,Works Like a Charm On My Border Collies,"My two little maniacs, as I call them, are getting ready to hit shedding season. I was very close to getting a Furminator, but read how it can cause irritation. I got this instead. Holy guacamole, on the first pass I removed enough fur to knit a sweater and my dogs love it. I think it's a must for anyone with a big furry dog."
3,Good info but no real secrets,"The information provided in these DVD's was very motivating and gave me some good ideas. My only problem with it is that they didn't give out much more information than what was on the free info-mercial on PBS. I was hoping to find out the actualy steps but it's not there, just the train of thought."
2,Didn't learn much,"I agree with the person that said it lacked details. You come away knowing that you're supposed to acquire assets while reducing your liabilities, and eventually somehow begin and sell corporations for profit. The author didn't explain how an ordinary person goes about this process...mostly it seemed like him bragging that he was able to do it.What I take away from this audio-CD could probably have been reduced down to 4 tracks on 1 disc. Sad, but true."
3,"Very nice product, but why is it so expensive? Found finely ground rice flour","elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. (Finer than Bob's Red Mill.) Search the net before buying, or have a bottomless wallet to buy this product! At this price, this product should at least be organic, which its not."
5,a must have gluten-free pantry staple,I use this flour exclusively for my flour blends that call for brown rice flour. Superfine is a true adjective for this product. It makes all of my baked goods indistinguishable from their wheat counterparts.
5,Great stuff!,"I read about this in ""Gluten-Free Baking Classics"" by Annelise Roberts, so I ordered some. What a difference! Love it! No grittiness in my GF baked goods. Thanks!"
4,nice little book,"This is a ""little"" book that takes a hold of you in a ""big"" wayIt keeps you reading, I was disappointed when it was over."
4,Great work but chronology is challenging,"I am grateful for this tremendously informative and inspiring work. As I apply Doriot's biography to my own research, however, I do find Mr. Gupta's chronology of Doriot's life and work to be somewhat challenging to follow."
2,Don't know about this stuff,"I have been using this product for about 3-4 weeks. My nails are thin and peel but also brittle and often snap off when bumped. I have 2 nails that have a split line in them. As soon as they grow out past the end of my finger, the split portion rips back down to nail line. So far I have not noticed any change. Almost all of my nails look like I keep them cut down to the quick. I am hoping that as they grow out this time they will be stronger and that I will eventually grow out the 2 nails with the split in them and resolve that problem. This is an ongoing problem and I am hoping that with time this product will work. At least it is reasonably priced so I can afford to wait and see if things improve."
3,Children's Mass Book,I should have looked at the dimensions of this book. It is very small and hard to hold open.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,Although I like the butter compartment and it is an awsome idea.The salt and pepper sides do not stay closed.One side might on either peice but I have not seen a set that is not defective.This product does not do the Tupperware name any justice.
5,GREAT!,"As a devotee of gypsy violin music, I highly recommend Oleg Ponomarev's CD, ""Master of the Russian Gypsy Violin"". I sincerely hope that he will produce another ""gypsy violin"" CD soon.soon."
4,Really wonderful!,"I ordered this CD while seeking some good gypsy violin music. The reviews were right! This is a terrific CD that captures the spirit of Russian Gypsy violin beautiful. The joy, the pathos! Our department at work has decided on a Halloween theme of a gypsy encampment, and this CD will be playing all day long."
5,the coolest italian rock'n'roll band,"The Space Surfers are sugar rush fast, power pop, surf, punksters, from ITALY. Using their ripping chunky power chords they plow thru some cool songs. Their lead singer Sofia Castelli tears thru her vocals while the boys Giovanni Volpe and Michele Zorloni add gang power into the mix. They remind me of Whale whose Hobo Humpin was a hit a few years back. They use vocal snippets to augment the songs usualy on the intros. Singing about everything from dinosaurs and gorrillas to killer surfers from outer space you certainly don't have to worry about your head being brought down with heavy messages. Toward the end of the record they head into a more funky punk sound. Cramming 14 songs into 31 minutes and keeping it funny, fast, fun and a bit eclectic the whole way. Its a Gin fueled sweet sixteen party from Quentin Tarantino"
5,supersensacional,he is a once- in- a- life- time attribute to the ballads of a love that brings joy to each love affair that only true love has shown. truly a super marksman of singing from the very soul of a heart. he writes the songs that every lover has experienced.a true gentleman with class for the arts of lovers music.
2,"Where's ""...for dummies"" in the title?","I will be brief.I only have 4.5 years experience as a programmer, of those only 1.5 were spent on C++ and I have no experience whatsoever in game programming;the new stuff I learned from this book could be printed on a letter page or less.This is just generic, and rather primitive, data structures and algorithms book, that applies them to making a small game instead of usual example search/whatever programs. Sometimes it feels like a data structure was used merely as an example that fit in that place in grand example-place matching, and not as the most useful or efficient one...One could probably turn it into ""Data Structures for Database Server Programmers"", ""Data Structures For Embedded Device Programmers"", or ""Data Structures For Solving World Hunger"" with copy/paste and minor grammatical corrections ;)"
5,Excepcional,"Jeanette es simplemente de lo mejor, con exitos romanticos que nunca pasan de moda en el corazon, conquistando los sentimientos de todos los que sabemos amar.... y de los que no sabemos tambien"
1,This printing is worthless,"Do not buy this book in printed form. The printing is not complete. Formulas have missing parts. Fractions appears as just lines, with no numerators or denominators. I was very disappointed because it looks like it would be a good reference if the text had printed properly. But half a formula is worthless. Maybe in electronic form this book would be okay, but definitely not in printed form."
3,What a waste !!!!,"The lighting ruined this beautiful opera! Throughout the whole performance, the scenes were immersed in hellish darkness. The net results are disgustingly unfair to the singers and choreographers. How can La Scala permit this unprofessional shortcoming to happen?I love Devia's performance, as well as her earlier dvd. La Scola was in too much of a hurry to finish the final scene, losing critical impact provided by Donizetti. He could learn from Carreras."
3,A Barely Adequate Lucia,"This is an opera I know very well. To be frank, I got 1/3 through this recording and it's been on the shelf ever since. Not impressed by the singers. Orchestra OK.Regards, Dick Doucet"
5,Self learner,"From personal experience, any textbook by Dr.Cengel deserves recognition, for it is not only easy to understand, but also provides the required preparation to succeed as an engineer."
2,Not a substitute for proper training,"I bought this just so I could review it and know what to recommend to my clients. I do love the system itself, but not this accessory. It won't do anything to discourage a puller and I can't see that it will do anything to relieve the constant shock of a dog tightening up on the leash. Good training will do more good for you and your dog. Buy the system, but leave this accessory off the list."
4,Buddy systems,Really helps walking multiple dogs at one time. Especially if young energetic large dog. Good product. Would like a little longer
2,I actually like the leash concept loads and was excited to recieve it,"The ""belt"" portion of the leash was thinner than I expected and I was hoping for more attachement options as I had 3 dogs at the time of ordering. I really lkied the lunge buster attachement BUT I did not want it long...it would have been much too long with the other components. There was no way to connect lunge buster alone to the collar of your dog...thus I returned the entire system."
2,Buy another book by SAMS,"I ended up buying this book for Redhat 7.1 because it was quicker than buying from Redhat directly and the same store was till carrying RH 6.2!! However, this book was too vague on most of the more advanced topics that I ended up spending hours reading the ""man"" pages to figure things out.Example, this book is for Linux 7, but it discussed inetd rather that xinetd that comes with RH Linux 7. I also kept going to the store to look at the new book by SAMS by Bill Ball on Redhat 7 Unleased (many other versions out there).Bottom line, buy the latest Redhat distribution from the company, lets help them out to survive against the Seattle Giant, and buy a book focused purely on Redhat rather than generic Linux.The book by same company Hungry Minds on RH Linux is good but not as good as SAMS publishing."
1,Waste of my money,"This book was a huge dissappointment! I understand why I wasn't given an option of reviewing it before purchasing. It is created by amateur interpreters for the same kind. I am sorry, but I know what 'parking permit' or 'prostitution' are. However, I couldn't find such simple and common legal concepts such as 'peace order', pro se, peremptory challenge, 'on merits', and a bunch of other very common legal terms. It looks like the authors chose to translate the simplest legal terms rather than work a bit harder. The book is also full of typos and spelling mistakes. Do not buy this book!"
5,Great Benefit to Law Enforcement Officers and Investigators,"""English-Russian Dictionary of American Criminal Law should be of great benefit to law enforcement officers and criminal investigators in their interactions with the Russian speaking community in the United States. It is critical to our work with Russian crime victims, witnesses and suspects that we have resources to assist us in accurately translating written communications. This Dictionary provides us an excellent reference for interacting with the Russian speaking community."
5,Cosmic Gate puts it down unlike any others,Cosmic Gate's style of house music is unrivaled; perfectly blending a hint of trance with sick house beats. All of the remixes on this single make it a worthy buy. Cosmic Gate never seems to amaze me.Beautiful.
1,"Good yarn, wretchedly told","The mutiny on the American whaleship Globe, the subsequent attempt by the plotter Samuel Comstock to set up as an island king and the successful counterrevolution by some of the young crew deserves a thoughtful retelling.Edwin Hoyt, one of the most prolific hacks writing about events in the Pacific, is not the man to do it.This error-filled recreation -- it does not deserve the name history -- was first published in 1975, and the story itself is of sufficient interest to have kept 'Mutiny on the Globe' in print. But Hoyt has not bothered to correct the numerous embarrassing errors. To give just one example: He has the Globe sheltering in Pearl Harbor during a stop in Hawaii. Pearl Harbor was not used for ships until late in the 19th century."
4,Inspired and Inspiring,"Written 75 years ago or so, and based on the transcripts of a radio program, the Spiritual Life is a very short and concise examination of what it takes to lead a spiritual life - not for the monastic - but for and in the day to day elements of ordinary existence. Her premise is that the spiritual life is lead through communion and cooperation with God - at all times. The components of that communion include presence and prayer, and the cooperation is allowing spirituality to pervade all action and to see all action as holy action. An inspiring little book."
2,Good & Difficult,"This is an interesting book, but her writing style is very difficult to read. I would recommend finding a book written by a current author. This is a classic book, but I really grew tired of the writtng style."
2,Big Price Small Book...,"I was asked to read this book in Seminary. I must say I was a little shocked at the price versus the content. Evelyn Underhill is a mystic. Her views, concepts and theology have an incredible amount of mystery coupled with her own life experience. It's a very easy read, and found it to be a new way to explore the question, ""What is the Spiritual Life?"" I would not reccomend this book for someone who is just coming to faith, or is looking for a practical way to understand the Spirit...too much mysticism to wade through."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Jose Alfredo Jimenez, but I found this album not as good as others I own. I bought it because it has 'La Bola Negra,' one of my favorites from an old LP I used to have. Most of the songs on this album are available on other better produced albums. I think my major disappointment is the musical group backing up Jose Alfredo; they just don't sound as professional as I'd like."
3,Bright but otherwise average,"The 3100 brightness is nice, but the projector has a weak zoom requiring the projector to be fairly close to the screen. This projector also has a noticeable screen-door effect common with LCD projectors."
2,Just okay,"I bought this shampoo believing the hype that my hair would be thicker and possibly even start growing back. That didn't happen. In fact, when combined with the conditioner, which doesn't condition at all, my hair became harder to comb and so more hair actually fell out. It does have a nice scent, but I don't think that it cleaned my hair very well, as my hair felt quite oily."
2,bumps,"Since using nutri-ox shampooand conditioner itchy bumps have appeared all over my scalp, a problem I have never had before!"
5,Amazing...very simply...amazing,"These two have interpreted Bach using an almost completely unknown instrument and have create a listen experience that for me, never fails to completely engross me. It is refreshing to know, that even under the radar, there are musicians dedicated to an artform that yields such emotions.Well done Peter and Peter."
4,"Great Music, Poor Packaging","The music is, of course, supreme and impeccably played, and the sound engineering perfect--a significant addition to my collection.The package, however, was damaged in transit and the CD case was destroyed. Fortunately, the disc was not damaged. The corrugated cardboard sleeves that many vendors use for shipping CDs and DVDs are simply not adequate protection."
5,monroe 37074,my husband installed it for me and he said he like it it 's very strong and working good on the raod.
3,Okay,"They were good right off the bat but now, it's getting spongie. KYB's were going so I opted for these"
3,A good book despite errors and omitions.,"This book contains a good deal of information, but it is poorly organized and edited. There is a large amount of typographical errors and some of the specs are not even listed. For example, one of the cameras had its strap lug type listed while another did not. The author did not list the dimentions of the cameras, nor the weight of the cameras(grams, ounces, drams, no weight measurement). Finally, and most importantly, he doesn't tell a story with any of these cameras. Yes, there is alot of pictures of these rare beauties, but its boring. Its hard to believet that in his reaserch that the people involved in their development did not tell him any funny anecdotes. Its boring and a shame."
5,A great reference for anyone interested in Leicas,"This book is invaluable at camera shows, garage and estate sales, and when traveling. It has just about all the information you need to identify a Leica by appearance and serial number. The author also includes grades so you can determine the rarity of a camera. The sections on special issue and military Leicas are especially interesting.Combine this book with the Leica Price Guide and you can't lose!"
2,Good ideas but can you trust the author?,"Barnes does have some interesting ideas, but if you have Tradestation or similar, test everything! I found one system badly fudged -- it looks good only if you use the exact data used in the test. Go earlier or later and the system looks pretty bad. I am suspicious and in any case if you have to go over everything in a book to verify it, it's too much work."
1,46 to 54 win to loss in silver...a coin flip could do better,"Odds like Robert is quoting for this trade method, I could do better flipping a coin. You can too. Go ahead try flipping a coin 100 times, see whate the results are. Better yet, if you have a computer, excell, lotus, or whatever spreadsheet, use the randomn number generator."
3,"super mess, part 2","Jessie, the world's oldest fledgling superhero, is back! Now she is in control of her powers (sort of), and is happy with her boyfriend, Seth. Her 16th birthday is coming up, and she is psyched. Then she finds out she has to get braces- and her dentist is an evil freak. Seth gets inferiority complex from having a girlfriend who can lift his car over her head. Jessie freaks while learning to drive, and breaks the car! She sends her teacher into early retirement, gets publicly humiliated by her mom, manages to dye her hair orange, and she still has to prepare herself for the superhero trials, or she might get taken away from her family! Can Jessie survive the super stress?"
5,Perfect Christmas Gift,"This was so amazing and wonderful. I bought this item for my wife for Christmas and when I opened it to wrap it for the holidays I could believe the craftsman ship. This is far one of the best things I could of ordered off of Amazon.Being a soldier downrange in Afghanistan I was very much afraid to order stuff on line after receiving this gift I will definitely purchase items from these people again.You just made me the luckiest guy on the planet with this item.Thanks for supporting us in Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom.Thanks for everything.SSG Grabowski, RobertFob Griffin, Afghanistan"
5,I use citric acid to clean my dishwasher of hard water deposits,I live in an area where there is hard water. I use citric acid to clean out the hard water deposits in my dishwasher. This was one of the cheapest resources for citric acid that I could find. It should last me two years or more.
5,"Classic Mexican dances by ""El Mejor Mariachi del Mundo""","This classic late 1960's album by the most important Mariachi ensemble features their remarkable performances of the famous ""Jarabe Tapatio"" (hat dance) and a furious arrangement of the popular ""La Bamba"" that shows great respect for the original *Son Jarrocho* from Vera Cruz. This CD will make you want to stomp out a *zapateado.* Indespensible for all Mariachi fans."
2,Not Particularly Impressed,The music is okay but the recording studio was poor. The current generation of vargas musicians is much better prepared from a technical & world exposure perspective.
2,"Professional, But Lacking","This movie was highly produced. A lot of time was put into the photography and the soundtrack. The acting was also quite acceptable. The problem is that the writers/director hit you over the head with the message of the film. They go to great lengths to portray stereotypical characters and predictable events which make it impossible for anyone to miss their intended message. While imparting the message of racial tolerance is laudible, it should be done with a little more subtlety (even if this is a movie aimed at an under ten-year-old audience). This movie is a perfect example of a mediocre story which has been raised beyond its potential through heroic efforts in its production.The other major flaw of this movie is the way it ends. It seems that another ten minutes was added to the end of the movie just to provide sufficient length. Cutting it off a bit sooner would have been an improvement... also leaving out the horrendous song at the end would have been a great idea!"
2,If Doom sucked you would get Immercenary,This is a doom type game that is a bit weird. although they do show women without tops on. The game is void of any real substance.
3,Another large NAPLEX review,"This is another large review book for the NAPLEX. The book may be too detailed to read from cover to cover in time for the exam, but it came free with APhA membership during our final year in pharmacy school. I used this APHA book and the Comprehensive Review of Pharmacy (Shargel) to obtain background information on topics that kept eluding me during practice exams with Appleton & Lange.Be careful when reading the APhA book since it had some errors in the drug information tables from the last edition, particularly in the GI chapter. I don't know if they have been corrected in the new edition."
3,Make Sure You Receive The Correct Item,"I ordered this item (with the flashing red light) for my Father In-Law's vacation home. I did not receive the model I ordered, I ended up with an audible version instead of the one with the flashing red light. The audible version transmits up to 120' away to a receiver. The company I ordered it from (Northern Tool) was exceptional in their customer service and credited me the full cost of the item. I would again buy from Northern Tool."
2,DISTANCE SIGNAL TRAVELS,THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT TELL YOU THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE FROM SENSOR TO RECIVER CAN BE.
2,"Overpriced, too much work!","$35 minus the TUPPERWARE brand name = $3There is absolutely no reason this piece of plastic should be priced @ $35!I gave it 2 stars only because the quality is good.However, there are SEVERAL non-stick aluminum, spring-loaded presses on the market that cost around $20!They are MUCH less work and handle a much larger volume of ground beef. Shop around, don't pay for a name!"
2,not really worth it,"All of the parts are a little flimsy, you need 4 hands to really get this right. The meat starts to squeeze out between the press and the sides and when you are done pressing it sticks to the press. I was able to make it work, but it is really not worth the trouble, I would not buy it again."
3,Makes small burgers,"This item makes rather small burgers after being cooked. They'd be perfect for a small bun, if there were no meat shrinkage. Thinner, but wider would be better."
3,NOT BOLD 'N' BLUE Color,"I just received my order yesterday. The product comes in the current tupperware color of blue. It is not Bold 'n' blue - which has been discontinued by tupperware. I ordered this from this seller because I have a cabinet full of Bold 'n' Blue and I wanted some additional pieces to match. I am soooo disapointed with the wrong color. I will not use these pieces. The first picture on this listing is the correct color you will receive. The other two pictures are of the bold n blue color. I should have questioned why the wrong picture was posted with this add.By the way, I LOVE using tupperwares modular mates! But I do not want a mix of colors in my cabinet."
1,I have sent this back. It did not work out,I t did not work. I tried 10 times on the internet but the the site would not let me put the information in the item
2,Unhappy Customer!!,"I was happy to receive them before Christmas, but very disappointed after plugging it into my computer. The information template on the jump drive is very plain. Doesn't have an area for family history, hospitalizations and only has room for 1 insurance. I could have bought a jump drive cheaper and made a better template that this and it is a very flimsy, cheap jump drive!!! Very unhappy with this product and don't know if I can return it now that I have information in it!! Bought total of 3, one for me and one for my mom and dad!!!"
4,"MedicTag, Just what I needed","Carrying a USB medic alert is a perfect way to convey all of your medical history when you are unable to do it yourself. MedicTag is just right for those (like me) who have more than one medical condition. Most of the USB medical devices require a yearly subscription. A USB identifier that has a subscription is useless if the company that you get the subscription from goes out of business, which in the present is a probability. Another plus, for me, is the fact that you don't have to wear it as a bracelet. You can wear it around your neck or put it on your keychain, which is what I did. What I found was that it is cheaper thru Amazon than it is directly from the manufacturer.MedicTag Digital USB Personal Medical Alert Device"
2,Eh,"I bought this book simply because my little girl's name is Ellie. The story is kind of a clunker, and there is an actual picture (not drawing) of elephant feces on one of the pages. Yeah. My daughter thinks it's hysterical though, so I guess that's what the author was trying to go for."
4,"Original, promising approach to psychology of achievement","Kirchman makes some pretty heavy claims, but by and large, the book lives up to them.Aspirations is not an easy read, but it's well worth the effort. The author outlines, among other things, an empirical basis for psychology, how popular psychology is an emerging science of ethics, and how our qualities of character have a neurological basis.Apparently, his theory of deduction is being applied in a software company he is involved with.Overall, this book is innovative and is a must read for someone looking for answers and self-understanding."
5,Frodo,"This toy is a great edition to your LOTR collection, it looks exactly like Elija Wood! Only, if you plan to display him with the cape on, he wont stand, no matter HOW hard you try! he absolutely doesn't stand with the cape. and stragely he is about a half inch taller than any of the other Hobbits, but when they are together, you can barely notice. and the cool thing about him is the way his sword lights up, the blue is so pretty and if you light it up in a pitch black room, it pratically lights up the whole room! and it is so much fun to play with. so i hope that this review was helpful to you ;)"
3,I don't like it.,"I bought this (as usual) from a store, but I haven't even taken him out of the box yet. I'm rather unimpressed with this figure. The sword (yes, it glows blue) doesn't come out of his hand, and it doesn't look very much like Sting, mostly because his hand and the handle are all melded together.And the REMOVABLE cloak is just an option they put in so that they could boast that this figure has something that can be removed or put back on.I really feel I could do better in the way of a Frodo figure, the only way I'm keeping this is if there's not another Frodo to be found."
3,It's Alright.,"This toy is fine, but there is nothing special about it. In fact, there are more bad things about it than good. He's missing his jumper, the light up Sting is annoying and the cape is too heavy for the figure. At least it has a good face sculpt. See you later!"
2,Picture and sound are horrible,"Whoever did the transfer of these movies to DVD should get a job with the visually and aurily challenged. The prints were horrible to begin with, but then add frame flickering, bluriness and it gets worse.The only redeeming value of this 5 disc set is that it is Laurel & Hardy."
1,Hmmm,This set is - is okay - I suppose. I was expecting butter than these no name type of Laurel and Hardy movies. I watched them once and that was enough. They're not what I was expecting. Not worth owning!
5,Great Food from the Dining Car,"Really a fun book to have for the railroader with someone who loves to cook. Tons of fine recipies from railroads all over the country. SOME EXPERIENCE REQUIRED! I tried my hand at a dish, but it didn't turn out right despite following directions to the letter. Recently, Mom and I were successful. Her years of cooking experience handed down from Grandma paid off, because she noticed a missing step. Some basic preparation steps are left out becuase by the time a cook was assigned to the diner, he didn't need to see everything on paper. Since then, Mom and I have enjoyed many more weekend cooking classes with the dining car cookbook. Although many projects have turned out well, I'll always recall our first as my personal favorite: Western Pacific Rice Cream Pie. Good times!"
3,Caribbean by Michner,Condition of book was not as expected. It was rated too high. Condition was maybe at most Good not Very Good.
4,3 Purrrty Kitties,"I was looking for Cat Ornaments and found slim pickings. Hard to find--so far. These are heavy and basically outlines of cats/silhouettes. They are nice and good quality and a good buy at 3 ornaments for $4.99. I don't know that I would make this a gift to anyone--alone---they are not enough alone---you could group it with the ""GORHAM set of 3 Cat Ornaments"" (see my review). Altogether it would make a nice gift. They are kind of sweet. All ""Seasons of Cannon Falls"" ornaments seem to be pretty nice quality. I've purchased about 7 sets so far and have liked all of them."
5,just what I needed,This keyboard is just what I needed for a laptop without a numberpad.Much easier for spreadsheet applications!
2,No-go on my Mac,"I'm sure this works great on Windows, but not on my Mac (MacBook running 10.4 Tiger). After checking forums and the Targus website, I see no indication that you can expect this to work on Mac."
4,Nostalgia,"Great book on history of high schools and famous people who went there. Good for newcomers so they can understand answer to ""Where did..."""
4,Good reading for Lewis fans,The contributors to this book of essays - most of whom knew Lewis - have put together a nice volume of thoughtful comments about the man and his work. Good reading for Lewis fans.
2,It wasn't what I thought,I did not like the bag as much as I thought. Firt when I ordered it I thought I was getting brown but the red was okay but the quality of the bag did not impress me.
5,Who Said Diana Ross Can't Sing???,"Some people who don't understand vocals and singing think that if you don't yell like Patti, blow like Aretha, go to the upper echelon of your voice like Whitney or Scat like Ella you aren't singing. Diana Ross is without a doubt a SINGER. Of all the women mentioned above, Diana's silky voice sounds better than them all. Not talking about note hitting, talking about voice, style and emotion. Put this CD on then put on a cd by todays favorites, Hilton, Janet, Beyonce, Britney, Aguilera, Jessica, Toni Braxton (ok some of these arent todays faves anymore)but still. When you hear Diana sing Always and Forever and especially What About Love or I Love You, you will never say Diana Ross is not one of the best singers ever. This is Diana Ross, International ICON at her best!"
2,Is Diane Ross Living To Much In The Past,"In the past Diane Ross has touched me with her music but lately with her recent song ""I Love You"" it's like a remake of old songs that I use to hear. I wan't to hear original songs from the original artists is that to much to ask. To Diane Ross, you have a wonderful voice and you got talent but can't you be original and write new songs because the past is gone and the future is here."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED....,"I was terribly disappointed with the Pucci bikini I received. It was a completely different pattern, with different colors than the item I ordered from the picture on Amazon. The bikini was also 100% see-through. I returned the item to Amazon in September 2006 and I still haven't gotten my refund and it is now November 2006."
5,An Extraordinary Trip Down History's River Of No Return,"The history of what is called America, seen from our Native perspective (as well as that of many other peoples), is often dark and sanguinary -- and thus is frequently obscured. Turtle Island means much that is Good to the Iroquois -- and to other indigenous peoples. And ""Good"" -- Very Good -- is Bill Borden's use of Turtle Island as he deftly, and with simultaneous depth and height, organizes and coordinates his many gifts -- profound and sensitive insight, wide and reaching clarity, scrupulous honesty and integrity, and a very human humour -- into an extraordinary viewing complex for the bold and intelligent reader who, with vision, reaches out to History and takes this critical and important trip down a fascinating River Of No Return."
2,Not Tupperware's best,"This is not Tupperware's best product--it's difficult to seal completely, and the container itself is of much lower-quality plastic than typical Tupperware products. It's a nice size, and I do use it for storing the cut-up brownies from a 13 x 9 inch pan so they'll stay airtight, but I'm just disappointed in the weight and overall quality of the product."
4,Nice story,My 6 year old really liked the book. Its a challenge for a 6 yr old.. so perhaps 7 or 8 yrs would ve been more suitable.
5,Great for adults too! Heartwarming...wonderful...read it!,"I read this book as a child and loved it. Now I am going to be an English teacher soon...and I am constantly on the lookout for great books! A couple years ago I came across this book while looking through some old things. I read it again was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It made me smile, laugh, and cry.I am very close to my older sister (who is taller and thinner and I am shorter and fatter). I gave her the book as a gift, and she loved it as well. Now she's working overseas and I don't see her very often, but when I read this book I think of her...This is a very special book...read it and see for yourself. It will touch your heart. In a world where people are taught to be selfish, Frog and Toad All Year shows us that we need to put others first. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have and still do! ^_^"
1,Great story; poor Kindle format,"This is the same Frog and Toad that you know and love from the paper copies; however, it is unfortunately EXACTLY the same. There are two pages per landscape view on the Kindle Fire. There is no auto rotate or pinch to zoom, so the text is extremely small. This makes it challenging to read, especially for a new reader. Very disappointed."
5,Another Great Thomas DVD,"My 2 year old loves this Thomas DVD, he will watch it over and over. The stories are well developed."
5,Love it!,My son loves this movie. He watches this all the time. Thank you for the happy memories. I will be looking out for more deals!
4,Good book but overpriced,"This book deals with polypropylene technology, from catalysis to processing/applications. It is a very informative book and very useful, ... . I bought it for about 100.00 three years ago. You are better off borrowing from the library, because it is not a book that you are going to consult often. It is mostly for informative reading."
4,A very useful book.,A very good book for people interested in polypropylene. It does not spend an inordinate amount of time in any one subject. Covers the newer metallocene catalysts as well as the older polymerization technologies. Overall a well balanced book.
2,Pretty one sided...,"Medication for ADHD: Yes or No? The title should have been - Medication for ADHD: YES!!! YES!!! GOD YES, MEDICATE THEM!!! There is no other viewpoint than how great medications are for children with ADHD. Would have liked to seen both sides talked about."
4,Hamburger Freezer Set,We have used these in the past and are ideal for freezing hamburgers. It comes with a press that allows you to make good quality patties. It is dishwasher safe.
4,Buy it if you're interested in modern English literature.,"In this book can be found various articles previously published by different magazines by the famous political comentator Christopher Hitchens. Here we see another side of ""Hitch"", that of the critic of modern English literature, ranging from the witty 19th century plays of Oscar Wilde (whom he admires), to the leaden prose of the neo-conservative Norman Podhoretz (whom he most certainly destests). Even if you don't always agree with him (I find his views on religion repugnent) you don't have any appreciation of the English language if you don't get SOMETHING out of this book. As a student of the history of ideas I was fascinated by his account of Isaiah Berlin, and there are similar riches here for anyone interested in anglophone writing from the late 19th century until the turn of the current millenium. This is a fascinating book by a great prose stylist."
2,Defective book - no service from publisher,"I like the part of the book that I read, but the copy I purchased is defective. It includes pages 1-78, then repeats pages 47-78, then has pages 111-201. Pages 79-110 are not included in the book. I have written to the publisher about the problem, but without any response."
1,No Cigar for This Guy.,"I'm sorry. I watched this ""reverse racist"" act and cannot say anything positive about it. He uses obscenities to trash an American patriot who is defending our southern borders and the Constitution of the United States of America. He is a DANGER to America and encourages breaking our laws and entering our country ILLEGALLY! I would not pay one PENNY to this disgusting traitor!"
1,Found them cheap,"I purchased 4 of them at a great price but when I installed them on the 36"" x 72 "" lighted boxes I was building for a Church one broke at the rivet after about 5 openings. Another was already wearing at the rivet. The items are tarnished and not shiny. Made in China is what you get. I purchased a better quality at Lowes for about same price and you can see the quality difference. Wouldn't touch them again and didn't contact seller as I was in a hurry to finish the project."
5,One of the best wind concerto discs in the series,"The oboe is fine by itself, and there are dozens of oboe concertos available, also sonatas and smaller chamber works. The playing on this disc is excellent, both strings and wind, oboe and bassoon.The bassoon concertos add good contrast. If you like these, check out the two Vivaldi bassoon discs on the same label.I play this and the two bassoon discs quite often.There are also many concertos for flute and other wind instruments together. Those discs are also in the Naive series. But this disc an excellent start to explore wind concertos of Vivaldi."
5,"BRILLIANT, ABSORBING, A TRULY MAGNIFICENT GIFT!","I FIRST READ THIS BOOK AFTER ATTENDING A MICHAEL ROWLAND SEMINAR AND I HAVE USED IT SINCE AS A GUIDE TO TRUE PEACE AND ETERNAL LOVE. MICHAEL'S EXTRAORDINARY TEACHING OFFERS HAPPINESS AND HOPE WHEN IT FEELS LIKE THEY NO LONGER EXIST. I READ THIS BOOK DURING A DARK EPISODE IN MY LIFE, AND WHILE I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS MYSELF WHO DID THE HARD YARDS, WITHOUT ""ABSOLUTE HAPPINESS"", MY JOURNEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL MORE ARDUOUS. TO MICHAEL I SAY, THANK YOU FOR OFFERING YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIAL GIFT, WITHOUT YOU THE UNIVERSE WOULD NOT NEARLY BE SUCH FANTASTIC AND UNIQUE PLACE!"
5,You can't put this book down,"In the Interest of Justice is a great book.I just spent 4 hours on a delayed flight. I am glad I had the book with me. It is a very interesting book, especially for non-lawyers."
3,Student text book,"Like most text books, this book has interesting, academic, mature facts with little relavance to modern practical use. But if you are studying at a university that requires it, then it's just the ticket."
3,Osho? Never heard of him...,"I was directed to this book by a friend at work who said the book helped her with intimate relationships. I am a Christian, so I was a little leary of ""venturing out"" of the ordinary authors to find advice on intimacy. I found a lot of what Osho said about intimacy very sensible, realistic, and applicable to most all people who have problems with becoming intimate with others. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their chances with others in an intimate relationship."
5,Of Men and Mountains,"A classic memoir of wilderness adventure. Easy reading for the outdoor enthusiast. Fishing, hiking, and friendship in the great outdoors. Read and enjoy!!!! By William O. Douglas U.S. Supreme Court Justice 1939-1975"
1,BEWARE,"I purchased something similar and it only worked w/ Windows 95, nothing more recent. Do not purchase this w/o inquiring as to which OS it works with!"
4,"Works well does not fog, 7x?? is the max for the water","PROS:No fogging. Be aware that you must focus each eye separately - this eliminates the middle focus ring that then moves each eye cup. That means more places for water to get in.Bright and clear with sharp focus.7x50 - 7x means 7 times magnification, and 50 means 50mm lens size. 7x is the MAX for hand held especially in a boat. You could even lower that to 5x for a boat where the action of the waves makes if difficult to keep the image still.Solid build quality.CONS:A bit heavy / large. But this is the price you pay for large lens that let in lots of light and are very clear.No middle / center focus ring - each eye must be focused one at a time.Your hands / arms will tire quickly.Strap - could be longer by 12"" or so and softer around the neck. You can easily replace or modify the strap.TIP:place hands as close to the end as possible to keep the image steady."
3,marine binoculars,"good for the price. a little heavy and awkward, but overall they work well. do not fog up like others i have used."
4,Bushnell Binoculars,This product was reasonably priced and is very water resistant and does not cloud up. I received it fast and am happy with it.
4,A sense of beauty,"Formerly known as the Orpheus Trio (not to be confused with today's Orpheus Chamber Orchestra), this ensemble offers a rare treatment of Ravel's Sonatine (for Piano, originally) for flute, harp and viola. It is an arrangement inspired by Debussy's late Trio Sonata, no doubt (also on this CD),and it succeeds at posing as her long-lost sister. We are treated as well to popular solo works, the Faure harp piece made famous to some film buffs by Mr. H. Marx, and Debussy's still-weird Syrinx. The Devienne, though well-executed, somehow seems out of place with the other pieces more contemporary to each other.This is a CD to play on a summer weekend morning, with a day of leisure ahead of you. It may help to calm you and inspire a sense of beauty to last until evening."
1,"Great movie - shame about the ""Audio described"".","An all-time classic movie and, after all, how distracting can an audio description be? Well, taking a chirpy, rather piercing Canadian voice over the austere English environment certainly rammed home my mistake. I would like to review the rest of the movie but 10 seconds was all I could take which didn't even reach the end of the credits.Perhaps when I can get hold of a non-dubbed version, I can offer a fuller review."
1,Disappointing...,"This movie is an hysterically funny film. Alas, this particular DVD version has all the quality of an early 1950's rotoscope. The film is nearly unwatchable, unlike many other Ealing Studios releases currently available on DVD. If another product with the same film is available, try it instead."
3,Brit's humor,"The first one we've watched ""Whiskey Galore"" is a classic and one we've thought of and hoped to see once more for years. It was wonderful to see the cast and the action and the story but our one regret is that it does not have subtitles in English. The sound track is difficult to follow with the accents and it would have been perfect if there were subtitles to read along with the action. It is fun to see all these old classics and it brings back memories but the sound made it difficult."
2,Passport to Pimlico,"this is not remastered, it is a sloppy copy DVD from an unknown source in a cheap box, with broken lugs, and a cheap sleeve - worst thing to come from Amazon or an associate. Have not watched it yet too busy."
4,Classic British G rated entertainment,Simply entertaining 50s British comedy. All in a value for money package.Should be in every DVD collection.
2,horrible sound transfers--needs subtitles,"can't remember any of these being all that good in sound quality. I'm currently turning off ""Passport to Pimlico"" due to the horrible sound transfer. No subtitles available either."
5,Fantastic,"I just love this CD. I never get tired of listening to it. Jose Alfredo Jimenez is Mexico's great composer. I first heard him when I was a kid. My dad loved his music. After many years of listening to rock music, I decided to go back and listen to Mexican music. This is one of the first CDs I bought. It brought back memories of days gone by. All people of Mexican descent should become familiar with the music of this great man. I am grateful that my dad introduced me to this music."
5,Illuminating,This DVD is educational for those who were not quite old enoughto remember why the United Nations was originally formed. It alsooutlines the faults which have occurred since the originalcharter was signed.
1,Far right nonsense,Only useful to members of the loony right who want their prejudices confirmed and those who believe their country is never wrong about anything.
1,Does Size Matter ?,"Certainly looks good. Made of solid brass is good. Matching brass screws are also good. Stanley products are built well; that is good.But, where, oh where, are the measurements for the lift? Certainly, a buyer would want to know the overall length, as well as, the boring !!Bad, bad, bad and that is not good."
2,Doesn't work for everyone,"This product was painfully constipating and bothered my stomach. The doctor recommended this as it was supposed to be easy to absorb. I, however, did not absorb it and all and my hemoglobin went down while I was taking it, daily."
3,floradix supplement,This product is helpful in boosting blood iron levels. The taste is marginally acceptable. The smell is medicinal. I believe it is useful for all who experience low energy as a result of low hemoglobin/hematocrit issues.
1,"Gather round, you sir try this remedy it cure ye ailments.","This is the biggest snake oil scam in history, the form of this iron is organic??? loli used this and the tablet form of floradix the best way to increase iron is through proper iron tablets e.g. ferrous sulfatethis stuff is nothing more than an old wives tales ailment curing potion... dont fall for the scam like i did. blood tests prove this does nothing after consistent useage...the only reason this stuff 'works' for pregnant women is because they use it after they had a baby and iron levels would rise anyways... ask any genuine anemic person to use it..."
2,hard to open top,"I would not purchase this product again. The safety cap is ridiculously hard to open and kept me from even wanting to use this product. I take too many pills and was looking forward to not have to digest another capsule is why I purchased this in the first place. Opening it was such a challenge that it was impossible to use this product within 30 days of opening, the other issue I have with this. I did not see that recommendation before I bought this, otherwise I wouldnt have. If you have super dextrous fingers and another person in your family that might take this Iron with you, otherwise, the recommended dosage is impossible to complete within 30 days (and I take alot of iron!)"
1,Horrible tasting!,"I couldn't get over the horrible taste of this product. Really awful. Even closing my nose and drinking it down with full glass of water. It has a terrible after taste that made me want to gag. Kind of like rotten raisins left in a metallic container. I only used it a few times and the taste never got better. The rest is going to get dumped down the sink. If I had the choice, I would go with tablets over the elixir. I don't know how anyone could think this was delicious."
4,Better than pill form,I like that this product also has vitamin B in it & that I can drink it. I hate taking any pills so this is the only way to try to get me away from being anemic where my diet fails. Make sure to refridgerate & I drink it with juice because it does not taste good.
1,Stomach Disaster,Gave me the worst stomach ache of my life... I almost thought I had food poisoning. If you have a sensitive stomach at all I would not recommend this product.
2,Terrible Side Effect,"I had high hopes for this one. I read everyone's reviews here and spoke with the local vitamin store manager about side effects, particularly constipation. Of course, I was assured that it doesn't cause that at all.I'm here to tell you, it has caused me the most horrible constipation issues, EVER. This might not happen for those less sensitive to iron supplements, but for your average sensitive person like me, it's just awful!I don't mind the taste at all, and I brush my teeth right after to prevent the ""blue stain"" everyone mentioned. I even reduced the dosage to once a day instead of the recommended 2, to see if that help with the constipation issue. Nope! And it takes DAYS to get over it. It doesn't matter if this product even works to raise my iron levels - it's not worth it at this very painful price to my digestive system!"
5,GIVES ME STRENGTH & PREVENTS BRUISING,EASY TO DRINK LIQUID IRON. SWEET TASTE AND EASIER TO FIND ONLINE. COST IS BETTER THAN COMMERCIAL STORES. THATS IF THEY HAVE IT IN STOCK.
4,great product for women,"this is a great product , especially for women who usually lack iron. I don't eat much meat , and with this product having b-vitamin as well, is great. i noticed the results about a week later."
5,best ever vit-drink,After looking for something that would be easy to swallow specially when it comes to iron. It has always upset my stomach. but with this product I have felt great and not worry about the stomach problems. Finally a product that can help those of us that are tire of taking pill form vitamins.
5,Great Product,I used this product during my entire pregnancy and had no problems with low iron levels or anemia. Since I stayed in the hospital for 2 months during the preg my blood was taken often and this product kept me and my babies (twins) healthy and my levels normal.
1,Yuk!!!!!,"Tastes awful, and has a strong aftertaste. Worst yet, it still upset my stomach. I took it for two days, that's all I could stand!"
3,Good product. Gives energy. The lid of the bottle is terribly leaky!,"I like the product. It certainly gives energy level boost - I am not as lethargic in the mid-afternoon as I was before I began taking it a few weeks ago. I must complain about the packaging - the lid of the bottle is extremely leaky. Because the product requires you to shake before use, there is always a mess on the floor :-( (and a waste of product)! Very unfortunate."
4,Good taste!,"I could leave a better review if my iron has been tested since starting this product, but it has not, so I can't tell you how my iron levels are. All I can say is, it's a relatively pleasant tasting alternative to other iron supplements, and I've suffered no ill effects. I have noticed my energy is better since taking this. In fact, I ran out last week (waiting for my next shipment) and I'm already feeling really fatigued (I'm 8 months pregnant)."
2,Worst Cap Design,The product itself seems to be working but the cap is the worst! Childproof caps have come along way but Floradix didn't seem to get the memo. I've lost about a quarter of the bottle (and it's not cheap stuff!) due to spills either shaking the bottle and the cap not being on right or by trying to get the stupid cap off. It drives me crazy!!
4,Gentle on the stomach but tough on the teeth,"I'll say straight away that I felt better within two weeks after taking this liquid form of iron. Energy back. Very effective product. I'm a vegetarian and sometimes my ferritin level dips. I can't take women's multivitamins with iron. Only liquid ones are gentle, and they're more effective than tablets too.However, you'd better brush your teeth right afterward. After taking it for no more than a month, everyone notices my teeth and says, ""Why are your teeth reflecting a blue color?"" Just the thing every girl wants to hear! The dentist can remove most of the staining too."
2,Iron supplement may have caused headaches,"I experienced severe headaches upon waking in the morning while taking a liquid iron supplement, Floradix. It did appear to raise my iron levels for my restless leg syndrome was less bothersome, but at a price, The headaches would improve gradually after arising."
1,Nasty Dishwasher Residue,"Sure they're indestructible, but so's the white residue left on them after going through the dishwasher! No amount of scrubbing, scraping or hand washing will permanently remove the crud, plus it just comes right back in all its glory after running through the dishwasher. Very disappointing!!"
5,Still Keeping It Gangsta,"GP improves from his two previous albums, His lyrics keep going harder. I think his beats also improve too, that's one of the reasons why this album is so great. The standout tracks are ""That Type"" ""The Saga Continues"" ""Homicidal Lifestyle"", The Album name ""Sex, Money & Murder"", and lastly the laid back track ""Gangsta Luv"". I Think you should cop this if you like gangsta & hardcore music."
1,binocular video camera,I am having a very difficult time getting pictures in focus. Colors seem to be distorted.
4,tasco binoculars with camera,this was bought as a christmas gift for my dad so we won't know how he feels about it until then. we like it well enough that we will buy one for ourselves.
2,tasco snapshot 10x25,"is terrible the pictures are awful inside a place and outside also, to download theimage. is bad i ould not get elp from the manufacture to download the image. i call servral times and no answer the cd from the tasco that it came to download the system is not compatible i would not recomend.."
1,Useless....,"This princess toddler ""table"" is absolutely useless and serves no purpose. It's flimsy and is just for looks to coordinate with the bed . Don't waste your money."
1,What about the victims?,"I was very disappointed that the authors didn't write about the victims of Danny Starrett's crimes. It was 400 pages of Danny and his Mother, Gerry's feelings and thoughts. Which were very self-serving. At one point, when asked in a television interview what she would like to say to Danny's victims, his Mother said in essence, feel sorry for Danny. This book was a forum for an overbearing, selfish mother to tell us what a wonderful, sweet child her son was. He murdered, kidnapped, raped 12 year old children! What about them?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! WASTE OF MONEY!,"This book was the biggest waste of money! It was all about poor Gerry Starrett and her poor psycho son, who kidnapped and raped several girls, even murdering one. And oh how horrible his life in prison was. Not one word about the victims and their families. This book is very one-sided. I can't believe a family would even have the gall to write a book in defense of a murderous son."
4,"A weird, but satisfying story","I can understand why some people didn't care for this. Many are drawn to true crime for the suspense, the investigation and the satisfying ending such books usually offer. In this book, the crimes have been comitted and the perpetrator caught, with half a book to go. The book's about David, the weirdly ""perfect"" kid who ends up kidnapping and killing young girls, his extremely weird family, and the various lawyers and psychiatrists who tried to make sense of this bizarre case. It's about the death penalty, how the law views sanity, and how these terrible crimes touched so many people. I was fascinated by the peculiarly Southern weirdness of the mother's challenged reality and profound denial. There aren't really any ""good guys"" here, and that will be disappointing to some readers. I found this to be a thoughtful and well-written look at the kind of troubling case that defies simplistic characterization."
2,A mother's perspective on her killer son,After reading the first three chapters of this book I ended up skippingthrough the rest of it just to get the basic details of who and why Danny killed and molested so many young girls. I found the book to be mostly a ones sided perspective from his mother. She sounded like she was making excuses for her son's horrific deeds. The book kept jumping back and forth between victims and time line of events. I found myself having to re-read the beginning several times just to remember in what sequence the events occured. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they were totally bored and needed some quick entertainment.
1,A status-quo history,"I was disappointed greatly with the contents of the book. Hoskin and Gingerich peddle the old Eurocentric view of astronomy. Short shrift is given to the views of scholars such as R.R. Newton and Dennis Rawlins. The presentation of material is very shallow, and the tangled web behind the advances of Kepler and others is not presented. It is like whitewash."
4,Great Speakers,"These speakers have excellent sound and aren't expensive. The do not produce bass, so you'll need some kind of sub woofer. The can't not be used as stand alone bookshelf speakers."
2,Bummed Out,I like the pants I received but they are not the ones shown on Amazon.com My black pants do not have Ooh La La written on the backside like the photo shows... also though they are comfortable... the second time I wore them they feel off my butt. They stretched out way to fast... I'm guessing they will shrink once I was and dry them but it's unfortunate they don't stay on anymore after I wore them only once.
2,return policy didn't work for me,"I ordered the wrong size, shipped the pants back to ooh la la the address that was on the pack. Another Company sent them back to me saying they never sent them to me $9.00 pair of pants with shipping back and forward I'm up to $20.00 and I still have the wrong size. Ended up given them to a small friend, a waste of money."
4,YOU ARE THERE!,"This book is like having a conversation with Danny Barker. You are there, being guided through four generations of New Orleans musicians, reliving detailed moments in jazz history. His words invoke vibrant images of the jazz funerals, brass bands, the french quarter. He offers a ""chronological discography"" in the back of the book. It encompasses 1931-1975 and is an amazing compilation of recordings and artists. If only Ken Burns had consulted and included Danny Barker and highlighted some of his performances, his ""Jazz"" documentary would be what this book is - a treasure."
4,Typical for Library of Contemporary Architects/Masters of Modern Architecture series,"Unlike others in the Library of Contemporary Architects, Philip Johnson was an active fascist sympathizer and active propagandist for the Nazi government, who had tried to implement fascism in USA for at least 8 years between 1932 and 1940. Details of this past are described in ""WE CANNOT NOT KNOW HISTORY:"" PHILIP JOHNSON'S POLITICS AND CYNICAL SURVIVAL by KAZYS VARNELIS in Journal of Architectural Education, November 1994 published also on the Net, and discussed on the Design Community Web page."
5,Great book for anyone curious about the main concepts of immigrant integration in Germany,"I gathered some 20 books and other reading material for a political science term paper on the integration of immigrants in Germany and this book was probably the most helpful. The research is through and reliable and the writing style really cuts to the chase. Although it was published in 2002, the information is still very reliable and recent. Klopp touches on all the main points of immigrant integration: work, education, and political representation, as well as housing, although this is not so much of an issue in Germany as it is in France. I also highly recommend this book for anyone even interested in the effects of globalization on immigrant populations."
1,Easterling,"This LOTR figure does not create any fun action. If anything, its just another bad guy for the main characters to slaughter. To make this figure more Easterling... it should have included a Katana or a Naginata."
3,Mostly bad jokes but a few truly funny ones,I'm sure there are many ten-twelves who would love the scatalogical humor which is excessive. It was mostly too much for my five-year-old son who found this book at the library. I credit the book for teaching him how to tell a joke. I don't have a problem with a five-year-old telling an age-appropriate dirty joke. Sample: What's the difference between a brussel sprout and a booger? You can't get a kid to eat a brussel sprout.
1,REALLY GROSS,"My son loves joke books and wanted to get this one. The title should have been my clue and I should have said no. I had no idea the jokes would be this ""gross""!I found the jokes very inappropriate for young readers or for anyone for that matter. I feel like there are much better books for kids to read than this joke book filled with nasty jokes."
5,Great Item,"arrived quickly, looks exactly like the picture.. very flattering suit. very pleased with purchase."
5,Great for oily/acne prone skin,I have been using Wibi lotion for years at night. My skin breaks out easily and this lotion does not irritate it at all. I also tend to have allergic reactions to lotions around my eyes and this causes no irritation. Work great without causing any problems.
2,Flimsy,"I picked up a package of these figuring, hey, they're half the price (per stylus) of the Sony replacements. Ugh. They're horrid. They aren't strong enough to stay straight while writing with them. I'm ready to throw the lot out already. Avoid these. They're junk."
3,not so bad...,"Well, I bought these out of absolute necessity - no other source for the original Sony Clie aluminum sytlus - and was pleasantly surprised with what I received. Granted, they're not aluminum but hard plastic. But, unless you're an absolute beast with your equipment and tear everything to h*** within a month, this set of four plastic styluses (or is it styli??) will do just fine, thank you very much. And you can't beat the price..."
4,"A Seminal Book, Beware of the Author","I've read a lot of self-help books and this is one that's had an influence along w/ Disowned Self, also by Branden. Branden's relationship w/ and falling out w/ Ayn Rand are well documented. I saw him speak several years ago shortly after Rand's death and he definitely took the low road. Like his hero, Rand, his personal life hasn't lived up to the ideals presented in his books, but the ideas that he gives us are potent. Recommended."
5,Bushnell Marine 7 x 50 Binoculars w/ digital compass,The Bushnell 7 x 50 binoculars are a very choice for use on a power boat. The digital compass is reliable and accurate.
5,Marine Binoculars,"I bought these for my (future) sailboat but in the meantime have used them for nature hikes and such. They produce pretty bright and sharp images. I'm sure there's better binoculars on the market but for the price (a close-out item when I bought them) I'd have to pay much, much more to get something superior to them."
5,OEM GM Item,"Installed this chain kit in my 2000 Saturn and the part numbers of the gears and chain were OEM numbers. The oilier though seem of a different design then the updated GM oilier. I have about 25,000 miles on the chain since install and have no problems at all. With all the problems GM had with these chains and the cost involved when they let loose, I can only go with the updated OEM chain even though there are cheaper clones on the market. 2003 and up had the redesigned oilier and that is what I believe this kit contains."
4,Overeaters Bible,"According to the person I bought this book for, this is one of the best books for people who suffer of eating disorders. I did not read it and specifically asked the person for a rating of 1 to 5 and said 4."
3,TV-VHS Combo,"No longer have. Cannot recall how long I had the item since it was one of the first items purchase at Amazon.com many years ago. While it was working, service was good. I have forgotten the event that led to it being no longer in service."
2,Does not work on DC,The TV does not work on DC power. OK on AC power. This very disappointing. The TV is in a repair shop now so I am unable to use it. I have to pay for it when I order it but I am unable to use the TV. Not fair.
3,Truly a crossover book ....,"This book could actually be listed as a very spicy romance novel rather than a Black Lace erotica book.In this story we follow our heroine, Emma, in the late 1800's as she travels Europe in search of adventure and mischief. Learning that she is barren, Emma takes it upon herself to leave her husband and then basically take a deep seated revenge on any young man that crosses her path by being the first 'woman' to seduce them. The un-erotic part of this book for myself is that many of these 'young' men are well into their 20's ..... in my mind thats not really seducing young men but rather doing them a favour ...The book is well written and the characters well defined, but in the hot sizzling sex department that I would expect from Black Lace it fizzles rather than sizzles ..."
2,Upsetting....,"I am a HUGE Tupperware fan. Even with all the cheaper immitations, I still fork over the money for the plastic with the lifetime warranty! But this particular product is disappointing. I understand that it is a ""mini"", but they shouldn't have made the holes ""mini"". I find mine does not like to drain because the holes are just too small. I've even tried putting on the lid so that I could drain more aggresively, but it has just found its way into the back of my cabinet! :("
1,The worst!,"This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, bar none!!! There is nothing good to say about it...the directing, acting, picture quality...everything is terrible!!!"
5,Monster Man,Just awful! I loved it and shared it with one of my disturbed friends. I never miss a film with Conrad Brooks.
5,A Must for All Latin Music Lovers,"This is the kind of music that they don't record anymore. This is a collection of timeless recordings.right up there with the ""Buena Vista Social Club"". Sees Miami, FL"
5,If you are lucky enough to get your hands on it!!!,This is the most comprehensive unbeleivably lavish box set ever. There is only a couple of thousands in the world...and I have one....
1,Truly Unhappy,"I was very upset when the T-Bar did not fit my 3/4 T-Track on my table saw. But what upset me even more was that it did not fit into any of my shop equipment. I didn't mind paying a bit more for an item that is a ""specialty"" item. However, now I am stuck with nothing more than an overpriced slide and rail. Now I'm too afraid to purchase anything else for my shop through Amazon.com for fear it wont fit my equipment and I'll be stuck with more useless junk."
1,Just plain bad,"I bought this thinking it might be interesting and it boggles my mind how I could be so wrong. It's not even good bad-- it's just bad bad. It's the worst kind of home movie you could ever watch. EVERYTHING about this film sucks-- 'nuff said, watch at your own risk."
1,The wrost of the wrost.,I bought a DVD and find that was the wrost of the wrost. If you want a good horror movie this isn't an option. This dvd sucks. If you can avoid even see this dvd will be good for you.
5,Prairie Alligators,"I liked Spivak and a lot of the characters, including minor ones like the hotel clerk. The sense of the hotel, the barge full of scrap metal, the brewery, Chicago in general, is superb. Noway to write this without the author himself having gone through actual Chicago manholes and tunnels. The book is terrifically plotted, moves right along.I look forward to the next installment."
1,NO CD,"The title of this product, ""The Wadsworth Anthology of Poetry (with Poetry 21 CD-ROM)"" implies that it comes with a CD--a CD that i needed vitally for my English class. I will not buy from this seller again."
5,RAAAR!!!,"Possibly the best ""Lord of the Rings"" double figure set ever! This set is so cool!I especially like the Elven Archer figure. He come with lots of accessories and his armor is really tight. He comes with four arrows and a quiver, a detachable helm, an Elven bow and an Elven sword. He has real bow-firing action and the Elven sword fits in his hand very well.Now, about the Berserker Uruk-Hai. He is also a really cool figure but he does not have as many accessories as Elven Archer, but they are still really cool. He comes with a helm with the white hand painted on it. He also comes with a double- bladed broad sword, with two spikes on either side at the top. He has the best attack action of all the 'LOTR' figures -- it is so realistic how he swings it! Watch out! Raaaar!These figures are highly detailed and textured and I would recommend this set to any fan of the 'Lord of the Rings' films or any toy collector."
5,the good the bad and THE UGLY,"well I got these toys in october 2002,so let me put it this way, its pretty ""good"" for four and a half months and then things start getting ""bad"" the archers arm broke off in febuary 2003, thats when things start getting ""UGLY"" because the uruks hand got ""hacked"" off. But great deteil, oh yea the archer really fires the bow.If your wandering the archer has an elven sword and the uruk one big sword.Only worth the money if you dont play with it much."
1,Don't bother,"This is an extremely THIN book with little to offer. A few notes seem to have been stretched into 76 pages with large type, and big margins. Some ""chapters"" are 2-3 pages long. If you're interested in the topic, I'd recommend looking online for reports on corporate codes of conduct (done by the OECD, ILO, etc.)."
5,Works as designed,Works great for my dog who likes to go from one side of road to the other sniffing things- so the wrap around feature works great.
3,"ok, but gets caught on buckles","I bought this to run with my two standard poodles. It does not work well with two dogs as if they switch places, the leashes tangle and then they don't move around the belt freely. I also find that it gets stuck on the buckles and rather than moving freely around the belt, the belt rotates. I bought the bungee attachment, but although it works for allowing for for lunging it is rather heavy and will bang against my legs while running. I also purchased what I thought would be a second leash, but it did not have a clasp to attach to the dog collar. So what good is a leash without the clasp?? I still need to return these items as they are useless."
1,misleading ad,Ordered this and realized that this was only the leash attachment rather than the entire belt as implied by the picture.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"This is a wonderfully designed product.I have three Goldens, hence my handle, and having a hand free walking them in the morning is a wonderful thing.If you add the lunge adapter to this it makes it even better when one has a 100 pound golden attached to you!Recommend highly!"
5,Couldn't be easier,"This is a great way to go for anyone interested in having free hands while walking or running. I thought my dog would have trouble figuring out where to stay with me as I ran, but on the very first run we did great together. It's so much better having her on my waist than carrying the leash in my hand as I run. I also look forward to using it while hiking since I hike with poles."
2,Broke in less than a year,"I love this system, but it broke in less than a year of using it. The metal clip to attach it to the dog's collar/harness fell apart."
1,Avoid Even If You're A Die-Hard Fan,"I have to agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer that said the only worthwhile part of this book are the interviews, but that's not saying much. I bought this book thinking I would get, as advertised, ""the stories behind the songs"". Not only is this completely false, but I'm not sure the author knows anything about KISS at all. All he did was listen to the song lyrics, regurgitate them back with some loose interpretation of what they're supposed to mean, and that's your story behind the song. No other insight, research, or nothing. If you want a good insightful look at KISS, I highly recommend ""KISS Alive Forever: A Touring History"". Don't waste your money on this ..., even if you're a diehard fan."
1,Rip It Off,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. The book is not what is promised. Just explanations about the what the songs are about. Descriptions that are even below the level of amatuer Rolling Stone reviewers. Keep your money and don't waste it on this -- even the pictures are not worth the amount paid."
1,Where is the no star button?,Didn't Rick Derringer play guitar in All American Man? No mention of that here. This book is just one guys view of what he thinks the songs are about. There aren't many actual facts on what the members were really thinking when they wrote their songs. This book is a total waste of time and money. I am so glad I didn't pay cover price for it. True KISS fans need to just stay away from this book.Grade: F
1,Complete waste of money,"DO NOT buy this book. It is pure crap. It does not provide information about each song, rather just this guys opinion. Any information that is passed off as being actual ""stories behind the songs"" was stolen from other books and magazine articles.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this."
4,Excellent Granola,I start off the morning every morning w/ a bowl of this granola; its great! A touch of sweetness and a great crunch! Also on Amazon Grocery it can be purchased at a great price!
5,Best Granola Anywhere!,Oatmeal raisin is my favorite type of granola and I have tried many different brands. Erin Baker's is the best by far. Very crunchy and not too sweet. I like it right out of the bag as a snack and as a ceral with milk. Great stuff!!
5,Best Granola EVER!,"This is my favorite granola, hands down. it doesn't have that weird processed taste like so many foods do these days. It's the prefect combination of chewy, crunchy and sweet plus it's very healthy as a snack or on vanilla yogurt for a meal."
4,chair was just what we needed for my husband,I got this chair because the one the VA had gave us over 10 years ago had the cushion seat tear up over the years and could not find one fit it so order this chair and it works great plus smaller size so does not take up as much room.i order it on line one day got it the very next day by fed ex . super fast service . thanks my husband was thrill get one with seat cover .
4,"Ok, but needed extra improvements for comfort","The commode is very basic, so we attached soft toilet seat cushion for comfort and a wooden plank in the back for stability. It is being used every night and helps out in the care of a very elderly person."
1,Can't sit on it,"This item arrived without the seat, but only the lid and the bucket with its lid. So sitting on it is pretty uncomfortable, but you do what you have to do! After 48 hours, the dealer has not responded to an email requesting that the missing seat be sent. This is one of those post-surgery items that are a necessity and should arrive as early as possible and with all its parts. Otherwise, the product is okay. It's more flimsy than most, but what can you reasonably expect for the low price? It would not be suitable for a very heavy person."
1,"84-88 TOYOTA PICKUP TAIL LIGHT LH (DRIVER SIDE) TRUCK,","I DO NOT Recomend ordering from this company.I placed my order on 1/14/2010. I was told that I would receive item between 1/21/2010 and 1/26/2010. I placed a negitive review on this item, I then recieved phone calls from Peter (877-221-0514) option #4 He said they were sorry for the delay and wanted to refund the shipping cost ($12.99) which is insane for a 1 lb. plastic part!He said this could only be done if I removed my negitive review, so I did remove my negitive review on about 2/2/2010. I finally recieved my part on 2/4/2010. It is now 3/10/2010 I tried to call today.....no return call. I have not recieved any refund....I don't like being lied to!!!Peter told me that they recieved over 5 feet of snow (in california) this is why my part was delayed. That is odd because I also ordered the passenger side lens at the same time and recieved it in about a week.Larry L IR,Mi."
1,DOn't watch this movie. It sucks big time,The plot stinks like a dead skunk lying on the main road.teh actors leave much to be desired. Stay away.
1,Total dislike it.,Not for me as a christian. Not the Hemingway I wanted to see. Never read the book and won't if it is this.
2,Superficial and smug. Poor Ernest is probably rolling in his grave,"Watching this, one doesn't know whether to fast-forward to the sex scenes or away from them. A curious mixture of softcore porn and literary highfalutin-ness. I wouldn't necessarily mind either, but not a good mixture in this case. The book it's based on, though incomplete and not fully successful or ""fully realized,"" is nevertheless much more compelling and intriguing. Here, Catherine/Devil is just one-dimensional and scary. (Why would anybody bother with her, let alone fall in love with her?) In the book, however, as I recall it, she's complex; her character unfolds gradually. Plus you're equally aware of Hemingway's misogyny and fear of women. In other words, though it's far from a great book, there are depths to the characters that are almost unimaginable from this superficial, facile film."
3,Hemingway's Garden of Eden,This is a a beautiful to look at movie set in lovely part of world. Story ok abit all over the place at times. The actors are all pretty which helps if you like that type of thing. If your looking for girl on girl action its not really the best movie.
2,Really,I was a little lost watching this movie. It didn't really make sense to me. What woman invites another woman into their relationship.
1,not much to think about,"I was hoping this movie had meaningful story, but just porn with stuck up wife of David. The story just plain He was showered up gifts and money, then afterward realized thats not love, how smart!!"
3,No remorse,"This is one of my favorite books and I was anxious to see the movie version. It had good looking people and it was sort of about the book. But the book was about the nature of androgyny, role playing and a woman wanting to be a man because she felt powerless as a woman. The movie was about a threesome. Marita was a real disappointment and David was a bland cipher in no way a representation of Hemingway. Devil wasn't devilish. She had the look, her haircuts were great and she did an OK job, but she just didn't have the sexual spark needed to carry the story. I have no regrets about buying the movie, I wanted to see it and enjoyed it. But it could have been so much better."
1,Not worth watching,"Boring to say the least. A complete waste of time. Nothing really happens, and the characters are crazy. The description of the movie does not explain what it is about, and it was not what I expected. Plain."
2,Read the Book,"There's nothing of merit really in this movie that you wouldn't more profitably accrue in the book. I was fine with the factual changes they made, conflating some scenes, adding some facts, etc., but there were a few problems I had.One, the scenes were way too fast. The movie picks up after about thirty minutes and the scenes start getting a little better pacing to them, but overall I thought it was a pretty poorly paced film. I never really felt anchored, and therefore never felt weight in the scenes which were supposed to give weight.Two, I didn't think the acting was fabulous. It wasn't terribly, but those are difficult roles to play.I'd say this probably isn't worth your money.Read the book. It was Hemingway's freakish surreal/fantasy novel before he killed himself."
5,Great buy,Got this piece as a fast solution and turned out works so well that i never went to buy a steel one as i had planed.The lid works great and helps get out the extra water and works good as a double strainer for homemade fresh juices too!
1,The FrontPage 2000 Version,"I can't believe I bought this, one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Far from being a step-by-step how to actually set up a web site, it's filled with ""if you want to do this, then do this, or if you want to do that, then do that."" Perhaps I'm more comfortable with programming books that actually step you through a series of ever-increasingly-complex projects in order to teach you how to use the languange. This book reads more like a reference book for those who already know FrontPage, or a page-by-page description of what the controls will do rather than why I would want to use the control in the first place. IMO, it's hardly a beginner's book, and not worth the deeply discounted price it's selling for."
1,You've got to be kidding.,"This is one of the worst-formatted, hardest-to-use books I know -- and I'm very familiar with technical and instructional writing. It might be that this book includes ""how to do everything,"" but finding it is a nightmare. The author seems intent on trying to say everything at once."
1,Doesn't fit all 99 and UP,I purchased this for my 2002 GMC Sierra. As stated in another review the bolt used to secure the lock didn't fit. I modified the hole and made the bolt fit and the lock still didn't work because the levers that hold the latch system did not line up correctly. I am really disappointed in this product and I would not recommend buying it.In the end I'm out about $20 for this item. I paid $27.95 to purchase. Paid $10 to ship it back and got a $20 rebate. so I'm out $17 on what should have been a $20 purchase. Next time I'll go to a local vendor for something like this. I wouldn't have lost any money.
1,Poor craftsmanship in bolt assembly.,"I purchased this item, hoping it would be easy to install. The instructions were simple; however, the bolt that came with the lock didn't fit. The threaded hole was too small for the bolt and it was not worth returning to the seller."
4,Cortot in what he does best,Cortot is one of the legendary pianists. This recording of the preludes and the ballades is better for him than the etudes. There are fewer technical demands and allow him to show of his poetic and interpretive gifts.The engineers have done a credible job in making these recordings from the 1940s sound pretty good. I like the softer and less brilliant piano sound that was the norm back then. Today is just too bright and harsh for my tastes. But that is another story.Email me if you want to talk about pianos.
3,SMITHERS!!!!!,"uhh yeah, I had high hopes for this mask but it was just too small for my head. Not recommended for those of us who have big noggins. Maybe one has to be old and shriveled to truly wear the mask."
4,My teacher,"Being my teacher, Dr. Reisner speaks of his novel every so often. It is very interesting because Dr. Reisner is very passionate about this subject so I'm sure this book reflects his insights of the subject."
5,bought as a replacement,"I tried to revive my existing otoscope/ophthalmoscope by buying new rechargeable batteries, but that did not work. The otoscope/ophthalmoscope heads work fine, but aren't interchangeable with the newer small handles. I found the new replacement handle, while it is 1/4 inch longer, fits with the heads and works perfectly fine. I am very happy to continue to use the parts that work. I think the price on this handle is lower than when I made my first purchase in 1995!!!"
4,Don't pass it by...,"This is quite the good story. Apart from Anthony's usual fixation on large breasts and illicit sex and his predilection for justifying the most villianous of characters, this story makes for outstanding light reading. I enjoyed it: don't let the above rating fool you."
2,Pleasant Imitation of the Arabian Nights,"Anthony admits in ""Bio of an Ogre"" that a lot of his fantasy inspiration is from the Arabian Nights. Here he tries a similar story in his style. You are better off buying The Arabian Nights in an unexpurgated edition -- yes, that means that when the hero sneaks into the harem, he really does it with the ladies. Its easy to see that Anthony's bold sexual themes derive from the inspiration of his source. However, the book lacks a certain dimensionality to the characters, as if this is an early work when he was an uncertain writer. I don't remember much of the story or plot, and that says it all -- its a throwaway imitation. Get the original source!"
4,Good sound for rear speaker and I love the dual channel,"I just bought two of these in August '11. Although I have not fine-tuned my receiver for the rear, surround speakers, I can say that this speaker sounds good. If I am just playing music with my receiver set to ""stereo,"" I get a nice, clean, clear sound. It definitely projects the sound well. I bought these to give myself a 7.x surround without having to buy two extra speakers. This comes with two channels, so, I run the Left or Right in one channel and then the rear Left or Right in the other."
3,not recommended for center channel,"although mfg. lists 100-20,000 response +-3db..this speaker is too bright for a single/center channel. I bought for price, components,design and build quality which are above average.BTW, polk and definitive have similar models. Crossover modification does improve the sound similar to my tsi 100 front channels. Suggest staying with polk center unless you like to tweek for fun....combining two channels may be o.k.but I dont see how that improves sound quality."
1,Never had a chance,"After reading great things about BIC speakers and the great sound these speakers had I decided to get a pair to use as my rear speakers. After ordering them I was telling every on how great I hope they sound and could not wait for them to come (I used next day shiping). The next day my new speakers arrive and sooo pumped, I open the box and can hear somthing moving arond inside, my heart had a bad feeling, sure nuff as I look at the speaker both tweeters are missing and I can hear and fell them in the speaker as I tilt it from side to side. At this point i am mad but as I open the second one BAM it is missing one tweeterand it too is inside the speaker. I would have liked to have gotten the chance to hear the sound but they are on the way back to amazon. Oh well you win some you lose some ,today I lost big time."
5,The best Uruk-Hai figure out there!,"Ugluk is the highlight of this pack,while pippin is just a repainted version of the one from the Merry & Pippin vs Moria Orc pack Ugluk is a all new figure,Ugluk is movie accurate,comes with a sword and a whip and is very well painted,he has many pints of articulation and that's never bad.If you like the character Ugluk and/or the Uruk-Hai(like me)this is a must buy,but buy it just for Ugluk and Ugluk only."
3,con games and LA crime,"This movie is one of those fast action fast talking filmslike a Paul Newman con/ hustle film. You never know who is going to get his until the very end. Dustin Huffman isn't as believable as the bad crime bossas you might think he should be, but Rachel Weisz and Edward Burns deliver the plot.The end leaves you wondering if the people involved won't begin to come back at them in the future?"
1,Lurch,"I am ashamed of Dustin Hoffman for participating in this trash. Apparently the director thinks this tired formulae is interesting if it uses the ""F"" word often enough. After all these years ""The Sting"" is still the best of the ""Con"" genre."
5,Incredible Movie!,"""CONfidence"" is a brilliant movie that will leave you wanting more. Edward Burns (as well as the rest of the cast) gives a flawless performance. This is one of my favorite movies and one that I reach for to watch over and over again. I highly recommend this movie to all the Edward Burns fans out there."
5,WOW!,"i had been waiting so long for this movie to be released on dvd, since it had not been playing at a theatre in my area. The wait is finally over, and i was not disappointed. A spectacular con film, comparable to the sting or ocean's 11, with the twists of the usual suspects. i'm confident that you will like it."
4,Stunning script with some peaks and lows!,"James Foley has made a very interesting film around the well known bunch of sympathetic and high level ruffians who play hard for the money, product of a request of a major gangster.Admirable and frenetic camera handle in the first third part of the film, acts a boomerang against the script because it permeates the drama 's intensity. Edward Burns was OK, but I think this character was perfect to Gary Oldman.Rachel Weisz as the femme fatale is wondrous; and Hoffman pitifully does not convince at all in this role."
3,Conning itself.,"Flat headed heist movie that lacks the goods to con itself. Ed Burns does have the chops to pull off his character well, but he comes up short next to his fellow actors, and a very bad script. Dustin Hoffman is great for the very small time that he is in it. And Rachel Weisz outdoes them both with a great performance that the screenplay does not even try to capitalize. Doug Jung's script is really not a script at all but a series of blatantly rip off material from better con films, and a poorly done rip off at that. The DVD itself is better than the movie, and that's because you can see how bad the screenwriter had dropped the ball with this film.See it for Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and Ed Burns's performances, but don't expect a coherent plot."
4,Fun to Watch - Buy It,"I've seen this movie on cable several times and have enjoyed it each time. Not so much for the plot, although it's not bad, but more for the cast. They're all fun to watch. Even Dustin Hoffman's overacting is a fun ride, and the minor characters are a treat. If you don't expect high art and are in the mood for a good story with compelling actors, you won't be disappointed. How can you argue with Ed Burns, Paul Giamatti, Andy Garcia, and the always very beautiful Rachel Weisz in the same film? The scenes with Burns and Hoffman are especailly good, and the chemistry between Burns and Weisz is for real. Well shot, well paced, well acted, and ""Clocks"" over the ending credits is a very nice touch. Very well done. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Been There, Done That","It seems that con movies are a hit nowadays, at least after the sucess of the overrated ""Oceans Eleven"". ""Confidence"" is just another one, a competent, mildly entertaining flick with some style and a lot of hipness to make for the lack of an original and enticing plot. As far as entertainment value goes, there`s much worse, given that the acting is actually decent (even if the characters are cardboard), the soundtrack is alright and director James Foley manages to deliver some flashy camera angles. But frankly, that`s about it. The story is another one about a group of clever grifters and it even has a surprise twist at the end. Unexpected, heh? Well, this should do to kill a couple of hours, nonetheless..."
3,Good con but not too great.,"It's a decent movie but the con is something that we have all seen before, and that is a very huge problem for a con movie to be out con by its predictability. Even so, Rachel Weisz and Dustin Hoffman keep things together with two great performances that make this film a real hoot, and Ed Burns does a good job for a change. Paul Giamatti is great as well, and the rest of the casts follow suit.Just do not expect to be wowed."
4,A terrific consemble!,"A delightful, stylish movie featuring an ace ensemble pulling a twisty caper. Confidence makes the Ocean movies feel utterly self-conscious: ""Look at us! Huge stars being cool!"" It's amazing that Edward Burns carries this film as well as he does, and he does. The supporting cast is simple brilliant; kudos to the casting director. Dustin Hoffman is just wonderfully edgy: brutal here, sensual there, with a comic undercurrent throughout. Sensational. Andy Garcia, barely recognizable in a 5 day growth of beard, shades and a cigar, manages to deliver the Garcia goods so you see it's him even though you can't tell it's him at first. Rachel Weisz manages to play it unaffected for a change. It's nice to see her being directed out of her ""Aren't I precious"" mannerisms. Production design is always colorful and the editing lively. The music is really nicely done. Foley scrambles a variety of genre elements into an eminently watchable picture."
3,Fast-paced and never boring. But I just didn't care.,"This 2003 film didn't stay in the theaters long and I can understand why. Starring Edward Burns and Rachel Weisz, its all about the confidence game. Everyone is conning everyone else and the audience is kept in perpetual mystery about what is truth and what is fiction. I've seen this theme dealt with before but it's usually done better. Even a small role by Dustin Hoffman, cast as a bad guy, doesn't help. The fact is that I just didn't care about the characters. And, after a few minutes, I knew enough not to believe any of it. The film did hold my interest, however, and was never boring. And the stars were nice to look at. But there are so many better films around that I just have one thing to say. Why bother?"
2,Low-rent caper film,"The Bottom Line:Between the lackluster plotting, anemic acting (with the exception of Dustin Hoffman, who's a little annoying but certainly not boring) and the sad feeling of the film merely going through the motions, Confidence gives potential viewers almost no reason to watch the film when there are many far better movies about con men (e.g. The Sting, The Spanish Prisoner, House of Games, even Matchstick Men) out there.2/4"
3,WELL-MADE MOVIE OF A STORY YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD/SEEN,"A good film with oodles of same old grifter-movie themes -- The Heist, The Score, Ocean's Eleven, The Prime Gig..Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia have little more than extended cameos: Garcia never even changes clothes and Hoffman wears two shirts. A couple days' work, tops, for each, and it shows. A special mention for fine character actor Paul Giamatti (son of the late baseball commissioner) -- the best lines and best performance are his. Edward Burns looks more and more like Ben Affleck's twin brother every outing.The standout of this ensemble cast though is Rachel Weisz who not only makes this film but gives it a touch of fun and class that it really does not deserve.All the actors do their jobs but the predictability factor is stretch a little too far, and the con is really something we have all seen before.Recommended rental perhaps."
2,Tepid at best heist movie that has more style than brains,"Tepid at best heist movie that has more style than brains. Ed Burns does a great job as the lead here but is let down by a script that ultimately disappoints in every way possible. Dustin Hoffman is great in a role that we never have seen him do before but with only fifteen minutes of screen time, he fails to make an impact. To say that Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film is an understatement because she is the best thing about it. She not only upstages her fellow actors with her strong performance but also really gives this movie the only spark of smarts the film really has. Which is an amazing thing with a script that falls flat on its face.A good rental but nothing more."
2,The pieces of the puzzle just don't fit,"One way to satisfy your movie audience is to give them a nice surprise ending. Unfortunately, vetrans of this genre may see the ""surprise"" coming long before it is officially due. And once the oh-I-didn't-see-that-one-coming trap is sprung, you don't want to look too closely at how the pieces of the puzzle fit together; cause they don't. Interstingly, a tag line of the movie is that con games don't hold up if closely scrutinized. The writers should have taken their own advice.For a great example of the con game genre check out ""House of Games"", starring Joe Mantegna. It's a great ride, with a cohesive, keeps-you-guessing plot."
2,Predictable!,"As soon as you see the first con you know that the rest of the movie will be full of them, and that what seems obvious will be anything but. That has become almost a cliché for this genre. The smooth talking leader, the nerdy number two man, the seemingly dumb operative and, of course, the lovely young woman.A crass version of an updated cross between Mission Impossible and The Sting without the sophistication. The Dustin Hoffman character was also a cliché, a disgusting inhuman type. It was impossible to feel anything for any of these people, and the story and progress of the movie left me cold. A mindless attempt at entertainment at best."
1,I did not enjoy it whatsoever,Ok. I go to a high school and my theology teacher had this bright idea of using this book as a text book because he was not SATISFIED with the regular one. Reading this book has made me sick to the stomach. The tough questions lead the way to extremely vague answers. Calling them answers is a compliment. Do yourself a favor and do not pick up this book!!
1,Philosophy for the mentally-deficient,"My sister recently lent me this book to read. Just let me say one thing- ""I have not, and will not, ever read so much babble over nothing!"" The babble between the two is so flat and predictable, it gets tedious. Kreeft is such a horrible author. I cannot NOT recommend this book any more than I already have.. Buy it if you are having trouble sleeping.PS.. as for the reader who thinks a person has so much free time as to write multiple reviews, YOU ARE PARANOID !"
5,Interesting style and insightful points,"The dialogue between a christian and an athiest is very interesting to read. In this dialogue the athiest is slowly won over to Christianity, but Peter Kreeft does so logically: the athiest does not easily surrender any points made, his conversion, while gradual, makes sense. I recommend this book to anyone from 12-40 (or anyone learning to share the faith)as it is a solid read, but is not as intellectually 'deep' as some of his other books."
5,Works Great,"This device provides the needed information about your home while you are away. We had a power outage at ""home"" and it called our cell phone 3 times, eventually stopping calls when power was resumed. A great investment!!"
4,"Easy enough to set up, but needs an improvement to instructions.","I found the product easy to set up for the basic functions I cared about- calling 3 phone numbers when there is a power outage or temperature drop at my cottage. It does this as advertised- I'll need to own it for a while to evaluate reliability. If OK, I'll get another for my home and include the flooding alarm function for the basement sump. The manual needs better explanation of the feature for seizing the phone line. The manual does not explain how to implement this function in terms useful to the average customer and refers the reader to the company website, which also lacks this explanation. I consider this minor, in my case, since this is not a burglar alarm that needs such a feature, but it might irritate someone who wants to use this feature."
2,DOA,"Arrived w/ dead 9V battery, which was a pain since I was hooking this thing up & trying to get packed for vacation @ about the same time. One of the wires was too short to connect so I just left everything in the box & headed out for vacation. I'm out $99 but at least I'm laying on the beach!"
4,easy to install and seems to work as advertised,"I set up the unit fairly easily and decided to test it, at least for a power outage. It was a little slow dialing but it did call my cell phone. I haven't tested it for temperature yet.People who use a cable company for their phone service should take note: be sure you have a modem with battery backup. If not, get one. Otherwise your phone will not work and no one will be notified by this device."
4,Snowbirds can use this device,"The only reason for 4 stars was that 9V battery that came with the unit was discharged. A flashing red light indicates battery is low.This is a great product for those Northerners that spend four or five months away from their principal residence and want alerted in the event of a power or furnace failure. Keep in mind that you must use this device with a telephone land line. If you do not have dependable telephone service there is still a point of failure. The device can be programmed to call up to three numbers.I tested a cell phone; there is a test feature built in, and it worked fine. You will need to get the cooperation of relatives or friends to know what to do if alerted. Instruction cards are included.The setup of the device is simple and a website address is provided where you can watch a video of the setup."
2,Death & the Jubilee (Lord Francis Powerscourt),"I have read a number of David Dickinson's books but found this the least appealing of all of them. There appeared to me to be too much 'formula' about this book. I could almost anticipate the unfolding of the plot as it went along. I also found the characters most unconvincing. I'm glad I bought the ebook version and not the real book, which I had done previously for the others."
1,Returning it soon.,"Just received this organizer. It comes in several colors which I was hoping to use to differentiate products. It was a little smaller than many of the organizers with this many compartments, but would have worked for me had it been built more robust.For my use the lid is too flimsy and the latches don't hold very well. One use I had was to store #4-#10 bolts, nuts, washers, etc. & then set it upright on a shelf or in a tool bag to carry to jobs. #4-#6 washers are pretty small & thin and the way the lid flexes I think they would migrate from their intend compartment.There are 6 compartment dividers included but there are 9 positions that accept dividers. Seems a waste not to add 3 more dividers. However, at least on the unit I received the center front compartment was so warped that the divider would not have stayed in place anyway.The biggest issue is I would not trust the latches to remain secured especially in a tool bag."
1,No warranty or manufacturer guarantee,"I purchased this item 6 months ago. It worked fine for 4 months but in the fifth month I lost all sound. The item was not dropped nor was it ever played vey loud. In fact I would say it was only played about 35-40 hours total! Upon calling tech support, I was told ""Unfortunately it does seem as if the product has developed some kind of fault,(sic) please note that this product is usually very reliable and this seems to be a one of unit(sic) from the thousands that we sell.""""I would advise that you take the faulty unit back to the initial point of purchase for an exchange, providing it is under the retailers guarantee and that you do have proof of purchase.""Translation: Tough luck and too bad. We are shifting all responsibility to Amazon!"
1,Unimpressed - Terrible sound quality and distortion,"I bought one for my daughter as a Christmas gift. Returned the first one due to poor sound quality and distortion. Amazon was great and shipped another one next day. Unfortunately the sound quality of the second unit was as bad as the first. I do not understand the reviews that this system receives, the only positive id the design. If you keep the volume down there is no noticeable distortion, but if you want to use this device to listen to music at a comfortable sound level than you are wasting your money. Very disappointing product."
1,Horrible sound......distortion,"I purchased this item from a big box store and was very disappointed in the sound quality. Distortion from the minute that it was hooked up. Obviously I had a defective unit, maybe a nondefective unit would have been acceptable at the time. I was not willing to take a chance on a replacement, so I did some research and purchased the Zvox Mini. Blows all the made for ipod speakers out of the water. Sure, I will have to buy a dock to charge my ipod...but I have QUALITY sound...not the hollow and tinny sounding music I have heard from other units. Cannot say enough about the Zvox...check it out-zvoxaudio.com.......many published reviews included on their website."
1,Doesn't fit iPod Photo,"Bought it for my just purchased iPod photo but the hole in which the iPod is supposed to plug in is not wide enough. Don't know if the iPod photo is larger or what. But I had to return this item. It looks really slick, and I wish it did fit my iPod photo."
4,Okay sound,"For the price, the station does exactly what it needs to do. I plays with a relatively strong sound and it charges the I-pod when on the dock. Compared to all the other pricey stations, this one did the trick unless you are really picky about sound and use it in home, office or parties all the time."
1,a terrible piece of junk,"i ordered this based on positive reviews that i read, here and elsewhere. however, when i got it, i could not believe the terrible sound and really cheap production quality of this machine. it's a total piece of junk--i would not pay 10 dollars for it, let alone over 80! mine is on it's way back to amazon for a refund."
5,really cute,I bought this item for my son's birthday and I find myself using it every opportunity I get. The sound is quite good considering the price. I just get a real kick out of being able to hear the music I painstakingly put on my ipod without having headphones on or having to hold it. My son has the ipod with video capacity and has used it for that purpose. Basically a great product for the price. It's not a Bose but then I haven't paid a Bose price.
3,I liked this a lot better the first month,"I liked this product a lot the first month. It has a great form factor: fold it up for the suitcase, then unfold it for the hotel desk on business trips. And the sound is pretty good.But my i-station did not hold up well. It now rattles on certain frequencies. And I used to use it as an alarm clock, setting the ipod to awake with music at a certain time, and leaving the i-station on. No longer: now when the ipod is off, my i-station emits a low purr, loud enough to keep me awake."
2,Not worth buying,"For portable speakers for an iPod, this is an alright buy. However, after i had caried it to 2 or 3 places, and i made sure it was packed tightly so nothing would mess up, i found out that the AC adapter stopped functioning. This was bad because now I am left with speakers that can only play with batteries. Another problem with this speaker system is that its ""3D surround sound processor"" is not very good. No matter how close I am to the speakers, I do not change the 3D setting because it sounds the same, if not worse, as the normal setting. There isn't much point to buying specific speakers for an iPod anymore because Apple has come out with an iTrip costing $20-$25. This small device plugs into the iPod and boardcasts the iPod's music onto a radio nearby very easily. All the listener needs is a radio, and this will cost far less than the speakers. So i recomend not purchasing this, and just purchasing an iTrip if you want to hear your iPod on portable speakers."
3,Some unresolved issues,"I would rate higher but I have some unresolved issues. On the positive side I find the sound to be pretty decent considering the size. It is also nice that the unit is able to act as a fully functioning docking station and comes with USB, Firewire and external power brick included as part of the price. It is a nice looking accessory that matches the iPod design and curves well.On the negative side I get static through the iStation speakers whenever my iPod spins up to reload cache memory. This only happens when running off external power. It is fine whenrunning on battery power. The static is quite noticeable on my 3G 40Gb iPod. It is not nearly as bad on a mini-iPod I borrowed for a test.I sent an email to Logic3 support at www.logic3.com (UK) asking if there were any simple solutions but have not received any response after a week."
4,Great sound for a great price,I am very happy with the Logic3 i-station dock and speaker station. I bought it to use on our boat and it serves the purpose well
2,"Nice look, awful sound","Comes with firewire and USB cables, nice and compact, but the soundis awful. Too bad it looks cute. The amp clips even at modest volumes, the speakers vibrate and sound tinny"
1,should have listened to the bad reviews,"This thing worked for a total of 50 minutes. I bought it for work, and when I recieved it, I took it out of the box and made sure it worked, and it did. I took it to work 2 days later and it turned out to be a piece of junk. No sound came out unless I played around with the middle speaker and had it sit just right; then, after about 45 minutes, the sound was lost alltogether and I couldn't get it back. I'm going to a retail store tomorrow to get a different one that I can take back right away (if I have to) instead of waiting 2-6 weeks to send mine in and get fixed."
5,Turn your Ipod into a personal radio station ANYWHERE,"FOr the price of this, I am extrememly happy!!!I use it almost everyday.I love that I can add batteries or plug it in.I have not used the battery feature yet.It was important for me to have a system that I can use FREE of a stereo. I can listen to all of MY favorite music, in the kitchen, the upstairs, the basement.. ANYWHERE!It is a nice compact size for the countertop.AS mentioned before it is not the BEST sound system you could buy but it sure does a decent job In my opinion.This will probably end up being a camping staple as well.DISTORTION TIPS:I had to add this due to the bad reviews...A) dont plan on playing it full blast, I mean who really needs to play things that loud?B AND MOST IMPORTANT turn down the volume on the IPOD itself all the way. It makes big difference as to what volume the distrotion will start...."
4,really decent speakers - great travel item,"These are really decent speakers for travel and for using when you don't need maximum volume, I like having the option of batteries and electricity. I use them in my kitchen while cooking, take them on trips for use in hotel rooms or to the beach for music outdoors.Good design, easy to pack and they charge your ipod too."
4,Good Buy for the Price,"I should say that I am happy with the purchase so far. The speaker system works as described and the sound range on the speaker is also appreciable. It encourages me to actually use my Ipod video to watch movies. Earlier, even though I have a 5th generation Ipod, I used it largely for audio only purpose. But now, I am using it for watching Videos as well. At a close range, it makes a personal video system on the table or on the lap. On Batteries, it does not run very long but I don't consider it as a problem as I use the DC adopter a lot.I would have given it 5 stars had it also charged the batteries ( it charges the Ipod but I am talking about the Unit batteries )while running on external power. But, I guess that is asking for too much.You don't get an auditorium filling sound range from this little unit but for an office room or for a family room, this is sufficient. This is also a great party jukebox for family parties."
2,Poor sound quality,"I asked for the i-Station for Christmas and when I got it, I found that although it's a nice-looking speaker system and very easy to use, the sound quality is incredibly poor. Even using the ""3D"" option, it was like I was listening to music in a tunnel. The sound was very muffled - I get much better quality just hooking my iPod into my computer. It's a nice product, but not worth the money if you're looking for a good sound."
2,i can't recommend it,"it was cheap. it plays my ipod. it sounds very tinny.i would spend a little more and get better sound next time. i didn't think the poor quality would bother me, but it does and i find myself not docking my i pod in my office (where the dock is located) as often as i would if the sound were great."
5,Too Cool!,"Ok- so everyone has an iPod now... that's cool. But do they have awesome sound that you can share their tunes with everyone? iStation has great sound, and is easy to travel with. I take it on business trips (it slips nicely into my carry-on bag)and listen to tunes in the hotel room. It takes up so little space, I take it back/forth from office to home, where I can synch and charge all at once. On the weekends, iStation works great on the boat. My kids loved it so much, my daughter had to have one for her dorm room, and my teenager at home uses it in her bedroom.I never run out of battery time now... every time I put the iPod in the cradle, it gets a charge.My neighbor has speakers from a competitive brand- he gets no charge and the sound output is not a great as my iStation. I'm thrilled with this buy! And best of all, it costs less than the competition!"
3,"Good sound, OK value","In my search for a nice travel speaker system for my laptop and preferably Ipod compatible (as far as charging and syncing), I took the I-station for a test-drive and compared it to a friend's Altec Lansing InMotion system.I thought the sound quality from the I-station system was good - especially for the size. The InMotion system did sound quite a bit better - much more presence and nearly matching the bass response even without the ""subwoofer"".I was dissappointed in the fold-up design with the separate plastic cover.Overall, given the choice between this at $80 and the InMotion at its original price of $150, I would choose this. But now I see the InMotion for $110. I think that it is definately worth the $30 for the InMotion's better sound and slick fully protected fold-up design. However, I'm still looking at other systems."
4,"iStation combines portability and ease of use, with some limitations","I received this speaker system for Christmas. Recognizing that is indeed one of the ""lower-end"" speaker systems made for iPod out there, it is actually pretty good for the price. Though the sound is sometimes distorted when turned up very loudly, this speaker does exactly what I need it to do. It is nice because I can set my iPod's alarm, turn up the speakers, and, without any buzzing sound or anything, wake up to my music. I have a 5G iPod with video, and it works perfectly (just make sure to put the plastic cover that fits over the speakers on the back so the iPod doesn't move back when you select something.) Otherwise, works great right out of the box. Wish there was a remote. Recommended!"
4,Solid choice for the money,"I was pleasantly surprised at the sound output of the iStation. Its sound can easily fill a room, which surprised me based on its size. My only complaint is that at high volumes it starts to distort, but I guess that's to be expected. The unit is put together quite well and has an excellent look. Also, the battery option will come in handy for listening on the boat or in an office.Overall, I'm satisfied and would recommend this unit if you want good performance for under $100."
5,Very user friendly,"I used this to create estimates, then it lets you transfer that estimate right to an invoice. Very user friendly, It keeps track of all the invoices for future use, so you can see what the customer paid on a yearly basis, no need to upgrade very useful for small businesses or handyman type businesses."
2,The first six hours were great!,"When I purchased this item my main worry was that my ipod was going to slip off it while I drove (since my job envolves driving around on very bumpy surfaces all night) and although that was a mild problem, I put a rubber band around it and moved on. It was working great. It allowed me to listen to my own music while I worked. Then somewhere about six hours into working and listening, it just got really staticy. Even in places that it worked before it was now unlistenable. Even in my personal vehicle (which it worked fine on, on the way to work) now sounded horrible.So like it says in the title, the first six hours of use of this product were wonderful, its the next six that were miserable and made me think that I just wasted fourty dollars on something that only worked for six hours.I will let it sit for a while and try again tommorow at work, if it works then, I will take it all back, if not, then I stand by this being a waste of money, and I will return it."
3,A good book,"The fifth book in this series basically brings all of what you learned in the previous books together with some new features. The beginning of this book is dedicated to character types, their common facial features, clothing, etc. The bulk of this book is dedicated to clothing including school uniforms, nightwear, job uniforms, beachwear, skiwear, kung fu costumes, and many more. They also go into small details such as bags, shoes, and guns.That said, I must say that I really didn't get as much out of this book as I did the other ones. Everything was basically explained in more detail in the previous books. This does give you nice clothes and character types, but you can also come up with that stuff on your own. It's up to you."
4,Expressions and Body Language Anime Tutorial,"This book is great for the intermediate to advanced Manga artist who specifically wants to improve facial expression, body poses and body language, gestures, mannerisms and key compositions to create anime movement and action. The book covers an array of distinctive facial expressions with many characters. Dress, uniforms and costumes are well covered to help create a particular persona.I was told that this is the best book for beginners. I simply searched for the title. I now realise this is volume 5 and it's too advanced for me. As a beginner look out for the previous volumes."
3,Ho-Hum,"1st of all, this book isnt for begginers, so if youre starting out read something else, since you need a bit of expereince.this book was only ok, i suppose it might be of greater help to someone who is in the video game biz.I still have the same problem with this book as i had with all the other how to draw anime and game charaters books--the characters are generic.the girls seem a bit stale,cuz truly great games and anime and manga dont use these girls-- they use more original people.that isnt to say it isnt a bad book, it isnt.you will find many hints and tips.hope this helps."
4,Good medium size bag,Great deal w/ the battery! The bag seems to be just slightly larger than the camera. I use it to hold one additional lense and small flash for my dSLR. It will not hold more than 2 lenses.
5,d40x acessory package,"the bag works great, battery fits,book is good and I would purchas this package again"
1,Beware - item shipped not as shown!!! (UPDATED),"Before purchasing this I looked at it in a local store. Bag was just like the photo shown here on Amazon. Price at the local store was $99. So, I bought one from Amazon for $60. Was excited, even with the free Super Saver shipping I got it 2 days later! Then I opened the box, and found the bag was not as shown, or as I saw it in the local store. The bag is black with a yellow trim piece. It is a square bag with SMALL side pockets. Useless. Don't know if they are shipping an old version or a newer version, but its not what's shown and not what's in stores. I returned mine.UPDATED: The photo now shown is the correct photo of what they send you. Still confused why this kit in the stores (with same model number) has a bigger and nicer bag. Never-the-less, the bag shown here is too small and useless for the D40 with any accessories or additional lenses."
2,"Be aware, there might be two versions","when I purchased this item, I noticed one of the review said the bag is rather small, with yellow strip not as shown in picture. But some other said the bag can hold everything. I guess there might be two version. I got the version with yellow strip. The extra battery is nice but the quality of bag is average. It is too small for 18-200 nikon lens. When I come back to amazon to write the review, the picture of product is removed from the web."
3,What you see is NOT what you get!!,"I bought this bag when they had a picture on the website. After I received the bag, i was amazed to see that its not what I ordered. I was very dissapointed when I received the package, however i have not returned it yet. The bag is Ok, the book is not a great help. I guess, the bag is adequate if you dont plan to buy additional lens, flash rightaway."
5,"Love it, and so does my kid!","Got this cot two days ago. Shipping took only one week and it arrived in perfect condition. Yes, assembly requires a bit of time, but all instructions are very clear and easy to follow. didn't have a single problem during assembly: my husband finished it in about 30 minutes and all parts fit perfectly. It looks very well made, bright and fun! Our two-year-old loves it. He spends all the time playing in it and slept real well in it for two nights already. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
5,Perfect for the growing boy.,This was a Christmas gift for my 17 month old boy who had well out grown the crib. He loves it. Perfect size for his age and he likes to play on it as well. Delivery was quick. Great for any child who's out grown the crib.
5,Love it!,"With the second baby coming in a couple of months, we wanted to get our 21 month old son something fun to sleep on. As soon as he saw the box, he was excited. He begged us to open it right away and we had to put it together that night. The assembly wasn't too hard. He has been sleeping very well on this bed for a month now. He doesn't miss his crib at all! We actually bought this bed from Toysrus website - it is cheaper at $ 89.99 and was delivered within two weeks."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,The bed looks very nice.. [...] when you have a toddler who is starting to climb out of their crib..This probably won't make it in the reviews but I'm writing it anyway.
3,Nice Toddler bed but exhausting to put together,"The bed is adorable once your finished. The instructions are not detailed at all! They are literally just pictures and the front piece with the window and top light are four different pieces that only join together by screwing in the side pieces. So I had to hold all four pieces on top of each other or I should say balance all four, and by the time I was screwing in the last screw the holes didn't line up and the pin ended up breaking because of the pressure between the wooden slabs. I am not so strong to have broken this myself. I am very handy when it comes to tools and installing products. This bed just has a poor design. My son loves the bed and that's all that matters now."
1,unreliable company,"I purchased this fire truck bed for my son when the company Lucky kid's had it for a low sales price. Me and my son both were very excited to get this bed, ordered bedding for it and have his room ready to put it in, only to find out that the company Lucky kid's canceled my order with no explanation, except to reorder the bed if I so desire. What kind of company does not honor a price they had listed whether it be a mistake or not. I would not recommend doing business with such an unreliable company. I am now left with bedding for my fire truck bed and no bed."
2,Touches my heart & soul,Am about to order more of this book -- it is right on for me & those friends on the spiritual path. I can so identify. I feel like this woman knows me & I know her -- especially appreciate the references as well. Opened my mind to a new view of my life & our times. Thank you Cheryl!! More...
2,In a word -- T-H-I-N.,"I should have known -- when the lines are so spaced apart, the print large, and the book still thin, there may not be much in the book. There are exceptions, for sure, but not this one. I agree 100% with the resentful reviewer -- and am most grateful I got the book as a bonus and didn't pay retail for it. Doesn't even seem like a ""rehash"" to me -- sometimes they make you rethink some things -- this one does only skimming on the surface. Skip it."
5,"How to anticipate, recognize, & use these moments of 'grace'","Author Cheryl Richardson maintains in Unmistakable Touch Of Grace that examples of grace in action - coincidences which point the way to better paths in life - are all around us. These examples enable viewers to make changes, recognize instruments of spiritual change, and enact transformations in behavior and lifestyle. Unmistakable Touch Of Grace is dedicated to showing readers how to anticipate, recognize, and use these moments of 'grace' to further positive changes. Case histories demonstrate how others have achieved valuable changes from recognizing - and using - grace. Unmistakable Touch Of Grace is highly recommended reading for anyone seeking to enhance the spiritual grace of their own daily lives."
5,THE Best Book!,"I cannot express what a eye opening and wonderful book this is. Read it, I don't know how a person honestly wanting to enhance their relationship with their spiritual side and God could not be affected by this book.SO much can be gained by just paying attention to what God DOES give us in our lives. As suggested I started journaling, however I only did short writings at first. But putting it down on paper helps you to take notice of when God answers your prayers. Otherwise we seem to forget as the thoughts just drift in and out of our mind. And He DOES answer.This book will help you to see Grace in your life. Seeing grace in your life gives you hope, lets you know that you are not alone, that God does hear you and does answer your prayers.I very highly recommend this book to anyone searching, possibly feeling hopeless with life. It doesn't solve your problems for you, but it does help you find hope in knowing and trusting that God is there, and on your side."
5,Cheryl's Message Is Her Presence,"This is a powerful book. Cheryl has captured the magic of grace and shares with all of us its universal generosity. I have long admired her contributions and her authenticity as an author, speaker and coach. She has had a positive impact on thousands of lives through the written word, on television and with clients.Through this book she opens herself up in such a wonderful way we can all recognize our shared humanity. I recently interviewed Cheryl on my television program ""Chicagoing"" on WLS-TV ABC7-Chicago. Our conversation not only reflected her personal grace but conveyed her undestanding of life's most exquisite gift.In the book she states that she has learned that her ""message is her presence."" This book is a personification of that powerful truth. She is an absolute conduit of grace. Her latest contribution makes that quite clear."
3,Multicoloured samples = funky summer lushness,"'Since I Left You' is an electronica landmark, a no-holds-barred approach to samples and sounds, creating for funky summer lushness. The Avalanches' debut is a dense recording in the same way Da Bomb Squad is dense, but instead of avant-garde noise, it's more about creating summer radiance, sparkling brilliance. Just think 'Bitches Brew' meeting 'Three Feet High And Rising' by De La Soul. After awhile though, this continuous sample-fest (yes there are no breaks) drags-on a bit, the impression that samples were randomly thrown together, almost like audio-babble, the more overdubs the better. But on the otherhand, there is no sense of overkill and chaos, creating for a lighthearted ambience, with a beat-driven backbone holding this multicoloured-cocktail together. What else can be said? 'Since I Left You' exhibits musical vision, and most importantly, you can dance to it."
2,Boring...,"I bought this cd because I had heard ""Frontier Psychiatrist."" When I first put the cd on, I was elated because it opens well. Starting with ""Since I Left You"" and continuing for exactly four tracks, it was delightful, danceable, and reminded me of my childhood. From that point on, though, it becomes one long, frenetic conversation. There are some interesting samples, but they are put together weird, and it is way too repetetive for its own good. The best thing about this cd is that fact that you can put a few songs on a great mix cd. That's it."
5,cheeky little remixes of samples = one awesome party album!!,"The Avalanches - a couple of Australian dj / mixing scamps, brings us one of the sunniest, most eclectic, most off-beat party albums in years. Culled entirely from samples, it has to be heard to be believed. It's a non-stop bizarro dance fest, complete with neighing horses (somehow, it works). The single 'frontier psychiatrist' is a jaw-dropping riot. If you like house beats with fun, this is the ultimate party album. It's definitely different - but well worth it."
4,Like a slow moving car through a fast moving city.,"Ok, so the my titles dumb, but still its pretty much the first thought that came to my head after listening to this CD. Have you ever been driving slowly through a city at night with bits of coversation, music and random sounds coming through the window? Or have you ever been in a room where you could heard two different songs playing at the same time... and suddenly they seem to mesh and actually work together? These are the types of sensations this CD invoked for me. Some people have complained about that some of the samples are too recognizable, but much like being in that slow moving car, thats part of the appeal to me.... Needless to say I like the CD."
3,madmen across the serengeti,"After all the hype, I threw up a caution flag to purchasing this disk, but after it became available domestically at a bargain, I gave in. You'd think these guys had been locked up in a steam room with an insurance salesman; this plethora of continuous samples is nuttier than an east Texas fruit cake. It's remarkably cohesive, melodic, fluid, and frisky. Whatever they lack in technique and knowledge, it's richly supplemented with enthusiasm and spirit. Their heads and hearts are definitely in ""the right place"" as this is the stuff legends are made of. Nestled comfortably between downtempo and dancefloor, I'd clock this in at 7:00 a.m. A great way to start the day and keep it going. It wears a tad thin in places, but shines overall for one-of-a-kind originality. Talk about down south. Just get down."
4,Prowess and spirit,"Technical prowess in the realm of Shadow's Entroducing or Caldato's work on Paul's Boutique meets the sheer joy of rocking it, a al Fatboy. These boys should work on a dj mix collection, as this record itself feels almost as if it's constructed like a downtempo/leftfield set. Immensely appealing."
3,Gorgeaous Single in a Frustrating Album,"Of course the title song is a great single, one of the best of the year, infectious, almost worth buying the whole album for. But there's a lot of repetition-infected disco songs here, some of which are quite irritating.Should you buy this CD? Tough call. I bought the popular Moby CD from a year ago because I loved a single on it, but I haven't played Moby in several months. I fear the same will happen with ""Since I Left You."""
2,i haven't heard anybody mention this...,"I purchased this disc after being barraged by the countless 4 star magazine reviews and on-line user reviews calling it the greatest sampling lp since ""Paul's Boutique"". While I do hear a lot of work went into the production, the one thing that stands out for me about this record is the incredibly poorly mastering. I understand that much of the sampling came from vinyl, but these are the 2000s we're living in, don't these cats own some cleaning programs that can take out all the hiss and fuzz? It's hard to appreciate the samples when it sounds like it's being played back over a bad AM radio station. If you're looking for good food for your hi-fi, skip this one and pick up Lemon Jelly's excellent ""lemonjelly.ky""."
2,Avalanches reducing to snowball...,"Openings can be deceptive...My first exposure to the Avalanches and the title track is a whimsical, sugar-pop delight with the Madonna Holiday sample slotting in to perfection. Unfortunately the remains of the album disappoint as it album dissolves into a mish-mash of over-elaboration and mis-direction. Like me, if you like your oeuvre deconstructed, a little darker and starker, I would suggest any Massive Attack and/or Dummy by Portishead (with the wondrous gloom-diva, Beth Gibbons)."
2,too busy,"The avalanches are all over the place. I just can't listen to this album - it's just too distracting and bothersome. A nice try; good samples and sounds, but the mixing is annoying. I'd like to see what they put out next."
4,How Betty Handles Space,You can't beat a chapter title like that!I enjoyed this book. Made sense to me!
4,Beginner's Bible,"Tapes in very good condition, and prompt mailing, only one problem, I received two wrong tapes. Received Goliah & Noah's Ark in place of ""Mosses & Easter"" They should be more carefull checking when they pack.Thanks Donna"
3,Not quite first rate,"A very good spy story with lots of twists and turns, a love story and the up turning of an unknown son. There is lots of shooting and death for those with a bloody bent and an airplane crash that is the centre of a sabotage investigation. The plot line centres on the competition amongst spy organizations in different countries in the investigation by the UN of an ethnic cleansing burial site in the former Yugoslavia. A nice twist at the end, a believable protagonist in Robert Copeland and a ruthless sadistic enemy that stretches Copeland's many talents.While I enjoyed most of the book the last 100 pages tended to drag and the involvement of the various good and bad guys got very complex. 3.5/5"
4,Henry Porter A Spy's Life,"The English setting is very well done. The story I felt was padded out a little too much. But an enjoyable read, nevertheless."
1,Level is not functioning and packing is even worse,"Got the level today, it has painted surface with 3 plastic components . It was shipped together with two other items (36"" clamps). None of these items were wrapped/protected at all. They collide with each other at one side of the packing box; even though the box is full of packing paper, the packer seems not bother to use it to wrap any of the items. One of the three bubbles is not working on the level and both clamps were visibly bended. Unbelievable."
5,DVD,I bought this DVD for my youngest grandson for a Christmas gift to go with his portable DVD player that I also bought him. He loves Phineas and Ferb and watched all the time.
3,Christmas episode good,The Christmas episode was good but the rest of the shows were all reruns that we have seen before or have on other DVD's.
5,Wish they sold whole seasons...!!,"""Phineas And Ferb: A Very Perry Christmas""------------------------------------------------------------This is a fun TV series, but it's too bad that Disney only has a handful of episodes available on DVD. We don't get cable, so for us it sure would be nice if they'd put out full ""Season One"" and ""Season Two"" collections, rather than just these semi-random DVD releases with only five episodes per disc. Sigh. I'm sure they'll get around to it someday in the distant future, but my kid'll have outgrown the show by then. That being said, this disc includes the Christmas special, which includes one of Dr. Doofenschmirtz's best songs, ""Tell Me Why I Don't Hate Christmas,"" which is ""Phineas And Ferb"" at its best! (Axton)"
2,Good DVD but buyer beware,"I will echo some earlier sentiments and express my disappointment that there is nothing new to this DVD. It's great for any Phineas & Ferb fan, but I probably would not have bought it had it been clear that the Christmas episode is one my kids have seen a number of times. It really was marketed to come across as something all new. I was curious why the box didn't give a more detailed description of the Christmas show and this explains why; people would instantly recognize it's the same episode as seen on TV. Good DVD with a lot of bonus features, but Disney should be a little less ambiguous with their title releases."
5,"Great show, Great DVD with lots of extras","I first watched 'Phineas and Ferb' because my son liked it and I wanted to make sure I knew what kind of shows he was watching. Now I'M hooked, and I am known to watch it by myself too!Because it is such a great show, I would have bought this DVD solely for the Christmas Special alone. However, this DVD is packed with lots of great extras.The DVD cover mentions that it includes a bonus, not yet aired on TV episode, the Doof Side of the Moon. But in addition to that, there are also 4 other episodes:- Interview with a Platypus- Oh There You Are Perry- Chez Platypus- Perry Lays an EggSo that right there makes this a good buy. Add to that some interesting behind the scenes bits, the jukebox-i-nator with the Christmas music from this episode, and few ultimately unimportant but cute easter eggs in the menu. And the virtual fireplace is actually pretty darn cute! So all in all, it's a great show, a fun Christmas special, and you get a lot for your money."
2,Horrible,"It only contains one Christmas movie, and because of that its a waste of money. I was very disappointed with the buy."
1,Not New,"This item came available for pre-order which usually indicates a new release. This is not, it's the Christmas episode from last year along with a few additional old episodes. Nothing wrong with the episodes, the DVD was marketed in such a way as to give the impression of something new or previously unreleased, this is not the case. However, if you don't already own it and/or just love these guys like we do by all means order it."
5,"Style, comfort, quality","This shoe is wonderful, the quality is excellent, they are so pretty on, and really comfortable. I love these shoes. I highly recommend these shoes, you won't be disappointed."
4,A medium sized dictionary of black english phrases,"black english vernacular is medium sized, but i was surprised that there was not a large section on pronounciation. the defintions for the words are too small. it seemed like the defintions were just notes, or references from a larger text."
4,Good review of the fundamentals,"This video takes you through all the basics from flying a trainer kite up to getting on the board. The production is professional and the curriculum is well designed. The only bummer is that the instruction stops when the student gets up on the board, so there is no discussion of board handling, skills, etc. There could be more discussion on the safety aspects. I used it as a supplement/preparation tool for professional lessons and it was excellent when used for this purpose. There is also a helpful bonus section on understanding the different types of gear and what to look for in your first rig. I thought enough of this video that I'm flying cross-country next week to take my intermediate lessons at their facility in Cape Hatteras."
5,Real Evolution Training Video,"This video brakes down every kiteboarding step. Having so much information you can watch it several times and get more out of it each time. Real's other Videos like Zero 2 Hero should also be on your shopping list if your new to the sport. Get all the basics from the videos, however, pay the money for a lesson you will be allot safer and have more enjoyable sessions.Southern EnduranceMississippi"
4,Not to be compared with the BBC series,I loved the BBC series but Caroline Graham's books have moore twists and turns. The characters have a greater depth.
1,Not a Barnaby Book,"My fault, I should have researched this book more before picking up, I thought it was an Inspector Barnaby Book. I was very disappointed, enough so that I didn't finish. The plot was not interesting and the characters was strictly one dimensional. Not very enjoyable reading at all. Don't be put off Caroline Graham by this book though. The rest of her works are outstanding."
2,This wasn't a very good ghost story.,"I bought this book with high hopes after reading everyone's comments here, but when I read it I was very disappointed. it wasn't scary, it wasn't spine-tingling, it didn't make me scared to turn out the lights and go to sleep. The reader never gets a sense of what happened or why. I like ghost stories that can really make you worry when the lights are off, and this one just didn't do it for me."
2,Irritating,"It was somewhat interesting in the beginning... but then the story seemed to go nowhere. I found the characters irritating. I didn't buy them as people. THEN, the book ended about (what I felt was) half way through the story."
2,So So,"I found this book rather boring. If there is a ghost story in this book it is very cleverly hidden. I kept waiting for ghost to appear, and I waited until the very last page and got nothing. I would suggest reading this book only if you can find nothing else to read, but keep your expectations low."
5,"Wonderfully involved, beautifully written tale.",It is obvious that Ms. Hawkes has done her research into the field of parapsychology. This is a largely psychological story of a haunted house told through the eyes of two people who are experts and supposed to be prepared for the supernatural. They got more than they bargained for.Julian's House is resplendant with detail and atmosphere. Highly recommended!
4,A Good Ghost Story,"I bought this book after reading one of the author's other books, The Heart Of A Witch. It is a ghost/poltergeist story. I enjoyed the book, although I don't think it is as good as The Heart Of A Witch. It is definitely in line with a lot of the ""Ghosthunter"" shows that are all over the cable stations these days. If you like those, then you will like this because the young couple who are the hero/heroine of this story, rent a ""haunted house"" in a small town in the hopes of finding imperical, documented proof of a haunting. At first they seem like a happily married couple, but as the book goes on, you see that things are not what they seem in their marriage -- just like in the house. There is a definite parallel there. The book is good, not great. I have the author's third book, My Soul To Keep and I am looking forward to reading that one."
4,HAUNTING AND WELL WRITTEN...A THINKING PERSON'S GHOST STORY,"This is a well crafted, gripping read for those who love ghost stories. Evocative of Henry James' 'The Turning of the Screw', this novel is spellbinding, as the past and the present seem to merge into a new reality.A husband and wife team, parapsychologists by profession, lease a well known haunted house in order to record all paranormal phenomena which may occur during their tenancy. This, however, turns out to be more than they can ultimately handle. The house begins to overwhelm them, and they personally begin a slow metamorphosis over time. Their marriage begins to undergo a change, as well. Whether this is as a result of ghostly manifestations or not, I leave to the reader to decide.Suffice to say, I trust that this beautifully written ghost story will not disappoint the reader."
2,Casino Classics,Casino Classics is a remix album of Saint Etienne and not a very good one. Many tracks sound like overly long extended mixes that just go on and on without aim. The sound of the mixes also sound very 90's and therefore dated. I love Saint Etienne and I usually like remixes but not these. The booklet is alright with well-written liner-notes by Kris Needs and some blurry photographs that seem to have been shot by an amateur. Allmusic gave this remix album 3/5 but to me this is a bit too high. 2/5.
2,Classics......yeah right.....,"This is only worth the money if you don't already have the 2-disc version of ""too young to die"" singles collection. The first disc is the bonus disc that came with the singles collection. Some of the remixes were ok, but there were just too many instrumentals. Most of side two is the same. Most of the remixes bear no resemblance to the original tracks, and seeing as how most of the vocals are also gone, it's really hard to enjoy. If you like extended versions or radically remixed VOCAL remixes, then this is not for you. You'd be better off searching for the individual singles and finding the one vocal remix on them."
4,A fun read,"I really enjoyed this book. Being in the Air Force, it was a look at a different world. I have to give the author a lot of credit because much of the mission he was not able to see, I'm sure, but had to get that information academically, not first hand. It started out a little slow, but picked up once at sea. I enjoyed the fact that some of the flubs were left in, and it wasn't sanitized too much. The book was interesting, and gave me an appreciation of the men who serve aboard these awesome machines. This book is a perfect airplane or trip book for those who like military non-fiction."
3,Not among the best submarine books out there,"I was disappointed in Big Red, which I thought held much promise. The book spent more pages devoted toward freshman-level psychological analysis of various crew members than discussing the details of the mission. I was surprised that such a boring book could result from such fascinating materia."
2,Disappointing...,"Very short on meat. Very long on way too much contrived drama. It wasn't so bad as to make me stop reading, but it wasn't so good that I'd seek out this author again."
3,two very self-reliant boys!,"in 1788,kentucky,young dave starr and his friend,jem mcgee are kidnapped (or""captured"",whatever word is preferred) by shawnees. over the next seven days the boys: cleverly escaped from the shawnee,faced hunger in the wilderness,shot(!)a renegade,almost drowned,and finally returned home to their' families.this story is a bit different than the regular scholastic book services books. it is probably more for older teens like,12 to 14 year olds,not so much younger children. there is some interesting bits like dave and jem using sign language to communicate with eachother. also,people who lived in the 18th/19th centuries HADto be self-reliant-even the children. that is how they survived hardship. dave and jem demonstrate this in their' daily routine.an interesting read with some nice drawings by kurt werth."
3,Memories of a time when character is formed by reality,"While reading Emma's story, I could not help but believe one's character is often formed by family environment. It's not what you have, but what you don't which may personally drive you to acheive or plan goals. Although her story takes place in a certain time in America, the story itself is timeless. Living off the land is difficult enough with today's ""modern conveniences,"" but to persevere the harsh Dakota climate takes fortitude and tenacity. ""That which does not kill us, makes us stronger."""
4,Pure acid music!,"When I bought this CD I didn't know how it would sound when it said ""instrumental"" but what I found is that basically they just took out the lyrics! Which has it's advantages if you're not comfortable with the extremely graphic lyrics contained in the original version or if you just enjoy the music by itself. It's a nice thing for collectors to get but if you don't fall in the two categories above I'd just get the original version. It's a unique take on a classic album though, worth my money."
4,"The name's Game, Great but Hard Game","This is a good game but I am trapped at the High Treason level where you have to use the cell phone grapple. If anyone has an answer to my troubles, write it in your review. Otherwise, this is a fun game that you may find yourself reciting or imitating Bond. Sadly, he did lose his handsome charm in this game but as long as you can play, no problem. There is just one flaw, though. The Yuzuki Gunmen are loud and irritating as they say ""Yatzo stupidasol"" and ""Shmi"". It really gets on your nerves especially when you don't know what their saying! This game has a great use of gadgets but is comically unrealistic. If you break a window, nobody notices. If you shoot a guy in the you-know-what, they make a funny cry as they put their hands over it! This is a good Bond game with great action and adventure."
2,too many bugs,"I found this game to be a sorry atempt to repeat Goldeneye. It does have some very benefical graphics, guns, and music. But the women and other characters look like mutants when seen up close. Also it requires Directx 8.1b. This is a drag because most people will have to upgrade to use the system. I would reccomend FPS games like Star Trek elite force and Goldeneye. But i am old school. If you want my advice, check to see if your system can handle DX8.1 first. If you don't it will cost you. (i have a p4 and it still messed up my system)"
2,"Nope, no sir I didnt like it.","I just have one thing to say. I ran up to 5 different enemies in the first level, while blowing their friends away, and they did nothing once I ran behind them. I had time to switch from the SMG, to the pistol, point it, decide to put the silencer on, put the silencer on and finally kill them. Any game with AI like this should be banned. I thought rainbow six was bad with the AI that wouldnt react to their friends getting killed right in front of them but that was 5 years ago, EA has no excuse. I give it a second star because it is Bond and is one of the few games to actually use pixel shading. Avoid this game. Just get the demo and you'll get the best this game has to offer."
2,James Bond should stick to consoles.,"Okay, please excuse me but I feel very sick right now. I got this game for a friend's birthday. I figured ""It's another Bond game, it's gotta be good."" Boy was I DEAD wrong. From the moment the gameplay started, I knew this game was not what I had bargained for. The controls were clunky and buttons were placed in bad spots and the weapons had to be cycled through rather than set to hotkey buttons; the graphics were good but not great; and the levels all had some switch you'd have to pull somewhere in the level to open one of the thousands of locked doors. Now I've got to go now because I think I'm going to puke from giving a BAD gift for a high price. Overall, I can't reccomend this version of the game to anyone. James Bond should stick to consoles if the PC ports are going to turn out like this."
3,Buy it on a console,"James Bond NightFire is kind of weird on PC. I suggest buying it on a next gen console (GameCube, Xbox, PS 2)for the best experience. I got it on GameCube and its way better than computer."
2,Not the best,"Ok, This bond game is very bad. i had a very good video card at the time and it was soooooooo slow! i reccomend you get NOLF 2 or Splinter Cell if you want a spy game! totally waste of money. Spend it on NOLF 2 which is only $20.00!!! Some of the gadgets were kewl. but NOLF 2 and SC have very way better kewl ones!"
2,EA games ...,"EA games cant make a FPS. Rare was the best, and the only competitor is Bungie. Goldeneye will always be the best FPS out there. EA games could only make their's worse. don't buy this. if you want a good stealth game, buy Morrowind, if you want a FPS, buy UT2003. don't waste your time with a special ed. version of goldeneye. goldeneye was good because it was original, not loaded with hi-tech ... and impossible guns."
1,Too Many bugs playing the demo,First of all I've only played the demo and when I did there were so many bugs my computer froze to a point where it ruined the master boot record on my computer. Luckily I had XP to fix the problem. I don't know if the bugs have been fixed on the full version so I'm just cautioning everyone about the problem. Thanks for your time.
3,tired,after a while you get bored with the same things over and over again.It's challenging in places.It is very obvious what is going to happen nextlike the girl betrads Mr. Bond. but I was about to beat it when it froze up my computer shut down when I turned the game on and it didn't work right.
1,Play it on PS2. PC version is trash!,"I loved this game on the PS2, so I bought it for the PC. In the PS2 version there are driving missions and unlockable characters and its really a lot of fun. In the PC version there are NO driving missions at all. In fact, the game is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! Its like someone played the PS2 version then re made it for the PC, only they had a very vague idea of how the missions went and forgot to include driving missions. On the PS2, the last mission is actually hard, while on the PC it is the EASIEST THING EVER! If you want this game, get it for PS2 where it is actually fun."
2,This is too bad,"This game could have been a lot of fun if they would have let you play Mutiplayers without having to conect to the internet, First what if you don't have the internet second what if you can't conect right them which is most of the time, Me and my buddy had so much fun with the last one we played against each other all the time it was a blast.. It is just too bad. I hope the next one has that opption."
3,Lots of words...,"...to tell a brief story. Hard to read - just about the time you get a line on a character and the story, the author switches to another aspect or character and you have to plow through that. Read the first chapter and the last and the Epilogue, and you can save yourself a lot of time. It is NOT fun reading! and NOT a page turner! and I really had looked forward to getting ""into"" it!"
3,Straight to PBS Mystery?,"This novel reads like a script, complete with stage instructions and wardrobe selections. The unwieldy side story of the affair with Emma is worthy of a couple of high schoolers and out of character for AD. It doesn't ring true and it's tiresome.A longtime James fan, I wanted so much to like this book, especially given all the positive reviews. It starts well but becomes mired in endless pages of unnecessary background information about everyone who wanders through, even the very minor characters. The story is reminiscent of ""Death in Holy Orders"" in the interaction between between the main victim and the others in a closed environment. There are also several character types whom you'll recognize from other books (I kept thinking back to ""The Skull Beneath the Skin"" and ""The Black Tower)."
2,The Lighthouse,"I was very disappointed with this book, especially after reading all of the very positive reviews. I gained nothing, learned nothing, and did not find it at all interesting. The supposed character insights are boring, and frankly not realistic. The crime did not have much of a puzzle to it. I was not engaged. Just one man's view."
3,A disappointing homage to Agatha Christie,"From the dedication to James' husband who died over 40 years ago, to the classic (and, for James, uncharacteristic) title and cover art, to the sealed venue and tightly worked puzzle of the plot, it is immediately clear that The Lighthouse is meant to evoke the familiar and much loved ""locked box"" mysteries of Agatha Christie. Unfortunately, Dame Agatha would likely have done this one better. If you haven't spotted the red herrings halfway through, you weren't paying attention. If you're wondering how an island can be shut down to possible outsiders, or why it hosts a random bevy of famous authors, scientists, and international types, the explanation is both clunky and slightly risible. And if you yearn for James' earlier sharp characterizations of Dalgliesh and his staff, they remain -- until far too late -- bloodless wraiths who march past the shopworn scenery and creaky plot machinations in this disappointing novel from a superlative mystery writer."
3,"Excellent writing, tired plot.","I am a fan of P.D. James, and have read most if not all of her mysteries. I also read her wonderful autobiography, which I highly recommend. The Lighthouse, unfortunately, takes me to settings (a remote island/manor house/church/you name it) and a plot that no longer compel my interest. Been there, done that. I contrast Ms. James' plot and characters with those of Donna Leon, whose mysteries set in Italy seem fresher and varied, perhaps because the latter may be at an earlier stage in her writing career. As for The Lighthouse, let me merely note that the ""solution"" comes to Dagliesh while he is suffering a high fever (with SARS). Not very credible.Thanks for all the good reads, Ms. James, but I am afraid it's time for me to move on."
4,Sumptuous Language,"I admit that I read PD James just to luxuriate in the way she writes. I'm a bedtime reader, and took my time to read and enjoy the mystery. Even a bad James novel is better than most anything else on the market. I just hope Dagliesh finally gets the girl."
3,typical P.D. James,"This latest P.D. James is typical of her works. It starts out introducing a group of characters which are subsequently well developed. They are cast into a highly evocative setting - this time, as usual, dealing with the sea and the Church of England. She lays down a lot of clues among which the reader can eventually - after the solution is announced - select thaose of importance. Also, as usual, the love life of the detectives gets a lot of attention, for better or worse.All this is great, but ultimately the ending iss a big let down. In this case, the main detective awakes from a febrile cloud with the solution suddenly clear. To this is added a few pages of thrills as the killer takes a last dangerous stand.The greatest suspense in this particular book is if she will kill off her detective through the agency of SARS. An enjoyable read, but much within a formula."
5,Book Lover,"I have read almost all of P.D. James' books and have loved them all. She is the best. The book is well written and the horrific murders in ""The Lighthouse"" keep you reading. I found it riveting, frightening, and ultimately satisfying. If you have not read any of her other books, go out and buy them, you will not be sorry."
4,"A Slow Read, But Well Worth the Time","Readers will either find Jame's continued use of the same plot formula good or bad. I personally love the way she introduces the character in the first third of the book, before any real drive in the mystery takes place. Understandably, some readers may find her pace to slow. By taking the time to properly get readers emotionally invested in the characters, the story becomes a powerful crime novel."
3,"Average, like most of her recent books","No, this is not a masterpiece ala her earlier works like The Black Tower or Death of an Expert Witness. However, it is not a washout either. Plotting never has been a particular strength of hers so it is unfair to criticize the book solely from a plot perspective. Having said that, there are several cringeworthy passages at critical junctures. Without revealing any critical spoilers, it is sufficient to state that Vasoline never should be used as a critical plotting device involving bra and panties. The setting of a remote lighthouse off the coast of England gives the Baroness a fine opportunity to display her gifts for detailing place and time in her classical fashion which is perhaps her best strength. For Dalgleish aficionados, it shows him in a supporting role relegated to the background due to circumstances which are plot sensitive and won't be detailed in this review."
1,A Disappointment,"I am a fan of P.D. James' previous mysteries, but the Lighthouse is a disappointment. The new characters don't engage the reader and the whole idea of a murder in an inaccessible location has been done better by others. The sub-plot of making Dagliesh ill is handled clumsily (could Ms. James have spared us the melodrama and just given him the flu instead of a trendy disease?), the 'reveal' of the murder is a letdown and the arrest of the murderer seemed to be written for a Hollywood production (Vaseline???)Stubenville, Metro Philadelphia, PA"
3,Suspect science,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as others by this author. To me, the ""reveal"" at the end felt as if the author was just wanted to finish the book, and without wanting to give away the plot, I wasn't convinced by the scientific clues to the killer's motives."
1,The Lighthouse,Extremly slow plot. To much detail of characters. Reader needs to practice his diction and try not to mumble as much. loud volume and close consetration required to understand.
3,"Enjoyable, but not PD James at her best","Enjoyable read but PD James is not at her best in this latest installment of the Adam Dalgleish mysteries. She throws out a couple of vital clues, near the beginning of the book and in the middle, which should give the reader the identity of the murderer. The writing style is the same and she has no peer in describing mood, surroundings and feelings. However, she tantalizes you with scenes of Dalgleish's, Kate's and Benton-Smith's personal lives but at the end, you are left wanting more."
4,Masterfully Written,"I would have gone with 5 stars if not for the first 80 or so pages. If you get past the long drawn out introduction of the characters, the story is excellent, as is the writing & setting. A novel that grips you to the very end"
4,Watery Country Manor Mystery,"The LighthouseIf you have read P.D. James before, there is no need to read any further for this is another of her gripping mysteries that will keep you up late into the night reading it. How does a nice lady like her come up with the most vile forms of murder for Adam Dalgliesh and his team to solve?This mystery could be called an ""English Manor-House Mystery"" since all of the characters, innocent, guilty, victims and investigators are all sequestered leaving us to decide who-dun-itIf you have a good map of the southwest of England, look for the island of Combe with its famous lighthouse off of the coast of Cornwall on the edge of the Bristol Channel. You will have a hard time finding it even on the best and latest of the Ordnance Survey charts. Why is that? In the book, P.D. James explains that the island is owned by a private trust. That trust has been sucessful in keeping the existence of this island unknowns to those who are not islanders. This book may change that."
3,Audiobook Shortcoming,"We decided to try listening to, rather than reading, P.D.James on a long car trip.It was a bad decision.James' work is meant to be read, not listened to. Her achingly rich physical descriptions become really tedious and wandering when read, even by a skilled and empathetic reader like Charles Keating.This is a great story, representing a very notable development of an ongoing James character. We learned that, to be appreciated, it must be read.Live and learn!"
5,James use of language is unsurpassed. The plot lines are engaging as well as complex.,"James use of language is unsurpassed; the plot lines are engaging as well as complex, completely believable. I highly recommend her work."
5,The Lighthouse by P D James,I read many of P D James books and I enjoyed this one also. Not one of my favorites but still do enjoy reading Adam Dalgliesh books
4,And Then there were none in the Lighthouse,"These P.D. James Adam Dalgliesh books are great reads. As always the sprightly James focuses on a place, with 95% of the action and all of the murders occuring on a remote fictional island. An eccentric British clan has set up a trust to ensure that the overworked politicans, scientists, and businessmen have a place to relax in solitude, but unfortunately some of them leave the island feet first.Ms. James drops clues along the way, as always you need to focus on details about the place, not the people or events, in order to solve this mystery. I could not solve it but it was all there when explained. AD brings along a pair of young hopeful detectives to carry his bags and drink fine wine into the late evenings. Unfortunately infectious diseases show up, and the juniors need to take charge. AD and his muse seem to be moving closer to something permanent but we leave that for another book."
2,A Great Disappointment,"After the brilliance of Death In Holy Orders (to my mind Baroness James' finest book) there have been a pair of disappointments: The Murder Room and now The Lighthouse. Both novels suffer from lackluster plotting and an absolute absence of anything even remotely resembling humor.I wrote elsewhere that Baroness James is so busy elevating the murder mystery into literature with a capital L that she can often over-reach: the occasional literary allusion to Anthony Trollope can be fun, but eventually the poetic allusions start to feel shoe-horned in to the dialogue.To be fair, the book begins well. Baroness James is very skilled at creating closed environments and establishing relationships among a diverse set of characters. But before too long I detected the beginnings of a Big Finish, the kind of thing that Baroness James tries for on occasion, and the book just turned very tired and mechanical as the plot ground to a close."
3,Only Because It's PD James,"I'm a PD James fan, so I couldn't help enjoying this book, but it sure wasn't one of her best. I agree with previous reviewers that the ending was a bit of a cop-out and the solution hardly the result of brilliant detective work.Also, I could not understand how on earth Kate Miskin got herself through a window by means of slathering her body with Vaseline (quite a large jar, I imagine). In the process she dislocates her shoulder, but continues to soldier on through an ugly confrontation. I've never had a dislocated shoulder, but anyone I've ever seen with a dislocated anything is screaming his head off!"
3,Out of Thin Air,"P.D continues to be one of my favorite authors. However, in this book, I feel ""had"" by the way in which the author reveals who the murderer is. Basically James just tells you who it is and what happened in that person's past life to serve as a motive. The crime team has little or nothing to do with the discovery of these facts."
5,Muy Bueno,"I am a high school student who uses this book, and I believe this is a great book. Students learn simple phrases and expressions, and later on they learn to conjugate verbs and Spanish grammar. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to learn Spanish."
3,DIFFERENT BOTTLES,"I did not received what was shown in the picture. It was in a different bottle, but simliar, and came a little later than what the email stated"
1,Couldn't even finish...,"Ususally i love Nora Roberts, but I couldn't even finish these stories. Especially "" Her Mother's Keeper"", because in the beginning, Gwen doesn't like the idea of her mother dating a man twelve years younger than her, but she herself is 12 years younger than Luke. She's very hypocrytical."
1,Boring!,Both of these short stories are basically the exact same down to some of the dialogue used in each. Don't waste your time.
1,horrible,"I have read every Nora Roberts book that I can get my hands on. I've loved most of them, but both of these were just aweful. I never connected with the characters, there wasn't any captivating story line, and it was just plain boring. None of her older books are as good as the new ones, but most of them are still readable, and some what enjoyable. This one isn't even worth checking out from the library for free."
2,Fluff,"Nora sure knows how to describe the men. I can understand how the ""cowboy"" got and kept his alluring shape, but how did the novelist in the 2nd story do it? Occasionally chopping down a tree? I found it difficult to remember Gwen's mom was stated as being 47. Her mannerisms and expressions and behavior spoke of someone at least 20 years or more older. Do 47 year old women go around calling 35 year old male boarders darling? And everyone was dear with a pat on the hand. I have a 47 year old daughter and she certainly doesn't act like that, nor do I. Yes what was the reason to republish these 2 old novels in a new book?"
4,Hella Rallye 4000 Fog,"I have owned a lot of Hella 4000 lights. Never had a single problem with any of them. The best light on the market, bar none! I wouldn't put anything else on my truck, buggy, or baja bug. I purchased the fog light for the first time and was not content with the light pattern for what I needed it for. The light beam lights up everything around the front of the truck, but I was looking for a longer beam with some width. I'm sure it would be perfect for fog on the street. I was looking for more of a flood light for offroad. For this I bought another set of euro-beams."
1,this game is cruel,"this game is the most gruesume, cruel game i have ever played. all u do is drive a car around looking for some type animal to hit and kill, so i suggest not to bye it.(i sent it back it was so bad)"
2,not what they used to be.,"I grew up with these, and they seemed pretty indestructible. I have bought three sets in the past few years, and i have to say they are not so sturdy. Several have broken by just dropping to the floor. Not woth the price."
3,okay but not the best quality,"The speakers are ready to use out of the box; but the quality is just acceptable. They are quite good for their size, and obviously don't take up much space on the computer desk."
2,I've heard better,"I hooked these up, and put them back in the box.I sent them right back to Amazon. A+++++ for Amazon! Great service, as for the speakers a big D-MINUS !!!!!"
4,Great story - remembered it from my childhood,I remembered this book from my childhood and bought it for our little one. Great story and interesting artwork.
1,Gory nonsense,A typical episode: the emperor orders one of the brothers beheaded for no good reason. But this brother has bones of steel which breaks the executioner's sword.Do you want to put such gory nonsense into your children's heads when their minds are getting acquainted with the world?
4,I Still Like 5 Chinese Brothers Better,"I, like many other reviewers, grew up on The Five Chinese Brothers. I always loved that book - not for its pictures but for its message. It is about family and I was kind of surprised that there were no parent in the new version. After reading Seven Chinese Brothers, I still like the original the best. I agree with another reviewer that we try to shield our children from everything instead of discussing things with them. Stories are not just meant to be read but discussed. It is true that the pictures in the current version are more colorful and more appealing to the flash and dazzle to which many of our children have become so accustomed. But try having the children focus on the message and not the beauty or lack thereof of the messenger."
3,Avoids the stereotypes of the earlier version,"I won't spend my time discussing the storyline, since most readers will be familiar with it.This book is better than the earlier version of ""Seven Chinese Brothers"" I grew up with, yet it lack that book's superior pacing and melodic flow.But still, this book is the better one in that it is conscious of the stereotypes permeating throughout the earlier version and thus eliminates them.The ending could have been stronger since it seems to end hanging in mid-air.The illustrations are superior to the previous version with an Asian-influenced use of watercolor.The main problem is that, overall, the book doesn't disappoint, yet nor does it impress. A solid, somewhat lackluster book."
3,Good boy version of a classic tale,"Another version of basically the same tale, The Seven Chinese Brothers tells the story of seven brothers each with a different special power (amazing hearing, amazing vision, strength, iron bones, legs that could grow, never getting hot, and crying tears to drown a village...not exactly a great super power there). Feeling threatened by the strength of one man, the Emperor decides to execute the third brother. Together, the brothers outwit the Emperor and are all saved as the two armies are swept away along with the Emperor at the hands (...or tears) of the baby brother. An amusing little tale about working together as a team but probably too much for a sensitive listener--threats of decapitation, drowning, being burned alive, and shot full of arrows....hmmm....not so good for bedtime reading.If you want to read my reviews of 35 books having to do with China for kids, go to my 7/2/2012 post on myoverthinking(dot)com"
2,Meh,"I bought this because it's one my fiance remembered from his childhood and wanted to share with our babies. Not the greatest story, hard to read in an interactive way with the kids, and the drawings are nothing special."
5,hip hop,As a mother of teen-age kids it's refreshing to find some good clean hip hop music. A perfect gift for teen-agers and music even the parents will enjoy!
4,Great stand alone fantasy story,My 9-year-old daughter and I both really enjoy this story; I wish that there were more stories available by this author. It doesn't follow your typical Luke Skywalker / Harry Potter / Eragon coming of age scenario.
5,Muy Caliente !!!!,I truly enjoyed this book I felt like I could relate to the characters in the story because I am also puerto rican and black. When I first bought this book I thought it was a little slim with the pages but the content in those small pages were HOT HOT HOT. I related to the baby shower the food that was cooked just everything about this read was good. This author did a great job for her first time out. I am looking forward to reading Los Morenos.
4,Very handy booklet with wise words that you can bring anywhere you go.,"The booklet is small enough to carry it anywhere you go, so you can review the wise words of Ueshiba Sensei wherever and whenever you like.The booklet contains a comprehensive collection of his wise words and messages.It is recommended to those who are acquainted with his philosophy."
1,"this is very misleading, very dissapointed,","this book isnt about AIKIDO, THE ART OF PEACE, every page is but simple kindergarden quotes that fill up half a page if that---has nothing to do with the training mindset,ideas,philosophies,mediations,stories,examples,just quotes.some dont even make any sense! if you are truley searching for the art of peace, i would suggest look elsewhere.if this came with arms, i'd get it in an armbar and flip it then do some jeet kun do on the cover, maybe hit it with my kitana,give it a good muay thai kick!"
5,"Wonderful truth from the ""Great Teacher""!","I love this little book and I love O Sensei - ""The Great Teacher"" as he is known. As a practicing aikidoka I can vouch that all of the things he says are true and very useful both when learning aikido and in everyday life. Its a small book which can be read very quickly but the truths can be absorbed over a life time. It deserves reading over and over.Makes a great gift! God bless O Sensei."
5,A great book for all Aikidoka,This book is filled with many things upon which to reflect. I would not recomend it to people not familiar with Aikido because much of the book is about the art. If you are an Aikidoka read this book it will help you a great deal with the nonphysical aspects of the martial art.
1,Tiny,My review is not based on content it is a review of this version of the book itself. This book is the size of a deck of cards but half as thick. Huge disappointment. I guess instead of keeping it on my bookshelf I'll keep it in my gym bag. Buy a different version.
5,More than a book,"Ive had many versions of this book over a 18 year period. This version is the one I go to again and again. The sayings and words don't always mean something to you when you read them, but over time the wisdom reveals itself to you when it is needed. A must for anyone who enjoys wisdom."
5,A must buy with book!!!,This is soooo cute. I bought it along with book. A gift set to my little boy to remind him of how much I love him :)
3,Is this the right price $99?,"$99. are you kidding! I paid about around $7. for this item 4 yrs. ago. My dog just ate the ""baby"" rabbit. I sure hope this isn't a ""collectors"" item or I'm going have to retrieve the baby out of the dog's stomach! I wasn't impressed with this rabbit when I got it."
4,Rockabilly Roots Revved up & Rarin' to Go,"Setzer's love for the roots of rockabilly is abundantly evident here. My only question is why he didn't record these tracks at the studio that inspired them. Nonetheless, his energy is at a high-point in this love letter to Sun. This hot batch o' tracks makes his swing band schtick sound like Lawrence Welk.Sure, the source materials are historically richer, and have a lot more depth than this package could possibly encompass, but when taken as the tribute that it is, Setzer doesn't get much better than this.Hey, Elvis & Jerry Lee did covers too, lest you forget. In fact, most of the music industry pre-1965 thrived on covers, then known as ""standards"". It's only in the current era of sampling that some seem to think these covers have no place. Go figure. I think they show off these tunes from the perspective of a true rockabilly artist.If you love 50's rockabilly, this is a must-have."
4,Stayed True (+) & (-),"This is a really great album. ""The Great One"" put out another great rockabilly album. I would DEFINITELY advise the swingin' cats, dancers, rockabilly purists and those that love this music to buy this album! The sound, reverb, echo, tempo and all that jazz is true to the originals. Even the guitar & piano solos are true to the originals (plus a FEW of signature licks). For those looking for smoking versions of the Sun hits (sorry) this is not for you. Brian stayed true...if that's what you wanted...buy some Stray Cats albums!"
3,Vanilla Rock-A-Billy From One Of The Greats,"The problem is I have heard this songs to death, Brian is not really putting anything new into them. i prefer his original written songs better. I guess for those who are new to the Rock-A-Billy scene this might be a good record, but I just think Brian is getting old and has lost some of his fire. I hope he proves me wrong, with a future effort."
4,Honest and emotional - Beck's best,"It's easy to knock Beck, but you gotta respect a guy who has released so many different sounding albums.There's his most popular effort Odelay which fused all sorts of music from hiphop, jazz and country into a coherent whole. Even though I'll openly admit that I'm not a fan of that album, it's still considered by many to be one of the greatest albums of the 90's.Mutations was an incredibly diverse album which worked really well for me. Midnite vultures (from what I have heard of it) is his Prince album.This, on the other hand, is his Nick Drake album. Like Blood on the tracks before it, this is Beck's breakup album. It's an incredibly lush piece of work that gets better with every listen. Many classic albums from the history of rock have been borne out of tragedy - Neil Young's classic Tonight's the night being a prime example of this.An honest and emotional record, this is Beck's finest work to date."
5,Masterful,"The best cd's cannot be judged by an initial listen. Great music grows on you. On the first listen of Sea Change I thought, 'Hmmmm... folky, very mellow...and interesting.' On the tenth listen, I loved it and on the thirtieth, I was in awe. When I first bought Mutations I had a similar impression except I sat that cd down, listened to it six months later and kicked myself for not giving it a chance.If you are expecting songs like 'Loser,' 'Devil's Haircut' or 'Sexx Laws,' you'll find nothing like that on Sea Change. What you will find is this unpredictable artist surprising you will thoughtful lyrics, beautiful melodies and as always, interesting instrumentations (with help from Nigel Godrich). 'The Golden Age' is a great introduction but for me, the disc really shines on tracks 4-11.This may eventually replace Mutations as my favorite Beck disc. If you are a true Beck fan, you cannot do without this disc. It is that good."
5,"Buy it,,,Don't be cheap and download it!!","Word of warning: This is Beck's Most mature and best work to date. Therefore, don't download these songs!... If you do, well you're missing something very special. There is a continuity to this album that is amazing..Each song seems to flow into the next. We also know that mp3s don't have the same sound quality that one can get from a cd. This disc has subtle textural shifts that requires repeated listens. At first I was surprised. This is not the Beck with the hip hop beats, and foolish lyrics..Instead he has given us something from his heart..When I heard Lost Cause I broke down and cried.....Not since Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot have I found something that I just can't quit listening to."
2,Will someone please give him some Prozac?,God I really liked all of Becks other albums but this was awful.And boring.Depressing too. The last 2 songs are actually real good but most of it is just crap.Hes gotta do better than this.Next album please.
1,bad beck,this record is bad. mutations is great. how dare you rip off sarge? and call it a spoon song? well...I never...see you at fred 62 ;)
2,"It's Good, but Overhyped...","I was expecting something brilliant because of all the hype surrounded by this one album. Beck is a good band, I wouldn't say that they're immensely talented, but they have some great songs. Frankly, I found this album boring. That's not to say that the lyrics and the music aren't beautiful, but at times all the songs come off as sounding exactly the same. The fact that they all have the same theme-sadness- doesn't really help either. As somebody has said, there are more ways to express sadness than one. Beck just keeps using the same lazy, depressed, bummed out sound throughout each song. It almost puts me to sleep with each listen. I think Beck has better songs and albums out there."
1,Worst yet,"I can't play this CD by itself. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Beck fan. But, this one is completely depressing."
1,Dull and monotonous,God.. this is soooo dull.. you can hardly tell the difference between any of the songs..what happened to the creative and innovative genius of old.
2,Mellow Gold/Odelay this is not...,"If you are expecting Mellow Gold or Odelay, then stay far, far away from this. It's an entire album of somewhat wannabe Rolling Stones ballads.Is it sad? Yes. Is it dark? Yes. It it entertaining? Not really. It just comes across as an entire album of boring guitar ballads. It isnt bad, just boring. *yawn*.My friend let me borrow this, and I seriously wouldn't even burn it (and I am a Beck fan). Buyers beware..."
2,uninspired,"I expected a lot more this time around. This CD can only be described as 'lazy', lacking the studio bells and whistles of Odelay, for example. How many songs can you listen to in which Beck sounds like Perry Como before you either fall asleep or want to turn this off and return to the living world??! .. not many. The one positive: He did not use his disco falsetto voice on this CD. Thank god."
1,"In ""Sea Change"" Beck is floundering","This is Beck's lowest point as a lyric writer and musician.It's clear that the music and tone is about a failed relationship. Beck should have been able to mine this period of his life for some depth like many musicians before him but he can only cough up cliches like ""you're dead to me now"".Beck as a confessional singer/songwriter doesn't cut it. Compare this music to someone like Suzanne Vega's ""Songs in Red and Gray"" from last year which created great poetry out of her failed marriage. Compare this music to early Neil Young, whose song's like ""Heart of Gold"" or ""Don't let it Bring you Down"" cover the same region of the heart.Perhaps in time he may be able to pull some depth out of his private pain, but in this cd he tries for the spirt of Dylan and ends up sounding like Gordon Lightfoot."
2,Change Is Not Always A Good Thing,"I'd rather be listening to Mutations...still in all, I'm looking forward to seeing Beck live with The Flaming Lips. I found this album, to be blunt, boring. If it's low-key music and strange lyrics you're looking for, you'll certainly get your fix with the last Sparklehorse album or something.I only got this CD because it was Beck, and though I think musicians doing something different is great, I expected something...more...of Beck.That's just my opinion.I didn't like 'Kid A' or 'Hot Shots II' either.Maybe I'm just bummed...maybe I should just listen again."
2,i simply cannot recommend this album,"for the last decade Beck has been the iconic master of eclecticism. each of his albums brought a new mix of every possible musical influence under the sun. and they were all, in their way, fun. this music is post-modern funeral dirge music sung without any joy, let alone any sense of melody or hooks. usually i'm not one to chastise an artist for doing something different, for taking a chance. but to go from such a great, visionary producer to making this joyless, spare, and utterly ...tastic record was in my opinion a career misstep. i hope he gets back on track with his next album."
2,Yeah It's Pretty.......PRETTY BOARING!!,"For starters get Marianne Faithfull's new album ""Kissin Time"". Beck produced & co-wrote some of the tracks. Everything from the album cover on up is very similar to Sea Change and I really do believe THAT was the kind of album he was trying to make.There are only three tracks here that really stand out...those would be ""The Golden Age"" ""Lost Cause"" and ""Sunday Sun"". I work at a record store so i've had the opportunity to scan through all the music magazines...where all these good reviews are coming from I don't really know. The cd..the SONGS are pretty but that doesn't always mean they're good. I've listened too all of Beck's previous studio albums...and this is the worst!"
5,Wonderful,"Beck is a full-blown genius. His music is touching, sad, sweet, funky, emotional...the list goes on and on. Beck is one of my favorite musicians ever. This CD is very different from Odelay, being more sad and mellow. But this CD is amazing, If you have only heard Odelay and want to see if Beck can be more than witty lyrics and funky sounds, than this album is for you."
4,This album grows on you.,Thats all I can say.At first listen you probably wont like it but when youre sad and lonely and want to cry or just want to know someone is as bummed as you are this is the album to listen to you even though the last 2 songs actually sound pretty cheery.
5,a masterpiece,"I generally find music reviews useless and misguiding, but this one sets a new standard:""Whatever's going on in Beck's world, at least we know he's purging, which, all things considered, may be better for his soul than ours. --Kim Hughes "" (editorial review)Are they paying this guy to write this junk? ""Sea Change"" is nothing short of a masterpiece."
4,one of his best,"I have almost all Beck's works and this is the best together with ""mutations"". I prefer Beck when he does not exaggerate with his usual ""kind-mix mood"". Sometimes this feature leads to ingenious and pleasant songs, specially in albums like Mellow Gold or Odelay. But the risk to make mess songs is not do far...Sea Change is completely different: unplugged and orchestrated, he could sound monochord at first, but it grows constantly with listenings for the strenght of each song!"
3,What Happend to Beck?,"I was had much anticipation for this album it got really good reviews and i loved becks previous work. I bought this album expecting a great Beck album I was dooped this album is slow and depressing. Sea Change isnt bad yet it isnt good either It left me with a feeling of nothing which was probably Becks intent. Songs like ""paper tiger"" sound like the beatles ""I am the walrus""... Songs like ""I guess im doin fine""..."
3,mr. happy,"take 6 songs of slide somberness, 6 songs of soaring orchestral somberness then seat them boy-girl-boy-girl... the formula wears thin. pull the best 2 (o.k., 3) and save them for the next Beck album. save you cash too and just pick-up the cd single for ""paper tiger."""
1,This CD is just plain boring,"I bought this CD without the benefit of hearing it first on a listening station. The last CD I purchased by Beck was Odelay. I had read two great reviews of Sea Change in usually reputable magazines, and, since I liked Odelay, assumed I would also like this. Either my taste in music has changed or this CD is just downright boring. I've listened to it three times now and can't see where all those great reviews are coming from. Are musicians so lacking in innovation these days that Rolling Stone would rave about something this lightweight?"
1,"skip, skip, skip, decent track, skip..","I have to allign with the 1 stars here. This is NOT a good album. RS gave this a 5 star and I honestly think they have a stake in the record sales. This is slow, lifeless and lacking any punch. Whats with the symphony junk on this album? This never works. But beyond that, there arent any interesting songs. Ok, I'll say there are 3 decent tracks but on a stronger album, they'd be filler at best. Maybe Beck feels dull and lifeless these days and if thats the case, he's succeeded in putting it in song. It doesnt make for an interesting listen though."
2,"What happened to you, Beck?","Wow. Has Beck ever changed. This ""Yer Cheatin' heart"" style music is hard to listen to.It's so depressing. It's like someone ripped the creative spark from Beck's brain. Sure there's still musical genius there, but the point of listening to music is enjoying it or connecting with it. Oh well, Beck always does his own thing. I can't bear to give him one star when all of his other CDs are fivers."
1,Did somebody punch Beck in the mouth?,"That is the only explanation I can come up with as to why Beck sounds like he's mumbling his way through this entire album.A lot of the time I'll mention songs that stand out and then go through a breakdown of which songs are bad and which ones are okay. There's no reason to do that since all of the songs, with the exception of Paper Tiger, are awful on this album.Seriously: Get ahold of Paper Tiger (which is frankly an amazing song) on iTunes and forget the rest of this album."
5,A masterpiece of our time,"What a whirlwind of emotions Beck has displayed. This album has touched me and has allowed me to relate completly with what Beck is conveying. It is the most perfect CD for bedtime, anytime, it is chill. Beck is so talented that he is able to change his style but still be able to keep a sense of himself in each of his CD's. While I am one who is not able to say a bad thing about any of his work, Sea change has proven to be one of my favorite discs. I highly recommend this to everyone, you will not be disapointed with what Beck has given to us."
4,It's Beck Tacular,"Beck moves from his usual formula of semantic play on this album for a more recognisable lyrical format. I think it is basically an album for Beck fans but the uninitiated can still appreciate it, but I don't think they'd really get it. He is a musician certainly above his field, which is probably why you won't see him in many top 50 countdowns. Anyway, back to the album. It just sort of strolls and meanders along much in the same vain as Mutations with some busy picking and sensational orgestral moments that build and dissipate at will. His Elmer Fuddessque drawl works once again and with such a tongue-in-cheek classic as Lost Cause it's a sure winner. Other highlights include Guess I'm Doing Fine and Lonesome Tears."
5,"Only ""hard-core"" fans...","If you liked Beck's Mutations, which I immensely enjoyed, then you'll most likely enjoy this album as well. Some may call the music ""depressing""...and these will probably be the same people who expected another Odelay when Mutations was released.Musicians such as Beck evolve, and their fans (hopefully?) grow with them. His latest album certainly isn't another Midnight Vultures or Odelay. It's not even another Mutations, but it may be the closest Beck album to it! Yet this shouldn't deter anyone from enjoying the music on this latest album. Simply be realistic--don't expect sugar-sweet-sappy music when listening to this album for the first time.Some may find the music depressing, others will find it more thought-provoking and...well, refreshingly ""real.""same way Mutations was"
4,Beautiful Album,"This is definately one of my favorite albums.A 180 in a style change from Beck's norm, and I loved it. Every song envokes so much emotion, it's almost overwhelming. There really isn't much I can say. Favorite track on the album is ""Paper Tiger"". Check it out, really, you should."
2,"""Sea Sick"" might be more decriptive.","This CD illustrates what's really ailing the music industry: it's not free downloading, it's lousy product by the so-called major artists. The 2 stars are only here for the engineering and the marketing, not the songs or performance (which merits 1 star at best).Beck delivers another CD of trite musical poses and stylings that sinks because there is nothing of substance to support it. Songs that go no place, and will never be cool anywhere. Play this at a hip, happening party, and one of 2 things will happen: people will leave, or someone will say ""what happened to the GOOD music?"" Radio stations will probably lose ratings if they put this in heavy rotation.If the record company over-pressed in anticipation of mega sales, then this stiff is headed for the cutout bins next year. So, wait until this is a [price] bargain CD. Better yet, pass and just let it sink because it's not any good."
1,What A Bummer!,"This cd is one big BORE. All of the songs are depressing. None of them are good. Buy at your own risk. Even if you are a fan of Beck's previous efforts, you should avoid this one at all costs."
2,The softer side of Beck...,"First off, I love just about everything Beck has done to date, even some of the more folky, country sounding stuff. This release goes even further down that trail. It definitly has a certain melancholy mood that flows thoughout the cd. What's got you so down Beck?To be fair, I have only listened to it once so maybe it isn't fair to rate this yet; but I really haven't heard anything on this album that stands out.Unless you really love the slower and more mellow aspects of Mutations, you will probably be disappointed. This is not the funky, sampled, radio friendly Beck here."
1,Beck dives into the depths of horror,"This album is grossly overproduced and I wish I never bought it. What happenned to Beck? He was the genius behind Stereopathetic Soul Manure, One Foot In The Grave, Mellow Gold and Odelay and then it seems that the corporate 9-to-5ers got to him. Every album since Odelay has been grossly overproduced and you will find the names of the producers in big letters on the back of each of his last three albums.Also, it seems that the critics are afraid to criticize him.Someone must be paying off these critics. To all of the critics: have some guts!I now gladly use this cd as a coaster on my coffee table. ..."
2,Wake me when it's over,"""Sea Change"" lacks any kind of energy, and its lyrics would yield only yawns from Mrs. Bumthrust's grade 10 creative writing class. At this point in his career, Beck's music is comparable to old folkies like James Taylor, though his humourless earnestness makes even Taylor seem more fun than a barrel full o' Buzzcocks."
1,Major Letdown,"Beck's family must have been hit by a bus, and his woman left him, and his dog died, all in the same week... because this is some seriously depressing material. No spunk, no life, and very little creativity. Of course with Beck, you are going to hear some unique twinges of brilliance, even on a mood album like this... but I'm telling you... this is not Beck as you know him, not at all. This is Beck on heroin in a pool of depression. Until now, I have loved ALL of his material, this makes me want to cry for a bit, and then go to sleep. I fail to see the genius in this one. Hopefully he has a ""real"" release in the works that will be soon to follow this misery."
3,WAIT FOR THE NEXT LP W/ DAN THE AUTOMATOR,"If you liked MUTATIONS you'll love SEA CHANGE. If you loved MIDNITE VULTURES and STEREOPATHETIC SOUL MANURE then SEA CHANGE is one to avoid. Beck's best low-key effort is ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE. That record is genius. If you have that one already you probably have LEONARD COHEN's firt record, or maybe his BEST OF? SEA CHANGE sounds forced and dishonest. A great down-tepo record this year is CORNELIUS' POINT. At one time refered to as Japan's answer to BECK with his cut-and-paste style on FANTASMA, POINT is the most beautiful album out this year. Oh, anyone know why the covers on the SEA CHANGE CD change? That is the coolest part about it!"
3,One shade of gray,"I completely don't understand the obsession with this album. Yes, Beck is talented, and the music is good. The lyrics are beautiful, the production well-done. However, each song sounds the same... where's that Beck originality and color? Sounds almost as if he harnessed and rehashed all the slow Pink Floyd songs ever released, which are beautiful in their own right, but simply not what I was hoping for in this album.Someone needs to tell Beck that ""sad"" can be expressed in more ways than one...."
2,What are these people talking about?!,"...By reading their own comments you would expect lower ratings. I was extremely disappointed with this album. Yeah, it's got some beautiful moments, but it is essentially the same song over and over. It certainly is sad and evokes s self-centered mood, but do we really need anyone to take us there in this day and age? ""Lonesome Tears"" is the most interesting, but it too falls short of creativity. I love Beck, and I hate to say it, but this album BORED ME TO DEATH. It truly appears to me that not alot of work went into this project. I can say that if you like monotony and predictable musical arrangements, this is the album for you...Go ahead all Beck-is-God followers, rate me bad, but it's not going to change the fact that this album truly is not good."
2,<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Good but not great>>>>>>>>>>>>>&,"Overall, this is an O.K. effort by Mr. Hansen. It comes off (after one listening) to be a bit overproduced. Goodrich is a fan of (heavy) compression and in these beautifully written songs, it wreaks utter havoc (for other examples of this see 'Pavement's Terror Twilight'). This could have been a powerful masterpiece that would stand the test of time. But unfortunately we are cursed with all the miscellaneous ""studio bells and whistles"". Beck is and will always be a low-fi artist. Please accept this."
2,bland,"As a big fan of Beck and beautiful bummer music, I was really let down by this release. I don't find one song of great beauty on here, or anything with which I connect on an emotional level. His singing here is flat and static. The lyrics are hard to hear. The arrangements are odd, sterile, and echoey, and the songs all crawl off to nowhere. Anyone looking to get into music of this nature would do better to buy Nick Drake, Pernice Brothers, Iron and Wine, Ron Sexsmith, Fairport Convention, Love, Bread, Elliott Smith, Josh Rouse, and Tim Buckley, to name just ten. All these artists take sad songs and subjects and elevate things with climbs and arrangement drama. Here, Beck borrows their bells and whistles, adds them at all the wrong times, and mumbles into a microphone inside Nigel Godrich's thousand-acre studio. Result's a snoozer."
2,Not timeless,"It's a mood piece, people. Slow, heartbroken, and consistently so. Depending on what you're into, this could be a blessing or a no-no. Personally, I once thought this album was near-flawless. Beck manages to co-create 12 songs of pure melancholia without ever being melodramatic. But its consistency as a down-troddden record becomes a major flaw after several listens (i.e. repetitious). When your mood changes from sadness to cheerfulness... do you still indulge in the gloom, or move on to sunnier pop songs?"
5,Anything less than 3 stars is laughable,"I like how people that review this album with less than 3 stars think they are real fans of Beck, how dare you? This album is a work of art. What makes an artist truly great is their ability to change and grow. Go buy this album, you will not be disappointed! If you really get Beck, you will get this CD. The majority speaks volumes. I would have loved a few more peppy tunes in the mix, but the tone of the album would have been altered. I predict a little more up beat follow up to this in the future. Then someone can bash that too. You can't please everyone! After listening to this CD, I doubt Beck cares what anyone thinks."
3,took a few listens,"I slapped in this cd eagerly anticipating a fun, absurd wild ride along the lines of Odelay and Midnight Vultures. After the first track I knew that I should have never expected anything predictable from Beck. Due to my excited mood at the time, I was unmoved by this record on the first listen. But I left it the player and the next morning I listened again. This time my mood was right for this sultry and thoughtful side of Beck. There are still rich sonic layers imbedded in this otherwise trimmed down mix of melancholy songs, and Beck once again shines as a true musical talent of our time. The cd has stayed in the player for several days now, and I am chill and yes, a bit pensive."
3,too much of the same thing,"If you take any one song off this CD, it's good. But there is hardly any variety here. It's all slow, downer stuff. If he had mixed it up a little, the CD would have been more listenable."
3,Beckon call,"Beck is like a mellower, modernised neo-Pink Floyd in one. He creates soundscapes, his music more about texture and mood than impact. In fact it was Pink Floyd that led to my liking of Beck.Sea change is my least favourite of his albums, mainly because it's a bit too slow. Depressing isn't always bad, but on Sea Change Beck is so bummed out you can't understand what he's singing. It's just mumbles and synthetic symphony orchestras, underlined with a drum machine. There are a few high points; Already Dead is definitely worth the price of the album alone, but I wouldn't say this is his best. Worth getting, but the sort of thing you'd play on a rainy day or after a break-up."
5,Heartbreaking and brilliant.,"I love this record. Don't buy this disc if you want to be spiritually uplifted though; this record is heartbreakingly sad. From stem to stern this disc sends the message that Mr. Hansen is bummed, but it's so well done. Wonderful arrangements, and none of Beck's patented arty screech noise to break the spell."
5,Beautiful music,"It is true that this CD is both dreary and slightly depressing. contrary what most of the reviews have stated, however, there are tinges of hope and epiphany in most of the songs. after listening to songs like paper tiger, sunday sun, and round the bed- you feel a sense of contentment. its a bizarre feeling, but all the songs are very satisfying and reassuring. i give my highest recommendation to anyone who appreciates well crafted and heartfelt music. this is despite the fact that i dont consider myself a huge Beck fan. so just get it."
5,"Sounds like Gordon Lightfoot, eh?","Excellent album, if only because Beck is paying tribute to one of our alltime best: Gordon Lightfoot!!"
4,uniquely Beck........surprisingly lush,"I've always been a fan of Beck. Including the time I walked out of the Rosemont Horizon during one of his sets touring behind 'Midnight Vultures' because his singing and the music were rubbing nauseous. But I still think he is completely original, sincere and focused on what it takes to make good music: the music.This time around, Beck and Nigel Goderich have put together a gorgeuos classic. I went to bed at 9pm last night but ended up listening to the album around the horn 3x. I left it running and would wake up in the middle of the night to hear this comforting voice comforting himself.If its not what you expected from Beck, then pretend its somebody you've never heard of and keep an open mind. I'm totally psyched about this record."
5,A must have,"A friend of mine turned me on to this cd and I was not dissapointed. Though this may be the saddest album ever recorded, it still appeal to me musically. This cd shows clearly what I feel is the first and last reason to create any form of music, it tells a story. Beck did not write these songs just to sell cd's and make music, he sings from the heart and that is where all great works of art, and i consider this a work of art, come from. Works like this are the reason I myself began to play and write. It may not be appealing to most, but to Beck, under the circumstances it was written, it was a soul clensing. I recommend this CD to fans of Beck (as I am a casual listener to his music) and to fans of music itself. The songs speak for themself."
4,Beck doesn't let you down,"Beck doesn't let you down. I'll never get tired of his eclectic sound. This album is a bit mellow all the way through, but in no way am I disappointed!"
5,Mental pain put to good use.,"This album only shows how this guy can be inspired by anything. Written while seperated form his longtime girlfriend (they got back together and married later by the way), Beck was able to put the situation to very good use. The songs scream out for attention and flow together in a way that anyone can appreciate. If you are used to Loser, Where It's At and E-Pro, you may be surprised that Beck is not always the ""happy go lucky"" kinda guy you imagined. This album shows that he does have his dark momments which happens to be one of the great momments in Beck's history."
5,one of the best of all time,"this is one of the most beautiful albums of all time.it came out while i was studying composition at a music conservatory.we analyzed it in theory.buy this and savor the lyrics, form, and melody."
4,Fantastic sad/mellow acoustic album,"Cracks me up when a reviewer says this:""Play this at a hip, happening party, and one of 2 things will happen: people will leave, or someone will say 'what happened to the GOOD music?'"".Give me a break - what's wrong with different types of music for DIFFERENT situations. You're not going to put this on at a party so why even put that absurdity in a review. Fact is, this is some great music. Some parts remind me of acoustic Neil Young (like ""Already Dead"") and I've even heard a little Waters/Floyd vocal in there. Yes, it's not completely new/original acoustic work, but it's great and it sounds like Beck needed to get it out. Listen a couple of times and it hooks you. Beck is one of those great artists that can change from album to album. Enjoy it - I do."
1,hated it,"Sea Change has all the pacing and dynamics of an iceberg or tectonic plate. Beck mumbles through these songs like he has a mouth full of oatmeal. We went to see the concert and the FLaming Lips saved the whole thing. Long live the Flaming Lips!(beck didn't come out for a whole hour after the Lips's set, too)"
1,Execrable,"The pits. Sold it after two listens. The impeccably recorded sound of someone attempting suicide in a tub of warm slush. Not even impressive as bummer albums go. This is so far off from why anyone began listening to him...I mean, he was fun, right? We didn't expect him to actually say anything, did we? Oh? You did? This is the result. I'm truly amazed at how many people got off on this. I dunno, maybe you bought into it being a breakup record. At least he was honest titling it ""Sea Change"". Indeed.Oh, the Amazon editor is out of his gourd even comparing this to ""Mutations"", which is an excellent record. Go ahead, keep hitting that ""unhelpful"" button. That won't take away from the fact that you gleefully paid money to hear someone mope aboout their misery in a startlingly uninteresting way."
5,A Must Have For Your Music Collection.,"This Cd is one of the best i have heard in a long time. I compare it to coldplay's ""Parachutes,"" Train's self titled album, and Travis' ""The Man who"". An excellent mix of alternative rock with very mild country and beutiful acoustic guitar rifts and melodies. It has a sort of Neil Young ring to it, but it also captures the concepts and feelings of our youth's time. I give it an all out must have, It is one of the best Cd's i can suggest to any kind of rock music fan."
5,Another masterpiece from the master!,An excellent album for downtime. A beautifull and well thought out album. A very personal one from Beck and you just can't go wrong with Beck.
4,Hansen gets haunted,"Quite possibly Beck's most mature, this somber selection of alt-country benefits from incisive arranging and touching lyrics essentially emulating the Mutations approach with even more obvious success. Sure it won't appeal to strict fans of his polar-opposite, and more widely recognized bleep-soul identity, but with SC the artist finally delivered that truest contrast to his party-minded opus Odelay."
4,beginning to end classic,One of the best beginning-to-end albums I own. It is an amazingly cohesive effort. Beck went through some heavy stuff at this time in his life and he deals with it all here.
5,"Oh, The Tides They Are A-Changing","I simply love this album from start to finish. It's a melancholy, haunting exploration of heartbreak and loss, and while I don't envy Beck his obvious pain, I'm very glad he decided to share it with us. I've listened to this album four times now, and it continues to astound me with its beauty and complexity. ""Paper Tiger"" is perhaps my favorite track because of the orchestral flourishes and the way it hypnotically builds in intensity. Beck's voice on ""Sea Change"" has been described by some as droning, muddled, and muted, and to some extent, I agree. He's not a happy camper and it shows in his introspective and restrained delivery. Yes, this effort is a downer, but what a beautiful downer."
2,Dpeths of boredom,"Beck fans will approach and embrace Sea Change as a return to his delicate indie sounds. An opportuntity to enjoy the insight into the artist's love's lost psyche at the time of this recording, but the results are anything close to resemble exciting. Beck does manage to create a genuine standard with ""Guess I'm Doing Fine"" but that is the sole highwater mark of Sea Change. This record will be remembered with fondness as it sits horizontally next to Mutations, etc.., but there will not be a lot of spins."
2,Soothing but kind of dull,"I bought this on the premise that everything Beck does will be interesting, if not genius. The problem is, I've listened to the whole album a bunch of times now, and it's still not interesting. The pacing of songs is slow, and while the melodic sounds are pleasant and soothing, it can get pretty boring. In the middle of songs, Beck kind of made me wish he'd do a crazy Hives-like yell and pump out some rock.I'm not saying don't buy it, and I'm not saying it's not good, I'm just saying I expected more from this great artist. ""Guess I'm Doing Fine"" has some very wise lyrics--maybe if the tempos were more varied between it and every other song on the album, this would be a great album."
2,"Whatever happened to ""Satan Gave Me a Taco""???","For the first time, Beck goes serious. It's not like I don't understand his need to explore his real feelings with conventional words, but it's just not the same as when he sang tunes such as ""Death is coming to get you"", ""Let's go moon some cars"", and ""Whiskeyfaced Radioactive Blowdryin' Lady"". I've always listened to Beck because he was the only guy out there making completely and truly irreverent music - making a mockery of the very concept of meaning in music.I can't say the new album is bad, but to me it's just not Beck anymore."
2,disappointed,"I was really looking forward to listening to Sea Change, but was very disappointed. I find it almost unlistenable - the sad droning, non-stop waa waa waa, and the depressing melancholoy that infuses everything on this disc is too much. And I *am* sorry to say this because I think Beck's work is brilliant and innovative. It is definitely NOT a five star album. (Rolling Stone, Robert Hillburn - what WERE you thinking????)"
4,beck paints his masterpiece,"first of all, i just thought that was a catchy title. this isn't going to be the best work he ever does, this is his brooding piece, his ""all things must pass."" there are no gimmicks, no demons in his soul, no wolves at bay, just a sad man in a plain world. all of the songs can be described as bare, both sonically and spiritually. this is where real music comes from, this is the ""breakup"" album, but there's no anger, no revenge, no motive... just a tired man with a guitar. some of the album sounds relatively like the Allman Brothers' ballads like ""Melissa"" while other parts are orchestral poems, but all of it is worthy of the anguished works of other artists, the ones you just love to play when stuff goes wrong at the end of day. it's a trip down Beck's lonely highway, and where it leaves you is up to you."
4,Not Bad,"I have heard of beck for along time before I bought this album. I prefer more alternative music. Being that Beck remakes almost every genre into his omn thing. I figure I'd buy this. The songwriting is great, Beck is amazing at that. The music may sound dull. If you want his more funk sound, this album isn't for you. I didn't expect this to be mellow, but it suits me just fine."
5,The Only CD I Want to Listen to Right Now!,"Ohmygod! If you love beautiful things, and your heart has leanings for music and art of a quiet, plaintive, heartfelt bent, then please, please, please buy this album! Not since the Cure's DISINTEGRATION have I put on a CD that won't come off until I become saturated with the sound. On the way to work this morning, I rolled up the windows and kept turning up Beck until my world became flooded with gorgeous waves of liquid sadness. I've never experienced a musician who was so utterly fearless. The result is not wallowing like some would have you believe, but rather cathartic and uplifting. I wouldn't trade it for anything right now..."
1,I though it..,I bought it think there was more then I k new but it really was good but boring and I read it once and sold it for a better book.
1,boring,"I have to read this book for an ap course in school, and I found the book to be really boring. It's good information, but it's very difficult to read and stay focused. It reads like a textbook."
5,Bedroom Vanity Set,"I purchased this Bedroom Vanity Set for my wife. It was a perfect Vanity Set for her and she loved it.Before I purchased the Set, I wanted one that was easy to put together and to match our Oak stained walls in the bedroom. I looked at several reviews from other customers and felt comfortable with their responses.I am very happy with this purchase and it was easy to put together. If you are looking for a Bedroom Vanity Set, this is the one!"
5,THIS FIGURE ROCKS,"The Rohirrim soldier action figure is great. He has great detail; his armor have pictures of horses on it. His greaves, shoulder-guards and vambraces do a good job of covering his joints. His mail-coat and removable helm are really cool. He comes with a green Rohirrim cloak lined with gold; a silver, gold and blue shield with a strap; and a sword with strapped-on scabbard. He also comes with a Rohirrim spear that has an attachable spear shaft; NOT A STAFF. The attachable spear shaft makes the spear fourteen feet in height (to the action figure).This is one of my favorite action figures and would recommend this to a LOTR fan or collector."
4,Riders of Rohan,"This toy is personally one of my favorites!His face is really detailed like he was acctualy fighting.He comes with a sword,a sheild,a spear with extension,a removeable helm(helmet),and a green cape.I like to make him fight my Uruk-hai.THIS IS 1 OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Unbelievable!,"I bought this mainly for the feature film ""The Little Princess"" but thought the shorts from the earliest days of Shirley Temple's career would be entertaining for the 5 year old for whom it was purchased. I'm so glad I watched it with her as I was able to continually skip scenes. I'm not real big on political correctness but the shorts were completely offensive and inappropriate. I know that comparing the societal and cultural norms of the 30's vs. today is like comparing apples and oranges. But these films were nothing but child exploitation bordering on sexist kiddie porn with doses of racism thrown in here and there. I gave 1 star only because of ""The Little Princess"" which is as wonderful as I remembered. I tossed disc one. Pure garbage!"
3,"Not terribly well-written, but informative","This book, in my opinion, could have used an editor---a lot of it felt like newspaper accounts sort of mashed together. That said, it's the most complete account I've ever seen of this little-known ally of the James Gang.George Washington Loomis raised a family of criminals---even though they could have been rich legitimately, they preyed on neighbors and others impartially, until a brave local constable decided to put a stop to their shenanigans. Present-day Loomises are mostly ashamed of this, and the gang is little-known outside of its old haunts in Central Upstate New York."
5,Song at end between Jess and Joe on football field,"I am begging anyone at all to help me.I know this has been asked before repeatedly but if anyone knows the title of the song (possibly Indian) at the end where Jess finds Joe in the dark on the football field I would love you forever if you told me.Not only is this my favourite piece of music, but i also I feel this is the ultimate piece for conveying powerful emotions and meaning and shows us how we should appreciate everything we have.Help me please find it."
3,Song while Jess tells Joe she can go to California,"I thought the soundtrack to ""Bend it Like Beckham"" had quite a few really good songs, but I was disappointed that more Indian songs weren't included. Does anyone know what the song is called when Jess runs up to Joe at the soccer field to tell him that she can go to school in California?"
3,Not what I wanted...,"If you like pop/dance you'll like this cd, but my fam was thrilled by the brilliant Indian (NOT Native American) music used in the home and wedding sequence. Nothing there.Don't buy if you are wanting that great native stuff but if dance is what you want, buy ahead."
4,song played in German club,"I loved the movie and, as of yet, have not boughten the soundtrack. I was wondering if someone could tell me what song it is that is played while the girls are dancing in the club in Germany? From what I can tell it is not on any of the soundtracks. Thank you."
5,Buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great soundtrack! Great variety of hit songs! Listen to ""Inner Smile"" by Texas. Being a long time fan, it's great to see them get the exposure they deserve. Hopefully the US will recognize this great band and Sharleen's incredible voice :)"
3,Haven't Purchased Because...,"Hi there. I know it's lame to write a review if you haven't purchased but I'm so glad I read the song list beforehand. The value of this CD for me would be the songs, ""She's a Lady,"" and of course, Curtis Mayfield's, ""Move on Up,"" and I am very disappointed neither is on the soundtrack(s), as far as I know. I really loved the drill and game sequences with the whole team in motion (girl power!!!) and wanted to remember them with the songs. What a disappointment. I mean, ""Hot, hot, hot,"" is a fun song but it was used for the OUT TAKES! C'mon! And I agree about the comment prior that dialogue is irritating over time (unless it's REALLY short and funny). Otherwise, definitely see the movie repeatedly...I may buy it for family!"
4,a fine debut from Mexico City,"Those that enjoy ska and are interested in tapping into the Latin music market should definitely check out Maldita Vecindad. Those already in tune with rock en Espanol may already know of the group's popularity. This debut excited many in Mexico and rippled over into other countries. The band even caught the attention of Jane's Addiction from Los Angeles, who invited Maldita to open up for them in December 1990. I recommend this album or the following ""El Circo"" as a beginning to familiarize yourself with the awesome power of Maldita Vecindad. If the home recording doesn't grab you, their extremely energetic live show will."
4,great racing footage,Great racing footage thats better than the fast and furious. I was impressed and Im sure it will impress others as well. the acting is average but if you love racing buy this dvd.
2,Sim City 4 - Disappointing,It wouldn't run on a high end Dell Notebook. I did get it to run on a two year old Dell Notebook. It is difficult to learn and seems to have many useless features like putting wild life into terrains who run around for about a minute and disappear. Control of the terrain is almost impossible because you can control individual blocks. I finally gave up in despair and gave the game away.
2,boo...,"I Have been a huge SimCity fan since the beginning. And this is probably the worst installment yet. It is very hard. After about an hour of playing it, after seeing all the fancy eye candy graphics, I got mad at the game. It takes forever to do anything! I love these kinds of games but this one doesn't do it for me. Sim City 3000 was a much better game."
3,Almost There . . .,"The graphics and detail are superb. But there are many things lacking in this new version of Simcity. The documentation is poor. There is no random generation of landscapes. And even on a Pentium 3 1 gig with 256 RAM, the program grinds very slowly. I am not sure that it is sufficiently different from its predecessors to warrant new attention, while its slowness makes it less playable . . ."
2,"Fun, then crash, then wait, then fun, then crash, then ....","I've loved every simcity game since the first and, in theory, I love this one as well. The graphics are rich and vibrant and the level of complexity is awesome. Now for the down sides....The game crashes mind numbingly awesome. My machine screams with ever game I've played, including massive strategy games, but playing this you would think my P4 was a comedore 64. The game just keeps going down. As for playability, it seems excellent, if only the game stayed up long enough to really enjoy a full game.This really needed a few more months of Beta."
1,Wrong Serial Number?!,"Purchased the game and was pleased with the delivery. However, when installing it I had to insert the Serial number on the back of the Instruction manual. After several tries it continued to tell me I had entered an incorrect serial number. After checking and rechecking several times I gave up and sent the game back to Amazon. Went to EA.com to seek help and could find nothing or anyone to offer any help whatsoever. Very disappointed and will never deal with EA again."
1,Constant Lockups and Crashes,"I would wait for a newer version or a patch. I am so disgusted with myself for buying this and wish I could take it back. The game would be wonderful and there are some great graphics in it but it locks up constantly. I have a brand new computer that I had built especially for ""gamers"" with high end everything on it. But I start to build a city and get excited about it and it either crashes or locks up. I've started saving every single time I do anything anymore and that makes the game not very fun to play. If you haven't already bought this game, don't waste your money. I will only be happy after the first patch or two comes out. Until then, I will be playing something else."
4,Very detailed and entertaining!,This game is very detailed and I like how Maxis made the move to 3D. The disasters are very fun to control and are also realistic. The only thing I have to say about this game is that it's a little buggy. A new patch will probably fix it.Buy it!
1,Best Review Ever!!,"I played Sim City 3000 in school. Me and my classmates loved the game! We all have contests to see who could get the biggest town, with the most people. When I asked my mom for it, she suprised me with Sim City 4. I was so happy! But when I began playing, I noticed that it was not a very good game. It was very hard to get a population of 1000, even when going in super speed, When zoning, the streets were made for you, landmarks start at about $30,000, raising taxs is confusing, and ""Budget Grim"" is always going off, even when taking a loan of $100,000. So I suggest you buy Sim City 3. No ofence to the makers of Sims' stuff, but I think they made a mistake with Sim City 4."
3,Could never get off the ground,"This is overall a great game, but is kinda hard. I could never get my city off the ground, even with doing the same things the manual told me to do. Word from word. It seems that the game just didn't do as the manual or EA games had predicted. I am actually pretty sure that those screenshots are CGI. I did the expansion pack, and that made it more fun, but the same problem. I do recomend this game, but for the stragety game tipe, and ndot the space sim player that I am."
4,good sim game,"i liked this game, it had good graphics and the gameplay was good, yet it was EXTREMLY hard 2 keep the budget in control while keeping the sims happy, but i do recomend this game when the price goes farther down."
2,Just not fun...,"I've been playing SimCity since the original Nintendo release. I awaited the release of SimCity 4 with great anticipation, but I have to say, I was very dissapointed.The graphics are good and all the features described were delivered, but... the game just isn't fun. I sat watching my cities develop (which takes forever) and realized I was having about as much fun as doing laundry.I also found the game very easy. If you have played previous versions getting a big city takes little thought, just a LOT of time. I found I was constantly just watching the screen as I waited for stuff to happen.I hope they make a new version that is FUN again, but I can't recommend this one."
2,simcity is going backwards,"what can i say ,at first i was excited about this game but as soon as i started playing it i new i was going to load simcity 3000 back on.the graphics are great but what really is stupid is how hard it is to make any money ,ive tried everything lowering on funding on all services,making toxic waste dumps nothing works!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you cant really get any deals with your neighboors as you have to make your own and all this gets confusing.what went wrong?if only they had improved on some things and left the [other] things for example the budget problems.if they had changed only the graphics and the rewards etc this would have got a 5/5"
1,terrible,"I bought this game for my Power Mac G4. It was terrible -- not user friendly, a screen that jumps all over the place, etc. It is almost as if the developers -- Aspyr -- put a crappy game out there on purpose.For instance, the tutorial asks the user to ""right click,"" but MAC mouses only have one button!I spent $40 on this game and it is unusable. It is the last one I buy with the Aspyr name on it."
2,"Fun, but too buggy","SimCity 4 is nice, but the game is terribly buggy. Mine has crashed 5 times in the 4 hours I've played it, and I have a stable system. Before buying this game review SimCity user forums to decide whether the game is stable enough for you..."
2,Ok but very large,Hello fello gamers. I love sim games a lot. This one takes up a lot of memmory on your computor. I had a 5 games on my computor. SC4 made me get red of them all. The game is fun but make sure you have a good hardrive.
1,This game is bad news!!!,"Sim City 4 was a BIG disappoint to me. I thought it would be so much better than it is. The game to much too complex. I can't figure out how to get my population above 3000. Something always goes wrong and there is no explanation in the game as to how to correct the problem. I ordered the ""Prima Official Strategy Guide"", however, it doesn't include the information anyone needs to figure out Sim City 4. I highly suggest no one should buy it."
2,to advanced,This game has great graphics. The only thing is it works to slow! Whats so good about a game that doesn't run? Nothin'. It would of been 4 stars if it would ran good.
2,disappointing,"The graphics are beautiful, but the game is really boring. It was a real disappointment when I bought the game. I really regret buying the game. I've read other (bad) customer reviews, but I thought they are wrong. They are not. Save money,do not buy this game! It is really hard to get any money. Everything is really expensive. Just buying a school and the budget turns into minus. It goes with everything, i.e. police station, electricity, hospitals etc.You have to save money, but that's really a problem, because when you save on public safety, the crime rate goes up, or when you save on hospitals, the employees are going on strike."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I enjoyed Sim City 3000 Unlimited a great deal, and I was rather hoping its creators would use it as the jumping-off point for Sim City 4, but they've gotten rid of what I liked about that earlier game and added almost nothing I do like. Yes, the graphics are sharper and are really nice, but as one reviewer noted before, the game is now far more work than fun. I think that's a pretty fundamental complaint, really. I have a pretty powerful computer, and the game operates the way it should, but I must always restart my computer and repair the Internet functions before my system is in working order again after game play. Too, the cheat code dialogue box rarely opens as it's supposed to do, instead, hitting CTRL X turns the cursor into a smokestack. I'm going back to Sim City 3000 Unlimited. I regret my expensive purchase of Sim City 4."
2,Same OLD SimCity,"I got this game the day it came out and I am allready bored of it. It was fun in the beginning, but the longer you play this game the more repititious it gets. The graphics are great but the toolbars are sometimes confusing because there are no words, just picture menus which can be annoying. Once you have built one successful city you will most likely never play this game again. I also think that the whole region/neighbor set up needs to be tweaked a little which might add more hours of gameplay. That seems to be the only major difference between this simcity game and simcity 3000. I would not spend 50 bucks on this game because after a few days of gameplay you will most likely put this game away for good."
2,SimCity is [fading],"I've played since the original SimCity, on a Commodore 128. The last SimCity, SimCity 3000, was a letdown, and after a week of play, it seems as if the folks at EA/Maxis have lost sight of what this game is all about. You now have to chase after every little fire, there is no sandbox mode for creative play and city building, it's impossible to build a small town with a high living standard, and so on.My impression is that EA thinks Will Wright designed SimCity to be a strategy game. He didn't. He designed it to be a TOY. Something that creative types - especially older gamers such as myself - could sculpt with. Apparently EA/Maxis believes that all gamers have the mentality of 12 year old males with water on the brain. They don't.The second star is for the graphics. They're nice. So what. ""Tropico"" and ""Stronghold,"" more modest games, are soothing compared to all this micromanagement, constriction, and inanity."
1,Frozen on arrival,"I have a Pentium 4 1.8GHz, 256MB RDRAMVideo: 64MB DDR NVIDIA GeForce 3 Ti 200This game plays very slow. After playing slow for an hour, it freezes. It's annoying and unplayable. Don't bother. There's nothing new in the game that's worth the pain of watching it freeze every time you play it."
1,Buggy,"I installed it and go to start the game and the CD ROM spins, but nothing happens. I go straight back to the desktop. Even used the online support, but its no help. I have plenty of PC power to run the game, but it won't go. In reading the Amazon reviews, it looks like I'm not the only person with major techno-problems. This game is a big fat pig. Its so big your computer will choke."
2,SimCity 4,"I had waited quite some time to play this game since it had been quite pricey, and yes I made a good decision to pick it up in thebargain bin. Th graphics and sound are stupendous, however it is basically impossible to make money. One keeps losing money all the time and I find it to be way to hard. The previous versions had all been improvements of prior versions of the game. To me this was a visual improvment but at the same time the gameplay suffered a major blow. I was so disapointed after having played if for a few hours and then making the drastic decison never to play it again..."
1,Games crashes and is unplayable,"Even though my system more than meets the requirements, and even though I have downloaded and installed the patches, SimCity 4 persistantly crashes. I haven't been able to play the game for more than 5 minutes without a crash. And tech support has been slow to help."
2,Surprisingly bad!,"This game is visually fantastic and that is about it. After a spectacular and fun experience of creating the terrain, I was excited to build my city. Then the pain set in... The interface is difficult. The menus are confusing(after 2 days, I still don't know how to load a city). The game play is dull, tedious and oh so easy to completely fail at. Additionally, the game does not seem to hook up to any server and download updates automatically. Most games with online ability usually will have some easy way to install patches. Not this one! They really leave the user(customer) in the lurch.It is a general no-no in the entertainment business to punish your customer from the get-go. This game, after a nice terraforming, punishes the user with miserable failure. I wish Blizzard, or some other professional company would acquire this mess and make it the smooth, wonderful game it could be."
3,What Happened???,"Well, I bought the game yesterday, and let me jus tell you that I was really confused when I started playing, because, unlike in other sim city games, (2000, 3000, etc.) there weren't any model/ already built cities to play off of. So, it's all up to you. Now, this might sound good, and it might sound bad. But, I played for 4 hours WITH MONEY CHEATS and still only had 4,000 citizens. No skyscrapers, basically a big town filled with a lot of houses. Fortunately, I got some wealthy people to move in (those big houses are really beautiful.) But my point is, you want to see what's on the front of the box, a big, sprawling city, and it isn't offered in an already-built city. So, someone [messed] up. But, I like the game.... mostly. Great music!"
2,It was OK,"The title is absolutely right! It is a simulation,but that's it! You can't enjoy the game because you have to constantly worry about how much you spending for road maintance or whatever else there is. Bah! I wanted a game to enjoy not a game to add my stress to my life! But if you're looking for a game with beautiful graphics then I recommend it!"
2,The lag is a big problem...,"There is no doubt that the graphics in Sim City 4 are better than those of SC 3000, but the lag you get in return is not worth the relatively puny graphic improvement. Originally, I thought the problem was my computer, but after meeting the requirements, defragging (and going on a deleting spree), and reading similar complaints at both Amazon and Simcity4.com, I'm disspaointed to realize that there is probably something wrong with the game.Hopefully a patch will fix this..."
3,Sim CIty 4,"This is a good game, it has great graphics, but if you don't have the exact system requirements (including the video cards supported), then the game won't work on your computer."
3,Released before its time!,"If it weren't for the serious bugs, this might be a fun game. As released, it crashes and burns to the point of frustration.It's a resource hog. I have a 1.5 GHz P4 with a gig of RAM and a GForce 4 video card. SC4 still runs slow, and crashes fairly often. Upon exiting SC4, one has to reboot to clear the debris left behind. It's sad that this stuff gets released long before it's ready.I also ""tested"" SC4 on a 700 MHz P3 with 256 meg of RAM. It was unplayable. Taking the RAM up to 512 meg helped. 1 gig of RAM seems to be the point at which the game actually starts working decently.So, how long do we have to wait on the patch?Famous Programmer,Ted Dead"
1,"I loved the Simcity series, but they need to change it","I enjoyed the Simcity games and felt ripped off with Simcity 3000 as it was basically the same package as the previous Simcity. If you love the basic city building concepts of the Simcity games, Simcity 4 is the exact same thing. At least they changed the graphics for this one and gave it an updated look for today's video cards but if you look at screenshots for Simcity 4 you'll see that it has the same rules, building types, etc. If you'd like to play Simcity again with an updated graphics engine, go for this title, but if you've been ""simcitied out,"" save your money and buy another title. Sims anything sells like hotcakes and EA realizes this. It's another attempt to cash in on the Sim name."
3,Hi mom,I'm a beta teste for EA. I actually plaid this game and it sucked cause there are no guns and stuff. You can't nale all those sims with Meterors!
3,In this day and age....,"there should be no games that take several minutes to save.... there should be no games that advertise that they run on a 500Mhz PC when in fact it still runs slowly on 2.4Ghz... there should be no games released as buggy as this one... for instance when a fire happens across town it immediately puts the cursor to that area... if you were about to bulldoze one little square, you bulldoze EVERYTHING.. just like you had dragged the cursor across town. These things are unacceptable from a company such as Maxis and EA. Do not be blinded by the hype and reviews,(those same reviewers have ripped on other games that have had these issues, why not this one?) this game should not have been released yet.... and this is after the April 6 update. In principle the game is fun, with these issues it makes it unplayable."
5,Minimum System Requirements,"Minimum PC System Requirements:Processor Type: Intel Pentium III processor, AMD Athlon processorProcessor Speed: 500MHzOperating System: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me), Windows XPSystem Memory: 128MB RAMHard Drive Space: 1GBVideo: 16MB, DirectX 7.0-compatible driver, 3D accelerated mode requires a supported 3D chipsetSound Card: DirectX 7.0-compatible sound cardDrive Type and Speed: CD-ROM 8x, DVD-ROM 8xAdditional Requirements: KeyboardMouse"
2,Difficult and Not Fun,"Number of complaints:(1) Aside from the technical bugs and performance constraints (which are considerable), the game suffers from a ton of UI isssues (try reading the news flipper while the game is actually running),(2) Succes in the game relies on a level of micromanagement that simply isn't fun (there's something fundamentally not right about a toy that fosters frustration and stress)(3) The rules and simulation parameters aren't intuitive (how is anyone supposed to know that tax rates of 9.0% are neutral or that high density zones collect less taxes than low density zones?)(4) The supplied documentation [is weak].Unless you're a [real] Sim fanatic, I'd avoid this one."
3,"Impossibly hard, but slightly rewarding","First off, this was a ... mleh game. This is a extremely complex game. The farthest i've gone without cheats is about 5 min. The traffic is absurd, subways are beyond expensive, trains and buses placed in the most congested areas only recieve 10% usage at most. The buildings look great and all the graphics are amazing, but the difficulty is beyond anything. SC3000 was a simpler and more addicting.SC4 is still addicting, but the frustration you will recieve trying to balance the budget is too much. BUT, if you pass all that, (i have managed that once), the difficulty gets even harder, powerplants either take up too much space or are too expensive, the budget gets extremly fragile, schools and hospitals overflow once built. But the rewards to see the cities bloom are great. My record pop. is 128,923. Is low for what i see, skyscrapes offices are not enough to get a mil. But still try the game you might get lucky."
1,So disappointed!!,"I'm so disappointed! I've been a big fan of Maxis and the Sim City games, but unless you have a brand new 2,000 dollar computer, DON'T GET THIS GAME! If your computer is one or two years old, Maxis recommends turning all graphics down to the lowest setting, which means you should just save your money and buy Sim City 3000."
1,Unacceptable..,"Simcity 4, in it's current state, is a disaster. My specs: P4 2 Ghz,Radeon 9700,512 MB,Soundblaster Audigy 2. The game churns. I'm sure most of the reviews seen here are either from Maxis trying to save their dwindling game, or people who have played it for five minutes. With my machine, a city with a population of 25k on the largest map will barely run. Days take 5-6 seconds to advance even on the fastest setting, and it is impossible to scroll around and place buildings because of the slow down. This programming is horrid. No current machine can run a large city without terrible lag. Simcity 4 is unstable, and with ANY ATI card, buildings are turned off when you scroll, yet I was able to fix this by changing a few lines of code."
4,Ya right.,To the person who was upset when the game crashed under an 8 mb graphics card.Upgrade. I doubt you'll find any new game that works with an 8 mb graphics card - you haven't even been able to buy such a weak card for years.Thats like trying to play a CD on a record player.
1,Impossible!,"I bought this game, expecting it to be as fun and exciting as my Simcity 3000 Unlimited. Boy was I wrong! Unlike SC3000, anything you build costs money to maintain. Even the water pumps. Its impossible to keep your money in a positive balance. I never play that game anymore because its sooo impossible to play. I can't believe my boyfriend wasted 50 bucks on it for me!"
2,Does not work on XP,"After many attempts to install the game on our home PC running Windows XP failed, we discovered that the game was incompatable with our OS. It does however work on our laptop running Windows 7."
5,this game is great just read the manule,I've never played a sims city game before till I played this and now I'm willing to buy it. The graphics are great and if you do things good in your cityyou can get a good population reviewersThe only problem in this game is that you get polution easliy even though there isn't really any thing you can do about it.Me and my uncle all ways play it to see who has the best city and I all ways do. Just read the manule and pay attesion in the game and you can have a great game
2,I hate it.,"I've tried playing this game many, many times. I can never stay in a positive cash flow situation. I love every Sim Game out there except this one. I gave it 2 stars because I love being able to zoom in so close and see all the people running around. Especially when I got a statue to me!"
3,It' waaaaay too hard,"I've played all of the previous Simcity games, and they were much easier. In this game, making money is practically impossible. You can cut funds just about everywhere, raise taxes very high, but i still only make about a $700 profit, after all that. Ive talked to some other people, they all said the same. They know how to play these games, but Simcity 4 has WAY TOO MANY ways for you to lose money, but not enough to make money. Also, for no reason, half my buildings abandon. Overall, I believe Simcity 3000/Unlimited was much more fun than this game. This game is nothing but good graphics and frustration."
3,"same game, better graphics","Pros:- the original game concept still works- cool and very detailed graphics- improved micromanagement (challenging!)- cool new terrain-tools (really amazing graphics and effects)- new region play allows metropolitan areas- nice user-interface- roads are placed automaticallyCons:- despite graphics, nothing has changed much- much smaller city-maps- region play doesn't work properly (it is not like having one huge city)- I cannot choose architectural styles or landscapes (Palm trees in NYC???)- building highways is still a PITB.- houses and roads still stick to the square/block-system- Incredible hardware requirements- game crashes often- no scenarios!!!- roads are placed automatically (good thing, bad thing)Summary: a good game based on old qualities that impresses through its gorgeous graphics at first. However, it also leaves a somewhat bitter after-taste. Even though it is worth its bucks, more could/should have been possible...I don't think EA is good for Maxis."
2,Beautiful graphics... but unplayable,"I'm a huge Sim City fan. This game starts out with a bang and looks beautiful. However, even on my 1-year-old desktop, the game virtually crawls to a halt after only 10 minutes of development. Scrolling takes at least 30 seconds, zooming in or out takes even longer -- unless it locks up entirely.Does the game really need working traffic lights, packs of wild animals, construction workers, and all the other bells and whistles that make it look breathtaking, but ultimately unplayable? I think the developers have gotten carried away with the graphical capabilities.PS -- I've installed the patch from the manufacturer's website that's intended to fix this problem. The improvement is noticable, but the game is still slow and unenjoyable. I've uninstalled it and re-installed SimCity 3000."
2,Great graphics but VERY restricted options,"All the Sim City games were better than the one before. With Sim City 4 it is great to see the stunning graphics and plethora of new parks, buildings etc. But, unlike previous Sim City games, with Sim City 4 you can't just slap a city together and let your imagination run riot, which I thought was the whole point of having Sim City. You must build up a city from scratch and carefully monitor your expenses. If you go just a little wild, you get fired as mayor. While this is fine, the lack of an option to play the game and see it's true potential without having to do it from the beginning each time is a major downer for this game. Sim CIty 3000 is better."
1,was disappointed,"i loved playing sim city 3000 unlimited and couldnt wait for sim city 4 but as with the sims, ea has made it so complicated that it was not fun at all. I have played all the sim games and am trully disappointed that they have taken the fun out of the games."
1,Terrible Quality for Maxis Game,"Sim City 4 is by far the worse Maxis game I have ever owned, and probly the worst game I have ever owned all together! The game is extremely slow and runs terrible on just about any system. It crashes and freezes every time I play it. My computer is not bad at all either, it fact it's quite good. I haven't heard one good thing about this game either. Go to the BBS at simcity.com and see for yourself. Not one good comment about the game, all complaints to Maxis/EA wanting patchs and other efforts to refurbish Sim City 4. NEVER again am I going to buy a Sim City game after my experience with this one. If you want a good Maxis/EA game, I would HIGHLY recomend The Sims."
1,Why not to buy SC4,"Why not to buy:Game is very slowAfter playing for a while, the game actually freezesBuggy as all get outTook out many great features in previous gamesThe graphics AREN'T better! You have to turn all the graphics options DOWN COMPLETELY in order to get the game to run on your computer.MAXIS/EA bombed this one, DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,Don't buy!,Please don't give your money to Electronic Arts just to be a beta tester! This product is not ready and should not have been released to the public. Save your money!
2,No reason to upgrade to this from SimCity 3000,"After a week of playing this game, my general opinion of it is very poor. I have seen very little different from SimCity 3000 and the game CRAWLS on my PIII 800MHz/512MB machine. Also, you spend half of your time dispatching fire engines in the city, which is barely fun the first time you do it. It is down right annoying the 50th time.Not only that, if I play the game straight for about 40 minutes it will crash to the desktop. Wish I had never bought this game, and just installed my old SimCity 3K for a little while. I just hope a patch will improve the speed/crashing problems."
1,an utterly mediocre game,"The only improvement over the previous editions is graphics, everything else is the same or made worse, like cumbersome menus and lack of customization features. If you played SC3000 and got bored with it, stay away from this one, there is nothing new here."
4,Great price for a classic,"With Sim City ""5"" (or whatever it will be called) being released in the next year or so, I got the itch. I needed to play some Sim City. At $10, the price was too good to pass up. And the game lives up to expectations. If you're a fan of Sim City, pick up a copy. The game has always been of greater appeal to me than any of the Zynga made ""-ville"" games. Being a slightly older game, it means the graphics are a bit on the older side (4 stars), but it also means that this will run on just about any computer you have laying around. It's well worth it."
2,Somewhat disappointed with this one.,"After playing Simcity 3000, which I highly enjoyed, I thought SimCity 4 would be even better. Boy, was I wrong. I really did not like SimCity 4 from the first time I played it. I found it to be harder to master than any other SimCity game. Some people might be amazing experts in the game, but for the general public, I do not recommend this game."
2,Disappointing,"I still favor Sim City 2000 over this. It is clunky, comes with a lack of instructions on what you are doing.Plus you have to have the CD-ROM in the drive when you play. This drives me crazy. I'd think twice about buying this product"
3,Slow Mo World of Sims,I anxiously awaited the release of SimCity4 and have to admit that I regret spending the $50. The game is a complete memory hog and scenes move in slow motion. The airplane sounds cut in and out. My system meets (actually exceeds) the recommend requirements but the game seems to have stability issues. The game is a great concept but you need to have patience and a screamin' hot PC.
2,memmory stealer,"wazz up fellow gamer, this game the highlite for about a week. untill i found out that it left me with a little bit of memory. i tried to download a game. my computor told me that o didn't have enouth memmory. i had to redo all my old files that sim city 4 delated to be playable. i sold it to my friend who claims that my computor is slow, but i don't think that was the problem.the game itself is fun. but make sure your hardrive has enough memmor to hold this large game. hope this heped in advance. maxis good game. but takes up a lot of memmory."
3,i don't know,"i was really excited about seeing this thing on the big screen. i read that it was inspired by sonic youth's daydream nation, my favorite band. it was beautifuly shot, low contrast color almost black and white. after the hours rolled by i started getting impatient. so, it was ok... i don't know, i think i need to see it again."
2,Handles just don't stay on!,"I purchased the 60oz Igloo maxcold for car camping, and after a couple of trips, the handle ripped off. Came right out of the side of the cooler. I recently had the latch brake on me, which I can repair, but be warned, the handles just do not hold up. It does a good job of keeping things cool, and with the wheels is easy to move around, but the handles, which are key to being able to move any cooler have much to be desired."
2,Cheaply made. Both handles came off,"This cooler has only been used maybe a dozen times, but just this weekend the second handle came right off the outside casing. The first handle came off about 2 or 3 months after we bought it. Needless to say, I won't be buying another Igloo any time soon."
1,Don't Buy,"I have had this product for a littler over a year and it has completely fallen apart. The hinges broke and the inside plastic strap that supported the lid broke, thus the lid has fallen off; and most recently the wheels came off. We were not rough on this cooler, although it did get used every couple of weeks for Costco trips (since I live about an hour from the store). Needless to say, I will not be buying this again, and I won't be buying an Igloo cooler unless there are some major quality improvements. The hinges on my last Igloo cooler (different model) also broke."
1,"Latch and hinges break too easily, don't buy","Got this from a local store for about $50. Used it for parties to keep drinks cold. While it does a good job of insulating, both hinges and the lid latch are already broken in less than one year. For $50, I expect better quality. See my photos for examples. I would not recommend this cooler."
1,Garbage,"I have several Coleman coolers, and this was the first Igloo cooler I've ever purchased, as the wheeled aspect appealed to me. I'm a 42 year old man and take care of my things. My 3 other Coleman coolers have lasted 2-7 years, and are still being used. The first time I used this Igloo cooler, the lock/latch broke. The third time I used it the hinge came undone. The fourth time I used it, the plastic strap that keeps the lid from over-extending the hinges broke and the lid just came un-hinged and fell off. What a piece of junk. Furthermore, it claims to keep ice for 5 days. I used it one day at the beach keeping it in the shade, then brought it into a 72 degree air-conditioned environment. The next day the ice was gone. I emailed Igloo support and they wouldn't do any warranty repair/return without an original receipt. I'm not sure about others but I don't keep receipts for $40 coolers. I would never buy this again and have replaced it with another Coleman."
3,handle broke off,"Cooler does a very good job of keeping items cold, much better than the older types I've had over the years, great insulation; BUT as one other review mentioned, the handle base cracked, to the side of the screw, and broke off.I need to write and see if they will give me a new one. I'm very glad it did not break when I was carrying it and fall on my foot!! I saw what was happening and was wary as I was carrying it in."
5,Party Time!!,"We got this to take to our boat on weekends. Even adapted it to attach to the transom. I am small and can even manage it when full. Of course, it managed me down the ramp a couple times, but that's OK. I certainly highly recommend."
3,No problems to date but the negative reviews have me worried...,"I owned an RCA before this and let me tell you that it is CRAP...After 7 months, the power module took a dump and RCA had no replacement parts because they discontinued the model...NICE!!!This TV has a great picture and I have had no problems with it as of yet and I am keeping my fingures crossed that I am not one of the unlucky ones because I have no patience for crappy customer service...I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon prior to my purchase, I would have gone with a Sony or a Vizio..."
1,Do not waste your money,We have owned this TV for 3 years and like most other Philips Plasma TV's ours has the Black Screen of Death! It clicks and clicks and will not turn on. There's an obvious defect with these TV with bad power supply boards or bad caps and Philips will not do anything to help you. I highly recommend you do a lot of research and buy another brand of tv! Philips has the worst customer service ever.
4,Bible Study,"Transformational - moving from scholarly Biblical study to serious personal interaction with Scripture. Asks a good question: What exactly is a holy book? Points out how the ""enlightenment mentality"" and legalistic thinking has inhibited our enjoyment of the Bible."
3,An OK DVD....,"The book this is based on is a wonder book - from beginning to end we see how a city is built, how it is run, and how daily life is in a Roman City. Wonderful, fun, good for boys or girls. The DVD tries to put a story in there - and it takes up alot of the time instead of explaining about how the city was built. I want to see them making the roads, designing the sewers, the crowded marketplaces, the busy streets, the water system! And yet we get a story. True, Brian Blessed is one of the voices, and the author does give us a tour of some Roman ruins while explaining how the cities worked but still, the book is better. Kids may still enjoy the DVD, but only if you give it to them BEFORE the book. And I do suggest gettingCity: A Story of Roman Planning and Construction. It is worth it. I suggest getting this DVD if you are interested in Roman history, daily life or just anything Roman."
2,Warning! Not for small kiddos.,"I thought this would be a documentary of Roman Buildings and such, but it had an animated story intermingled in the docu. The cartoon was scary for my little ones. We're learning about the Roman Empire in school, but this is a poor choice for small children. I'm sure it hits the target for Jr. High/High School Students. We'll save it for later."
3,"Good for kids, too simplistic for adults","While I liked the Mcaulay's narration and exploration of the Roman cities featured, I really was put off by the animated part of the movie. The story line was predictable and bland; I did not like the art at all, and I thought it trivialized the entire video to the degree that my husband and I (both in our 40ies) were close to turning it off. Kudos to Macaulay for his work, but I hope somebody will stop him from dummying down his videos in the future with annoying animation!"
1,You'd be better off staring at the cover of your textbook,"This was HORRIBLE! i saw it in history class and coudn't understand anything. my classmates agree with me. Don't waste your valuble time. You'd be better off staring at the cover of your textbook. Then you'd at least learn something, unless you do that a lot."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"[ASIN:B000RFXZUK Amcor NanoMaxA12000E 12,000-BTU Portable Air Conditioner with Electronic Controls]]I set up the unit and found that when it enters a cooling cycle the compressor made a horrible noise. Called Amcor customer service, explained the problem and they told me that it takes 3 to 5 days to get a return call from Tech Support. Called the company that sent the unit, they contacted Amcor and were told that I needed to call Amcor for a replacement and that it would be handled right away. I promptly called Amcor again and was informed that customer service cannot approve a replacement and that I need to still wait 3 to 5 days from Tech Support to call back and maybe authorize a replacement.I do not recommend this product or any other Amcor product due to the poor customer service."
3,Better than a fan,"Goldengate's review is pretty much on the mark. I'm also from the Bay Area and purchased this during one of our rare heatwaves. Our master bedroom has 12' ceilings, and this did a fine job of keeping us cool throughout the night. Standing directly in front of the unit, it'll feel just like AC; walk away and you will just notice the room is cooler. The nano mist technology works terrific--we haven't had to drain it yet, though it is recommended to do so at the end of the season, before storage. Very portable--slim, streamlined design.All in all, it will work far better than a fan, but don't expect the polar ice caps. I am satisfied as it only gets up to the upper 90's here--but if you live in, say, Arizona, I would recommend buying something else. For reference, we paid $299 at Home Depot."
4,Amcor Nano-Max A12000E,"This unit works great so long as you can have blower directed towards you.Cool air-stream but compressor never shuts off.Very economical as it draws just 8 Amps which means the EER(cooling efficiency) of rotary compressor is very high.Best advice is to draw all shades in room to prevent ambient sun-light,cool down room using whole house A/C-down to 85 F(30 minutes approx.) say,and then switch to this unit.It will now keep room temp to below this all day.Handy self-evaporative feature is a breeze but need to keep hose un-kinked and well insulated(around window attachment) so exhaust doesn't re-circulate.Over-all a very light and quiet unit that simply gets the job done.Can't understand negative 1 * of another reviewer here-must be a faulty unit or didn't understand operating instructions.Most people don't understand that portable room A/c's best function by reducing humidity=Added comfort and cooling is just an added plus."
3,Works OK,"I may have sized this unit incorrectly, but it does a barely adequate job of cooling our master bedroom. OK unit, though."
3,Untested therefore Unable to Rate Accurately,"I received this product and then the weather turned cool. I regret that I have not had ocassion to test it to see if it even works! I know I must, but finding the time (without the incentive of heat relief) is another matter. It will be interesting to see how it works in 95 degrees and just how noisy it will be. I don't know."
1,skeptical,"I was prepared to spend $1800 with this company. I called the ""Jewelers Vigilance Committee"" who Goldwatches claim they are a member on their website. I called JVC and they claimed Goldwatches is not listed as a member. Scared me... I also did not think much of JVC since they did not seem too concerned that a jeweler was falsely using their logo on their website. Not too credibile in my mind."
5,"small, efficient, fun",CLear depiction of object viewed. Very small . All prior good reviews were supported. There is a building going up near my job and I can see them working clearly. I intend to take them on my Costa Rica bird watching trip.
5,EXCELLENT BINOCULARS,These binoculars are certainly worth the little money spent on them! They are excellent! My husband has used them for hunting and my daughters and myself have used them for birdwatching. They work perfectly! Couldn't ask for better!
3,It ok,Cant see as far as I thought you could. Its ok to give a kid as a gift but not what you might want to use for far away surveillance.
2,just okay,"I bought these for my boyfriend to take to football games. They are not high quality whatsoever, which I was expecting by the price, but they didn't even seem to focus for him. I think this would only be a good gift if they were a stocking stuffer for a young kid wanting to play in the woods or something."
5,Great for creeping!,I was looking for a compact and tactical binocular. I really enjoy lurking in the dark while watching people and this fits very well in the pocket of my trench coat. I can watch people so good with this! I really get some good watching in!
1,These suck,"Small...plus the focus is bad, not what I was expecting. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for some good binoculars."
3,"If you don't expect much, that's just what you'll get!","Cute. Lightweight. Incredibly low priced for what they are. IF you can get them set up right for your eyes and IF you don't mind a very small field of in-focus viewing and IF you are not hyper-critical of sharp,clean images you'll be well rewarded. For the price they are certainly something to talk about. Toss them in the truck. Ya never know.They ARE worth the price and would be great for kids. But I wouldn't call them ""real"" binoculars. Yep, I'd reccomend them, just for the entertainment value for dollar spent."
4,Binoculars for casual uses such as tourism,I have both the 8X21 and 10X50 versions of these excellent binoculars for the casual user. The 8X21 size binoculars are great in both performance and compactness. The 10X50 size offers the same performance but are heavier and take up a little more space. I recommend the 8X21s.
3,juguete,Muy buen producto bello y hermoso lo recomiendo 100% es de muy buen material mucho listo sin novedades dloii cur
5,Best compact for the money,"Very well made. Very good magnification, very compact. Cost surprisingly low.If you need something for less then optimum light conditions then you need bigger lens.I have 7X50, for example. In low light it makes a lot of difference, in day light - almost none."
4,Good for kids,"We got these for our young daughters and have been pleased. They are much nicer than the plastic ""kids"" binoculars. They do not magnify as much as a nice set, but they are fine for kids. These are small and lightweight, so would also be nice for an adult to take to a game, bird watching, etc."
5,Tasco Essentials 8x21 Binocular (Black),product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
3,Tasco,Received shipment promptly. These Binoculars were purchased to carry in Auto and work fine for this purpose
1,Shockingly Bad,"I purchased these from amazon due to the very high ratings compared to other similarly priced binoculars. What a waste of money.Magnification works cleanly for about 100 yards, blurry after that. What a shame, considering they advertise 383 feet. Adjustment round is stiff and difficult to turn. I have to take them away from my eyes and really work at them to focus, so a lot of guess and check. This makes the binoculars useless for finding a close bird fast, which is about the only thing you could use these for. Only use I could see is opera glasses or for peeping at your neighbors."
2,Flawed,"Frankly, I've been somewhat disappointed with this software. Lots of translations for the money, and Barnes' Notes are excellent, but there are lots of flaws and annoyances. Most notable is what appears to be a memory leak: system resources are constantly low even after opening only 3-4 screens (this on a 1Ghz PIII w/256M RAM and 30G free disk). Another example is that you cannot do a FIND within a window. The Henry commentary is somewhat difficult to search as you look for commentary on a specific verse. You get the idea. The contents are there, but the execution, the ""glue,"" isn't all that great."
5,"Must see, educative","I liked the pesentation of each personality, depicted very well. All names of the famous building, streets and institutions reminds the history and makes more meaning."
4,"Great first season, hopefully not the last",Great for the first season. Helps you understand and see how our country came to be based on the backs of a few. When you watch you see that a lot of the problems and feelings back in the 1800s are still present today. I hope History continues this series until modern day. I'd love to see from 1920s-2000s and the computer age. That would be great. It was 4 stars because I don't know if this will be the last season. I definitely recommend anyone watch this who is interested in American history.
4,hmmm,Interesting series. It's interesting to know how these people becames so powerful and the laws they inspired to prevent some of it happening again. I'm a history nerd anyway so I dug it.
4,Very educational & interesting,The series is most excellent. I have learned more from the first season about different aspects of the time period as well as how America came to grow so very quickly in a short time. It outlines and details the struggle of American workers and the cutthroat nature of it's leaders. I enjoy watching it thoroughly.
4,good quality,"The picture was really good quality for streaming on my wifi tablet, it was also free so I can't complain! Amazon prime is worth every penny."
4,AWESOME CONCEPT. CHEESY CELEBS.,"Its an awesome series. but i dont know exactly what the celebs with their cliches were meant to do. Could have done without the donald trumps and mark cubans, not bad people just preferred more historians."
2,Playing fast and loose with the boring reality of history . . .,"Overly-dramatized, very elastic with the facts, and the recaps (which happen after each commercial break . . . removed of course in the Amazon version) will have you looking for the mute button on your remote.Save yourself the money and read a book about these men."
3,"Interesting information, but overdone production","This series was recommended to me by a family member based on my interest in this period of history. It has been a long time since I have watched The History Channel and this series reminded me why. The information is presented in a clear and entertaining way, but is filmed like an action movie. The first time I saw the opening credits I laughed myself off of my chair."
2,Too Much Drama,"Looking for history? This isn't it. Although there is some history in this video, it is not a historical account. It's more drama than history."
2,Repetitive and overly dramatized,"About every 10 minutes the program repeats itself like a broken record. It even contradicted itself. And to make it worse, the narrator is overly dramatic and most of the acting is poor. The one positive element is the frequent commentary by contemporary entrepreneurs. If you can tolerate these drawbacks it's probably worth the history lesson."
2,Two out of Five,"Historical accuracy was not a priority in this series. Whenever reality conflicted with progressive legend, they printed the legend. But, at least it's not ""Ancient Aliens."""
5,The men who built America,very well made show that gives a ton of insight into the era and the people. It's full of information they only skimmed over in early school years and probably don't even cover in todays classrooms.
3,Disappointing,"Much as I have admired Barry Humphries work and laughed at his shows,""More Please"" is an example of his total self absorption and prediliction for under graduate humour. One always expects undergrads to become instant experts on world affairs and the arts, once they attend university (hopefully, they grow out of this eventually) but B.H.seems happiest when playing the Enfant Terrible who is out to shock and disparage the very milieu in which he was raised.Okay-so his mother was always trying to put him down and bring him to heel! So whose mother hasn't done this?Big deal and get over it!! I also found his deliberate use of more obscure words to be patronising and annoying in the extreme. He is a brilliant man and doesn't need to do this childish,smart-arsey stuff!"
5,More Please -berry Humphries,"Well ,I guess you'd have to be an aussie to appreciate the fantastic wit of this man who is an amazingly different kind of artiste. very tongue in cheek story from the horses lips.I must read his other books and catch his next show if there will ever be another.The movie Bazza Holds his Own,was brilliant from an aussie perspective."
3,"Some excellent writing, but patchy.","On the positive side, Humphries wonderful use of language is evident in his autobiography. The sections describing his childhood are wonderfully evocative but I must agree with the previous reviewer that scant attention is given to the evolution of Edna and Les. The biography really only covers till 1976. This could have been a 5-star piece of work if it had had more interesting detail. Eg: Behind the scenes details on the Barry McKenzie films and other movies he was in such as The Naked Bunyip (1970) More information on the books he's published. More detail on The Barry Humphries scandals and other TV appearances. What would be really nice is 'more please!', say information from 1976+ and the brilliant plethora of work he produced in these years."
3,an Ok movie. nothing special,its an ok '91 movie. some highlights. has a very ludget too so proceed with caution as some acting or scenes might be cringle worthy. best acting was by the young actors though. they make the story work. the others are plain stupid and like rejects from a cop show
4,Dachshund Beauty,"The detail on this picture is really stunning. I was really surprised - pleasantly so, when I received this charm. It looks like any of the little red, beautiful puppies that I have bred or loved. It is much more clear than this photo would indicate. If you love the dachshund, you will love this."
4,not bad for the money but very limited,"You just can't expect to get a decent pair of binoculars for this price. With that in mind, these are ok for very simple applications. I bought mine to use at the shooting range so that I could check the holes I made in my target without having to wait for everyone else to stop firing. They work fine for this.They have a very shallow depth of field. If you focus on an object, everything more than 1"" further or closer will be out of focus. If you are thinking of taking these into the woods to look at birds in trees, or perhaps do a little peeping on your neighbors, forget it. These won't do the job at all.The construction feels surprisingly sturdy and the action and focussing are nice and smooth without any slop.Ranked against real binoculars, these would struggle to earn 1 star, but when considering value for money, I give them 4 stars."
1,Tasco 8x21 are a much better pair of binoculars,"Bought a pair of these from a big box outfit yesterday. Took 'em home and pit 'em against the legendary Tasco 8x21 set.1. The 8x21s were much more pleasing to look through2. The 8x21s are clear throughout. The 10x25s are barely clear in the center and terribly fuzzy and distorted beyond the center point.3. Of course the 10x25s are higher powered, but I believe I could still make out a whisker more detail with the 8x21s.4. Eye relief is similar on each, but since the outer edges of the 10x25s are distorted, they have, essentially less eye relief and thus the 8x21s have a wider field of vision5. The 8x21s are more compact6. My 8x21s are every bit as clear as my more expensive and much larger and heavier Barska Atlantic 8x32s. The only benefit to the larger pair is the larger field of vision7. The Tasco 10x25s might be the worst pair of binoculars I have ever had the displeasure of peering through. I returned them within about an hour of purchase"
3,ok,not as strong as i needed but did not realize it so it is still in the box. not sure what to do with it.
1,Definately Not for kids.,I bought these binoculars for my 9 yr old son for Christmas. He took them to a friends house to show them off the day after Christmas. One drop onto the ground and they have become inoperable. Eyepiece popped off and does not go back together properly. I guess I got what I paid for.
4,Works great,Verry happy with these binoculars purchases them for work to view sku numbers on boxes stored of er 12 feet high
4,Good Binoculars for the Money,I ordered these as a gift for my wife to use on the beach and she likes them. They seem to be good quality and fold up nicely to minimize space.
4,For less range,If you are planing to buy for lss range to watch birds or something else this is better I am happy with this.
3,A great Man,"I know Conrad Walker and he is a sweet, wonderful man. The book is a slow, easy read. I enjoyed it and read it at my own pace. I could pick it up and put it down easily."
2,Didn't do the job,"Looked for latex protection wipes, and thought I was getting the same product I had been using. (from the description provided) These showed up, and did not they did not offer the level of protection that I was accustom to."
2,Like it but wish they had send it in a bigger box!,"When I recieved this cap first thing I thought the box was too small and then I realized that the cap was so twisted in and then I got it out of the box and the cap didn't have any shape so I tried to fix it putting a small towel on it and i left it there for a while but it was still the same, I bought this for my husband 'cause he likes the Texas Rangers but he is so disappointed that he won't use it 'cause the cap it's all out of shape."
3,Logo is off-centered,"I purchased a size 7 3/8, and the hat itself is tall. Yes, tall. It comes about a quarter inch off the top of my head even when the hat is completely pull down. Also, the logo is not centered correctly and this could just be due to the hat itself. I suggest going to the mall to buy this hat, so you can see what it looks like on you."
3,Lesser McEwan Is Still Pretty Good,"This is not up to the standard of later works such as Amsterdam, Atonement, and Saturday, but is nonetheless worth a look-see. The book is beautifully written, but the conclusion feels more forced, less skillfully worked out than in the later works. There is no question that the tension builds inexorably (a McEwan hallmark)but one senses the hand of the novelist here rather than the vicissitudes of fate. But even lesser McEwan is still better than what most other ""serious"" novelists are producing these days."
2,tedious and gruesome,It read like slow motion and lacked true intrigue. Very unclear about the direction it was going but quietly became gruesome and unresolved.
1,Hollow,"McEwan is always good at describing the setting in fine detail, but when it comes to rendering his characters they often come off as intellectual, emotionless and hollow. The menacing scenes leading up to the climax are somewhat interesting but the ending is listless."
3,The Dark Side of Traveling,"I have to admit that I have not been struck by any of Ian McEwan's novels. I remember reading ATONEMENT and AMSTERDAM with anticipation and was somewhat disappointed.McEwan, as in his other works, surely looks at the dark side of life and romance. THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS is even darker than the other works that I've read. During a time when travelers are already leary of traveling and other travelers, ""Comfort"" adds even a darker deminsion.This is a book that I surely would not have finished had I been reading it in hard copy. However, narrator Simon Prebble, does a wonderful job or acting out the parts and captivating the listener.There are many lurid and dark underlying themes to this work. It makes one reflect on relationships and love but not always in a comforting manner.My warning is, read it at your own risk and surely not close in time to a vacation at a seaside resort."
1,A Big Waste of Time,"This is one of the worst novels I have ever read in mylife. The plot is totally unconvincing and extremely boring, and thereis no character development. The British couple cannot find a bottle of water to drink in the whole city of Venice, they wake up naked in a strange place and do not wonder where they are, the reader has no clue why they are bored with each other until they meet the sado-masochistic couple, endless and wordy descriptions of Venice, a woman who enjoys it when her husband breaks her ribs. Give me a break! If you want to read good modern British fiction writers, try Graham Greene, Anthony Burgess, John Fowles, Martin Amis, and of course, Salman Rushdie. McEwan is a waste of time, including his Amsterdam in which it is not difficult for the reader to guess the ending and again there is basically no character development."
2,Wretched waste of a tree,"I enjoy the Gothic genre of literature but unfortionatly for McEwan I had a very hard time swallowing the premice of this particular book. The fact that a couple would continue to go back to a person that had stripped them of their dignity strikes me as inconceivable. To put it simply, this book was a waste of a good tree!"
1,Frightening and Bleak,"I think this book is atmospheric and frightening. It is also very ugly. With all the talk about how haunting,"" and ""stylish"" the book is, I think it's only fair to warn the reader that, without going into specifics, it's about homosexual rape and torture."
2,Dissapointing!,"I found The Comfort of Strangers to be dissapointing. At points the use of symbolism by the writer was so blatent it became mundane. For example when Colin and Mary first meet Robert they notice he is wearing a tiny razor blade around his neck. Many events in the plot were left frustratingly unexplained, instead of creating mystery, they cause the story to become unbelievable. One of these such instances is when Colin and Mary see Caroline waving to them on the balcony, although reluctant, they go to visit her. The author offers little more than a vague explanation for this fatal mistake. However although the plot is lacking and tends to lag in areas, the writing does have flashes of brillance. My favourite part in the novel is when Robert describes the ritualitic way his father groomed himself. Ultimately, I think the issues that The Comfort of Strangers raises, are far more interesting to ponder than the book is to read."
4,Fine piece of dark fiction.,"I ""discovered"" Ian McEwan a few years ago. From my reading I think that you can draw a dividing line through his works. The latter works are literary and refined and seem to me to be character studies that dwell on the inner thoughts and (abnormal) psychology of the characters. On Chesil Beach and Solar are good examples. Prior to that, he wrote short, dark, disturbing novels in which, even though you could tell where the story was going, you couldn't look away. I am thinking of Enduring Love, Amsterdam, and the classic The Cement Garden. The Comfort of Strangers clearly falls into the this latter category and I really enjoyed it."
4,Disturbing & unforgettable,"Honestly, I think of this book as a watered down (& much shorter) take on the Paul Bowles novel Up Above the World. With that in mind, McEwan's story is much tighter. Like Bowles tale, a traveling couple meet some seemingly sophisticated & interesting people, but as time goes on, they realize that these new friends have less than good intentions. Now, of course, it's too late. This one was actually made into a fairly good movie starring Natassia Richardson. A very good read but definitely not a book to read on vacation!"
3,"Not his best, but still engrossing","I read this book very quickly, but was left scratching my head at the end. What did the main characters really come away with after this? I have read most of McEwan's works, and although interesting and well written, not up to his usual, IMO."
3,Wierder things happen!,I try not to read any books that contain violence. Therefore I would not have ordered this book had I any inkling it would go in this direction! There was nothing in the review on Amazon to warn me.
1,could not suspend disbelief,"Lead characters are not at all believable or particularly interesting and are kind of mind-numbingly stupid. Plot is equally unbelievable, ridiculous, and over the top. There's just no ""there"" there. Disappointing."
3,"I love McEwan, but this is a weaker effort","This novel, while it contains some excellent writing and interesting ideas, is not particularly compelling or propulsive. McEwan is a terrific writer, but this is a relatively early stab, and novels like The Cement Garden or, particularly, Amsterdam, are the place to start. Go there first."
2,Not Venice,"The writer's ""evocation of place"" includes the interesting observation of the constellation Orion visible in the evening in summertime, indicating a location somewhere in the southern hemisphere. Couple this with sunrise over the ocean, and we are led most probably to the coast of Brazil - possibly Sao Paulo. Why he wanted to locate his couple here is unknown - maybe because vacations are cheaper in the 3rd world."
4,Creepy and Disturbing,"I really struggled with the rating on this book. On the one hand, I didn't like the story at all. On the other, the author didn't intend for readers to like the story and therefore was very effective. The writing is pure brilliance, without a doubt. However, I could have lived without the images that will now haunt the rest of my days for having read this book. If I were rating the book on enjoyment alone, the rating would be at least one star fewer. In the end, McEwan's mastery of the craft of writing won out for me, and I had to give it four stars. This is quite a compliment of McEwan's artistry, since writing seldom trumps enjoyment in my rating and reviewing."
4,Great sense of atmosphere,"The skill of Ian McEwan is that he creates not only lush prose and complex characters, but that he completely immerses the reader in a sense of place and time. In this story, the travelling couple in a foreign land, is so vivid that you feel you can feel the frustration of the heat, the sounds, the scents, the sensations they experience. As danger approaches in the most subtle way, it is unsettling. However, my only complaint would be that the ending left me somewhat dissatisfied. Otherwise, a worthy read."
1,Size Description?,"I didn't buy this because the Product Dimensions: 28.5 x 1.5 x 9 inches ; 3.4 pounds seems to be incorrect from other sites. A few dollars cheaper but this didn't seem correct. Other music stores show the size to be ......Interior Length: 57.5 in. Interior Width: 16.5 in. Interior Height: 2 ins. This larger size will work for my On-Stage Lighting tripod. Tip, always read description before making any purchases."
5,Love this bag,"I've used this bag to haul around 2 K&M speaker stands over the past three years. The speaker stands are pretty expensive and this Gator bag has protected them great. The fabric is extremely heavy duty and the zippers are first class, never getting stuck. I have some cheaper cases where the zipper gets stuck and the fabric is much cheaper. The funny thing was, the cheaply made bag cost more! Anyway, it will fit most light and speaker stands and I highly recommend it."
4,They do as prommised,This is a good bag for a speaker or light stand. I use it for my lights. Since is is a dual it make transporting two stands much easier. But I do wish they would give us a tad more room for the height because some stands are taller and it is a pain to squeeze them in the bag. I hope over the years they last due to the stretch necessary to get them in. A little padding would be nice too.
3,"Solid, But Challenging","This unit was a challenge to assemble. The instructions would not pass a junior high school mechanical drawing test. The holes which allow the shelves to be adjusted need to be increased so that shelves can be placed anywhere inside the unit. I ended up stacking a few components on top of each other in order to get them placed where I want them.It works fine now, but it should be easier to get to that point."
3,Not as advertised by manufacturer,"The mfg website list these features (actual product)1. multi coated rubicon lenses (fully coated)2. illuminated red compass (simply not there)3. waterproof (rubber coated-not waterproofed)The actual product nor the literature states anything about the waterproofing, while the mfg website does. Moving past the disappointment over the ""best features for the price"" deal I thought I got, the binocs are ...ok. Feel good in the hands, diopter adjustment is firm, focusing is fast-details and images are bright and crisp. Near focus seems to be about 15 ft. Strap seems flimsy. The lens caps are not attached to the binocs themselves, so it's a matter of time till I lose them. They will be good for my light birdwatching, night sky viewing, and mountain vacations."
3,Pyramid overtaken by recent research,"The dvd does an outstanding job of explaining the most accepted theory of how the Khufu pyramid was constructed. However, it's ""back story"" -- the evil pharaoh Djedefre (= Radjedef), son of Khufu and brother of Khafre, has been overtaken by newer research carried out at the site of Djedefre's pyramid complex at abu Rawash. It's a shame that such a good flick is now known to be inaccurate; the VHS version was issued in 2000 and the new research was carried out between 1995 and 2005 but wasn't published until late in that period. This video is best viewed in conjunction with The History Channel's ""The Lost Pyramid"" ([...]) which covers the abu Rawash findings."
2,"Ok, but far from the best",These plastic/vinyl pants are fair. They really didnt do a very good job at controlling leaks. They were smaller in dimensions than expected. The crotch width wasnt enough to cover even a very thin disposable diaper. And they didnt ride high enough in either the front or the back to be effective. I would not buy them again. i would probly order a pair of leakmasters.
4,way larger than excpected,These were way larger than expected. They also advertised buy one pack get one free. Which did not happen. I guess if you use cloth diapers they might fit better. But are too large to stop leaks over disposable diapers. Maybe order a size smaller.
3,good,not a bad plastic panty for the price it is a good deal.Hand wash and hang to dry they will last awhile....
4,an impressive movie i've ever seen,"i've seen this movie before i bought the dvd.i want to collect it, here it is.if it has chinese(traditional) subtitle, it will be the best of my collection!"
1,Yawner,"I am too simple a person to understand anything that happened. I forced myself to finish it. Boring action, boring dialog."
2,"Long, Slow - Yes. A Masterpiece? Er...","Watching this movie while sleepy will induce coma!Do not watch while depressed!Now I have seen Solaris (I read the book first, and I actually liked it) and that film is more exciting than Stalker. To make matters worse, it seems that Stalker was filmed in a tank of dirty water.What is this film about? As far as I can tell its about peole being affected by some place called the ""Zone"". Sounds like a good premise? Yes, well it would be if it was'nt so boring. Seriously, this movie works better than most sleep aids. I was out like a light after 30 minutes, but the glass of water I was holding woke me up.I'm sure there is a perfect time to watch this film, but I have no idea when that will be. Rent this and have the FF button handy while you watch."
1,Worst movie ever!,"This is definitely the worst movie I have seen, it was so bad that I recommended it to my friend and I saw it again with him and we laughed and mouned as we tried to endure this 2-and-a-half-hour horror! Do NOT try to watch this film! And don't even think about buying it... Unless you are an ""artist freak"" who think you're cool by pretending to like this crap. I say this, and I usually don't feel this way, I am a movie-fan myself. And I usually love slow movies, 2001 is one of my favourites, but this one is totally uninteresting! You couldn't care less about the characters OR the story (which could in fact have been interesting, but no no, let's make it boring as hell instead)."
5,My Favorite Film of All Time,"I am completely in love with Stalker for reasons that I can't fully understand. There are parts that should be mind-numbingly boring, yet they aren't. The film's essential narrative could be communicated in half an hour, yet not one of the film's mesmerising 162 minutes seems wasted. One would not expect filth and decay to be heart-rendingly beautiful, yet I'd watch Tarkovsky photographing filthy water and discarded nuclear bombs over some [...] filming the Amazon rainforest any day."
3,"For art-house film lovers, mostly.","The cinematography and imagery in the film are truly compelling and memorable. There is also something intriguing about the concept - the stalker (faith) leading the writer (art) and the professor (science) into the Zone - and the journey's culmination, which I think has something to do with the fear of what we are truly capable of, what we truly desire. Unfortunately, the film is simply too slow and too long for me. It drags on for 2 1/2 hours. I had to watch it in 3 installments so I wouldn't fall asleep. So I lost much of the continuity. If you love cinema and film theory, you might love this film. There really is a lot film lovers could take from the film. But if you lean more toward the summer blockbuster, you might not so much."
5,Surrealistic vision...,"""Stalker"" is one of the greatest achievements of cinematography in which Tarkovsky proves his directorial genius in every scene of the film. Excellent casting and settings create an 'old masters' like effect making the film both monumental and personal. The movie is deep and it should be viewed several times before it can be fully appreciated. I am sure that film fanatics will add ""Stalker"" to their 'best movies ever made' lists. If you saw and liked this film, you may be also be attracted to Tarkovsky's ""Solaris""."
3,The ultimate Russian road movie,"The Bottom Line:In an American road movie you travel along a path and stop to meet interesting characters, in this Russian version you travel along a path and stop to have long, tedious philosophical conversations; while many of the images the film presents (the sepia-toned world, tanks festooned with ivy and overgrowth) are beautiful, it seems that so much more could have been done with the science-fiction premise that would have made the film less staid and soporific.2.5/4"
2,letterbox? NO!!!,If ever a movie needed to be letterboxed this is it. A visually beautiful film. Why Creiterion which releases movies in letterbox failed to do so here is tragic. I saw this movie on TCM and it was. I would give the movie 5 stars except for this.
3,Stalker,"I didn't like this film at first, and was very dissapointed by the ending, but in retrospect, I think I would like to view it again, as I really enjoyed the mood of the film.The film has an interesting soundtrack."
2,Warning,This is NOT the widescreen version of the film. Only the widescreen version does justice to the landscape Tarkovsky creates for the viewer.
3,"Its not bad, I guess","This movie would qualify as ok in my book. I would consider myself a pretty big fan of sci-fi movies and I think I appreciate a pretty wide range of cinema. This movie while very cerebral and thought provoking can also be extremely, incredibly slow. Some of the photography and scenes are quite beautiful and well shot, but if you find yourself frustrated by long pans and slow trucking shots than this might not be your cup of tea. This movie was definitely ahead of its time, however that was almost 30 years ago."
1,BORING AND FORGETTABLE,"I read the book in which this movie is based, ""Roadside Picnic"" and I was blown away by it. That's a real masterpiece. When I saw tarkovsky's film, I was so disappointed. Endless shots of the back of people's necks, or long shots of rotting swamps...Slow and boring movie...Talk, talk, and more talk. The book got into the soul of the characters, but the actors in this movie just talk endlessly about philosophy. So boring. Now I've heard the americans are trying to make this a Hollywood movie. I just hope they don't go to the other extreme and make it a crapfest with alien monsters, explosions and rambo-like shootouts. I give the book the highest mark possible...The movie is just boring and long and forgettable."
1,The Emperor has no clothes,"This is a long, BORING movie. It's just unbelievable how self-indulgent the pacing is. I cannot figure out how people can enjoy this film. (I have a suspicion why they praise it, though -- see the title above.) Even if you like serious films (as I do), don't subject yourselves to this boredom. The whole point of the movie could have been made in 30 minutes. Instead, we have to endure nearly 3 hours of endless shots. Just an example: There are three men in a field. The first man walks toward the viewer, slowly. The whole trip takes perhaps 2 minutes -- just walking. Then the second guy starts walking -- another 2 minutes. Then the third... And then there is a cut, finally. Next scene: the first man starts walking again, this time shot from the back -- 2 more minutes. Then the second -- another 2 minutes. Then the third... Did you enjoy reading this verbose description. If so, then perhaps you may like this film. Normal viewers, beware!"
2,low score for the video transfer,"Disappointing transfer by RUSCICO, butchered PAL to NTSC conversion. Tarkovsky deserves better! Buy the PAL version if possible."
1,Waste of Money,"I was interested in making ice cream. A family member purchased this for me. I tried on several occasions with different recipes to make my own ice cream only to be disappointed. After years of holding onto this hoping I would somehow find a magic combination to make it work, I find it requires a colder freezer then the one I have. I have a normal fridge and freezer. I'll be looking for another ice cream maker in the future. In the meantime this one will be helping to fill our local landfill, sadly enough."
3,OK but there are better choices for the same price,The product is built well and the right diopter adjustment is tight but moves well. The problem is the right barrel view is only good near the center of the field of view; the remainder is out of focus. The Bushnell Falcon 7x35 (about the same price) has good field of view for both barrels; its right barrel does not have an issue--you can see to the edge.
3,Binoculars,These binoculars are heavier than I would like and do not allow images to come together for persons whose eyes have degraded with time. For users with better vision than me I expect this is a good product. They are ruggedized to some extent and that helps protect them from accidental dropping.
5,Tasty,Almost every cane was intact and those that were not just were eaten first! They are really good candy canes.
3,great while it lasted,"I loved this...while it lasted. After 3 weeks, it stopped working. I also was not able to register it with the manufacturer and receive warranty coverage because Amazon is not a registered dealer. The seller has agreed to replace it when I mail the product back. Just be aware of these potential issues."
4,Nice for the price,"I can't locate the serial number for this anywhere, so I have to wonder where these came from. On the other hand, they are very light, quiet, and dry my hair more quickly than my $20 dryer did. I have medium texture curly/wavy blonde hair, and it makes my hair shinier than I'm used to with just the blow dry, but not really any less frizzy. However, the dryer is very hot which seems to make using my flat iron take longer since the hair seems to have already been heat-styled into a specific position (pouf) with the dryer - my old dryer didn't provide such an effect. Interesting tradeoff, but I would keep the T3 over my old one."
1,Horrible Noise,"I don't personally use this unit, but my girlfriend does every morning, and it causes a huge degradation of my quality of life in the mornings. It initially doesn't sound all that loud, but over time the high pitch squeal that it makes will start to drive you nuts. I don't think she necessarily hears it as the sound exits through the back of the unit away from her, and I bear the brunt of the unpleasant noise.Anyway I cannot recommend having one of these in your home if you live with other people. I figured it's worth warning other people, so I made a quick stop to comment before shopping for a replacement so I can get back to relaxed mornings."
3,BE AWARE -- PRODUCT WITHOUT WARRANTY if bought here,"In order to register this product and receive the factory warranty, there is a label on the box that says we need to find a silver decal on the cord of the product. After an exaustive search, I figured out that AMAZON.COM is not an authorized reseller and we do not qualify for a warranty... even worse, they say that the product may be temperad or fake.I confess I am pretty sad with that."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I wouldn't rate it if I didn't have too!!! I've gone through 5 of these until I quit trying to actually receive one that wasn't defective!!! DON'T BUY THIS DRYER!!!!! This dryer isn't even manufactured by T3 anymore!! I think I kept getting refurbished ones. They all came vibrating as soon as I turned them on. BEWARE, DON'T PURCHASE!!!!!"
2,Dryer is great but.......,"the on-off switch is extremely sensitive and right where your fingers land when you hold it - I am constantly turning it off while drying my hair. Really needs to be fixed. Other that that, it is a fine dryer."
1,Defective item,I had this dryer for about a week and a half. It didn't turn on twice and started smoking once. I do not recommend ordering this item.
3,This dryer is just ok ...,"While it is extremely lightweight and the long cord is great, I've had better dryers and regret this purchase. I agree that this dryer is effective in cutting down the time it takes to dry thick hair; it does not, however, have enough heat to straighten and smooth my thick yet fine textured wavy hair without using a flat iron. It leaves my hair straight, but a little on the frizzy/ bushy side in comparison to other dryers i've owned in the past. I hate the way my hair looks when i use it alone and now need to spend more money on something better."
5,Effective Quiet Dryer,"We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we've tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did."
1,Complete rip off,Dryer lasted exactly 90 days and died. This was a replacement to the exact dryer I bought from Ulta 3 years ago. So disappointing to see Amazon offer this product from this vendor given the number of complaints and problems.
4,works great,"this dryer dries my hair in about half the time i used to (5 minutes instead of 10), and i am not drenched in sweat after using it. i use it with the diffuser (T3 83807 Tourmaline Diffuser II), on the high setting, and keep it very close to my head. it was pricey but it was a good buy."
5,Excellent dual-voltage hair dryer!,"This review is for the T3 'Overnight' dual-voltage hair dryer. I have just used it overseas and I am thrilled that both the low and high settings work on the 240V setting (every other dual-voltage hair dryer I've had in the past only worked on the low setting overseas). This hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers. I also purchased the T3 Tourmaline Diffuser and love it because I have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves, much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends - just nice soft waves. I can't say that it leaves my hair completely frizz free but definitely softer. I would highly recommend this hair dryer."
1,This is unbelievable & infuriating !!!,"My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...LAST CHANCE T3 !side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !"
1,No warranty,"We bought the T3 Featherweight through Amazon less than a year ago. The dryer died yesterday. I contacted T3 and they stated that they would not honor their warranty because Amazon was not ""an authorized dealer"". They offered to replace the dryer for $50.00. I advised them I would let Amazon know that the dryers they are selling are not backed by a warranty because they are not an authorized dealer. Sounds like a bunch of manure to me."
3,Great while it works,"I received the hairdryer in July as a gift and by the following February it was dead. It worked great while it lasted but as I was the ONLY person using it, I feel it should have lasted a lot longer. I have had $20 hairdryers that have lasted for 5 plus years. However, I will say that Amazon stepped up and went above and beyond service and replaced the dryer immediately. Very happy with Amazon and hoping the new dryer lasts longer than 6 months."
4,Unauthorized Seller,"As far as the product goes, it is a fantastic hair dryer. It leaves my hair feeling soft and looking silky after blow drying it before I even do anything else to my hair. However, my gripe with this product is that Amazon is NOT an authorized seller of the product and, thus, I cannot register the hair dryer. T3 actually told me I should send it back to Amazon and refuse the credit card charges with my credit card company. Fortunately for Amazon, and unfortunately for me, I don't have the time or money to spend trying to resolve this issue. I just pray that my investment in this hair dryer, which I hope is authentic, will not be short-lived. Let the buyer (of this hair dryer from Amazon) beware!"
1,Beware! The Heating Element Breaks After A Few Months,"I have owned 3 T3s (Three different models, including this one). They are great while they last. My third one just died after only 5 months and I WON'T be buying another one! The heating element has gone out on every one of them after less than a year of use. Don't waste your money."
2,Overpriced and stopped working after a year,"Although there is a 4 year warranty on this product, the seller went out of business and no one can tell me where to return this nonworking dryer. It's touted as superior with a long warranty but what good is the warranty when you can't get it honored? A dryer this expensive that breaks after a year is no different than a cheaper model that you can at least replace 5 times over this one."
1,Beware! Sold a Used Product!,"I am a loyal Amazon customer, but much to my disappointment I was sold a used blow dryer. The packaging looked conventional. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the white label that should be affixed by law to the bottom of the electrical cord(warning of water danger) was missing. But this is the worst; the words ""off"" and ""low"" were gone from the handle of the dryer, partially worn off from use. Where the hand would grip the dryer, the words had rubbed off! I could not find in the Amazon product description the words ""reconditioned"" but it seems that is what you could get. I did speak, sort of, to a customer agent, who said I would get a ""new"" one. I was not sure if that meant ""new"" or ""another."" It came right away with free shipping and it does indeed look new. Just remember it has a 30 day warranty."
1,RIP OFF!,"This is the worst dryer I've ever used in 20 years as a professional stylist. Arrived damaged. Seller refuses to take it back. They call it ""bespoke"" Because it sounds like the a BEE in your ear. Rattles."
4,Great Quality Dryer,"My boyfriend bought this for me three years ago. The hairdryer outlasted the man! Its a great lightweight dryer. I have soft but wild curly hair that i straighten from time to time. I also purchased the diffuser and used the dryer almost every day. The cool setting is great. Its still has a strong windstream but with cooler air for a more natural air dried look. The heat is not too hot. Never burned or hurt my scalp. great dryer.My dryer literally just broke and I am back on amazon ordering another one. Anything I can use everyday for 3+ years, I will invest in again. I recommend this dry to all my friends."
2,T3 hair dryer,Not the best hair drier I've used it gets hot as you cornuie to use it but I wouldn't have purchased it if I was to look for a professional hair drier that can bring up the heat because this doesn't really do that.
1,"Faulty Plug - ""Seller didn't back their product""","I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about. It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug."
1,Broke in less that 4 weeks!,"Paid almost $100 for worst blower i ever had! Dont get fooled by its stylish looks. The heat was generous but the power was weak and took forever to dry my short hair. To top it off in less than 4 weeks the front nozzle broke off making it totally unusable. I purchased this hair blower for its high rating on an online review as being one of the best hair blowers for the price. I was also looking for a lightweight blower which is probably the only good thing you will get from this product! According to what ive read on Amazon, I dont believe it is warrantied by the manufacturer when purchased from Amazon. Dont waste your money! Will try and get a refund from the seller.... DiscountsJungle"
2,It worked great for 18 months- and then it died.,"I read so many reviews on this hair dryer before I bought it and I purchased it anyway despite the fact that several people noted it died shortly after purchase...so mea culpa. Here are the positives:-It's very light-Generates great heat-Love the extra long cord-They provided extra filters when I purchased it which I thought was a good thing but....Now the negatives:- Even if you change the filter regularly (hint, hint with the included extras), mine died after a year.- It's passing was very dramatic and looked like it was going to catch on fire, and smelled like it too.So it's great as long as it works, until it doesn't........"
2,Broke after 3 months,"I did a lot of research before buying this hair dryer. I debated between the Elchim 2001 Classic and this one, and ended up getting this one. i shouldn't have ignored the reviews cautioning me on this product. After using this product for about 3 months, it's broken; it makes a low whirring sound and barely blows any air out on high power, makes a weird burning smell, and emits extremely, extremely hot air.So, potential buyers, beware!!!!! I didn't believe the negative reviews here, but trust me, now I do!! My new Elchim Classic will hopefully arrive within the next week."
1,What a disappointment,"I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn't really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less. The good things: quiet and not too heavy. The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot. I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning. And, despite the ""technology"" it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced. One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair. I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don't see how this is worth spending so much money on."
1,Hair dryer burnt out in 9 months,"$100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don't bother. If you want to spend the money on a high-end hair dryer, make sure it has a guarantee. This one does not."
1,Mad and frustrated,The hairdryer does not work at all. I have sent 3 emails to the company with no avail. I am going to have to stop payment. I don't know what else to do! Nancy
1,No serial number = no warranty,"I purchased this hairdryer specifically for the lengthy warranty. However, my dryer came without a serial number and therefore I couldn't get the warranty. I returned to Amazon stating the problem and got another one with no serial number. The return process was easy and painless, but they did not pay attention to my comment or the product. It is obvious Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Never tried the dryer."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,Lasted 7 months. In that 7 months it sporatically shuts itself off. Now its completely dead. The manufacturer won't warranty it because amazon is not an authorized dealer.My $10 conair has lasted at least 15 years! What a waste.
1,Fake,"Don't buy this product! It is NOT from an auth dealer. Amazon put up a fight when I returned it and it somehow it ""got lost in the mail"" so they didnt refund me. Seriously don't get sucked in."
1,I tried to like this hair dryer.,"I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams! Not so. I used it for about a month, trying to like it. It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should. It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power. It's like my old hair dryer on low! I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100. Now, that dryer really BLOWS! It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use. At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!"
2,Bespoke Labs hairdryer,The hairdryer is nothing special. It is not powerful enough although I have straight hair. Not really worth the money.
3,Light weight dryer,The dryer is very lightweight. However it did not have a serial number on it so I was not able to complete the warranty for it. I also tend to hit the power switch which accidently turns it off periodically; maybe I am just not used to the location of the switch yet on the handle.
3,Good blow dryer but a bit expensive,The dryer is pretty lightweight and quiet. Leaves my hair free of frizzies so for me it passes the test just a tad expensive. The cord coRd be a little longer and I woujd liek a few more accessories but by and large a good buy
5,Simply the best,This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned. I used to swear by the Chi but this one is not even comparable! Very happy with it!
3,Tutu,Bought it with a exciting while found it cannot be used outside US as the voltage limits to 110V. the intention is to buy as a gift for my gf in Singapore. but have to return it. what a pity.
2,hair dryer looks silver in picture but it's actually white,bought it. didn't use it. wanted a silver one. picture looks silver. returned it. will get exactly what i want instead.
2,It won't last,"I've had 2 of these dryers in the past 2 1/2 years and both dryers broke the same way - I turned them on and there was a funny noise and smoke started coming out the back. It looks like the fan just completely broke off. I had gotten the first through my sister who is a hairdresser and she replaced it for me (that one lasted less than 6 months) and the second one lasted longer, but still not long enough considering the cost. There are limited setting options too, so those of you looking for ""cool shot"" or ""warm"" options should look elsewhere. It is very light and I liked it, but am going back to more reasonably costing models with good reviews over risking another $100+ on this again."
4,hair dryer,"This is a great dryer for curlie hair. Don't forget to clean the filter. I did and the dryer stopped working. so now, I purchased need a new one."
5,Best Hair Dryer EVER!,This hair dryer is very easy to use. It is light and the switch is just under your thumb when drying your hair so it is very easy to turn off and on with one hand. Plus the noise level is very low. If you dry your hair while curling it with a brush this should be your first choice. Even if you don't dry and curl at the same time it is a winer. Great! Product. In the stores it would cost you $175.00
5,FABULOUS!!!!!!,"I am a hair salon owner and this is the best hair dryer I have used in ten years!! It is light and very easy to direct, with a great professional length cord to make it all the way around the chair and then some!! Thank you so much!"
2,T3 Tourmaline Ionic Blow Dryer,"I did not find anything exceptional about this dryer. i think it is over priced and I've had better luck with my $39.00 hair dryer that is 1850 watts. I bought mine though my hair dresser. I know she only paid $80.00 for it, because I was there when the sales girl sold it to her. It was a poor choice on my part to even buy it and if i could i would return it. don't waste your money on it. its not any better then something you can buy at Sallys beauty supply or any local beauty supply house. the only thing i can say about it, is that you turn it on it works, but not with the best of power."
2,No serial number T3 dryer,I ordered a T3 dryer from Amazon because I had one previously and really like it. I just tried to register the dryer and realized there was no serial number on the cord. I should have read the reviews because I see several other people have had the same problem. Disappointed about this. You think you are getting a good price and then find out maybe in the long run your not.
2,So So,I like the extra long cord and I think it dries my hair a little faster but not by much. I don't like where the on/off buttons are located I will be drying my hair and I accidently keep hitting them also it is not very quiet. Wouldn't buy it again or recommend it.
2,Doesn't get hot enough,"Doesn't get hot enough to style my hair. It dries it, and leaves it frizz free, but it just doesn't get hot enough to shorten my drying time or omit the need for straightening iron. It is nicely designed and really light weight, but it just didn't do the job. I'm returning mine."
4,I love this hairdryer,This is a great dryer. Dries my hair very fast and seems to help with static electricity. It's a little pricey but if you have long hair it's worth it.
5,"Amazing hairdryer - no frizz, lightweight","Length:: 1:04 MinsLook no further. See my short video for details. Thanks!Pros:lightweight, arm doesn't tiredries my hair quickly (much quicker than any other i've owned)amazing on my curly hair - I can quickly style it curly or blow it outCons:None!"
2,Dont do it!,"I will say that this blowdryer does dry my hair faster than a regular one, but for 150 bucks my hair still comes out frizzy. I tried to send the warranty and yes since amazon is NOT an authorized buyer Bespoke Labs will NOT honor the warranty. It was too late for me to return. I'd rather have bought the smaller version full price at Sephora or somewhere else, but I feel this was a big waste of my money."
5,People think I got a new haircut!,"Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it's light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I've never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I've spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that's for sure."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I have thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair that takes a long time to dry. It is difficult to keep it from getting frizzy and to have it do what I want. This is the best dryer I have ever used for my hair."
1,Almost set my daughter's hair on fire!,"I used the dryer for about a year. One day I was blow drying my then 6 year old daughter's hair when sparks started flying out of the dryer. I freaked out! I am trying to get a replacement but the company is giving me a hard time because I bought it through Amazon and they are not an ""authorized re-seller."" Don't waste your money."
5,This Year's Model,"Supurb. A career best. A long player from start to finish and the best album I've heard all year. You get your money's worth alone on ""Albuquerque Lullaby"" and ""God Said No."" Brilliant!"
1,From folk-punk icon to pop mediocrity,"Let me first say-I think Dan Bern is one of the smartest, funniest singer-songwriters/performers EVER. I own all of his stuff & have seen him several times (including a house concert before started getting huge). And while I think this album has some EXCELLENT songs (God Said No and Thanksgiving Day, & maybe Black Tornado) the rest of it doesn't live up to his potential.The biggest problem I find is the rock band backup. Someone else mentioned that he's trying to branch out & find a bigger audience but I think by signing to the new label & having the band he did so at the expense of his soul. The music is just too much. And despite claims to the contrary I don't hear ANY radio hits here. I think this effort is a bust.I'm still going to listen to him & see his shows- but I look forward to the end of his contract with this label. Bernstein, if you're reading this, go back to being fiercely independent & don't let others views of your music pollute your vision."
3,solid cd,"i read a review of a different album by a different artist that is very appropriate here. if you like dan bern's previous work, you will enjoy this album. it has a different musical backdrop but shares the same intelligent and humorous lyrics and the same distinct voice. if you have already purchased this cd and liked it you must own fifty eggs and if you haven't yet purchased it i highly recommend fifty eggs as a first dan bern album. great listening in either case"
4,A Good Album from a Great Singer and Songwriter,"This CD goes down easy. There's none of the jarring, too-much-in-your-face moments that make some of Bern's other efforts a little uneven. There's also nothing on here as wonderful as the greatest songs on those same earlier efforts. There's not a ""Wasteland."" But there are some beauties. Some of my favorites are ""Thanksgiving Day Parade,"" ""Black Tornado,"" ""God Said No,"" and ""Turning Over."" And even the throwaway tracks are fun to listen to. ""Alaska Highway"" is a blast. It seems to me that Bern has written a lot of these songs especially to accomidate his excellent new band. Which is fine. But this is a guy who has probably a hundred unreleased songs. Next time out, I would like to hear a whole album of nothing but great songs. Maybe a mixture of accoustic stuff and band stuff. But for now, i am very much enjoying New American Language."
2,I don't think so...,"Why does everyone have to get a guy like this and try to make him sound like everyone else? His first album had some of the best songs I've heard in a while... funny, smart, moving... now he shows little humor & has possibly the most average, mainstream sounding band money can buy. Jeez, can I get my money back on this one? I guess not, but maybe I can save you the trouble. I know no one ever says anything bad on these reviews or they get slammed, but the truth is this is one big fat disappointment. Get his first one and move along to someone else..."
1,Buttons Fail,"Some the buttons don't work after having the watch for some 8-9 months. I wear it most days and it occasionally gets exposed to the outside elements like rain, sand, and dirt."
4,Reliable watch for active lifestyle,"This is my second Timex T41261. My first Expedition withstood kids, grandkids and work abuse. I replaced the time battery once but let the night-light battery die in place before replacing the watch. The compass function will function only when there are NO interference objects and electro-magnetic fields. This means that it did not work inside a vehicle, building, outside near tall buildings and high voltage lines. I remember the old commercials when the Timex watch was tossed into a working clothes washer and pulled out with the slogan something like ""It takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'"" . I have found this to be true. I only needed the day/date/time function and a compass if I ever became lost in the great northwest forest which I did do once before getting this model (scary). The watch band is the best combination of leather and nylon and most comfortable as well as durable (I prep it with skin softener which seems to make the leather pliable right away)."
1,"Performance affected by body moisture,","I found this watch to function satisfactory until the effects of moisture caused it to fail. After wearing this watch on a hot day, the function buttons gradually ceased to work. It seems that the function buttons are not sealed well enough to prevent skin moisture from entering the watch. As a result the watch failed to respond to function input. Eventually, after several days it will operate again. This defect in design makes this watch unreliable."
3,Size does Matter.,"For those of you who do not realize it, don't make the same mistake I made. The book is not a large book. It is great if your looking for a pocket size Mr. Rogers but not exactly something to put on the coffee table.Even though I was discouraged by the size, the quotes in the book are still great, and just show how great of a man Fred Rogers Actually was"
5,"Super, super tiny, and it has a mirror too!","I knew that it was small, but I didn't know it was this small. I don't think I've ever even seen a book this small before. The front has a cool mirror, too, which is a huge bonus.I like how it's organized. It's broken into themes of what Mr. Rogers stood for.It's mostly a book of quotes, but they're good quotes. One that was really interesting was how Mr. Rogers parents, at a very early age, let him use the piano to express whatever emotion he was feeling, and how he thought that was a really good way of dealing with emotions.After mine arrived and I loved it, I ordered about ten as gifts for my friends."
4,good choice,"It was s good product, I bought it used so it looked a little tattered but overall it was a good buy."
2,Not as expected,"First off, this thing is NOISY!!! It does the job ok, but the ""spout"" in my testing, is worthless. Following the instructions, using a margarita, it took a very, very, very, very long time to come out of the spout. Motor runing on suggested settings and all.Secondly, it is hard to clean up. Just not a good choice for a blender. I read Consumer Reports and was going to buy the suggested one, but the snazzy spout on this one made me change course. I regret it now.Only good report, the shipping was well above par."
1,"Pitcher base breaks, and breaks, and breaks","After having the base break under warranty, I see it's broken again! This thing may crush ice, but don't put any liquid in it, because after it breaks, it leaks!"
4,Plastic Blender,"I love the blender, it blends well. I would have rated it 5 stars but I had to rate it 4 because the pitcher is made out of plastic, therefore the plastic may hold in smells. I haven't had my blender long but I hope I'm wrong about the smell topic."
1,Potential Fire Hazard,"The blender works great. It crushes ice better than any other blender I've used. It also mixes my protein powder and milk to a nice, thick, even consistancy. Functionally, I couldn't be happier.The problem is the extremely poor build quality. The gears are plastic. I noticed the black powder coming off from the gears after more than a few seconds of use. The blades don't come off, so cleaning is difficult. Soaking in water over night to clean the blade is not recommended, as the screw that holds the blades togather is NOT stainless steel.But the biggest problem with my unit is that the motor is arcing. I didn't notice this until just after the warranty expired last month (of course!). Although I'm not sure how hot the arc gets, I'm thinking of throwing my blender out before it starts a fire. You should definitely check yours if you have gas oven/stove."
1,"low quality, impossible to clean","This blender couldn't handle ice cream, or almost anything else for that matter. It hard a haard time blending canned tomatoes! The blade doesn't come out, so it's very hard to clean. The spout for smoothy displensing was always dirty, under the blades was always dirty. I had mold grow, despite my best cleaning efforts. I finally had to throw it out."
2,Disappointed,Smelled hot while in use for very short time and leaves chunks of ice in smoothies. Did not work as discribed. Disappointed in products proformance.
2,Not the best but decent,It works really well but difficult to clean. No real benefit over a traditional blender.
3,Cant get better for the price,"With bkenders available for over $200, this was a difficult purchasenot sure if this would meet the needs. But this ended up being an excellent bargain especially given that it's price has since been raised by $18"
2,"Pour spout doesn't work, only crushed ice a few times","The ice crusher worked well the first few times, but got worse and finally stopped wotking. Also, the pour spout also only worked the first couple of times. Not great. And loud too!"
3,Not the best,The blender works great but it leaks for the dispensing spout. I have tried everything to stop the leaking with no results. I have to use it near the sink so that it will make less of a mess.
1,Difficult to clean,"At first, I loved the spout idea, but the parts are difficult to clean properly. I thought I had cleaned the spout thoroughly, but then took it apart down to the very small parts and there was stuff still stuck there!Plus, the container part warped in the dishwasher and it has and inside and an outside part to it, which means even more cleaning, because stuff gets between the two parts.And all the parts were sometimes hard to detach from each other, too."
3,Good blender for good price,"Great for margaritas, smoothies, milkshakes or just crushing ice. My only dislike is the dispenser... it clogs up easily and is difficult to clean."
1,Worked great until rubber seal broke,"I've had this for two years, the first year it worked great and we loved it. Then the second year the rubber seal broke. I ordered new seals, that claimed to for all Hamilton Beach blenders, they did not work on the model 50754, too small. I have looked everywhere for a seal to fit this product, with no luck. So if you plan on buying this blender when the rubber seal goes bad you can just throw it away. Note: I did make a rubber seal myself that works great, looks crude but works."
3,Great power but poor base design,"I love the power of this blender but I'm going to have to find something different because I'm going to have to replace the base for a second time in six months. This part is not covered by the warranty, as I found out the first time I called Hamilton Beach about it. Watch for cracking in and around the spout."
1,Broke just past the warranty,"The blender did its job well at what it was made for, blending. However the dispensing spout really is more trouble than its worth.Its difficult to properly clean the inside of the spout after trying to serve drinks with it, and just past the warranty the spout started leaking so we had to plug it up. You are better off getting a blender without the spout as it is not worth the trouble with this one."
3,Blends well but...,"This blender does blend ice and smoothies better than any other blender I've had. But it is not dishwasher safe as Amazon says. The manual says to handwash everything. With the dispenser spout, there's about 6 separate pieces you have to handwash after using it. I'm used to sticking the pitcher and blades in the dishwasher and forgetting about it so this has been more work than it's worth. A thicker plastic pitcher would have been nice also--this feels thin and cheap."
2,Started leaking after 5 months!,"Pros:1. Easy to clean2. Powerful enough to actually make good milkshakes with ice3. The plastic jug is light weight which is actually convenientCons:1. The jug/blender interface has a seal to prevent leaks but it started to leak there after 3 months of use which just really made me angry because I was happy with the item otherwise1. Although substantially more powerful then my previous blender, it does need a good amount of liquid with it to be able to crush ice otherwise it does have trouble"
4,Wave Action,"It mixes very well once it gets started, but I find I have to stir and move the ingredients around. I make a lot of fruit smoothies, and I've tried alternating the order I add the ingredients, but it didn't make any difference. Most recently I tried adding the ice first, then fruit and yogurt on top -- big mistake. For best results, put the ice on top of the fruit and yogurt. But once it starts, it does a great job, no ice chunks!"
1,"DON'T BUY IT, PLEASE!","I purchased this blender, used it twice and it broke. Thank God I bought it here so I could return it within the 30 days of purchase. I called Hamilton Beach to see if I could get the broken part. They tried to charge me to buy a whole new blade section for more money on a product that broke within two weeks of use. Trust me, you don't want this product."
3,Ok blender,I just purchased Friday and used a few times on Saturday and Sunday. It blends very well and the spout works good. You have to have it on in order for it to dispense. It makes great smoothies.The down side of this blender is that the jar is plastic. The top part of the jar has two plastic pieces together and when you wash it water gets in between the plastic and I can't get it out. I'm thinking this part can come apart but I can't seem to get it so maybe it doesn't.
4,Cheap and effective but some parts hard to clean,I am happy with the blending effectiveness and the price was right. The dispenser part can get dirty because it is not easy to clean that area.
2,No good,The music is good but it looks like he recorded it from another and sent it to me. It was in a white sleeve wasn't even it the original case. It sounds good but I think I deserve a better product for the money.
3,I could have done without it.,This was not a good read to me. I think I wanted tricks and secret I did not already know maybe.
4,Fabulous Book,"This Book was cool. It provided important and useful concepts about the game of Poker. I learned some new strategies, which identified some leaks in my game. Leaks in your game can come from anywhere!!! Leaks can originate from lack of aggression, overcalling raises, misreading opponents and any other number of ways. So this book helps. Many people look at poker the wrong way. They think to win they need to do all of this super fancy plays and mindblowing stunts. Well folks...there are not that many options in poker...you fold, call or raise. So its really hard to do thinks that will just fool your opponents all the time. To win at poker it is mostly limiting your mistakes and getting all that you can from winning hands and minimizing losses on losing hands...that's it"
4,Both introductive and profound,"If I would make a list of top needed books for a Hold'em pro, this one surely goes into the first three. It is the one to get started with. Add Slansky's 'Hold'em Poker For Advanced Players' and Barboianu's 'Texas Hold'em Odds' for full coverage on odds and math and you will have all you need to know for winning. The rest is practice and patience."
4,Very good - Very heavy reading,"If this would be the first book you would wanna buy on poker, forget about it!This book is for someone who's already been playing for a while and have the patience to sit down and understand these very analytical theories... and when I say very analytical... trust me, I mean it! The value is there but you have to study these pages one by one. Good Luck!"
3,Good overall book,This book covers several types of poker so not all of them will apply to your game. It is still a must have in your arsenal of books to read.
3,one of the best,"I have read a lot of poker books and I have acquired a good understanding of strategy in conjuction with other texts, especially from applied mathematics and gambling psychology. This book explains in depth the strategy, reading hands and even psychology in an enjoyable manner. But I think it still has no full coverage of odds calulus and interpretation and math behind the poker. I found Catalin Barboianu's ""Texas Hold'em Odds"" far superior on this count. I recommend it as a completion for this book."
5,"The Real ""Poker Bible""",Read and re-read this book. You will need to do that to grasp some of the concepts within. All you need to know about poker theory is in here. If you are serious about poker and taking your game to a higher level - this is a must have - no question.
3,For intermediate + players.,"Dont make this the first book you read about poker.I did, Whoops ! There is very valuable information in this book, but it is not an easy read, especially for beginners(unless you are familiar with Many types of poker games).Start with Harringtons or Phil Gordons books, understand them..then read this book...its worth the money, just not a beginners book."
3,"Great book, boring read","Sklansky is the top poker theorist out there. It's a shame he's one of the most boring authors out there as well. Great theory, but a boring approach at relaying this info to the reader."
3,Great book . . .I think,"I graduated Michigan as an English major and am currently in law school - I'm no idiot, especially when it comes to reading and processing information. I'm also an avid gambler and dedicated poker player, and when I saw this book's technical and ""enlightened"" method of play, I was truly excited to internalize its wisdom and wreak havok on all those who would dare oppose me. However - and I mean, a big however - this book is fairly close to unreadable. When I mean unreadable, I mean not that it can't be read and understood, but rather that it can't be ""read"" like any book you may pick up. It has to be parsed into the small lessons it offers, and it makes one of my favorite passions - poker - simply boring. Oh, and if you aren't very adept at math, like myself - forget this title. It preassumes a master's degree in diffuse algorithms. However, if you're into mathematical pageantry, this book is for you."
3,Could be better,"I purchased this book upon the reviews people gave and expected this to enhance my game. Most of the world plays Texas Hold'Em and I was expecting this book to teach according to one style but instead, this book gives examples of how to play hands using seven hand stud, razz and other games, which only confuses a person who doesn't play those styles or knows how to play them. If the book had taught it's lessons according to one style of play, it would have been a better learning experience and players who play other games could've applied it, while newer players would have had less confusion."
4,"It is a great book, if you can understand it...","I'm a small time No-Limit Texas Hold'em player, and this was the first book I purchased. I think now it was a mistake to go in that order because it was a difficult read. Like another reviewer said. Treat this like a Bible. If you are starting out with a $20 dollar bankroll and lot's of ambition don't be stupid. BUY THIS BOOK, I would suggest you purchase ""Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big With Expert Play"" by Ed Miller first. I just bought that a few weeks ago and it told me a bunch of stuff that helped my game.-Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big With Expert Play-The Theory Of PokerBoth excellent books for anyone interested in a life of poker.NOTE: THEORY OF POKER DOESN'T FOCUS ON TEXAS HOLD'EM, IT TAKES ABOUT ALL SORTS OF GAMES!"
2,No new info,"The information in this book is good information, however, you can get the same information in Doyle Brunnsons supersystem and Phil Helmuths Readem and Weap books and then some."
1,Not recommended,"This book might have been very good ages ago, but we there are a lot of better poker books by now. I found nothing new after browsing through the whole book, and it was also very boring.There are better books for complete beginners. There are better books on advanced aspects of the game."
3,Given as a gift,"I havne't read the book therefore I have no personal opinion but the person I gave it to likes it. It is supposed to be ""The Book"" on poker."
4,Good Insight on How the Pros Play,Gave me a good understanding about how the pros play and some ideas for my own play. Some concepts take a while to grasp. Good information on evaluating my hand against opponents hands and determining my next move.
5,Filippo Voltaggio Offers Reel Italian Melodies With A Twist,"Filippo Voltaggio's voice has the ability to capture a renewed interest in the ever popular favorite Italian melodies. Each of the songs on his CD, ""Reel Italian"" comes from a movie with an Italian theme or is a traditional Italian favorite. The twist comes in the arrangement and the unique style that Filippo offers in the delivery of these selections. We play many of the songs from ""Reel Italian"" every Sunday on our radio show, Tempo Italiano and they have become regular requests from our listeners. If you want a CD whose music will place a smile in your heart, purchase Filippo voltaggio's ""Reel Italian""."
3,I Thought It Would Be Better,"I bought this album under the assumption that it would be good. It has some artists I'm familiar with and like, but some others I had never heard of and was willing to give it a shot. I heard some decent songs from trusted artists like Christina Aguilera, *N Sync, TLC, and I really liked Sugar Ray's version of ""Little Saint Nick,"" but some of the other songs just didn't seem too Christmassy, if you pardon the expression. A lot of the songs express a lot of greed, like Simple Plan's ""Christmas List,"" and most of them really lack any sentiment. This is a CD I wish I could've listened to before I bought it, or would have, because I know I would have changed my mind."
2,resistable,"I love christmas songs, and while this cd was ok I would hardly consider it a classic. If you really want to get into the holiday spirit but christmas cds by Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, and Nsync. If you like compelation cds Platinum Christmas is much better thsn this."
2,Why call it TRL when its not TRL Material?,"I recieved this CD as a gift for Christmas. Looking at the tracklist, I was pretty surprised to see such great and diverse artists on a (mainly pop) TRL compliation CD. Many of the songs are certainly NOT decent for Christmas. I believe my 2 stars is very fair considering the only songs worth anything on this album are by artists such as Willa Ford, Christina Aguilera, NSYNC, Blink 182, Trans Sieberian Orchestra, LFO and Angela Via. The rest just don't blend with a Christmas mood. For some good christmas songs, look for Platinum Christmas featuring Britney Spears ""My Only Wish this Year."""
2,NOT GOOD UNLESS YOU'RE A TEENAGER,OK THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL CHRISTMAS CD. CHRISTMAS SONGS ARE USUALLY SLOW AND CHERRY. THIS CD ON THE OTHER HAND PUT ITS OWN LITTLE TWIST ON THINGS. LOTS OF ALTERNATIVE ARTISTS. SOME HIP HOP AND SOME POP. FROM CHRISTINA AGUILERA TO SIMPLE PLAN. THIS CD WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR 11- 15 YEAR OLDS. MOM AND DAD PROBABLY WONT LIKE IT. THIS CD IS UP TO YOU. IF POSSIBLE I SUGGEST LISTENING TO IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.
1,You can't be serious,I have one thing to say about this. Total Request of the Music Corporations. Go get some real music.
5,Scanning Electron Microscopy Book,The book came in excellent condition as stated. It also arrived in a timely manner.
4,Nice large format,"I would recommend this book for Orlando fans. It has very large pictures and seems to be well researched. There are three reasons that it fell short of five stars. It tends to veer off of the subject of Orlando quite a bit. There is a lot of information about Harry Bloom, J.R.R. Tolkien, and the Black Hawk Down incident. Also, it lists Gabriel Byrne as Fritz in Haven. That is incorrect, Gabriel Byrne dropped out of the project. Fritz was played by Victor Rasuk. And finally, it reuses a picture of Orlando smiling and winking at the Hollywood Film Festival awards. They flipped it and used it, then flipped it back and cropped it and used it again.But overall, it's pretty good."
4,WOW!!! according to my niece,"Bought this for my niece, who is 17. She really enjoyed it. I didn't get a chance to look at it but I'd venture to say that if you have a teen who really loves Orlando, she will love this book."
4,Not my favorite.,"After reading Kaffir Boy, I could hardly wait to see how Mr. Mathabane did in the US. This particular book, to me, is not as well written as his first. However, it did answer many of my questions and I liked it."
1,"A HugeDisappointment , Self Serving KAFFIR BOY IN AMERICA","Way to go Mark, 303 pages of patting yourself on the back, Boy your arm must hurt. I enjoyed ""Kafir Boy"" and was looking forward to reading what happened to Mark after he came to America. What happened Mark?"
4,Bob's new album,Great to hear from this wonderfully talented tenor again. Delightful CD filled with old and new favorites!
4,It Surprised me,"This item is sturdier then I thought when I took it out of its package. It seemed that it would bend easily but after putting it up and placing the support on it, Its very solid and holds a good amount of weight. Its about 69in long and it's being used to hang wet cloths/jackets/towels. Does the job very well."
3,my first impression,"I was quite impressed with the quality of these binoculars. And like another reviewer stated, the optics are crystal clear and light gathering capability seemes to be excellent. However, I have one major complaint. Unlike my full-size binoculars, these compact binoculars have very small eyecups. If you put them up to your eye, the eyecups rest on your eyeballs. Uncomfortable and irritating to say the least. I get around this by holding them a little bit away from my face. Maybe all compacts are like this. But,if I would have known, I probably wouldn't have bought them. But for $40 I guess I can live with this one complaint."
4,Great for a novice with curious kids,"We are very pleased with this pair of binoculars. They are small enough that our 5 yr old can hold and focus on her own - and she can independently pick them up and watch the woodpeckers in the yard. Even though her hand is not real steady, she hasn't complained about what she is seeing. We are brand new to the world of using binoculars but they really came in handy when using them from our ceiling level seats to have our girls see Hannah Montana up close. They are so clear and compact even in the dark. The only problem I see is the lense caps will probably be lost fairly quickly as they are very loose fitting."
5,Awesome!,I bought these for my husband on recommendation from others to replace his huge binoculars. He took them on a hunt right after Christmas and called me from another state to tell me how great they were.
5,Great value!,"bought this to keep in my truck and also to carry with me on hiking and hunting trips. Obviously, the optics won't keep up with a pair of binos that several hundred dollars, but for my purposes, it should do just fine. The optics are surprisingly clear and easy to focus.Cons:Not waterproofDoesn't have Bushnell rainguard (works great in my rifle scope, but it also costs ten times more than these binos)No lens caps for objective lensCheapo lens covers for eyepiecesFor the price though, you get more than you pay for with these."
1,Not appropriate for very near-sighted people,"I have owned many binoculars over the years. These Bushnell binoculars are well-built, solid, and will probably work for most people. They're not quite as portable or light as my 8 X 21 TASCO binoculars that finally broke after many years of service, but the Bushnells are more powerful.I am very near-sighted [-8.75 (right eye) and -8.25 (left eye)]. I was able to focus on objects that were within 100 feet or so. Distant objects, however, were out of focus. Using the right eye lens diopter adjuster I could get the right lens to focus on the distant objects. The left lens, however, wouldn't focus (I ran out of adjustment room using the center focusing wheel). I just couldn't get the two lenses to both focus on distant objects.I you are very near-sighted, beware of buying these binoculars.I had to return these binoculars. I'll need to find others that have more flexible focusing capabilities."
2,Not so great!,"Well I bought this deck looking for illumination and beautifully written words of wisdom to help feed to my own personal well being. I am far from a stranger to Sufism. What I dislike most about this deck is the very negative cards it contains. It literally has cards that say your life is in ruins,your in trouble ect and so on. Far from comforting or illuminating. There is a way to give advice but just plainly suggesting to someone they are being selfish or ruining their life is not in my opinion the best way for an oracle to operate. There should be gentle yet firm suggestions or reminders in this deck and more encouraging cards to help us live are dreams not feel all could be lost? Not what I expected from a deck branded with the name of Rumi."
5,In the Shadow of the Sphere,"Excellent spitual book written as a fast paced adventure. Similar to Dan Millman and Richard Bach - lots of adventure and spiritual meanings. Speaks to the fears in us all and allows the reader to put them in perspective. Makes life seem much bigger than just my own view points. I now want to reread his first book, Celestial Bar. Great read and well worth your time."
3,"Another place, another time...","I liked this book. If you're a fan of fiction that takes some geographical starting point that is soaked in the supernatural (like ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"") and then takes off on a flight of philosophical fancy, you'll like Youngholm's second novel.By the way, to learn more about the REAL spheres, the mysterious and ancient Diquis Balls, which areperfectly round, carved stones found all over CostaRica, pick up the wonderful book, ""Costa Rica: The last Country the gods Made."""
5,Going Home,"Great adventure.... wonderful insight shared.... good story.I shed a couple of tears of fullness as I finished the last pages. If you are awake in this world, consciously walking upon your path you will well appreciate this book. If you have just begun on your journey it will offer you tools that are helpful along your way. If you are not yet awake.... it will beg to open your eyes, your mind, your heart and remember."
5,Outstanding Bible Study Material,I have used PC Study Bible since version 1 with complete satisfaction. The supplied Bible versions and other tools for study that are included provide a wealth of information that makes studying the Bible not only a breeze but a joy to do.
1,This is for Fundamentalists only,"This ""library"" will be helpful to people seeking to find support for conservative fundamentalist interpretations of the Bible. However, it will be a major disappointment for people looking for either a middle-of-the road aproach or a representative sampling of interpretations and commentaries from liberal, conservative and neutral perspectives. Only the conservative viewpoint is presented in this reference library."
5,My current favorite cream!,"I've tried several creams and soaps so far (still expanding my collection), but TOBS has been by far the best value I've run into yet. It lathers very well and very quickly, and it provides a smooth glide for my razor that has yet to be matched by any other product I've tried.YMMV, but I think a lot of people will be pleasantly surprised by this cream. Its price is pretty modest (not cheap, but it's not $30-40 a tub either), and its performance is equal or superior to those pricier products. I've just ordered a couple other TOBS scents to try out to add a little more variety to my rotation, and I recommend that you all do the same. If sandalwood's not your thing that's fine because they have a pretty diverse variety of scents to choose from, and you'll definitely find one that suits you!"
5,Favorite,I enjoy this the most . Great lather and good aroma not overpowering seem to last a good long time
2,Not worth the price,"This stuff is over rated. The only thing that I like about this product. is the fragrance. It appears that this productwill go a long way, doesn't take much. It dries out on your face very quickly. You have to keeping lathering with water,before you can finish shaving. If you use a straight razor, I highly DO NOT reccomend this product. It is a 5 starcontainer though..............."
5,SANDALWOOD.,"This stuff is great. I've never used a better shaving cream. It smells great, lathers well, and gives a good shave for a good price. Way to go, TOOBS!"
4,"Good, and strong","Quite a good shave, but like most real shaving products, it requires careful use. When used in moderation, it has a distinct, moderately strong, pleasant odor that dissipates in a short while after shaving. The cream froths up quite nicely, and lubricates the face well for a hot water shave. If too much is used, the odor can become overbearing to the point of inducing a headache and scaring away children a block away, but moderation will result in a pleasant experience. If you're the type who doesn't shave with a throwaway razor and an aerosol can, you can handle a little moderation, eh?"
5,perfect,"have been using proraso shaving soap and liked it a lot, but this is perfection. Smooth, smells great, gives me the best shave of anything i have ever used. grab a tweezerman badger brush and enjoy"
3,great cream - old woman scent,I have used several creams from TOBS and they all have a tremendous lather. I got a great shave but the scent reminded me of the powdery smell of my great grandmother. I ended up throwing it away and going back to their Eaton College scent.
3,Just ok...,"My review is from the female perspective and after years of buying shaving products for the hubby.Cons:WAY too fragranced. Typically I adore the smell of sandlewood products. This is terribly 'perfume-y' for a male and not a classic sandlewood scent. It's sorta the Old Spice of higher end shave creams.Seems to take an awful lot to achieve the desired latherOverpriced v. how quickly you'll go through itPros:The built-in soap dish is a plusRelatively creamy v. similar brandsBottom line, there are far better shave soaps in a market now inundated with 'old fashioned' shaving options. The scent and consistency make this 'paying just for the name' soap more of a miss than a hit. Just because it's been around for years doesn't make it desirable."
2,"Great lather, awful scent, and burning sensation","I bought this product because of the great ratings it received on Amazon. My initial impression about the product was that it had a good consistency and lathered well with a badger brush. This product smells nothing like real sandalwood though, and the scent will last almost all day after shaving. In addition, when using this particular shave cream, it gave me a peculiar burning sensation which only got worse the longer it sat on my face. If you have SENSITIVE SKIN, DO NOT USE THIS!"
3,"Your Mileage May Vary, but this is not for me","This lathers very nicely. The smell is fine for me -- not great, not bad.The feel of my shave was OK, but not as smooth as with some other products I've used. (Cheaper products.)If I could use this shave cream, I still would probably choose another instead. I can't use it though. An couple of hours after shaving with this, my skin looks and feels like I have a sunburn. There must be something in it I'm allergic to. It's not the first time, but it's the first in a while. (I used this 4 times over the last 2 weeks and didn't change any of the rest of my routine, to be sure that the shave cream is the cause.)If this works for you, great. I'll stick with Arko and VDH until my next selections arrive and I try them."
3,"Great shave cream, not so great scent...","I've sampled 9 of Taylor's creams, and the sandalwood scent is definitely my least favorite.The reviews are helpful, and all of Taylor's cream perform very well, but I would suggest sampling these creams first because of the scents."
1,"Great stuff, way overpriced","I love wet shaving, with an old-schoolMerkur Razor #34C, a badger brush, and aftershave. The whole works. However, it does not need to be an expensive luxury, and a lot of the stuff for sale in this market is vastly overpriced. That is the case with this shaving cream. It is not appreciably different fromBarbasol Original, and it is 40 times more expensive. That ""sandalwood scent"" is great, but it's exactly the same as in Barbasol. The cream itself is denser than what comes out of a can, so it may last slightly longer, but it's a tough sell, and I very much doubt it will last 40 times as long. By all means, shave with a straight razor or DE safety, but don't waste your money on this product."
5,"Good cream, good value.","I read all the reviews and must disagree with the overwhelming response of ""too fragrant"". Yes, it's a strong Sandalwood scent if you sniff the bowl of cream but it doesn't linger long on your face and certainly isn't overwhelming. I usually finish shaving a half hour before work and when I kiss the wife goodbye she says it's very faint by then.Good lather with badger brush and mug. Very smooth action from my Jagger safety razor using this cream.All in all a quality product that seems it will last a very long time compared to canned blue shave gels."
5,Smells amazing,"A great scented shaving cream in a large, easy to use tub. Tight fitting lid. Don't use too much water in your brush!"
3,Overly strong scent,I shaved at night before going to bed and the scent was unbearably strong. The odor kept me up all night. No matter how much I scrubbed my face I could not get rid of the asphyxiating aroma. The product creates a wonderful lather and I would not hesitate to order again if only Taylor's would offer an unscented product. In the old days possibly the strong aroma covered the smell of ones horse. But alas I drive a Honda. I guess they do not make men like they used to!
5,I love this stuff,"This soap is the best. It's the best fragrance, and it makes a great lather. You don't need that much and it will last a very long time. Highly recommended for wet shave enthusiasts.There are also other scents which are great as well, however, I prefer the more masculine scent that this one provides."
5,"Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce",This shaving cream has worked very well for face and head shaving. Used mostly with a double-edge safety razor.The nice sandalwood smell that the cream has is very pleasant.Recommend.
4,Forgiving performance,"Great product, especially for those new to the art of the brush. Much more forgiving lather than a harder cream, which is to say it is easier to get a good lather consistency which is thin enough to lubricate, and thick enough to protect your skin from the blade. Smell is nice, not at all overpowering, and only lingers for 20-30 minutes after shaving. The only dock on this item is the consistency. It is sticky. Think toothpaste. A tiny dab will do ya, but a tiny dab is hard to get. This results in going through the product too quickly. A tub of Proraso lasts me 1 year. That is shaving every other day, rain or shine. Looks like this product is going to last me about 5 months (though it isn't gone yet, so I can't be sure). Maybe that subtracts from the overall value a bit, maybe it is insignificant...Great product, someday I might buy it again, but for now, I want to try something else."
3,Not impressed,"Positive:It lathers very well. Just a small amount of it provides a very rich lather. (I lather twice, there was enough left over)Negative: It does NOT smell like Sandalwood. Sandalwood is a fragrance I am quite familiar with - I am from India where Sandalwood products abound. So, I know what sandalwood should smell like. This shaving cream does NOT smell anything remotely like sandalwood. It infact smells like cheap Barbasol foam. I am quite disappointed.I see that a few here share my view and many who do not. That could mean that the quality is not well controlled. I just got a bad batch? If so, I need a refund :)"
4,It's a wonderful product,It's a wonderful product. I recommend it to others. It doesn't last as long as some others shaving creams similar to this one.
3,Might not be cost effective,"Although the cream is very smooth, the jars (I purchased several) are never anywhere near full. They are less expensive than the same size jars of The Art of Shaving jars of cream, but I think one gets more shaving cream in each jar of The Art of Shaving brand. This is only an opinion, since I did not actually empty the jars for each brand and weigh the contents."
4,"Great lather, fragrance","The sandalwood cream lathers real quickly and you wouldn't need more than four dabs of cream to work up some rich lather with a badger shaving brush. Did feel that lathering and fragrance are better than the TOBS lavender version. Face friendly and soothing even if the razor gets a little blunt on the edges. The sandalwood smell is not as strong as one would expect, so it's possible they have acted on customer feedback. Good buy for the price."
5,Wonderful Shave Cream,"You get a very close, clean, & comfortable shave. The smell has a very clean, & masculine scent. I've tried all of the shaving creams, gels, & several other shaving lathers, & nothing comes close to this. I've been using it for almost 4 years. Each tub of this product lasts me over a year. When I used the gels or shave cream in the cans, I would go through 1 every 2 months or so. This is much more economical. I get a better shave because it lathers much better, and I feel using a shaving brush helps to get the beard more moisturized & to stand out better. Once you try this you will be hooked."
3,decent cream,"this cream would burn my face whenever i applied it. who knows, maybe it is my face skin type. now i switched toProraso Shaving Soap with Green Tea and Oat - Ultra Sensitive Skin 150ml/5.2ozand you should check out in case this one does not pass the test"
3,Good shave,"I have better shave creams, but none that have the memories that this product has. Still a good product and does the job well."
1,Scent is way too strong!!,"Although it lathers well, the scent is extremely strong, even using a very small amount. Even after a hot shower, the scent is overpowering. The ingredient list and front don't say ""natural scent,"" so it's probably a chemical compound, but I'm not absolutely sure about that. I will probably throw this tub out...Of course, the scent itself and its level are subjective judgments. I will probably never purchase this again, but might try some of Taylor of Old Bond Street's other products as it did lather well.Other reviews have noticed the persistent after-shave level of scent. I can validate that.Way too much scent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Great Product Poor Execution By Amazon,"I order this product because I have used Taylor of Old Bond Street shave creams for year. I have tried many of the scents and personally like the Sandlewood. The pricie was right and i ordered two which lasts me close to a year. I was almost out when I ordered and was excited when the package arrived (i could shave).Much to my disappointment, althought the package arrived in 3 days, Amazon screwed up on the fulfillment. They sent me an alternative Taylor of Old Bond Street shave product. The price difference was about $1.50 so i was not going to go through the time and cost to return the item. It was my first bad experience with Amazon and i was incredibly disappointed. Strike One!! I hope never to have this happen again and I keep them as trusted online merchant."
5,Great product,"Product is great, gives a smooth shave. Leaves skin feeling good. Would order again. Fast shipment. Thanks again for your business!"
2,Pass... or pass out,"I've been using Art of Shaving sandalwood scented cream for a year now. Decided to try something new and less expensive and followed the good reviews here on Amazon.First impression upon opening the container was, whoa! Stinky stuff! There is a pleasant sandalwood aroma hidden in there somewhere, but you have to endure the strong chemical smell that surrounds it. Other reviewers have said the scent is strong, but I was skeptical. They weren't exaggerating. Its overwhelming. I used to enjoy shaving with my safety razor, badger brush and Art of Shaving cream. The smell was subtle and pleasant. This stuff is offensive, and very unpleasant to shave with. I find myself avoiding shaving because of the noxious odor. Worse, the smell lingers on my face.I'll give this cream a star for good lathering and another for value. But I can't go any further because of the offensive smell it gives off. Endured it for two weeks, now I'm ordering Art of Shaving again."
2,Bad scent; terrible burning sensation,"Pros:Lathers very well.Cons:I like sandalwood, but ""ashtray"" is the perfect descriptor for this smell. It's really heinous. It's a little better on your face after shaving, but not pleasant during.And for me personally, some ingredient causes an allergic reaction that makes the whole experience one of intense burning.If neither of those are an issue for you, this might be a decent product."
4,Creamy shaving cream,Great shaving cream but the smell of sandalwood is a little overpowering. Lathers really well although it dries quickly even before I have completed shaving. Despite that I will buy it again
5,Smooth shave,I only used Art of Shaving Sandalwood but when they were out of stock I decided to try Taylor of Old Bond Street. It left a nice aroma on my face.
3,My experience was mediocre,"I bought this soap strictly based on previous reviews for it. It seemed a little expensive just for shaving cream, but I figured with all the great reviews, I would love it. Well to make a long story short, I didn't.Here are the reasons I don't like it.#1 Burns my face. I noticed this after a few seconds. I'm not sure what is going on here. But I was not comfortable with this shaving cream at all#2 The lather it develops is subpar. For the price, I was expecting something better. It is very slick. Don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't call it a great lather.#2 The smell is very strong (as other reviewers are posting). I don't need this first thing in the morning...Now what I DO recommend is Van Der Hagen shave soap which is a LOT cheaper and has a very very light smell, and creates a great lather. You can even find this product on amazon.com. Just do a search! Hope this helped."
3,Not really Sandalwood scented,"Let me first start off with the fact that I like the shaving cream in and of itself. I've only used it a handful of times, but it gives a nice lather and good shave.So, why, you may ask, did I give this shaving cream a measly 3 stars? It gets seriously dragged down by the scent. I've used the Truefitt and Hill Sandalwood shaving cream and loved the scent. Being unable to justify the cost of that cream, I decided to give this a shot at half the price. Like I said, I like the shave I get, but not the scent. You can smell the sandalwood scent buried in there, but it is overwhelmed by an almost medicinal soap scent.Maybe some of the other scents by TOBS aren't overwhelmed, but I don't think I'll give them a try. For now, I'll stick to switching between this and my Col Conk Bay Rum."
3,Smells bad! unless you are 70+,"Smells really old. I'm going to give this to my grandpa, not sure if he will use it but I won't."
1,"cloying, overpowering smell","this product has a cloying, overpowering smell that lasts all day--and doesn't smell at all like sandalwood. this product should come with a warning label."
1,Burned like Fire,I have sensitive skin. Still I can use a barbasol or a gillette gel no issue. This stuff burned my face seriously. I had to wash it off in seconds and never used it again.If you ever have issues with skin irritation avoid this.
1,Proceed with Caution,"WARNING: Do not buy this if you have sensitive skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and this shaving cream/soap burned me up bad. It literally sucks up every ounce of moisture in your face, which gave me tons of little cuts and at the end the worst razor burn I have ever had. I use a Merkur 180 and use pre-shave balm to get my face ready for a shave, and this stuff smells good, but leaves you with harsh burn during and after the shave. If you dont have sensitive skin then I suppose it would be ok but if you do, do not spend money on this but get some Proraso Shaving Soap, which is the best in the market and also cheaper than this stuff."
1,not sealed and the shaving cream was more like hard butter,"I got the product in good time and it was packaged well. I opened it to smell it (it smelled good to me) but it wasn't creamy like shaving cream should be, it was solid."
3,"Great quality. Foamy lather. Maybe too ""old fashioned"" scent.","The overall quality of ToOBS sandalwood is top notch. Good foamy lather when using a brush. Good lubrication for a smooth shave. My only complaint is the smell is distinctly ""old fashioned"" with that musky, leathery, tobacco hinted type of smell. My wife says it smells like a grandpa, which isn't something I want my wife to be thinking at this point in my life, so as a 35-year-old this isn't really the ""modern"" type of scent I'm looking for. It would make a good incense smell, but perhaps not something you want your face to smell like for most of the day. That being said, it is still a very popular scent and a good quality product. Smell is a personal thing, so if you like the smell, you will definitely like the shaving quality of the product."
2,This is NOT a sandalwood fragrance,"Sandalwood happens to be my most favorite smell in the natural world. I have bottles of sandalwood essential oil lying around, powdered sandalwood barks, and other sandalwood products. Suffice to say - I know what sandalwood smells like. This is not sandalwood, nor is it remotely close or similar to anything in any way resembling actual sandalwood. What it smells like is a cheap, musky knock off of old spice. It smells like my grandpa. Maybe in 32 years when I'm rounding my 60th birthday and couldn't care less about how I smelled I'll reconsider it, but until then, I've returned this item."
4,Good Purchase!,"I've shaved with this several times now and don't have any major complaints. It lathers well and allows for a close shave. A small, dime sized amount is enough product for multiple passes. I found the scent to be pleasant, but a little too strong. The scent isn't too much of an issue if you throw some cold water on your face afterwards and use unscented aftershave lotion. I think I'll try other products by this company, but will not purchase this scent again."
5,Makes great lather,"Just got this and also have Caswell Massey , taylor makes a great lather using only half a much as the Caswell Massey ,I also haveTruefitt & Hill which also makes a great lather but it cost twice as much. So after trying all three, I am going to stick with the taylor of old Bond Street. A little goes a long long way. I use it with the Caswell Masseypre shave oil. The two work well together for me."
2,Good lather but...,"I am a big fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond shave cream so I was excited to try the sandalwood. Unfortunately, I experienced a terrible burning sensation on my face after the lather had been on for ~30 seconds (and only got worse the longer it was on). This product lathered well and gave a decent shave but the burning was a deal-breaker."
3,Didn't Ring Quite True,"This is not one of my favorite Elaine Barbeiri books.After all the hype about the telegram, I felt it was sort of a let down at the end. I know that is supposed to get you to buy the next book, and I will most likely read it because I have it; but I think there should have been something further to get you wondering who sent it. There are only so many characters in the book, so I think It's obvious who sent it.The book started off well enough, but I found it lagging in the romance department. Some of the situations didn't ring true, ie; Jace being offered the sheriff's job when he had been in prison for five years. Being as he had never been acquitted for the crime, could he be a sheriff?"
3,An enjoyable beach read,"Reunion has two re-release novels in one book. The first book `Once More with Feeling' tells the story of two musicians who meet again after five years to start there love affair all over again. The second book `Treasures Lost, Treasures Found' has a entertaining reunion story based around a treasure hunt. Both are fast fun `typical' romance stories."
2,Only if it's your bag,"I read this book for a class, and it is by far the dryest material I have ever read. It took me multiple attempts to stay awake through, let alone understand, each and every chapter. If this is your area of interest, then yes, Walzer has some bright insight and knows his stuff. But if you're not a pacifist/poli-sci/conflict resolution-type person, by all means don't waste your time. Professors: please think twice before throwing this at your students."
5,A classic in its field,"This is an erudite work examining the philosophical subtelties and ethical issues that war evokes. Any one seriously interested in war, applied ethics, political philosophy, and international relations should be familiar with the arguments Walzer uses. The historical examples are standard dilemmas and problems which are useful in class discussions in philosophy as well as history. The only critique I have of the book (which I often use for my own philosophical writing) is that Walzer's ethical examination of war ends with nuclear war--in this I think he is wrong, we should not stop our analysis even with the nightmare scenario of a holocaust, for that is to give the moral hand over to those who would use nuclear arms. The book is challenging and insightful and deserves further reprints."
3,It's alright,"The book itself is fine, although it can be kinda dry throughout, but the problem with the book is it really just states a lot of things that most critical thinkers have already thought about on their own. Although here are also lots of interesting stories within each chapter. If you like Justice or need it for class go ahead and buy it."
5,Excellent analysis of moral issues raised by war,"This book is superb. Among other topics, it considers the morality of initiating armed force, the moral limits on the use of force in wartime, and individual responsibiity for war crimes. The writing is very clear and the use of historical examples brings the philosophical discussion down to earth."
2,disatisfied with sound quality,"If possible, try to locate earlier issue on the witch and warlock label,they haveadded reverb to the whole mix,multitracked the vocal and cut the bass on this issue."
1,Truth at Any Cost: Ken Starr and the Unmaking of Bill Clint,"As someone who kept up with Clinton's impeachment by reading the Washington Post as well as the books by Isikoff and Toobin, I expected to have a very strong reaction (pro or con) to this book but was surprised to find myself instead simply bored by the generally superficial repetitive nature of the information provided. I would recommend this book to anyone who for one reason or another slept through the impeachment the first time around."
3,Look Between the Lines,"This book is very well researched and tells a whole lot about the investigation of President Clinton. Ostensibly the point of view is very forgiving toward Starr & Co. and vilifies Clinton et al. However, amidst the entire righteous warrior vs power run amok blather, there are clear indications of the true nature of the investigation. After reading this book I am left with the sense that the lack of popularity of the OIC and Starr is completely justified. Here is a group of ego-driven individuals who have one thing in mind:""...get the guy."" And now knowing that 200 FBI agents were assigned to this investigation at the very time al-Qaida terrorist cells were being formed, within the jurisdiction of the FBI, for the 9/11 attacks, I am very jaded about this investigation indeed."
1,"Ken Starr, another rightwing hack masking Bush/Cheney !!!",Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief !
1,Starr Apologia,"This book seemed to promise a good read as I perused the jacket. Experienced authors and an excellent recommendation from Richard Ben Cramer, author of the classic ""What It Takes."" My expectations were not met. This book is not ""balanced"" as Amazon.com's review suggests, nor does it provide a ""warts and all"" view of Ken Starr as the Amazon.com review claims. Indeed, the book is significantly biased and offers very little, if any, critical analysis of Ken Starr's motivations and character. The book was interesting and divulges some things I had not heard/read before. However, the book is yet another piece of anti-Clinton literature sold as if it were a balanced analytical review. Personally, I am very tired of such books. I believe Susan Schmidt and Michael Weisskopf should be ashamed of this piece of work. Chuck Montgomery Des Moines, Iowa"
3,I have a question:),I cannot find any information about the soundtrack of this movie. Does anyone know where i can find this music? I know that Dan navaro sings a song in it and i would like to find the soundtrack to purchase.
3,"An OK, entertaining film.","Its been several years since I last saw this film, but I remember it as being a nice bit of somewhat suspenseful evening entertainment. As an East coast native who moved out to the rural Southwest.....and then back East....and then back to the rural Southwest a second time, I could kind of relate to the movie's Courtney Cox coastal metropolitan character and the somewhat quirky small town characters as well.The song during the closing credits, ""What I Make Myself Believe"" fits the storyline nicely. For the kimsfish reviewer from Seattle, Washington (Jun/3/2001), there is no movie soundtrack per se that I know of. However the ""What I Make Myself Believe"" song by Eric Lowen/Dan Navarro can be found on the Lowen and Navarro album entitled ""Walking on a Wire""."
5,Fantastic music from 2 amazing masters!,"Although this CD had been previously given a low rating, I decided to go ahead and check it out simply based on the fact that it featured two great Ustads (masters) of music. What I found was an amazing exchange between two great minds that can only be described as heavenly music.This disc comes with two CDs, the first of which includes a spoken introduction by Ustad Vilayat Khan, and an alap section in which both musicians feature quite prominently.The second disc features a vocal bandish sung by Ustad Vilayat Khan, which then goes into a jugalbandhi that has become one of my favorite pieces of all Indian Classical Music.The entire disc features about 80 minutes worth of music, but is a great demonstration of powerful musical content by two masters of an old tradition.I would like to also contest the previous reviewer in that the difficulty or exoticism of the raga scale is not important, but rather the musical depth.A definite recommended buy."
4,Great Shaving Cream!,"All of Taylor's creams perform well (I've tried 9), so I like to choose them based on scent, and Taylors Rose is one my favorites.I like the smell of roses and this cream smells exactly like a rose."
4,Excellent Smooth Rosey Smelling Cream,"If you're a shaving cream person, then, you'll need this in your rotation. It smells like the package says: Roses. It's a very smooth, rich cream, as you would expect from an old English outfit as Taylor's of Old Bond Street. I only gave this four stars because I think theirTaylor of Old Bond Street Avocado Shaving Cream in a Bowl [Health and Beauty] is even better, more moisturizing, and a little more slippery.If you're really into rose, tryTruefitt & Hill Shave Cream Tub - Rose. It's more moisturizing, and produces a thicker richer fluffy lather like whipped cream when whipped up with a silvertip badger hair brush. I use a100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Faux Petrified Wood Handle & Free Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor.Back to this Rose cream - it's great for the price. If you're not willing to spend Trumpers or Truefitt & Hill money, than you still can get a great cream for the price. You won't go wrong either way.Happy Shaving!"
4,Worth The Price,"I found a black dot on the len, and the plastic feels loose. But it worth the price. Don't except too much."
3,"Works ok, not great",For the price its a decent set of binoculars. I use them to view the cruise ships as they leave the port.
4,They do the job,"I was looking for a pair of binoculars that had good distance, brightness and were compact enough to bring to the beach and on the boat. After comparing several I chose these due to good price for the features listed. Once I received them from Amazon I was impressed by the build quality and lens covers that did not fall off. At the beach these things performed well being able to see a clear bright image that made far away images look like they were really close by. The case that came with them has a shoulder strap and makes it easy to take these anywhere. Good value."
3,Great value but optics out of alignment,"I ordered two binoculars and the optics on one of them arrived out of alignment. Each eyepiece could focus really well but when you look through both eyes I got a double image. I will be returning the defective one for a replacement.Otherwise, the binocular that works is great. It is small when folded and powerful. Overall great value but Tasco may have some quality control issues."
1,DOUBLE VISION,"Unfortunately, just got this and although it looks like a solid binocular, there is something wrong with it as it gives double vision. Three of us have tried to adjust it but no one can get rid of the double vision. I always worry about getting things online because of this, and I'll have to send it back, costing me more for this than advertised. Major dissapointment."
5,These are great for the price.,"I have 3 sets of binocular's that I use on the boat. One day, I was trying to see an object 1/2 mile away onshore. I went through the other two pair not being able to tell what I was looking at. Then I pulled these out, the cheaper of the 3 pairs by far....and was able to see it. 10x50 is really the ideal power for a general use binocular, and these are very good, especially for the price."
3,"Simple for a 2 year old, 6 year old was disappointed","These binoculars are good for someone too little to really know what they do. They magnify yes, but there is no adjustment for the eyes. They are plastic but so far have withstanded several drops on the pavement. But overall no one wants to play with them since they are hard to use without being adjustable to head size. They are dollar store quality."
3,Hit and miss,"The first two binoculars were flawed. The first had a plastic burr in the lens which created a black line when looking through them. Sent them back for exchange. The next pair, the whole entire lens on the left was disconnected. Amazed me. Send those back and finally received a new pair. Very happy but lucky I guess."
4,Good love songs,"This CD has some pretty good love songs but several songs have exactly the same melody. The Che Guevara song (Hasta Siempre) is the best song on the album, very good guitar playing."
1,Mine is defective,"I generally agree with the other reviews, it takes some space around the hinge, it works best on light doors, it squeaks (WD-40 works on that, though), etc. The problem is that the lower jaw can slip around the shaft, releasing the tension. This is particularly true at higher tensions, where the spring distorts the angles somewhat. So it works for a few weeks and then it slips and you have to tension it again. A nuisance. I suspect that this will be a general problem. That lower jaw should be fused to the shaft."
3,Works best with no door resistance,"Length:: 0:59 MinsVery quick movie post-installation of the stanley hinge door closer. In my case, it does not work as there is simply too much pressure on the door from the carpet below, and the clothing hanging from the back. While I increased the spring tension, I was not able to really crank it sufficiently to overcome the reverse tension."
2,Squeaky Door Closer,"We installed three of these, bedroom, closet and bathroon door and they all squeak. Nothing like the closet door squeaking at 5AM while I'm trying to sleep. My husband even greased them up and they still squeak. The doors close but not enough pressure to make them latch."
1,Works but difficult to install.,"I have several of these pin door closers in my house. They work well but are difficult to install. Also, one broke within 2 years of installation."
1,Door almost-closer,"I used TWO of these on a normal weight door to my basement, and as many of the reviews say, it closed to the point where the door was near the latch, but didn't actually swing it that last crucial centimeter.I'm going to spend the twenty bucks and get a real door closer!"
2,Works When It Lasted,"Pros:1. Compact, inconspicuous2. No need to drill holes on door frame/door3. Easy to setupCons:1. It lost its functionality within 1 month.2. Its door-pressing plate slightly damaged my door frame.It'd be 4-star if it hadn't broke so fast."
1,Vermonter,Junk. Instructions very poor and could not install!!! Tried for an hour to install. There is no way to install on any of my doors!
5,It meets my needs....,My bathroom door has a tendency to swing open. Its really gross looking down the hallway with a toilet staring right in your face. I needed a hinge spring to give the door a gentle push to put it in the closed position without latching it. It was not easy to install. I chipped the door jambs during the install but I can easily touch that up. Sure beats having a bathroom door gaping wide open.
2,Didn't work out,Nice idea but the directions were awful. We got it installed finally but it would not close the door enough to latch. Our door is lightweight and swings easily. I could practically blow on it and it would close. So it didn't work out for us.
4,Wow! This Controversy Is Fascinating!,"I liked the book. It isn't one of the great works of literature. But it was fun and mindless. It's sort of like a dark Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel. ""Bridges of Madison County"" comes to mind - and that was panned by most critics too, but I loved the book. Men seem to hate this book but women like it. I don't think I've ever seen a man read Nora Roberts. Maybe it's a thing that has something to do with age and gender.I've never written a review before, but I just had to considering the extreme views of the other reviewers. I find the love/hate thing an indication that the book causes a great deal of feeling. Isn't that what reading something is suppose to do? I thought it was light reading, maybe it says more than I gave it credit for."
4,Loved It!,"I bought the book upon Dan Beck's recommendation in his ""Nob Hill Gazette"" review. While I agree with the other reviewer at amazon.com that the proof reading could be better - the story was great!I must admit I'm an Aaron Spelling junkie and I just loved ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty."" So a story about those types of people is something I find fun.I really found the book enjoyable. I'm surprised that the other review was so vitriolic - could it be he's a character? I noticed the ""San Francisco"" location. Anyway for us ""mature"" ladies - I recommend it highly."
1,"Not even ""good"" trash! This stinks on all levels.","Can I have my money back?Supposedly a roman a clef about events in ""San Francisco society,"" this amateur effort seriously disappoints on all levels. It makes for ponderous, annoying reading.Not only is the book poorly written, it is badly edited and sloppily produced. Typos abound, syntax and grammar are abominable, and the story makes no sense.The author and the misguided publisher owe all readers an apology, not to mention a refund."
3,"Only a couple a weeks away from expiration, Sept. 12.","Received them today. Taste and appearance are good. I only wonder how long ago were they made? I wouldn't have bought one single pack if I knew how old they were. Never mind a 12 pack! I thought I'd give online food buying a try, based on general positive experience with Amazon, however, I believe I will stick with my local stores for food shopping in the future. Hope this helps."
4,I AGREE!,"I agree with the above description - definitely forwarding thinking, while looking back with affection - old-skool meets nu-school, and the results - from CAN YOU DEAL WITH IT? to VACUUM JACKERS - are often stunning. Still, if you're looking for I:CUBE's past sound of deconstruction, percussive house, you may be a tad letdown. This album's vibe is much more KRUMPED."
3,Product Quality Evaluation,Some Bushnell products do not seem as solidly built as they were years before. Maybe this is because of the trend to use cheaper materials such as plastic.
5,Good value,"I wanted a decent cheap pair of binoculars to keep around the house and these fill the role very well. The 32mm objective lenses gives them an advantage over the more popular 25mm by letting in more light for a clearer picture without being much bigger. Although the 10x zoom is probably more practical for most people and the 16x would just be useless. Markus seems to have been expecting quite a deal from his and was apparently disappointed. If your picky then go get one of the ones that cost over $100. If you want something that's ""good enough"" and easy to carry around, then I'd recommend this."
1,Seeing Double,"I was hoping the Bushnell Powerview would be the affordable target shooting binocular I was looking for. While the image was relatively bright and sharp I saw two of everything. My first pair I received had dirt or cloudiness inside them that I couldn't clean and, notably, didn't seem correctly aligned as there seemed to be a slight double image. Figuring it was a bad unit, I asked Amazon for a replacement and received one the following week. Again, the image was relatively bright and sharp and, again, I saw two of everything. This is now going back for a refund. Not sure if my luck is that bad or if this series is that bad."
4,looking good,Bushnell Powerview 12x32 Compact Folding Roof Prism Binocular! they are doing fine for me. if you are over the top and think it should auto adjust for you buy a camera.THEY DO WORK VERY WELL.adjust the single lens on the right eye ( + or _ ) and then look Thur with both eyes and you will clear the subject up and view it clear.the power is 12x that is focal close. and the 32 is just right. I don't need to see a large parking lot as well.
3,Sent them back,"I was not thrilled with these binoculars. The main reason is that they do not have the option of sharpening one eyepiece separately and then sharpening the focus overall with the center focus ""wheel"". There is only type of focus (the center mechanism) so if you have one eye that is sharper than another you cannot fine tune these binocs. for the weaker eye. Otherwise, they seemed like a decent pair of binoculars for the price - just not for me."
5,The Best tennis movie ever.,"If you like tennis, this is going to be one of, if not your favorite movie."
3,Cast member,"Being interested in old movies and having performed some of the music for the film, I enjoyed watching Illusion. I missed it in theatres and was glad to find it available as a DVD."
5,Kirk Douglas Gives an Incredible Performance,"This movie was made on a shoe string budget by a novice director (who also acts the co-starring role). It is a haunting love story and a tale of dying with regret and opportunity for redemption. Kirk Douglas apparently was persuaded to act the role of the dying film director as a favor for the director, Michael A. Goorjian, who had struggled to raise the funds. However, the incredible acting of Kirk Douglas makes this a Holywood Hit (mispelling intended)! He is eloquent, humorous, and tragic, all-in-one. Oscar material. What an amazing performance, despite his physical challenges! I also loved the supporting cast...it was a roller coaster of tragedy, yearning, grief....and yes, a classical happy ending (unusual nowadays)."
2,Reads like 'Caversham Heights' brought to life,"Stop - put that mouse down now. Walk slowly away from the keyboard. If you enjoy contemporary 'British detective' stories don't waste your time on this book. The characters are cardboard, the dialog(ue) stilted and unbelievable - the plot so tedious that your eyes glaze over. I suggest you head over to one of the 'Bill Slider' tales to see how this type of modern detective story should be written.It is not the waste of money I object to, so much as the hassle of getting the dings out of the wall caused by my throwing this book across the room.[If you have read Jasper fforde then the title 'Caversham Heights' says it all - if you haven't, then a quick 'search' will explain all.]"
5,A slice of what the Draft Resistance movement was about,"A very informative book on a era in which either you weren't alive at the time, too young, or couldn't believe that you went through all of what happened during the 1960's to early 1970's."
3,"Good, but there is better","While good, PC Study has one near fatal flaw -- it's not Logos compatible. I've used it for four years, but recently upgraded to Logos Bible Reference. I'm I ever glad I did. All the advantages of PC Study, and a whole lot more."
3,short and dense,Weighing in at less than three hundred pages on a history as convoluted and mysterious to Americans as that of Africa it still manages to convey at massive amounts of information. This is also it's main weakness dumping extras like style and readability it gets incredibly frustrating at times. The subject is fascinating though. The sections on the approaches taken by the various holding countries to release their holdings and transfer rule are fascinating.
3,For just those throw in jobs.,"Not for the professional jobs for sure, but for simple around the house things or for when you don't want to put something expensive in because it is a ""hazardous"" location these are great. After being crimped the tabs lay almost completely flat and will not ""click"" into place to keep the cable in it's place. I just pull it up carefully with my utility knife and everything seems fine, they do however flatten again with repeated use so it is best to use in a more permanent locations"
5,Works for me.,"This is the first time that I had to use this these RJ-45 plugs. My grandmother moved in to a new house with cat-5 cable going through most of the rooms. She had asked me to removed the cables since she did not need them. I had to cut the wires and figure that I could use them for myself. I bought these RJ-45 connectors to fix the wires and they worked perfectly. It is cheaper to buy the plugs and wires and put it together yourself, rather than to buy the complete wires at a store.WARNING: In order to be able to fix wires using this connector, you will need an RJ-45 wire crimper. It is a tool that crimps the connector to the wire."
1,Garbage!!!,"I bought these and thought, what could go wrong? Well for the simple job they are intended, they fail miserably. I tried a few and all of them refused to stay secured in the ethernet port. Small amount of money but a waste none the less."
3,Major Disappointment,"I can't tell you how excited I was when I heard the first AC/DC-like chords early in the album... Some good old fashioned bawdy rock with phat chords, cool harmonies and a rhythm section pulling it all along. What we get is the wimpiest record ever made by a band that knows better. Given the dearth of decent music, Sloan gives us their impression of a Peaches & Herb record."
4,Bring it on: more Sloan please,There certainly are different styles on this album and that is true. The songs speak of self-assurance in contrast to Flannelmouth who speak of self-defeat in a world of love. The melodies on this album are catchy even if it isn't a consist style. I don't care. I like variety and this band never misses a beat. Bring it on: more Sloan please.
2,Major letdown,"I've been a fan of Sloan since ""Smeared,"" and have always looked forward to the next album. Some folks maligned ""Between the Bridges,"" but I thought it was one of their best efforts, especially Jay Ferguson's stuff. But ""Pretty Together"" just doesn't do it for me. It sounds like an empty, rote exercise. The melodies are flat, the performances perfunctory, the spirit lacking. Worst of all, the distinctive songwriting personalities of all four Sloaners have been homogenized into one big rock sound that's just not very distinctive. I thought the New Pornographers' last album is more Sloan than the new Sloan. And a whole lot better. I hope that ""Pretty Together"" is just a career hiccup and that Sloan will bounce back. This album is sort of like being let down by formerly dependable friends."
5,"Concise, easy to use reference","This is not my only Linux reference, but it's the one I'm finding it easy to use quickly when all I need is some specific piece of information to get something done.Unlike many of the larger 'bible'-type books, this one is small and easy to use and keep handy. I have some of the larger books as well, but I think this one is more useful if I need to look something up quick or if I need to carry a book with me back to the computer lab.In short -- this is a great, concise Red Hat reference. I'd recommend it as a compliment to having some of the larger, more in-depth books."
1,Disappointed,"I find this book disappointing. Firstly, one fourth of the book is taken up by the author's travel accounts. It's a different story when an author gives some background to each recipe. But it is not the case here and I find the result of those two books rolled into one very awkward. Second, and more annoyingly, many recipes rely on meat substitutes. I have always found it sad and the sign of a certain lack of imagination when vegetarian cooking tries to mimick meat-based dishes. It is particularly regrettable in a book on Turkish cooking which has a rich tradition of NATURALLY vegetarian dishes. Which is why I ordered the book in the first place !"
3,Good cookbook but for a real vegeterian,"This cook book includes many good recipes, however in most recipes meat/chicken/fish originally required and the suggested replacement is flawared soy based meat substance such as tofu, etc. That is OK if you are not a vegetarian but trying to cut meat, but if you really are a vegetarian, smell of those items are not desired. For this matter the recipes are not really vegetarian ones, at least not for me. I still praise the book as successful one because it includes many exceptionally good options. I wished it had more stew recipes though."
1,web of the spider-greeting card,"extremely poor picture quality...whoever took advantage of using the beautiful picture with ""MERRY CHRISTMAS"" should be prosecuted!!!!!! a total ripoff ."
