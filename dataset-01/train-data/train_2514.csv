3,It's alright...,"This album is alright... to me it feels like it makes a good dance party mix. Unlike ISOS 4 or 7, which, to me, are albums that feel like that fit any activity you are doing no matter what. There are a a lot of vocals, a lot of upbeat songs... just a very steer turn from the direction I personally enjoy from the ISOS series."
1,I was left In Search of Substance.,"Having listened to many of Tiesto's other previous and succeeding productions, this one truly leaves a lot to be desired. To start, disc 1, the worst of the two, it is mostly composed of transcendental vocals over very lame tracks, there is truly little energy or emotional value here that merits any mention. It is more, this is so to such a degree that listening to such mind numbing and bleak monotony in its entirety truly becomes an annoying test of endurance. Then comes disc 2, in it one starts to hear tracks with a little more melody and life, but still, it is all very sub-par stuff. Indeed, it is not new to see people who just because something simply has the name of a known artist value it beyond its true value. This is one of those cases and I am simple not one of those people."
3,"""In Search Of Sunrise 5"" was not the best of Tiesto....","When I played this CD in my car I was expecting a great job from Tiesto. But If you guys like all kind of trance, house, techno and dance music we're all know that this was not the best job from tiesto. Me and my friend are very dissappointed with this new album... It looks like he did not put these tracks on both cds."
5,keeps me home,"This cd set of Tiesto's is really great i live in Los Angeles and driving at 80 on L.A.'s most known freeway you can understand that no matter during the day or at night its a really good energetic album my favorite is ""moonlight party"" because that brings the suspense of speed during the day or night and those loud hits are fantastic you have to pick up a copy"
5,The best CD I have ever purchased!,Tiesto is an amazing DJ and this CD proves it to the fullest degree. Every track keeps you wanting more. I highly suggest this CD to anyone who likes feel-good music :)
1,yawn...,"This CD lasted about 3 days in my car before I shelved it to never be listened to again. I just could not grow into it. I have done better mixing myself, its so sub par from what we are used to with Tiesto. I hope he never does something this boring again. Whatever happened to the days of Magik Vol 6? Its what you get here, boring, uncreative mixing. The fan boys will love it of course because it has the Tiesto logo. If you want a good trance CD, I suggest something else. This is an awful CD."
1,My ears are mad at me,"I have to agree with many of you - this is atrocious. The first CD starts out with a great mood setter, but winds up being the musical equivalent of a last call, lights go on - ugly pill shocker. The track selection is very questionable and the mixing is no better. Tijs just has not produced anything remotely reaching his Nayana masterpiece since, Nayana. There are some good pieces throughout the 2 discs, but I recommend spending your money on something else."
3,"Good, not great...","My opinion...Some nice tracks in cd 1, mostly vocals, You think the 2nd disc its gonna be even better, but not quite so, 2nd disc dissapointed me, just like ISOS 4. Where is the passion, Tiesto?"
1,TIESTO GIVES US ONE MORE REASON TO HATE HIM!,"what else is there to say, except stay away- the almighty god of the sound of torment makes us want to rage some more. Please I beg you tiesto, go away and leave us all alone."
5,MC,All of In Search of Sunrise series just amazing... (I just bought all of them). This is how trance music should sound... and these CD's must have for those who really appreciates this genre of music. I think trough these CD's you can track the progression of trance music... starting from ISOS 1 in 1999 to ISOS 5 in 2006. See the difference? :-)
1,What is this?,"This is practically the worst Tiesto (and Trance CD) I've ever witnessed. While the sounds are complex and consistant with today's ""new sound"" it lacks so much melody and drama. To be honest, it really feels monomelodic. Infact, it isnt trance at all! It's progressive. It is a poor follow up to ISOS4 (Which is truley what Trance is about, in my opinion). However I will admit, CD2 is more of a tiesto style.So if you like progressive music, buy this. If you want some true Trance get Armin Van Buuren's State of Trance 2006. or Ferry Corsten's Creamfields."
1,"Skims over topics , Code for all chapters not available","Well, the book tries to cover JAI, JMF and J3D all in one book.And does not do too good a job on either (JAI and J3D). I have not tried the JMF chapters. Also my major peeve with the book is that the code for J3D is not available online. I think this was just rushed out of the door."
2,example code does not work,I bought this book because of the extensive coverage. I was very disappointed with example code. They were incomplete and inaccurate with many typos. I don't understand this because the book also included output from programs that obviously worked. I would not by this had i know about this.
5,Amazing!,"Everyone should own a copy of this CD -- it has been a wonderful addition to my collection. I enjoy listening to it in the mornings before a busy day at work, on the way home in the car, while I'm cleaning and while I'm making dinner. It's a definite must for your home's collection."
1,Otra basura sin atenuantes...,"...de este 'especie' de artista, que lo único que hace es ganar plata a costa de gente que no quiere desarrollar un buen gusto por la música."
1,Infamia publica,"Este disco es un resumen de lo que mejor sabe hacer Arjona: Tratar de tomar pose. Lo malo es que no la toma bien, no se le ve antural si uno se fija bien, pero de lejos y por encimita da el gatazo. En este concierto toma pose de artista consagrado, de esos clasicos que tiene tantas conciones en su repertorio que tiene que cantar tres en una cancion para poder cantar las mas posibles, sin desepcionar a la mayoria. Tambien tira frases poeticas con pensamientos profundos que son refritos de frases de otros personas originales que lo dijeron en privado sin buscar que las mujeres enloquecieran al oirlo. Arjona no termina de definir su personalidad y termina siendo un Frankenstein muy bien vestido y que solo quien seconoce los brazos y piernas de sus dueños origiales se puede dar cuenta."
4,Nicely done performance,"He pulls off a good show with a deck of computers and machines.The show is well shot, and it sounds good.Sure, maybe some more projection screen(s), lights, monkeys, special effects, etc could be included. I still enjoyed it. But what I would like to see is a really great percussionist on stage. Maybe two. That could be powerful."
3,Thrash on,"The thrasher is what it is, a cheap piece of nylon that eats though weeds and edges lawns. It's better than most nylon alternatives, but requires changing. I notice that the lower the rpms, the longer the thrasher lasts. Not sure why so many folks trash the thrash. It's not a steel cable that promises to go through everything that gets in its way, including a shoe or leg..... I have been using this product for about three years. The nylon you get with replacement strings is the same as what came with the original kit, no difference. It's a safe buy, but don't plan on cutting down trees with it."
1,These suck,"I bought the weed thrasher head with hopes of convenience. This was not the case. These refills broke continuously after a couple minutes use on plain grass (no hard edges such as rocks or cement). I read others reviews on them who suggessted boiling to increase elasticity, which I did, with absolutely no change in performance....waste of time and money."
1,not worth $1.00,i had weed thrashers about 9 yrs. ago that worked well; however the new batches that i bought last yr. will not last. they break apart on thick grass or anything tough. i tried boiling in a huge pot of water for about 20 minutes and they still broke apart within 1 minute of use. i don't know what they did to change the plastic in the refills but i wish they would go back to what they were doing before 9 yrs. ago when they actually worked. i guess this is why wal-mart quit carrying their product and maybe vise-versa why there product quit being dependable.
1,very poor product,"this is the worst product i have ever seen, was a good thing i ordered several packs, because it took a whole pack of 20 weed thrashers just to weed eat around my house one time, they all break off in half after running the weed eater for about 90 seconds, so you are constantly having to stop and replace them. The material these things are made of is very cheap and they are also very hard to get on. Will never buy again."
2,Pricey but Cheap; Durability needs work,"These use to be a little more durable in the past than today's batch I used. I cut tall grass and in about 3-5 feet I need a new set. Love the design, hate the product presently. Tall grass shred these blades in seconds forcing me to replace the tips. Went through a whole pack with no obstacles in one afternoon, where it might have been 4-6 in the past. Hope they improve soon or I will be going back to fishing wire."
5,Weed Thrasher cutters Do the Job!,"I have had these cutters for quite awhile. I reordered because I used up the last order. This product does a great job on all types of grasses and weeds. The only thing that I find doesn't work with these thrashers is stone walls! Our property is completely outlined with stone terracing. So I tend to break them fairly regularly. This said, I haven't had anything that works as well as these cutters. The last order from Amazon was more flexible than some of the previous cutters, which I got from a vendor that specializes in lawn and garden equipment. This makes them more forgiving around hard surfaces. Recently I had to cut a pathway through some hay. I did all the cutting without changing the cutters once. I had to stop because my weedeater over heated, but the cutters lasted over two hours without breaking. I'll be back for more when these wear down! Great product!"
4,Good CD for a musical-select audience,"As others note below, one really needs to have a somewhat good familiarity with musicals to really ""get"" this show--although I thought I did, the recording truly tests me. And I enjoy it for that. Apart from that, and although I really do enjoy the recording and am glad I purchased it, I didn't find the music or the performances as ""musical"" as I would have liked, and I didn't get as much of a ""wow"" factor as I thought I would. (Just my personal opinion, folks!) But I still will play the CD again to test myself and to enjoy the cleverness of the concept and execution."
5,Wonderful,"I saw this show at the York Theatre in December and fell in love with it. My best friend was an assitant for the show and told me I needed to see it.I just loved it. I know my musical theatre, there were only a few jokes I missed when I saw it. Joanne Bogart and Eric Rockwell did an amazing job with lyrics, book, and even some of the songs are quite beautiful.It's an ingenious idea that was wonderfully performed. I'm a Sondheim fan, so A Little Complex is my favorite segment, but the Andrew Lloyd Webber skit is hysterical too.""It's Juny with a J, not Guny with a G..."""
5,Musical Hilarity,"What a sophisticated, hilarious romp through the ""history"" of musicals!Loved it as much as the first time I saw it in St. Louis"
5,Hillarious fluff :D,"I'm not sure if it is necessary to know ever musical there is by heart to enjoy this, but it probably helps a little.This show consist of one very basic plot line consisting of a young ingenue owing rent to the villain, whereupon the hero offers a solution. It is retold five times, each in the style of some of the most prominent creative teams of musical theatre.A large part of the fun is allusions to the music, lyrics and overall style of said creative teams. Yet it is also possible to enjoy the show as pure parody of styles most people are at least a little familiar with.Buy this regardless of which musical style you prefer, or which composer you are familiar with. You're guaranteed a heckuvalot of fun."
2,Not for reenactor,This belt would be good for a child toy belt or costume. Webbing was not very heavy and the clasp was made of a light metal. Would not hold up for a reenactor gear or pat even the ten foot rule. Size was very small.
4,What You Pay For,"The belt is a khaki pistol military belt that many have claimed to be made poorly however by my experience the item is rather really sturdy the only part that may cause frustration is where it is supposed to buckle. its made from what i can tell is a canvas and is pretty sturdy so far ive carried my pistol, canteen and multiple ammo pouches. overall i am gratefully satisfied"
3,"Better than the fake stuff, but the organic version is way better","These are a million times better for kids than Fruit Roll-ups, of course, but nobody should be eating Fruit Roll-ups. Real fruit is much better for kids and much cheaper.We get these as treats for our kids and they do love them, but they are SMALL and the kids always want a dozen more.Also, strawberries are some of the most heavily doused fruits in terms of pesticides, so I always pay the little extra to get Stretch Island's organic fruit leather instead. I'm disappointed Amazon doesn't carry those."
2,Yuck. Seriously. YUCK!,"Ugh! I really wanted to like these as I love Fruit Roll-Ups, yet wanted something healthy. Well, unfortunately ity wasn't meant to be; these straps are just awful, they have such a bizarre off-putting texture that it makes it possible to enjoy the taste. (Not that the taste is great either.) The name ""Leather"" is so apropos; this snack is seriously like chewing a belt, although I'm sure some belts have a better taste than these ""fruit"" bars."
3,Not what I wanted,I guess I didn't read the reviews closely enough before purchasing this item. The consistency is similar to strips purchased at Target which I didn't really care much for. My toddler cousin loved these though so they can't be that bad...I think I just wanted a fruit roll- up.
2,Not at all fresh,normally these are amazing but these were very dry and old. They were brown instead of pink and tough and hard to eat i would not buy again.
3,Hard to open & really sticky,"I purchased these as an alternative to the Gerber fruit strips for my toddler. The kid won't touch most fruit with a ten foot pole, but these he will eat, though not as easily as he eats the Gerber ones.While I appreciate that he does eat these strips, the individual plastic packages are difficult to get open. If you open them slightly wrong (which happens about 50% of the time), they require scissors to get the plastic the rest of the way off. These fruit leathers are also extremely sticky, which makes them less than ideal for a snack on the go.Overall, they are an acceptable alternative to the Gerber fruit strips but certainly not ideal."
1,Bad Batch?,"I had high hopes for these fruit leathers as my daughter loves them. When we received them in the mail and I opened the box they were all a very brown color, they look nothing like the red color in the picture shown. Before giving my daughter one I wanted to try it myself to make sure they were ok. I took one bite and spit it out. It was very dry and did not taste like fruit at all. It was awful. From all of the outstanding reviews I am hoping we just got a bad batch but am not going to order another batch to find out. I went back to Target and got the Archer Farms fruit strips."
1,We got a hard batch- will not try them again,"I guess we got a stale batch- the product was still supposed to be good, according to the ""sell by"" date. This was the worst dried fruit product I have ever had. It was very tough- like real leather, instead of fruit leather. We like the Cliffs fruit ropes, and the Target organic fruit leather (always soft and delicious), and I will never take a chance on this brand again."
2,Not that great,I am a die hard Fruit Roll-up fan. So I decided to give these a try since they are all natural. I did NOT like the flavor or texture of this product. It was dry and does not have much flavor. Do not recommend. I am going back to Fruit Roll-ups permanently.
4,Strawberry Stretch Island Fruit Leather,"My daughters really love the taste of this product and we usually run out before the next shipment comes. Plus my wife and I are very happy that it has no artificial flavors, preservatives, or colors."
1,it was BROWN,Looked disgusting and tasted disgusting too. I am guessing that this product had been left exposed to heat or something- I am discarding this
2,Not very flavorful and very tough.,"They were not very flavorful and very tough. Gave it away. The grape ones were better, which is why I bought these. Unfortunately I was disappointed."
4,Excellent! Fruit roll-ups for adults,"These are excellent tasting fruit strips. I have eaten all the different flavors and while they are all good, the strawberry is by far the best. Regardless of which flavor you buy, these are primarily made of apples and the apple taste is recognizable in each flavor. They are only 70 calories and do fairly well at filling me up when I need a snack. The box that the fruit strips come in is convenient for setting on the counter for easy ""grab n' go"". The only negative to these is they are very sticky on one side (which is odd), and you need to watch how you unwrap and eat them or you end up with sticky fingers. Therefore, due to the sticky fingers, I have to take away a star."
4,Great option for a fruit roll up,"If you are looking for a yummy chewy treat I would suggest these summer strawberry treats. Although these are not as sweet as ""fruit roll ups"" these are much more healthy as its pretty much all fruit. With no artificial flavors or sugars these make a great treat for just about everyone. If you are trying to feed them to a child who enjoys fruit roll ups it may be a little tricky, however as an adult it was easy to make the switch."
4,Tasty,"My wife loves these things. All fruit snacks of any type. These happen to be pretty great quality ones. Thick, chewy and tasty."
4,tastey,"My teenage kids like these more than I do. I find them a little boring for some reason, but they love them."
2,Aluminum credit card case,"The case is ok, but a little larger than I thought. Worse, it comes right out of your pocket very easily. So for men, they may want to rethink this idea.I had mine in my back pocket and nearly lost everything when it fell out at a restaurant. Luckily, the management found it and held on to it until I could get back. Since then, I went back to what I was using in the first place. Ok in a purse,but not in your back pocket."
1,Falls apart,"At first I liked it even though it was often hard to hold. However, the wallet is fragile and has luck would have it, I dropped it and it fell apart. It didn't completely separate but all the contents spilled all over the asphalt and the wallet would not clasp shut. Worthless!!!"
2,It doesn't look like the picture,"I ordered 2, took longer than expected. It doesn't look like the picture. The inside of mine look like a cheap plastic. The outside is not silver its gold."
3,"Great concept, poor design.","At first this wallet worked exactly the way my boyfriend wanted it to, which is why I bought it for him; twice. Unfortunately it broke both times after less than a year of use. The first time, the closing mechanism broke. The second time, the whole thing split apart."
1,"Clip came off the first day, bulky, cheap","Looks good on the site, but was cheap looking item upon arrival. First day I used it the plastic latch came off. Didn't break, just came apart.Too bulky and looks like cheap plastic. This one is a waste of your $$.I'd give it a ZERO stars, but the system needs at least 1 star."
1,Sent different item than pictured- buyer beware,"I expected to get the item pictured, and instead got this item: http://www.amazon.com/Name-Card-Case-Assorted-4-25/dp/B000X2IF20/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s;=office-products&qid;=1252007212&sr;=8-4which is cheap, wafer thin aluminum and not at all what I ordered, plus was 1/4 the cost. Amazon said they will refund upon return, but what a huge hassle. Skip this item as well as this seller."
2,Striped Alum Card Case Not Broken,"I received 3 of these Aluminum Card Cases the 3rd one arrived not broken. The closure seems very fragil. Cool little case. I don't know how long it will last. It cost 14.95, returning 2 times cost a little money. My husband did it. I didn't want to put out any more money. Too bad Amazon got associated with this product. Its good as long as it doesn't break."
4,This works for me!,"I purchased this knowing by the price that it wasn't top-of-the-line. I am pleased with the service I have gotten so far - about 2 months. It does exactly what the seller promised, and I am happy with it."
1,The Wrong Frigg,"This is not the excellent Finnish Group of the same name which produced the album ""Oasis"" or the self-titled album in 2004, both on Northside Records.I don't wish to say anything bad about this Knitting Factory Records-produced album. Just suffice it to say that, for me, it took all of 30 minutes to go from mailbox to stereo to trash can."
3,Not the Young Indy I remember,"I was a big fan of the TV show when it was on: I taped the show and watched them several times. The problem here is the ""curse"" and the supernatural/ghost sequence: the Norman cross as a ruby mounted sword handle isno problem, but Indiana Jones is a scientist. All the curses in the past have been based on real world scientific results.Here we have young Indiana Jones doing Latin incantations toinfluence a cursed sword that has been stolenfrom the Union Organizer Roberto Normanni who is sinking fast from the curse.Professor Jones is an expert on Norman history in thisbook and we learn about suffragettes, but not the wobblies( Industrial Workers of the World ) which was the internationalunionism organization of that time period.Except for the curse stuff, the book is OK."
2,Get the kind without wings,"I love this brand in the long box or plastic container but these should be titled panty liners! My period flows heavy irregularly and these work if you always have an extra on you but as soon as it looks like you have fully ""stained"" the pad you really need to change this one or else it is definitely going to overlow if you get in the middle of a heavy spot!I might keep buying these for the last day of my period but otherwise I think these should at least be labeled ""light"" and not regular. I changed my pad three times today and my evening pad is unfortunately failing me. I am also thin and have never used a size beyond ""regular"" in any brand that will last me a 8-12 hours if I need it to (I used to work long shifts) so this really only holds a tiny amount."
1,what a joke,the alarms are poorly made and did not work i thought it may have been a faulty set bought in another store still did not work. I dont recommend these
1,What East Hartford Said,"What East Hartford said. I had/have the exact same problem. Loss of connection for approximately 10-20 seconds every minute or two. Not a real problem if you're a casual surfer. Real problem if you require a constant/reliable connection.I was set at channel 6, switched to channel 1 (planning to run through them all 1 by 1). Channel 1 appears to be working well. I'll know better in a few days. If not, I'll start working through them all. Like E.H., I show no other networks, but something is causing interference.If you have this problem, start changing up your channels.As for setup and operation (aside from the above glitch) it was amazing. Very, very, very easy. I believe I was up and running in 15 minutes with my desktop, laptop and WPA encryption.Edit 01/07/04: Nevermind. Been through all the channels and still having the same problem. Going to scrap this unit. Too bad too, because otherwise it was near perfect."
2,Lose Connection,"This thing is driving me crazy. I can't maintain an internet connection once the base station is connected. Apparently this is a problem for PPPOE connnections. It doesn't make sense. I am going to try to find an upgrade on the net, but it is looking like I am going to return it. The only positve thing is that it looks nice and can connect at 54MBs."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I also purchased this based on the excellent customer support references. Those references must have been given before Microsoft sent their tech support overseas. On my first call I talked to two support people. They couldn't understand me and I couldn't understand them enough to tell what they wanted me to do. The second one kept saying ""This is not a problem."" It is. I'm sending it back."
5,Very good product,I purchased this kit recently and installed at home. I have Deasktop with xp pro and laptop with xp home. I just followed setup instructions and did not have any problem during installation. Everything works fine.
5,"A serious-minded, well-reasoned discourse","Prophetic & Public: The Social Witness Of U.S. Catholicism by Kristin E. Heyer (Assistant Professor of Christian ethics in the Department Theological Studies as Loyola Marymount University) seeks to answer the question ""What is the appropriate relationship between religious beliefs and public life?"", particularly with regard to the United States, founded on a commitment to religious tolerance. Looking to the example of the Catholic Church and prominent Catholics Michael Baxter and Bryan Hehir, as well as U.S. Catholic advocacy groups The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, NETWORK, and Pax Christi USA, Heyer applies the discourse of public theology to evaluate what constitutes appropriate religio-political engagement. Through her search for norms in case studies, she seeks an equitable balance between Catholic theological belief and the need for public action upon urgent theological issues. A serious-minded, well-reasoned discourse."
2,not extreMetal,"I agree this is more prog than black. For me, the clean vocals are horrible, and the extreme screeches don't fit the often symphonic tunes. I like plenty of (symphonic) black metal, doom metal, and goth metal, but this would be better as an instrumental album for me. Lyrics range along the winter metal border. Very mellow, with nothing extreme but the part-time black metal vocals."
3,Revelation not unveiled,"I do not agree at all with Gurney's interpretations of Revelation, his explanation of the Beast etc. The only part of the book that seemed to ring true to me are his timelines that give dates for Judgment Day and the coming tribulations. Also, the book is very small for the price."
1,Damo Mackerel from Waterford (Go on the Deises!),"Another waste of paper. If you want a laugh go ahead and purchase this book because not only does it show itself up now that it's predictions dates are passed but it also shows up books in this type of genre, notably the bible code. The 'predictions' made in this book have come and gone. For instance, the author claimed that the Russian space station would crash into the earth with an explosion on such a scale the human race and the ecosystem would be decimated, we are also told of nuclear attacks, civil unrest world wide and .... well you know what I mean. The thing is, all these doom and gloom forecast were supposedly meant to happen on or around the year 2000 and I sorry for stating the obvious put have they? What I also find amazing is that people are posting 5 star reviews 2 years after this authors claims that events will take a turn for athe worst! Are these people serious?"
3,Disappointing,"At only 124 pages,I didn't feel that Mr. Gurney covered the subject nearly as well as I had expected. Much of what he presents is interesting and enlightening, but I thought he didn't make a very good case and some of his conclusions seem pretty contrived. The book gets tedious at times, and overall I was disappointed."
5,You must read this book.,"When I first picked up the book I was sceptical about prophecy, but Gurney has changed my mind. This book mirrors exectly what is happening in the world today and is a frightening indictment of the world we live in. There is a war coming and Judgement Day is not far off. Prepare yourself now and read this book. It will change the way you think about the future. A very worthwhile read, but scary."
3,not your basic ballet!,I took Ballet when I was a child and thought this would be a great way to get back into it! I recommend this for experienced ballerinas its an intermediate video.
4,Worth the money,"Fantastic class. I love that he leads the video just like he would a class (instruction so you can mark it, and does both sides) albeit with probably a little less critiquing of the dancer. His barre is a great workout, though some of the center pushes me beyond my capabilities, a good center workout will do that. The sound quality is not good, but if you are a dancer who wants a real isntructor you won't care. I bought the accompanying CD and I love using to modify the workouts. I definitely recommend it."
5,A Quality Gift,My daughter is a professional artist. I sent this paint as a gift without knowledge of paints. She was very happy and thankful for my choice. My daughter is very picky where her art is concerned and this was a definite winner.
5,EASY DATA ENTRY FOR YOUR LAPTOP,"This device was a Godsend. I don't do that much data entry, but this keypad greatly increased my productivity when working with spreadsheets and data bases on my laptop.It worked perfectly with my Dell laptop runing Windows 2000 as soon as I plugged it in. I didn't need to install any drivers or other software."
3,Not exactly install friendly.,"I have Toshiba laptop with Vista. Originally when I plugged this in and waited for the drivers to install it didn't work. I was little miffed, and visited the companies website with little help (very lacking in information). I unplugged it and plugged it in again. It installed a second time, and THEN it worked. Functions fine after that, but I almost threw it away thinking it would not work."
1,GARBAGE - DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC,This thing is garbage. It says it's compatible with OSX. It is not. If you plug it in your computer will not recognize it and will ask you to hit the key to the right of the shift key. There is no shift key. Don't buy this if you own a mac.
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH VISTA NO SUPPORT,This worked fine with my laptop which was run with XP. It however does not work with VISTA and I can't find any support online.
3,Same as before,Another Great Kid Rock Album but for vinyl listeners too bright not enough low end.I have two sub woofers that never see any use with your records.
3,Disappointing,"This book caught my eye with the promise of a murder mystery and a romance story in one book. However, i was very disappointed . One major drawback in ""Nothing to Lose"" was there was not alot of action, in fact, the same thing happens over and over again .The first 200 pages basically show the distress, and pain of the main character, Micheal,over his abusive stepfather, and how he deals with this situation.Finally the plot gets interesting I start thinking ok maybe this will all work out HowEvER it doesn't. The mystery is solved, but then when he finds the girl he fell in love with and trys to go visit her, they just don't love each other. THE END.Wow! If you are looking for a realistic book that deals with abuse, this is your book. However, if you are looking for a good romance story and a nice mystery that is interesting this is not the book for you."
1,!!! URGHHH !!!,"This book was BORING!!! I liked Flinn's other books well enough, but this was just stupid right from the beginning. After about two chapters I was able to predict what the 'surprise' was at the end: and I found that I was 100% correct. Alex Flinn was trying to make the end of the book interesting and melodramatic just did not work. A very, very, predictable novel, if you even could call it a novel. I suppose that the carnival part was okay, but the flimsy fairy-tale romance thing was just plain dumb. I would hope that this was just a bad phase of book writing, because I personally beleive that Flinn is capable of much, much, better literature."
3,Interesting but Predictable,"I am a teen girl who read this book because I liked Ms. Flinn's other books. I don't think this one is as good because it is very predictable. Only a few chapters into the book I already figured out what Michael did, and I was wondering if Ms. Flinn wanted me to figure it out that way and then she would surprise me at the end of the mystery. But there was no surprise at all. I liked all the stuff about the life in the carnaval, but I didn't actually understand why Michael's mom married the bad guy in the first place and then stayed with him for two years because he was so bad. Was it just because he was rich?"
4,Well-crafted and thought out.,"""Nothing to Lose"" tackles the difficult topic of domestic abuse: it's possible causes, those involved, and residual effects. There are no black and white answers here which makes the plot and characters very believable. A must-read, especially for those young people who think violence in a relationship is ""the way it is"" or a sign of love."
1,To thin,"The amount of memory foam in this item is neglible...I think there is about a half inch thickness.In my experience it was not enough to stave off the aches I get on a 13 hour car trip.Save your cash and, instead, purchase a bottle of Alieve pain killer for your long trip."
2,Only sew-sew,"Listening to the Magnetic Fields track made me think that this Cd would be a gem, but it's just not so. There are only two or three songs on it that aren't painful to listen to. The good ones (If I Were a Rich Man, Sunrise Sunset and arguably Miracle of Miracles) are quite good, but in some cases, Matchmaker for example, it seems the bands were trying to ruin the songs. This Cd will please a niché audience, but is not for everyone. The potential is there for something great, but Knitting just falls short."
3,Bryce loves the Residents,"The Residents continue to prove their absurdist genius. When you listen to the song, always remember: these guys are in tuxedos and top hats with a giant eyeball inbetween. Does it get any better than that?No!"
3,It's OK for the price,"First of all, this is a steal for the price. Albeit, I only count one good piece of leather in the entire bundle, and that's the piece they used to staple the bundle together. The other pieces were of useful size, but the leather itself was white-dyed or synthetic, and not very strong at all. It's almost like tooling-grade leather, but the edges were flaky and it came with stamps of some odd blemish every 6 inches or so, making it not very good cosmetic leather (flakiness + impressions every 6 inches). Some unevenly-cut leather lace was included of the same white material, so it wasn't that useful due to its thick bulkiness coupled with its lack of strength.All in all, it's almost not worth the shipping but I can't complain now that it's already here and I have some extra bulk in my scrap pile."
3,good design but quality is slipping,"This is the 6th pair of Clarks that I've bought so far. It is well made and designed to fit to size. However, since the leather is quite stiff making it not very comfortable to wear. My other Clarks had soft leather so they are flexible and comfortable for walking. I wish Clarks would not compromise the quality by using such stiff leather."
2,Enjoyable Game Ruined by Bad Design,"It's unfortunate, but Hamtaro: Ham-Ham Games is game that could have been great, but is practically unplayable due to poor design. The gameplay is among the best in Track and Field - styled games, and thankfully with no button bashing. However, it takes fully five minutes of slow walk-and-talk and unskippable cutscenes to start a session, the player is given little to no ability to control game saves and options, and the character is nearly as large as the screen. I'd say pass this one by."
5,What an awesome.......... TOYYY!!!,"This game is the best! You should really buy it. The ages should be 5 and up. The best thing about this fabulous game , is that the screen and color is alot better than the other Hamtaro games. The main point of this game is to verse other teams in sports, like the Olympics. If you win the most gold medals, you win the tournament. BUY THIS GAME, IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
5,A hunting oddysey,This is a great account of the authors pursuit and realization of his hunting dreams - dreams that not many of us have the opportunity or ability to bring to fruition. Mr. Jones writing never fails to hold your interest and I would highly recommend his book to all. Superior stories by a superior person.Tom Warner
2,OK,"An ok book, but long at the tooth. Get tired of the guy blowing his own horn. And, what does it prove other than it takes money to do something like this."
5,Elektronic assault,"French industrialists TAMTRUM unleash their debut album for Belgian Electro Label Alfa Matrix - a caustic, provocative and perverted assault of sonic manipulation and mutilation. ''Elektronic Blakc Mess'' takes power industrial electro delivered with a dark goth/metal look and sounds that veer between harsh electro sequences, distorted vocals and blistering drum patterns comparable to bands like HOCICO, with a rather MANSON(esque) attitude. Their music and lyrics (in French & English) are morbid, disturbing, nasty, sick, noisy and above all hyper-danceable. A new hi-energy and merciless aggressive assault for all fans of hardcore Electro."
1,Adware,"This version of Quicken seems to me to be Adware. On just about every screen, the program presents the user with advertising for additional services or software upgrades that Intuit wants to sell you. There is no way to remove the advertising from the view."
1,Intuit pulls the wool over...,"I upgraded to 2005 because it was ""required"" to continue electronic bill pay. The upgrade was a disaster so I had to call Tech help...which is when I eventually discovered Intuit had switched the electronic payment service company. I was appalled that they would be so underhanded. I had been working with Checkfree (the company that processed e-payments) for 9 yrs (first directly then through Quicken),was very satisfied with their service and had no intentions of leaving them. Long story short...I am done with Quicken and their electronic billpay!! This switch, without the customer's knowledge, sounds a lot like the ""slamming"" the phone companies used to do. Bottom line is, I may be looking at MS Money to track finances. I never thought Quicken was all that easy to use...certainly not inuitive....no pun ;-))"
2,"Fine, except concerns about QIF support","I have been using this software for the past three months or so and it seems to work fine. However, I do have concerns about the QIF support. It seems that Intuit has taken a page from the monopoly playbook and is forcing institutions to upgrade to the QFX standard. However, Intuit is charging institutions considerable price for this upgrade. I think the price is something like $3 per account, not per $3 institution bank account that uses an Intuit product. For a bank with 50,000 account names, this would translate into a $150,000 payment for Intuit. Going forward, I would expect for more institiutions to take the path of Fidelity and not adopt the new standard. Think about it, if you were a bank technology director would you pay this amount for service that was used by perhaps 15% of your banking clients?"
1,Don't bother unless you know your bank has QFX,"As the other reviewers have mentioned, unless you have a bank who has bowed to Quicken, this program is useless unless you want to hand enter your checking and other bank statements. I didn't get in far enough to figure out if the investment piece was worthwhile. As I understand it, Quicken charges the bank a FEE to allow the downloading of information in a QFX format!"
3,Main fault is lack of QIF import,"I'm having some real issues with my recent upgrade to 2005. The primary problem is that I can no longer import QIF's. Unfortunately, I've overwrote my data files with the new version and according to the customer support, I cannot go back to my earlier version. Intuit suggests that I change banks, I suggest that I replace Quicken 2005 with MS Money.The reason for disabling the QIF import was suggested on Intuit's customer-based support was that Intuit charges financial institutions for use of the new format. I guess if you are giving the software away for almost nothing, you have to expect someone to pay for it."
3,"Solid product, but maintenance release from 2004","I'm a long-time Quicken user, and purchased Quicken Premier 2005 over the weekend (I was previously using Quicken Premier 2004). While a solid release, the changes are minimal and probably not worth upgrading from Quicken 2004.Consequently, I rate the product three-stars for upgraders, but five-stars for new users and those who haven't upgraded in several years."
1,A very flawed product--DO NOT BUY!!!,"I had been a very happy camper with Quicken for many years...until Intuit forced the upgrade to the 2005 version. What used to work flawlessly (Quicken 2002)in terms of bank and stock data downloads now would not work. Four calls to the support line got nowhere, with much fumbling around about Quicken not working well on networks, having problems with firewalls and on and on...no solutions. I finally had to just demand a refund and will now spend the money on MS Money...at least one should expect that to work with Windows XP. I guess Intuit has just gotten too greedy and/or too big...beware..."
5,Mas Alla del Sol,This is one of the best music of this writer/singerI love it . if you like Joan Sebastian you will like this album. Jessie
2,Grossly overrated,"This isn't a terrible CD, and bits of it sound okay at first. Repeated listening, however, will reveal a distinct lack of songwriting skills, some really lame musical ideas and novelty singing that soon grates. This is yet another mediocre group being propped up by the current craze for all things indie, which favors little-known and annoying bands. For vastly better music bearing some superficial similarities to this, consider Blonde Redhead."
1,WHAT'S GOING ON?,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH MUSICIANS,i mean,CHILDREN TODAY? IF THIS IS COMPETITIVE MUSIC AT IT'S BEST, THEN WHY CAN'T I RELEASE MY OWN ALBUM OF CONSTANT WHINING?"
5,A Coming Reformation Driven By Publishers And The Internet,"I had read and enjoyed books by Marcus Borg, John Dominic Crossan and John Shelby Spong before I found HONEST TO JESUS.The most noticeable distinction of Funk's book by contrast seems to be the breadth of his view in his own quest of the historical Jesus. The book is filled with dense material but Funk's readable style helps to make it understandable to the layman.After reading HONEST TO JESUS I am now more convinced than ever that we are indeed beginning to experience a new reformation and the resulting reforms will be driven not by the churches but rather by the publishing industry and the internet."
2,Just Chasing Our Own Tails,"I just finished the definative biography of Wild Bill Hickock, a man famous in his own time who died just over a hundred years ago. Even though there were multiple witnesses and newspaper accounts to every major event in his life, we have no idea what this man really said or did.Now, if we have no chance of knowing exactly what Wild Bill said or did one hundred years ago, what chance do we have of finding out what Jesus said and did 2000 years ago? IT'S ALL JUST THEORY. Sometimes interesting, sometimes boring, but bringing us no closer to who Jesus really was. We're all making these authors rich and famous while learning nothing.This is my last ""historical Jesus"" book. Back to real life."
3,camera cable didn't fit Olympus,"I wanted a spare camera cable for an Olympus digital camera that was given to me by a friend who had upgraded and didn't need the Olympus anymore. I have computers in two locations that I use, and thought it would be handy to just be able to leave a camera cable with each computer. And when I saw the cable for sale for $0.05 (plus $2.95 S & H) I couldn't resist. The write up said it would fit a number of different brands, including Sony, Canon, HP, Olympus, and others. However, it turns out it doesn't fit my Olympus. Not going to worry about it, being as it was almost free, but thought my experience could be entered into the 'data bank'."
2,Right Description wrong cord,"In the description for the USB cord I purchased it list my camera as one that the cord would fit. However, it was not the right cord."
5,Works fine with Garmin GPS as a Car charger.,"Works fine with Garmin GPS as a car charger.Note: You will need to first connect it to garmin GPS and then when garmin gps device recognizes it, disconnect it and then reconnect it back for the GPS to use it as a charger."
3,satisfactory,fabolous's street dreams pt 2 wasnt that bad. i think if he promoted it more and made some more videos and radio hits for it then it would of went at least gold.
4,3.5 star Mixtape,"Fabolous returns with his 3rd ""Album"" in as many years. Although it is a mixtape and only has 12 ""songs"" it is pretty good. Half of the beats are from other artists songs even though they aren't credited. Feature Paul Cain, Joe Budden, Mike Shorey. Has about 4 skippable tracks (I skip numbers 5-8) but the others are real good, but no classics. Fans of his should get it other wise just download the 6 or 7 songs that are worth it.#1 - 9.5 (f/ Paul Cain & Joe Budden - uses Half A Mill's {R.I.P.} ""Some Niggaz"" beat off his album from 2000 - check that out it is a real good album)#2 - 8#4 - 7.5#5 - 5.5#7 - 5 (f/Mike Shorey)#8 - 5 (Has an R. Kelly Beat)#9 - 8 (F/ Joe Budden - uses his beat off his album (2003) as well)#10 - 6.5#11 - 7 (uses the Jay-Z & Eminem song ""Renegade"" beat)#12 - 9.5 (f/ Paul Cain - uses LOX's ""F**k You"" beat off their ""We are the Streets"" album)#13 - 9.5#14 - 5.5b. -- John Jackson -- around 1980 -- Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NYcheck all my reviews"
4,"This was Hot, even for a mixtape","Fabolous came back after his girl adventures, to where he first got his name, the mixtape. I am not gona lie, I was skeptical at first, but I brought off the strength of hearsay. I bumped it hard for about a good two months. The punchlines are getting better and he is tryiong to go back to the streets. Not bad, 3.5 starsTop 3 Songs: Think Ya'LL Know, F U, RegenadeBottom 3 Songs: Faboloso, I Usually Don't, Can't Let You GoSleeper, Now Ride"
3,ItZ FaBoLoSo,man this cd hits pretty good but i think FABOLOUS could do much better most of his songs are 2 min long if it was longer and have some chorus it would be tite but i was jush sayin ya peeps mite think different but o well
3,dont go crazy with this one,"This cd is ALRIGHT, but its nothin like fab's first cd. the one dude who said the cd goes by fast is right, cause its only 45 minutes long. ""think yall know"" is the hottest track. i never really was feelin joe buddens or paul cain. i think fab should ditch the ""streat fam"" and stay on his own instead of tryin to help out whack rappers. bottom line dont buy this one, theres better ish out there. ONE"
1,Not worth your hard earned money,I can't believe how bad this was. I know its a mix tape and all but come one. There is really only one song that I like on it. Number 10 and its only about 2 minutes or so long. I was pissed when I got it. Its not worth your hard earned money. If you haven't bought the other fabolous albums definitely buy them. There tight. Leave this one alone.
4,F.A.B.O.L.O.U.S.,"Fabolous has a great album here. This has a special thing on it, that makes it enhanced is, you can make your own remix of one of the tracks. Fabolous will always have more, more, and more Street Dreams for everyone. This album features the Fire Remix, with Joe Budden. Fire was originally a Busta Rhymes track, then it was a Joe Budden track, now Joe Budden features Fabolous on the Fire Remix. Another track is Think Y'all Know, the track after; Make U Mine video. This, I believe is the best track on the album. Make U Mine, the latest collaboration with Mike Shorey, Make U Mine. Make U Mine is a great video and track. It is a great album. As I said earlier, Fabolous will keep coming out with more, more, more, and more Street Dreams."
5,FABOLOSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this album is fire!!!!!!every track is amazing!!!!!!!!the album goes by fast so you know thats good!!!!!!!the guest appearences are great!!!!!!!!!!and the beats and lyrics are fire!!!!!!!!!!!go cop this album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Its aiight but not gangsta,"this cd stepped up from street dreams volume 1. The similies and punchlines are hotter, but on some real stuff this cd is only half more gangsta than the other one. Fabolous turned sweet all of a sudden, he's more into singin slow remakes of old r&b songs about girls all the time then what he use to freestyle and rap about like ""keepin it gangsta"" or ""I can't deny it"", the most he'd say about girls was funny sex punchlines like ""she wants me to bust in her eye so she can watch my kids"" or ""I wonder if shorty freind can rap so she can spit on my mic"", he just went passionate on rap. His second cd ""Street Dreams"" should be called ""Sweet dreams"" and this one should be called More Sweet Dreams Volume 2(songs to cuddle too)"". i'd give it 2 stars."
5,its a mixtape,"lookin at da reviews.... ppl say it could of been better, a little longer, or probably a chorus.....to all those ppl out there.....read the label...... ""More Street Dreams 2: The Mixtape""so ull hear alot of mixtapes like dat and from FAB ull hear alot of freestyles with DJ Clue to back up the beats"
4,Its AIGHT,This cd Its straight...it could of been betta..and also it could of been a lil longer..But he did good...big ups to fab..ONE
1,Bull crap,"Not just was this CD advertsied and designed poorly, but even the music vidoes from this were cheaply structured. The original Street Dreams CD was da bomb!But this one is a bomb,with maybe a couple good arse tracks."
1,Fabolous and why he is so fabolous,"""Street Dreams"" is definitly a step up from ""Ghetto Fabolous"" which was also a tight album but on Street Dreams, Fab not only comes through with more dope tracks but he improves his lyrical skills and his flow. I'm tired of people hating on F-A and saying he has no lyrical skills when in fact he is probably the most overlooked rapper in the game. What many fools don't notice about Fabolous is that he is really the only rapper who can rhyme the same line over and over again the entire verse inalmost every song he has ever made. He is also one of the most clever lyricists in the game. He even outshined Clipse. SO GIVE FABOLOUS HIS RESPECT!"
1,Excuse for a diary,"This item should not be bought for a diary which is what my granddaughter wanted. I mistakenly bought this because I could not find a diary. She did not make use of it and she is absolutely infatuated with the diary which I found later after getting this one and recognizing that it did not match her expectations. The diary that I found I didn't like because it was only a few pages and it was not a calendar which I feel is what she needs at this time to learn the meaning of the months and seasons etc. However, it met her needs when this one didn't"
3,Fun journal for young girls,"This is a fun, little journal. It's geared more for young girls (think preteen and maybe even teenagers). It would make a great gift. Only con is the silver metallic pen that comes with it tends to leak and you have to wait forever for the ink to dry before you can write on another page."
5,Excellent book!,I bought this book for my step-daughter's birthday. She turned ten this year. After she opened it we barely heard from her for the rest of the day. She absolutely loved it! I am very happy with the Klutz items I have bought for her.
5,Gifts for friends!,I purchased this book for my 12 year-old daughter for Christmas. She spent an hour Christmas day writing in it! It is a wonderful gift for her age. I am ordering 2 more for upcoming birthdays!
3,There Wasn't a Diamond,"Laura Cortese's ""Even the Lost Creek"" sways sweetly to a light country beat. Her voice is gentle and the musicianship is good. The opener ""Blow the Candle Out"" is peppy, although not totally memorable. Josh Ritter's ""Blue Jays"" sounds faceless. Kristin Andreassen & Dan Rose's title tune fares better like a bluesy haunted smoker despite oblique lyrics, ""If your mind is limber, I think you'll see when you mine for lumber, it's coal you seek; Way back there at the roots of my hair there wasn't a diamond, just a living tree."" After several nondescript tracks like ""Morning Comes Around"" & ""The Boat Song,"" Cortese explodes on the lovely ""Just Like Heaven."" A couple Celtic instrumentals, the ballad ""Jack Orion"" and the closer ""Night Train to Chelsea"" follow without much impression. There's not a lot of spark. Cortese catches fire momentarily before napping through most of the disc. It's okay, neither awful nor wonderful. Enjoy!"
5,Revolution - The Evolution of the Coin Vanish,"Revolution is a complete coin vanish like no other. It steps away from other coin vanishes because it requires no palming or gimmicks, it can be done anywhere at anytime, and leaves your audience in disbelief. With Revolution I've received incredible reactions from family, friends, and total strangers, but nothing will top the street magician I left stunned on the Las Vegas Boulevard. The technique is brilliant, easy to learn, and taught in step by step detail by Brad Christian. The DVD is in studio quality, short and to the point, but as always with Ellusionist DVD's, it's packed with great tips, so you can perform this effect in the best way possible to create maximum impact. I highly recommend this DVD for everyone from first day beginners to seasoned professionals."
3,Unmistakably Elida,"This album was released when the group was basically unknown, but the skill of the group and Elida's unmistakable vocals are a must- hear. ""Luna Llena"" wins my pick for best of the album, ""Duele"" fans will love it."
1,Not as good as I expected it to be,"The worst EYA album. I was really let down with this album. It's certainly doesn't live up to ""EYA 1998""."
2,Tastes awful,I wanted to try tea tree oil toothpaste so I bought a couple. This one was awful - very medicinal tasting and didn't leave my mouth feeling refreshed. I much prefer Jason Healthy Mouth. It too has tea tree oil. It tastes a little medicinal but not too bad and it refreshes your mouth.
1,"Maybe I have no sense of humour, but...","I read this book ages ago. It drove me insane. I simply hate this sort of book where outlandish things happen that don't make sense and it's supposed to be symbolic somehow but the symbolism goes right over my head.Perhaps if I read it again, i'd get it, but it really was just rather mind-numbingly dumb in a way. Especially the afflictions of the other characters. And the main character's husband. Dang, he was irratating."
3,Me dumb male. Not get funny book.,"This book was recomended to me by a close friend who had the book assigned in a feminst theory class. She thought I might enjoy the interesting notion of a woman losing her uterus in a shopping mall. While I did find the book interesting in that aspect, and definetly orginal in its content, I just had a hard time getting into it. It seemed like it was over before it began, and it really didn't seem to go anywhere. It was a fun little trip, but very weird, and a bit too short."
1,A HUGE disappointment,"I love modern books by modern women -- Kate Atkinson, Liz Jensen, Lisa Alther -- that have a sense of the irrational. I also love trawling the Fiction aisles for new women writers. Naturally I was intrigued by this title, and bought it to read -- what a letdown! This is book has no plot -- a woman loses her uterus, looks for it, gets scared that she'll never find it, then finds it. Big deal. It's completely improbable, but not even in a fun way -- reading about some guy using a power drill to try to re-open a woman's bloodless vagina, with skins shards flying everywhere, made me positively sick. This is not the type of thing where a woman will get it, and a man won't -- I'm a woman, and to me this book SUCKED."
4,STRAVINSKY IN THE MATRIX???,"I love reading the reviews from the fans of the movie. sometimes I do it to see how much does the audience know. out of the whole album there's only one track that I like: NEODAMMERUNG.. sounds very much like Stravinsky's overtures from one of his operas, but the use of the choir makes it apocalyptic...I think is not that bad..."
4,Revolutionary,"Here is the soundtrack to the final movie in the Matrix trilogy. Don Davis is a master, and Juno Reactor are masters of what they do, which is electronica. Put them together and you have nothing less than a masterpiece. I know this is not the first time that techno has been fused with classical orchestra, but it is always great. This is all score, with the exception of the one song that was in the ""club scene"", but that just blends in so nicely with the rest of the music that it doesn't even sound awkward. The last track is also the greatest. This album ends with a bang. If you have enjoyed these movies as well as the music and soundtracks then you will enjoy this."
3,soundtrack,"Hi, i think the movie was quite cool, especially the 1st fighting part. does anybody know the title of the song they played after the show ended? as in while they were playing the credits. it sounded a bit like some woman singing opera or something."
2,"This is a MUSICAL SCORE, not a soundtrack","The CD soundtracks to the first two movies were true soundtracks. Lots of good pop/rock tracks by different artists. The original film score was sold seperately, and clearly labeled as a ""score"". The Reloaded 2-disc set contained both a ""soundtrack"" and a ""score"". This Revolutions ""soundtrack"" is purely a musical score...there are no pop/rock singles, cool Rob Dougan tracks, or anything of the sort. The music that is included isn't all that impressive, either...mostly a rehash of the music from the first two movies, or bland pseudo-house music. Don't bother, especially if you've already purchased either of the scores for one of the previous two movies."
2,Not what it seems,"I was very dissapointed with this album; it seems that it was improperly labelled. The music is good but it is simply the MOVIE SCORE, not the MOVIE SOUNDTRACK. If you like dark, instrumental music with a touch of electronic sounds this is an excellent CD, but many of the songs in the movie were not listed. Once again THIS CD IS A SCORE, NOT A SOUNDTRACK."
5,After all the reviews,"After all the reviews I read at Amazon.com, I am thoroughly disappionted not to see a playlist. How do you expect people to buy a CD with out knowing whats on it? I personally am not going to buy some random CD when i want to know who sings what songs...Thank you Amazon for persuading me not to buy this soundtrack from you, and not getting any profit from me whatsoever."
3,Not like the previous two soundtracks at all,"While the music is good, I must say I was seriously disappointed with it. When I picked it up in the store, I saw that there were no songs played by bands, just music made by a fellow named Don. I hesistated for a while to buy it or not, I did. I found the music to be good, albeit very similar to typical movie background music, but was very let down by the lack of the great music that made the first two soundtracks amazing.In short, good movie music, but as far a music CDs go, not nearly as good as the first two soundtracks. Love the matrix."
4,Better than Expected,"Beautiful cupcake! I got this as a christmas gift from my boyfriend. The combination of the necklace and mathing box makes a touching personal gift. The box is fantastic, and both the box and the pendant were a lot larger than I expected from reading reviews and looking at the photos. Overall I am very happy with the necklace.However: The chain is very thin, I am in the process of finding a new one because I am afraid I am going to break it and the clasp is tiny and hard to fasten. Would not reccomend for someone with arthritius."
5,Too Sweet!,"Purchased for my son to give to his girlfriend, he calls her ""Cupcake"". For an inexpensive necklace you can't go wrong with this one, IMO. The necklace I received was filled with sparkle, no tangled chain....AND.....the cupcake box is too cute, charming and oh, so sweet!I purchased several jewelry items in lightning round deals, and this by far was my best purchase, certainly exceeded my expectations! Even though the chain is thin as others have mentioned, most of these under $100 necklaces are going to have a more delicate chain."
3,"Nice, but...",Nice package it came in but the tiny chain that the pendant came with broke on the second time it was used. If you purchase this - be prepared to buy another chain because this one will not do the job.
5,Lovely gift for all occasions,"I bought this necklace for my sister-in-law for Christmas. I really liked it not only because of its unusual design, but because it came in a cute porcelain cupcake-shaped box. She loved it. The price is nice for a gold necklace.Granted, the chain is very thin, but that seems to be the norm these days, even on necklaces costing five times this much. I have just reconciled myself to the fact that I will send a better, stronger chain on the next gift-giving occasion."
5,Cupcake only,The cupcake was gorgeous but the chain was so thin it arrived all tangled I wound up tossing it and using another gold chain. I loved the cupcake itself. It was worth the money even without the chain.
4,Diamond Cupcake,"My girl just loved the necklace, she wears it all the time and receives a lot of compliments. The cupcake box is a real cool package. Kudos!"
3,so disappointed,I was so excited to see my package on the front porch but my excitement turned to dismay. Mine came with the chain tangled in a knot so tight that I couldn't begin to fix it. I know that I can return and have it replaced...but what a disappointment.
3,cupcake pendant,It was nice. It came in a ceramic cupcake but the hinge was broken and it was poorly crafted but I was buying the pendant
3,Crazy chain,"The pendant is worth the money, it looks good. But like everyone else has said...the chain comes in a tangled mess. I had to trash it."
3,Yummy,The cupcake was cute. The chain was very thin. This pendant is more for a child than an adult. It would be better if you gave the size of the chain in the description .
3,Great Disposable Knife Set,"Bought this set from Pfaltzgraff for a Jackson and they were well worth it. (Definitely not worth the retail price)I am a professional chef and take great care of my expensive knifes but wanted something that I could use and abuse at home and not worry about. They were razor sharp right out of the box and kept their edge for at least 6 months before I had to really sharpen them. The sharpening steel is worthless, I think its what chipped the knives, I just used my own.Don't be fooled, these are cheap knives and they will start to rust and chip. But if you want a nice looking set that you can use and not worry about ruining then buy these knives."
1,Rust,"My son bought me this set for Christmas. Six months later, some have rust spots. They do not go in the dishwasher."
1,Not as advertized,"Beware, the picture clearly shows a Santoku knife but that is not what you get. You get a cleaver, to me a cleaver has little to no value in the kitchen. My decision to buy this set was made because of the santoku knife. Very disappointed, I probably will not expend the effort to return the item just because I do not want to go through tthe hassle."
4,faberware knife set,"Bought it in wal-mart 3 moth ago.They ok, but just ok knifes.I'd recommend to look for something better for that price."
1,Not worth the money!,"This book was highly recommended by the instructor of a course I am taking as a ""great all-around"" book. There is no index and the references are scant. The author has found a ""new"" (not really) ""gimmick"" and I'm sure she makes a bundle giving in-services to districts; BUT the only thing I found at all useful were the 2 pages with clarifiers for objectives. The rest was shallow and juvenile. Save your money for a worthwhile purchase."
5,"Divina Comedia, La","Esto es una obra maestra, nunca ha leido un libro como la Divina Comedia de Dante, cuando lo lees puedes dejar de leer, es un obra maestra"
2,Content excellent - bad format and structure of book for mobile devices,The book is one of mi favorites of all times but the format of this book is very ugly for mobile devies even for mobile phones with big displays... the format only use a fraction of the pague and the reading in relative small displays is neer to imposible.
3,1976 film about possessed child..,"After a terrible car accident twenty years ago killed his father and sister, a man returns to his family home with his wife and daughter.The daughter takes up residence in her deceased aunt's room and, after finding some of her possessions, becomes possessed by her spirit. Soon strange happenings and mysterious deaths begin to occur in the household as the possessed girl lashes out at those around her."
3,Cathy's Curse,"Years after his father and sister were killed in an automobile accident, a man marries and brings his new family back to his first home. once there, his daughter undergoes horrible changes as she falls under the curse of his long dead aunt!"
5,"If you like CX at all, you need this album","CX has always been better live than in the studio (just ask them), so if you like their mid-period stuff (or their early music, some of which is also on this album), you'll probably like this even more. When I first found this album, it was a cool rare import, and the only chance I had to hear Cassandra Complex live, so maybe my view was a bit skewed. So, now that the album is no longer rare and expensive, and now that I've gotten to see them live, I went back and listened to it again. And it's as great as ever. The songs have more energy, you get to hear Rodney interact with the audience, and there's a great selection of music from their career (up to that point)."
3,A very nice faucet,"We received our Culinaire kitchen faucet within a week. It was well-packed and had a nice two-toned stainless finish. We decided to have it installed by a professional plumber to avoid future problems. However, within 10 days one of the gray plastic pieces on top of the pull-out fell out and landed in the disposal. We contacted American Standard directly and were told that we'd have a new pull-out within 7-10 days. 2 weeks later, having not received the replacement, we contacted American Standard again and were told the piece was back-ordered with no delivery date in sight. The company was wonderful in working to obtain a new pull out for us which they eventually did. The new one arrived in perfect condition. This was a frustrating process, but good follow through by American Standard. We'd re-rate the faucet 4/5 (did the first review after 2 months of having not received a replacement)."
5,Impresionante / I'm definitely amazed,"[...]I neger got the chance to have this awesome album and is definitely my favorite aurora album. It's filled with such beautiful songs! of course, Horas, was definitely memorable and for sure the best album of 1997 in mexico but this album shows a more mature sound and lyrics with their own genre (flower pop). As soon as I see this album for sale I'd buy it wihout even thinking twice and without even looking at the price... definitely a rarity.[...]"
5,Autism car magnet,Nice large magnet to display on your car to show your support for autism. A good price for this size magnet.
3,"Secrets, Secrets","When a baby is snatched in the night, the lives of three women are forever changed.The kidnapping of her daughter twenty-three years ago still haunts Ellie Nightingale, and her obsession with having another child is driving a wedge between her and her husband.Kate Sutton has spent those same twenty-three years hiding the most soul-wrenching decision of her life from the rest of the world while learning to cope with her disability.And Skyler Sutton is a champion equestrian for whom no hurdle is ever too high until she is challenged by her impossible love for a tough-talking New York City cop.This fascinating novel is ""Trail of Secrets"" by Eileen Goudge. It will capture your heart in the first chapter and keep you reading until the conclusion."
4,Nicely done.,"This story is about a girl who gets pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption. This is no ordinary adoption story and the reader knows this all along. Most characters do not realize what is going on until the end. This story has rich characters, colorful dialouge and an interesting premise. I was not disappointed."
2,Three neurotic women search for the happiness of motherhood,"This book was charged with the barely controlled emotions of Ellie, Kate and Skyler. It was exhausting to read of these women who were frequently on the verge of fainting. The male characters were poorly developed and served only as props for these self centered women."
2,Dollar Cd,"I bought this cd for a dollar. I picked it out because I liked the cover. Hey, sometimes you can judge a cd by its cover, not so much in this case though.This band sounds similar to a lot of rock bands right now such as the killers or whatever. I don't really listen to music like that and this cd is just rehash of that.1. 6/10 Decent song2. 5/10 The beginning riff is cool, the rest of the song is pretty dull.3. 7/10 Good song, I like the guitar in the beginning.4. 4/10 Hardest song on the album, but not very good5. 5/10 Eh boring songOk so this album is pretty dull/cliche overall. Sorry to be blunt."
1,not happy!,I ordered Ball salt and pepper shakers--they are Harvest and not Ball ones! I will be sending them back when I am at home later this month....
3,Live From the Fall is better,"I picked up Live on the Rocks at a secondhand music store and it's worth what I paid for it ($7). If your a Blues Traveler fan, though, your money's much better spent on Live From the Fall than this album. For one, Live From the Fall is a double album, which means more Blues Traveler good-ness for your buck.This album is decent, but doesn't hold a candle to Live From the Fall."
1,Disappointed,Returned these cubes. Some damage. Doors will not hold up with only plastic hinges. Not bad if you're not going to be accessing them often. The plain cubes seem to be a good buy and are pretty sturdy.
2,"The top broke when I set a lamp on it--granted the lamp was heavy and I was only setting there for a moment, still cracked!",Can't believe the top cracked when I put a lamp on top of it! Too thin for placing anything on it
3,"Looks Professional, Quality...mehhh","I purchased three sets (of four) for a Flag Football league we have here in Southern California. After about three weeks of use, a few of these started leaking sand out of the bottom. The stitching came un-done and had to be repaired. So far, after five weeks of games we have had to repair four pylons. Luckily we have a seamstress on staff and she does a great job. The stitching isn't very thick or strong, so you may have to make some repairs. Other than that, they look great, serve their purpose. If treated carefully (which ours may just get thrown around), they should last you a while, but you may have to make some repairs in the meantime."
5,Excellent Product,"I have struggled for 5 years with several different varieties of Pylons. There were a hassle. I was about to buy some that had magnets, but I would have had to bury magnets in the ground. No guarantee that the football field would be located in exactly the same place next year.Then I saw these on Amazon. They do not require magnets. The only possible downside is that they are fairly heavy. Bought them and got them in time for the first football game. Compared to all the other ones that we had, these are a dream.When I watched several NFL games, I saw the exact same pylons being used. I guess that's why they are called ""Pro Down"".Amazon got them to me in the promised two days, and I was set to go. I would recommend to anyone."
5,"Amazing, but long!","I don't want to spoil things for anyone so I will keep it short. This anime is simply AMAZING! Truly one of the best I've ever seen; however, it is over 100 episodes already, so prepare to dish out a lot of money if you plan to buy the entire series. Season 1 was great, season 2 was better, and season 3...well, I'm still waiting on season 3, but it will probably be 50 episodes as well and will probably stop there. You're looking at over $500 if you're buying the series. They really should just include 1 whole season for 50$, or at least half..."
5,avicenna,"most of the basic information , or the fundation of medicine lies before that man , he explained it in a way no one ever think , or realize the value of everything in our body."
5,I am very glad to have bought this book.,Canon of MedicineI have received this book in a proper way and it was in a very good condition.Nothing was wrong with my pruchase.Thanh you very much and congratulations.Elizabete (Brasil)
5,Interesting but factual,"Well written, holds my attention and I can learn all about my county history!It was a pretty exciting time!"
3,not sure if this was taken from the original,I read the orignal bound book at my aunts. I wanted the exact book because my family is from southern Ill.
5,"Awesome Quality, Must for Racing Fans","This video is awesome. The quality is incredible. I love the action of the races, and while some of the shots are dizzying, they are also all breathtaking. The famous crash from this year was not included in the video, so don't worry about that, or don't expect to be able to see it on here if you are curious. I will probably buy every year that is released, and I hope that they will live up to this quality standard that they set. This is a beautiful display of pure racing, and I would definitely recommend purchasing it."
5,Homeland Security,A Excellent Book to read and study about the way Homeland Security is setup and how they handle differ situations. I would think it is a book that all Law Enforcement should read to understand how Homeland Security works.
3,Good reference book,"This book was used as a textbook in my university-level class on homeland security last semester. It is as comprehensive as the title suggests: it covers weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), cyberterrorism, biological warfare and dirty bombs. It is scary to think about what could potentially be used as a weapon in the hands of the wrong people, but the book offers common sense advice and a clearer understanding of the motivations behind terrorist attacks."
1,"Boring, and everything's possessed",Some freaky girl who lives in a puny village gets called to a castle by a possessed mountain. She meets a posessed troll. She also meets a possessed frog. She gets scared of a possessed ogre. Then her body gets replenished by possessed gargoyles. She gets stuck in possessed snow. She finds a ring. She meets a dweeb of a prince( one of the only characters that isn't possessed). Her life goes back to normal. Whoop-dee-doo! Never read this book.
5,I love it and im fifteen years old,"When I was little I used to make my mom read it to me. I think she read that book a total of 6 times, we read it so much that the book fell apart. I hope this helps you decide to purchase this book. I also hope that it brings as much joy to your kids as it did me."
2,Beware!!!!,"This product is such a disappointment. I originally was pleased with the delivery and overall appearance of this product. I have only had it for three months and I didn't even remove it from the package for a month. Once I did, I still did not use it as a throw, I draped it on the back of the couch. This blanket began unraveling the first day out of the package. It is still unraveling as I type. Horrible quality and think you should know what to expect."
1,Beautiful Design - Horrible Craftsmanship,"I received this blanket as a Christmas present, I'm a huge Snoopy fan and was so excited. I pulled it out of the package and immediately noticed it's much thinner than most triple woven throws, there were also a ton of snags in it. The snags are fixable, but the main problem is it unravels constantly. I've already lost at least 10 threads and I've only had it a week. I'm trying to figure out how to fix that problem, but since I don't knit I'm not positive how I can without messing up the blanket. It's a disappointment to say the least.UPDATE: Two weeks later, the blanket has unraveled so much the two layers are coming apart."
5,Excellent Wireless Router,"A terrific product, very dependable and easy to set up. Great two year product support. Highly recommended!!!"
3,"Easy set up, but mysterious drops","I decided to move up to g from b, from linksys to MS. No setup problems, ran great straight out of the box. But, and this is the reason for three stars, the router just drops connections at random. I read an earlier review that mentioned the same thing. I've looked for fixes on the MS site, but no mention of the issue when I last looked (I'm in Iraq for another four months, so maybe by the time I get back, there will be a firm ware fix). If you don't mind resetting your router anywhere from once a day to several times a day, no issues. If,like me, you find it annoying, stay away."
2,Router not a finished product yet,"This router has several serious bugs, the main one being it keeps loosing the internet connection through a cable modem. About every 5-10 minutes you have to reset both modems to regain the connection. A widespread and consistant problem, amoung others. See: microsoft.public.broadbandnet.hardware newgroup before you buy! No word from MS on a fix, don't seem to care."
5,Very good product.,"Easy setup, inexpensive, reliable, and Wi-Fi certified. Very good range when combined with D-Link's DWL-G650 card (Microsoft's MN-720 card has shorter range)."
2,You should expect more from a wireless router...,"One big issue I have is intermittent disconnects, maybe once or twice an hour. Not a big deal for the average surf the web, read some email user, but as an multi-player gamer, I can't stand being disconnected. I don't know what the router is doing when it drops, I imagine a firmware update may fix this (one day). I have 2 PC's connected, and they both drop, so it's definately the router. I've had experiences with MANY different wireless routers, and I wish I listened to the little voice inside my head when I bought this one. I wanted to try Microsoft, I was curious how their entry into the hardware market would play out. As they say, curiousity killed the cat, and Microsoft belongs in software. If you don't mind a disconnect here or there, and you really want to save $30...then buy Microsoft...otherwise, stick with the network hardware companies...Linksys, Netgear, Belkin. So does anyone want to buy a slightly-used MN-700 wireless router?"
3,Some problem as the nov2 review,"Yep...the base station kept on disconnecting. I was able to update the software, fairly easily...after a few tries. (you can download it on your desktop and install it later) but you have to be online to update the firmware from 207.something to 208.something. While it was searching for updates, it would sometimes discconect, instead of canceling, I kept unplugging and re-plugging the base station (this resets the connection)...I was about to take it back but I decided to give it one more chance....hmmmm...maybe it responds to threats better....><"
3,"Hardware works, but instructions need rewriting","I bought the MN-700 wireless router because it's much cheaper than the other brands. I followed the instructions per the foldout guide and couldn't get the router to recognize my cable modem. Also, the documentation stated I would get prompts for certain things and I never got these prompts. After an hour or so of reviewing the documentation, I decided to follow my gut and rebooted my computer, turned off the cable modem and router and restarted everything. After that, everything worked fine. I don't have any connection drops and getting my laptop to recognize the wireless was very easy."
1,Does not work with DSL,"The router does not work with Bellsouth DSL. I spent two hours on the phone with tech support without resloution. There is a probelm with this router dropping off while using the PPPoE. Tried configuring dynamically but could not. All my research told me the same assumption: IF YOU HAVE DSL AND WANT A ROUTER THAT WORKS WELL, FORGET MICROSOFT!!!!!!Thankfully i still had my receipt. I took it back and got a Linkys router instead."
1,If you are smart pick anything else,"I have had this router for 5 months and every week I kick myself for not buying a replacement the week before. I have seen other complaints that are the same issues that I am having, dropped connections, having to unplug the unit wait plug it back in check to see if the wireless is working...it's not...repeat. You can unplug the unit then plug it back in and it will reboot but the unit will tell you, by the ready light, that the wireless is not up. ...it tells you it is broke.... most of the time the ""it's broke"" feature is broke. I would not buy anything that breaks so often that it needs a broke indicator."
1,Drops connection all the time.,"I bought it because it was cheap and from microsoft. The next day they discontinued it. Now, I have all kinds of problems with the thing not being able to renew the ip address. I have a strong signal but nothing. The software to set up the hardware is useless. You have to be a power user to set the thing up and still will spend days debugging. The router works super great once the ""rarely working"" connection is established."
1,NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME,"Indeed, installing MN 700 is very simple. Except, after it is installed, it does not work. My network and Internet drops after 2-3 minutes. All the free advice on Microsoft webside is worth every penny of the cost. I spent over two hours with a technician who tried to be very helpful. One problem, she was unable to resolve my issues."
4,Cable length is important,"I purchased this as a replacement for a Linksys BEFSR41 for two reasons; the Linksys did not maintain a connection with my ReplayTV 4500, and I got a Wi-Fi laptop.Setup of the MN-700 was easy and the LAN connections were fast and stable. The problem was that the MN-700 would not link up with my Toshiba PCX2200 cable modem. The 3' Cat 5 I had been using with the Linksys did not work. Neither did a couple of 6 footers that worked elsewhere. It was not until I connected the two with a 10' Cat 5 that I got a link. Not sure why this is, but it appears cable length is important."
1,So many problems installing on Win ME,"Opened box and attempted install. Software keeps locking up...Internet Extorter won't open when connected to router (works fine when connected to cable modem directly). After much fussing about, got the software to configure and load correctly but requires unplugging network cable from computer first. Also, compared to other router products I've used, the web interface is SLOWWWWWWWW...noticed this device is running WinCE...hmmm.Works ok with win2k, but can't connect my Orinoco Silver (802.11b) to the router (may be a card issue rather than router).Highly recommend investigating other choices from established netoworking companies that don't release beta products!"
1,plain awful.,"difficult to install, very inconsistant with connection. again, very difficult to install, and i'm a multi computer user. it is awful, stay away, and get a regular router."
1,Stick to software Microsoft,"I unpacked the box and followed the instructions to load the supplied software. That part went easily. Then I cabled the router to the cable modem and to the PC, and switched on. The software wizard failed to find the router and refused to proceed. I tried turning things on and off, rebooted my PC several times, removed my firewall software because the help said that could be the issue. Eventually I removed it from the cable modem and tried to connect it just to my PC. Still no joy.So I took it back and bought a NetGear Router. WOW NetGear know how to make stuff. It took 5 minutes to get it going and another 5 to setup my security and preferences. No software needed. I then plugged my Vonage VoIP box into the setup and it all worked perfectly.Microsoft stick to making software leave hardware to the people who know how to do it."
1,DONT BUY THIS...FOR U WILL LOSE UR MONEY!!,"I am all about XBOX and wanted to get wireless with MS products. You think MS will always come up w/ great products. WRONNNNNNNNNG!!!!! This router just sucks!! I mean, I got my cable internet and the router the same day. So I tried the router. Well, the internet connection fell at least TWICE a day!!! I blamed the ISP because I trusted MS. Wrong again. Its just the router. Horrible connection!! Dont always trust MS. I strongly recommend the LINKSYS!!! Very reliable they are."
1,waiting for the third version,"the first and second versions of Microsoft stuff sucks, right? I guess we need to wait for the third version, because this one isn't working. Friendly telephone support, though."
1,Doesn't work well with PPP networks!,"I do consider myself tech savvy, and yet spent an unsuccessful 5 hours diagnosing why it wouldn't play well with a PPPoE DSL account. Finally gave up and will have to bite the bullet on Comp USA's crappy 15% restocking fee.Perhaps an option NOT to use the ""Wizard""? Microsoft, are you listening? Putting stickers everywhere to ""MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE FIRST"" is a real turn off!"
3,So-so Wi-fi,I haven't used other wireless routers but this one was not an ideal solution. The biggest problems are the disconnects and the speed in that order. It wasn't really simple to set up either though not overwhelmingly difficult. I have a D-link 704 which is wired but connects much faster than the mn700 even when both are wired. There is a half-1 second delay on the mn700 to bring up pages. Plus the most annoying factor is that the router drops connection at varying times.
2,Wireless connection and DHCP has problems....,"I get this MN-700 to replace MN-500, what a mistake!1. DHCP sometimes hand out IPs out of the setting range.2. Wireless keeps on droping and reconnecting. That makes downloading large files almost impossible.3. In b/g mix mode, b mode client may not be able to connect.I know people will argue that interferrence (from 2.4GHz appliances) is the cause of disconnection, but my MN-500 never has the same problem. Microsoft seems slow (or not at all) release the fixes for this model. :("
1,Bad router,I've had this router for a while now and have tolerated it for far too long. The firmware is no longer being updated and Microsoft blatantly ignores the large amount of customers who have complained for 2+ years about connectivity problems. Google the model number for yourself to see common complaints.It boils down to this unit being unstable. Connections will drop frequently. Windows mobile devices in particular have a hard time connecting. And in general the device does not respond nicely when you disconnect/re-connect.Be sure to read one of the reputable online review sites before you buy (this applies to any computer device)!
2,did MS test this product?,"Shouldn't have been released to market.5 stars for: Asthetic design, functional web-based interface, good range, priceIf unit worked as it should, it would get 5 stars.3 star deduction for: working for 5 minutes and then failing, broadcasting SSID but not accepting connections (wired or wirelessly) due to non-responsive DHCP server, technically support that has too many layers (open a case, call back on case to confirm issues, then a call from a technician), transformer at end of plug, inability of tech support to resolve issues. Basically said they were aware of the issues and have a firmware update in testing, e.t.d. 2-3 weeks.Tried 3 units without success. Wait for updated firmware before buying."
4,Wireless Router,"Good functioning router for local, home use. Could be a bit challeging to integrate with internet provider/modem, depending on what you use. Don't expect to get top data transmission; too many variables within each network system."
5,Karen is da bomb,"This cd is on point. Can't nobody i mean nobody touch Karen. She has to be the Baddest woman walking right now, yeah i said it. This album is off the chain and if ne body don't agree listen to it again cause your missing something. She can reach young and older listeners now thats talent. Her voice is incredible. I have never heard nobody sing and hit notes from A to Z like she does. Trust, you defenitely wanna pick this cd up."
5,incredibly awesome,"I am new to gospel music and this is the ultimate addition to my collection. I was moved and inspired. Cannot put the CD down, brings tears to my eyes to moved by the spirit through good music. Karen is truly talented and has passed the legacy on to her daughter. A CD for all ages and all genres to be inspired by."
4,Wow!,"I bought this album because I heard ""You love me"" on the radio. It is a gospel cover of the the Jill Scott song. The song is so annointed. Can anyone do the echo effect like that? And her daughter is amazing, again. No one can tell me that the ability to sing is not in your genes. The Clark family proves this over and over again. Love it !!"
5,Definitely ALL THAT!,"The title cut is a wonderful tribute to God. And cut # 6 - You Loved me - I can't find words to describe how sweet it is. I'd call it ""Ear Candy"" I suppose. There's plenty of funk and appeal for all ages. Mary Mary, Missy Elliot, her daughter Kierra Sheard, along with other great make appearances. Just plain good music! Thank God for it."
2,What Happened ?,"I have listened to this CD a few times and I can't find the Karen Clark that i am use to listening to. Don't get me wrong the songs are great but there is something lacking on this CD.I expected more, and if you are a fan of the Clarks you know what I am talking about."
3,Pretty good!,"But it could have been better. My favorite album by Karen Clark-Sheard was the first one ""Finally Karen"" which I thought was the best one. It had more of a variety. ""The Heavens are telling"" is too short and has too many slow songs. The revibe of Jill Scott's ""He loves me"" only sounds good because of Kierra Sheard's runs. I think she is going to be able to rap circles around her mother when she becomes of age. She's more on Twinkie Clark's level and likes to jazz it up like Aunt Dorinda.My favorites are #1 ""We acknowledge you"", and #10 ""Sometimes"" which I think is the best song on the album. It's more contemporary and radio friendly. The rest of the cd I can skip through. Even the song with Mary Mary which didn't even match their format. I wouldn't have known that it was them if Karen hadn't announced it. I hope the next album is better."
5,The Heavens Are definately Telling!!!!,"From beginning to end, this CD will have you keeping it on repeat for hours. It starts off with a nice upbeat anthem unto God, and ends with a nice duet with her daughter, also with an upbeat sound. Guess you'll have to buy it to know about the other songs!!!"
4,what you would expect from a text book,"This book is very good at editing the cases to give you only the parts of the opinions that you need. On the other hand, the comments are often useless as they only pose question after question for about half a page rather than offering any useful insight into the materials."
2,Snail-paced,"I read all the ""Tales Of . . ."" books with enthusiasm. I was surprised to find this first in a new series so slow-moving. It was hard to find a plot through all the boring details. There was a surge of hope on pages 116 and 208, but this book never got going as far as I was concerned. Even Joliffe, from The Servant's Tale, lost his charming and witty personality in this one. It seemed as if the people using the Margaret Frazer pen name lent it to somebody else."
5,Joliffe,Quite a guy. Margaret Frazer's descriptions of that era of British history show much research. Such trials players endured then.
1,Not as Advertised,"This product was advertised as an Oxygen Bleach Stain Remover, and I thought I had found the solution to the blueberry stain in my sink. However, it turned out to be for pet stains. As I have a dog, I am well fixed with pet stain removers, and this product is totally useless to me."
5,Space kidettes/young Samson,"Recieved all my favorite cartoons a definite blast from the past. Purchased the following items: Space kidettes/Young Samson. Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor complete series. Shazzan complete series. Herculoids complete series. All came in excellent package condition. Clear quality picture dvd's. All arrived together on day indicated. Thank you, look forward to future orders."
1,major overheat problem,"I had four laptop computers before this one. It is the most noisiest one I own. The cooling fan will go on and off every 15 seconds. Usually, I have it on 8 hours per day. It is too annoying and the weight of this laptop also too heavy to carry around. Over price and not a lot of softwares."
2,This notebook is THICK !!!,"I was at Fry's Electronics last week and happened to see this notebook on display. The first thing I noted was that just the keyboard-base of the notebook, with its lid open, was thicker than most other notebooks closed! So, out of curiosity, I closed the lid to realize that this thing is 2 inches thick. That's like two notebooks stacked together!The notebook itself is not bad in terms of performance and features. Buy it ONLY if you don't plan to take this thing around with you. Otherwise, you'll get stares from people not admiring your laptop but a bit amused by its thickness!"
2,how about an iBook?,"I checked out the customer reviews for this Toshiba after reading the ones for the Apple iBook and was struck by how much more positive folks were about the iBook, including Windows users switching to the Mac. Plus, the iBook reviews were written before Apple upgraded the iBook line-up May 20 -- while keeping prices the same -- and now it's an even nicer machine. So folks might want to check out the new iBooks to see if they might make more sense than a PC notebook. (I have an ""old"" iBook and love it -- 5 stars! -- but Apple is tempting me again!)."
3,Viva Las Vegas! Baby!,"Typical of the DK guides, more fluff than substance, but nice to have as a souvenir. Nice color photos throughout, and nice drawings, too. Buy this afterward to remember your trip. Buy Frommers beforehand to get the real meat and potatoes."
3,Good but not great,"The mat is thick and provides more than adequate cushioning/padding. It is comfortable to use for most pilates/yoga/floor exercises. However, the lines are length-wise, and do not provide any help to keep it from sliding around. On very smooth flooring (i.e. laminate) the mat not only slides, but it also stretches. This can make some poses and exercises difficult to do properly which can lead to injury. Also, while the material is really soft and cushy, it is also easy to tear or scrape. So, if you are mainly interested in the amount and quality of padding, this is a good mat. Just be aware of its flaws."
4,Lots of Cushion,"I've only used the mat once so far for hot yoga, but if you don't want to feel the hard ground underneath you while you do mat workouts I would suggest this mat."
3,GoFit Pilates Mat,"I wanted a yoga mat that was a little thicker for the extra support. This mat definitely is thicker and has a lot of cushion, but it is very big and bulky to carry around."
5,Great mat!,"This mat arrived quickly after ordering. It has no smell, which is a plus. My husband and I work out in the basement and there is no padding between the carpet and concrete floor. We've tried thinner mats, but after a few minutes, it becomes painful. But this mat has enough cushion and works great! We ordered one, loved it so much, we ordered another."
3,Somewhat satisfied.,"Received the package in a timely manner but the shipping carton was not a good fit and was ripped. The package was too big and the mat heavy so it shifted to one side. The thin cardboard around the mat from the manufacturer was very ripped and the mat had some pressure dents but no rips. Also, as noted by someone else, the picture shows lines going horizontally across the width of the mat. In reality, there are long lines running vertically from top to bottom. I haven't had a chance to use the mat yet due to surgery but I am assuming it will work fine for pilates. If I could have found the perfect ""mail-back package"", I might have returned it. I am hoping the lines parallel to my feet will not interfere with balance poses. I think having the lines perpendicular to my feet would grasp better."
2,Low density makes this mat feel thin,"I bought three of these mats for my Pilates studio. They were similar in size, thickness, and description to some discontinued mats I bought & loved (from another company) a few years ago. They were also comparably priced. When I got the mats I liked the size, shape and feel of them, but quickly realized that their thickness in particular was deceiving. The mats have so much give or squish to them that you feel like you are sticking to them because your body sinks into it - almost to the point of feeling the floor. Your body leaves an imprint in the mat even after a few seconds of standing or sitting on it. My clients take these mats out of the pile last because no one likes them.Bottom line: Don't waste your money on these cheap mats - I would return them if I could!"
2,Too slick...,"If you don't sweat, this is probably a great mat. Doing various P90X workouts with this mat, has driven me to use my wife's cheap yoga mat instead. In a downward dog pose or even pushups, you'll lose your grip easily on this one. The thickness, and the length of the mat is nice. I might even say it is too thick - I transport it, so its not great for that, unless you get a strap to keep it rolled up. For the right purpose I think it's fine, but if you need your hands to hold a grip on it, I'd probably look at a yoga mat..."
4,Excellent pilates mat,This mat is perfect for pilates. It is thick enough to give excellent stability and comfort. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good pilates mat. Well worth the money!
1,Warning not mentioned,"I bought this mat after reading all the positive reviews but here is what was written on the box and is also listed on the product description at GoFit website:WARNING: This product may contain a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."
2,Concerns about quality,"Just started to use. Thickness, density, size all very good. However edges started to curl right away and concerned that it will get worse. Considering returning."
4,Better than the other mats at the gym,"I just bought this mat a couple weeks ago because my new gym doesn't have any pilates mats. Most people in my class (about 25 ppl) have yoga mats or mats that are marketed as pilates mats but are really too thin. Last night in class, my teacher used my mat as an example of what people should buy if they are just going to take only pilates, and not yoga as well. I never have to add any additional support mats, as the other people in class do, and it's nice that it's so long because I don't have to worry about touching the dirty floor. I am a beginner/intermediate, and I like using it. I only wish it came with a strap or something to help transport it back and forth better!"
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,I used to work at a Pilates studio and they had really squishy comfortable mats. This is not at all like those. It is firm and okay as far as comfort goes but not what I was looking for and now I can't return it because I waited a bit too long to use it. Sucks for me!
5,Great mat!,"Read reviews on this mat before purchasing, and am VERY satisfied. Has made a huge difference in comfort while doing Pilates and stretch-and-flex exercises at local gym. Not smelly at all. Would recommend to anyone. Wish a carrier strap came with it, but I just roll up and put in a duffel bag."
2,Rather flimsy and small,I would agree with the other reviewer who said that they're probably meant for small dogs as these things are about the size of a tissue and not much thicker. Stacking three or four together might achieve some reasonable results but I'm planning to buy something larger and beefier like Simple Solution's Pre-moistened Dog Bathing Cloths ... wish Amazon sold those.
2,Common solutions are good too,"These wipes were ok, but a little expensive for only 25 of them. I found an article from Doberman rescue group that said you can apply Listerine mouthwash to any smelly areas of your dog like stomach and armpits (no private areas of course), when you don't have time or energy to bathe. I tried this and it works very well. Much cheaper."
3,Old school book for the modern age,"From the get go, when you open the first page you can tell this book was written long ago. It is full of good info on the art of Ventriloquism, and handpuppets or stage performance. I think given the age it was written, you must take the jems of knowlege and try and apply them to today as best you can. I did like the brief history on the art, also Edgar Bergin, was the top of his day. His daughter should be proud of him. I think if you can look past the time this was written, you will enjoy the read."
2,"Change the title to ""Bland""","If you want a book written for an eighth grader about ventriloquism here it is. Seek out better, i am sure it is there to be found."
1,Shoddy workmanship,This product is not what I expected. The assembly directions were vague and the materials used were shoddy. The cover is too small for the frame and doesn't keep out blowing snow because of this. The plastic joints are cheap at best and break easily. In my opinion it is a piece of junk.
5,Small Group Ministry the UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST way,"If you are thinking about integrating small group ministry into the life of your congregation, this book is a must have. This volume is a wonderful survey of small group ministry in the Unitarian Universalist Association as of its printing. It describes the many ways congregations ""do"" small groups as well as points out key elements of all groups."
2,I got it for $9 and still think I got ripped off,"I purchased two Dynex Wireless G USB Adapters last night. The purpose was to add my Tivo and newly purchased Xbox 360 to my home network.The Wireless G adapter tested fine on my laptop, so I went and tried it out on Tivo. Tivo doesn't support that kind of adapter. Then I went to my Xbox 360. While the adapter would power up,the system refused to recognize the adapter. Per my conversations with Dynex's tech support, this was my fault exclusively.So the system didn't work for what I needed it to, the tech support staff wasn't helpful, and I now have to return both of these adapters. Overall, I do not recommend this product."
5,listen to it. you'll like it.,"I usually don't like when bands re-invent their songs for live shows, but the versions of ""Crutch"" and ""If You're Gone"" are just beautiful on this cd, I saw them preform live before this came out and the e.p. doesn't quite capture the atmosphere of their live shows, which are very upbeat, but this cd offers a unique view of their music and makes this a staple recording to own for any MatchBox Twenty fan."
3,Rob Thomas Come Back!,"This is a 5 Star CD (regardless of what reviewers are saying) for any M20 fan. The live versions of 'If You're Gone' and 'Push' are wonderful, reinforcing everyone's need to see this band live. I give it 3 Stars because it weighs in at a handful of songs and doesn't do much for the non-fan. The band may as well have put out a full live album instead of something as short as this. The major problem is that it leaves you wanting more and with all of the live cuts on the internet, people are more likely to download something illegally than shell out $10 for an EP. That being said, Rob Thomas needs to shelve the solo career and start putting music together with one of the best bands of the last decade."
4,"Durable, fun, but Velcro too hard to pull apart!","My children both love this stacking toy and spend as much time cuddling it as they do trying to pull it apart/restack it. The problem is the age range listed here (6-18 months) is totally unrealistic. The Velcro attaches so well that my son wasn't able to pull them apart until he was almost 3! So it's a fun toy, but don't expect your 6 month old to be able to separate the pieces without adult assistance.Julie Artz[...]"
2,rivers wash ove me,"stiff dialogue and uneven storyline prevent me from giving this movie a favorable review. it had potential to be a better movie, but was derailed by a choppy pace."
4,A beautifully-written glimpse at life in a convent school.,"I was really surprised by the one-star review. Of course there's a lot of detail about Catholic life. The book is set in the intense, often brutal world of a convent school. Those details, and some very well-drawn characters, make it real. I found Nanda's adjustment to her new life fascinating. A lovely, sad, escapist read."
4,Starts out strong but then slows down,"I found the beginning of this book really absorbing, and I couldn't stop reading it. Antonia White's writing style is fluid and easy to read. But then toward the end of the book, I found myself occasionally losing interest. I would recommend it, however, and I did like it a lot. It's a very interesting portrait of Nanda, who is a very likeable character."
5,wonderful!,"this book was recommended to me a few years ago, and i'm so thankful for the suggestion! i just read it, and what a marvelous book!it tells the story of a young girl who is sent to a catholic school in england in 1908. it's fascinating to read about her conversion and eventual questioning of catholicism. i haven't read such frightening sermons since james joyce's portrait of an artist as a young man.the book is fluid, suspenseful and utterly readable. antonia white's narration is gutwrenchingly believable. the book is the first in series of white's 4 semi-autobiographical novels. i cannot wait to read the others.i strongly suggest you read this book; i think you'll be delighted!"
3,Great writing with little plot,"This book drew me in immediately and promised a very interesting plot. However, towards the middle end, it slowed down and kept talking about the same ideas over and over. I got the point of oppression the first few examples. This would have been forgivable had it not been for such a weak plot. It is a slow and uncertain climax with a very disappointing resolution. The style of writing is very readable, yet not simplistic and boring. For this reason it deserves three stars, but the plot left a lot to be desired. It was rather obvious that this book was quasi-autobiographical. A good read if you don't expect much in the way of story resolution."
1,Did not enjoy it!,I was not thrilled with the book at all. Too much details about Catholics and their ways of life. I wouldn't advise anyone to read it. Maybe if you were a Catholic it might appeal to you.
1,THIS IS NOT A SURFING FILM!,"Jeers to Amazon for having this in the SURFING section! I like the Beach Boys (especially their most overlooked period of 1967-1970), but this is not surfing."
3,A WOMAN IN BELIN,THE MOVIE IS ABOVE AVERAGE BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT WAS IN GERMAN AN RUSSIAN WITH SUB-TITLES BUT THIS FACT WAS NOT EXPLAINED IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE BEFORE PURCHASE.
5,A Woman in Berlin,"Generally a historically accurate portrayal of the ""Rape of Berlin"" in 1945 by the conquering Soviet army, and the trauma suffered by the civilian inhabitants--a story that needed to be told and which must not be forgotten. However, the film contains a couple of story lines that were obviously added for dramatic effect, and that were not part of the anonymous diarist's writings. Also, some portions of the book that could (and perhaps should) have been weaved into the film were ignored or just hinted at, and the timeline seems a bit skewed. It therefore is not 100% accurate, but a powerful, well acted film nonetheless."
4,"Flanel, the next generation","This is a band from Seattle. This is their second record. They mix melodic rock with dark moods. They are often compared to The Jam and Talk Talk. Aveo is actually much closer in spirit to the New York band Natural History. Aveo deals with the subject of science and the weather. In songs like ""Newton and Galileo"" and ""The Idiot On The Bike"" much of this fascination with serious themes is displayed. Their invention in realm of melody and music is fairly fresh and new. They don't just sound like the generic indie bands out there that often copy a style. It is not really a grunge thing. It is a surprising record that abounds in invention. They are much like some punk-punk bands from twenty years ago who often dropped through the cracks. There is hope and eagerness in their mood. It is refreshing. It is like a record you would listen to in the morning on weekends. Maybe they are worth checking out live, to see if they add a further dimension."
5,Quality battery.,"The battery arrived quickly and as described in the ad. I used the battery in a remote control and, so far, no problems with operation. I would order from this company again."
2,Did not get what I ordered,Not only did it take a month to get. It was the wrong battery. I ordered a Sony battery and I got another brand. I could have went to walmart and got a better price
4,Really cool heirloom item,"The description does a pretty good job of telling you what this is. What I'll say about it is that I wish that the hats fit Teddy's head a little bit better (most of them fall over his eyes and make you wonder if they'll stay on) and that the hat rack was sturdier. The hats sort of precariously hang on there.Other than that, very cool item."
1,Terrible Company if You Have a Problem,"Had it for a year and it stopped working. Customer service was USELESS. They recommended that I find a radio repair shop and try to get it fixed. I will never buy another Mr. Christmas product again. For the price that they charge for their products, they should stand behind them."
5,A great item,The ultimate item for grandchildren to watch. It provides countless hours of great entertainment and a reason to go see Grandma and Grandpa.
5,"I love my Teddy Music Box, it is so cute and it sounds really nice. I love to change the hats and hear all the different music.",I am very happy with my Teddy Music Box. It was packaged very well and there were no problems with it when I received it.We put batteries in it right away and it started playing as soon as we put a hat on Teddy's head. So cute!!
1,Broken and Returned,Purchased item for Christmas.Item did not work out of the box.Loud scratching noises when it played or it would not play at all. It certainly looked like an entertaining piece. I'm sorry that you did not have another available to replace the broken one.Thank you for crediting my account after returning the item.
1,might as well just have a fan,warning! this product really sucks.we have a fan that cools the room better than this device. it's really not that effective.my mother in law has a really cheap air cooler you just stick ice into a smaller device and it's much better. i'm gonna find out what she got and get her device.this one though is very bad. don't waste your time and money.
1,Really expensive fan,"Bought this to cool down my baby's bedroom at night. We live in Denver, CO which has low humidity, so in theory, adding cold moisture should drop the room temp. It didn't. I can't explain why, I did run it for 1.5 hours and nothing! Except for a plastic-like smell that is. This is by far the worst product I have ever bought as it cost me $28 to ship out and will probably cost like $40 ship back. So I am out $68."
4,Ice it,"Good product, easy to use. Don't expect to cool your full room, but if you put a bag of ice in the water well, along with some water, the air coming out from it is nice and cold. Oscillate the fan, and the whole family gets a cool breeze. Good product for a good price. Mobile friendly."
1,not cool,"Not worth the money I paid for. Doesnt reall y cool off the room and to me, it does not clean the air."
2,Doesn't really cool the air that much,"The unit itself seems well built and the fan is quite, however, it doesn't really cool the air very much even when using the ice packs (included in the product) or adding ice to the water. Since I've used evaporative coolers before, I believe the problem is in the design. The mesh for the water to drip through isn't thick enough and too porous to cool the air that is being pulled through it. Also, there are open airways on the side of the mesh of significant size that allow the air to bypass the cooling mesh altogether. If these were blocked and directed all the airflow through a thicker mesh I think this would cool the air a lot better. Bummer is that a week after I received the product, I found a cooler made from Ikea that was cheaper and much more efficient at cooling. I decided not to return mine because the shipping costs alone would be to much. Overall, the unit works, but not much better then a conventional fan."
3,This is not an air conditioner,"If you are looking for a portable air conditioner that does not need to be vented to the outdoors...I don't know that there IS such a thing, but this is not it. This is a very well made fan that uses water and/or ice to attempt to cool the air coming out of it. If you have it blowing directly on you, I do believe the air feels cooler than a traditional fan. However, I initially placed this unit in a very small room (8'x8'), filled it with ice and water, and placed it on oscillate with the hope that I would come back to find the room cooler. It was not the least bit cooler (wish I had a thermometer so that I could prove it). Still, when you have the unit blowing on you it does seem cooler...better than just a fan. So, it's not perfect but can give a bit of relief. As other reviewers have mentioned, the poorly translated directions are very difficult to decipher but thankfully there are several clear diagrams showing set-up and operation."
2,OK...but not that great,"I live in Washington state in an area where the humidity is about 45-50%. Therefore a evaporative cooler should work great. WELL...the instructions are fun to read, seriously they arent exactly useful but good for a laugh.PROS: Fan works great. I like the timer/sleep features its not extremly noisyCONS: doesnt cool very much even with ice in the water(that i kept in the fridge) and in the upper comparment i think this is because the mesh is uses is very much like that of a laundry bag not thick enough to absorb much water. The indicator lights are bright enough to be a night lite.Overall, if you want a fan with a bit of humidity this is your thing. If you want something to actually cool a room or space of any kind. You should get an air conditioner."
2,not a great cooler,"I had high hopes for this little evaporative cooler, but it doesn't cool that much. It is easy to use and easy to move from room to room. I live in a very dry climate, so having a little more humidity in the air makes it a little more comfortable. The fan works great, which also makes it feel more comfortable, but it is not very effective at acutally lowering the room temperature (not even a degree in a small living room)."
3,well built,Item is well built and rugged and easy to use. It doesn't have significant cooling effect even in dry california but probably true of all similar swamp coolers.
5,Life on the Run,"This film gives us a view of Russian life that we've heard about. But we couldn't comprehend the impact it would have on it's citizens, especially the vulnerable ones.The boy was abandoned by his mother and he sets out to find his father in the gulag system somewhere out in the remote region of Russia. His encounters within the juvenile system, the police while on the run, and the citizens he meets during his trip truly drips of Russian soul. Once he finds his father, he learns about his father's life as a child and how he landed in the adult prison system.Purchase this movie along with 'Lessons at the End of Spring' and 'Greenhouse Effect'. You'll get the full breath of Russian life during the Berlin Wall era."
4,All Music Guide Review,"Bexar Bexar's debut album on Western Vinyl is 15 songs of instrumental ambience and gentleness, open and clear and delivered well. Reminding the listener of the finer moments from such artists as Mum and Tortoise, the songs flow together so smoothly that the album is over before you realize it. Bexar Bexar can definitely pull the senses in, evoking memories of sunny autumn afternoons or lazy Sunday mornings snuggled underneath layers of warm blankets. The music is composed of mild electronic sounds, mellow guitar tones, upbeat loops, and a good deal of ambience is noted on Haralambos, as well. And whether feelings generated from the songs are akin to the stark melancholy of looking upon a freshly fallen snow or the hopeful joy of waking to a fresh autumn day, this is one hell of a great album. &#65533; Kurt Morris (AMG)"
2,piece of toy,"I'm very dissapointed with this keyboard. It looks like a big piece of toy. The keyboard looks like it's made of cheap plastic. The owners manual consists of a few pages of photocopied papers stapled together. It doesn't have an address, phone number or warranty information. The sound quality is ok, but it dissapears after 2 seconds even leaving the keys pressed. I will definitely not recommend this keyboard to anyone. I rather pay extra $50 to $100 for a name brand item. I guess you get what you pay for. I just hope it won't break soon."
1,DO NOT Waste Your Money,This keyboard is very poor quality. It rattled when moved as if there was a broken piece inside. It only worked on batteries. The power cord did not work. There were no instructions included. Customer service was very polite and quick to respond to complaint which is why I give 2 stars rather than one. Do not order. If you return product even with defects you must pay for return shipping yourself. The product is worth $5 at most.
3,*****WARNING*****,"This keyboard is excellent value for money, but BEWARE::: The power unit being supplied by Austin Bazaar is incorrect and WILL RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE UNIT.Check that a 9V power unit is supplied and NOT the 12V unit. The latter unit will cause the keyboard to overheat and eventually burn out, rendering your money lost."
1,Horrible Sham of a Product,"This product is horrible - complete crime that they're selling this. The quality of the sound is absolutely horrific - that is, if you can get sound. i owned this keyboard for a month before it stopped turning on - plugged in or with battery, the keyboard will not turn on, and there is no information for servicing this product. so buyers beware!"
2,Dissappointed,My keyboard buzzes anytime I turn it on and none of the instruments sound even remotely similar to how they do in real life. The keyboard itself seems to have been cheaply made as the battery compartment broke as soon as I pulled it out of the box. Operating the different settings is confusing even after reading the sadly uninformative information packet. I would not recommend this instrument to anyone above a beginner level unless it is only as a temporary thing or you have another piano to fall back on.
5,Awesome Deal!!!,"I bought this keyboard a few weeks ago, and I am really impressed w/all the features it has! I think that 61 Keys is perfect for a beginner like me. The things that impressed me the most were the cool demo songs and the rhythm programming..and of course the price :) This keyboard is great for jam sessions to see if you've got what it takes to become a cool keyboardist! I highly recomment it."
3,Great Book ... Quizzes aren't quite right!,"Overall the content of the book is simple and easy to read. I thought it allowed you to do some great self reflecting. However the quizzes don't seem quite accurate. Example: I am 50 years old I consider myself highly extroverted yet when answering questions about extroversion the score is negative if I don't like going to clubs or enjoy loud parties. I love parties why do they have to be loud? When it comes to materialism one of the questions is ""Do you dream of winning the lottery? Heck no ... however I work extremely hard and am driven financially to succeed, since when did winning the lottery become a viable pathway to success? Questions need to be updated ... otherwise good info!"
5,A great remote,We are really happy with this remote. It works perfectly with Star Choice. It has been reliable and tough (we have several small children). It was the cheapest yet best universal remote we have purchased yet.
3,Good remote....until it breaks,"I went through about 3 of these in a year and a half. These are cheap and work pretty well, but they don't last very long."
1,AMAZON STAFF: CHECK YOUR SPELLING,"THE WORD ""SHERBET"" IS CORRECTLY SPELLED AS SUCH, WITH ONLY ONE ""R"". WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES MISSPELL THAT WORD AS ""SHERBERT""? I FIND IT REALLY ANNOYING, AND ANOTHER ONE IS ""MISCHIEVOUS"", WHICH HAS ONLY THREE (3) SYLLABLES. IT IS NOT, AND NEVER HAS BEEN, PRONOUNCED ""MISS-CHEE-VEE-USS"", I.E. WITH FOUR SYLLABLES. WHO IS TEACHING OUR CHILDREN HOW TO SPELL AND PRONOUNCE WORDS NOWADAYS? ANYBODY HOME?"
2,Yukky movie,"I am really glad I did not waste a theater ticket for this movie. I am sorry that I actually paid for a movie that will never be watched again at my home.I did not like the language...the drunkeness...the ""greaser"" disgusting life style of the main character. Even though the movie ended in a positive manner...I thought it was a waste of time. We kept thinking it would get better but it never did. Neither my husband or myself liked the movie."
1,Disappointed,"This dvd movie was completely defective ; kept freezing up while my wife and I tried to watch it ; a complete waste of money ; if I do not receive any restitution , I will probably never by another dvd from Amazon.com"
1,defective,"0 stars ~ I ordered this movie and it would not PLAY.You could see behind the scenes and extras, but it would not do anything when you hit play. Amazon sent out another one and it did the same thing. Defective movie."
3,Mumbling towards ecstasy,Be prepared to either keep the subtitles on or crank the volume to 50 as Bad Blake requires frequent translation and or amplification. Bridges is indeed fantastic as Bad though unfortunately this is not good enough to rescue a self-consciously-formulaic product that believes itself to be compelling art. There are some honest notes--a couple good songs though several of them have hooks too close to well-known hits. If you're in the mood for a down and almost out former star against the odds movie then I must give the edge to 'The Wrestler'.And with zero special features it's a bit hard to recommend anything other than a rental or borrow.
4,Life's second chances,"There are plenty of movies about performers, boxers and wrestlers with a shot of second chances in their broekn careers and personal lifes. For that reason, this movie is not any different from many we have seen before. However, it is Jeff Bridges' performance that makes all the difference here. He is rugged looking Texan country music performer who has seen better days. His life is spiraling down and in his loneliness and hopelessness he is finding some solace in drink and endless travels from one part of the country to the other.During one of his stints in New Mexico, he falls for a young woman with a child. He finally feels he has another chance at life, until he makes a fatal mistake. The sincerity of emotion with which this character copes with his situation is what makes this a powerful film. Although I am no fan of country music, I actually enjoyed listening to performances in this film."
5,Good Experience,This movie was received on time and in excellant condition.The movie had lots of profanity and I am not into that. The bottom line of the movie was good. I only wish these good movies would not include the use of profanity.
4,Jeff Bridges is an Excellent Actor,"Hard living, hard drinking and then touchingly sober. This movie represents a musician with warmth and humour and I believe it can speak to many of us."
2,Pretty boring,"This movie isn't about some tortured deep soul who has had a hard life. It's about an old washed up country music singer who reaches the end of his rope and gets sober. Like a damn lightswitch I might add. He just goes to an AA meeting and comes right out feeling like new! It's bland and there is little conflict. Bridges has great talent and brings humor to the role. The old, fat, Texas drunk has a few good lines. You can miss it."
2,not believable - it lost my attention early on,"It's just not credible that the the young, attractive, intelligent and somewhat together female lead would fall for the male lead who is fat, old and perpetually drunk. And I say this in sharing at least two of the characteristics of the male lead. The only believable part was that she dumped him and then stuck to her guns even after he sobered up. The music was so-so and it goes to help prove that just about any celebrity can make a mark in the realm of country music, especially by trying to sing and act like a C&W performer in a major motion picture."
2,No thank you!!!,I only kept watching this because of the AA it received. While I watched it I was surfing the web and I didn't feel I was missing out. It's a so so tale but I can't really recommend it. MY GRADE: D plus to C minus.
1,Crazy should be right title for this movie,"I am sorry I have better use of my time than to watch a movie about aAlcoholic and abuser of women. The main player in the movie aka Bad Blake admitted he was married 5 times huh what a loser he is then we get this so called sweet and nice girl Friend who wants to get to know him better and is doing a so called story on him and next thing you know they are in bed together plus she want to bring home to meet her 4 yr old son huh. Wow now that is a great role model to have around huh ? After 40 mins of this I shut it down and boxed movie up and I may even give it away or resell it here. The acting was not very good , plots been done before and lead actor Jeff aka Bad Blake keeps mumbling and drinking and womanizing. Like I said there is better movies to watch than this one."
3,Crazy What,"Was okay, nothing new,sad to see such a great actor playing such a wasted role... story has be around/rehashed a million times before.."
3,Crazy Heart,"It was a good movie, not a great one. Jeff Bridges portrayed a great, down and out drunk. But the plot was not very new. Been there, done that. No twists or turns, ends the way I expected; happy and predictable. But the country music was very good and original."
5,CRAZY HEART,This is a really great DVD movie. This movie may one day be a classic. Jeff Bridges was outstanding! This is well worth you buying!
4,Well Scripted & Acted Movie,"I thought the movie's script was excellent as well as the performances by the actors, Jeff Bridges did an exceptional job."
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE,"WHY IS THIS MOVIE EVEN A MOVIE IS BEYOND ME. TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY OR RENT!!!"
5,Great Depth,"Film is a great character study of redemption that strikes me as real and unflinching. It's a view into the cost of fame and integrity or the attempts one takes to live within their failings. There are some weak moments probably because of time/budget or marketing needs, especially the ending wrap-up. The music was delightfully high quality and story appropriate making a complete experience."
2,Recycled Tender Mercies Theme,"It kinda of surprised me that this thing would track so closely to Tender Mercies. It's not as claustrophobic as Tender Mercies, the little romance moves across the southwest, has a few deviations but the theme of a redeemed broken down CW singer is identical for all practical purposes. Since he was one pf the producers Robert Duvall gave himself a small part in case anyone wasn't clued in to the relation with Tender Mercies.I just can't figure out who this movie would appeal to. Its dull predictable plot plods along; Maggie Gyllenhaal as the female lead registers an infomercial caliber performance and Jeff bridges plays, well, Jeff Bridges which again leaves me scratching my head as to why he got an Oscar for this non-notable, unoriginal film.Weird."
2,"""The Wrestler"" countryfied","Same premise as The Wrestler- washed up, former addicted ridden star, cleans himself up (sorta), gets back into the game (sorta). Slow moving and predictable. If you wish to watch original movies with original stories, stick to any movie made before 1987. The 30s, 40s, and 50s, having the best, most interesting story line with character."
2,Stinker!!,"Ugh!! Another flick I couldn't wait to see but was utterly disappointed after watching. I'll quote my wife..""...I'm gonna vomit if that young pretty reporter falls for the 20 years her senior run-down, alcoholic, overweight, dried vomit in his goatee, country singer"". And sure enough she did. IMO they had zero chemistry and it was just totally unbelievable. On top of that the movie was incredibly slow. I added a star for the great movie soundtrack and for Jeff Bridges great acting..."
3,Crazy Heart,I didn't care for this movie too much. I need to quit buying movies that I think will be good just because they win an award or because I like the actor. It was a little slow....a lot of drinking..and I just didn't care for it too much.
1,Drunken fool,"Although he is a good actor, the plot is weakened from an artist true love...his bottle and music with poor choices in life's lessons"
4,Good Picture....Jeff Bridges should get an award for this performance!,Crazy Heart is a very good movie...Jeff Bridges becomes an over the hill country singer and does an outstanding job!
3,Bridges Is Strong,"Jeff Bridges won a long overdue Oscar for Best Actor in Crazy Heart. While Mr. Bridges is excellent as a down and out country singer Bad Blake who hits the booze too hard and has been reduced to playing gigs in bowling alleys and small bars throughout the southwest. Along the way, he meets a reporter, Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal) with whom he has a relationship with and meets up with his former protégé, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), who is a huge star and helps Bad get back into the big time. While all the performances are strong, the story feels likes it been told many times before. It bears an especially strong resemblance to one of the movie's co-stars Robert Duvall's Tender Mercies. That being said, this film is well worth watching for Mr. Bridges tour-de-force acting and not to be overlooked, Ms. Gyllenhaal's work that received a well deserved Best Supporting Actress nomination."
4,Great movie,"I bought this Movie for my Dad because I loved it so much and knew he would enjoy it as well. The story was awesome and the Music & Message moving. I was super stoked that I recieved the digital copy free , now I can watch it anytime anywhere"
2,Not a very good movie,"I was expecting more, but the acting was great.The story line was a little worn out."
4,Does not cut tape very well,It is very hard to get the tape dispenser teeth to cut the tape. It is sturdy and doesn't slide around. Good weight.
5,Tape Dispenser,This is a tape dispenser. Not much more to say about this item. It holds the tape in place so I can tear off a piece when it is needed.
1,Be careful IF you order !,"I followed the instructions exactly for measuring my dog as stated on the site. I ordered this collar to match a Premier tracking harness. The collar I received was entirely too large and could not be adjusted enough to fit. Since the shipping charges were more than the merchandise, I will not return it since I would have to pay a 15% re-stocking fee and an additional charge to return it. I will give it to someone with a much, much larger dog. Just wasted $9.72 and still don't have a collar."
4,Not that easy to fold and unfold.,I bought the Zport for my sailboat. Perfect in size and weight. Rides nicely. Only complaint: to fold and unfold is a little difficult. Great value.
1,poor service,"I waited forever for this little battery. Nothing is wrong with the battery itself but ten days after purchase, having not received it, I made contact with the vendor. They told me it was out of stock and didn't know when a new shipment would be in. I asked why had it not been posted as 'out of stock'? all they could do was apologize and say it would be on its way. Sure. It took another two weeks. Poor service. Would have purchased it somewhere else had I known it was out of stock."
1,Flash broke after a couple of month,"Excited to get this camera at X'mas 2002. I thought my settings were wrong, not considering it is broken after just a couple of month because of my confidence with Sony for its reputation. I didn't use often hence I didn't have a chance to realize that flash is actually broken.It is now after 90-day warranty, and more than half the price is for repair. I could buy other low-end brand new digital camera with working flash. When I called Servie Center, same set of questions from three Service representatives, and finally determined it is broken. During the conversation, I was asked to plug into AC Power to isolate the problem....?!It now is a good ""daytime only"" camera."
5,I love my Sony DSC-P31 Cybershot,"I recently purchased this camera through Amazon and I absolutely LOVE it. I am a student and literally have no money. So, being able to make a second-hand purchase saved me a lot of money and I have been having a lot of fun with it. It's so small that I can literally take it everywhere with me.In terms of battery use, the first thing I did was to purchase an additional 4 rechargibles and a battery charger that charges in less than 4 hours. So far, I have had to change them once in the last 3-4 weeks.For the entry-level, cost-concious photographer, this is the one. I anticipate not having to upgrade until I graduate."
4,Sony: A Really Great Camera!,"This Sony digital camera is a really good camera! It is really small, so it can fit in my purse or pocket, but it takes really good quality pictures and movies. It is also a great buy compared to other cameras in its price range.The only drawback to this camera is it does not come with a camera carrier. I believe if we are spending this much money, Sony should at least extend the courtesy of including a camera case so we do not damage our camera. Also, the batteries wear out really fast even when I do not turn on the camera for long amounts of time.Sony is a great brand and that is the only brand of electronics I ever buy; this is one of their really good products!"
3,Do not buy this Camera if you do not have 1 GB memory stick,Consumes lot of memory. [900k/ picture]Takes good picture in Dim night light but worst pictures in day bright light..Think twice before buying it.....
4,Great for backyard practice,My 10 year old is in his second year of football and this pad is very helpful for me to help review what he did in practice
4,There are no cheap eats in Waikiki,"This book had some wonderful information about how to get cheap food in Hawaii. The only thing is that there is no such thing as ""cheap food"" in Waikiki. You have to drive out of Waikiki if you wanted cheap food. (Better yet, get a suite with a kitchen and cook your own dinner.) Breakfast is the cheapest meal in Waikiki."
4,Holy Bible with the Apocrypha,"The New Revised Standard version offers an accurate, while easy to read & understand translation. The Apocryphal books are in the center of the book and offer interesting stories from the lives of characters in biblical times. One thing I especially like is the size of this bible. It is small enough to fit comfortably in your hands. The print is small, but not difficult to read. The weight of the pages is good, not flimsy tissue paper. The black imitation leather cover is attractive and durable. This bible is a good value."
5,"Compact, inexpensive, and easy-to-read",This is a great version of the Bible and it is very compact and easy-to-read. I took a copy of this Bible on a recent trip and found that it was the perfect size for traveling. Smaller versions would tend to be much more difficult to read.
4,The Nrsv Bible Cross Reference Edition with Apocrypha,This Bible has many good features in it. I needed it for a class in school and it worked just fine.
1,Golf Shoes,I would be glad to review this shoe but I ordered these shoes a month ago and I still have not recieved them. Oh buy the way Amazon charged my credit card and has received payment for them. Go figure
1,Does not work,"This heart rate monitor only takes the correct heart rate when one is sitting down doing nothing. It did not read the heart rate while I was working out. Most of the times I attempted to get it to read my heart rate while working out it could not read it, even though I followed the trouble shooting directions and even though I stopped my work out and tried to get a reading that way. Twice it did ""read"" my heart rate, giving me initially a heart rate of 59--below my resting heart rate--and then a heart rate of 219. Testing my heart rate manually at the same time showed a heart rate of about 155, so both of the mio readings were off. Since it can't calculate your burned calories unless it can read your heart rate, the calories burned function is totally useless. I am returning this product."
1,not here,"I ordered this product on nov. 30, but have yet to recieve it. Amazon has never failed me before, but I am disappointed that I have not gotten this watch yet. I suspect that is has something to do with choosing the super-shipping option."
2,Mio Shape Select Petite a little too complicated,This watch was too complicated for my taste. You have to remember a series of steps to calculate your heart rate and the instruction book is not very helpful. I also question the accuracy of the monitor since it had my heart rate at over 300 after a 30 minute workout on the eliptical. I wouldn't buy the watch again.
3,"Great basics, but the extra features too much of a hassle","The main reason I purchased this watch was to have something to monitor my heart rate while I exercised, without bothering with a chest strap. This watch definitely lets me do that, although I occasionally have to try repeatedly before getting a reading.However, most of the extra features are far too awkward and time consuming to be worth using for me -- the modes for tracking calories consumed and burned just take more effort than they are worth for my lifestyle.And even though this is the 'petite' model, it was simply too bulky to feel comfortable on my wrist.That said, it is by far the most convenient way I've found of monitoring my heart rate while exercising, and so I'm glad to have it. If I was going to purchase one of these again, though, I'd probably go for one of the simpler, less expensive models."
3,Baseline Workout Tracker,"I was disappointed to find out that while the heart rate monitor doesn't require a telemetry strap, it doesn't ""monitor"" your heart rate. You have to take your pulse by holding down two buttons. Also, it almost never can get a read on my heart rate, if I try to take it while running. I guess I move too much for it to register. However, this is better than nothing."
1,quantity misrepresented?,"I was disappointed when I rec'd these batteries because the image posted to Amazon is a package of TWO batteries per package, I ordered two (thinking I was ordering 4 batteries) and only two SINGLE pack batteries arrived.NO answer from customer service. I'm not going to lose my shirt over this purchase, but honest representation of the products and customer feedback are two of the reason I shop on Amazon"
1,Pretty Gross,"""New car smell"" does not smell like a new car. I don't really know what this air freshener smells like, but it's not a new car. It smelled worse than the smell I was trying to eliminate from my car.I would suggest getting the original scent and a can of glade lavender and vanilla, these two sprays together will eliminate the smell you're trying to get out of the air, and leave behind a clean spring time scent."
1,Ozium should be banned!,"Ozium ""New Car Scent"" freshener should be banned from the market. I'm dissapointed in Amazon as I got no response back about returning this product. The shipping company was ""The Auto Alley"", probably one of the worst companies I tried to deal with. The product burned my eyes and made me sick. I got no response back from anybody."
2,Don't Buy it,"This is not even close to new car smell at all, don't waste your money. You're much better off with those Yankee Candles, and they're cheaper."
2,A bit disappointed,"While I like the glass panels, I am disappointed the items do not have Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Glasgow printed on them as it appears in the digital image."
4,Good Beginner's Resource,"Book was more than I had hoped for! I was looking for something to provide an overview of creating a website, and included some info on FrontPage.What I got was a book that had all that .. and more. The cd-rom includes lots of practice materials, demonstrations and even quizzes to check your progress.I haven't gotten through all of it yet, but it looks like a promising resource to have handy!"
5,LML does it again,"Once again, I am impressed by an album from LML music. The selection of songs was varied and pulled from a wide range of sources, from Natalie Merchant (the gorgeous Verdi Cries) to a Donna Summer song (my least favourite song on the album, There Will Always Be A You) to a more typical cabaret number (David Friedman's We Live on Borrowed Time).Joanne O'Brien's perfomance of the material is wonderful. Her version of Southbound Train is touching, catching all the sadness of the song, without overplaying any of it. She also has fun with a song like I Only Want to Be With You. A very satifying album and I look forward to hearing more from Ms. O'Brien."
1,Beware,"This book should be purchased by music readers only -- not tablature readers. Of all the songs listed, only Stairway contains both music and tablature.Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,Many parts omitted,"This book is probably geared towards a beginner. It condenses the layers of Page's guitars into one guitar. That means a lot is let out of this book. Pretty much all of the solos are left out. I ended up getting the Classic Led Zeppelin I-V Box Set, which is very detailed. I would only recommend this book to a beginner."
1,waste of your money,"don't buy this peice of junk, its a waste of trees and your money. the tabs are all wrong, half of the music isn't there, and it was written like the guy tabbing it had to leave in 5 minutes. the worst thing is that is only puts selective parts of a song in there like, for example, black dog has the intro and the chorus but as for the solo......nowhere to be found. and here's the entire tab for 'when the levee breaks'---low E---3-0-3-0-3-0this is the worst tab book ever printed and is a disgrace to led zeppelin."
2,Not Very Good... Only For Beginners,"I got this book when I was a beginner and I thought it was great. The songs looked so easy to play. One of my favorite songs, When The Levee Breaks, had only 3 notes in it (according to the book). I took it to my guitar teacher and every song I wanted to learn was wrong except for stairway to heaven. None of the solo's are in the book and many of the songs are tabbed so easily that they are wrong. It says that this book is for beginners and it is. If you are half-way descent at the guitar, don't buy this book."
1,Dumbed Down.,"Yeah, don't buy this book unless you can't play the guitar. If you have any sort of skill with the instrument you will be bored with the holes they leave in trascribing the songs. There's not a single solo (who wants Led Zeppelin without the guitar solos). In fact, instead of 3 stars I'm giving it 1, because you could find better tabs online for free."
1,They Are Still Printing This POS?,"I bought this book in the 1970's and then found out afterward that it was notorious for egregious transcription errors. And, like an earlier comment said, this is not a tab book, so you would have to be an excellent sight reader to use it. Do yourself a favor and take a pass. There are far better Zep books out there, thankfully."
1,The Hindenburg of a book,"Totally lame. These tabs suck. The chord progression for Over the Hills and Far away is not even right.The arpeggios for Going to California are totally without any of the embellishments. I got a better tab on the internet....Get the Alfred series, don't bother with this one.And don't buy this at guitar center, they suck and had to point out they won't return books before I bought it. That should have been a red flag..."
3,NIA not my cup of tea,"It's a good DVD for learning the range and philosophy of NIA exercise. But I understand myself to prefer a structured approach (for example: a dvd with three modules - one for upper body, one for lower body, one for core). While this was pleasing to watch, I really couldn't get into allowing myself to exercise this way. Back to my structured DVD collection, and long bike rides in any weather."
3,"Funny, but very short","As with the rest of his material, it is quite humorous. However, the CD is by far his shortest in length, coming in at barely half an hour. Not nearly as good as his older material."
3,"Funny stuff, just needs MORE of it.","The songs (other than the first one) are just rehash of previous material, although the Christmas one is pretty good.As far as the rest of it goes, it was really good. Funny stuff. The Married Twenty Years bit was spot-on. As Homer Simpson would say ""It's funny because it's true"". In Vitro and Boys Have No Discretion are the cream of the crop for this one.Not as good as Dorkfish and Awesome, mostly because of the lack of content. It's only slightly over 20 minutes of new material.If you like Bill, it'll probably be a good buy for you."
2,Reloaded - More Like Recycled,"I am a big Bill Engvall fan. I would love to give a good review, but for this CD, I just can't. What's up with the recycled material??? And it is so short, I am wondering if this is just a record label obligation effort. There is some funny material, sure. But you'd expect that from Bill; he's a real good standup comic. It's the recycled material and extremely short length that make me pan it. Sorry, folks, but don't waste your money."
3,Your sign reloaded,Too much like his first album. A lot of the jokes from the first album were again a part of his second album.
4,Bill Reloaded,"If you like Bill Engvall, then you'll like this. It's not his best, but it's still good."
1,Not recommended!,"I got through most of this book before giving up. My 30-second review: Having a Ph.D. might get you a book contract, but it sure doesn't make you any of the following: rigorous, searching, expert, or wise. There's no command of the youth development lit here; there's no comprehensive understanding of the lives of young people today; and there are few sentences and paragraphs that don't beg for good editing! What's here? Generalities and platitudes abundant. Don't waste your time as I did. There are many better books out there!"
1,Cruel and Bizarre ...,"I had to stop reading after 56 pages. I fail to see the humor in the author's ineptness at trying to run a small farm (?) in New York in the 70s ~ especially since it is the poor animals that have to deal with the poor treatment. The dog has to stay outside because it sheds? Yikes. Also, certainly this couple wasn't going to starve, so the buthering of their pig, a young calf and the deaths of various other animals seemed so cruel and needless. Was I supposed to laugh when the butcher neighbor spouted being born again while the poor pig was disemboweled? Ugh. Not sure what this is supposed to say about kindness to living beings (it's okay to butcher if the pig is given a nice place to live first?) country living or family values as they obviously hid their young son from these realities. This is going in the recycling bin. The thought that this could end up in someone's hands who might find what the author did a good idea will give me nightmares."
5,Small but powerful,"I bought my Bescherelle for my college French class, originally I bought the French version because it was cheaper than the others, but I soon realized it was better than the others. The book is half the size of the English Bescherelle and MUCH more compact, useful, and easier to use than other verb dictionaries such as 500 French Verbs. Sure the text is in French, but the text other than the verbs isn't important, and you will only need to know the name of the tenses in French to find it in this great little organized book."
1,Disappointing,"Having used travel guides by the publisher in the past, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the sections regarding travel advice and tips only encompassed pp. 1-63 and most of the tips were most basic common-sense advice. More egregiously, I would caution against the new age health tips on pp. 55-57 for children (without identifying the appropriate ages) and which seem dangerous in any event. It was this section which prompted me to toss down the book. The remainder, pp. 65-262, consists of extremely general ""to do""s in various parts of the world, For example, some countries/regions were covered and others not, with little rhyme or reason. The information provided was too general to be useful and too much of a rush to cover different regions to really provide any comprehensive suggestions or guidance. Having bought the book on the strengh of the Lonely Planet reputation, I was very disappointed."
1,DISAPPOINTING CHAFF,"I had high hopes. But this book does not deliver. First, it's a kind-of guide for parents traveling with VERY young children. Second, it offers only the most basic common-sense advice: ""Don't drink the tap water in India"" kind of thing. There is a book to be written on this subject but this is not it."
3,good supplement,"If you have never traveled with your baby or kids before, I would recommend a different book that contains more ""advice,"" like Lutz's On the Go with Baby.If you are going to travel extensively with your kids, this is a nice book to have in your travel library. It does not get too specific about individual places, but then again it does have some interesting specifics you may not find in other books. The first-hand accounts are great. It is rather short, but it does have some good advice and anecdotes pertaining to travel in out-of-the-way places. I was disappointed it does not refer to the extent English is spoken in various foreign countries. However, if you are a little adventurous and are thinking about planning a trip with kids-in-tow, but don't know exactly where you want to go, this is a good book to use in the decision making process."
4,First hand perspective on international travel with small children,"So far i am enjoying the insights this book offers into the experience of travelling abroad with little kids; the playgrounds in paris, the lack of diapers in india, etc... I hope to get lots out of it and mainly to calm some of my fears so that i can bravely go where moms and dads have gone before."
1,Waste money and Cisco is not the old cisco any more,"As a networking expert for over 15 years experience and 10 years cisco network products. Ordered this because it's a product from cisco and I always trusted them for best value for the business. However Cisco this time failed me big time. Initial configuration was quick and everything working, saved the configuration and reboot to test it again. then weird thing happened, the same configuration didnt' work. First time I thought it's the configuration problem and I tried another time. The second time happened exaclty the same as first time. working for initial setup and not working for reboot startup. Even I backup the configuation and restore the configuration, no luck. Don't waste money and ernengy unless you are consultant charging per hour."
3,Seductive enough,"Despite the inferior sound recording, this indie rock group manages to weave semi-hypnotic melodies around a churning aesthetic, effectively sucking willing listeners inside these lengthy repetitions, sometimes in a more positive bent then previously explored. At times momentum subsides and the sludgy, repetitious production begins sounding like an extended modern Breeders album, but there are enough noisily beautiful and intelligently crafted moments, like the Mogwai-esque closer, to heartily recommend the good parts."
5,A gripping account of a cruel episode of American history,"The latest in the Look West series, The Navajo Long Walk is a brief book that uses plain terms and full-color photographs throughout to tell the story of when, during the course of the Civil War, the U.S. military decided to force the Navajo people to move from their traditional homelands to a tiny reservation in New Mexico. For four harsh years the Navajo struggled to survive in their new home; starvation, dysentery, and dehydration was widespread. According to modern estimates, nearly a fifth of the Navajo population at the time perished either en route or at the camp. At last the survivors were permitted to return home, and in a twist of irony, the Long Walk ultimately cemented connections and helped preserve tribal identity rather than destroy it. A gripping and sober account of a cruel episode of American history."
5,Great Show,"The beginning of a wonderful series from ITV, although I must admit buying mine from the UK site and playing on my all region DVD player. This DVD does not include closed caption but you can change the settings on your TV to Closed Caption which seems to work well for me."
1,"Quality, please!","I'm giving this new set a conditional one-star review until I know whether the episodes have been upgraded in quality. If they have been redone to provide excellent picture clarity, vibrant color, and sound, then, having seen these episodes on the old muddy discs, these discs will rate a five-star review! These are excellent performances by all involved and well worth owning! I did not purchase any of the old sets, including the complete Morse, because of the poor quality of the discs, but if these are the badly needed improved discs, they'll be in my Cart right away!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this camera and was disappointed. I found it took good pictures indoors using the built-in flash. However, the outdoor shots were very disappointing; the details in the photos were not clear at all. After a week or so of experimenting, I returned the camera."
5,The real Story,Herb Wagner has written a book that will become a classic. Whata good story. And his conclusions will amaze you. The pioneer days of motorcycling in America are brought to life with exquisite detail. Never seen before photgraphs. A must read forany motorcycle enthusiast.
5,An indepth analysis of the beginnings of Harley-Davidson,"The author, Herb Wagner, details through an indepth analysis of his extensive findings from his thorough research of the beginnings of the Harley-Davidson Motor Company. This book is an outstanding perspective of motorcycle history."
5,Warm & Rich,"""All That God said"" is one of the best gospel cuts I've ever played. A must have, if you love good soulful gospel music."
5,Modern Southern Soul at its best.,"If you are disappointed or turned off by today's R&B (or, more accurately, the crap that passes for R&B on Urban radio!), you really should check this CD out. Omar Cunningham and his producers are to be commended for releasing such a high-quality Southern Soul CD. Despite having been issued in 2003, this classic album has far more in common with the classic Blues and Soul albums that Johnnie Taylor, William Bell and Little Milton cut for Stax in the early 1970s than with today's tune-less and meaningless R&B that comes from the major labels. Grade:A++."
5,Phenomenal...a seminal CD for indie lovers!,"This has been a staple in my CD case for years now. This man had a true gift for expression through music, and his debilitating health makes this music all the more valuable for its rarity. The cover of ""But Beautiful"" is one of the most solid pieces of music I've listened to in some time, with a faithful yet emotional interpretation of a classic. The rest of the album is strong and the lyrics are rarely contrived or forced. The entire disc is a wonderful thing to behold. If you enjoy independent music and great jazz music, you owe it to yourself to put this music in your collection!"
5,HP C9354BN 94/95 Black/Tricolor Ink Carttridge Combo Pack (2 Pack),very good seller to deal with. Very reasonable product when purchased in a two pack.
5,movie,wonderful & funny. can make a MST3K out of anyone. great fun wish it was still on tv great watching
2,Not MST3K's Best Work,"Amazon's Instant Video glitches. This failed television series (read: feature length production) is one of worst MST3K shows, so I am not even going to bother watching Master Ninjas II. It's no surprise that the production is bad, but it is so bad as to be unredeemable by Joel and the robots. Some occasional one-liners, but not enough to make this one worthwhile. Check outMystery Science Theater 3000: Future Warinstead."
3,Sourcebook Series,"Well, it was not what I expected, so I was a little disappointed. Nothing negative, mind you, just not my cup of tea and was not what I needed as far as a resource I could go to often:)"
2,disappointing,"This booked seemed so full of promise, since it contains all kinds of information on a variety of things. Once I started reading the book, though, it was like reading one short story after another. Most of the information in the book can easily be found on the Internet or in other books. She touches very briefly on the topics presented in the book. By the time I was done with the book, I didn't feel I gained any knowledge. Some of the things in the book were very stereotypical portrayals and insulting. It's a good coffee table book, but by no means the best book on spells, ceremonies, and magic."
2,Fact-checking disaster,"Tons of mistakes, fact-checking kind. Not good as reference for magical fantasy genre writing. Would anyone really try what is in this book?"
1,typical,"As usual this book fits beginners who are looking exploring these types of practices. This would be the 3rd book from this author that I read and find that the title most certainly does not fit the read itself. It does not completely speak on one religious practice nor does it contain actual spells, magic, ceremonies or even grimoire worthy material (definitely not wiccan either), it's far from a complete anything.My credibilty: I do practice and am a priest in Lucumi (Yoruba) religion."
3,Thorough,"LOTS of information - historical, cultural, magical.For someone who wants to delve deeper into the background of ""Spells, Ceremonies, and Magic""Contains some info drawn from ancient past and across a broad spectrum of magical practices."
5,Lucky Town rocks!,"Lucky Town's debut album from 2000 hit the airwaves with a storm. The addictive track Simple has caught the ears of radio and MTV alike. The four members of this alt-rock band have a sound all their own. If you're lucky enough to catch them live, you will be astounded at how quickly they grab everyone's attention, and by the end of the night everyone is dancing. Their albums come close to capturing this energy - listen for yourself!"
1,Floppies are hard to come by.,"I'm having a hard time finding floppies to feed this thing. I tried Staples, Walmart, Target, and Costco. None of them carry floppies anymore."
4,Manager,"We love the convienence of having a floppy disk to store photos on, the camer may not take the best quality photos but it is sufficent for what we need."
3,This camera fits a specific niche,"The Sony MVCFD series of cameras was our Police Department's introduction into digital cameras. They filled a specific need because they allowed photos to be taken, and the floppy disk securred as evidence, without having Officers download, transfer, or copy (Evidence) images and possibly damage/lose them.Even though the Department has progressed to far more sophisticated cameras, the MVCFD 200 still has an important role in taking images of lesser evidential importance, applicant pictures, etc., where 2MP's is not a problem. This camera is such a work horse at our Department that they get used 24/7, without fail. An incredibly dependable camera, considering the wear and tear it recieves from a host of people. We have purchased at least four replacements over the last couple of years through sites such as Amazon, to keep this simple technology going as long as possible."
4,Sony...,Quite heavy but a good one. If you don't have problems carrying it with you then use it! Make sure to buy the Memory Stick because it is much better than relying on a floppy alone.
2,Camera Review,"The camera I purchased that was said to be in good shape is missing some pieces that make the use of it a little more time consuming. Other than that, it works okay."
3,Gaia but wrong book,"I ordered GAIA ""A new look at life on earth. What I received was GAIA ""The practical science of planetary medicine"". This book in itself is interesting, it's just not the one that I wanted & paid for. It was delivered within the time frame I was given, it was in great condition & I am happy with everything except it's just not the one I wanted."
5,great addition to dance classes,"My daughter is currently enrolled in ballet, this game helps to re-enforce dance positions and perform small dances.The included cards for the game can also be used as a memory game or a study guide for the name and dance positions.Is great for children interested in dance, movement or excersise, in addition to aiding those children already enrolled in dance schools."
2,"Great composition, bad recording",I love this piece of music but the piano is very obviously out of tune..I have no idea how this recording was put out...my upright piano that hasn't been tuned in years sounds the same as this piano
1,Crappy,"Typical of the crap that came out during that era, this sounded like every other Slaughter/Danger Danger/Ratt/Winger album out there, and they were all crap too. Nothing original in this ""hair metal"" scene at all."
5,My Grandson Loves It,"My 6 year old grandson loves this ball, it is the same colors as the Globetrotters. It fits him very well and he is able to handle it much better, smaller than full size basketball that he can not handle."
5,great basketball for a 5 yr old.,the youngest in the family needs his own size of basketball and this is perfect! It made him feel so important to have a ball that was a better fit in his hands. Quality is superb.
2,disappointed,"it does not hold air inside more than for 24 h. it came not fully inflated, after inflation it was normal just for one day :-("
2,Ships Deflated,Wish I had known it shipped deflated... this is a toys for tots gifts and now I have to find a way to inflate the ball before donating.
5,Wonderful Starting point,"This book is a great guide to the many rivers I have spent time on in Michigan. It is not going to put you on the honey-holes, but it will provide you with good maps and the right strategies to have a sucessful day on the river. It also provides area business #'s, which I have found helpful on several occassions. Jim Bedford knows what he is taking about. Great investment."
5,A Must for Michigan Flyfishers,"This guide is as inspirational as it is informative. Includes many odd bits of information (catch and release sections, no fishing from bank areas, areas too deep or too narrow to fish effectively) that would be very difficult to find out other than from hard experience. Very informative as to what fish you can expect to find in certain sections of streams -- I could go on and on. But won't. Just buy it!"
5,Bobby's Brooks,Excellent book about the many trout streams of Michigan. I think this book is essential for the first time fly fisherman to this large state.
4,A love story about growth in a marriage,"This book is a love story written by a husband years after loosing his wife. The fact that he never remarried during the 40 years after her death speaks to the depth of their love. It give insight into the grief process to help others deal with their own grief. We often think that we are the only ones to ever suffer this deeply, but it happens to many. This author put it into writing for those of us us don't have the talent."
1,On my top 10 WORST,"First of all, let me say that I am a Christian woman...undoubtably the audience for whom this book was written. It is truly one of the worst books I've ever had the displeasure of reading. If I hadn't told a friend I would read it, I never would have slogged through the sickning, simpering, sentimental, gooey self-flattering portrait the author thinks of as a love story. The characters are completely self-absorbed, selfish and disfunctional. The husband places his wife, albeit dead, on a pedistal so absurdly madonna-esque that instead of feeling sorry for his loss, I wanted to throw the book through a window and run away....fast. Don't waste your time."
1,spiritual exhibitionism,"I wrote a review of this book a year ago, but it has been deleted. My opinion is unchanged. It is shallow, sentimental, and exhibitionist--a pathetic example of what passes for profundity in our time. It also attributes remarks to C S Lewis that no one who has read his books (or knew him)would regard as accurate. I earnestly hope it will soon go out of print and vanish into the obscurity it so richly deserves."
3,"Super book, Poor edition","I have loved this book over the years for all the reasons stated in the other reviews printed here and purchased it again here recently as a gift. You, too, will love the read. However, my comments are regarding the edition that is being offered here. The book quality from this publisher is exceedingly poor and not worth buying. Both the paper and the print are of the cheapest quality and are not worthy of a book of this excellence. Get the book, but get it from a better publisher."
4,Good book,"A poignant tale of a couple who find each other and then find something even better: the Lord. Van, the author, loses his wife to an unknown disease but perhaps because of it, truly finds his relationship with Jesus."
4,A classic,"Well worth the read. I had heard of this book for years, but it somehow managed to slip through the mental cracks. This copy is on my shelf so I may reread in the years to come, revisit like an old friend."
5,Beautifully written!,"This book is a work of art...descriptive imagery, romance, and above all a wonderful example of God's work in a believer's life for their ultimate good and for His glory. I will read this multiple times, I'm sure!"
2,Mostly a waste of time,"I was tempted to give this 1 star, however, the author did write a few great lines in this book. The letters from C.S. Lewis and a few of the stories told about the author's interactions with Lewis were also well worth reading. Overall I found this book tedious and boring. I was expecting a beautiful story of love and conversion but instead found an overblown tale that reeked of self importance and moral superiority. The love story was not moving or touching but more like something from a teenage romance novel. Maybe I just wasn't rich enough or smart enough to ""get it""."
5,"An excellent romance, combined with a spiritual quest.","My wife and I read this book years ago. The author and his wife embark upon a spiritual quest to disprove the myth of Christianity. In the process they become acquainted with C.S. Lewis, and ultimately find the truth about the practical Christian faith--through a severe mercy.We would like to locate a hardcover copy, but it is no longer available from the publisher. If you have one in stock, please let us know. Greg."
2,Seriously?,"This is my first review, compelled by the horribleness of this book. I read it at the recommendation of a friend, who claimed it one of his all-time favorite books. In a word, scary. I previously would have declared it impossible such outrageous egos as Vanauken's exist. Be afraid - indeed they walk among us. But the book was not completely without merit. At least the self-aggrandizing tone of the author was humorous (albeit unintentionally) on occasion, when not sickening. Too, one came away feeling even more (if possible) admiration for the great C.S. Lewis through his letters to Vanauken. It seems through a sense of Christian duty he humored Vanauken. God bless him. Challenging though it must have been, Lewis exemplified prudence and patience in his correspondence with such vast vapidity.And I think Davy a saint."
3,"Pretty good book, a fun and easy read!","This book takes a lot of urban legends, some I had heard, some I had not, and proves them wrong. The author sites his research, so you know that it was actually investigated.This book sort of takes the fun out of some urban legends, but a lot of them, that you just knew couldn't be true, are proved to be false. So from now on, when my friends send me all these crazy emails, I can tell them they are a hoax and actually have a source."
3,"Good collection, but most stories recycled","Being a fan of urban legends, I picked this one up immediately. Although a good collection of stories, I found that many of the legends presented were found in the much-suggested series of books by folklorist Jan Brunvand. If you like UL's, definately pick them up.This book did introduce some modern legends that were welcomed, such as the Richard Gere gerbil story (always wanted to hear more about that one) and the good ole Wizard of Oz legends.Overall, not a bad book. Pick this one up if you can't find ""Vanishing Hitchhiker"" or ""Curses! Broiled Again"""
1,NOT VERY ORIGINAL,"I picked up this book the other day and thought that it wouldbe a true ""original"". Unfortunately, Mr. Roeper has chosen asubject that not too many other books have been written about. Not surprisingly, Jan Brunvand has written about this subject before, and in my opinion has done a better job. I was also disappointed about the number of Urban Legends listed. Sorry Richard...with the advent of all the Urban Legends now found ciculating on E-mail... and the ease at which Urban Legends can be found on the internet, you seemed to choose to cash in on this bit of phenom. You're a gifted writer...try tackling something a bit more difficult. Your long time readers here in Chicago will appreciate it. END"
3,pretty good,overall i like jan harold burnvard ul boks are better but richard roper comes off pretty well. he tends to focus more on famous people legendrs than the classic. however urabn legend experts or novices can both enjoy this book.
5,It's Richard!,"If you're not from the Chicagoland area, you don't know that Richard Roeper is one of the coolest guys around. So buy this book, it's worth it!"
3,Perfect for teens,"""Urban Legends"" by Richard Roeper is a light read perfect for a teen audience. This book touches on most of the common urban legends, the welcome to the world of AIDS urban legend, whether Tupac is really dead, Tommy Hilfiger on Oprah and other urban legends that have been rehashed over time. The book dispells what is truth and what is fiction. Overall though this book doesn't really tell readers what can't be found on the Internet or in other books. It's an entertaining book."
4,Finally the truth is revealed!,"If you have ever questioned the truth of any story that begins with ""A friend of a friend told me...."" then this is the book for you. What sets this book apart from other collections of urban legends, is Roeper's investigations of the facts behind the stories. Every legend in the book has been carefully researched and although it comes as no surprise that most of these rumors have no basis in fact, it is neat to see how urban legands can become public relations nightmares!This is a great way to pass the time while you are waiting for a check from Bill Gates after you have tested his e-mail tracking program."
2,Not impressed,I was hoping to get a cheaper version of another lotion I was using but I really don't like the results. Leaves a film on my face and doesn't make my face feel clean. Stopped using it after a couple of weeks.
2,Poor Photography!,"Lots of pictures that don't correspond to the text. Ok for an entertainment vehicle, but not if you want to learn about Mexican Art! Talks about a seated statue of a person and all you see is the head. Very poor photography. Not well thought out. For me it is a waste of money. I expected a more professional job and more professional DVD of Mexican Art."
3,TWO one hour programs on TWO dvd's ...PLEASE...,"KULTUR is usually quite a good company, but I was rather disappointedin these. More, I always find it irritating when the manufacturer usesTWO dvd's and Extra packaging where one dvd would be plenty. This isNOT my favofite purchase from this company. I would label the wholeexperience...disappointing."
5,"Safe, effective workout!","I dance ballet and am a Pilates enthusiast. I also have scoliosis. And, that is especially the reason for this rave review of AeroAbs. Because the weights are lifted while lying, rather than standing, the spine is stabilized. You get a thorough abdominal workout, and It will make you sweat!"
2,average at best,"Beyond the wriiter's functional understanding, I certainly don't understand the hype behind the book. an issue or two of milo would serve one better. aside from the fact I think friend's employees at Ironmind worte the previous reviews"
5,The best book i have read,And i have read hundreds of books on strength training.but this book is my favourite and no 1 cause the advice is very basic and good and it is fun to read.u will be laughing endlessly and at the same time acquiring useful information.This book is a must if u are into serious training without using steroids. I insist everybody to get this book if they dont have it right now.
2,HiProteen and Energol and York Barbell,"I got the book and I was not seeing anything revolutionary here, the same old stuff ""tricep pushdowns, benching,etc"" there isn't anything here that is unique. A lot of these ""stories"" are of course fake (read Muscletown the story of York barbell) as you will see numerous references to York barbell products (HiProteen and Energol). Its nothing more than stories to sell York products. The stories are very cheesy, and nothing in here is an ""article"" on lifting as we know it, everything is in a story format. True squats will get you big, but thats pretty much common knowledge. I found absolutely nothing of importance, no mentioning of deadlifts or pressing overhead (overhead pressing is the key to getting big chest as was done in the old days). These are stories as told to a 5th grader. Very dumbed down."
3,"Decent read, but with todays new research I wouldnt rely on it","This book is of course a collection of magazine articles from the 1970s for Johns series, Something I would say good for the book is that the stories in it are interesting, however the information is very outdated, such as working back and legs on the same day, thats a recipe for disaster. Other information like the ""Get Big Drink"" contains almost 3200 calories which he advised to drink every day, this would cost major money on milk and not to mention increase your bodyfat percentage by 10 percent in a month, And he strongly advocates the behind the neck press,which is a leading cause of neck pain. I just wasnt very interested after reading the first half of this book because i already knew most of it was wrong. I wouldnt recommend this book much at all."
2,Very overestimated,"I really don't understand why so many people like of this book. Maybe because they read it when they were were ignorant about strengh training or they were very young to know the difference between usefull knowledge and training bravado. Except by some few abbreviated routines this book is all about excessive volume and excessive frequency, wiht absolute none notion about realistic training:- To have shoulders like Reg Park you need train like him. He uses 300lbs in the behind neck press, so you nedd use too 300lbsMany teenagers can be hurted or frustrated by this kind of nonsense. Oh, and the specialization? This is hialrious: train 3 times a week your regular routine and in the other 3 days do your specialization routine.BAD INFORMATION IS MUCh WORSE THAN NONE INFORMATION. THIS BOOK IS 70-80% BAD INFORMATION."
2,Not very effective,"I wanted a liquid product to maintain sparkling water in my hottub. Granules take awhile to dissolve. The chemicals in this product are supposed to bind with tiny particles in the water to make sure they cannot pass through the filter. After about two weeks use (and almost a whole bottle), the water was still cloudy. It is possible that I have another chemical problem, so I don't want to be too harsh on this product, but it did not clear the water."
1,brite an clear,"Do not waste your money, there are other products that work much better than this one"
5,Works great,"Works great, nice clear water now! 2nd bottle purchased, use about once per week.Use in 8 person hot tub"
3,Capulina Speedy Gonzalez(1970),"Capulina Speedy Gonzalez(1970) isn't high art, but it wins points just for being fun. Nowadays, Mexico's film industry isn't as active as it used to be. By the way, Warner Brothers' cartoon character Speedy Gonzalez doesn't appear in one frame of this film. Capulina(Gaspar Henaine) is framed for robbing a bank; he must help the Sheriff find the real thieves. When Capulina eats bread with hot peppers, he runs around Benny Hill-style! Lovely, Mexican comic actress Leonorilda Ochoa(La Alegria De Vivir) plays Capulina's love interest. There's no extras on this DVD and it abruptly ends as soon as ""Fin"" appears on the screen. This western-comedy was made in the same vein as Blazing Saddles(1974), but it's nowhere as vulgar. This film is in Mexican Spanish with no subtitles. The music score is quite good. Capulina Speedy Gonzalez is a fun way to kill 90 minutes if you're a Mexican Film Buff."
2,Moderately Poor,"The binding was warn on this book and when using it, the book split and pages fell out."
5,Awesome!,"I would definitely recommend this book! The characters are so realistic and vibrant, and the story is fun and interesting. I couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happened next to Trace and her friends. The author really understands how teenagers think and act."
2,A 13 year old's dream come true...and my nightmare come true,"When I was a 13 year old girl I had a wild imagination, and this book would likely have been my dream come true then.Only, when reading it now, when the characters are between the ages of 17-18, it's quite frustrating. The lack of believabilty makes the book lose all credibilty. It's impossible to relate to any of the characters, and the lack of detail makes Trace's struggle to find her father uninteresting.When I finished the book I was so frustrated that I dropped the book in the tub."
3,Just ok,"This was the first book by Trish Cook that I've read. It was an okay book. Most teen books I find to be really fun to read, but for some reason this book was lacking that same excitement."
3,Good Product Bad Service,The boots were great. We loved them! But the first time they came you sent a size 6 in a size 7 box. Size 7 is what we ordered. The second time a size 91/2 was in the size 7 box. I couldn't beleive it so returned that also and ordered from another company. Very disapointed cause she really liked the boots.Very imbarrasing also cause it was supposed to be a Birthday present
1,Rat Poison,This is not the Antilope I rememeber from the 50's. This is a fusty old dowager's perfume that has been sitting in the back of a closet gathering dust. How perfectly horrid this is. Overly spicy and musky.
3,"Should be titled ""Pocket Atlas of Medieval History""","This is a rather small book for an atlas - bad on me for not looking at the posted dimensions. Now I understand the one-star reviewer's complaints about the maps. They're just too small to have labels for major rivers or other landmarks. And if you're anywhere close to middle-age you'ld better have your reading glasses handy because the type is exceedingly small. I'm still glad to have the book. I just would prefer to have it in a normal-sized book (rather than a ""mini-me"" version)."
3,Not what I expected.,"Full of information, but the maps were a disappointment. I was looking for maps in the medieval style. These were modern, two color tribe locations and not much else."
4,Medieval Atlas,"#I think that the other reviewers have covered this one pretty thoroughly, so I am here mostly just to agree with them-though it is pretty dated, the Atlas of Medieval History is an indispensible source covering trade routes, political maps, and history itself from 363 to 1478. I too appreciate how it focuses primarily on Europe, though not to the point of ignoring or unfairly portraying the rest of the world. For a beginner to medieval history, this book can really put things in perspective for you, covering all the duchies, states, and emirates spanning Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa in this period. A handy reference for a student or amateur historian."
3,"Well, this was interesting","I did not follow the 2008 real life story, so this is all new to me. I figured the movie would have begun with the girls making the pact and telling us why they planed to get pregnant, but instead we see a bunch of girls pregnant, some already with child and their just having babies for the fun of it. it isn't til the 55 minute mark where the pact is actually brought up. The movie actually makes the girls look dumb and naive. Some are I know 2 15 year olds and a 17 year old that were pregnant, it was shocker to everyone....except me. I saw it coming. Regardless this is a serious issue, you can find the stats everywhere online. Ever watch MTV's 16 and Pregnant? Apparently that show hasn't helped much.On a side note The Video Blogger has gorgeous eyes."
5,Warm toes,"I work outside in the fall and early spring, sometimes standing on cold concrete for long periods of time. These are great when the cold starts to set into your feet!! It makes a long cold day a lot easier. I reccomend these!!!"
4,great,I could not ride my horse in the winter without a pair of these on each time. They fit great in my boots and keep my feet comfortable I really like them
4,Warm & toasty,"I bought these to use on a recent trip to South Dakota in April. As a thin blooded, southern girl, I knew I would need some help staying warm. What I wasn't prepared for was blizzard weather and sleeping in a tent in 9 degree weather. Once I figured out how to layer, these toe warmers worked like a charm!! The only problem I had was getting them to stick well while trying to put on add'l layers over them. Nice and toasty once that task was accomplished. I wouldn't go back without them."
2,bad design,"After reading all the positive reviewers, I think they work for the company. The problem with these over-priced ""toe warmers"" is that they are not very practical. If you put this ""toe warmer"" on top of the insert of the shoe, the adhesive is so strong it will rip the insert if you are not very careful. So then the next approach would be to just stick it on your sock, right? Good luck! The adhesive is strong enough to destroy a shoe insert, but hardly strong enough to stick to a sock. So once you try sticking it to your sock and then putting a shoe on, you will find the ""toe warmer"" will roll up in a ball in the process, leaving what amounts to a rock in your shoe. Also, if you do stick them to an insert, they are too small to do the overall foot much good at staying warm.I recommend the large inserts that don't have these problems... but they are even more over-priced."
2,They work well - for a short time,"Advertised to work for 6 hours. My experience has not been anywhere close to that (1 hour max.). I wear them while bicycling, in between 2 socks. They're great at the start, but fade quickly."
1,Barely warm while others do not het at all,Bought these 40 pairs in box made in China. Some of them do not heat while others produce a little heat for up to 2 hours. Threw them away and bougth them from local Prinston Sports store (made in Japan). The Japan version does really heats up.
3,heat treat toe warmer,"It was advertised as adhesive. It was not adhesive. It tended to move in the shoe unless the shoe was tight, in which case it did not warm up much."
1,It's different from the website description,"I saw some reviews mentioning it contains 40 pairs, but I only got one pair!!! The website describes that the product is 14.1 x 3.1 x 5.3 inches. It's a lie!! I only got one small pack smaller than my hand!! Don't believe the description. I really regret buying this..."
1,deceiving.. shipment included only ONE warmer,Over $6 for ONE warmer! That's crazy. What is someone even going to use only ONE warmer??!! Very disappointed. Listing is deceiving. Amazon should remove this company from their site.
5,Simply amazing,I had high hopes when I ordered this book and was blown away by the art. Best I've ever seen. A must-buy for any comic book or art fan.
5,Superb.,"Thank you Alex Ross for coming along and defining the next level in superhero literature. Mr Ross takes inspriration from so-called Golden Age and Silver Age references. By moving the genre forward, Mr Ross is defining the first Age of comic books in the 21st century."
2,Should have been better...,"Wow. I love Alex Ross, and he has soooo many beautiful pieces that they shouldn't have had any trouble finding classic, beautiful images.This calandar is half filler. Some months are nothing more than pictures of toys based on Ross's paintings. That's ridiculous. I could have settled for the design art that the toys were made from, but I didn't buy a calandar of the artist's works to see lame products several times removed from the actual art.High hopes led to great disappointment."
4,Really good book,More an inside in Ross' work and his drawings than the mythology of the dc characters... beautiful book
5,A Alex Ross booK? Excellent!!!,It is a pleasure to be able to see the evolution of the drawings of Alex Ross! An unlosable book for the appraisers of art and of the comics!!
5,Beautiful!,"The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again.A must-have for comic book fans."
5,Magnificient Foot Powder - The Best!,"I've tried numerous foot powders to help keep my feet comfortable and kill odors and this Gold Bond Maximum Strength foot powder is the only one that fully works. I've tried others that absorbed sweat but didn't do a thing to really make my feet feel better or keep down their odor - this product you can actually feel working. Like another poster wrote, 'it's like I can feel a snowstorm in my boots' (something like that), it's true you can actually feel it working. For me it's like a foot massage with menthol or eucalyptus. My feet feel cooler and fresher and they don't smell anymore! This is great stuff, buy it and you will not regret it!"
5,Helped with blisters,"I mainly bought this because I was getting horrible blisters on my toes out of nowhere and I didn't want to buy the stuff that adds a second layer to your skin because that would just prevent blisters, not get rid of them. I know this is mainly for sweaty feet and odor but it did wonders for the blisters on my toes in 2 times of using it.I know some people were complaining about the scent being too strong but I personally didn't notice it. It does have a menthol smell to it but it's so mild I couldn't smell it once it was on my feet.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and I will buy again once I run out."
5,Feet like thus!,"I use this on my feet alot. Keeps them dry & stink free. I also lightly dust my shoes with it, helps keep moisture & stink down. Great!"
2,Don't like this product.,"This product contains menthol and because of that, when I applied it to my feet, it made them feel hot and sweaty. If you like applying menthol to your feet for the warming effect, then you will like this foot powder, but if you don't like the feeling of hot feet, then pass on this powder as I will in the future."
4,If You Don't Have It Get It,"Dragonball Z: Budokai 3 was an excellent, fun-filled game.There are over 35 characters to unlock and more then 6 battlefields to unlock.It' an exciting game you can't live without. Characters from DBGT and DBZ movies make you want to come back and play it again! One positive is that there's always something to do. If you were a true gamer you'd take advantage of the fact that amazon.com has it!"
4,Dragon Ball Z,This was a birthday gift for a little boy and he just loved to old games and he is still playing the game everyday.
2,Not Happy this time,It came too scratch back and forth and dusty didn't took the time to clean it up. and is not worth the price ether.
2,Budokai3 ROCKS,"Budokai3 is the greatest game.It got 40 characters.There some characters from budokai1 and 2.Some of the characters are Bardock,Brolly,Chotzu,cooler,Guldo,Burter,Super Android 13 and 17and all evil Shenron and many many more characters.When this game comes out you guys better buy it."
1,Waste of money,not the game itself but the price. you could get this with budokai 1 and in HD at gamestop for $20 less. The Game Is Fun But Waste Of Money.
5,OMG ----NOISE!,"I love to turn this game up on the surround sound when no one is home and really have some fun--I think it is much better in the sound effects department than the others. Tons more screaming too. I didn't get Dragonball Z 2 because I heard some really negative reviews but I enjoyed Budokai 1. I got this a few weeks ago and it really is the best DBZ game to date in my opinion. I like really fast fighting games like Guilty Gears...I didn't even get the new MK because MK Deadly Alliance felt slow to me---so did Tekken 4....but this is one super fast game...teleport rules---instantanious teleport!!!! I think the the graphics are great--colors are very vivid. And if you get the game used and it has no instructions, just go through your training mode first...no big deal--it's all in there. And Trunks kicks butt on this one...check it out."
5,An unforgetable Budokai Video Game: Perfect for Hardcore Gamers,"I hated the first Budokai, the second wasnt too bad, but once this one hit I was seeing stars. This is the best Budokai game that has ever been released. Shin Budokai, Infinate World has nothing on this game. The gameplay, the characters, everything about this game is good. If you have a PS2 you better have this game somewhere in your collection. Never ever let this game collect dust because it is a master piece!"
3,Simple but fun game,"DBZ B3 is great because it is a ton of fun and it is simple to pick up and enjoy. The characters controls are all the same (eventhough action animations are all different) so it is very simple to pick up new characters from the huge available list and just go to town. Its just fun- strategicly speaking, certain characters have certain strengths, some have more effective attacks and resource management than others, but if you want a fighter that you are just gonna have fun with---pick it up! Not being a DBZ fan isnt that important- but it is helpful to know at least a bit about the show."
5,The Best One of the DBZ Budokai Video Game Series,"I have several DBZ video games, including the ones for the Japanese SNES, Sega, and Playstation; I also have all three DBZ Budokai video games for the PS2, and by far, DBZ Budokai 3 is the best DBZ game ever made. The excellent 3-D cell-shaded graphics make it seem as if you are taking control of the anime series, and the well-balanced gameplay mechanics have finally been perfected in this last DBZ Budokai video game by Atari."
5,You all should know the truth about a certain something.,"For the record, I'm not a kid, I'm simply posting under this status because I'm too busy to register at the moment. Anyway, the point of this post is a warning to all of you about Amazon and how it's selling Budokai 3. If this site ever happens to sport the cover of the ""Greatest Hits"" version, then Amazon is false advertising. They don't have the GH version to sell and they'll simply send a copy of the original November 2004 release instead. Read all about this business here: [...]Here's a fantastic editorial detailing everything you need to know about the Greatest Hits version of the game: [...]As you can tell, it's obviously an upgraded version, containing many different and new elements. In a sense, it's an entirely different game. Don't order Budokai 3 from Amazon if you're expecting the Greatest Hits release, you'll only get shafted with the original. You've all been warned."
4,fun.,This game is really fun. I have all but uub and omega shenron unlocked(Inclouding ss4 vegeta and goku fusion. Again I need omega shenron. Anyone know how to get him.?
5,This Is The GAME,"This is going to be the best dbz game ever.The characters areunbelievable. They have Kid Goku, Goku,kid gohan,teen Gohan,AdultGohan,Great Sayianman,kid Trunks,Teen Trunks,Adult Trunks,kid Goten,Teen Goten,Vegeta,Gotenks,Vegito,Gogeta,Tiencha,Yamcha,TienSupreme Kia,Kabito kia,Uub,Majuub,All forms of buu,All forms ofCell,Cell Jr,All forms of Frieza and Cooler,Brolly,Bardock,Allforms of Baby,Android 16,17,18,19,and 20,Super Android 17,SynShenron,Omega Shenron,All shadow Dragons,The Ginyu Force,Spice Boys,Garlic Jr,I know this because I have all kinds of magazines so Im sure"
1,bad game,this game is bad. you cant fly not even when they hit you. it only goes up to buu. you cant sleep or eat. this game is stupid
2,Are you religious?,"I'm not religious, I just want to spend my time more productively. I hoped this book would help do that for me but it never connected with me. I think this book is more about making money off porn addicts than actually helping them. Just join an online website and you'll get everything from this book and more!"
5,Purchase Review,"This book was delivered within a couple of days of ordering--very fast!! Also, the book arrived in pristine condition. I'd definitely order from this seller again."
5,Superb!,I really read this publ. from cover to cover as soon as I get the magazine. I have to exert my authority to make my daughter let me read first as she loves it also.
4,"Great Magazine, Fast Service","After having read earlier reviews about very slow magazine shipping times through Amazon, I was pleasantly surprised to get my first Hobby Farm magazine in a few weeks or so. I love this magazine; lots of great ideas and inspiration. I also subscribe to Mother Earth News, which is not as specific to hobby farming as this mag."
2,Auto Renewal,"While the product is o.k.--the fact that it was an auto renewal was NOT o.k. In this case, I would have preferred to cancel it., but was not able to by the time I knew about it. It was sent as a gift and that person no longer has need of the subscription."
3,guinea hens,"don't be put off by the reviewer who complained about corrections. I haven't read the magazine yet, but it was recommended yesterday by a woman farmer I was visiting. Her small flock of guinea hens demonstrated their ""watch bird"" skills by flocking together and trying to intimidate my leashed Bichon. And talk about a racket! They were LOUD! She commented approvingly ""wow, watch them work him! A flock of 30 would be really intimidating!"" So perhaps both the original article AND the correction were true -"
1,Not a review.,"I just don't know if I have this yet, am going to check with magazines. this is the first time I have renewed or taken out a subscription via internet, but idea is sound and easy."
5,Interesting and Practical,Hobby Farms draws you into their 'meaty' articles with good photos and clear writing. The articles aren't just fluff- they present usable info that helps you succeed on small scale raising-your-own-food acreages.
2,Superficial and trivial,"I subscribed to this publication after I purchased a copy locally. After two issues I am ready to cancel. I need info and ideas to help me farm. There is a heavy emphasis on livestock, which I do not have. The actual farm production articles are brief, superficial and lacking in technical data. The pictures are pretty, but I don't need recipes, pet photos and other nonsense. The info in this mag is not as good as your average organic garden mag, and certainly not much help for a serious farmer. If you farm for tax reasons or just want a cheaper version of Country Living, you may like it. If you don't and you really need to make money farming, try Acres. It's a bit ""out there"" sometimes but you will get solid info from real farmers like Joe Salatin.Acres U.S.A."
5,Wonderful magazine for dreaming homesteader,"This is a top notch magazine that both my wife and I enjoy. It has great articles on gardening, animals, and homesteading in general. There is such a variety of subjects that we can always find something to read and have learned much from the articles. I also love Hobby Farms Home which I was skeptical would just be a scaled down copy of the original Hobby Farms, but there is such a diversity in the articles that both magazines are a must. If you enjoy raising your own vegetables or dream about owning your own goats to make homemade cheese, this is the magazine for you."
2,meh,It was an interesting idea for a magazine but falls far short of it's promise. They should give it to you free as it is primarily a vehicle to deliver advertisements
4,give it a chance....,"I own both Automatic Man Lp's. when I heard the first album I wasn't really that impressed ( giving new records a quick scan through), but the the more i listened .....the more I grew to love. Love grew like a wart on my nose and soon it was and still is one of my favorite albums. I even made a cd compiling both albums. Suffice to say all tracks fit on one cd ...except for one. If you loved the first album, the second is defiantly worth the purchase. A band of talented musicians who only released two albums is crazy! Full of great skill and progression, i believe it's a great follow up to the first album. Spacey and filled with catchy hooks. how could you deny? And if you haven't heard the first buy it as well. I'm not sure if the cd can compare to my scratchy well worn vinyl but who cares, it's a unique delve that most people don't even know about!"
3,Nothing like the first but still a good soul/funk/Northern Soul 70's disc,"To be fair half the original band, their original collaborator/manager and unique vibe was no longer apart of the act.The first Automatic Man is arguably one of rocks most mercurial and artistic creations as well as being perhaps one of the best Super groups after Cream certainly the most funky of them all.Sounding like a less produced version of Earth, Wind and Fire or a less top 40 version of The Commodores is not necessarily a bad thing (or a good thing depending o what you enjoy....)Todd Cochran, then known simply as ""Bayete"" gave a great amount of energy and song writing to this piece plus all the musicians are top knotch. I can't see any funk/soul fan being disappointed. To me it sounds like Northern Soul/Stanton meets early 80's Funk which isn't quite my kind of music. But do give it a chance as it's better than 95% of what's on airwaves today."
5,Outstanding for musicians,"I'm a drummer who has been playing for a long time and I've always been searching for the perfect earplugs for playing gigs. Most off-the-shelf plugs kill the high end and cut out far too much sound. Most of the specialty plugs are way too expensive. My search has ended with these Etymotics, which I've now been using regularly for about 2 years.Two things make them perfect for me: First, they offer a gradual reduction in external sound rather than an extreme muffling. Second, the reduction is very well balanced across the frequency spectrum. You still get pretty clear high end and low end, just that the volume is reduced. In fact, that's the best way to describe them... they simply turn the volume down on the outside world, while maintaining excellent clarity. This is a must for me as a singing drummer. They're also very comfortable.One drawback: they stick out a little bit, so they can look a little dorky. I'd suggest buying the clears rather than the colored ones."
3,Great re-usable plugs,"I work in a Power plant and the noise levels are on par with being on the tarmac of an airport (24-7). I use these (blue tips) vs the self molding foam because of the superior fitment. Clarity is outstanding, but total dB isolation could be better. While not up to par vs a -33dB set, they offer exceptional overall freq reduction. I have 3 sets I have been using everyday for the past year."
4,Work well,"These are great for almost all applications. I'm a drummer and use them during band practice. Gave it a four star for two reasons: 1 - mainly cause there not the best against very high pitch loud sounds (i noticed sometimes when we got loud feedback that it still kind of hurt my ears) 2 - they stick out of your ears kinda far (really not that big of a deal). However, for a well performing product at this price this low, neither of those should be a big deal. Overall, great ear plugs. I can definitely hear other the other instruments in the band much clearer (not muffled like it was with other ear plugs)."
5,Great for concerts!,There's not much to say here that hasn't already been said. I love concerts but due to some hearing loss it can be painful if the sound is too loud. These cut the volume on the sound without reducing the quality. I tried them out at a concert last week and it was perfect - you can't go wrong with these!
1,Beware the purchase of these plugs,"I don't normally provide feedback on products because usually they work reasonably. This is the exception. This product is absolutely hopeless and not fit for purpose. Having tried to jam these into my ears in several different ways following various permutations of the instructions, there seem only two possible outcomes. Either perforate your ear drums or get no worthwhile sound attenuation.I am at a loss to understand the various favourable reviews that persuaded me to order this product (in fact I bought two sets). I can only conclude that it is critically dependent on what the actual geometry of your ear canal is. If it is one in which the plugs can nestle, then they work as advertised. If it is not, you are out of luck and they are worthless and painful to boot. As there seems no way of knowing this in advance, I would be very cautious in the purchase of these products."
2,so-so,"I bought a pair of these based on great reviews, however I was disappointed. The plugs aren't very comfortable for long wear, and I couldn't hear people's voices well in a nightclub/concert setting. So, I'm not actually using them."
2,Wonderful but fragile,"I have been meaning to write this: I bought these earbuds and found them thoroughly satisfactory; they fit well, excluded ambient noise and seemed to have very good sound. But the left one stopped working altogether before they were two years old. They had been treated very well; I couldn't blame my handling for the problem. I used them only when I was at a gym doing exercise that involved only my legs.I have found no earbuds since those that are as comfortable and sound-isolating. But my experience with etymotic precludes my buying these again."
2,I personally don't like this item at all..,I feel no difference than a normal in-ear headphone except u don't play any music.
1,headphones a piece of crap.,"far from the sound quality of the ones that come with the iPhone, this piece of junk has ridiculously high treble and no bass. It's a piece of crap. Airplane headphones are better than this and we all know how crappy those are!!"
2,disappointing,LOVE JIM DALE but even he can't make this interesting. It was really a waste of time and money. We listen to books on cd all the time and it was painful to make everyone listen to this all the way through. It's not long at all- just feels like it
4,Fabulously narrated story and wonderful music,"This is wonderful for all ages! The story is terrific and the narration and music really bring the book to life. The children's choir adds to the depth of the recording (and is terrific). Our whole family has enjoyed this! I'd have given it 5 stars but there are some sound level/volume challenges during the recording (which means you have to adjust the volume a tad so you can hear or so it's not too loud). Despite that, it is still WONDERFUL! The story is captivating and is packed with teachable moments/morals. Highly, highly recommended!"
3,Not Great - 3-stars,"I am somewhat familiar with the subject as I publish esoteric books....This one is too scholastic and not sufficiently on track of the mysteries of talisman magic. Any book that does not contain yantras, numerology, magic squares is incomplete at best."
2,A bric a brac of commonness,"Nothing very special, lots of generality, we read about wicca, about Crowley, about Agrippa, the same everlasting stories about Honorius and his foolish grimoire of none sens, a very few seals of a very cheap values (not more than 5 or 6), this book hase not a great concern about amulets and talismans, it's about low magic in general. Dont wast your money, a good book on talisman hase not been written yet, en tout cas, not in english."
2,Not many pictures.....,"This book, although filled with a wealth of knowledge, is very confusing, and lacks pictures to help explain what is being described. If you're up for a night of frusrtation, read this, but don't expect any real answers."
2,Amulents and Talismans - By Migene Gonzales-Wippler,"I order this book and received a book of Amulents & Talismans by a different author. I am really getting discouraged because so far, I have received two books that I did not order. I ordered two other books that I have not received as of yet.If you can help me with these orders, I would truly appreciate it.Thank you,Mona Ghaffari"
5,Mexico City Rocky,Really enjoyed this hopeful film on the tough streets of Mexico City. Boxing is used as the tool to get a young Mexican boy off the streets by a father and son from the US who have little in common. Very good performances highlight the film.
3,Dubious...very dubious,"i wanted this album to be amazing, and it isn't. Engine Down is an amazing band, but this album just is not. The amazon review brings up a good point. but that still does not replace the fact that each song is boring and loses its flavor near the end. It sounds like Engine Down, which is a good thing, but the powerful explosions that made ""To Bury.."" so amazing are completely lost. each song slowly mumbles along and reaches a pleasant pinnacle, but drowns off into nothingness. these songs just aren't intriguing at all."
4,Good Shows and Funny,"Both of these episdoes are pretty funny. Johnny Carson is young and just starting on The Tonight Show when this episode was made. You can find out the ""secret"" of how Jack keeps going in this one.The Hawai episode has some funny very funny moments but not quite as entertaining all the way through. Light and fun, which is what Jack Benny is all about."
5,greatttttt,i really recommend this laptop. i did not encounter any problems. HP seems to have done a great job.
2,I'm not happy at all!,"I'm not happy at all!Ok. Long story short. In less then a week, after purchasing this, one of the slots where the screen opens and closes broke off. Tried to fix it, then, the DVD drive wouldn't work! I sent it back got my refund. I re-purchased the same computer laptop, Surprise surprise, dead pixels on the LCD screen. Returned it, was charged a restocking fee. Got another one. For no reason, one day the LCD just quit. Why did I attempt this three times? What was I thinking? Stay away from cheap, low prices pieces of garbage. It looked good. Under $700. 160 GB hard drive 1GB of ram, Dual layer DVD+/-RW drive upgradeable to 2. But, WARNING You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,Malfunctioning computer + Terrible customer support = Bad Purchase,"I purchased two of this model of laptop about four months ago. Since then, they have malfunctioned in many different ways. The most significant problem is that the trackpad stopped working on one of them within about two months. That's when I started with the nightmare of HP Customer Service!After a significant process, HP finally agreed to ""repair"" the notebook, which took nearly a month. When the computer was returned, the problem still existed. Now, when I talk to HP customer support, they tell me that I have to go through the exact same process again (install drivers, upgrade BIOS, reinstall Windows, etc), and then return the computer for repair again. When will they admit their mistake and simply replace the computer?"
4,A Cousin's Pride,"Peter Senese is my cousin and although bias may be suspect, I vow to give Peter's book a fair and honest review.Considering this is his first novel, Peter builds his characters rapidly, and grips you with the sinister intentions of his main villain, the ""Father"".Senese keeps you rooting for his main character, Tyler Cain, a savvy Wall Street operator, who has developed a fresh, revolutionary approach to health care and is about to run into a plot designed to destroy him and all of his plans.The tension builds, and one of Tyler Cain's executives is killed by mysterious means. Who did it and why is the big question.The only negative comment I would make is that the proofreading could have been improved upon. Grammatical errors are too frequent.But the book holds your attention and builds to a climax in the best tradition."
5,I think this is a good book,I do not read many books but I was given this one to read. I found it very good so I kept reading it.
4,Complex,"Senese painted a complex picture of Wall Street in this book. The pace moves in waves, with slower moving portions of the story typically a time where the author attempts to educate you regarding any number of aspects related to corporate finance or political issues. For the most part, he is successfull at this, even for this old-time financial planner. When brought into the action, I just kept turning the pages. Overall, a strong book. The one negative comment is that the book's print was to small for my eyes. I had to strain to continue reading. Four Stars - maybe Five if I didn't have to strain my eyes so much to keep reading!"
1,Don't waste your time or money...,"After reading some of the reviews, I have to ask myself if some of these people read the same book I did (or if they were ""friends"" of the author). I mean, hello! This book was in no shape to go to print. I wanted to take out my red pen and mark the entire book up like a grade school teacher. The writing is abysmal! Too many words piled on top of one another. I made it through a few chapters and then gave up. And don't even try to tell me that if I had stuck with it I would have been rewarded with a great story. Please.I'm just thankful that I didn't pay anything for this book! I hope that you won't either."
2,Confusing,The storyline was good but I got lost with too much financial information that I was unable to follow. I did like Judge Pitt's character.
1,?,"I read your reviews, and the book sounded good.What a waste of my time and money. I couldn't even get halfway through the book."
1,"Poorly conceived, many typos, bad grammar","The book is a poor mimic of typical five-and-dime James Bond wannabes, with far, far too many typographical and grammatical errors. No originality, no style of writing that a genuine novel shows, and in many instances the plot is forced. The ""author"" should not waste our time by putting out suck dreck. The book was painful reading."
3,"Good storyline, too technical","For the layperson unfamiliar with banking, I thought this book was too technically written. The storyline kept me going though."
3,"Okay, but I'm not ready.","Too close for my comfort level after September 11th, 2001. The details expressed are too familiar, and needless to say, the circumstances of terrorism made me read through most of this book- but I had to put it down because of the subject matter. Thought others might want to know. On a positive side, I did enjoy the author's writing style."
5,A suspenseful pace is unmistakeably set . . .,"A suspenseful pace is unmistakeably set in ""War On Wall Street's "" opening pages as a plane soars through the sky in route to New York City. Page after page, Peter Senese created a terrific suspense thriller that brings you into all that is New York. What awaits Tyler Cain, a seasoned banker working on Wall Street, is something he could never have been prepared for.""War On Wall Street"" is a masterfully developed story obviously based upon many historical events."
4,Classic Westcoast Compilation,"This is a great compilation with some of Cali's finest: T-Nutty, Cyco, G-MAcc all good rappers in my opinion. The best song on here is Paper Rout by Nyke Loc every thing comes off tight on that one, the hook sounds great. I also like The Way We Ride despite the fact that I had already heard it on a Garden Blocc compilation called Blocc Love, but it's a great song regardless. You can listen to most of the album without skipping a song that song by Dre Loc is okay 2."
4,"Pentateuch, by Michael D. Guinan",I needed this book for 4 week class that I'm taking. The information gives interesting insight into the first five books of the Bible
5,Good personal story combined with practical tips,"There is some overlap with his subsequently published ""The Hot Garden"" this is a personal story. It feels like you are javing a conversatnio with a friend who happens to be very good at garden design and is sharing his knowledge with you. Especially good discussion of outdoor living spaces."
4,Review of my L20V36,"In short, I like the tv. All of the positives mentioned in the other reviews are items I'd agree with. It seems like the picture is clearer when I go directly into the tv via the cable instead of through my digital cable box and then thru my Replay TV (via SVideo). I realize that going through 2 additional boxes may not be optimal, but I'd imagine many people have a similar configuration. Where I'm most disappointed is when I bring up my ReplayTV channel guide. The listings are sort of blury - kinda like an eye test where you say ""worse"" rather then ""better"" while the doctor is dialing in your script. Its readable, but not as good as my old crt with the same configuration. DVDs via the component video do look nice."
1,Rather poor quality,"First off you should know this is NOT an HDTV-ready TV monitor. It's the so-called EDTV with E standing for extended or enhanced depending on whom you ask. In any case it's not HDTV, and there's almost no program available (broadcast, cable or DVD) that supports this mode. Second this is a very poorly made display. You'd think for this price you'll get good quality. Unfortunately the answer is no in this case. The image quality and brightness is uneven, with a serious shadow cast over the lower half of the screen. The pixelation is very pronounced on this monitor, when compared to, say, a Sharp Aquos model. The word here is ""ugly."" Anything beautiful, e.g., a beautiful woman's face, looks terrible in blocky pixels. Finally the sound is inadequate. This is a very poor product. Most other Zenith LCD TVs are also very poorly made. If you are going to spend money on an LCD TV, get a Sharp Aquos. See my review of the 20"" Aquos model."
4,Samsung SCX-4521D3 toner cartridge,"If it is advertised accurately as under OEM specification, it is usually dependable. But it still has a long way to prove its claim: >3000 copies."
1,Bait & Switch,"Ordered this item and was sent a compatible cartridge, not the OEM as pictured and described and not by Amazon but by a 3rd party vendor. I had to put up with a song and dance and Amazon's terrible internet phone connection while dealing with their overseas customer service center. Amazon wants me to try to contact the 3rd party vendor because they could not get get hold of them when they tried while I was on hold! Amazon used to be a great company--what happened?"
4,bow tie exhaust,"I like this item,but I actually got it bigger than I saw it on line though. I guess I will make it work some how."
3,"not happy, not disappointed",the bends are not as defined as in the picture but still looks good. still shiny. ive gotten complement s already. but the fitment is a little odd. my pipe has a 2.5 outlet where this had a 3.25 inlet. so the size difference is a little troublesome. it came loose 2x since i put it on. but i think i got it now by bending the inlet of this pipe to make it closer to mine. hasnt came loose yet.
5,A must for poetry writers.,"To write great poetry one MUST learn about the ""science"" of poetry. Forcing oneself to operate with in the confines of a form is excellent practice."
3,Malloreon seems to be a weak immitation of Belariad...,"Belgariad was a good series... The characters were funny and likable. Its plot, believable. I had no trouble suspending my beliefs to go along with the storyline. In Malloreon series, the plot is too similar. The characters too static, as in they don't seem to grow except physically. Moreover, they are all becoming alike. Most male characters drink too much and most of the time are rather clueless. Female characters take too much delight in making male characters suffer... They are all too witty. It seems forced, almost. Some parts are still very funny but in my opinion, David Eddings took too much of his time trying to make his characters funny. But again, I loved Belgariad series, so I probably will give Malloreon one more try and buy the third book."
5,By far my favorite in the series!,"O.k., so like an unobservant fool I picked up this book without reading the fine print that said ""Book Two..."" but was pleasantly surprised that I had 6 previous books to read and 3 more to follow! From the first scene in the tunnels I was hooked. A reviewer of another of DE's books called his dialogue ""annoyingly cute"" or something to that effect; I personally found it to be just the right amount of ""cute"" (although ""cute"" would not be my personal choice in words). The discussion of the meaning of the word ""lost"" in the first chapter was wonderful. The sarcastic humor of Silk is what makes me re-read the books over and over. He is by far my favorite character in any fantasy book I've read! Just thinking about it makes me want to read all 10 again! (I havent gotten around to the final 3-ie Belgarath... Pol...and that last one- but I'll tell you, if any character deserves his own book(s) it's Silk!!!!!!!)"
5,A Great Read!,"I am surprised these other reviewers didn't like it. I, personally, loved the book! Eddings is an amazing foreshadower, giving you just enough info to know something's not quite right, but at the same time, he keeps things hidden, so that there are surprises! I can't wait to read the third one!"
1,Very disappointing,"I read and loved the Belgariad series, but I was so disappointed this time. Guardians of the West wasn't up to the same standard and King of the Murgos is awful. Wooden, predictable characters, cliched speech; the witticisms between the characters became tedious and the sudden revellations where character A urges character B to look closely at character C ""You know who he is!"" might have been believable the first few times, but quickly irritated. I shan't be completing this series: it's just an inferior re-run of the Belgariad."
3,Needs improvement,"Before I start, let me say that the Belgariad is the second best fantasy series ever written. Tolkien was the best and I don't expect him to be overthrown in my lifetime. But the Belgariad was spectacular. The Mallorean stinks. What made the Belgariad wonderful was the versatility and freshness of the characters. Silk had enemy's everywhere, and you could never tell what exploits might get him in trouble. But Eddings didn't use a single exploit that wasn't mentioned in the last books. And I'm sorry, the incident in Tolnedra was despicable. These people are not butchers. You don't go out and revenge yourself on people by indiscriminately cutting their throats. I enjoyed this book, but it was mostly because I grew genuinely attached to the characters in the last book. Personally, I blame the editor."
2,"Well, it is at least readable.","Eddings' writing style is readable, and that's the only way anyone can finish this book. This is one of the most repetitive and useless books in the world. Here's what happens throughout the whole book. They ride into a place with a lengthy description that means nothing to the reader, every character makes a bad, monotonous wisecrack about another's character's trait, they discover a little bit of information about a prophecy that we all know is going to take place, which we know who is going to win.This time, they ride into Nyssia, and then into Murgo. They talk to a few people, and everyone does their own thing. About ten pages out of the 400 or so pages further the plot along, and that's about it.It's boring, dull, and should not have been written."
3,eh...same as the first,"The reason i was excited to read the mallorean after reading the belgariad was to revisit the characters, but in the second book of the mallorean, most of the original characters are gone, replaced by new ones. neither set of characters is really outstanding, because david eddings seems more intent on making them all humorous and witty than really sketching them with depth. this said, i prefer the original set because i was familiar with them, and i enjoyed revisiting that ""family"" of characters in each book. the bad writing is still an issue, he cant let a page pass without one of his characters trying to say something clever/witty. and finally, this is a minor quibble, but, what is up with the nicknames? silk? velvet? what is this, a fantasy novel or a porno flick??"
4,don't be fooled by price,"this is just over half full price at other websites for $31.49.i'm getting one as a gift for a friend and have one i got 2nd hand, for my yet unborn..so i can't really rate it for usage as yet hence removal of one star. looks great though and gets wonderful reviews at said other sites!"
2,Overpriced for actual effectiveness,"I had a tarnished silver necklace and used this product on it. Helped somewhat but would have required lots of work. I then used my well-used cloth from years ago and immediately, the necklace was shining beautifully. One or two wipes with my old cloth; dozens for this one. Will not buy again."
2,Just Okay,"It a good price and it's a large cloth, but it really is only good for larger plain pieces. If you have silver that has intricate details and designs in the jewelry, this cloth is not going to do a good cleaning job. Sunshine Polishing Cloth is the absolute best I have ever used. That cloth cleans all in the beadwork, milgrain, and crevices of your jewelry. After cleaning, some of my silver looked better than it did when I purchased it. Sunshine is better than any liquid cleaner or cloth I have ever used. It even cleans when it's ""dirty""."
2,"Fascinating History, Awkwardly Written","I began following the Santa Cruz Island saga a few years back and have been fascinated by the family soap opera. The history of the place and the people associated with it is fascinating, which makes the book worth reading. Unfortunately, Mr. Gherini's attempt at telling the story is quite cumbersome and distracting. His clear animosity toward other family members makes for a whining, sniping portrayal which exposes his biases."
3,This TV is okay...,"I bought this TV from a local electornics store with about the same price. HDTV gives great detail but its almost 2 big for its own good. Most television shows are show in widescreen so bars sit on the sides of your tv while you watch tv. It also has small speakers if you buy this you might need to get other speakers. But other then that is an excellent purchase. Its a little hard to set up but, once its up it good. This wont break down on you at all."
5,"Karl Rove, I Love You = Magical Madness","As I went to see the movie ""Karl Rove, I Love You,"" I realized I had no idea what to expect from this film. I took my seat, the lights went down, and for the next 97 minutes I embarked on the twisted and magical journey of loving Karl Rove. It never failed to surprise or delight. The acting is pitch perfect and the directing/storytelling is so imaginative and always leaves one guessing. Truly a love story of unspeakable acts. I am so glad that no one told me what the movie was about because one must experience ""Karl Rove"" for themselves. It is a magical ride."
5,Great product & the price is right!,I shopped around both in stores and on-line before purchasing the Casio PV-400 Plus. I decided that for the money and with the features it has -- this one was the one for me. It does everything that I need to do. I especially like the Quick Memo feature that lets you write a note with the stylus and save it. I also like the size of the Cassiopeia. It's smaller and lighter than any of the other hand-held models and really does fit into my shirt pocket.
1,Syncing With Lotus Notes won't work,"I bought two of these units and really like them. One was for me and my Lotus Notes, and the other for my wife who uses Outlook.The problem, and the only reason for my one-star rating is that the third-party software that you need to use for syncing Notes makes Notes unstable and creates crashes. The software company actually acknowledges that they ""had"" a problem. After several attempts at fixing the problem with their technical support, including a full reload of Notes I gave up and ordered a Visor.We are keeping the one for my wife. We give it 5 stars when used with Outlook."
3,"Great, but dated","This item has many plus points, and some drawbacks. One of the pluses is that information saved stays on the internal flash unit, and is not lost when batteries fail. Another plus is that one can keep sensitive information private with the 'Secret' feature (password protected). The 'Expense' feature (for calculating expenses) is not user friendly in my opinion. My major gripe with the Casio PV-400PLUS Cassiopeia is that the back-light stays on for only 15 seconds, and that the time period it stays on is not adjustable. Without back-lighting, the screen is not that bright (even after adjusting the contrast). To keep pressing the 'Light' button every 15 seconds is not a useful option. All that being said, the 'Memo' ,'Quick Memo' , and 'Contacts' features are good, useful features. I recommend this item to those looking for a reliable little electronic note-taker, but don't recommend it for interfacing with a modern computer, or for its any of it's other features."
4,A SUPER MACHINE,"I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 3 YEARS IN OUR CARPET BUSINESS. IT IS QUICK TO USE, WINDOWS FORMAT. VERY USER FRIENDLY. I PAID 100.OO FOR MINE AND NOW THEY ARE 1/2 THE PRICE. YOU WON'T BE DISSPOINTED."
1,Make sure you have the right size...otherwise Amazon rips you off,"Bought the wrong size by accident (it's not that obvious which size you need) and called to see how I needed to return it. Well, Amazon required me to return it in their prepaid envelope for $5.11 (you know how big these are????) and a $1.80 restocking fee...net return to me $0...so they got the blade and I got nothing back...RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON. They don't tell you this when you call. Don't buy anything unless you are ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE it's the perfect size because if you do buy the wrong thing, don't bother returning it, they'll keep the money and the item. I'd have been better off keeping it!!!"
3,Too Basic,"I got this book for a college course Social Gerontology. Overall I found that the book was too basic and there were definitely some concepts that have been updated since it was published. I don't have any experience reading any other texts on this topic, but I imagine there is a more comprehensive, detailed book available. As mentioned in the title of the text, it's an introduction."
3,heart felt and silly,"I was skeptical when my son wanted to rent this movie, and though there are a few adult themed jokes, we ended up liking the movie. And my son likes to watch it so much, I bought it. Yes, the boy in the movie has cerebral palsy and he is funny and does a great job in this film. Great attitude. I wouldn't go to the theater to see it but, it is a good rental for young teens.It's worth a look knowing it is what it is."
1,Won't play DVD's,"I really liked the ease of set up and the compact size of the machine, but guess what, IT WON'T PLAY MANY DVD'S! Good to know ahead of time. I get a message that says this disc not formatted for this region, but it plays in the $49 DVD player I bought today. There is currently no recall so I will have to do battle with one of the big electronic stores to try to get my money back. Glad I saved the box..."
1,Death of a Mystery Plot,"After reading Death of a Sunday Writer, my desire to read a Canadian mystery novel is suffering a severe lack of vital signs.Maybe I was mislead into believing this was a mystery novel - but believe me, there is not a shred of mystery between its glossy covers. Lack of details, lack of description, lack of suspense.I was reminded of the stories I used to read in grade school - pleasant enough but not too demanding."
4,We lost Lucky TOO early.,"This CD, not available on Itunes (at least at the time), was purchased for the song ""Put a Little Love"" (worth every penny)and has several good songs. The recording is excellent/emotional especially on a loud stereo. This is a must for anyone who enjoys reggae, African or Jamaican."
3,Well made but did not work for my purpose,"I needed a mat for cushioning while I do sit-ups. The only thing that had worked to this point was an inflatable pad. I was hoping this mat would replace it but it does not offer quite enough padding. But my 5-year-old daughter loves using it for her ""exercises"" so she has inherited it.The pad is very well made and the handle and straps make it easy to roll up and carry around (my daughter loves that part too)."
4,Decent,"This is a good mat when you need a little cushioning for your floor exercises (like crunches and push-ups, not yoga etc.)."
4,Perfect for Traditional Sit Ups and Similar Exercises,"I bought this to take the discomfort away from doing sit-ups (etc.) on hardwood floors.The padding is ribbed for easy rolling and thick enough to cushion the knob of the lower back at the pelvis.The backing is a little to slippery, so I DO NOT recommend this to be used for stand up stretching a warm-up exercises on a smooth surface although it's fine on carpet.The one thing I like about it is that it has elastic loops to hold it together after it's rolled up and the web handle is an added convenience for carrying or hanging in the closet, etc.I think it's a bargain."
4,Deep Occultism,"This is a good introduction to the weird world of Michael Bertiaux. Unlike nearly all people writing about the occult MB actually practices what he is interested in, and the results can be disturbing. Most modern occultists, despite their interest in magick, don't really experience or believe in it. Therefore, their books are often long on theory, to convince themselves and their readers that they know what they are talking about, and short on real data. MB is the exception, which is one of the reasons Kenneth Grant has fastened on to him. he is the real thing, which makes his work provoking, difficult, irritating, and useful.His best material is in the ""Monastary of the 7 Rays"" courses, which extended over a 4 year period. The 5th year course is to be found, along with some introductary materials, in the much sought after ""Voudon Gnostic Workbook"" (now out of print). This book provides and interesting view of Bertiaux's system, and is worth the time and money."
5,Great Scaffolding!,I have two of these scaffolding units and they are very good for the money. They are especially good to use indoors where you can roll. I highly suggest getting the outriggers if you plan to own more than on set of these for stacking! Great item and a very good price!
2,Not challenging,"I just purchased the bun and thigh doer and it is not very challenging. I attached my ankle weights to the foot bars and still it is not difficult! I would get more from doing squats and lunges than from this machine! I wish I would have known this before purchasing. If you are in shape, at all, this is not a very good purchase. I'm thinking of whom I can give it to that might possibly get something out of it, because I am getting nothing."
2,What a mess of parts,"This thing arrived like it had accidently been shipped to Afganastan. The outside box was smashed big time and when I opened it all up it was like a jack in the box of parts all over. It did have instructions so I put it together and it was missing a couple of fastening pieces. I was able to score the missing parts at a local hardware store but it was such a mess to get together I just gave up on it. So it sits in my exercise loft gathering dust. I got so discusted with the time I put in to get it together that I have no interest in using it. This is something old too, the video comes on VHS."
1,Unhappy Camper,you have to be a beginner in order to get a work out with this thing. not enough tension in ropes.
2,Read Clayton Christensen's Books Instead,"This book covers much of the same ground that Clayton Christensen explored in his three revolutionary books: The Innovator's Dilemma, The Innovator's Solution, and Seeing What's Next. Truthfully, those books do a far superior job of explaining the dynamics of innovation in comparison to the performance of this book. Utterback does have very insightful comments on the standardization of product design, but outside of that section, the book is not particularly exemplary. For those interested in mastering the art of innovation, the game begins and ends with Clayton Christensen."
5,"Excellent information, eye-opening","Excellent job done by Mr. Utterback.I had this book for a class in master's degree. I was very impressed and found that it had a huge impact on me. I am not a reader, but found myself really engrossed in this book. One of the few ""textbooks"" that I still recommend to friends and family. It helped me understand investing too. I have an understanding now of when industries are mature and when they are still growing. Just wish I could see it before it happens. Then I would be a millionaire and thanking Mr Utterback, not writing this review :-)."
3,False Start,"A very light, superficial account of the new Browns. Terry Pluto is one of my favorite writers because he lacks any pretension, but I expected more from this book.There was obviously little heavy research that went into the story, other than a few interviews with the major players. The page count was fleshed out by dozens of only slightly interesting anecdotes from Browns' fans. Pluto also quoted liberally from his past columns.Pluto's done better, and I'm sure he knows it, too."
3,Run of the mill book as far as enjoyment value,"Basically the Browns:1) Weren't given enough time to prepare for their initial season;2) The expansion draft rules were < favorable than 1995;3) Carmen Policy had no frame of reference on running an expansion team and he was overrated because he fell into a good situation in SF where Walsh did all the heavy lifting;4) Dwight Clark was over his head as GM;5) Because of the short time before their initial season the candidate field for head coach was limited unless they wanted a college coach;6) Brain Billick didn't want to coach an expansion team, nor did any other perhaps better qualified coaches. The Browns were desperate for a head coach and tried to pressure Billick into the job;7) Because of the constraints placed on hiring other NFL assistant coaches, Chris Palmer's pool of NFL assistants was limited to coaches who had been fired from NFL jobs; and,8) Did some lousy drafting.That's just about it."
2,Okay read,"Sad to read this and this same situation still applies to my favorite football team, the Cleveland Browns. It was a nice read."
3,Perfect for the Kitchen,"Since it replaced a 6-inch B&W; TV with an analog tuner and no cable connection, it would not have taken much to be a major improvement. It exceeded our expectations, the price was excellent, the picture is very good and can be seen easily from 12-feet. It is great for a kithcen counter. It is on a small stand that keeps the screen about 4-inches above the clutter and splashes on the counter. It looks like it could be wall mounted also. It plugs directly into a standard receptacle without the use of a transformer.On the down side, the sound is very thin (but you get used to it)and that is the only reason to give it 3 stars instead of 5. The controls are on the right edge of the TV not visible from the front so I took me a while to find them and the labels are hard to read. Using the remote is the way to go so do not lose it."
5,"So far, so good!",I am thoroughly enjoying this book that was recommended to me by my counselor. I am learning about the shame-based family in which I was raised and how to break free from shame through God's grace.
4,"Review of ""Tired of Trying to Measure Up.""","I bought this book for a class I am taking at my church. I feel the material in this book is relevant to believers and non-believers alike. By using a mixture of biblical principles and modern psychology, Mr. VanVonderen explains why many people are stuck in the vicious cycle of give up/try hard and/or try harder. Using easy to follow diagrams and laymans terms this book does a very good job at explaining the process and why so many people suffer from extreme exhaustion from striving so hard and then giving up on hope that ones circumstances will ever change. The last half of the book describes how we heal and gives hope for the weary and a future full of rest in God's grace and comfort. I would recommend this book for other church groups and individuals who struggle with these issues."
3,Not bad but there are better choices,"Book is not bad but expensive. For a good general overview of what bankers and other people in an M&A deal do, take a look at my work, Deal Teams by Frankel."
4,A Nice Surprise,"The first story in this collection is outstanding, as are most of the stories in this book. I had some problems with the story devoted entirely to the father, and would have liked to have heard more from the brother after the first 1/4 of the book, especially as his interactions with Georgia were so touching and above all real . . . but this is definately a good read. It took me a day, and there were many little moments that were so good, I had to write them down for myself."
1,Hiss! They got this one totally wrong,"Remember the original X-Wing from 1977, the one that took the Tatooine Luke since that was the only Luke figure made at the time? Did you hate it like I did? The reason I hated it was, the nose was about 40% too short compared with the film. Why? Because they couldn't have a toy to scale, because they couldn't put it on store shelves. BOO! Well, this ship is apparently a replica of that old lame X-Wing, and the nose is way too short. Show Hasbro what we think of their poor design (I mean, the people designing these are obviously not fans themselves, probably haven't seen the films) by giving it the boot out of your shopping cart."
1,I did not realize,"I did not realize this toy was so badly designed untill I did read some reviews. Nose is too short, the botton engines are shorter than the top ones. furtunately they did write star wars correctly..........I hope."
4,"Some shortcomings, but a nice cross section of work....","Chogyam Trungpa is a controversial figure, however, he was certainly an excellent teacher and had a gift for explaining complex topics. His ability to explain the nature of mind and relate it to Western psychological thought comes across in lucid fashion. While this book does not represent a complete or comprehensive treatment, it certainly has a lot of value and it a good introduction to Buddhist psychology for anyone. It is like a buffet where you can sample and try on a lot of different ideas. If you develop an in-depth interest, there are other more detailed books by this author and many others."
4,Terrible Trail,After reading this book I would suggest it to who ever maybe doing family history (like me) or history research period. It is a good book and has some interesting stuff in it.
1,Wrong belt!,"They sent me the right packaging ,but the wrong belt. And it took three weeks to get here. This is the last and final time I order from amazon!"
3,Readable UK focused view of BMW M car production,"Good value for money, nice pictures and well written.On the downside it is UK focused (clearly not a disadvantage if you live in the UK) having only limited or incomplete coverage of non-UK cars. Also, technical specifications are high level and thus won't tell the enthousiast much that they don't already know. And chassis number ranges (which might help identify a 'real' M-car) are missing for many older cars."
2,Nicely illustrated but nothing exceptional in content.,"This is just another example of an automobile book written with an evident British slant. It is nicely illustrated, and entertainingly written, but for the American BMW enthusiast it leaves a lot to be desired. It is basically just a re-hash of information available elsewhere, with few, if any original insights."
3,Clever and interesting; poor lock construction,"This book and challenge held the interest of my then-seven-year-old son, Dimitri.I'm sorry to say that the lock construction is weak. After Dimitri solved the puzzle and got the lock open, all was well and he was able to reset the combination to something new. He swears he didn't use excessive force on it, but it now has three plastic pieces broken off from it (one latch, another latch, and the piece that indicates ""locked"" and ""unlocked"". This is especially inappropriate for an item designed to be used by children of this age.So, I'd give this a five-star rating, but I'm taking two points off for durability issues."
1,Not worth it,My son received this at Christmas. The lock was broken before he could crack the code. I purchased another because he was heartbroken. The second lock broke when he tried to change the code. We spent one weekend reading the stories and doing the puzzles and it was completely forgotten thereafter.
5,Gets better every day,"I bought this for my then six-month old daughter two months ago and at the time she was only interested in rolling over. It was fun for her to encounter all sorts of 'obstacles' and the mirror. Now she is sitting up and she loves the houses and trees. Just yesterday she used the mirror to test her balance by leaning all the way forward to see her face, then leaning backwards to an upright position. This was definitely worth the money!"
1,Poorly designed,"I bought this copy stand to replace an older plastic one that was broken. I'm sending this one back and applying duct tape to my old one to keep it going. As others have said, the clear plastic guide bar is completely useless. Yes, the stand holds 150 sheets, but you can only place one sheet of paper behind the bar! The bar does slide up & down, but you must push it so hard you think it's going to break. Not sure why the manufacture even bothered to put it on this stand.Do not waste your money on this product."
1,Not what I want ... will be returning it,"This typist stand is cheaply made, and it's plastic! For $20 I expected it to be metal. I wanted a metal stand, so I can actually use it to draw on/take notes. This is too flimsy! It says that there's a 150 sheet capacity, but I find that it's only good for 10 sheets+ at a time. When I use it with a book on there, it's really not built to be a book stand. I originally got this so I could use it to draw and trace with a book behind it. This isn't it! I'm sending it back."
5,Perfect,"I use one of these at work, and got one for using at home, since I work there too. Nice small footprint, doesn't take up a lot of space, and holds more than fifty sheets very well."
3,An interesting omission,"I've just finished browsing the book on line and having turned to the index,I find a puzzling omission: Vladimir Nabokov. Even if the author discounts translations from the Russian, Nabokov did translate into English and has an excellent (to my mind) article on the art of translation.I look forward to reading ""The Translator's Invisibility"" and hope that someone will follow up with a history of translations into Russian; for that is a country that has had translators since the tenth century.Not having read the book yet, I can give it only three stars, assuming that it'll be OK. If I find it better, I'll add a second review to update my estimation."
3,original Mech Assault was better.,"I was excited to get this game since I loved the first Mech Assault so much, but single player mode does not live up to its predecessor. The boss fights, which were non-existant in Mech Assault, were pretty cool, and very difficult. The game play overall was harder, and especially the mortar. When you are in battle suit mode, you have a shoulder-mounted heavy mortar that is very difficult to aim, and in the final boss fight, you need to aim precisely with it.Apparently this game really shines in when you are playing with other people online. There are not one, but TWO multiplayer modes. Unfortunately, I cannot get onto XBox live with a V1 X-Box, so I did not get to enjoy the multiplayer modes."
3,"Good Game. Works on Xbox 360, but not on live",Game works on the xbox 360. This was one of the old orig xbox titles I bought. Im glad I bought it. Cheap and fun.
2,Kathy Ireland- Total Fitness Workout,I wasn't too pleased with this DVD. If you are a beginner or need something very low impact than this DVD would be very good for you. Just wasn't what I expected and wasn't for me. I gave it to my grandmother who said she didn't even break a sweat.
3,My judgment on Hell,"The dialogue is a bit trite. For example, you have 13 year old lovers each speaking like... well, like despairing 19th century romantics alone in the privacy of their bathrooms. Clearly Barbusse was no master of dialogue. There are some inconsistencies and absurdities (in the ridiculous, not ""good"", sense) in the plot. However, this is well compensated for by the vivid description of the smallest details; instead of such a thing boring the reader, you find yourself anticipating when Barbusse will next describe the evening light on a cabinet, the formation of furniture, the casual setting of a cafe, etc. This book truly reads like a magnificent painting. Despite the 3 star rating (for reasons above), I highly recommend it."
2,Well written redundant voyeurism,"I really tried, but I just can't get into this book. The concept for it seemed the most interesting idea I had heard in a while. Actually reading it though, it comes across as very redundant situations that are overly detailed. I don't want to deter people from reading this, but if you're waiting for anything to happen, it doesn't. This is really more a book that is making a statement on humanity than a proper story of any kind."
3,An Existentialist Novel,"How can a novel be based on a man who peeps on other people through a hole in his apartment wall? Read this book to find out. The protagonist is an isolated man who presents a great many of the problems of modern existentialism in a nutshell. Colin Wilson used this book as the starting point for his ""Outsider"", and one can easily see why. The protagonist is a perfect example of the outsider. Unfortunately, he is not a particularly intelligent or perceptive outsider, and this detracts from the book. but on the whole, a great analysis of the human condition in the modern world."
5,"Classic, classic, story!","The little red hen finds some grains of wheat. ""Who will plant this wheat?"" cried the little red hen.""Not I,"" said the cat.""Not I,"" said the dog.""Not I,"" said the mouse.You should know how this turns out. After all, who hasn't read this story, The Little Red Hen?This edition of this old folk tale, illustrated by Paul Galdone, will not disappoint you. The patient little red hen quietly and effectively goes about her business. Will the cat, dog, and mouse ever learn?Well, I don't want to give the story away! You want to learn more? Pick up a copy of this slim book and read away... hopefully with a little kid sitting next to you!"
5,The Little Red Hen,This version is a classic one. The story and illustrations are very inviting for any child. I love the classic moral of the story too.
2,Won't work on many kindles,This only works on these kindles:Kindle FireKindle Fire HDKindle Cloud ReaderKindle for iPadKindle for Android.
3,i think he ripped off richard patrick hodgins@ you do recall,who i'm talking about here sandra bullock@late boyfriend unohedid
3,Littered with misprints,The book appears to have wonderful content and if the printing were up to snuff I would give it 4 or 5 stars. The copy I received (and returned) was printed only a few days before I purchased it. There are many words that have a letter replaced by a white space. At first I thought I could ignore them even though there were 5 to 10 per page. Then I found that every missing letter was interrupting my concentration on the material. I find Bayesian statistics difficult enough to understand without viewing the material through a botched print job.
5,Lego Soccer,"This is a great game. I was really exited when the LEGO Soccer sets first came out. I got the Championship Challenge 1 and loved it.#1 took forever to build and was pretty easy to break, but #2 is supposed to be more durable. Overall, this is a great set and I would reccomend buying it to any lego fan, even if you don't like soccer."
5,Aptly titled,"If you like the solo piano genre of music made popular by Windham Hill and Narada, you'll like Lucid Dreams. It features a varity of moods all of which are conducive to dreaming. It's very relaxing. Great after a long stressful day."
4,A very comprehensive book,"This is the first time I use Vasta' book on Child Psychology for the course on Developmental Psychology I give at the American University of Beirut. The semester just finished, and I can say this book was extremely enriching for me (I am a clinical psychologist), especially the parts on the bio-ecological perspective, and the sections on cross-cultural research. The one part I found a bit ""exhausting"" was the chapter on language development, perhaps because it is not my specialty ! I am looking forward to the 4th edition. I would also very much like to be in touch with Dr Vasta because I am currently working on a study of Personality Characteristics of First - Borns in Lebanon, using a cultural approach. I also wish to thank Wiley for sending me the 2004 catalogue of Psychology, Life and Medical Sciences Student Texts (that is how I found out about Vasta's 4th edition). My students (a majority of Psychology majors) also enjoyed his book."
4,A former student comments,"I utilized the second edition of this book while studying under Dr. Vasta at SUNY Brockport. This book, along with his teachings gives insight into the various steps that a child goes through in becoming aware of his or her surroundings and growth."
1,Nothing really biblically based here,"The biggest problem with this book is it doesn't really use scripture to prove the author's beliefs, which really amount to any consensual sex is approved, even when it's sex outside of the marriage partnership. A lot of suppositions are made about why the Bible forbids adultery (lack of condoms and birth control) but the author does nothing to prove his case. However, I pretty much gave up trying to find any truth in the author's beliefs when, attempting to justify wife-swapping, he asks, wouldn't it be a sin NOT to share ones wife if they both want to explore sex outside of their marriage? Really? A sin not to commit adultery? Sigh."
1,Unbiblical,Unfortunately this book has no foundation. The author is lacking in credibility and is a member of several forums that exploit people. The central message of the bible is love and the central message of this author is exploitation. A shame that this was ever printed.
3,Not up to Pratchett's usual standards.,I am a devotee of Terry Pratchett's writings. But Strata is a bit heavy handed. Cover is the best part.
3,Alright product... cheap case...I got what I paid for it,"Not to say this is a bad product but if one wants hole saw cutting ability without paying alot of money, this kit has most of the standard sizes of hole saws with two bits (one for accessing smaller hole saws) to work with.The case can be a bit better and I do understand the oily mess upon opening it. The hole saws themselves will jiggle about because there isn't a sure solid way of putting them in the case."
3,"Really cheap, but cheaper in stores","These hole saws are incredibly cheap, in quality and in price, but that's fine as long as you are going for very light occasional use, which is exactly what I bought them for.I was a bit disappointed when I walked into a Harbor Freight and saw the exact same set of tools for quite a bit cheaper. Even so, I can't say they are overpriced at $13.50"
5,Excellent! Extremely high value for the money!,"I ordered these hole saws to drill a 4"" hole in some particle board and I could not be happier. I had been shopping around to buy just one 4"" hole saw and the prices were ridiculous, around $50. I found this online and could not believe how many different sizes come it. The only real difference is that the $50 saws are deeper. The saws that come with this set are about 1"" deep which was plenty for what I was trying to do and I didn't want to pay $50 for something I was going to use maybe a couple times."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Seller shipped the item very quickly, but upon arrival I found out that it wasn't compatible with my machine. It was clearly from another country and for whatever reason didn't work with my plotter. I guess that's what I get for going for the lowest price."
3,Misery love company,"Card is an excellent writer, but far too many of his books are about gifted and sensitive children living in misery. This one spreads the misery to pretty much everyone in the book, and by the end I was just glad to have it over."
2,Meh,"It was deep, complicated, interwoven, interesting.All of these are plusses.It is quite different from Cards' other books though, not really what I was expecting. It's a decent book though."
3,Different,"Hart's Hope isn't your typical Card novel. He keeps the philosophy to a minimum, choosing instead to tell a story.It's not a great story. It's decent. It's all a little weird."
2,"Decent story in its broad strokes, but gross and/or boring in the details","I'm quite fond of Card's work, and this is perhaps the 15th book of his I've read. I picked it up with no foreknowledge of the book at all. And I found it rather disappointing.The basic story is simple, somewhat interesting. The setting too. I read the wikipedia summary of the story and liked it. My main gripe with the book was its fixation on the naked human body, sex, pooping, and peeing. I suspect Card's goal was to write as a character who lacked a modern reader's distaste for these things, but it all struck me as unnecessary and, well, distasteful. And there's nothing else terribly redeeming about the book. It lacks the characterization and dialogue that I've enjoyed in other Card books. It's my least favorite work of his that I've read so far."
4,Card's Hart Fantasy almost Fantastic,"I guess all pales compared to the Ender's series. Card is my favorite sci-fi/fantasy writter because he creates amazing visions of new worlds. I found this one a bit less than tremendous, but still a fantastic endeavor. There were a number of fairly slow spots, but he was able to weave these back into the story. But I still feel that he spent too much time on the initial visit into the city, though purposeful in the end. In any case, I enjoyed the story but still could not give it a full 5 stars."
5,A Strong Modern Yet Classic Fairy Tale,"This book was a complete surprise. I have been reading Orson Scott Card for about the last 15 years, but this amazing little book is quite a wonderful departure.""Hart's Hope"" reminds me of a classic, non-politically correct fairy tale with violence, magic and allegory. Underlying the story are the questions of what is good and evil as well as the power of words and the wonder of making and unmaking. These are classic themes but expressed in such a strong inventive voice.Since this book is a pretty quick read, I am actually considering going back and re-reading this because I was really intrigued with the way Card plays with the different religions and Gods who are so real in the world of this novel that they have their own faults.This is a fantasic fantasy read, unlike anything I have read in quite some time and very different from anything from OSC. Highly suggest this one."
2,not good,"Very low budget J-horror. I usually prefer smaller movies with good stories instead of fancy effects with bad stories. But in my opinion this was not much of a story, nor was it acted/directed well.IMDB doesn't even have a page for it. I tried searching by director (Takaaki Ezura) and the lead actors (Hikaru Kawamura, Mikio Sato) to no avail.My time would have been much better spent rewatching Cure, A Tale of Two Sisters, Spider Forrest etc."
3,not as good as the first time,"this toys is a reproduction of Darth Vader's battle dammaged tie fighter from the death star playset in action fleet from a few years ago. However, all the action fleet repro's don't come with the 1-inch poseable figures they originally came with, which is a let-down, but the vehicles are still cool."
4,had fun at Christmas,"Bought this for my sister for X-mas. We played it that night. Some of it was quite easy, while some were stumpers. You'd really have to know the genre to get into the game."
3,not had enought for a real music fan,"If your a BIG music fan and already know a lot about music this game will not challange you in the least. I found that I enjoyed playing it but found that it was far to easy for me. If your like me and enjoy a good challenge, this game isn't for you."
3,I miss Dick,"While the son Felix can catch most of his father's style, there is still enough missing that was unique to Dick Francis. In this book, we once again find ourselves in the world of British horse racing. Our hero misses his career as a jockey that was cut short by a broken neck. As a financial adviser, he's mixed up in something that he can't figure out. His work mate is murdered at his side, and other people die suspiciously. [This part is classic Francis flair.]The love story is where I think we have a slip. Our hero isn't as dashing as the usual hero. He makes up for it, but this part of the story just doesn't shine for me."
5,"Dick Francis Can Scare, Entertain, and Educate at the Same Time","Francis might not be in the class of Eric Ambler in terms of plot intricacies, but he's pretty close. And Francis has the happy facility for taking real people and putting them in (as the title says) danger. His characters always survive the danger, but it's nonetheless real. How they survive is always suspenseful and entertaining. He likes horses and happy endings, and I bet those preferences are connected. Everyone looks good on a horse, and almost every horse is beautiful. I am glad that we have Dick Francis's son Felix to carry on the tradition while giving it a slightly edgier feel."
2,old school,"not sure if anyone... here it is, I got it because a friend on face reminded me of it, could not remember reading it, got it, and read on a plane, oh yeah, walking down the ramp, I remember now, was sensational, the refrence to weed, and the first story, fourty years ago... but in all, not all that earth shattering. I would recomend Rabbit Boss before this, this is barley a blip, maybe as historical ref. Rabbit books: Watership Downs, and Rabbit Boss, read those instead, and stay sober."
5,Very inspiring and full of ideas,"This book is fantastic! It's fun and very enlightening to read about Mr. Wilhelm's experiences as a junior high literature teacher. He has a firm grasp of contemporary reader-response theories and provides dozens of great project ideas for teaching literature to adolescents. I do a lot of empirical research into young adult reading patterns, and this book is full of inspiration and ideas. It is a valuable resource for both university students and English/ ESL teachers, as well as a well-written sory about one teacher's life in the literature classroom. Excellent!"
1,This thing has real problems,"Ok, I installed it and it worked flawlessly with WEP. Then I went on the road and again it worked flawlessly connecting to a public wi-fi without WEP. When I got home, with the same configuration as a week earlier it wouldn't connect. It either tells me the WEP key is incorrect (which I know it's not as I had another machine that connected just fine) or that the WEP key must be ten characters (which it doesn't). I even installed it on an other laptop and it gave the same error. And, I put the other laptop's card in and it connects just fine.Also, it likes to think that the 64bit WEP key MUST be ten characters long, which it does NOT.The real conundrum is why it worked fine under WEP and then stopped working. I am stumped.Also, I did a Google search for the error message it gives and I find a half a dozen postings on various boards with the same problem."
1,"MN-720 doesn't work, per Microsoft","I bought MN-720 adapter & MN-700 basestation. Basestation seems OK but adapter never worked. I have new HP desktop and new HP laptop and XP Home. Microsoft ""Research Team"" informed me, after 2nd tech call in a week, that the MN-720 has KNOWN (they know!) problems with NO FIX and they recommend I get their USB version(!!). I spent 10 hours (8 myself, 2 with Msoft tech people)trying various settings, etc. to no avail. The SECURITY software seems at fault per Microsoft. The adapter ""physically"" gets strong signals but ""logically"" will not connect at all. What a waste of 10 hours on a plainly, obviously defective product that shouldn't be on store shelves. If yours doesn't work in the firs 5 minutes with the standard install just return it for another brand, save time."
2,Poor Support,"This device installs nicely on a plug-and-play-ready XP system, but heaven help you if things don't go smoothly: I went to install the device on another machine which apparently doesn't have the drivers preinstalled (odd, since it's brand new). Went to find the drivers on Microsoft's site and, after clicking through the usual twenty screens required to actually find something there, wound up being told to ""contact the manufacturer."" A typical Microsoft customer experience. Is it too much work to maintain a driver library in a convenient place?"
3,"Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't","I just got the MN-720 and the MN-700 Basestation. I upgraded from the old 802.11b Microsoft basestation and MN-520 wireless card. Using the MN-720, after a while, it will say it's connected and everything looks great, but I have zero network available to me. From what i have read and heard, it seems to be a driver issue. The mn-520 worked great but the 720 is not proving to be as solid. Hopefully they will get new drivers out quickly."
2,Blue Screens of Death!!!,"Running Windows XP Pro with every available patch and all the latest drivers, and this card crashes my system (infamous blue screen of death) several times each day. I had predicted that this card would be 100% compatible and very stable ... foolish wishful thinking on my part I guess.I'm about to give up on this MN-720 and switch to the Lucent/Agere/Proxim Orinoco 11b card that I've been using for years without ANY problems.I know this must be a driver issue, but I don't have the time or patience to pursue MS support for this, I'd rather just chalk it up to a loss and learn from the experience.If you don't have time to waste troubleshooting, stay away from this card!!!"
1,The worst wireless card ever,"Alright before I begin let me just say I know quite a bit about wireless networking. I had already connected 2 wireless pc's to my 128 bit WEP encrypted router. I had initially set it up as WPA but opted to change it as this hunk of junk doesn't support WPA. This card will detect your network no problem, just try connecting to it. Apparently I am typing in the wrong WEP pass.... I can assure you I am not. Perhaps there is an issue between Micro$oft and D-link I am unaware of...go figure. I do not have the time nor patience to deal with Micro$oft's customer support regarding this issue. Back to the store this goes. Do yourself a favour and do not buy this."
1,Compatibility Issues Galore,"Won't connect to a Dlink router under WEP? C'mon, the other 3 devices we have do, and we sure as heck didn't have to change the router settings - and of course it was the routers fault, never MS! I gave this failed installation about one hour's work, then decided that other products worked without any hassle, and took this back to the store.I'm normally a MS fan (yes, they exist), and I'll agree that their decision to exit the wireless market is probably a good thing, if this crap is what they (or their 3rd-party vendor) are turning out."
1,"Horrible card, bad signal","I rate this card 1-star. It has a weak signal. Where Netgear saw 6 networks this carrd saw zero. I had trouble making it see my two routers. Changing channels and searching for the right one helped at one time. But I tried it recently, and it just couldn't find my wireless router on any channels. (the laptop was very near the router) So I replaced it with netgear and all was fine. Was a cheap move on my part to buy this one in the first place. Not that cheaper always means worse, just in this case it did."
3,Durability issues,"Quite frankly it was a lovely little card thats sleek and easy to use, it ran the connection at my school really nicely the only thing thats bugging me now is that it's a year later and it went and died. Like the Power supply won't even turn on, and it's not the slot in my computer. So I called Microsoft and they told me this item has been discontinued and I have to send it in and they will have to send me a refund instead of a replacement."
1,"An interesting-looking, but useless, blinking bit of plastic","Microsoft has never failed to disappoint me, (I suppose there is something to be said for consistency) and this carries on that somewhat dubious tradition. I bought this with a the MN-700 wireless router, and both worked fine for a couple weeks. However, they both conspiratively proceeded to stop functioning. This card was the most maddening of the pair, because it would find the wireless network every once in a while, yet refuse to connect. I've tried every channel, and made sure its on infrastructure mode, but it still refuses to work. I suppose I deserve it, though, expecting that a microsoft wireless card would connect to a microsoft wireless router with a microsoft operating system. Do yourself a favor and buy your wireless networking from a decent company that has some expertise in networking, like Linksys or Belkin. Whatever you do, give as little money as possible to this shoddy company."
2,Not happy,"I have been using wireless for a while, and recently purchased the whole kit, base station with ethernet and the 720 card. I am using the notebook card in a HP Laptop, and keep getting popped off line every few minutes for no reason(it just happened again) No body seems to be able to help me with this and I am about to throw the HP out. (Pisspoor customer service)I need to use it for checking my e-mail on the road, and my wireless orinoco antenna work marvelous, never drops me(ooops, just happened again) I can't even get any help from Microsoft, as they insist it's an HP issue. HP insists (Happened again) that its a Microsoft problem. That's it, pass the buck! For anyone with HP or compaq, get rid of the crap and get Dell. My Dell has been online since November, without a single dropped connection."
3,Worth buying used & less than $20,"Lovely pictures, and the book does a good job of keeping things diverse and multi-cultural. As some have criticized, the pictures are often of sumptuous, very expensive weddings, however.The advice is down to earth and useful for anyone. I found several excellent hints for a home ceremony & reception that I wouldn't have thought of on my own.I bought my copy used for $..., and I think it was well worth it. If you can find a used copy under $20, I recommend it. New at the full price near $...? A waste of money, I think."
4,Down to earth,"A very useful friendly format. Sensible suggestions. To make the occasion even more special, I used the wedding song in Defenders of the Holy Grail by Agori. The music is available through Elfstone Publishing"
5,Awesome!!!!,"Hey man. Let me tell you that this book is freaking great. I was stunned and amazed the first time I read it, and it GETS BETTER EVERY TIME!!! This lady Celia is like the best author ever."
1,Don't waste your money,"This game is a waste of money. It could be a lot of fun, except the instructions for some of the activities are inadequate and require guesswork. Navigation using the remote's arrow keys is useless. We have three dvd players, with one of them brand new, and I couldn't get past the Quidditch end-of-year challenge, despite literally 20 tries. It didn't matter which arrow I pushed, at what time, anything. I also was unable to direct the owl flying through the trees during one of the extracurricular activities. And sometimes the game just did what it wanted, with me not pressing anything on the remote. Now I have to figure out how to return the darn thing to Target, what with it opened and all. Once the packaging is open, they'll only do an exchange for the same item and I definitely don't want it!"
1,"Badly designed, overpriced","This game is terrible. It is essentially a bunch of clips from all the Harry Potter movies mixed with painfully easy games. It would probably be fun for young children but since the movie was rated PG-13 I was expecting something a bit harder. Actually, the only challenging part of the game was getting the remote to do what you want. I would expect this low quality if it was a special feature that came with a movie, but not from something you have to pay the cost of the DVD for."
1,Impossible to get through,"So far, I've tried the game on the DVD player and in the computer. Our DVD player is 6 years old, so I thought maybe it wasn't ""modern"" enough. Then I switched to the computer, and the same problem with the arrows not working at all, as another reviewer mentioned. I'm going to try it on my newer DVD player, but if that doesn't work I'm going to return it."
1,Juvenile,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas -- he's a huge playstation 2 fan -- and he didn't like it at all. Said it was silly, useless, and just way too easy. Meant for young children, not adults, or even gaming teenagers."
4,My daughter loves it!,My daughter is 7 1/2 and loves this game. Its pretty easy to use. The graphics are good. I enjoy playing it with her too. You can have up to 4 players
1,"Great idea, but poor performance","The idea behind this trivia game is great. Our family enjoyed playing the first parts of the game which worked. But when the game requires you to use the remote control to direct your broom in a Quidditch match (or other things), it will not work. We tried with several DVD players and we were not able to make it work."
2,Remote makes a difference,"I was actually very disappointed in this Harry Potter DVD game - it says all you need is to use the TV remote but I can't get past the beginning stages of the Quittach bonus or if the owl if flying... no matter what I did it was the same outcome. They need to give better instructions on how to manipulate through the games - especially if they want people to actually keep buying and playing it.I don't know mine could be defective... but, portions of the DVD works and others I can't even get started on."
1,HARRY POTTER INTERACTIVE DVD GAME,"HEY! THIS GAME IS FOR YOU, WELL THAT IS IF YOU WANT TO FEEL UTTERLY STUPID AND EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED.I OWN A NEW SONY DVD PLAYER. IF YOU CAN GET PAST YEAR ONE IN THE QUIDDICH CHALLENGE, I AM SERIOUSLY IMPRESSED.AND DON'T FORGET TO TRY THE YEAR ONE EXTRA-CURRICULAR FLYING OWL ACTIVITY. THAT POOR BIRD DIES EVERY TIME.I DON'T THINK THIS GAME WAS TESTED THOROUGHLY BEFORE IT WAS PAST ON TO THE UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. REALLY.WELL, UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BE UTTERLY FRUSTRATED!"
2,Not worth it maybe,"Unfortunately being a huge fan of the HP series, I must say this game isn't up to the hype it gets. The DVD is very hard to play because all you use is your dvd remote. I try getting past the levels but for some reason I feel like the game does not pickup the signal everytime I press a button on my remote. I tried getting past the same level for about 20 minutes but gave up. I dont think this is worth it, hard to figure out."
1,Harry Potter Interactive DVD Game-Hogwarts Challenge,"The software is very buggy and am unable to use remote control on any of our computers, dvd players,etc. I will return if cannot get directional arrows to work during Quiddich challenge and Owl's flying. The game itself appears to be for very young children and not for anyone over 10 or so. Teenagers and adults find questions, etc very simple and unchallenging. Besides, the controls do not respond as written in booklet. Will most likely return. Very disappointed."
3,My Harry Potter Interactive DVD Game Review,"Well, this wasn't quite what I hoped it would be but it's a pretty good game. I played it a couple times and will play it again."
2,Poor Response,"I admit it, when I first saw this game, I thought it looked awesome. I went searching for it in DVD stores and eventually found it. As soon as I first started playing I was let down. Hogwarts Challenge promises that you go through the life of being a Hogwarts student by getting sorted, earning House Points, playing Quidditch, and dueling. These elements are barely present. Instead, you get a handful of mini-games that either involve memory or quick-time events, the latter of which is practically broken because poor response from the remote. Sadly, that's really all there is to this Interactive DVD Game. What's ironic is that on the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban DVD, there is a knight's quest game in the bonus features that is much better than this piece of junk. Avoid this."
3,Good game.,"My granddaughter (age 8) was able to play this game to the finish. She is very persistent and patient but finally completed the game. I was pleased at this because after reading other reviews, it didn't sound too promising. I almost did not purchase it because of the reviews but we are both glad that I did eventually get it."
1,Do not buy,"Despite the bad reviews, my son wanted this DVD, so I bought a used one. It is horrible. The controls do not work and it is impossible to get past the first year. Your child will be frustrated."
4,my 4yr old loves it,My 4yr old son loves Harry Potter. He has enjoyed the game. Can play by himself or with his sisters thanks to the solo or multi player option.
1,Frustrating Game!!,"My husband is a huge Harry Potter fan so I thought this would make a great present---WRONG! Like many of the others who reviewed this game thee seems to be no way past the Quiddich Match or flyig the owls through the forest...no matter what button we push, or when you simply die. I was greatly disappointed in this game and think it was a huge waste of my money"
1,Total waste of money...,"We purchased this game for the kids for Christmas. They played with it for about 15 minutes. The games are clearly for the 3 to 4 year old set, but this was not clear when I made the purchase. Be thankful that as of today 12/25/04 the game is unavailable. [...] please do not stock this game! It was terrible. We also purchased Atari classic 10 games in one and the Ms. Pac-Man 5 games in one, and they were great!"
2,Can you say sell out?,"Inspector have made a mainstream masterpiece! (note the sarcasm)... their debut album ""Blanco y Negro"" was a great 2-tone ska record, adored by rudies, punks and skinheads throught out the U.S., Mexico and Latin America. But what we have here with ""Alma en Fuego"" is a pop-rock record with a few up stroke guitar parts and some horns. There are 2 good songs on this album ""Amnesia"" and ""Amargo Adios"" (which was visciously murdered by the ""Version Tequila""). ""Rudeboy Stomper"" was false advertising, and ""Cara de Chango"" just [is not good.] The rest of the album is so mediocre that I can't remember anymore of it! I would recommend this if you're into Shakira, Nek, Lou Vega and the rest of that ""latin pop rock"" mess."
2,small,"This simply wasn't what I expected. Shipped timely, returned easily - no problems. But the description was vague and unclear. The product was durable - but TINY. Super small. I returned it without any difficulty - and that I appreciate."
4,Shatter Your Skull Like Glass,"Oh Yeah!!!This is what happens when you play too much Dungeons and Dragons and mom buys you a guitar to encourage you to ""make some new friends"". This is what happens when Mastodon meets Slayer and gets regurgitated on a harcover copy of Finch's Mythology. This is what happens when an amp is pushed so far that the knobs melt into smoking blobs of stinking black tar, and it's oscillating waves of distortion create a huge shockwave blowing down houses in a 1/2-mile radius, bursting the eardrums and liquefying the internal organs of all hapless onlookers. The heaviest, most abrasive, and most FUN metal album I've heard in years. + 4 flaming broadsword not included....."
5,It's the best!,"Richard Brestoff discusses acting brilliantly and tells what we REALLY should know about acting in front of a camera and on a set/location for television/movie acting. This book was by far the most interesting, helpful, informative piece of literature about acting I've ever been so lucky to get my hands on! I only wish I could thank him personally."
1,Stick with the cubes,"I have both the cubes and the longer versions (double cubes). I have had them since college. The cubes and the non-drawer double cubes are great and versatile. The double length drawer though is problematic. I use it as a printer stand on end. This is due to a slight bowing of one of the longer pieces of wood. The bowing prevents the drawer from properly closing and if you manage to get it closed, can lock the drawer in place. This is probably due to the length of the board and the close fit of all the pieces. All the other cubes have been great (even the non-drawer double cubes) and have weather well for the cost."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I agree with the other reviews; the cubes without drawers by this company are great. This? Not so much.The plastic pieces the drawers slide on just will not go into the pre-drilled holes. Upon getting them in as far as I could, I put the drawers in. I figured the leverage would push the plastic into the holes the rest of the way. Boy was I wrong!. The side pieces actually split on the back corners.$80 bonfire material.Stick with the regular cubes.P.S. What is up with the shipping on these? The packaging wasn't even held together. One end of the box was completely hanging loose and the paper ""support"" material was dangling out. (Amazon's shipping box, not the product's box)"
3,Works but not much else,Relatively easy to put together. Not the best quality but what do you expect for the price. Works for what I need it to. Not recommended for storing anything remotely heavy.
2,You get what you pay for sometimes.......,"The $2999.00 sale price at Fry's Electronics made this one hard to resist. We knew that some reviews mentioned on the Internet stated that there were red hue problems in the flesh tones. Those concerns turned out to be true. Faces were way too red, making news anchor-people look like they had been out in the sun too long. We really did not want to return it for the price was great compared to others we had seen in this size range. We just could not tolerate it considering the amount of money demanded for this type of television, so it was returned."
3,Laser Eyes needed,This is the first weight lifting book I have ever attempted to read. Good Stuff! One question though...Could the print be any smaller? I will have a tough time getting through the entire thing without a magniifying glass. I am wearing my reading glasses. I have never seen a book with such fine print and lots of empty space on each page.
4,A standard work in vegetation ecology,"This is a standard in the discipline of vegetation ecology and probably the best introductiion to the field. This is a thoroughly revised new edition of the original book from 1986. It is a good introduction to the various methods available for analysis of vegetation data, like correspondence analysis, principle components analysis and regression analysis. A good point about this book is that consistently works with the same example dataset for explaining all different analysis methods. This clearly shows the differences in outcome of the different methods. A bad point is that its not always written very clearly and includes some very theoretical parts."
2,Just OK,"I really had high hopes for this album. However, I was really disappointed. The songs are fine, but it is much more of a ""performance"" than a ""worship"" album. It is hard to even hear the thousands who were present. This is probably due to a poor job of miking the audience. However, it gives the impression that there aren't many present and those who are present really aren't into the worship.If you want a wonderful ""LIVE"" worship album, you would do better to buy either Michael W. Smith ""Worship"" or Third Day ""Offerings""."
2,Talent,"From the title, I thought this CD contained 20 hits of the Hermanos Carrion when in fact it is a mixed of bands.These bands had talent but lacked good musical direction. Nevertheless, for the period they recorded, late 50's into the 60's the songs were popular with the teens.You can enjoy."
4,Bulliet Gets It,"I must point out, I am only half-way through the book but still feel qualified to add a few words here, right of future edits witheld of course.Bulliet brings a very fresh view and analysis to the history of interaction of Islam and Christianity and most importantly distinguishes it from the more fundemantal interaction of East and West, which so many scholars have failed to grasp time and again.His writing is efficient, incorporates much quantitative analysis and demonstrates a much deeper understanding of the subject matter than many other talking heads who are busily spouting sound bites for the masses.He goes beyond ""what went wrong"" and asks and tries to answer the ""why""?I am not sure if he is really making a case for an Islamo-Christian civilization, but it is certainly important to note as he does, the common roots and institutions between these two so-called opposing world views."
4,Updated classic,"The rival book to this one originally wasChaos: Making a New Science. The reason the Peterson book is better is that he covers more than Gleick who has limited his scope to fractals and chaos.In this new expanded version he has added some updates about what has happened since 1988.Ivars Peterson is one of the best mathematics popular writers alive today.His map of Mathland is right out of a fantasy novel.If you want to give your college student something that will help him grasp the problems of modern mathematics, this would be a very good starting book."
2,Not for beginners,I have finished about 5 different chapters for a Masters degree course I am taking. This book is not for beginners! I am an RN and have been working in business for 10 years. The author assumes that you have had basic accounting and the terminology is unfamiliar. There are very few examples given so it is hard to take the information and see how it is really used. I have had to buy another book just so that I could understand this book.
3,another fine book by Mr. Kelly,As all I have read this was no exception. Tom has a great gift for sharing stories on the wild turkey. If you are a turkey nut as I am this is a must for you book shelf.
1,Horrible,"These cards are just plain horrible. Not only are they expensive for flash cards but they are not useful at all. Using flash cards as a form of study for the ACT is just dumb. You are better of with a book and a good tutor. These cards are only good for a quick review a few days before the test, but I don't thinkb $ is worth it. The english cards might be useful because it points out a few grammer tips. The math cards might help you with a few concepts such as the midpoint formula and the quadratic formula. The science reasoning cards and the reading cards are stupid. They just point out hints and stragegy. They don't actually give you practice questions (except maybe 1 or 2 poor example questions). But take my word, there are books out there that will help you learn and practice for the ACT better then flash cards."
1,Not very good,Cards really do nothing more than take the bold-faced words from your math textbook. They do not show the student how the ACT might test the concept.
5,A Magical Read !,"""The Magical Crone"" is really a deeply moving book, not only for those of us women who are a bit older, but for young women who also recognize the power of the Crone inside of them. Reif and Haleff see the Crone as containing Maiden-Mother-and Crone, and so all of the powers of the Great Goddess triune are hers. Here is a view that sees women as increasing in power as each day passes by. I love this.Resource information includes some history of the Crone, a great review of Goddesses, Dark, and Wise and Magical, wonderful Wise Woman Crafts, Crone Symbols, Rituals and Meditations and so on. The info on herbs, herb gardens, and incenses were of special interest to me, and the chapter on Wise Blood really grounded me in the awareness of my Crone Power.By the way, the cover is really spectacular. I swooned over it for a bit ! Don't miss this terrific book, its a treasure."
4,Check out the ritual..Crone Zone,"My favorite thing: toward the end of the book there is a great group ritual titled 'The Crone Zone'. I experienced it with a group of women and I really recommend it. It addresses the Crone's power, talent and wisdom within every woman. In a later part of the rite each woman enters Hecate's cave and a personal rite of power is done. Death is faced and yet the immortality of the soul is affirmed. There is a magical drink made in a central cauldron, with the blessings of each woman contributed to the elixir. Then, we 'drank' the combined blessings. I found this group rite to be very empowering. That night, everyone that was present said fairwell with a smile on their faces. Still feel the glow."
5,Dave Rickard is the author,"This is a great little book of tunes. I've owned a copy for years and learned many tunes from it. It includes the classic ""A Glass of Beer"", a very Irish sounding ""Johnny Cope"" and several great slow airs and marches. But the person who compiled and arranged the tunes is Dave Rickard, not Susan MacQuaid."
5,A very good read,"As an engineer with McDonnell, I had the pleasure of working briefly with Pete and Dick Gordon when they came to St. Louis for the final testing of their Gemini 11 spacecraft before it was shipped to the Cape. He was quite a character and fun to be around. I felt quite sad when I heard he had died.I was very excited when I heard this book was being written, and I wasn't disappointed. It is an easy and gripping read, and the short chapters allow you to pause frequently without losing continuity. Despite the previously mentioned factual/historical errors, this is an excellent insight into a real space hero. Hope they make a movie out of it."
2,Pete Conrad deserves better,"This book is poorly written tripe that 14 year olds would love. Everyone older should save their money for much better books like ""First Man"", and ""Carrying the Fire"".Lots of misinformation, BS, made up stories, along with a dearth of details makes this book more like pulp fiction.It's too bad because Pete Conrad was an exceptional pilot, astronaut, and entrepreneur with a unique sense of humor. He deserves better, much better than this garbage."
2,Official AMERICAN biography,"Not a bad book, interesting to discover the man. Some good points but some week, as well. Some macho comments and some really distasteful. For example: ""When Vladimir Komarov augered in a month later out on the Siberian plain, stopping the Russian space program..."". And some more. Pitty, it could have been a better book."
5,Given as a gift,I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend. He has not had time to read it yet. Sorry.
3,Good but light on details.,"This is a good read, but in many cases I was left wanting a bit more info. The book is light on detail on pretty much every aspect of his career.There's certainly not a lot of detail about Conrad's spaceflights. Having said that, it is one of the few astronaut autobiographies that gives reasonable focus to the pre and post-NASA career.Serious followers of the space program will pick up a few errors of fact, which is sloppy and shouldn't have made it to print (eg the ""Max Peck"" story), and it's fair to say ""A Man on the Moon"" by Andrew Chaikin tells the story of Apollo 12 far better than this book.""Rocketman"" is worth a read, but it's not the best astronaut book going around."
1,"Lite-stuff ""Right Stuff""","I'm wondering if all the high reviews here are for the fascinating figure who was Pete Conrad and not this wince-inducing biography.This is a fast read, and good thing it went by so quickly. Sadly, the best things about it are the cool cover photo and Buzz Aldrin's introduction. The writing style is obnoxious, a styrofoam imitation of ""The Right Stuff."" The author (who is also responsible for giving the world the horrendous ""Space Cowboys""-- should've known) attempts to imitate Wolfe's style with absolutely none of his wit and creativity. Packed with cliches, factual errors, and cutesy-pie plays on words, ""Rocketman"" is a huge disappointment. I'm glad I borrowed this from a friend and didn't buy this cardboard knockoff."
2,Enormously Dissapointing,"Pete Conrad had a fairly colorful style about him, part cowboy - part engineer - full time iconoclast. However, these traits do not come thru in this book. The writing does not convey the dynamics of the man, so ultimately it becomes little more than a 'just the facts' biography.While I doubt any astronaut book came come close to capturing the human story of space Michael Collins' ""Carrying The Fire"", this book had a chance since it focused upon one of the truly unique characters in the space program. So am immensely dissapointed at the final product."
4,Rocketman Rocks,"I'm not much for reading biographies but I genuinely enjoyed this one. I felt that I understook this person on so many different levels and grew a greater appreciation for the lives of those in the space program.I found the book so enjoyable to read, the story was great as was the writing style. I can highly recommend it.What an amazing feat it must have been to have succeed in such a career! This made even more challenging for anyone with dyslexia. Pete Conrad is clearly a role model in so many ways."
4,a classic; McKay is worth your time,"After reading an issue of Black Issues Book Review, I decided to give this book a try. It is a great story and perfectly relays all the nuances and moods that are New York. The main character meets a prostitute named Felice his first night in Harlem and his quest for her begins there. Try this one out; you will enjoy"
4,Just what I expected!!!,Arrived within the scheduled date. The smell is a little strong for me but I like it. Wanted to use it on by baby for eczema but I'll rather use fragrance free soap and use this on myself.
5,A Blt From The Past,"My husband remembered watching ""Have Gun Will Travel"" when he was a kid. He had looked for some episodes of this western he could afford. You filled the bill. We thank you and hope you enjoyed selling the tape as much as we enjoyed buying it."
5,A Must Read,"I highly recommend the reading of this book to anyone experiencing a struggle in communicating to their spouse, co-worker, child, church member, pastor, etc. It has helped me understand clearly how to best assess how to effectively communicate with other personalities. It has helped me understand not only how others think, but more importantly how I percieve things, strengths and weaknesses, blind spots, etc.in my own life. I guarantee within a short time you will easily relate to the personality types identified, whether it be your own or someone you know. After becoming familiar with its content and purpose, if approached honestly and openly, it can drastically enhance your ability to relate to those in which you may now struggle."
1,piece of junk,"It is a piece of junk, not only ugly in appearance, but the picture quality is worse than our 20 year old 27 inch model. My wife and I would love to throw it out, but since we just bought it, we are stuck with it for awhile. We have been letting it sit while we go to watch the older,smaller model. If anyone wants a good deal, please let me know by e-mail @ hutchgolfs@aol.com."
2,a little disappointing,"The other reviews for this cook book were very good, but I was a little disappointed there were no pictures of the dishes in the cook book. Knowing that, I may have not purchased it."
3,Needs pictures,"Lots of good recipes here. I lived in Chile for a couple of years, in the Valparaiso/Vina del Mar area, and I recognize several favorites. But where are the pictures? I think a good book on food absolutely requires pictures of the foods."
5,SIX WWE ACTION FIGURES FOR A GREAT PRICE $20.00,THIS CONTAINS SIX ACTION FIGURES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE.INCLUDES FROM LEFT TO RIGHTBALLS MAHONEYELIJAH BROOKEJOEY STYLESMIKE KNOXKELLY KELLYBOBBY LASHLEYTHE REGULAR PRICE WOULD BE $ 90.00
1,REMIND ME NOT TO SHOP FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS ON AMAZON.COM,"I purchased Extreme Championship Wrestling #2 Action Figures Case of 6 for my six-year old grandson for Christmas, instead of receiving this item, on December 24th I received Kelly-Kelly a provocative action figure.cladded in a bikini. My grandson was on his way over to my home, so it was too late to go shopping for something else, and besides that I told him if he was a good boy he was going to get 6 wrestling action figures. So, when he came over, the first words out of his mouth was,""Nanny I was a good boy - did you get me my wrestling guys. You can imagine my embarrassment - I went on to explain what had happened and he said to me""don't worry, Nanny, I still love you."
4,Talk about heating up your back,The heat button works great but the other message buttons just feel like balls vibrating. I didnt expect a ton for this cheap.
3,not comfortable if you're not using it,This was nice for cold days but if you don't use it the vibrating pads basically just jam into your back. You might try and place a blanket around it for additional padding.
3,Buyer Beware,"This is an ink cartridge for an older black and white printer which I've used for some time. I'm finding many of the Amazon vendors who are sending out ""used"" cartridges are sending out cartridges that have apparently been sitting in a drawer for some time and are defective. Often they will have a blob of ink on the bottom and not work at all, especially after the blob is wiped out. One vendor has even sent me the wrong cartridge entirely, and not responded back when I asked him what to do about it?? So watch out, because it may not be worth the hassle for you."
1,Cartridges expired almost a decade ago.,"I bought 10 cartridges with a supposed ""new"" condition. Surprise! To me when I got them all the cartridges were expired on 2002, 2003 and 2004."
3,A Geographic Improvisation,"Ol' Ben finally returns home (p. 396). ""Six weeks later a light morning breeze lifted the Packet above Virginia's Gloucester Point and into the Chesapeake, affording Franklin a full view of Philadelphia"". Fortunately the ship's captain had a better grasp of geography than does the author!It took a while to slog through the entire book - too many commas and not enough periods! But the author does provide new (non-geographical) insights into the highly unlikely birth of our country."
5,"The Great Improvisatiom:Franklin, France and the Birth of America",This is a well-written and actually funny book. The energy and joie de vivre of Franklin drove this book. You learn that Paris during the American Revolution was chaotic. Everyone was spying on everyone else. Its a miracle that Franklin got the financial support he needed. Paris loved Franklin and you can see why. I loved this book. In fact i gave my copy to a friend and had to buy a replacement.
3,An American in Paris,"Stacy Schiff tells of Ambassador Franklin's lengthy stay in Paris at a time critical to our country's independence. I found the writing style of the author to be overly complicated and sometimes choppy. She favors the view that the U.S. owed a profound debt to France that was ignored by most American leaders, at the time of the Revolution and since. Paper is wasted on the story of Temple Franklin, a person of little apparent worth and no current interest. I do not think Ben Franklin or his many and valuable contributions were as neglected in his final days by his fellow Americans as is asserted by Ms. Schiff, who seems to me enveloped with the airs of a high intellectual in this particular effort at popular history.(Readers interested in this period, might like Walter Stahr's recent and very good book on John Jay.)"
3,A Difficult Read,"I agree fully with RW - it is very often hard to follow the sentences, which frequently are long and contain more than one thought. There are a lot of interesting stories and details here, but it would be nice to be able to follow a particular one for some length of time. I may or may not finish reading this book."
2,Writing syle interferes with content,"Despite enjoying a lot of books from this genre, I found this book to be almost unreadable. The author is too intent on bowling you over with her writing to write clear and interesting prose.Here's an example:""The slippery stew which was a Paris thoroughfare accounted for the city's most singular danger. No man who had the means walked through the filth of the streets, and no man who had the means hired a driver with any respect for the individual who did.""I think I understand what this means, but I'm not even sure I do. In any case, I think it is an arrogant exaggeration to make a statement like this. I guess she knew about every man in Paris.For what it is worth, I am in a book group and there seemed to be universal dislike of this book for similar reasons. I didn't attend, however, because I could not force myself to read past page 80."
2,Interesting but unreadable,"A perfect example of how an author's personal style can destroy a very interesting book. With tiresome convoluted sentences', and glib and painfully clever writing. It reads like it was written by a very erudite French courtesan of the era. I stuck with it for 100 pages. But this book is just unreadable. It's really a shame because the content is great."
5,These tests are fun and pretty accurate,My wife and I liked these tests. It was just a whim to take them but the gist of all of them says we made a good choice to hang out together and the tests areas that said no give us some areas to think about. It was fun too! Thanks to the editors!
1,"Boring, unromantic, difficult to get my partner involved","I had hoped to find intriguing and insightful veiws to improve the quality of my relationship, but found the exercises overly acadamic and devoid of romance. Hendrix's The Couple's Companion was great, and Waldman's two books, THE ART OF STAYING TOGETHER, and LOVE GAMES (I got to see a prepublication proof - it won't be in the bookstores till January 2000) were even better."
5,Randy Bachman - SURVIVOR,"The music is great!!! It was not what Amazon.com advertised. They had track listing to include ""Axe"" and ""Survivor."" Today (Monday, 01 Aug 2005), they still have too many tracks listed and one is the song Noah from ""Axe."" So, buyer beware!!!!!!!!!"
4,WRONG TRACK LISTING HERE,"Great album BUT the track listing advertised here is incorrect.I have the CD on this label and there is not this amount of tracks on the CD.There is only 10 songs available.The songs are good,not as heavy as BTO but enjoyable to listen to.Check out another solo album called Any Road much better and more rocky."
2,Eye Chart,The eye chart arrived promptly bu the description did not match what I expected. I needed a scale for reading glasses above the 4.0 magnification I currently use.
1,Not happy with the size!!,My daughter bought this mat with her own money to practice cheer and gymnastics on.. we just got it and it is not the size it claims to be.. It is not even 5 ft. long and maybe 1 1/2 ft. wide.. she is very disappointed and so am I.. I have never had any issue buying from amazon before and I buy alot through them. But this time I felt the need to complain.
5,Good quality,"This is a great quality good for exercising, tumbling for little kids, naps or just extra cushion for sit ups"
3,Eh!,"Well, I don't like the bonus fondue pot at all. Because it is heated by a tea light candle, the flame is focused on one spot and it burned the chocolate. The s'more maker pot worked fine! Really cute set! However, I need to buy a separate chocolate fondue."
3,Sibling Rivalry,"The biggest problem with Snaps2 is the original, which was an instant classic, redefined modern horror (perhaps without intending to), and set the bar pretty darn high. Comparing this light fluffy snack to that gourmet meal is non-productive, and just leaves you hungry. On its own, however, Snaps2 is surprisingly successful at creating feelings of discontent and (pardon the pun) horror from camera angles, situations, and quirky characters. Horror today is not what it was in your grandfather's time when the creature ""was"" the scariest thing in the movie. In today's world, the person in the seat next you may possibly be even scarier -- and Snaps2 deserves acknowledgment for its clever weaving of complex moral ambiguities -- including a surprise ending that (to beat a cliche even further into the ground) ""leaves you thinking."""
3,A Good Sequel,"There are moments when you forget that this is a werewolf movie...and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It usually would be, but GINGER SNAPS 2 - UNLEASHED nearly succeeds with becoming another different story: the surviving sister from the first movie finds herself in an institution, fighting her growing wolf tendencies (which the staff keeps mistaking for a drug addiction) and having visions of a full-blown werewolf coming for her.The characters have more substance to them than you usually find in horror movies. The writing keeps the story interesting, right up to the offbeat ending.Drawbacks? A little more atmosphere when the wolves show up would've made the special effects more effective. And the pretty girl from the first movie is reduced to dream-like cameos.Otherwise, an interesting and cool take on the werewolf movie. It's not the loud video game of the UNDERWORLD movies. But that's good."
4,Ginger Snaps 2 - Unleashed,"I loved this flick!It is all a sequel should be, a continuation of the original idea, not simply a re-hash of the plot from the first. Emily Perkins is gorgeous----even in the make-up characterizing her slow transformation into what Ginger became in the first flick. Ghost is a great addition, and of course, the beautiful Katarine Isabelle as the snotty Ginger, this time playing the part of Bridgette's unseen concience, (or lack there of). I think it's a terrific little movie! A slew of dead bodies, 15 gallons of blood, one ""ghost"", one ""Ghost"", heavy plot twist, Laundry room Fu, Werewolf Fu, Shotgun Fu, 4 STARS!"
3,Brigette Snaps,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie all that much. I did like Ginger Snaps, and thought that it was kind a of new twist on the tired old werewolf genre... but it didn't seem like it needed or warranted a sequel.This movie went in a direction that I wasn't expecting. Rather than just doing a retread of the first story, the filmmakers chose to follow Ginger's sister Brigitte into a mental institution after the events of the first movie. It becomes more of a psychological thriller, and focuses on whether or not Brigitte is really going to turn into a werewolf or if she might just be going crazy.Granted, that may be what a lot of people don't like about it, but I ended up really enjoying the movie. It was done with a decent amount of style and the concept was eerie enough to keep me watching. As far as sequels go, not a bad one."
2,Hmmm. Again im the opposite of everyone else..,"Okay, Ginger Snaps one has become one of my all time favorite horror films. I loved the first one,but I dont understand how people can say the sequel is just as good as the first. I had some problems with this movie. First, there were some plot holes actually there was alot of plot holes (who the hell was the wolf chasing her? Was it Sam from the first Ginger Snaps?). But my biggest problem was, im not even sure.It was boring and not that interesting.We dont even get to see Bridgette cause mayhem as a wolf.Ghost is really annoying to watch in the film and well i just didnt like this one. I dont understand what people loved aboput this film.The only thing that kept me interested was the fact that its Bridgett and actually Ginger Snaps.I love the sisters characters.But this film just wasnt all that good at all. I still yet have to watch ""The Beginning"",and since its much more expensive hopefully its better."
4,Ginger Snaps 2,"Another great movie of the awesome series! This is a worthy sequel - the movie has a creepy feel, interesting storyline and great acting on the part of Emily Perkins (Brigitte Fitzgerald). What I find to be missing are the funny/witty scenes found in the first Ginger Snaps, and LACK OF GINGER (b's sister). Yes, she is dead (from the first movie) but I miss her dearly in this one. The great sisterly bond and on-screen chemistry between the two Fitzgeralds is not there. A lot of people liked Ghost (a new character addition to this one) but I found her to be annoying at times. However, this is still a good movie and the tension is kept throughout. Definitely worth watching although the first is still the best."
5,The Story Continues,"I enjoyed the first movie and was interested to see what happened to Brigitte after she mixed her blood with Ginger's. On her own and mistaken for a drug addict and then tossed in to rehab is quite an original concept. I actually liked this movie even more than the first. Without her daily doses you know it won't be long until the tranformation happens and it's drawn out perfectly. I have a suspicion that the werewolf stalking Brigitte was the guy Ginger infected in the first movie, but that was never mentioned. Not to spoil it, but the twist at the end with Ghost was very well done. A thouroughly enjoyable movie."
4,Addiction Encaged,"[Don't read if you haven't seen the first.]After the recent passing of Ginger, Bridgette continues to mourn for her sister. She knows that she needs to be stronger than her sister was to survive, but to be stronger she must become addicted to the Monkshood that 'delays' the process.One night after going to the library to check out some books on Lycnathropy, she has another close encounter with the creature after it kills the librarian.She runs and collapses in the snow.The next morning, she wakes up in a rehabilitation clinic.Without the Monkshood, Bridgette can't delay the process. So, she turns to a worker who has it... But she must do whatever he wants.-----The sequel is very, very good. It leaves you mourning along with Bridgette for Ginger's loss. Of course, it has everything the original does plus more.You need to have this if you are a fan of werewolf movies."
3,Good,"To be fair the film was imaginative and not as nearly as stereotypical of other sequels, however, it seriously lacked Gingers (Katharine Isabelle) presence and that was just very sad, as seen as though it was her character which made the first film such a hit...well in my view it did amyway. Neverthless Emily Perkins did a great job of carrying the film to the end herself...a very good twist at the end which i never saw coming...not as gory as the first either which is a plus. Watch it..worth your money!!"
2,Pathetic,"As most sequels, this one is poorly put together and a complete waste of money. The first Ginger Snaps was original and exciting; this one has a few dotted phantom Gingers, a weird kid from out of nowhere, and an ending that makes no bloody sense. The first movie and the prequel are worth watching and buying. This one is only worth watching if you like bad horrors."
2,it's Shlocktastic!!,"Well, we were having a sluggy weekend hanging out, eating commercial baked goods and doing a whole lot o' nothing when we found this and the ""prequel"", ""Ginger Snaps Back"" on the Sci-fi channel. My wife loves the schlock and was glued to the tv for the prequel, then this morsel of goodness. Perhaps if we had seen Ginger Snaps, we'd have felt differently, but we really couldn't believe what we were seeing! The production values and acting were, well, hideous. Isn't there ever any daylight in Canada, eh? The plot, and especially the ending, were bizarre. Lots of laughing involved with watching this. Sadly, I was carbed out on the afore-mentioned baked goods, so I was unable to properly self medicate with beer, 6 or so of which would have been required to totally enjoy (sit through) this movie. I'm amazed at how popular this movie is! But that's also a great thing. Definitely a different strokes kind of thing."
2,they ruined this movie!,"Its a snore fest! Lack of gore. Dumb concept. The first one was one of the best werewolf movies ever made, but this one truly buried this series. I gave it 2 stars instead of one, because the main actress is very good. It's a shame though, I heard from the official website they are doing a prequel to the first movie in the future with both girls, lets hope it will be better! SEE THE FIRST ONE(just like the howling, everyone after the original was terrible)"
4,GINGER'S NOT IN THIS MOVIE!,"This movie was pretty good. I would have given it 3.5 stars but i liked it more than i didn't like it. The cover is kinda missleading because ginger is not in this movie but she is on the cover so... This movie is full of suprises, twists and just enough blood. I liked the first one better because i LOVE Ginger Fitzgerald (Bridgett's sister). They only way this movie could have been better was if Ginger had somehow come back to life and was is this movie!"
3,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!!!,"This movie sucked! I don't know why all these people are saying how great it was, it couldn't compair to the first. i was very disapointed in it. my friend is in love with these kind of movies and never says there bad but i guess she made an exception for this one. it is okay but i HATE the new charector ghost, she's a nut case a liar and just a total freak. through this movie i couldn't stand the sceens with her except a few. I think you should watch it for yourself's though because a bunch of people think it's great."
2,Living off reputation of Ginger Snaps,"The original ""Ginger Saps"" had a unique approach to biting and sisterly love. I will not go into detail incase you missed the original. I would also suggest you watch the original first.This movie however is just a run of the mill standard blood and guts cliché. You have the common wierdies and the standard abuse, a few tasty and tasteless scenes. Lots of anticipation and a little action. The decease sister plays very minor parts with no direction. And ""Ghost"" Tatiana Maslany is practicing to be the new Patty McCormack (""The Bad Seed"" 1956).They even run the obligatory ""stay in the car"" scene to ground.A third movie is made ""Ginger Snaps Back"" they get back on the track of two sisters. It is much better and looks like they threw some money and thought into it. You can skip ""Ginger snaps Unleashed!"" and it will have no impact on viewing ""Ginger Snaps Back""Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory ~ Barbara Lass"
3,"Seedy, atmospheric sequal","GS 2 is by all means worth a rental. It would help if you saw the first GS. This sequal has great atmosphere, intelligent story and a great wolf provided by KNB effects. The whole film has that seedy dark gothic look. Kind of like last years Gothica. The gore is good, not much more than GS 1. The characters are well developed. The screenplay throws in a couple of twists to catch viewers off guard. The dialogue is dark with humourous undertones. I liked the movie. I would have given the film 4 or 5 stars if there was more gore and nudity thrown in."
4,Even Better than #1,"It's hard to find a good werewolf movie. Here we've got two in a row!I'm a huge fan of the original Ginger Snaps -- quirky, funny, twisted, and clever. But honestly, I didn't think that they could pull off a sequel. Thankfully, I was wrong. This movie was indeed a worthy successor to the original, and in many ways improved upon the first. The tone was a little darker and the characters more unpredictable (which are both good things). Some reviewers seem to be unhappy with the ending, but I thought the ending was wonderfully well done, and very much in keeping with the spirit of the first movie. I have to say (shameless of me, I know) that Unleashed's ending truly had... bite ;-)If you liked the first, you'll love the second. And that's a rarity, especially in the horror film business."
2,Good - Slow - Wanting,"Written in the English of the 1930's, this book was hard at times to read and follow what was going on. It started off very good, describing John's background, his relationship with his family and his desire to go to America. It explains his stop in London and his trip across the Atlantic. His attempt to sell Musical Instruments and how he came upon Fur trading. After the family started, the story gets more confusioning and often vague on details, and only the last 30 pages talkes about his Real Estate adventures and the end of his life.Near the end, you learn that John Jacob Astor had in his will that all of his ledgers and business notes were to be destroyed which also destroyed the history and understanding of this successful man.I learned quite a bit about this man and his world, but would suggest another source to learn about him than this book."
5,LOVE ROBIN'S VOICE!!,Robin's solo albums are my favorites. His unique vocals made the Bee Gees who they were. I love every title on this CD... Buy all of them!!
4,Duel Masters is FUN!!!,"This game is real fun.You can play as Rusty,Luc,Rebecca,Flynn, and Trey.Each player has a different element. Rusty has fire. Luc has light. Rebecca has water. Flynn has dark. Trey has nature. This game is easier than Yu-gi-oh. It is hard but not too hard."
2,A short diversion,"The game itself, is based on an off shoot of the old Yu-Gi-Oh games, I remembered it from a long time ago but not much about it so I picked this up on a whim. It is like Yu-Gi-Oh however the game is much simpler, it is possible to knock out opponents in the opening couple of turns making some of the duels shockingly easy. The gameplay also becomes very repetitive very quickly, and the cut-scenes and voice overs are laughable. The only thing keeping this from getting a one isi the creatures which are varied and interesting. The problem comes with no good market system and a difficulty gaining any kind of cards beside the starter deck and having no control over what you get. Leading to a LOT of time earning trash cards. All n all, only for the super devout of Duel Masters, not the rest of humanity."
3,Role playing card game,"Kids love this game. When their copy broke, I had to buy them a new copy as soon as possible. They think this game is great, and the many different kinds of monsters they can find in this game keeps them playing."
2,waste of time,"I bought this game thinking it was a fighting game, I honestly Dont undestand the game, to me this game was a waste of time."
4,Very good,This nifty adaptor does what it is supposed to do. The maker should consider building the tool with left hand threads for safety reasons.
3,wood turner,it had a fair amount of run out. fine for a buffer but not a grinder wheel. not good enough for my lathe tools
3,"Machining, dudes","Product is OK. But, the nut or the shaft had several ""catch points"" where the nut did not turn as it should. Not something that you can't easily fix, but...Buyers should note that the sleeve that is INSIDE the collar gives you the 1/2"" when inserted and 5/8"" when it is not inserted. Not immediately obvious.Worth what I paid for it (I think)."
5,"honest effort, fun and clear","This book is one of the few that delivers exactly what it promises. Clear tabs, and oringal music by elvis, played entirely, but bit by bit. An honest breakdown of how to play the songs, with AUDIO explanations and comments on the book.If you want to play elvis, this is better than a songbook with just the tabs. In no time I was playing Jailhouse rock.Don't expect theory however."
5,Child wraps himself in it ever night,This was given as a gift to our grandson and he wraps himself every night when he goes to bed.
1,misleading advertising,"I feel cheated, advertising suggest all the 3 cards butI only received one, I made the complaint but they told me it's just one card... Ifeel hurt"
3,"nice chart, but ...","A nice chart, but it came with no instructions at all on how to test young children."
1,BOYCOTTING INTUIT !!!!!,"This Quicken 2005 mugging is just why we didn't buy Intuit's Quickbooks! We had read the reviews that showed a consistent pattern of Intuit's to shake down its loyal customers with sunset crap.Now we have to go find another online banking tool.Intuit do NOT deserve our business, folks!!!!!"
1,"TROUBLE, TROUBLE, TROUBLE","Like many other reviewers, I have been a devoted fan of Quicken for over 10 years. I was looking foward to upgrading from Quicken 2002 Home & Business to the 2005 version. The upgrade itself went fine, but my online updates are freezing and the program has crashed my machine (XP). Online Chat has been no help and I am not sure what to do next."
1,Don't Upgrade to 2005,"If Intuit doesn't allow us to use our existing QIF files to migrate to the newest version and allows only limited functionality in downloading online transactions, then why bother to EVER upgrade!!!I'm going with the majority here, Quicken 2005 sucks. Only one guy (probably Intuit employee) wrote something positive. It's time these companies start LISTENING to customers - not DIRECTING them!I'm not impressed with Intuit. I'm boycotting all of their products."
1,"No more QIF imports, very customer unfriendly","Quicken has some silliness on their site written by marketing that talks about how QIF was designed for customer support and not an import / export format. Yet, strangely, they've been using it for import and export for 10 years without too much difficulty. Now they are dropping support so that I can no longer import my transactions from numerous financial institutions including eBay / Paypal. I guess I'll stick with Quicken 2004 until Quicken and their financial ""partners"" figure this one out. I wonder if Microsoft Money still supports QIF?"
1,This Upgrade Removes Features,I have been a loyal Quicken user for 10 years so when I upgraded to Quicken 2005 I was shocked to find out that I could no longer download transactions from my bank using the QIF format. When I went online to determine what I could do about it I found a web page suggesting that I move to another bank ... well I found a better solution!! I am moving to another software program ... my recommendation DON'T BUY THIS CRAPPY UPGRADE ... I for one am moving to Microsoft Money.
1,Loss of QIF import,"Quicken 2004 will be my last purchase of the Series. When importing a QIF file , they do warn you that Quicken 2005 will not import QIF. My credit union uses the QIF. SO DO I. I've never gotten used to MS Money, but that looks like the way I will eventually have to go. Only 8% of my credit unions downloads are QIF driven, so they will not upgrade to Quicken's new standard. Too expensive and I don't blame them."
1,QIF Support Is Just the TIp of the Iceberg,"Intuit has also decided to drop support for CheckFree. They tried this with Q2004 but evidently many customers,including myself, howled until they relented. Well this time, they've decided to go on stealth mode. If you upgrade to Q2005 and use CheckFree, they change you to a new billpayer WITHOUT WARNING OR AN OPT OUT.I'll hang on to Q2004 thank you."
1,Horrible upgrade - do not buy,"Horrid upgrade. Hours and hours trying to get it to work, finally came up but missing transactions, balances all wrong,etc. error code 7300. tech support says it is corrupted transactions but all works in 2004 version which I went back too. Forget the 2005 version."
1,"Why isn't there a ""no star"" rating?","I have never regretted buying software so much as I do now. I wish I'd read these reviews prior to making this purchase! Heed the warnings if you are only now researching this software! It is everything the other reviewer reported, plus a friggin' nightmare. Thank goodness it was easy to uninstall."
5,No problems installing Quicken Deluxe 2005,"I was previously using Quicken 2001, and was prompted by Intuit to upgrade to Q2005. Since I would no longer be able to pay my bills online with my current version, I had no choice but to upgrade. After I ordered the upgrade, I read many of the negative reviews on this product, and thought about canceling my order. But after reading reviews for Microsoft Money, I wasn't overly impressed either. I decided to stick with Quicken. My OS is WinXP. I think it took about 20 minutes to install, and I had no hang ups at all. My data (since 1996) transferred over just fine, and I even made the connection to my bank to download transactions. Very easy set up.I gave it 5 stars, just because it does what I need it to do. The only thing I do with Quicken is download my transactions from my bank, pay bills on-line (through Quicken, not through the bank's site), and run a few cash flow reports. For what I need to do, it works just fine."
1,More trouble than it is worth,"I've been using Quicken since it was created & it has always been a mess. I have never been able successfully to transfer data between Quicken for Windows & Quicken for Mac, and have had a lot of other trouble with it, including problems restoring backup, etc. Customer service is non-existent. The problem is, it is just about the only game in town. Microsoft Money may be even worse. Someone, somewhere, should be able to come up with something better. This is a product that was designed, and the company is being run, by greedy fools. I'd like to meet a few of them someday, heh, heh, heh . . ."
1,Got robbed!,"I also require qif imports! I wish I had done a little home work before purchasing Q2005! Luckily I haven't installed it yet, and will try to return it.I will try MS Money Small Business, or some other program. Hopefully some other company will sweep in here to fill this void left by Intuit."
5,"These reviews scared me, but I have had NO PROBLEMS","I have been a Quicken user since 1999 and had upgraded only once - in 2002. I did not upgrade in 2004 because of all of the negative reviews on this site, but I was recently forced to upgrade to 2005 because of Intuit's sunset provisions (they are no longer supporting the on-line features of 2002 and earlier). I was terrified of upgrading because of all of the negative reviews, but the upgrade and conversion went very smooth. All of my accounts transferred over to the new program and the new interface is still very easy to understand. I have not been bombarded with products Intuit is trying to sell, and I have not found any bugs or conversion problems. I am starting to think that the only ones who post a review here are those that had some problems (a very vocal minority). The vast majority of users must not have any problems and must remain relatively silent."
2,Transaction Recognition? I don't think so.,"I purchased Quicken based on its claims to have greatly improved auto-recognition of bank transactions.I can't imagine what it was before, because it rarely recognized any bank transactions into categories, even when it was a recurring charge or bill.I stopped using it, but afraid to return to MS Money given all of the newly reported bugs in that software."
1,Quicken 2005 a major disappointment,"I would note, in addition to the long list of problems mentioned by other Amazon reviewers, that Quicken 2005 has made unfortunate changes in the way investment data is entered. Instead of the intuitive ledger-type format of earlier versions, each investment entry has now to be ""edited"" through its own pop-up screen. Transfers now have to be done in two steps (first buy or sell, then transfer the proceeds to the account you want...).Stay with your earlier version, and hope Intuit can be pressured into revamping this dog before the workable versions are ""sunset""!"
1,Quicken Doesn't Consider The Needs Of Their Customers,"I've used Quicken for probably 10 years or more. But with this last upgrade to Quicken 2005, I was shocked to discover I can no longer import my transactions for my 401K plan at Schwab. Many financial institutions are not supporting the new method Quicken uses to import data -- and if they are many are charging additional fees.Bottom line - don't buy Quicken unless you want to manually enter all of your information."
1,Quicken 2005 Premier,DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE. I was forced to upgrade to Quicken2005 because of the damn sunset policy on my Quicken2001 Deluxe. Bought a Quicken 2005 Premier on Sunday and have been trying to install and convert my old data file for three days. Spent three hours online with the tech support that yielded nothing. Spent another 1 1/2 on the phone and still got nowhere. Wish I can give this a negative 10 stars. Maybe it is time to consider MS Money!
4,QIF Import is possible in Quicken 2005,"While you cannot import QIF directly to some types of account, you can always open a cash account and import QIF there. And you can cut and past your data to wherever you want.I have tested it in Q2005 and it just works fine. Wish this help you a little."
1,QIF Data Import disabled beginning this release,"From Quicken:We are implementing the changes to QIF Data Import in three phases.In phase two, with the release of Quicken 2005 for Windows, QIF Data Import will no longer be available for checking, savings, 401(k) and all other brokerage accounts.Why:Some of the limitations with QIF include the following:QIF was never designed to be a transaction download standard, it was designed for technical support purposes.QIF Import can lead to duplicate transactions.QIF Import requires a multiple step process for data import.QIF does not allow Quicken to automatically set up accounts within Quicken.QIF is not supported by Intuit technical support.Flawed Logic:So forcing the user to enter all of the transaction individually by hand will solve these problems? I don't think so.Quicken has also the flawed logic that customers will switch from non-cooperating institutions to get OFX support. Not me."
1,"Problems installing, can no longer download transactions","I have used previous versions for seven years. This program would not install on the same computer where I had a previous versions of Quicken, even after removing them. I worked with technical support for about four hours before giving up. I finally put it on a computer that never had Quicken installed.The 2005 version does not allow QIF files to be imported into bank accounts. Since there are often problems downloading from my bank using the standard options, I now have to key in everything instead of downloading transactions. The end result is this version of Quicken offered nothing positive and I lost the ability to download transactions. For me, this makes the program practically unusable."
3,Heads Up Before You Buy,"Quicken is migrating away from QIF files but not all the financial institutions have caught up. You can still import QIF files for credit card transactions, but cannot for investing transactions. This caught me off guard after upgrading and trying to import my recent quarter's 401K activity and could not. So before you upgrade make sure the financial institutions you use will be able to communicate with Quicken 2005."
1,Forget about your refund... for a while,"After discovering this software is a major piece of crap I returned the package to Intuit as per their Satisfaction Guaranty policy. It took them over three months to refund my money. I called them 8 times to get status updates on my refund and all they did was bounce me from one person to another... promised someone would call me back and no one never did.On top of that, they made a mistake and forgot to refund the sales tax. It took another several weeks of grief to get them to acknowledge their error and refund the remainder. Phew.Overall, 0 stars for software and 0 stars for customer service."
1,Intuit's policies have to stop,"Here is the feedback I sent Intuit:Intuit's discontinuation of the old Quicken versions (2000, 2001, 2002) is completely uncalled for. It is clear sign of your corporate greed and attempt to force your loyal customers to upgrade to vastly inferior Quicken 2004 and 2005. I have been Quicken customer since 1998, however, your continuous policy of ignoring your customers and trying to milk them for upgrades is going to force me to switch to alternative products. Your company is not a monopoly in personal finance software and you should consider making your customers happy.I upgraded to Quicken 2004 due to your policies. I am very dissatisfied with it. The moment when Quicken 2004 is discontinued, I am switching to your competition. Have a nice day."
1,Is not getting any better,I have been buying Quicken for the past couple of years they have not improved all theire bugs. I actually lost data and one time lost all my data and had to re-enter account informaiton (took a whole weekend). Quicken is not getting any better from what I am seeing they are upgrading by name only and charge the same price.
3,Quicken support as lacking as always,"I have purchased the 2005 for Mac and it installed and works fine.However, the registration process doesn't work and it keeps bugging me to register online. When I try to it just keeps coming back to remind me to register so I have to click TRY AGAIN LATER every time. I talked online with Quicken support and they said they are aware of the problem and are working on it and for me to check back. I asked to be notified of a fix but was told that I would have to check back.Intuit support is just bad."
1,You would be better off with pencil and paper,"So I bought the new Quicken Deluxe 2005 for Windows ME (a supported version according to the box). After spending 5 hours trying various ways g to install it (it crashes my machine on boot up - I have a computer science degree and I patched, copied and pleaded with this thing) I anxiously awaited the help lines to open up - (they run only on Pacific time). I got into one of the chat lines for help and was 49th in the queue and after an hour or so gave up. It won't install for me and I was unable to get support. 12 hours attempting to install this - I could have done a budget on paper in half that time. So if you have windows ME learn from my experience and use stone tablets instead - it will go faster."
1,Very Poor Performance,"I have been a Quicken user for 15 years and recently upgraded from 2004 to 2005 deluxe. To date, this is the slowest performing release yet. After spending many hours with quicken support via e-mail, chat and on the phone, no one could help. I also found may other users in Google groups indicating the same poor performance. Another big drawback is that in 2005, there is only partial support for QIF files. I used these frequently and can not understand Intuit's logic on removing this feature. I plan to request a refund for this product directly from Intuit."
1,DO NOT BUY QUICKEN 2005 -- DO NOT UPGRADE,"Intuit has really ripped off anyone who buys the new Quicken 2005. They suddenly (without warning or notice) stopped supporting the QIF format, and almost no financial institutions are compatible any longer. This is extortion by Intuit to get customers to pressure financial institutions to switch to OFX format and pay Intuit big bucks.This should be the end of this product. Everyone should demand refunds and contact the Better Business Bureau immediately.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Horrible is an understatement,"I have been a Quicken user for probably 10+ years. When I converted to 2005, old deleted memorized payees reappeared with no way to delete them again. Quicken math has been improved to display 5 shares @ $5 / share = $23.48 instead of the desired $25. For math errors, there is no on-line help or chat help. You have to pay $25 to help debug their program - and it's only day 1!"
1,Time to start boycotting Intuit,"I've been using Quicken and Turbotax for almost a decade now but their behavior is getting progressively worse. First there was the Turbotax fiasco with spyware and malware being installed. Now Quicken is ""sunsetting"" each version three years after it is installed. Check me out if you don't believe me - the URL is http://www.intuit.com/support/quicken/sunset/. This is beyond egregious. I urge you to consider alternatives: Microsoft Money, Gnucash for linux users, Moneydance."
1,Quicken,"I have been using quicken since '92 and it is awful. They have no customer service and will not even return a email inquiry. Someone needs to come along and shake these guys up. Microsoft has almost the identical program. But, they want to control everything you do.Somebody out there, please, create a new program, before I go back to writing it by hand. Most of the garbage in this program is useless."
4,Great Product Overall - Upgrade is Cosmetic Only,"Quicken is a great product -- I recommend it highly over any competing software packages. If you don't have financial software at all, this title is the one to get. If you have a competing package, it will benefit you to switch. I have been using Quicken for years and am extremely satisfied.If you have Quicken 2003 or later however, don't bother with this upgrade. I upgraded this year, after having skipped last year, and realize now my money could have been better spent elsewhere. For Quicken Deluxe 2005, the improvements are mostly cosmetic."
2,no qif support,"Without this support intuit is forcing people to buy Money, since they are charging financial institutions for the proprietary QFX format."
4,It is OK,"I am not a fan of Intuit, and I bought this product only because their sunset policy disabled features I used in Quicken 2002. My view has been that the high point of Quicken was reached in 1999, and the next several versions were increasingly bloated and more difficult to use. I resolved not to go beyond 2002 until I had no choice. I installed the 2005 version with great trepidation, but much to my surprise it seems to work just fine. It is a little faster than the 2002 version and has some nice features. Ads are less of a problem than in the 2002 version. I think some of the low marks given by others are because they are pushing this product pretty hard. I don't disagree with their comments, but for people who use Quicken without asking for signficant import/export activities it should work just fine. I have had no problem with bank and credit card downloads. My two cents."
1,What a worthless piece of garbage,I could probably crap out a program that works better than this one. Downloading transactions with this is just a migraine and a half since it would not download from my institution. I just kept getting error messages when I knew all my information was correct. I had this thing set up and running fine for about a month and then this starts happening. I've had to reload this program before just because it's been a major pain in my a#@. I whole heartedly agree with a previous reviewer that I would have given this zero stars if at all possible. Amazon people can you make a function so that I can give this zero stars and rest at peace. Find something better to use than this POS. I hope this helps and have a very bad day.Disgruntled and angry in College Station
1,QIF Detour,"I am using Quicken 2002 and Recently received the sunset letter forcing me to upgrade, because most of my accounts required QIF format, the 2005 upgrade is useless to me. I decided to go around this by purchasing quicken 2004 from amazon's members selling section. I was able to get it for 11 dollars and still keep my QIF functions, well at least to whenever they decide to to retire quicken 2004. Hopefully, by then all the banks will have upgraded there systems to accept other formats."
2,Forced Upgrade Foolishness,"I'm a user of Quicken 2002. It works fine for my needs except that Intuit has chosen to ""sunset"" all the online features. Now I don't expect that q2002 should be working 100 years from now, but 3 years ain't so long.If Intuit were a customer-oriented company, they'd allow me to buy an ""online service extension"" and give me another 10 years. Instead its all about the $40 for the new version which will probably ""sunset"" in 2006 or 2007 to get me to upgrade again.For tracking your finances, this software works just fine, but budget in an ""upgrade"" every few years. [Also the whole basic, deluxe, superdeluxe, f500-deluxe, warrenbuffet-premiere stuff is just dumb. Get the bean counters to factor in the marginal-loss due to the annoyance of trying to figure out which one does what.]"
1,Not Software... It's a Subscription,"I've been using Quicken since back in the days when they were practically giving it away to establish a toehold in the industry. My how times have changed.Now as the undisputed leader, they've reversed strategies, and it's the customers who have to pay. This is no longer a software product, this is a subscription, as evidenced by their ""sunset"" policy of requiring upgrades in order to access data from your own bank accounts.I'm extremely bitter about being forced to upgrade. I'm ready to bail for the first software alternative which will allow me to export my existing Quicken data. Unfortunately, however,Intuit has a virtual monopoly with their online banking support. If there's a bright side to this, perhaps their recent heavy-handed tactics will encourage an open non-Intuit standard for online banking.If you're not currently an INTUIT customer, avoid this like the plague, or you'll continue to pay again and again."
1,BEWARE: Does not support QIF import into bank accounts,"Ok, so I finally took the bait and updated from Quicken 2003 to 2005. At first, everything was hunky dory. Then reality hit: the new version does not support the import of QIF files into bank accounts (Checking or savings). From the companies web site:Beginning with Quicken 2005 for Windows, QIF Data Import will no longer be available for most accounts. To learn more about which accounts will be affected please click here.If you're like me, the QIF file is the only thing my bank supports and it's fundamental to making Quicken work. To take is away so that Quicken can drive more customers to their own banking services is practically criminal. Time to convert to MS Money."
2,Barely average -- just like MS Money,"This market segment needs a good program. Quicken used to be a good program (relative to competition) about 5 yrs ago. They had good interface, etc. The interface of the current version is too busy and not easy on the eye. MS Money is far better on this regard (subjective opinion) and has better graphs also in life planner. If you are new to this type of software, Money is easier to learn, but not by much (based on the 60day free trial of Money). Now, Money has a new version -- do not know if it is a big improvement."
3,Too Small,"The canisters are small! They aren't big enough to put coffee, tea, or sugar in. They aren't sealed either so they won't keep anything fresh."
3,cute...but...,"i got these at a great price, and when i recieved them i was both pleased and disappointed. first, the disappointment: they were much smaller than i thought they would be, perhaps my fault for not looking at the measurements but when i think ""canister"" i think big ol' pots. these are very little, so if you are looking for utility these may not be the best choice. also, one of the metal labels had fallen off in the shipment. a little rubber cement took care of the problem, but now i know i'll have to be darn careful when i clean them.now, the good: despite their size, or maybe because of it, they are quite attractive. the i want to say pewter accents are for lack of a better word cute, and overall, for the price, i certainly liked them enough to keep them."
4,One Of The Great Groups Of The Fifties,"Contains the hits ""Lollipop"", ""Mister Sandman"" and more, including their own hit versions of other girl group hits like ""Eddie My Love""."
4,beautiful,"I am a novice, but this book is for everyone. I did have to go out and buy a a few things, but who shouldn't. I loved the photos and the narration and there is nothing like cathing a two pound bream or sunfish, whichever you prefer on a three weight fly rod on a fly that I tied! Even better is when a four pound Bass wants to get involved, which is what happened on my last excursion (sorry trout guys!)."
5,Getting To Know Virginia,"I bought and read this book in preparation for moving from San Diego to Norfolk...I wanted to get a flavor of the area. What a pleasant surprise! A fascinating read and one that will make you want to visit the area to see where ESB lived, and where she had such influence in preserving historical Richmond."
4,It's a good book!,"This book is very good for fourthh graders. The things the main character does are understandable. All in all, this was a good book."
2,Some Good more bad,"It was very frustrating getting it in - wouldn't fit. Yes it is the right one. It gets 2 stars for being sturdy - I know, because the frustration led to it getting drop kicked across the shop. Probably not returnable as a result. GM gets a poor review for dinking up the air intake. My '03 Duramax air filters just dropped in, no problem. K & N will probably call it precise engineering. I call it just making life more difficult than it needs to be. I will still use K & N in my other vehicles but if you have an '08 Duramax I don't recommend it. Any product requiring that much aggravation won't get many stars. Open note to K & N: You guys build great stuff, I regret to say this one isn't your best work."
1,"Lost of power, engine service light came on, and stranded me","I was so impressed after reading about the 1 Million Mile Warranty, I ordered this filter for my 2008 Silverado 2500HD, Duramax 6.6L. Amazon 's fast delivery had it to me in 2 days. I was heading on a 500 mile road trip, and hoped this would help with fuel economy and performance. WRONG!Three miles down the road and the warning lights started, Engine Lost Power, Change Air Filter, Service Engine Soon, and then I was on the side of the road.Called H&N;, the rep stated that ""some '08 Duramax will not except this filter, and I should return to the OEM Filter."" THANKS! A little too late for that, after I'm out here dodging traffic without an OEM Filter in my glovebox.Removing the top access cover allowed me to limp back home and remove the problem cartridge."
2,K & N Air Filter,I purchased a K & N air filter for my Chevy Silverado 2500HD DuraMax. So far have not been able to get it to fit properly. Pretty disappointed in this product.
2,No improvement,Replacing the OEM filter with the K & N did not help performance or mileage disappointed in my 2006 GMC Sierra
4,Professional Tarot - An Honest Review,"Greetings! This is an excellent book overall with just a few minor things that keep it from getting 5 stars. If you want to know how to start your own tarot business this is the book for YOU! Lots of great content and information, the author really knows her stuff. It seems like she's been around the block quite a few times! Probably the only major downfall in the writing is just her perspective at some points. She does ramble and complain a bit in the beginning how women are so under paid and that they should stand up for themselves when it comes to business. Im not disagreeing with her, it just seems like this book is not the place to do that and it also makes the men feel uncomfortable. Other than that, her nursing background really comes through in the writing which is OK but I would prefer to see it less and more of her tarot background. But this book is still worth the money all around. Best of luck!"
5,most helpful book for starting a tarot buisness,I ordered this book for my son to help him start his tarot reading buisness. He said it was one of the most informative books he has recieved. Will definately help with any questions he may have had.
4,arousing coffee,Probably the best present I have bought my girlfriend since I've known her. She was cautious at drinking a new coffee even though she loves flavored coffee. She brought the coffee to make at her job. Everyone at her job was asking here where she got it. She received compliments left and right over it. If you loved coffee and want to try something new go ahead. I thought it was a tad bit over priced but it isn't like I will buy it everyday.
5,ONE OF THE BEST SEASONS IN THE COLLECTION!,"For all of those L & O fans, this is a must to add to your collection. Classic episodes that we never tire of (even tho they can be viewed on cable). Curl up on the sofa with a bag of popcorn & Season 7. Enjoy!"
2,Loves Passionate Embrace,"This book was allot steamier than I thought it would be coming from a missionarys daughter. If you like this sort of thing then you will definantly enjoy this book. One thing that has to be said about this book is it has two steamy sex scenes wich rate at least a 4 if not 5 star, one that starts out in the water, HOT!!! but beyond that it's a pretty forgettable story line. It has adventure, romance, LUST,sex, some mentions about God, but never anything to deep, and everything works out in the end. What more could you ask for??? More depth, BEYOND SKIN DEEP."
1,"Broke after two months, still trying to get it fixed after 4","Very happy with this product for the first two months, after that inverted color vertical lines appeared and multiplied across the screen. We have been contacting Zenith for four months and still do not have a working television or refund of money. This TV was a complete waste of $2,000.00 and I would not recommend any Zenith products to anyone. Thanks to Zenith, I got to watch the Super Bowl on a 15"" CRT monitor, despite investing a significant amount of money in a plasma television."
1,Same problem as other customer..... Do not buy!!!,"I paid $2,500 for this set at Best Buy and within 8 months starting to have problems. By the 10th month total outage. Best buy is trying to get us a new set but As I can see other people have had the same problem. Buy a different brand."
1,Not the original uncut version.,"On the cover of this DVD release, it is advertised as ""Raw and Uncut"". However I don't believe this is the original uncut version. Some scenes have been cut from the movie from what I can remember of the old VHS version. The DVD transfer is farily poor. Also there are no DVD extras on the disc."
2,Not much Laura,"THe movie itself is fair, but Laura Gemser(the reason I bought said DVD and covergirl) is barely in the movie. She only has one brief nude scene and it only shows her butt briefly. Only good for collectors like myself.And yeah, the movie seems pretty cut to me as well."
3,A mish-mash of ideas and themes,"As a longtime player of Warhammer Fantasy RolePlay (WFRP) I was very happy to see Hogshead pick up the rights to WFRP after Games Workshop abandoned this great product. This is the first new adventure material produced by Hogshead and while welcome, is not neary as good as some of the older adventures in the Enemy Within campaign (Death on the Reik, Power Behind the Throne).In this adventure, the players are racing against time to forstall an ancient prophecy about the return of a Daemonic entity in and around the city of Marienburg. The problem is in trying to maintain a coherent storyline when each chapter is being plotted by different authors. In the end, the adventure comes across as a mish-mash of interesting ideas but the coherency is lost. It is still a good book, however, just not great. There is a good balance of investigation and action and would suit pretty much any gaming group."
3,Great item + poor shipping time = 3 stars,"Once this item finally arrived, it is exactly as described. The ""tear drop"" shaped piece in the middle (with the black lettering) is actually cut away so it's really 2 magnets in one. Great item to show your support of your local EMS, however...You're taking a risk with this seller as they do NOT use any type of shipment tracking. 21 days to ship a single, simple, flat magnet from & to the continental US."
1,"SIMPLISTIC, UNINFORMATIVE","THIS BOOK IS DISTRESSINGLY SIMPLISTIC. IT INCLUDES NO LOCAL COLOR, NO SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CITIES THAT ARE STUDIED. IT OFFERS NOTHING MORE THAN ROWS AND ROWS OF NUMBERS -- AND NOT VERY RELEVANT NUMBERS, AT THAT. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,"rates Cookeville, TN (dog killing city) as #1","Apparently this book rates Cookeville, TN as the #1 small town in America. This is the place where an innocent family was pulled over, dragged from their car for no reason, and had their pet dog shot to death in front of them."
1,Poorly Done Book with Deceptive Subtitle,"This book isn't about perfectionism, so don't let the subtitle fool you. It's really just a rich woman spouting niceties, using bland positive-thinking style philosophies. Her ""advice"" is nothing more than motherly observations. Along the way she tells some depressing stories about her family that she tries to turn positive and constantly needs to tell us about her husband (a lawyer), her trips (like to Paris where they just went to ""do nothing,"" and the famous people she knows (Jackie Kennedy). She tells little stories that snobby women at New England tea parties may find cute, but the average reader won't be able to relate to.In the end there is nothing solid to help the reader learn to overcome perfectionism and have ""balance and freedom."" It's just a bunch of platitudes strung together, such as ""be true to yourself"" and ""take time for yourself."""
1,She tells her story,"There are different ways to compose a book of this subject.a.One way is for the author to tell people about his or her life, to carefully exaimine one's OWN life/experiences, and share one's own biography/story, as related to the topic.b.A second way is to identify experts on the subject, and to grapple with their thoughts and explain their insights.This book is type ""A"". It is the author's story.If you like biographical 'how to' books, I think you may like this one.However, for me, I do not find her style useful. I was seeking more substance, more material, and more insight. However, I believe this book may be OK for many readers who like this sytle."
1,Very good book,"I wish I had read this about 30 years ago. A lot of practical information with her usual wit and humour. Alexandra is always personal, warm and human."
3,Could have been much more concise,"I bought this book as a textbook for my MPH program. It doesn't state facts right away, it just elaborates on and on, and you have to read all over to find the thesis. Could have been much more organized. It also has lots of numbers and statistics while it can just point out what they indicate. It's a good book, but with lots of redundant details."
4,Good guide to understanding Public Health,"This book really tells us what the Public Health is and how it works, as the title suggests. Even though data or statistics cited are somewhat outdated, you can understand the fundamental meaning of PH."
2,The story needs improving,"If only authors would keep from repeating themselves and doing so, draw out the story. It could have been a good story but for the above so dear author get on with the story. The end made me cry but Lady Wicksfield is a first class bitch."
5,"Read ""A Bird in Hand"" first...","Did you know that Sedge first appears in ""A Bird in Hand"" by Allison Lane? Perhaps having the background which that book provides would help in getting a handle on Lord Sedgewick's character in this one. I think the books work great as a pair."
2,Kids Mix USA,Disappointing. I needed children singing the National Anthem and other Patriotic songs but these arrangements were MUCH too jazzy and unsuitable for what I needed
2,Gorgeous on the wall...horrible to remove!,"I had bought $1000.00 worth of these ""Walls of the Wild"" fish decals. I put them up as directed with no additional glue. After only 2 years I decided to remove them. Today I have been peeling them, and all layers of paint, and top layer of dry wall with every sticker. I gave them 2 stars because they are gorgeous stickers. Just don't try to take them off...EVER! Now I must go and try to repair 4 walls. I did try the lighter fluid as suggested and it was stinky and did nothing to help"
5,A delightful tale of magic and adventure,"It is a pity this book is out of print. If you are lucky enough to stumble on it in a library, or at a used book sale, it is a lovely tale.Three children accidentally meet and befriend a sweet, strange little woman climbing a tree in the woods, and find that their new friend is just what they were guessing - a witch. Their friendship with Meg brings them a new perspective, and she is also a powerful ally. But by becoming her friend, they have also gained her enemy.There are many adventures, and eventually, the children are swept into the age-old battle of good and evil, and discover that friendship isn't always easy and risk-free.This is a light and lively story, with adventures in the woods, and lighthearted magic. But the book carries a gentle message about the need for loyalty to friends, and courage in the face of seductive evil. It is beautifully written, and very engaging. Its primary target audience would be children 8 - 13 years old."
1,Have a second source on hand,"In the 2008 edition the directions to the Royal Basin trailhead were entirely wrong. Not confusing, just wrong. The US Forest Service roads are poorly marked and maze-like. The road maps in this area are not great. Therefor, the book failed us hugely. We wasted 2 hours and gas driving on gravel roads because the book failed to mention that we make a right turn early on and told us to avoid a road that in fact we needed to be on. Be sure to go to the USNPS/USFS ranger stations for accurate directions as well as (in the USFS case) permits to park your car. As a minor note, this book, unlike others, is very dry. It does not tell you at the outset of each trail description, why you'd want to take the trail. Personally, I'd look for another book. At the very least, have a second opinion on directions."
3,"needs a rev, focused too much on backpacking","Decent overview but hard to comprehend if you've never been there. Poor maps, little on the visitor center and tourist areas. Great if you have a topo and have been there before. Not great if it's your first visit."
4,"When Islands Slam into Continents, Great Hiking is Born","Olympic is a beautiful park with diverse terrain, serious vertical gain, rain forests, waterfalls, northern pacific coast, glaciered peaks and miles and miles of trails for both day hikes and extensive backcountry excursions. The falcon guide does a good job organizing the park, providing acceptable overview references, including compelling photography (for black and white) and selecting a diversity of hike distances. There short hikes, moderate and long day hikes and multi-day excursions (though the emphasis is on the latter two). You sill need to print out a map from the national park service web site to orient yourself in the park as you flip through the pages (I often felt lost with just the couple of overview maps) but in general it is a really helpful guide."
4,"Very broad coverage (may be not too deep), good for beginners in this field","I found this to be a very good starting point for researching different types of bonds. It does cover in good detail about how the Bonds are brought to the market, the commission structure involved, also touches upon the documentation standard followed for indentures and bond insurances.I found the coverage of Mortgage backed securities pretty good! Found interesting coverage on how to structure CMOs, how different tranches and different types of bonds (e.g. non-sticky Jump Z Bonds) could be created based on the payments received on the mortgage pools.All in all I found this book pretty good, definitely worth the money (especially when borrowed from the library) and time. I would not treat it as a reference for taxation information, also while on the topic of taxation, the Munis deserved a more extensive coverage."
4,Very Helpful,"As a person studying for the Series 7 examination, this document was extremely helpful in understanding the test preparation material. Other people may say there are errors in the document, well, if that is true, then the test-prep books, and the test itself is wrong.This is a good book people. It can tell you lots of things. Its only downside is that it needs more numerical examples and more mathematical examples to show the concepts behind yield to mature data."
1,Save your money,"I bought this for My Dewalt 12"" compound miter saw. I thought it would be nice to add the laser to it.It is very easy to install, it just replaces the outside blade washer. There are no adjustments and the unit dosen't fit exactly like the orgininal washer, the shape of the ""flats"" on the Avenger are not the same (it is universal for many saws).You have to start the saw to activate the laser (turns on at 500 rpm). The problem is it will cut about a 1/32"" off the laser line. It should cut right on the edge of the line or the center of the line. So you have to estimate where the cut will be.Your better off with the saw off, bringing the blade down to your piece of work to see where the cut is. Or with the blade running sight down the blade.The saftey feature of the laser should be to line up the cut with the blade not spinning, thats not the case with the Avenger. The blade must spin to activate."
5,just like the show,this music has the energy and movement of watching the actual showvoices are beautifulpeps me up when I listen to it.
4,Lovely!,"I bought this after seeing the show, and I am very impressed. Violaine Corradi (Who also composed VAREKAI) has brought music from around the world together in this spectacular work. Whether you have seen the show or not, this album is great.NOTE: You might be a little shocked at the gender-bending vocal performance by counter-tenor Erik Karol, but it sounds great."
4,Wonderful Cirque,another lovely soundtrack to a wonderful Cirque show. Any true Cirque fan will have this in their collection.
5,Absolutely MESMERIZING and *Wonderfully* EXHILERATING !,"Hear it, Luv it, but best yet, go into that most *magikal* blue and yellow tent and experience it for yourself. 'Nuff said..."
3,Good but not their best.,"This is a good CD but not one of their best. Mystere and Quidam I think are better. This is still a good CD but if your not sure whether you like Cirque, go get one of those instead."
5,Brillant Show,The CD is just as brillant as the show..Trust me I worked on the Drallion North American tour and have seen the show several times.
2,This isn't the whole show...,"The reason I bought this CD was because I wanted the music from Victor Kee's Juggling act from the show. It wasn't on the cd. I was disappointed. The rest of the cd is okay, but it didn't have the song I wanted."
5,The DVD lives up to customer reviews,I bought this based on the customer reviews and had it for about one month now. My 8 month old absolutely loves it and remains engaged in the show most of the time. I notice how she enjoys the children and the puppets when they come on.I also have other Baby Einstein DVDs and the Brainy Baby series is so much better! I like how a woman narrates through the entire show so that my child is being taught visually and verbally. Baby Einstein is more about just listening to the music. I'm so glad I came upon these DVDs.
4,"Good, but Over Rated","Our 17-month boy still enjoys this video, but we don't play it very often because it seems like it could old quickly. It covers a lot of supposedly ""right brain"" activities, such as color mixing, image recognition, rhyming words, etc., however it lacks quality. The puppet work is poorly done, and there is no phrasing of the music with changing of scenes (done so well on Baby Einstein videos). We like the ""First Impressions"" series much better -- perhaps because they don't put on that they're the greatest thing since sliced bread.It's a little longer than 1/2 hour, so if you need an extra few minutes for your household chores, this is the one to pick. One plus which I don't know if they intended: The ""ending"" music is the same about 5 minutes before the actual end of the tape...lets you finish what you're doing!"
5,These are great movies!!,"These tapes are great! We never wanted our son to be a big t.v watcher,If we are going to let him watch it we wanted it to be something good for him. He is only three months old and yet when we put in the dvd as soon as it starts he is all smiles. Even when he is crabby he stops fussing when the movies are in."
2,Not that great,"I have 11 episodes of Brainy Baby and this one is not the best when it comes to holding a todlers interest. If I would have bought this DVD alone without seeing some of the other ones first, I would think the other DVD's were useless. My 16 month old twin boys for the first time would not sit still for the first 5 minutes to watch this one and they usually watch all educational DVD's for at least 15 minutes straight. I guess theyd are not Right Brain thinkers but they like other creative DVD's. I just suggest not to buy this DVD alone or watch it first because so many of the other Brainy Baby DVD's are great."
5,Good buy!!!,Good buy! I bought this for my 16 month old baby and she just couldn't stop watching it. It's definitely a good buy.
5,Excellent Learning Tool,"My daughter loves this tape! From the very first time we viewed it, she was enthralled! The colors are very vivid, the images are imaginative and educational."
1,This is NOT Baby Einstein,"We bought the Brainy Baby CD's (left and right brain) after reading all the 5 star reviews. And true, our 16 month old will watch them - or part of them. They are way too long. And they are cheaply made compared to the Baby Einstein series - they basically takes everything that are in the Baby Einstein, the puppets, the music, the kinetic toys, the sound effect... The music is not re-orchestrated for kids and doesn't ""make sense"" the same way as in Baby Einstein, the sound effects are wrong, the puppet shows amateurish, and then there is an annoying voice naming the objects or shapes or colors. In one place the voice give the wrong name to a color. Nothing holds the (too) many scenes together . This is fast food for the brain - go buy Baby Van Gogh if you want some right brain nutrition."
5,Amazing learning videos,"I have been educating my child with the Brainy Baby videos since she was 8 months old. My child is now 23 months old and she is on the educational level of a 3 year old. My child has mastered the sounds of all of the letters of the alphabet, she can count to 20 in English and to 10 in Spanish. My child also knows all of her Shapes and Colors. ... The Brainy Baby videos will EDUCATE and ENTERTAIN at the same time for 45 minutes ... I believe that by allowing my child to view Brainy Baby right brain Left brain has allowed her to be a whole brain thinker, making it easier for her to retain information. I am truly the proud parent of a Brainy Baby....."
2,My son just wasn't interested,My son (18 months) wasn't interested at all in this video. I think it looks well made and interesting but my son still prefers the My Baby Can Talk video and Baby Einstein.
1,Acid Trip for Infants,"This video is SO bad. It reminds me of the tunnel scene in the Willy Wonka movie. The flashing and strobe-like visual effects are awful. Each scene, picture, animal, etc. is flashed across the screen so quickly that no baby could possibly have time to focus on it. I'm amazed as to how this video has become popular let alone made it to market."
3,Every baby is different,"I was quite excited to order this dvd after reading all of the positive reviews. Unfortunately, my daughter was not enthralled by this video. We have most of the Baby Einstein series as well as some others and her favorite by far is Baby Neptune - she seems to have outgrown Baby Beethoven.She is only nine months though so I will keep trying this video as maybe it will appeal to her more as she gets older. I would love for her to have more variety."
3,Don't believe the hype!,"We bought this dvd based on the glowing reviews, but our 17 month old grew bored with it after a few minutes, where she's always interested in the Einstein dvds beginning to end. Not to mention that the visuals are identical to that of the Einstein series. If you are looking for an alternative to Baby Einstein then save your money."
4,Tasty but,I have no major problem with any stretch island product but I am slightly disappointed they decided to make the organic smooshed fruit line 0.4 ounces instead of 0.5 ounces. Otherwise same great flavor. I will buy these again.
4,Very pleasant flavor,"I picked a box of these up because we like fruit leathers a lot in my house. They are a light, easy, and no sugar added snack. That said, I wasn't expecting apple to taste like anything other than concentrate apple juice, maybe a little better.That was a wrong presumption. These have a very light, sweet flavor. My son loves them especially. The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because this brand is one of the more leathery fruit bars. I personally tend to prefer the softer texture of Kettle Valley products.As far as price, this is one of those foods that you pretty much find in health food stores, and Amazon's price on all fruit bars tends to kill the local competition unless they are specifically trying to sell off the item.In conclusion, this product:Has a very light, sweet, fruity apple flavorIs one of the chewier brands of fruit leathersIs priced great compared to most local retailers"
2,La Fea Mas Bella,"If I would have known that the discs did not have enough segments to make the movie realistic, I would not have bought it. Had two sides of two discs damaged or blank and many segments left out that made movie unacceptable. I would have like to see more segments of the show."
1,sucky editing and CD skipping,"While the editing of the novela does suck, its televisa, so what do you expect.As for the technicalities, i'm on the first DVD, second side, and it is skipping horribly... I paid for a ""new"" DVD, but got a lemon."
1,UGH IM SO DISAPPOINTED,A LOT OF FUNNY SCENES ARE CUT OFF IT SUCKS.....SO NOT WHAT WAS SHOWN ON TV...THIS IS BASICALLY AND GLIMPSE AT ALL THE MAJOR SCENES....I WANTED THE WHOLE THING....THE LAUGHS. THE TEARS....THE WHOLE ENCHILADA..... :(
4,You won't get the whole story!,"This DVD set has already been released in Mexico. Although there are four DVDs you will not get the whole set of episodes that were shown on TV. They are edited and a lot is missing, especially toward the middle and end. The main story is there, but you might have to look up an episode guide on the internet to make sense out of some of the plot. Otherwise there will be some very strange jumps in the story. Other than that, this is a great series with excellent acting and a lot of it is laugh-out-loud funny, so you will probably enjoy it even when the plot seems a little incoherent."
2,Discredited due to bad editting,"This great novela was discredited by it's bad editing. Too much of the important content was cut, the story is hard to follow because they removed too much in trying to keep the focus on only Fernando and Letty. The worst part is in how they removed the scenes of some of the most important supporting characters that directly effected why Letty and Fernando had to overcome so many obtacles. They completely lost the beauty of this love story that encompassed so many other relationships that impacted Letty and Fernando. By the fourth DVD the content is so bad, you feel cheated and the amount of money paid isn't worth it. If they were trying to save money they really sacaraficed the quality of this novela, and made the two main characters appear silly and without subtance. Shame on you for allowing such a funny and heartfelt story be cut to pieces."
4,Pleased with summary of La Fea Mas Bella,"As I leave in a country where we don't even get any kind of Latin American soap operas, I am very happy to be able to purchase these productions through Amazon. I really enjoyed La Fea Mas Bella on DVD, despite the fact that I haven't seen any other versions of Betty La Fea, I thought this Mexican version is pretty good, with no other background I was able to follow the storyline. I'm sure you can not compare it to the original version, but I think the DVD version is good enough."
2,La fea mas bella butchered up,Terribly chopped up lots of gap in between made u think that the dvd is over. Not happy!!!
3,NOT totally a carry bag.,"I thought I can put the sand toys inside the bag (by folding the chair). It turned out not to be true. The chair doesn't have a zipper (or such) to close the side openings, so it does not function as a bag. Instead, you put the toys in the mesh pocket stitched on the back. Indeed, the actual package says Beach Chair and Mat Set, not Beach Chair and ""Carry Bag"". I wish the item's description here was more clear about that. I feel deceived."
3,Great Story!,"Written in true Judith Merkle Riley style, Margaret of Ashbury goes on an adventure to rescue her husband. The thing that I like about this book, and others written by Judith Merkle Riley, is that even though the story is of a rather serious subject, it is told in such a light-hearted, humorous way. Just when you think Margaret is in big trouble she gets out of it at the last second. The characters are very likeable and memorable. This is a good book to read when your mood needs a pick-me up."
1,Too Small,"There is just enough room for the camera and that's it!,the camera strap hardly fits and there is no room to fit an extra battery. Needs external pockets!"
4,Review,"Sporting Peugeot 205's is a very comprehensive book. Although getting a little older now, so some of the pricing detail is a bit out, it is still a very though guide. I am Australian so we didn't get all of the gti models, however it is still a very good read."
2,"Upright Citizens Brigade, second season","I was a little disappointed that one of the DVDs had something on the bottom that made it impossible for me to watch several episodes, as well as many of the commentaries on that disc."
5,great,"I love this show, In my opinion it never really got the attention it deserved. The show is absolutely hilarious as is everything else they do."
2,Disappointing DVD set,"Sigh...this was another DVD set that I was looking forward to for years and bought immediately when it came out in stores. The video quality absolutely sucks. I kid you not, the old VHS dubs that I have of this season have better video quality than this DVD set does. Its grainy and looks like some cheap Canal street VHS bootleg. It is pretty obvious that comedy central put zero effort at all into this release. Disappointing to say the least. I would give it one star, but am giving it two since there are commentary tracks for the episodes.I know what you are saying, ""why didn't you post a review until now?"" Well, because I just put it back on the shelf after the first viewing and forgot about it, and stuck to the VHS copies I had. I recently decided to watch the DVD set again, and the horrid video quality actually annoyed me enough to type up a quick review to air my frustrations. Okay? Okay."
2,Might be good for women who are not currently comfortable in their own skin,"This DVD is very, very basic and does not offer much for someone who already knows how to walk and do a hip roll!! If you are looking for fun, flirty ideas, this is NOT the DVD for you. If you a complete novice to any form of dance/movement, are not comfortable with moving your body, and are looking for something to kick start your self esteem, you might give it a try."
1,So Slow!!!,"I got this DVD in hope of learning some cool strip dancing moves. Honestly, this tape was so slow and borring. I naver made it past the third move. I would not recomend it, unless super slow is what your looking for."
1,Worst Video Ever,"I regret buying this video. It does not really teach you anything. This video looks more like a documentary b/c throughout the video you only see people talking about themselves and their problems. The instructor keeps repeating stuff so by the end of the workout, you only learn how to do a hip circle. Don't waste your money on this video."
1,WORST VIDEO I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!!,"This DVD is a joke. The dancer performs quick skits without offering any valuable instruction. In addition, there is a lot of downtime and the video is very short. The skits are outdated and her moves are not impressive. This isn't even good enough to be called Stripping 101, and I am saying this as a someone who is not a professional stripper. Please don't waste your time and money. You'll be sorry!"
2,"Eh, Ok.","I bought this thinking it would show more of ""how-to"" dancing, but instead it was a lot of talking and ""encouraging"". Not what I needed."
3,It's okaaay,"If you have no clue what to do or how to get started, then this is an okay video. It takes you through some ""basic"" steps to get you started, you know....how to stand, walk, attitude, get down on the floor from a standing postion, you know stuff like that. Then once you get ""the ideal"" you can go from there. You will probally want to order other videos to still help, but this one was like a ""starter"" course for me."
4,A very good book for reference purposes,"This is the Ada book I turn to first if I have questions on syntax or how to deal with specific programming topics. It has a good index and handles topics I've not yet encountered in other Ada books. I would recommend this to someone starting in the language who wants a decent reference. It may be less helpful to someone with many years of Ada experience, but I'd still give it a look."
2,First MP3 player,"This was the first MP3 player I ever owned. I bought the product back in 2004 due to the large HD size. Initially I was impressed. Good sound and easy to use. However, within the first month it died. I had to send it in for repair and I received it back within 3 weeks. It was up and running for 3 months and then it again fell into disrepair. I decided not to get the product repaired. Again, when the product was up and running it had very good sound and was intuitive. But the reliability was poor."
4,Great Product,Love the 60GB of storage. My only gripe is that you need to load their software to transfer music. I like other models where you can plug the unit into any computer and immediately it launches file explorer...
1,Xtra Expensive POS = 0 Stars,"Within a month of buying the NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra the headphone jack was inoperable. Luckily, I was within the 90 day warranty and returned it for a replacement. It took over 2 months to receive the replacement unit. Then within the next month the heaphone jack malfunctions again. Now the unit is out of warranty. If you have one these units and are experiencing the same problem with the headphone jack, go to:http://www.playerblog.com/archives/000084.shtmlfor instructions on how to fix this problem yourself. Many other buyers of this product claim hard drive failure somewhere after 4 - 6 months. I don't think people should be reviewing this product until after it fails...because it will. Do yourself a favor and invest your MP3 player money elsewhere."
2,Digital audiophiles look out!,"Great sound but I have refined my music collection over the years. It's about 5,000 songs in 251 folders and subfolder. I spent 12 hours copying the whole thing over to the Nomad's music library -- it put everything into one folder. About 20% didn't make it because -- like most rare or foreign music -- it didn't have the latest ID3 tags. I could spend a few months fixing all 5,000 songs to have the same file info, or send it back. IF one of you early adopters has figured out a way for the Nomad musical software to look through, and play from the data folder, please share. Thanks. My email is crook@write.com"
1,Don't waste your money,"I immediately had problems - during the uploading process the unit repeatedly had to rebuild the library and after just using it for less than a couple of hours it got stuck on the EAX screen (which means you can't switch it off and it won't play or upload songs). The product has also been discontinued so whichever merchant you buy from, you'll be stuck with a unit that would be refurbished or worked on - pretty bad if the product was defective in the first place. So rather consider the Apple iPod if you want a large capacity unit - hopefully this product will be longer in existence."
1,A disappointment overall,Its big and heavy. Fully charged the battery lasts less than 4 hours of play time. Less than an hour when downloading. The software crashes frequently during large downloads.
5,QUESTION TO THOSE THAT OWN IT!!,"Hello,I am seriously considering buying the Creative Nomad Zen Xtra 60 GB MP3 Jukebox, but I could not deal with not being able to have my music organized by album with songs IN THE ORDER THAT THEY COME ON THE ALBUM. Can it be possible that they designed this product with no way to have your songs stored in the correct order by album?Someone please tell me there is a way to have songs organized by artist with all songs from each album together, in the order they are supposed to be!?!Thanks,Hannah"
3,Help,"I've heard good things about this mp3 player and I'm very close to buying one, but I saw in one review that the player sorts the songs in alphabetical order so an album's tracks cannot be listened to in order. Someone please post if this is true, and if there's a way around it so that an album can be listened to in order."
4,Problems with Firmware / Creative software?,My tips is to go straight to www.nomadness.net where Independently developed software is available. Some of the best trasnfer tools and more stable firmware updates around. Quality stuff.
4,Excellent Customer Service,"When my headphone jack gave up the ghost shortly after my warranty expired, I checked out the Amazon reviews and almost gave up without even calling Creative's customer service because of some of the horror stories being told here. Good thing I didn't. On my second try, I got a way friendly, very helpful agent who made everything easy. In less than two weeks I got a brand new Zen that worked perfectly without paying a cent, even though my warranty was officially expired.Oh, and by the way: the device itself is great. Terrific sound, great display, easy navigation...the scroll button takes only a little getting used to, and the software is easy and effective (though the instructions are confusing). The cover *does* pop off too easily, but nothing's perfect."
2,Headphone Jack / Jog Wheel,Not sure how to rate this.I bought the player for my husband at Christmas and he loved it...Downloaded nearly 300 albums since opening it...The sound is great and size is comparable to all except the slim ipods but that is okay. There are concerns though. The side jog wheel is kind of tricky and cheap feeling - if you don't press it just right you wont be able to select the menu options - works about 75% of the time but can get frustrating. The other concern is the reason I am on the site today. We have to exchange it (I hope so anyhow) because the headphone jack has stopped working and music is not coming out of the left side of headphones and speakers. I can't believe is under a month of use it seems to have broken. Concerns me even if I do get it replaced but he has had a blast with it and it has such an upside we will see if we have better luck with a replacement...
1,Beware the headphone jack,"It's a shame, because this is otherwise a great piece of equipment. But not if I can't listen to it. My 40g is no longer portable, and functions only when it's laid flat, with the headphone cable duck-taped tightly to the Nomad case so the headphone jack makes enough contact with the plug.I can only assume from my experience, and the other ones listed here, that this is a product well worth avoiding."
1,Creative Labs= Lousy Customer Support,I would not recommend ANY Creative Lab's product. Customer support is terrible. Products are generally 'good enough' (kind of like Windows) but that's about it. Mix in the lousy support and you have a product not worth bothering with
1,CRASHED OUT!!!,"After loading my entire cd collection and making countless edits of playlists, songs, (order) ect. the machine suffered a small 10 inch fall from my t.v cabinet. It was in its padded protective cover but even still this didnt help. The Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra has waisted allot of my time and I feel Creative should spend more time developing a more stable machine rather then all the wiz-bang features it advertises."
1,Total Trash,"I bought one of these and it worked olny ok i had trouble with importing tracks + at tis point the thing is usless at 6 mo old.This unit has not been dropped my most major problem occured when I had decided to fix my id3 tags which the player uses for its catalog, so i removed the MP3s with the supplied software and reloaded the same MP3s with correct id3 tages and now you cannot hear the vocals and some portions of the music.Creatives responce was to want to charge me to send it to them to look at and from my understanding I am not the olny person with this problem, buy another brand player do yourself a favor.Befor this problem player had great sound"
2,Awsome... for 2 days,"This is my second Zen. They are so awsome they deserve a chance i thought. The first one (second gen) was dropped out of my pocket while on a movie vehical, still worked. Stepped on it, still worked. After 5 months, it stopped charging and totally crapped out at around 9 months. I thought ""hey, i treated it like crap i must of broke it"" so i got the Xtra. I totally loved the thing for the 2 DAYS that it worked. I was just sitting, listening to my jams and the sound just... went off. The headphone jack randomly crapped out on me. I sent it back and im getting my cash back... i dunno what im going to do now... iPods are too much and they have sucky battery life. Maybe i'll get a cd player... or a portable record player..."
3,NOMAD ISSUES,I have found the Nomad to be difficult to use with endless problems importing music to the library and then copying to the Nomad itself in both cases the IMPORT.EXE caused the software to crash - the Nomad has frequently hung and had to be reset and battery life is nothing like advertisedMy greatest disapointent was finding it has issues copying bought downloaded tracks from Windows Media Player having bought this machine becauses it was a certified portable player by Microsoft unlike the Archos Jukebox it replaced
3,"Decent Picture, POOR Sound","While the price isn't bad for a flat screen TV, the picture is a little grainy, and seems off center. What makes this TV a clunker though is the extremely POOR sound quality. No matter what you do with the settings, it sounds like it's coming out of a transistor radio. It says stereo, but I can discern no difference in sound quality between stereo and mono on the set. The most annoying this is the automatic volume limiter. It is supposed to level out the sound, so you don't get blasted by loud commercials. Instead, what happens is the sound bounces up and down, almost without reason, and provides for a VERY poor experience. You can't turn it off on this model. I just returned this one and got a similiarly priced Phillips. MUCH better sound, clearer picture, and more control in the menu. Also a better remote."
1,terrible tv,"This is the worst television I ever bought. I took the tv out of the box, plugged it in and it did not work. Complained to Magnavox, who told me to bring it in for repairs. Went to their repair shop, they did not know how to fix it. Could not get a replacement. Will never buy a Magnavox item again."
3,Neem review,"We purchased the tablets to help our dog with a skin rash. They might help a little, but I do not see a big benefit."
4,MEMORABLE AND MYSTERIOUS,"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
3,"Works as described, wish it had an adjustable rope though","I purchased this jump rope specifically because of the weighted handles. My girlfriend and I both wanted to use it at home as part of our work out and warm up regiment. The only complaint I have is the cord is NOT adjustable. We would prefer to do our jump roping inside the house. But we don't have very high ceilings, so the rope hits it. So we have to do it outside. Otherwise, outside or at the gym would be no issue. So far, the weights are not creating any rattling noise like the other reviewer said...but our jump rope is only about two months old. So we'll see. We may get an adjustable rope soon anyway.Good rope though. Would recommend. The weights really add to the ""burn""."
4,Great fun for infants,"My little one would bounce and bounce and bounce til he fell asleep in it(thank god) Great product, safe, fun...."
3,Way too much stimulation,"This jumperoo has way too much stimulation so my daughter got bored too fast.I wish I would've bought another one with less toys as she likes to focus on oneor two only and can play with that for a while if not distracted by anything else.Also someone said that Fisher Price plastic may have BPA, I need to double check this.Does anyone know?"
4,Jumper for the Boys,This was purchased for my twin grandsons and they both love to sit and jump in it. We love the rainforest animals. The bright colors catch the boys attention and will be used to help teach them their colors as we look and talk about the red bird with the yellow beak along with the other animals and their colors.
5,Baby LOVES it!,"My son loves this jumperoo! He loves the colors, lights, music, toys and especially the jumping. I love that it adjusts as he grows (saving me money) and more importantly the safety. It's stationary and no exposed springs to get his little fingers pinched. It has on/off switch for the lights/music and also has 2 volume levels which is a nice feature."
5,The reviews were correct,"After a lot of research we settled on this one, glad we decided to order this ( couldn't find it around us in any store). We had purchased another jumper and had received one of the jolly jumpers from a friend - both did not support our daughters neck and back like this one. I found that most had way to much room in the seat. It's a great fit and the toys are easy for her to grab and play with ( unlike the other one we purchased). She plays with all but the sun/ rainbow - but she may once she gets older she was 4.5 months when we purchased."
3,Not for small spaces,"I bought this from another store because it received hundreds of great reviews. It is great in concept but for me and my 5 month old baby:1) The animal sounds annoy her.2) It has a HUGE footprint and the bars w/ hanging toys make it seem bigger. It's not for small spaces. You should see it in person before purchasing online.3) Her feet barely reach the floor at the lowest setting (my daughter is 27 inches tall) so she's not getting much bounce for it yet.4) It's cumbersome to move from room to room, especially on our carpet.I do wish I had the space for it. I'd just keep the sound off and it would suit it's entertaining purpose."
5,PERFECT!,"The Jumperoo is sturdy, sets up in no time and is made of quality materials. I purchased the jumperoo for my twin grandchildren who are 5 months old and they were instantly fascinated with the surrounding toys. They are a bit young to turn themselves or jump with agility but they are kept busy with the toys."
5,Best purchase to-date!,"I bought this jumparoo when my daughter was 5 1/2 months old, and she loved it instantly! I had to put a large book under her feet because they didn't even come close to touching the floor on the lowest setting, but I guess that means it will last for a while! It took a couple of times for her to figure out how to bounce, but now she LOVES it and just goes wild bouncing for 30 - 45 minutes at a time! It's turned out to be her favorite toy and the only one that allows me to get anything done these days. Although, it's pretty large, I definitely prefer the floor-based style over the type that hangs from a door frame for safety reasons."
3,Good Product but bulky!,"I purchased this jumperoo for my 6 month old daughter and she really loves it. She loves the toys and the sounds they make. It can be difficult to put her legs in the leg holes sometimes. It is big so when not in use it really cant be hidden too well. It does fold up slightly to move from room to room. Overall, This is a great item for your child and should occupy them for a while."
5,Fabulous for active babies,"I purchased this item for ym 6 month old daughter. She is an extrememly active little girl who needs to be entertained all the time. She absolutely loves this toy.This play set is sturdy, easy to put together, and keeps my daughter's attentnion for a long time."
5,Happy Baby,My son is 4 months old and loves to bounce and play in his Jumperoo. It is so cute to watch him andI love that it grows with him. He is at the age of discovery and this is the perfect place for him to play grab chew and discover. I would highly recommend this to anyone!!! I wish I had one of these when my 3 older kids were babies. AND It was easy to assemble. Great Buy
5,Amazing jumperoo!!!,"My daughter gets so fustrated that she can't move much mind you, she's 3 months old. This has helped out so much. She has toys to play with and can bounce all day! I especially love that I can collapse and transport it to another room easily!!!!! Best thing I ever invested in!"
5,Rainforest Jumperoo,"Nice item. A little expensive but the baby loves it and it give us a break. We know when he want to sit in it, he just starts jumping. The only tech. drawback is that it will not fit through a standard door without disassembly."
3,Fun but cause poor circulation,"My 3 month old is happy bouncing in this jumperoo. He was no longer enjoying his swing or being on his back. He is tall for his age and has good neck control so we decided to try this product. He loves being able to sit up and reach for the toys attached on the tray or watching TV with us. The only complaint is that when he's in this jumperoo for more than 5 minutes, his legs turn blue due to poor circulation. I can't obviously see anything.constricting his legs so Im not sure why this is happening. But my son enjoys it so much that we allow him to play in it for 5 minutes at a time."
4,Love this jumperoo! With one complaint...,"My 4.5 month old daughter absolutely loved this jumper from the moment I stuffed her into it. And that is my one complaint... I feel like I had to 'stuff' her into it. I do admit my little girl is in the 90th percentile for weight at 17 pounds but I still expected a bit more room. As much as she enjoys this jumper, I am concerned we won't be able to use it much longer due to the small seat size. She has waaaay more room in her exersaucer. Although the exersaucer is always fun for her, she really just LOVEs this jumper the most."
5,Best thing Fisher Price has made,"The jumperoo is the best thing Fisher Price has ever made. This was a replacement for an earlier version which served 4 grandkids and every one of them loved it. My 2 newest grandkids are jumping away as well.The jumperoo has a lot of lights, sounds and toys to entertain and is very colorful.The seat completely turns. It has adjustable straps to acommodate your growing baby.Very easy to assemble.It is a little pricey, but well worth the money.I highly recommend this product."
1,Dangerous once your child reaches for things,"My son is 9 months old and reaches for things. Today, he was jumping in this jumperoo and he was holding a teething toy. He dropped the toy and reached to retrieve it. The harness flipped and he went headfirst toward the ground. Amazingly, I was standing nearby and had reached to grab the teething toy for him. Instead of grabbing the toy, I caught my son. Potential tragedy averted and I highly discourage parents from buying this jumperoo."
1,Sent it back,"This is a cheaply made, overpriced space hog. It's huge, which would be fine if baby actually liked it. My five month old hated being in it even though he loves hopping in general. The cheap plastic toy on one side pinched his finger. And to top it all off, it's treated with fire retardants!"
5,Buy this!!!,"My son instantly loved this jumperoo. He has one of those door jumpers but didn't seem to make the connection that he could jump in it. As soon as we put him into the jumperoo, he was bouncing away, grinning from ear to ear. He is 4 months now - I had waited to put this together but given the back support I regret I didn't put it together earlier. He can swivel it on his own, and loves each and every toy. It is building his leg muscles, and also helping him to put it together than he controls the direction he is moving in. If I had to pick only one toy to have, this one would be it."
5,Love it,"My daughter was 8 months old when we purchased this jumper. She loves it. She loves the dragonfly, the dangling frog and parrot, and the surrounding toys. I read a review before I purchased this product about the dragonfly just dangling from the tray. It's supposed to do that. In fact, it's my daughter's favorite part. She can play with it without dropping it onto the floor."
2,Made for Parent Not Child,We were very disappointed in the Rainforest Jumperoo. In my opinion it's quite poorly designed. The two hanging animals are not reachable and this frustrates baby. The tray table panel is hard making it uncomfortable on baby's chest when baby leans forward. The elephant is facing outwards so baby can't see it. The pop up tiger barely pops up and so child is not engaged. Spin device and polka dot butterfly are enjoyable. It is massive and takes up way too much space in a Manhattan apartment. I am surprised it has 5 stars.
4,Easy to put together.,"Bought this for my six month old. She is 23 inches long and cannot put her feet all the way on the floor in its lowest setting. However, she loves the flying frog and bird and likes to roll the toys. I was kind of dissappointed that there were so many toys to roll and not much else to do on it. It was easy to put together though and she does like it."
5,My 6 mo. old grandson loved this,"This is an ideal accessory for the infant who's big enough to fit into it. We put our grandson in one of these 2 days before he was officially 6 months old. He was just big enough to fit into it, and he loved it. He was first smitten with the flashing lights with noise, and in a very short time he'd learned he could activate the light show by spinning the roller thing. After about half an hour playing with the visual distractions, he was jumping in it. At first he could only make a few jumps before tiring, but now, 2 months later, he can jump like a champ for longer periods, and he loves doing it. I think this will really help get him started walking. A great, useful toy all in all."
5,"I would pay $10,000 for this!!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT",I got this a month ago for my then 5 month old and she loves it! She spins around and jumps and jumps and jumps and laughs it is the greatest toy ever. A must have for every mom!
5,Jumperoo changed my life!,"My baby was very particular. She hated her swing, and bouncy chair. She always wanted to be held. When she turned around 4 months we began introducing the Rainforest Jumperoo. She loved it from the start. She jumps like mad, giggling. And the attached toys keep her attention. She spins them and reaches for the plush animals. The teether bug probably gets the most attention! I love how sensitive the motion sensor is. It doesn't take much to activate the lights and music. Encouraging baby to jump around!The only con to this item is it is bulky and awkward to move for vacuuming."
3,Good Product. As expected.,"Good Product. As expected. No compains. If you compare prices and is the best, there is no hold back to it."
5,SUPER CUTE!,"we love this!! It doesnt take up as much room as I thought it would, which is really nice AND it's so cute! My son is only 3 months old so, so far all he does is play with the toys but I'm positive he's going to love jumping in it!"
3,Some Babies Like it and Some Babies Dont,"I bought this product for my 4 month grand daughter... she seems to enjoy the lights and sounds for about 10 minutes, then she wants to get out. I think she may still be too young for it. I am keeping my fingers crossed that she may enjoy it a bit more as she gets older. I hope I didnt throw my money away."
4,LOVE!,We just got this item for our 5 month old son and he loves it! I put him inside and he started jumping up and down and doesn't stop until I take him out. The toys are kind of boring but he doesn't care because he can bounce and bounce and bounce
2,Toys? What toys?,"My baby seems to enjoy the jumperoo, she is 5 months old, but I wish I would have really considered the toys before purchasing this jumper, as most are out of reach. The rainbow color wheel, tiger that you have to push to pop up and even the lizard in the rolling ball, are not very visible or reachable to a baby. The edge of the seat is so high it blocks her vision from even seeing the toys properly! And I can't forget to mention the turning elephant that is facing the wrong way and nearly impossible for a baby to turn. I am disappointed in the purchase as there are others out there that has toys that are actually visible for the baby to enjoy."
5,Must Have!,"My child really seems to think that this is the greatest invention ever. She has so much fun in it, I wish I had one for myself. She took almost 2 months to warm up to it- at first it was more like a ""dangle-roo"" as she just sort of hung in the seat with her legs scrunched up, but eventually she began playing with the toys, turning in the seat, and one night she just started jumping! Ever since that, we can't live without it. She actually uses her walker to get over to the jumperoo and tries to play with the jumperoo toys from inside of the walker.When the jumperoo first arrived, we were unable to assemble it correctly because the metal pieces were not all the same size. We called customer service, they were very nice and helpful, and sent a new part quickly- still the wrong size, but slightly better. We have to pretty much force it to go together when setting it up, but this does not come close to keeping me from rating this 5 stars."
5,Happy Bouncing Baby = Happy Mom,"My 6 month old LOVES this bouncer and can sit in it entertained for a fairly long time, which allows me to get other things done while I have free arms."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!,Super easy to put together. My baby has fun in it atleast 5 times a day. As matter of fact she plays in it until she finally falls asleep!!!!
5,Best Jumper ever,"I so love love this Jumper. My son loves it as well. It has three hight setting, hes on the second now. He can jump or just sit & play with the toys provided. The seat turns so he can follow me around the room while I clean up. I don't know how I would get anything done (ie folding clothes or dishes), if I didn't have this. It was worth every penny"
3,Unportable Bounceroo,"We do not have an exersaucer, nor do we have decent door frames on our main level for a door jumper. This jumperoo seemed like the perfect happy medium, and after reading all the other rave reviews, we purchased it a couple months ago. However, our six month old is already bored with it--I can only get about ten minutes out of it before she starts fussing and wants out. Because of the weight of the tray and toys, it is not as ""springy"" as a door jumper, and she bounces in it but does not jump much. In addition, it lacks the portability of an exersaucer. More than once I've wished I could move it outside or upstairs or even room to room. If I could do it again, I think I'd purchase the door jumper for upstairs and an exersaucer for the main level."
5,My son loves it!,"We purchased the Jumperoo for my 7 month old son. A friend of us had it and we liked the design, the quality of the plastic and toys. My son loves the Jumperoo. It took him a couple of hours to get the hand. He now spends 1-2 hours a day playing in it, freeing my wife to do other things in the house. The different materials, colors and sounds are really stimulating. He plays and jumps all the time. We've had the jumperoo for 3 weeks and my son is not getting tired it.The only inconvenience of this model is that it is bulky even when disassembled.Would definitely recommend it!"
4,Safe and Fun!,"Our daughter loves this jumparoo, it can hold her attention for hours on end. We dident think all of the toys were super exiting, however. The Tiger that is suposed to play peekaboo just did not impress. Other than that, this jumperoo has been an excellent activity center for our child."
4,mommy's-arm saver,"We purchased this toy when our daughter was 4 months old. At first, she didn't know what to do in it. But, at five months, she really took to it and has been loving it ever since. She would laugh and tries to jump to reach the hanging bird and toad. The only con (which is just a very slight annoyance) is that it is a little hard to put the baby into the seat. Her feet always gets caught by the bottom of the seat and it's a little hard to maneuver them into the leg holes when you have to use both hand to support her weight at that position. Other than that, once she is in it, you can look forward to having a half-an-hour break for that mommy arm!"
5,Jumping Past 5 Stars!,"I love this jumperoo!!! OK I think my daughter might like it a little more than me, but it is worth it! Jumping must run in the family because I was a ""jolly jumper"" as a baby. She spends a good part of the days playing in this. She even jumped so much that she just passed out sleeping in this one day.The only thing I didn't like was that McKenna was two months and way too short for it. We put two monopoly boxes underneath to give her some more leverage. BUT that is nothing to the fun time she has had with this!"
5,The BEST!,I bought the Rainforest Jumperoo for my 4 month old and I am so glad that I did. She absolutely loves this thing. She is now 6 months old and will sit and play in it for an hour sometimes. She loves that she can jump and listen to the music. It's a great toy to get for your baby - you won't be disappointed.
5,My babies love this... and so do I!,"Both of my babies love this toy, and watching them giggle, play, and interact in it is sooooooo much fun for my husband and I. When one of the babies is in this toy, our whole family is giggling."
5,This was the best purchase we made for our baby!,"We bought this jumper for our son when he was about 4 months old because he loved to jump on people's laps. He has been using it for over two months and he loves it! At first he couldn't reach any of the toys around the jumper but he still liked to jump up and down. Now he plays with the toys, hits the items hanging above, and jumps and jumps and jumps. The other nice feature is that the seat is machine washable (which we've needed on a couple occasions). It can also be easily taken apart for travel. I would highly recommend this jumper to anyone. It was the best thing we've bought for our son!"
5,My daughter absolutely loves this product!,"This is an awesome product, it does an excellent job in keeping little ones entertained. Item received promptly and exactly as pictured/described. I would recommend this product to anyone. Thank you so much! =)"
4,Baby Loves it!,"My 5 month old baby loves her jumper, but at 26"" tall and only 15 # she can't quite touch the floor in the lowest setting. We had to fold up a couple towels to put under her feet. When she isn't jumping she is playing with the bug or swatting at the toys in the front. Be careful putting your child into it though, it can be a little tricky to get their feet into the holes. I bought this one because it can kind of fold up, and we have a very small living area. It doesn't save a lot of room, but in our house any extra space helps. It is almost a two person job to move it when it is folded, though, as it loses it's stable foundation. Overall, easy to put together, easy to clean, baby loves it, what else is there to say?"
4,5 month old loves it,"Baby loves to bounce in this thing and it keeps him entertained for a while. It's pretty well built and appears to be durable. It was fairly easy to assemble...probably took less than 30 minutes. We put a pillow underneath his legs so he can bounce a little better, otherwise he's on his tippy toes. I didn't give it 5 stars because one of the springs appears to have been preassembled backwards which makes the seat a little bit unbalanced on one side. It's not a big deal and I'm not concerned that they bouncer will topple over. I wish all the supporting bars had a toy hanging off of it instead of just the two because the baby likes to look up and reach for them."
5,"LOVES IT.....one of the ""best money i've spent"" items","My son has been in his since 4 months. He was so short when we put him in at first, had to put books under it for him to stand. he would bouce for a long time, happily. It was a great break and gave him mobility safely before he could crawl and walk. He's almost walking now, at 10 months, he's less inclined to get in as he wants to be able to move around, but he now loves to play with it from the outside, walk around it, and even hang out under it like it's a fort. He will still ask to get in at times, and when he does, bounces happily. It's definately a great buy for the baby from 4 to 9 to 10 months, helps strengthen the legs and gives mom a great break!"
5,every parent needs this!,"amazing, our daughter hates to be set down at all, but she will play in this for extended periods so our arms get a break! really fun, seems sturdy and safe, and will grow with your child. highly recommend!"
5,Great Product!,"This is the product to get in the genre of ""activity seats"". My 7 month old absolutely loves this toy, very much worth every penny. The lights and the toys along the seat are very well placed and done to captivate attention."
5,best overall jumping apparatus for baby,"easy assembly, stimulating play tray, perfect for baby ready for first upright activity,volume turns down or off for less stimulation.seat easily removes for thorough cleaning."
3,Parent-centric,"My daughter's grandma got this for her.This was deffinatly designed with the parent's view in mind not the child's. For example, the screws for the rainbow-sun toy all face the baby. When she looks at the cloud there are six screws and screw holes. There are only two hanging animals on the three posts. The monkey only swings in, which is fine when you show her it moves, but it doesn't move when she bats at it. The elephant faces away from her most of the time, and doesn't even completely turn towards her if she pulls it. the parent gets to see it the whole time not the child. Also the tiger that plays peek-a-boo barely moves. It doesn't bounce up or anything. It goes up maybe a quarter of a centimeter so you can barely see it's eyes. Oh yeah, and the toy to chew on, the cord isn't long enough. She has to be facing it exactly and lean all the way over to chew on it.The bouncing action is great though."
4,Doesn't fold up easily,"I am a grandma and this is a great entertainer for my 5 month old grandson. He loves the variety of toys. It is very colorful. The only drawback that I can see is that it is big and doesn't fold up very easily or very small for storage. As a grandma that would be nice when the kids leave for home.The instuctions state to Press the frame release button and fold the base tubes inward. After doing this it is still not very small and it is awkward. It doesn't state anything about the seat with all the toys on it which is fairly large. So I assume to make it smaller and storageable, you would need to take all the toys off which would be a pain to do very often.So If you are looking for a small toy to be stored this probably wouldn't be it.If you are looking for another piece of furniture, then here you have it. It is around 44 inches high and 33 inches in diameter."
3,Not bad :),"She is having fun, a little scared at the beginning but ok now! She is 7 months.I recommend that you use it without lights and music at first, maybe to much for a beginner.She only stays for less than 10 min, then she gets tired and not so happy."
5,a great purchase,"I had my doubts regarding the great reviews i saw on this product, but for sure it was worth it. My granddaughter, (4 1/2 mo) absolutely LOVES this jumper. She laughs and gurgles and bounces like crazy! An amazing purchase. I would strongly recommend this to anyone considering a jumper type toy."
5,He's a Jumping Fool!,"My 5 month old baby always seemed to want to stand (he can barely sit up), but lately he seems to want to jump. I wanted to get him a some kind of a jumper to help get the jumping out of his system. I ordered the Jumperoo yesterday, recieved it today, assembled it in about 10 minutes. The Jumperoo seems sturdy and safe. Baby Boy has been happily jumping for about an hour! Something tells me he's going to slee good tonight!"
4,it was the greatest thing ever for about 2 months,"My son probably loved this jumperoo even more than breast milk for his 6th and 7th month. He would get in and have the time of his life bouncing around and laughing. The unfortunate thing is that it only lasted 2 months. He didn't care for it before the 6th month and got bored with it once he started learning to pull himself up on his own. If you don't have a problem with spending the money for a toy that doesn't last long this is a no brainer. If you're on a budget though, I'd look elsewhere or try and find one used."
4,My boys love the jumperoo!,This jumperoo is better than most because your baby can go in super early. The little crab head offers support to a baby who is learning how to hold their head up. My boys learned from this toy how to put weight on their feet and how to shift their weight straight so they can sit or stand straight up. Now my boys love the toy and jump in it everyday. It was also very easy to assemble and I normally don't do well with those type of things. The only bummer is that the dragon fly does not stick straight up but hangs down like a wet noodle. I called Fisher Price and they told me it was supposed to be like that even though all of their pictures show it erect.
5,Great Buy!!!,This is an awesome item. I have twin girls that absolutely love this jumperoo!! I would definitely recommend this item!!
4,My son really likes this toy!,"I will like to recommend this product to anyone with an active baby. My son really likes to be held, but since we bought this toy, he doesn't mind being left there for a good 10-20 minutes.Recently he noticed the batting toys above his head. He stares at them with interest for long time and wishes he could grab them or bat at them. Sadly he's unable to.I wonder if his arms are shorter than his body as he's in the 95th. His upper body is slender and long. He's was able to use the jumperoo since he was 3 months and a half without having to use any books.He's learning how to jump now, and everynow and then he just jumps and jumps none stop."
4,Lots of fun - with caveat,The first time I put my 4 month old son in this jumperoo he loved it. He loves jumping around and is entertained by all the toys. It was also relatively easy to put together. Although it does take up about 4ft of floor space and is hard to move from one room to another.The caveat is - my pediatrician recommended against jumperoos because she said that it would strain their back since their back muscles are not yet developed enough. I've also since read that jumperoos and even the standing activity centers may not be good for a young baby as it extends their hips and can create problems later. But most say if you use it less than 15 min or so a day it's ok. (I also have a bit of concern with his neck and brain bouncing too much when he jumps so vigorously but I don't know if that's really warranted.)
5,GREAT PRUDUCT!,Length:: 1:46 MinsMy daughter likes this. She is getting to know how to play and jump with this jumperoo. And she has a lot of fun time with it.
5,I love it - but takes time for some...,"I purchased this jumperoo when my daughter was 4.5 months old. She might have been the only baby who didn't start jumping right away. She slowly started to explore the toys - so I tried to ""teach"" her how to jump. It took 8-10 days before she warmed up to it fully and started to jump...now she LOVES it. And it is so cute watching her little feet go! The assembly was also very easy, I really like this toy!"
5,Speedy Delivery & in Perfect Condition,"This came within the week i ordered it, nicely packaged in its original Fisher price box without one scratch on it, with all of its parts! Its going to be perfect for my daughter's first Christmas! Five stars!"
5,It's everything it says it is.,"This jumperoo is great. Haven't tried any others but really like this one.It has fun jungle noises and flashing lights and other interactive toys. We put our son in this when he was around 4 mos old and 23lbs.and thought it wouldnt last long but it's stood up to his crazy jumping so far. And I feel as though his hand motor skills advanced so much since he got this. Not to mention his jumping. One of the few cons I have are that the leg holes are a little snug for his chubby little legs so it's difficult for me to get him in and out..sometimes takes 2 of us. But if you have a normal size kid it shouldnt be a problem. It also takes up some space, about 2 1/2 ' diameter for the base, but if you have the room I would recommend this. Happy jumping!!"
5,Great jumper!,"My daughter loved this jumperoo. And I loved that it folded up! It was kinda hard at first, but once I figured it out- it folded p great. Especially since our place is rather small!"
2,bruise hazard,"This is a fun toy and my twins love it, however, there is an elephant that turns and comes back to its original position. The elephant is way too close to the frame and while my baby was playing with it he got his hand in there and when the elephant came back to his position it bruised my babies little hand. Good thing my neighbor is a pediatrician, he checked it and just recommended some tylenol. I put a big soft toy around the elephant so it wont move. They can now enjoy it safely. Be careful!!"
3,It's ok.,"We had the other FP Jumperoo (the regular one!) and that was awesome. This one was ok. I didn't like how the levels changed on this one. Also, the hanging animals with the leaves are easily twistable and ended up breaking off after a short time.This product is a MONSTER in size once set up. I remember the regular one being big too but this one just took up too much space for us. I gave it away."
4,i like it,"i like it, it's fun, but the reason i'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it looks and sounds much better than it really is. activities are limited. the only fun one is in front, with lights and music, the other two sides just have rattles. and it's a pain to fold it, it still takes a lot of space. it's not as portable as they say. but my baby girl loves bouncing in it, and that's the most important thing!!!!!"
5,Jumping before you walk or am I jumpinging ahead of myself.,"This items was purchased as a Christmas, I know I'm early. But my daughter has one for her daughter so I know that my other grandaughter will enjoy."
4,Great fun,My son loved bouncing on this Jumperoo. He used it since he was 8 months old for the next 3 months. We could leave him in there playing and discovering for 10-20 min daily. The music is bearable and volume is adjustable. The height is also adjustable to suit the age.
4,grandmom,my granddaughter was very happy with the jumperoo...she is six months old and very active....the largest drawback was moving it thru the doorways to go room to room.
5,the best for ages 5months and older,The seat can be lowered for age 5 months and older. Very colorful and entertaining. So worth the money! Purchased for our grand daughter as our other grand daughter has one and just loves it.
3,Baby loved it for about an hour,"I really liked this toy more than my baby. She loves the frog that hangs down, a lot. So much that she has bent the plastic on it and she can easily chew on it. The elephant on the main toy is a safety issue. It flips back rather hard and is easy to trap a little ones hand. Another complaint is a bee or butterfly that stands straight up on the picture. Im not sure how they got it to stand up but its like a limp noodle. My baby loves it because she can chew on it but it has no real purpose. It was easy to assemble and she likes to jump in it for a few minutes but she gets bored quickly."
5,Our Baby loves it!,"Bought the product when she was 3 months old and now she is 6 months old. She loves using it every day and even starts bouncing when we say ""bouncing bouncing bouncing..."" This is a great product to keep her entertained for a while and let her move around without getting hurt. Highly recommended!"
5,for granddaughter,"purchased this for our granddaughter's 1st birthday.fast deliverypackaged well.she is now 4 and my daughter in law has lent this out to several of her friends for their children and it still works. beginning to look use.when our granddaughter had it, she loved it....had to hide it from her or she would cry to get in it. and when she got to big for it, she was devasted.love of fun to watch her in it too. she would put herself to sleep in it over and over.thank you"
4,Grandson loves it!,My grandson loves this jumper. It keeps him entertained for about an hour at a time. It is sturdy and well built. Easy to put together. Only downfall doesn't collapse easily.
4,Good one !,Looks great.. It would have been great if had the option of castor wheels as well so the kid could use it as a walker as well if needed.
5,Grandson has more fun!!,"We bought this for our 4 month old grandson. He absolutely loves this. At first, he could barely touch his toes to the floor but now he can and he flies around with it and amuses himself with all the colorful toys attached."
3,Baby was scared of the elephant sound,"The idea is great, but the sounds are awful. I got it for my 9-month old son. He would start crying instantly when i turn on the sounds. The elephant sound was the most unpleasant."
5,Loved it!,"At 3.5 months, I bought this for my son. We used it almost daily until he was about 6 months old. He started walking at 8.5 months old. My friend with the same jumperoo and I both think this helped our children start walking early. I lent it it to a friend for her child to enjoy.Although you don't use it very long, you use it enough to make it worth it. You can also break it down to make it easy to travel with (we took it on the plane with us for a long trip because we thought it was so essential)."
5,Never seen my baby have so much fun,"Hands down, this product is the best. It is so incredibly fun to watch my 6 month old ""go to town"" using this. He is interested in the toys and loves to bounce. He's my third baby but I've never had this type of product before. It feels a lot safer than the type of ""johnny jump up"" that hangs on the doorframe. This is just the best product. The music isn't even too annoying, which is saying something for a baby toy!"
5,a must have!!!,YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS FOR YOUR BABY!!!! my son LOVED this JUMPEROO!! it is by far the BEST thing we bought for our baby!!!! the music is the great too. not annoying either. Very easy to clean/wash. 3 different heights to grow with your child. My son is 9mon now and we gave the jumperoo away. i still kind of miss it. ;) if we have another baby this will be my first purchase!!!!
4,Great product,"My six month old loves this item. Much better than the jumpers that used to hang from a door jamb that my 9 and 8 y/o used when they were that age. Only wish it was a little easier for the seat to swivel around, not a problem and may become easier as it gets used more. Great product and very happy with it."
3,I love it --- but my child isn't tall enough,"I think it is a great thing. I love that it folds up to be ""smaller"" and all of the colors etc. But my 4 month old is in the average percentage and she isn't tall enough to touch the ground on the lowest setting. I wish it had one more setting. We went to her grandparents house who have another companies jumper - she fits just perfect. The lowest setting allows her feet to touch and she can jump - not hang."
5,Easy to assemble and baby girl loves it!,"We received this product in a timely manner. It was extremely easy to assemble. Baby girl cried the first time I put her in it. BUT, she was tired! She continues to like it more and more each time. She absolutely loves it now and loves spinning the sun, lizard and other toy. It is sturdy and we love it. Only downside is that it takes a lot of space, but we knew that when we bought it."
5,My son loves it!,"I got this as an early Christmas present for my 6 month old son -- he loves it! The only downsides I can find: He's a little bit on the short side, so I have to say that even the lowest setting is just barely low enough for him. If I had gotten this for him at a younger age, his feet would've been hanging without his touching the ground. (You can always put a book or something underneath to help with that, though.) Also, whenever I take him out of the jumperoo, the fabric from the seat pulls out of the seat right along with him. It's just more of small annoyance than anything defective or bad about the product itself. Overall, I am very happy with this buy!"
3,Too tall for baby!,"I bought this for my 3 month old baby who can hold his head up & stand tall but needs balance. When I put hiIn the shortest setting he was still a good foot off the ground! I guess I can stack books underneath him, but I think they should give a height minimum to this thing."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"I rated this product just ""okay"" and I would not buy it again. I have twin 5 month old girls and they have been using this for a month now. Neither of them stay occupied in it for too long and they prefer their exersaucer to this. If I had it to do over again, I would buy 2 exersaucers over this. They aren't much for jumping in it, and if your baby is anything like mine, they will lose interest in the toys that are on it quickly. If they aren't one to jump, you won't get much use out of this. I would recommend spending the money on an exersaucer that is going to keep their interest. I think this is just a ""trendy"" toy that people like to have but when it comes down to it, it's not necessary."
3,I regret this purchase!,"Every baby is different! This statement couldn't be more true in referring to our jumperoo! My little one was fascinated by the bright toys, from afar. She sat in it for 5 minutes~ and never again!This item is quite cumbersome once assembled. It takes up a lot of space! If your home has lots of extra room for this contraption, then I suppose it could be worth it.It is stationary. Baby can bounce around, but only in the confined area. My baby was happier in a similar activity center which was a walker. (a walker has safety risks which need to be considered) but for our home, it was ideal."
5,A must have!,"We received this as a gift from my mom and this was for my third child. I had been through other jumpers but this one is by far the coolest and most fun! It spins all the way around so the baby can access everything and look around everywhere! It adjusts to different levels. The only thing I didn't like was I put her in it when she was four months old and she was too short so I had to put a pillow on the floor beneath her so she could move around, but once she grew a little it fit perfect. The colors kept her attention and she loved the spin toy! She also would just crack up laughing when she jumped the toys hanging above her would bounce a little and she loved that. She would actually fall asleep in this jumperoo too! This was a must have for those times when I needed to get some cleaning done and she wanted to be entertained! Well worth the money! Also, I was able to sell it in my garage sale for a decent amount!"
3,Great for a short time...not worth the $$,"My baby LOVED this...until he started crawling. So it was great for about 3 months. In my opinion, it's not worth the steep price for such a short period of use. Better to find it secondhand and save yourself the $$. Once our baby was finished with it, we couldn't wait to get rid of it -- it takes up A LOT of space. And it doesn't fold up neatly at all. Doesn't even fit through a doorway, so trying to move it from room to room was a major pain."
5,Great Jumperoo,"This is the best purchase we have made. Our son began using it at 5 mos and he absolutely loves it and so do we. The first time we put him on it he jumped on it for 5 mins and he fell asleep. It is stable, colorful and entertaining. It really is worth the money. It keeps him occupied when nothing else has. we LOVE IT..."
4,Jumping fun,"At first my son was turned off by all the color and activity attached to this jumper, but with a little time and patience he learned to love it. It's easy to assemble and has lots of little toys to amuse a child. I highly recommend this jumper with a world of warning for the parent's of children who are a bit scared of new things you might want to give the child time to observe it before placing them in it."
4,Not my daughter's favorite.,"I think this is one of those toys that depend on the baby. My daughter likes it okay but gets fussy quickly. She only goes in it once or twice a day for a couple of minutes.That said, it is awesome to have a place to put her when I have to use the restroom or vacuum or something. It's sturdy and well made.My daughter is only 6 months so I'm not giving up yet!"
4,jumper,"it was good product if baby wants to be inside:) she like it for the first week, now she is not so happy with the jumper. she is 6 months old.the only thing that is not good is noise. when my baby was jumping the noise from the jumper can be intense, but hey ... you are free"
5,Awesome!!!,My 7 months old daughter loves it. She gets very excited when she is in the Jumper. Worth the money we spent.
5,Hours and Hours of Happy Baby Time,"We first put our baby girl in the Jumperoo when she was 5 months old and had good head control. She was a little short for it then so we put a couple pillows under her feet and she immediately started turning and jumping a little.As the months went by she jumped happily for longer and longer periods. Sometimes for an hour straight! Now that she is 9 months old, it is still a favorite and she laughs and jumps the second we put her in it.I love that it entertains her, keeps her in one spot, and strengthens her legs (at 9 months she can easily support herself while standing). The seat is machine washable which comes in handy.I think the jumperoo is one of the best baby toys around. Nothing like keeping your baby happy while you get a chance to wash bottles or just sit and read for a little while. :)"
5,The best!,My daughter LOVES this thing. This is my 3rd child..how I wish I had this for my other two. Perfect combo of an exersuacer and jumperoo. She loves how the lights and sounds react to her movement. Very easy to assemble as well as remove the seat when you need to wash it (after the occasional spit up or blow out). She was ready and enjoying this by 4 months old.
3,My baby might be too young for this,"It's a nice toy, my maybe just might be too young for it though. She's 4 months old now and kinda don't know what to do with it. Also, the sounds it plays are a little weird, it's a monkey and other jungle animals but it's just sooo loud."
5,The Most Amazing Piece of Baby Equipment,"I really don't know what I would do without the Rainforest Jumperoo! My son was been fussy, colicky, and generally a displeasure for the first three months of his life. Nothing seemed to make him happy except for me holding him while walking around. Obviously that was not an option. I got this as a gift at my baby shower and I finally put it together when Price was 2.5 months old. It was an instant hit! It is the only place I can put him down at without having him cry bloody murder after a few minutes. He will jump until he passes out! Not only does he love the jumperoo but all the adults love to watch him in it. It's hilarious! I can also attest to it's duability since my three year old has tested it out on more than one occassion!"
4,Fun but imprefect,"This is a great GREAT item to have for a toddler. So MUCH more than an exersaucer, this toy actually promotes standing and jumping. The music is fantastic. each toy on the jumperoo is fun for small children and easy to use. My girls laugh out loud as they jump up and down. I'd give this thing ten stars except for one problem I have with it. It is VERY hard to load your kid in. I thought I was the only one who had trouble with this, but all my friends seem to have the same issue. We love it once our kids are in it,but getting them in is hard. Other than that I recommend it highly. Best of its kind on the market"
5,Love it! Entertaining for parents and baby,"Our 6 month old has been enjoying this since about 4 months of age. He is much more active in it now than when we first introduced it to him, now he boisterously jumps for joy, and literally screams with delight when he really gets going in it. This even disassembles easily enough to travel with in the car, if you just take off the 3 poles and leave them attached to the seat, then unlatch the button on the bottom frame and fold it in. When you get to your destination you can pop the poles back into the bottom frame and are ready to go. Our little one burns off a lot of energy in this thing."
5,Incredible!,"We purchased this for our five month old granddaughter-it was the most incredible purchase we have made for her! She immediately loved being in it, just sitting at first and touching the wonderful play objects. Very soon, she was jumping, moving around and not wanting to get out of it. We believe that it strengthened her neck and back muscles to the point that she was sitting up on her own very early. This is a ""MUST HAVE"" product for little ones."
5,Exactly what we wanted,"My daughter is 7 months old, so we are getting a late start on the jumperoo. I wasn't going to purchase one (we already have a play mat, exersaucer, swing, etc.), but she loves jumping on our laps so much I couldn't resist. I purchased this particular jumperoo based on reviews and also my friends' recommendations. We weren't disappointed! It was simple to assemble and my daughter loves it! She jumps, jumps, jumps and yes, has even jumped herself to sleep a couple of times. The music and lights are especially fun. I definitely recommend this purchase, especially if you have an active baby."
5,Greatest item I ever purchased.,All I have to say is I don't know what I'd do without this product...My son absolutely loves it and it goes with us wherever we go...Great flippin product
4,Baby Loves It!,"My 7-month old daughter loves this jumperoo. It keeps her entertained for up to an hour! Wish I'd gotten it sooner. My only complaint is that the little bug that's supposed to stick straight up arrived all floppy. The package looked like it had been opened and re-taped, so I wonder if Fisher Price is using amazon to sell returned items. Floppy bug doesn't matter to me so I kept it."
5,great product,Our son is 5 1/2 months old and he absolutely loves this jumperoo. He can bounce and play in it for hours ( not that we let him). When you see your baby that happy it's priceless!
5,Our very active son loves this and so do we!,"This little exercise machine is great to get some of our sons never ending supply of energy out. Additionally, it has been really fun to watch him learn to control and play with the different toys. A must have for any high energy baby!"
5,my niece thinks she hit the lottery,shes over 9 months and i was afraid it was too late for this but she squeals with happiness as she jumps up and down-it gives us all so much joy to watch her
5,Great buy !!!,My son luvs it so much...he spends anywhere between 30mins to 1 hour playing in this. We bought it when he was 5 months old. It is well built & assembly is very easy.Thanks to all reviewers for making my decision easy...
5,This thing last forever!,3 years down the road and this jumparoo still looks and sounds as new as the day we got it. So many babies have used this in my home its crazy! you would think for sure that it would have given in a long time ago. We just gave it away and are now expecting again.. you can bet this will be on our wish list!
5,Fisher Price Rainforest Jumparoo,"We bought this jumparoo for our 5 month-old son for Christmas, and weren't really sure what to expect. He absolutely LOVES it, and will sit in it for literally nearly an hour and half, just bouncing away happily! It's wonderful, since it gives us a chance to catch up on housework, or whatever else we need to get done. It's really nice that the seat rotates, so he swirls himself around to the different activities, and keeps himself entertained. What an awesome investment!"
5,Our baby loves this jumperoo,"We own other jumperoos and exersaucers and this one in particular comes in first. The seating is very comfortable and it rotates freely, which is an advantage for you and the baby. Others require your help to rotate the seat, whether this one does not and the baby can switch from one toy to another without any problem. The only regret is that I should have made the decision to buy this jumperoo sooner. Our baby loves it so much, and it is such a delight to see him so happy!As a final remark, I find it to be very safe, with the wide base it has no chance to tip over. I did take the little bat that comes with it out. Our baby kept putting it in his mouth and one day he hurt himself while jumping."
3,"Good, but not for small babies","I have to agree with some other reviewers, that this toy is probably more suitable for older babies. My 4-month old spends max 15 minutes in the jumper. Although she likes to look at the toys, they are far outside her reach, so she prefers me to hold her close to the jumperoo rather than being in it. My daughter is very active for her age, she loves to jump and stand (with support, of course), so I really wished this jumper would've worked out for her, but it looks like we have to wait a few months and see if she grows into it."
4,Another satisfied family,"We bought this when our son was 4 months. It was amazing watching him learn how to jump in this. Once he knew how he didn't want to stop. I would have given this 5 stars but all of the toys are not easy to manipulate for small hands. Really just the sun and the lizard are any fun, and they are basically the same toy. I personally do not care for the music but it doesn't matter my son doesn't seem to notice the difference between on and off. He had a thing for the blue frog it was quite comical as he got big enough he could finally reach him. Even as he started to walk this toy was handy because he would hang out in it while my husband and I would do little necessary things around the house. Now that he is a more steady walker at 11 months we can no longer use it. However, even the 7 months we got out of it, it was worth every dime."
1,Bad Product and poor shipping,"I am very dissatisfied with the shipment. I ordered BRAND NEW item from Amazon Prime and what I got was previously used and poorly packaged item. This is especially disappointing when you have a child who is expecting toys from you and when you get a toy, it is dirty, full with all kinds of scratches and a joy killer! I believe the product itself might be good one, but my order was really bad. I will request full refund for this and shame on Amazon for letting such product slip through the shipping. Whoever shipped this, I am very angry for them!!!!"
3,Great for older babies.,"I bought this product for my son when he was 4 months old, just like the minimum age on the package says. I was SO excited to see him jump in it!He is now almost 7 months old and only now can he fit comfortably in the seat and jump. My son is not small by any means, but he simply could not sit in the seat comfortably before now. His legs would not reach the floor even on the lowest setting, and the seat came all the way up to his armpits. Even now it is hard to get him out of it when he is done playing. Don't get me wrong, he LOVES it now when he is in it. His little feet can now touch the ground and he bounces up and down and laughs. Before now, however, he would just get frustrated that I would put down a pillow for him to jump on. I like this product, but I wish I would have waited until my son was older to invest the money in it."
4,He Loves It!,"I would rate this a 5 star except for one thing. The dragonfly toy that is shown standing upright on the box, in all photos and in the instruction sheet does NOT stand upright. It flops over and just hangs there. My grandson can't reach it when it flops outside the tray. He absolutely loved it in general and it took him about 2 minutes to figure out that he can bounce in it and he is just 4 months old. He is still a little shy of reaching everything but he love the bouncing and jumping. It is anything but portable and trying to move it when folded is sort of like trying to move a wet noodle. It just tips and spills everywhere. It takes two people to move it. All in all - I highly recommend it but just wish they would do away with the false advertising on the one toy."
5,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"Love this toy, I put my son in this jumper around the age of 5 months He absolutly loves it. He is now a year old and will still play in it. Out of three children I would say this is the best toy that I have boughten. Well worth the money. He played in it for hours in it."
4,"Very great toy - But, hard to move","Our 6 month old loves this bouncer! The only issue we've had is, it's kind of heavy and awkward to move from room to room."
3,"so so!,","my daughter does not like it very much... the sounds are annoying ,,, it takes a lot of space and it does no worth it!!!"
5,GREAT!!!,"We received this over a month ago for our now five month old daughter. She has so much fun jumping around in this, I have to stop her after a while. Her leg muscles and ability to roll around on the floor have also really improved since using this. My daughter now stares at this and cries to go in it if we don't plop her down inside right away. Even though you only use this for a couple of months, it's a life saver. I plan to pass this one down to another neice or nephew."
5,Wish I bought this sooner!,"My 5 month old son loves this jumperoo! I wish I had bought it when he was a little younger. He very active and does not like to nap. This is the only way I can get anything done around the house. He will happily bounce for a half an hour in his jumperoo. If I didn't make him get out of it for tummy time and other activities, I'm sure he would stay in it even longer! My only complaint would be that the seat seems difficult to turn so he can get to the other toys. I'm not sure he will be able to turn it on his own, but we will see what happens as he gets older. He loves all of the toys and making the music play."
4,"My kid hates this, but","I bought this for my kid and he hates it, but I recognize that is a function of my kid and not of the product. It seems like a really neat toy to me and I would think I'd enjoy it if I were a kid. Still, know your child, parents. If they're not into flashy lights & music, jumping, etc., this may be as much of a waste of money for you.My one concern is that the music doesn't seem to play when you think it would. Ours doesn't always play when he jumps or when he bats at certain toys. It seems random and that doesn't seem conducive to anything."
3,Quality componentsboring toys,"After purchasing the Luv U Zoo and literally returning it the same day, I orded the Rainforest Jumperoo (from Wal Mart for $76).I love the durability of the structure, instead of a cheap plastic frame like many others. This has a sturdy aluminum base and a comfortable seat. My 5 month old son's chubby thighs fit with no problem. He enjoys jumping in it, but the toys are sooooooooooo boring! Yes, it has lights and music and the chair swivels, but the toys lack creativity. If the toys were more interactive, I think my son would enjoy it more and I would have rated this with 5 stars. Overall, this is a quality jumperoo, just boring."
4,He jumps and jumps and jumps!!!!!,"My 6 month old son really enjoys this jumperoo. The toys attached draw his interest and he plays with them, oh yes and he jumps and jumps and jumps. My only worry is that I'll soon have to retire it because I already have it at the highest setting and I think his feet impact the floor just a little too hard, so I actually double a thick blanket under it to cushion his impact. The Jumperoo states that it's for use for babies up to 25 lbs; well my son weighs 22 lbs and like I said in my view he impacts the floor just a little too hard already at the highest setting. So beware for heavier or tall babies.This aside though he really enjoys it and it most definitely strengthens his legs; I definitely think its a good buy."
5,Awesome Buy!,"I bought this product about 5 weeks ago an it has worked awesome! My baby absolutely love this thing. All of the fun features on this product makes it easy to keep my baby entertained and saves me a headache! Any product that can do that I have no other choice then to give a FIVE STAR! I have already recommended this to all of my friends. Simple to use, Quality product, My baby loves it=Perfect PRODUCT."
5,Great Jumperoo,Got this for my daughter and now that she is big enough to use it she just loves it. I love the different settings so it can grow with her. The different toys all around keep her entertained for a long time.
3,Arrived already open with a broken part,"Box arrived opened with the Dragonfly toy broken. Didn't want to disassemble it and incur return expense, so we'll see if Amazon or Fisher-Price will just send me the replacement dragonfly to make amends."
4,Great Product,We purchased this item for our 3 month old daughter. She can't reach the floor yet but does fine with a box under her feet. She LOVES the lights and frog/parrot that hang. The only drawback is that she's fairly small (12 lbs) & it's already somewhat difficult to get her out of the seat.
5,Freaken Awesome,"This is our baby girl's favorite toy in the whole wide world. No home is complete, and no baby is truly happy without one. Smiles, jumps, laughs, squeals, jumps .... Great video potential too."
5,Awesome for our 4-month old!,"We have a very active little guy who's only 4 months. We wanted him to be able to be able to wiggle and jump while still have his back supported. This jumperoo is PERFECT! He can jump and play with the toys for about 20-30 min at a time now, and we still feel like he's safely supported! This is one of the best things we've purchased for our little guy!"
4,Some Product Pictures are Misleading,"Let me start by saying that I love this bouncer. My little guy could hold his head up by two and a half months, so we tried the bouncer then and he absolutely loved it. The lights and sounds on the toys make him smile and giggle every time. And it's great that you can remove the seat cover and throw it in the washer and dryer as the baby likes to coat it in drool. The reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is because many of the products photos show the ""dragonfly toy"" as standing straight up. So, I thought that there was some kind of spring inside of it to keep it upright. Nope. When we assembled the bouncer, the toy just flopped over on the side. I called Fisher-Price about the issue and they stated that ""the photos are wrong"" and that it is supposed to lay over the side. Aside from the misleading info, I would definitely recommend this product... And so would my son!"
3,"Not bad bouncer, but found better","We bought two bouncers. This one and the Evenflo Exersaucer. My son is now 9 months and a little tall for his age. He is too big for this one, but still comfortably fits in the Exersauser. He also has always liked the toys around the exersauser more, so for a little more money, I think it's worth the investment to get the other one."
4,A Fun Toy,"My daughter is 4 months old and loves this jumperoo! Her whole face just lights up whenever we put her in it. I think she'll have even more fun as she gets older and is exploring more. The only complaint I have with this product is that it's somewhat difficult to get her in the seat. You pretty much need 2 people to do this. One to hold the baby and the other to guide her legs into the seat. A couple of times her legs have gotten caught and she cried in discomfort. Other than this though, we are very pleased with this product and definitely recommend it!"
