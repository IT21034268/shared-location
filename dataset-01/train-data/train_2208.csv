3,Good but not Excellent,"Installation was a breez. Instructions are easy to follow (though I could have done a better job). Printer port has the problem that it will not match well with all printers specially the multi task printers. This is not mentioned on the box nor in the features listed here in Amazon and you won't find out until you dig into their site to solve your problem(after wasting time). I selected this brand for its printer port but I was disappointed since I have lost my HP Officejet printer interactive capabilities, scanning, faxing, maintenace, etc. I have ended up with an ordinary router and a dumb slow printer.I don't know how others measure up, but I feel betrayed."
2,BEWARE! - Great Product but don't have a problem.....,"I purchased an SMC7004BR in March and it worked fine until two weeks ago when the WAN routing portion decided to quit. Don't get lulled into thinking SMC's advertised 24X7 support is a reality and their lifetime warranty easy to take advantage of. I have spent over 4 hours on 3 separate occasions, at different times and days, trying to get through to their support to obtain an RMA (Return Authorization - to get the device repaired or replaced)for repair unsuccessfully. I sent an email to them requesting an RMA and was instructed I could only get an RMA by phone. I finally had to buy a Linksys router to get back in service. I continue unsuccessfuly to get through to SMC support. BEWARE"
1,This router only works one way.,"This router's only advantage is easy setup with web based setup menu. The basic setup took about 10 minutes (firmware upgrade and basic setup of booting router and booting your PC). But if want to run a web server behind it, forget it. I tried for the past 5 days with numerous contacts with SMC's tech support (they even elevate my problem to their Level 2 (don't know who they are yet)). The router won't enable port 80 to allow outside (WAN IP) IP addresses to see my web page. I ran some port scanning tools and found that port 21 was the only port that was opened (even though I had enabled 20, 21, 23, 80, 110, 119). The scariest thing was that I then disabled all ports via the router's setup page but port 21 is still opened!! This is no firewall and [...]"
2,Bad news...,"1. Basic routing worked ok.2. Dial-on-demand doesn't. There is a poor workaround, but it results in lots of unwanted connect time and it's buggy. Numerous firware upgrades since product release, but the product still won't actually perform this basic function with a modem.3. To avoid unwanted connect time, the unit must be configured so that all users must have administrative access in order to manually initiate dialing. Very insecure.4. Administrative interface poorly designed and buggy.5. Print server is extremely slow. Useful only for simple text printing. Won't operate bi-directional with Win ME so you can't use the features of a ""smart"" or multi-function printer.6. Tech support is horrid. Non-response to some e-mails. Responses to others did not show professionalism or much technical knowledge. Seemingly no organized way to track issues on SMC's end."
2,Doesn't Work with Windows Messanger Voice,"I bought this router because the website states that it will work with Windows Messanger Voice communication. It does not. I tried every suggestion on the FAQ on the SMC website, including placing the router in the DMZ zone. Nothing worked. I emailed SMC's technical support three weeks ago, and was ignored.If you do not need the voice/video of Windows Messanger or similar programs, the router works ok. That is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star. If you want to use voice/video communications, look elsewhere."
5,Great Product,Very flexible device. I was able to setup the router automatically when I plugged in the RJ-45 cable from the cable router it worked perfectly. Setting up the printer connection was very simple. I also have the router connected to an access point which works perfectly. The connections are all very quick and the status lights in the front work perfectly This is a very solid product which deserves the five star that I gave it!! Hope the review was helpful.
2,Poor Customer Service,"I tried to call the technical support 1-800 number for more than an hour and I wasn't able to talk to any technician. The automated telephone system kept on telling me that ""They are having a high call volume"" and then it would HANG UP. I kept on doing this FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR???? What kind of service is this?It has been almost two hours and I still cannot talk to any technician. This is ridiculous......This is the very exact opposite to LINKSYS......With Linksys, I could talk a technician with almost no waiting time. I mean it is like RIGHT AWAY SERVICE. Now, that's what I call EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.......This product has smooth setup. Just Plug-and-Play and you are connected to the Internet. But exposing the PORTs to the WAN has been challenging. It hasn't been as easy as the Linksys product.In short, customer service/support for this product is poor."
5,Extremely easy installation,"The product does what is says, in ten minutes out the box I was setup. Including the print server, my printer works just fine with Windows 2000 and XP."
4,Awesome,"Other than some minor compatibility issues, this product is wonderful. It does its job and it does it well. The bonus of course is the print server. Can't touch the price of this device with that additional option."
1,I can't configured the SMC 7004ABR router.,"HI, i have the manuel for the MSC7004ABR router to be installed with Rogers hi speed internet, but can't seems to get it working.I spend almost five hours trying to get the router to work but no luck. I will like in details how to configured this router with windows 2000 professional.Note:I wouldn't be able to rate this product quite yet because i have no experience working with it.Thank you."
2,Frustrating - but great when not dropped,"When this thing works it is wonderful. Great for networking and as a print server. Real easy to configure.Unfortunately it drops my cable internet connection ALL THE TIME. Probably averages 1-2 times a day, I have to crawl under the desk unplug it and then plug it back in. It would not be so bad but some days it will do it several times in a row, or it will not reset as I unplug it repeatedly. This is a HUGE waste of time and super frustrating.... I tried to save some money but the reliability ..."
2,Lowered my rating,"I originally gave this product five stars, but I have to lower it to two. This router has a problem that slows it down considerably after several hours of use. This requires frequent resetting or restarting, which is quite inconvenient.And even worse, SMC's technical support department has completely ignored four email requests for assistance that I have sent them over the last three weeks. All I have gotten from them is a couple of auto-responses telling me how important customer service is to them.Overall, this product is disappointing, and I wish I'd bought one from a different manufacturer."
2,Not Good for Server,"This product is not good if you have any server application that you want to expose to the WEB. First of all, this does not support loop back. For example, you cannot access your own web server using the the WAN IP address. You have to use the LAN IP address to access/test your web server. I mean why not??? This is just an example. I also have been experimenting my other ports exposing to the WAN and it is a pain. Some don't even work.If one of your purpose of buying this product is server related, this product would not be a good buy.But if you want to just share internet connection, this product is good enough, just good enough.And also technical support is also NOT good."
3,Gone but not forgotten,"SMC won the battle, but lost the war. I bought this unit and used it happily for several months. Then, cable modem service provider interrupted service, and suddenly the SMC Barricade was never the same. I reset the unit; I tried the alternate modem connection option (and fried the external modem in the process). I went to the SMC site for help and found only a form for posting to tech support. Tech support did not respond for over a week. Meanwhile, neither did Amazon.com. I feel burned. So, I went to my local [store], picked up a Linksys product (live support 24x7). Fewer bells/whistles, but hopefully more reliable. I like the Barricade while it worked. But I won't go there again. P.S. - the Linksys seems faster (Model: BEFSR41 ver. 2 - Great instructions.)"
2,Customer Service?? NO!,"We bought this router a couple of months ago and have had intermittent problems with it ever since. Our big complaint, however is with SMC's help desk. They never pick up the phone!It just rings and rings. No messages, nothing. I would never buy an SMC product again."
1,Had to configure as STATIC on Dynamic ADSL,"Would'nt work with Cinti Bell Zoomtown dynamic IP ADSL. Tech support's (call in wee morning hours) last resort was to set 7004ABR as Static to the current IP address. Yeah, it worked, BUT I did'nt want to find out for how long that IP was going to be valid. Testing the LinkSys now, -works outa the box -- so far so good."
1,"Mine just doesn't work, period.","I should have listened to the guy at work whogot one and couldn't get his to work. (To befair, another guy at work also has one and his worksfine.) The set-up interface will not allow me tochange any of the default settings. Oh, it will letme set the options in the menu, all right. It simplyignores whatever my changes are, no matter what I do.Since the default is to use DHCP (for cable access)and I require PPPoE (for DSL use), I am unable to usethis device at all. Oh, and the ""help"" menu doesnothing at all on the box I got. I suspect I purchasedan item with a bad set of firmware. However, since Ican't get this stupid thing connected to anything, Ican't update the firmware. What a pile of junk.I don't doubt that some people get some of these towork, but I sure can't."
3,SMC barricade 4-port router,I purchased router in march 2003. It worked w/o problem but one day it hanged up 2 login for dial up through 56k extenal modem. 4 port switch part is still working. Factory says it is not repairable. I would like 2 know whether it is use-N-throgh item??? Please write 2 me.RegardsNawabnawabsingh@bigfoot.com
1,Terrible customer service,"I had a problem configuring my computer to the printer server (basically, I don't think that that default IP address in the instruction manual worked). I emailed a question and recieved on autoconfirmation of my email on March 6. As of March 22, no answer or real response. So I called customer service and was told I would have a 30 minute hold. I'm still on hold as of this writing and the timer on my phone says 50 minutes, 39 seconds"
3,Strange,"The movie was strange but amusing. I'm not sure what the whole point of the movie was, but the Imaginarium was pretty wonderful. Heath Ledger was a fine actor in the film - I never noticed what a good actor he was until he passed. Whimsical, and not boring. Vern Troyer also acted as a good comedic foil."
3,Doctor Parnassus.,This one is pretty wild. A GREAT show to see but I can't recommend to buy it for your collection.
2,A Big Disappointment :(,"The photos from this movie look great. The art department did a great job (This movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Art Direction and Costumes) but the story is SO boring! The pacing is awful, and the movie really doesn't make any sense. It's really amazing that the nonsense ""bet"" around which the entire plot revolves is never clear. Also, the really annoying thing is that the father doesn't make any effort to win the bet and save his daughter, which is the main point of the story. Granted, the scenes inside the imaginarium are cool looking, but ultimately pointless."
5,Amazing movie,"This movie really opens your mind. Amazing movie, I would suggest everyone get the blu-ray :) Has the best actors and is a true adventure to watch."
3,A FEAST FOR THE EYES,"A sometimes bizarre presentation that reminded me very much of Salvador Dali's paintings. Last role by Heath Ledger. It truly is a feast for the eyes but sometimes it loses track of the story plotting. If you like fantasy this is one to check out just for the special effects. If you don't like Terry Gilliam, well, you won't like this since he directed it. WHEN WATCHED: September; MY GRADE: B minus (B for special effects fans)."
4,Apparently this film confused people who thought they were watching the latest installment of the Batman franchise...,"Not at all ""artsy"" or pretentious, this playful twist on that age-old cautionary tale (I'll leave it to you to figure out which one) seems to have offended both lowbrow and highbrow viewers alike. At times style does threaten to overwhelm substance and while the film itself doesn't suffer for it, the tragedy behind the production tainted the experience for me, if only slightly. Still, it succeeded in putting a smile on my face and I suspect that is precisely what it was meant to do."
1,What the heck?,"If I could give this zero stars I would. I saw the trailer and it looked really interesting.... NOT! Throughout the whole movie I couldn't help but keep looking over at my friend and yelling things like ""What?"" or, ""I don't get it!"" Listen, please do not waste your time like I did, and watch a good movie. Its a shame that this was Heath Ledger's last movie, because I wouldn't want my last movie to be remembered as this one! It's terrible! I mean, there's nothing good about it. I can't think of anything that was good. No plot, a story that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and an ending that's as terrible as it's beginning. I don't know what else to say.... It's awful and a waste of time, I implore you to do anything but watch this movie. And if you insist upon doing the latter then at least rent it because you will feel so stupid and guilty for wasting your money buying it once you've seen it. Don't be fooled by the people rating this with 5 stars! What are they thinking?"
1,Do not rent or buy.,"Watch time bandits or brazil again, but do not watch this movie. It is a long wandering story that is not worth the time spent. The visuals overwhelm the story line and make it chaotic and at times completely nonsensical."
4,Interesting drama on the choices we make and the ramifications to others because of those choices.,What is real and what is imagination? How do our actions affect our and others' future? I liked it because it was entertaining and had a moral
2,"It looks cool, but overall I was almost sleeping through most of it.","This is one of those movies that when reading the case I thought was going to become one of my favorite movies. I was wrong. It is definately a different kind of movie which is usually what I like to see, new ground. It seems to me though, it is just weird for the sake of being as weird as possible. The story is kind of dull however and I was never really drawn in. I almost fell asleep. If you want to see some really awesome visuals, the like of which you've never seen rent or buy it, otherwise forget it."
3,Enter the Imaginarium,"I think the best word to describe this movie is ""surreal"".I *LOVED* the basic concept-- the theme of the importance of imagination and storytelling-- but something about the plot and storyline doesn't quite work for me, and I can't put my finger on it. Without going into spoilers, I think I was not so happy with the direction that the development of Tony's character takes, and above all with the details of Parnassus' final bargain with 'Nick'. I also felt there were one or two loose ends left hanging."
3,"not the best, but far from the worse","I'm not a big fantasy fan, but I watched this because of Heath Ledger. He was, as usual, funny and so very talented. What I can't understand is why Heath has blue eyes in the special features. Really strange, but he would have looked great with blue eyes."
3,The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus - Blu-ray,"Directed by: Terry GilliamStars: Heath Ledger, Johnny DeppRunning time: 122 min. PG 13 - 2009Despite never partaking in illegal narcotics in my life, I am guessing a little while viewing would have helped me understand this film. This movie is most famous for being actor Heath Ledger's last film before he died. The visuals are very stunning and the music is outstanding. The plot? From what I could tell, a traveling theater group run by the immortal Doctor Parnassus must try to out smart the Devil who is after Parnassus's daughter. Ledger,along with Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law all playing the same role try to help the Doctor right many of the wrongs of his past. Mini-me is in it too. This movie is not for everyone, especially sober people.Huh?"
2,Disappointing.,"I don't know how to describe this movie except to say that it was vague, nonsensical and boring. The characters were far from endearing and the story was rediculous. I was terribly disappointed with the whole production. It seemed like it wanted to be something great but didn't know how to get there. Sad."
2,Heavy Sigh,"I hesitate to dump on Terry Gilliam, because his movies offer such opulent eye candy.Still, I cannot overlook the paper-thin characters and flimsy plot on display here. This film feels like a very feeble retread of the much better ""Adventures of Baron Munchausen."" And many found that film a trifle in itself.I'm afraid I must suggest to Mr. Gilliam that if he can't conjure better stories and characters, he would do better to create works of art in a static medium, like paint or graphics, and leave film to better storytellers.This film is worth a rental just for the eye-popping visuals, but not a purchase IMO."
3,Parting is such sweet sorrow,"Stunning visuals, wonderful performances, and an intriguing premise--nothing new really for a Terry Gilliam film. However, all those combined still don't add up to a story that really goes anywhere or has a real point, which is sadly ironic for a film that attempts to extol the virtue of a good story. Too bad the film didn't take its own advice."
2,Not Gilliam's best effort,"Unfortunately, this movie is fairly typical of Terry Gilliam's movies. It has moments of some very cool visuals and interesting characters but the story is disjointed and vague. It seems like he was never really sure on where he wanted to go with this movie and as a result it just kind of meanders from one scene to another without any clear connection between them. If you like Gilliam's stuff, you'll probably like this but I classify this movie as a renter, not something I would own and watch repeatedly."
3,Ok then...,"Some movies are a bit of a mind game, this one was a bit slow and the game wasn't that fun. I liked the characters, the actors and the movie was pretty but by the end of it I really didn't care about any of them getting anything they wanted (heck, I wasn't sure what half of them wanted) It was pretty and if I get really bored I might go back and see if there is a directory commentary for this one and see if there was a point to any of it."
5,Fellini for this century,"This film, especially the beginning, reminds me so much of the best of Fellini. The sights and sounds wash over the viewer, and pull him along. Hard to say what Fellini might have done with CGI, and a decent budget, but I think it would have been something like this. One can look for symbolism, and find it, or just go along for the ride, and have a great time.So many films start off with promise, but have no pay off. This film delivers, if you have patience."
5,Better the Second Time Around...,Liked the movie in the Theatre. Loved it the second time around. Wanted the time to stop and start at will. You can miss things seeing it in the movie theatre.
2,Failed Execution,"I found the concepts and ideas behind ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" interesting, and I found the film itself visually intriguing. However, the execution of the story is downright sloppy, and it was made more so by the untimely loss of Heath Ledger. I am hoping this disaster fades from memory quickly."
3,Imaginary reality,"The Imaginarium of Doctor ParnassusThis movie is relatively good for adults, not for children. It is good for thinking, but at times hard to understand. It is about Dr. Parnassus who makes a deal with the devil. As a result the doctor lives for hundreds of years, supposedly, and introduces people to alternate realities. Near the end of life, he made a deal that he would have to give the devil his daughter at the age of 18, he realizes that this was a mistake. The good doctor thought that having a family, and living a long time, he got the better part of the deal. He found out near the end of his life, that there is such a thing as living too long."
5,Fun Movie,"This was one of those fun movies, at least that's what I call them. If you are stressed out and just want to grab a glass of iced tea and a bowl of pop corn and want to enjoy a night of not having to deal, then this is a movie for exactly that. It has a cast of crazy character's that are so much fun to watch. I will watch it again and again and enjoy it over and over."
3,a movie,low price and great shipping on product. Not the best movie out there with Heath Ledger in it as far as movies go. The product itself was great.
4,A fascinating view into a beautifully imaginative story,"We had rented Dr Parnassus for a family movie night, and were blown away by the vibrancy, the color, and the imagination captured in each frame. It truly was an invigorating experience, and had my entire family quiet, openmouthed, and staring at the screen (which trust me, is a feat in and of itself, usually family movie nights are a cacophony of side conversations, laughter, dogs barking, and the movie buzzing in the background). When I saw this ""behind the scenes"" Prime, I thought it would be a perfect way to wind myself down after a long day at work - I figured I would put it on in the background and clean the house, but ended up sitting down and actually watching it.It's a beautiful behind the scenes look, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the movie."
4,Very entertaining....,"Finally we are given a movie, that does'nt follow the hollywood rules that mostmovie are following these days...violence...sex...guns and gore. If you ever likeMonthy Python material, you will be in for a treat.Terry gilliam brought us great stuff before...and he's at it again. What a imagination this guy has. All characters are interesting and do a great job.There's no one saying ...hey look at me...im the best... me me me.Nope, we have a great little bunch of actors/actresses that brings this movie tolife. Good for johnny depp, jude law and collin farrell to have helped Terryto finish this movie.... They did such a good job, that i did'nt even noticewhen heath final scene came and then was replaced by them....they all looked likeheath's character for this movie...now that's great acting.So get ready for your imagination to be jump started, get your popcorn and enjoythe show."
3,The Boredom Of Jay :(,"I thought this would be a great movie. I really did based on the trailers advancing this movie. It looked smart, it looked funny, and it looked well done. This revelation was only to be true in the trailer because when I actually started to watch the movie nothing like this was born out. The good material from the trailer was the only the only two- minutes of anything worth watching. Well, anyway it was just slow and seemed poorly thought out as it was very, very hurky jerky. Just avoid it and do something better with your time."
2,"As much as i want to say yes, eh...no.","Being a huge fan of both Johnny Depp and Heath Ledger, and not to mention a love how should i say it...trippy movies? I saw the previews for this and was so excited. However as much as i want to say it was a great movie, it was not. Heath Ledger did a great job, but Johny Depp, Colin Farwell, and Jude Law only appear in the movie each for like 5-15 minutes. It was really a let down as at least i thought they were going to all have seperate rolls but, unless you have seen the movie you understand, they do not. The plot was very dull, but the visuals (when they finally came back after the movie would dull down for like 45 minutes) were pretty nice. But overall, big letdown."
2,Very Visual,"I found this to be very visual but also disappointing --- I simply don't understand or appreciate what the director was trying to say --- from what other people have said in their reviews, I guess I fall into the latter category of not quite ""getting it"" --- that's life..."
1,imaginarium of dr parnassus,"the arrival from the shipper was fantastic. the actual movie STUNK, its too bad heath ledger is gone."
1,A Big Rotten Egg,"Watching this movie was like being trapped in bumper car hell, buffeted all around by outpourings of chaotic acting energy, plotless action, and computer graphics best left to ""The Revenge of Roger Rabbit"". How can so many fine actors produce such a scrambled rotten egg?Long before this movie mercifully ends, we can guess that the devil will lose the bet, and the hero (not the villain) will get the girl. A predictable plot ending is an aspect of many movies, the fun is in seeing how the protagonists pull it off. Not so here. I couldn't care what happened to these characters, just that it happened quickly to end this viewing torture."
2,WHAT THE BARNICLE JUST HAPPENED?!?!?!?!,When I saw the trailer for this movie I was so excited. Big name actors and great special effects. I knew this movie would be a little different though just by the trailer.I don't know where to begin. I think there should have been some sort of disclaimer on the packaging saying it is recommended to be high or on strong prescription medication which I was neither. This movie is really out there and whomever made the trailer for this movie deserves some sort of award to transform the movie it is to the trailer that got me all excited.Acting is good but I felt myself always wondering what was going on and to be honest I still don't know what the movie was trying to portray.To be fair I was still somewhat intrigued by the movie but will never and I mean ever watch it again. I felt like turning the movie off and just watching the trailer and calling it a night.Go rent it if your really interested.
5,Congratulations!,"I was introduced tho this book by way of a customer where I work who is also a proud friend of Lauren Wolk's. I trust this woman's judgement and was so thrilled when I found it on the shelf and then for Those Who Favor Fire to be mentioned Mademoiselle! It is a fab read and I am having a really hard time putting it down as the characters are so believably real. I am half way finished and do not want it to end but I am so captivated by Rachel and Just Joe that I feel that I must go on. One word to Lauren Wolk, please write more books soon. A new fan eagerly awaits!!!"
2,Did I read the same book??,"As someone who lives rather close to the real town which was fictionalized in this book, I forced myself to get through the whole thing... and I found it to be ponderous at best, sexist at worse...Every bad thing that happens in the book is the fault of some man (I won't reveal the plot, but you won't believe how true this is), and every good thing a woman accomplishes is because she overcame the bad things some man did to her.Every stupid thing in the book is done by a man. Every clever thing said is said by a woman.Marketing this book to feminists could make it a best-seller."
5,I just love Peter Mulvey's music,"I was pleased to be able to pick up a pristine copy of an early Peter Mulvey CD. I may now have all of his published work. If he is near you for a live concert, do go hear him live."
4,Insightful and Well-Written,"I found Barbara Leaming's biography of Katharine Hepburn to be unique in that it does not begin immediately with Hepburn's birth. Instead, it starts with her mother and grandmother, and her father and uncles. In doing so, Leaming allows the reader, throughout the course of the book, to come to a better understanding of Hepburn psychologically, as opposed to just presenting facts related to career and private life. The bulk of the biography is devoted to Hepburn's relationships, including those with Howard Hughes, John Ford, Leland Hayward, and, of course, Spencer Tracy. For one more interested in details of Hepburn's historic career, this is not the most insightful book. But for those wanting a peek into the mystique that is the Great Kate, Leaming's biography is tantalizing and absorbing."
4,Hard to find,"This was sold at Sephora in the past but no longer. I like to be able to look at the one I am buying due to the inconsistancy from one to the next due to how its baked. I really like it for an al over powder, but wish this particular one had more pink and less dark brown."
3,Pretty Good but no INFORMATION that helps,This is a boring campaign w/stupid rules. Don't bother with it..
4,Good Phone,"This phone doesn't have Java and Mp3 capabilities, and it also does not have a camera. On the great side however, it is an unbelievably priced ""unlocked"" cell-phone! No service providers and no worries about reception...if you have a global sim card. You can call from anywhere to anywhere! I really like this phone, it is cool, very small, and it is not common."
2,Not good,"The cellphone is just 256 color screen.Doesnt have Java, email and much more options.yeah, is very cute but I found that were a little bit ""cheäp"" and very plastic. Is a slider style phone and in time it will slide up and slide down alone. I'm just saying is not like Kyocera SE47 ""slider"" phone or Siemens S56, that feels very good and solid, no matter of time."
3,Good episodes with eventually well known actors,"Three of the four stories in this DVD deal with war... and the one that doesn't is the best of all. In ""Judgement Night"" (Season 1) a passenger on a war-time ship has a premonition that the boat will sink at certain hour (cast includes James Franciscus). ""A Quality of Mercy"" (Season 3) is a powerful story about the horrors of the war, where a young liuetenant (Dean Stockwell) suddenly finds himself as a soldier on the enemy side, looking at things with a whole new perspective (the episode also features Leonard Nimoy). ""The Obsolete Man"" (Season 2) stars Burgess Merdith as a librarian in a society of the future that considers him obsolete - a great episode -. Finally ""The Purple Testament"", another war story, shows us an officer with the peculiar ability to know who is going to die in battle (this chapter could be a reference for ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose"", one of the best episodes in another Sci-Fi Classic TV Series, ""The X-Files"")."
1,This Book Sucks....!!!,"I thought this was gonna be another HOT read from Penthouse..NOT!! It's filled with stories from people who get off seeing other people get NAKED! If you're a peeping tom this book is for you:-) If you're like me and like erotica, hot and sex heated reads..pass this one up... BIG TIME!!!"
4,GO! JOJO!,"My daughter and I listen to this CD EVERYDAY in the car as we run errands. I try to listen to a radio station or one of my CDs, only to have her say, ""no no...jo jo"" Okay, we are now car dancing to JoJo AGAIN! We both have it all memorzied and love it. Very upbeat and keeps interest. Please make more!-Devin's Mommie"
4,Very cute cd!,My son watches JoJo daily and this cd is a cute representation of some of the songs from the TV show. The songs are short but entertaining. I agree that the Spotlight moment song should have been vocal - my son loves this one and will stop whatever he is doing to see it when the show is on. He doesn't recognize it without the words...
5,Subtitled version,Saw this film at film festival in NY in 1990's. It was subtitled in English. Best film I've seen in entire life. Saw it at least 3 times. Where can we get the version with English subtitles? Want my grandchildren and students to see this film in the US.
5,Replacement DK-5 Eyepiece,"Since this piece is so small, I decided to pick up another one and the price and availability from Amazon fit my needs.This is an exact manufacturer's replacement part and covers the eyepiece if you are taking long exposures or timed shots and keeps anything in the eyepiece from changing your shot. Used with my D7000 but also works with my D50 DSLR."
5,Great replacement!,Bought this eyepiece to replace the 1 that came missing from my used Nikon N75. fits like a glove & works great.Ordered & recieved the eyepiece in 1 week.Thanks Cameta Camera!
5,Nikon DK-5 Eyepiece Cap for the Nikon D5000,"Nikon DK-5 Eyepiece Cap fits my D5000 without any problems. This the part that comes with Nikon D5000 Camera. It fits fine and snug, easy to install and remove from camera without any problems. Hope this helps!"
5,Nikon eyepiece cover,Works really well at keeping the light from interfering with pictures when using the live action mode on your dslr. Handy and fits perfectly in the eyepiece of my Nikon D3100. Get one for yourself!
3,Works as well as any other carpet shampoo,"This works as well as any other carpet shampoo; however, it costs much more, so that's why it only gets 3 stars. Save your money and get a general cleaner."
3,overpriced,"This is a good product but it is no better that the ""ultra"" detergent that came with my hoover vaacum. Save a few dollars and buy the ""ultra"" carpet cleaner."
3,Added on to order,Purchased a carpet cleaner for my kids at college. Added the soap on so they did not need to go to the store and buy it. Works OK.
2,Allergy Caution: perfume scent,"The product page said it removed ""allergens"". It also says on the bottle ""removes allergens"". But it has a strong fragrance. Many people with allergies have reactions to perfumes and scents. Yes, it's a nice smell, but that's not the point. Using this fills a room with the synthetic perfume. This is the type of thing that can give some people bad headaches!I tried to find ingredients listed on the bottle before opening it but there was no list, just that phrase ""removes allergens"". I risked opening the seal to sniff it, and lost that gamble. I am disappointed. Why would there be perfume in an anti-allergen product? Now I have a huge bottle of useless-to-me shampoo.I am back online searching for the key words ""hypo-allergenic"" and ""unscented"". I feel the packaging/info is misleading to people with allergies. Cat and dog dander are not the only allergens!"
5,Works Great,Worked well on the pet stains we had on our carpet. Took all of them out and the scent used was excellent. The only problem we had was that my wife is slightly alergic to it.
4,"Nice product, but kinda pricey","This solution cleans fairly well, and leaves a nice scent behind, you will be amazed how much dirt comes up. You will want to reclean again in a few days, if your dirty tank was really dirty, means you still have lots of dirt still on your carpet. however, you could use a clear hot water tanks, with no added product to rinse over the carpet again, or add half of the original product of the first cleaning to go over the areas again.Wish these products were so expensive.And this hoover solution is hard to find at local stores."
4,Pretty decent!,"This works pretty well; the scent is ok, and it does a good job at getting up most pet messes. Not very good for general household stains in carpet, however."
5,Rave reviews,Highly recommend the Hoover Pet Formula Carpet Detergent. Use it weekly to clean carpets.
2,It doesn't smell that great and cleaning was okay,"The cleaning was about average. The smell was so-so, I found other cleaning solutions that smelled much better. And as far as the dog returning to the spot...he still did. Over and over again."
4,pet formula,works fine... i wouldn't say it is any better than any other cleaning formula but gets the job done.
2,It's an OK product!!,"I decided to get this particular detergent because of its claims that it would be great at eliminating pet odor. Well, after a single use, the strong smell of cat urine was still lingering. It did leave the room smelling nice and fresh initially, but as the carpet dried, the foul odor returned!!!!"
3,Not as good as the SteamVac Ultra,"Having tried both detergents, we think the SteamVac Ultra is a much better product (even on pet stains) than this product."
1,save your money,Please dont buy this video or any volume of it. I just watched a few minutes of this crap and felt like a sucker afterwards. I feel I have to warn people so they wont make the same mistake I made. I was expecting real fights and I got some setup bulls$%!*. This will dissapoint 95% of the people who watch this. The other 5% are idiots who think that jumping into a wall is fun. I would reccomend Ghetto brawls if you want to see some real fights.
3,Wrestling?????,Well I'm a liker of hardcore videos but sometimes when it's teenagers beating the heck out of each other with weapons gets sickening.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The map in of itself is good.Besides showing the land features it shows the marker location,and that's it. Nothing about what happened,etc.You still have to have a guide,or read the monuments,or get a Gettysburg CD to understand the battle. The printing is so small you almost need a magnifing glass to read it.This is not what I expected after reading the ""reviews"".Save your money."
4,Wow! Need I Say More?,"This wax reminds me of what ""Meguiar's Gold Class"" used to be. And I say ""used to be"" because Meguiar's has changed it's formula into a thin watery mess that hardly does a thing for your paint.On the other hand, MOTHERS is a thick wax with no watery mess that leaves your car looking wet. It almost looked as though someone had poured oil all over my car when looking at it in the sunlight because it just looked so wet and shinny.I've used Meguiar's gold class and extreme, Eagle 1 Nano wax, and Black Magic. If you take the time to apply an even coat and buff it out enough, Black Magic will look good; but Meguiar and Nano both seem to be useless. Mothers is the best."
2,Disappointing,"The stones and setting were nice, but the post was so short and clamp was so small that I couldn't wear them - had to give them away to a ""tiny"" person."
5,Great Bean dip,Pure comedy fun from a true comedic genius. There isn't anyone funnier than rubber faced Rowan Atkinson who is todays Buster Keaton and Stan Laurel all wrapped up in one package.
5,FUNNY FOR ALL,"MR. BEAN IS ONE OF THE ALL TIME FUNNY PEOPLE. THESE ARE SOME OF HIS VERY BEST. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS THE TERROR ON THE HIGH DIVE, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY FUNNY ONES IT IS HARD TO PICK. KIDS LOVE HIM TOO. MUST HAVE."
3,Best bits of bean is literally made of bits.,"The video is full of small bits of episodes, not full ones but it is still funy."
5,Good Choice,"This is a great DVD for ""Bean"" fans of the earlier stuff. We laughed hysterically. Rowan is genious in these great BBC shorts. Great compilation."
5,Worth the money,"For $6.99 you're gettting a good deal, not a lot of episodes but all are hilarious. I think that big fans of Bean will probably own the complete TV series on DVD, but this is a good introduction."
2,Christmas is not complete...,"Part of our Christmas tradition is watching ""Merry Chritams Mr. Bean."" Unfortuantely, this DVD includes only part of that classic episode. It's back to the VHS ""Merry Mishaps of Mr. Bean"" for another Christmas. How disappointingly analog."
3,mr. bean is available in Australia,"I don't know if they intend to release the complete episodes in the US, but the series is being released in Australia. These are region 4 PAL dvds-you must have a multi region player with a pal converter. So far there are 4 dvds with 8 complete episodes. EZY dvd has them."
4,A Book of Hope for Mothers,"This book not only celebrates the beauty of motherhood, it reminds those of us how special our mothers really are."
1,Could be better!!!,"Brush was shipped 5 days after order was placed. Charge for shipping was $7.99 (more than price of brush) and it was sent by USPS, not UPS. Brush is okay but could be better. Totally unacceptable."
2,My dog loves it - but the music is SOOOO LOUD + update,"UPDATE -- after 5 daysMy labradoodle, weighing only 22 lbs, has plucked the yellow fuzzy off the side of the cake and been eating it. I noticed it after a few minutes and took it away from her.I had to take it away from her because I was afraid she'd get sick... wasn't a great investment after all.**********************Just received this plush toy. My 9 month old labradoodle just loves it and she won't let anyone touch it.She quickly learned to bite on the right spot to play the music OVER and OVER again, and it is just SOOOOO loud. After an hour, I had to take it away from her, open it up, wrap the music player in a sheet of packing material and put it back so I can avoid my husband throwing it away 'by accident'.I know plush toys made for dogs don't last too long, but I hope this one last a long time as my dog just loves it so much."
5,Multipet Plush 5.5-Inch Musical Birthday Cake Dog Toy,My dog has so much fun with this toy! He plays with it on and off all day and still hasn't torn it to pieces.
5,Happy Birthday Cake Dog Toy,"My dogs love this toy that I bought them for their birthday. They know how to make it play ""Happy Birthday"" so I can sing. What a hoot!"
2,Birthday cake dog toy,"I purchased this toy for our golden retriever on his first birthday. He absolutely adores plush toys, especially those that make noise, so I thought this would be a great birthday gift. The toy itself is very cute, though he managed to put a hole in it after five minutes. The real problem is the TERRIBLE music maker. It plays at a very high pitch, which must have hurt his ears, because he cried anytime it began to play (which was every 90 seconds as he tried to chew it, and the song plays three times every time you hit the music box). I finally cut a slit in the side with the music box and pulled it out. He's content now chewing it and pulling out the stuffing, but we were both miserable so long as the music box was in."
3,So annoying!!!,"Oh my gosh, once the batteries died in this, I thanked God. Hearing the birthday song over and over again about killed me..."
4,Our pet's favorite toy,Our dog picked this out as her favorite toy. It has to be with her in the kennel or out in the living room when she can roam free. It plays happy birthday if you bite it in just the right spot. Thankfully she doesn't find that spot too often.
2,The first 24 hours are great!,"My boxer LOVED this toy when she got it! She was gentle with it and just carried it around, content to listen to the music. But 24 hours later, the music has completely died and you can tell how sad she is that her favorite toy doesn't work anymore. This was just from gentle play and pushing the music box maybe 30 times at most. It's a shame they didn't use the same sound box that the Mr. Bill dog toy has--three years later (of rough play), he's still going strong! This toy let me down and I'm not sure I will get it for her again next year because of the disappointment level and also it's too expensive for one day's use of play."
1,GARBAGE!,"These readers are about as good as a mood ring for taking temperature. The directions even say ""If a fever is indicated, always verify the extent of internal temperature with a clinical thermometer"". How about just start with a thermometer that works?!? Don't waste your money!"
5,Mabarak:mexican classic and teacher of mexican classics,"Jimenez Mabarak was borned on Mexico Ciy at 1906. He was a prolific compositor of all types of the classic music. He intented -and obtained- to access at the soul of mexican spirit source the ""good music"" (classic music), and wrote all the kinds of classic music: balades, corals, simphnys, symphonic concerts and concerts for trumpets, opera, etc. The work of Jimenez Mabarak have the energy, coloring and mysticism of mexican people. Teacher of many generations of compositors, Jimenez Mabarak must be listened and studied."
2,Different movie has been delivered.,"By mistake I've got a different movie. The seller allowed me to keep the DVD I've got and promised to send the good one. Unfortunately, I have not received it."
2,First one broke,"nice, but the first one broke, so I ordered a new one. While waiting for the new one, I fixed the old broken one, which is now better then the new one. But it does not swivel, which is great for me."
2,What you pay for.,"I'm pretty gentle with all my stuff-- annoyingly gentle as far as my wife and friends are concerned. This still broke on me after about three weeks. It was cheap, though, so knock yourself out and buy 10 or 12."
5,Phone clip review,"This phone clip is one probably the best one there is on the market. It allows you to use it without taking the phone out of the clip, lessoning the wear and tear on it. Thats why I give it a 5-star rating."
1,misled on purchase,"When I purchased this product the advertisement led me to believe that I was purchasing item VX8300 LG Verizon Black Swivel Belt Clip Holster packed 2 each. Instead I only received one. This ad very misleading and I would, therefore be reluctant to purchase from this distributor or through Amazon again."
5,Indispensable to the Old West lover's library,"Novelist and historian Wellman here provides an indescribably superior one-volume story of the range-cattle business that reads as easily as fiction. Beginning with the Spanish roots of the Southwestern cattle ranches, he goes on to tell something of the early Anglo settlement of Texas, the troubles with the Comanches, the ""hide-and-tallow empire"" built up in antebellum days, the effects of the Civil War, the clashes with the Kansans, the founding of Abilene. He talks about stampedes and what was done about them, great trail towns and their lawmen, lean years and fat ones, the cowboy's work and play, and a gallery of unforgettable Western characters, good, bad, and indifferent. He studies the Lincoln County War, the coming of ""bobwire,"" and why cowmen hated sheep. There is information I got from this book that I've found nowhere else. You will say the same. Every lover of Western social history should be glad to see it back in print."
4,"Good game, very unique plot.","This game is very addicting. The game may not have the most pivitol graphics but the storyline is very interesting and keeps you hooked. The characters are also very interesting and are varied, from a robot dog to a ninja. You will definitly enjoy this game."
5,baby orca,Great product. Used for educational purposes on endangered species. Perfect size for younger kids.
3,No that bad,"I did not know what to expect from a ""Mormon"" movie. This was recommended. Maybe closer to Utah these are funnier, but I did enjoy it and I don't feel that it was a wast of my time. As a LDS person so far away from Utah it seems like a nother planet, the humor sometimes takes a minute or two for me to figure out."
3,Gary Coleman Movie But...,I bought this DVD mainly because of the late Gary Coleman and the time he met his wife. I tried seeing it from the beginning but something may be wrong with the disc. I am not sure but I would keep trying to play it.
1,"If Kurt Hale had any respect for the movie making industry, he would retire.","Just as all Halestorm movies, this one blew. And sucked. And blew a little more. Embarrassingly enough, I was an extra in this movie, and I know from first hand experience how unorganized and cheap the production of this movie was. I couldn't tell if the time period was in the 70s, 80s, 90s, or recently took place in Eastern Idaho. And not only is it another lame and over-the-top Mormon satire, it's a complete knock off of Dodgeball (which was hardly mediocre at best).To sum it all up into one word--- Barf."
3,I expected it faster,"The product was not exactly what I expected - I thought the bottle was a bit bigger, but I got the smallest thing ever"
1,Beware Kindle Edition!,"I was so excited to see this resource available for Kindle - but there are some major defects. First, one of the best aspects of the NIV study Bible is the excellent concordance. Surprise, no concordance in this edition. But even worse, I prefer the 1984 text, which it also lists as having. But no, once it's downloaded, hey presto, you find out it is the 2011 version. This article at [...] describes how the current ""owners"" of the NIV translation are seeking to suppress the 1984 version and put a disguised gender-neutral version in its place. ""An examination of the text reveals that this new 2011 edition of the NIV is actually a minor revision of the TNIV, the gender-neutralizing revision of the NIV that was published in 2005."" NO THANKS! Oh NIV, how the mighty have fallen. . .Edward Goodrick must be spinning in his grave. Needless to say, I returned it."
5,Resource for DECADES..... and the Bible's good too!,"The reformed catechisms and confessions (complete with scripture proofs) in the back (WLC, WSC, LBC, WCF, TFU) alone are worth the price. Add onto that the fact that the study notes have not only scriptural references, but also Confession/Catechism references, excellent articles by top notch Biblical scholars, great Bible study notes and you've got a classic you can use for decades.I'm not a big fan of dynamic equivalency translations, and the NIV is about 60% literal, 40% dynamic. But it's been growing on me lately. I still supplement it with my MacArthur Study Bible, which is NKJV.I'll still give it 5 stars, but they need to make an ESV version."
5,Good layout,"Lots of people have commented on the commentary, but also should mention that the layout is very ""clean."" Easy to read and access. Good production quality."
5,"Got it yesterday, used it in church today.",I like the idea of having a Catechism in the back of a Study Bible. I wonder why Zondervan stopped publishing it??
1,Ugh,"If you don't mind music that sounds like a bad MIDI, go ahead and buy it. It would probably be okay if Yo Da Man used some modern technology. As said before, stick with Meco."
3,Just an ok reference,"A big fan of the ""What to Expect"" series, I purchased this book for my 12 year-old daughter who is planning to begin babysitting soon. I immediately noticed that it is spiral bound (as stated in the description) and seems pretty flimsy, like the pages could very easily tear out. Upon closer inspection, I was disappointed to see lots of information for nannies or even daycare workers in the book and very little useful information for a beginnning preteen/early teen sitter. I would look into other babysitter handbooks before purchasing this one - it is definitely not up to par with other books in this series."
3,"Great for Nannies, Not for Aunts","I borrowed this book from the library in hopes it would help me out with some issues I've had babysitting my niece, which I do on the occasional weekend. It is interesting, and it gave me a few ideas, but it was clear from the start that the book is geared toward full-time babysitters and nannies. It doesn't even mention the weekend/evening out babysitters like me, and it only covers ages 0-6 (my niece is only 10 months, but if she were older, I would have been even more disappointed). It does have a few good ideas when it comes to playtime, bath time, and going out, but it didn't help at all with my niece's getting-to-sleep-in-a-strange-bed problem.Overall, it's a great book for nannies, but not for me."
4,Original and Interesting,"Very original approach to an alternate future where ""violets"" solve violent crimes.Interesting writing, easy going. I would read it againI RECOMMEND IT!"
5,a great new paranormal author,"People can now talk to the dead: via the Violets, people born with violet eyes. Violets are rare, and have the natural ability to channel the spirits of those who are dead. The government, of course, has jumped on this bandwagon to regulate this `gift', and there is a `School' for the violets to attend once the dead start `knocking'. The story begins with Natalie Lindstrom, a Violet, testifying in a murder trial. FBI agent Dan Atwater is supposed to bring Natalie in on a case that is close to home for her - a serial killer has targeted Violets. Natalie channels the dead Violets, but all she finds is that the killer knows the ways of the Violets, and that she is on his list."
4,Thoroughly Enjoyable Read!!!,"Great story, well-written, engaging characters!!! Looking forward to more titles by this author!"
5,You will Believe,"Stephen Woodworth takes a familiar concept you've seen in movies and on television, twists it enough to make it his own and creates a compelling read that you won't be able to put down. I have suggested this book to several people and none have been disappointed. Stephen made me believe his character's powers were genuine. It's the kind of book that will make you look at everyday objects differently. As an author, I often know where a book is going and what the author is trying to accomplish. This book keeps you guessing to an ending that is just masterful. Through Violet Eyes is one of my favorite contemporary books!CJ WestAuthor,Taking Stock,Sin And Vengeance"
5,Great book! Unlike anything I have ever read!,"I am now a true Stephen Woodworth fan! This was the first book by this author I have ever read, I loved it! Very different look at the paranormal life! Upon completing this book. I ran to my local bookstore and got on the list for the second book, With Red Hands. From the glimpse I got of it, it looks like a page turner, also. I am counting the days til it is released!"
4,Excellent debut novel,"Before you start to read this novel, be sure you have about 5 hours' time to do so. While you're at it, make sure the lights in the house are on and you have an emergency phone at your side.Yes, THROUGH VIOLET EYES is that much of a page turner. Dan Atwater is an FBI agent called in to investigate the deaths of Violets, folks born with violet irises who are conduits for the dead. He's paired with Natalie Lindstrom, a Violet who has already 'been visited' by several friends who have died at the killer's hands.Dan's off his game due to accidentally shooting an innocent man. Natalie's traumatized and bitter. They make quite a pair, but they get the job done.The one point I will take from this novel is the 'real' Bad Guy didn't really get destroyed. Save for a couple of flashes of brightness, this is a pretty grim world. Not to be read if you're feeling somewhat down in the first place!"
4,Through My Eyes,"One may look at the story summary on the back cover of Stephen Woodworth's debut novel, Through Violet Eyes, and shrug unconvinced of the quality that lies within. And why not? How interesting can yet another story about a secret agent teaming up with an attractive psychic be? Well this one is like nothing before it. Stephen Woodworth starts by drawing you in to the story slowly, and taking his time, page by page, to get you fully informed on what is going on. Then, in one fleeting moment, before you even really understand what's happening, you're hooked with no hope of recovery. Stephen Woodworth has this delightfully deceptive way of alluding to a certain outcome, and working up to it, only to end somewhere you never would have expected. Despite this, Through Violet Eyes is a window in to a possible world of tomorrow, full of desperation and marketable mutation. Luckily though, since this is only the first book, the intrigue doesn't have to stop here."
3,Someone's knocking,"I can't say this is the best book I've ever read, but it's engrossing, chilling and interesting. It's a traditional cop story with a paranormal twist and the idea of a spirit knocking on the mind of a violet when they want to speak just gives me the creeps. For a first novel, the author shows great talent.I could have done without the romantic subplot which is expected and a little hokey but I liked the resolution of the murders. I liked that the 'villian' had a reason for what he did, even if what he did was terrible. I did think the ending of the main characters' story was a little too hallmark channel for me, but maybe that's just me.The descriptions of the murders and the death scenes can be a little graphic (it didn't bother me but some people don't like that sort of thing so I thought I'd mention it).If you're looking for a different spin on a classic 'who done it' this is a good one to check out."
1,"Trite, shallow & boring","This book has all of the elements I detest in commercial fiction: it's sentimental, poorly imagined and lazily structured, full of stock characters whose emotions are about as uniquely expressed as cardboard. Never once was I able to forget that the author was trying to manipulate me with clumsy ""hooks"" at the end of every chapter. I also felt that this whole world was created from watching TV programs. By the time I got to the end all I felt was, So what? Don't waste your money. There are many other fine books out there that don't insult your intelligence."
5,A Personal Favorite from Way Back When,"I was searching for this title to include in a personal essay (fittingly enough), and after I found it, I felt compelled to write a review. My parents got me this book after I showed an interest in writing during late grade school. I loved it. I devoured the sections on fiction and play writing and would leaf through the appendix just for fun. I returned to this book over and over again through middle school. One creative writing degree later, I think it's safe to say this book works! If you have a kiddo who's interested in writing (or who's simply inquisitive in general), I highly recommend you purchase this book for them. It's a great way to get kids inspired while giving them a bit of direction."
4,good,this was the first crusty demons of dirt videos i saw and for my first impression i thought it was a 4 star kind of movie i mean these guys r just flat out crazy and if u want to see them do there stunts then u will want this movie trust me you will have no regrets.....peace*Devan*
2,Right idea but nothing compared to vol 2.,Ordered by mistake not realizing I had seen vol 2 in a shop. I sold it on ebay for $3. Personal opinion is that this one is lame. Buy vol 2.
4,"good advice but a bit much for a ""young"" novelist","The introduction leads one to believe this is geared toward a fourteen or fifteen year old potential writer. God knows it would have flown over my head at any time before my mid-twenties - both the intellectual discussions presented and the literary references made.It still shown a bright blazing light at my near complete ignorance of Spanish and Latin American novelists. But taken in the sense of ""young"" meaning ""beginning"" novelist, it was a good read with a lot of interesting viewpoints on the makeup of a novel."
3,Boomarang Joy,Good for the laugh you need when you are down and need a pick me up no matter what the reason for the depression or trouble going on in your life.
1,Didn't get it yet!!!! Sent to wrong address could you check on it please,Didn't get the book we have a po box and we live in Malden on Hudson Ny and apparently the mail service that is being used keeps picking up our address as the Town next door but we are in a hamlet of this town. I would really like to get all of the books that I ordered.
3,A Little Dated,"I bought this book years ago, when I was in fact in middle school. And as another reviewer pointed out the information is a bit dated. There are references to using chemicals for revenge that no one has access to any longer as well as other things that are soon to become anachronistic such as ""Sticking it to Ma Bell"" by sending voltage back through the phone lines. Additionally there are a few things that stick out as not being revenge at all, just tidbits of information that serve to pad the rest of the book, the ""rape harpoon"" comes to mind. Still, there are some good ideas in this book that range from the mundane to the outrageous and it's a fun read even if you're just out for some laughs."
3,Wow! Don't do what's in this book unless you plan on sitting in jail!!,"I bought this book after ending a bad relationship. Some of the pranks were really quite funny so if you have a good imagination (and that's as far as I was willing to go) it will serve out its purpose in thoughts! lol. However, most of the plans and pranks would definitely get you a lengthy jail sentence if you ever got caught! So if you buy this book, THINK VERRRRY HARD BEFORE YOU PUT SOME OF THESE PLANS INTO ACTION. AND AVOID OTHERS COMPLETELY!! You may be mad at someone but that will pass in time. If you get caught doing some of this, the jail time won't be even come close to being worth it."
2,so-so,This was not what I thought it might be. It is suprisingly not that entertaining to me but you may like it.
2,Kind of funny but outdated,I did a bunch of the stuff in here when I was in jr high. A lot of it involves tricks that can't be done due to today's technology.
2,WASTE OF MONEY,Most of the tactics are childish and do not allow the person seeking revenge to remain anonymous. This book is a waste of money.
5,Absolutely hilarious!,"This video is Mr. Bean at his best! His holiday antics are so incredibly funny, I find myself watching this one again and again. You'll never see Harrod's window display in the same light. From the turkey fiasco to Mr. Bean's holiday home decorating techniques, his musical talents, and his hidden romantic side, this video is priceless!"
4,Mr.Beans Merry Mishaps.,"The Merry Mishaps of Mr.Bean is a comidy the whole family will enjoy! Writen by Richard Curtis,Robin Driscoll,and last but not least Rowan Atkinson! Rowan Atkinson plays the histarical Mr.Bean. In Merry Mishaps Mr.Bean gets the turky stuck on his head while dinning with his girlfriend sone to be his ex. Then in Mr.Bean in Room 426 Mr.Bean locks hisself out of his apartment with out his clothes. Oh no! The rest you will find out if you see ""The Merry Mishaps of Mr.Bean""! Mr.Bean in room 426 also have guess star ""Danny La Rue"" Feachured."
3,Definitely not the size I was expecting......,"I have the Blue Moon dishes, and love them, so I was VERY excited to find this set when I needed a new sugar bowl. Imagine my suprise when it arrived, and I found the sugar bowl to be TINY. We actually use it for splenda, and use quite a bit, so this is all but useless for us. It is adorable, but useless."
5,Magnifique!!!,The aquamarine & diamond gold pendant is a marvellous and delicate item! I like it very much! The service is quick! I'm going to continue my experience with Silver Insanity firm!
1,"Awful, not at all worth the cost","This frame was the worst frame ever. The shipping cost more than the product and my goodness, it was not worth it. It was very unclassy, but was available in the size that we needed it, which was why we chose the frame. It was right above our bed and fell apart during the middle of the night. It was very difficult to put together. Probably the worst product Amazon could ever offer."
5,Great Movie,I just love anything with Betty White and this did not disappoint. Had an actual story that was enjoyable the whole time.
5,Annie's point,It is a great movie about how one couple love has lasted threw all the years... also Betty White was a GREAT actress to...
4,Annie's Point,"Really enjoyed this movie, showed a developing close relationship between a grandmother and her grandaughter. A road trip cross country brings the 2 of them closer"
3,Sweet but kind of boring...,"Have always loved Betty White and most of the time, enjoy Richard Thomas. While it was a good wholesome movie, just didn't rank up there with my Hallmark faves. Won't be harsh here, in honor to Miss White, but not the greatest."
2,Poor DVD,"Received item very timely. When watching DVD, it would keep stopping. Had to skip over a lot of the movie. Very displeased with quality of DVD. The price was cheap (guess you get what you pay for)."
5,Annies Point,This movie is a great family movie. I loved the closeness the granddaughter and grandmother had towards the end of the movie. I loved watching them develop a great relationship through out the movies as they made the trek to California.
5,Great self-help book,This is a great book that really gave me answers to many relationship questions. How do we talk to and get along with other people effectively and without so much stress? This book has the answers!Norma Novy
5,Clearing: A Guide For Professionals,"A very compact book here. There is no wasted info.I use the book as a solo practitioner, and although I have been solo clearing for many years this book picked up on things I had missed along the way. There are some wonderful rundowns and questions, and just about anything can be handled---it just takes some willingness (not even a lot). It is so simple, yet those who are drawn to it are in for a treat. Levin's contribution is immeasurable.Just his info on problems and quandries Is worth the price of the book."
1,StarTech.com REMOVABLE SERIAL HARD DRIVE ( DRW113SAT ),Received wrong item. Never got it This was a waste of my time. Amazon had the wrong item listed for this order.
3,Just ok...,"It is not too sweet, but for some reason it has a sour aftertaste, and much less ""praline"" than I had hoped for. Would not buy again."
4,Too sweet but kids like to eat it dry.,I'm pleased with the ingredients but too sweet in my opinion. My kids like to eat it dry.
4,Leeb's Thesis,"Not the first time that Dr. Leeb has expounded this idea, but well researched and clearly explained. He is often correct in his market insights."
2,skip this one,"The investment advice is based on the assumption that the ""coming economic collapse"" will be like the recession in the 1970s. Pretty unlikely, given that the causes are totally different. He just wants us to buy gold - who needs his book to hear this?This is a simplistic book with little to recommend it."
4,What you think of this book doesn't matter,"Here's the great thing about this book: It provides a point of view and creates awareness. It doesn't actually matter if you totally agree with Mr. Leeb - because even if he is half right we all need to pay attention to oil as a major factor as we invest.All signs - oil, baby boomer retirement, U.S. debt, the rise of China, the cost of enttlements - point to a tougher U.S. economy in the next 20 years. I think it's wise for investors to study all the big potential effects and balance that out with some of their own thinking. In that regard this book opened up another area that I will explore and understand."
5,"""I,m a believer.""","I agreed with his predictions for the future and his rationale for why he expects these events to occur. I don't have a business degree or business background, but overall found the economic concepts explained reasonably well in the book. The book overall is a fast read and kept my interest. I looked at what happened last year in my 401k plan when gas went from $2 to $3 a gallon and the two best performers were in the categories he had said to invest (but unfortunately I didn't have either of these in my portfolio then.) But they will be added soon, as I expect we'll see $4 to $5 a gallon gasoline within the next couple years for the reasons he stated."
4,Good,"I thought this book had some really good ideas on how to evaluate the level of economic stress from ongoing oil shortages, and offered some good thoughts on how take advantage of oil depletion. I not sure that all the ideas have worked out, but I think that the author has another book out and I would like to read it."
5,The Coming Economic Colapse,This book confirmed what I already thought and give ideas as how to survive the colapse/economic changes.
1,save your money,if you're up on the theory of peak oil you don't need to read this book you already know what you need to know nothing new here just more blah blah blah.alittle bit of woo- woo here and there and that's about it.
2,Every ill in the world can be attributed to energy,"I bought the audio book version and was only able to listen to about half of it. I couldn't finish it as it repeated itself constantly.Basically what I have taken from the author is that every civilization and empire that has failed did so because of energy supply problems. Forget corruption, forget fiscal irresponsibility or anything else just chalk it up to energy supply issues. Conclusion is the collapse of the American Empire will be the result of energy supply issues.The author constantly repeats himself throughout the book and it makes it really hard to finish."
2,"Not as good as ""The Oil Factor"". What happened to Berkshire?","Much darker than ""The Oil Factor"". I bought the book for updated investment strategies.We didn't get to that until 85% through the book and it was about the same as the Oil Factor with the notable exception of Berkshire Hathaway which had a whole chapter in ""The Oil Factor"". It was not even mentioned as an investment in this book. What gives?The authors just couldn't come right out and say ""We are done and it is over"" like Kunstler does in ""The Long Emergency"". For investment advice, the first book is much better and I would give it 5 stars. This book is like a rant by someone who just woke up to the really dire situation we face. Save your money and time and read ""The Oil Factor""."
2,Up side only view,The basic premise of the book is how you can stay warm through a very cold unending winter because your house is on fire. Let them not eat cake but gold and oil stocks. There are much better books on the subject of peak oil and energy depletion.
1,Poorly written,"The author is very arrogant, self centered, and thinks he is the only person in this country knowledgeable of the world economics."
1,You wish this were true,"$200 per barrel oil? Yeah right. You peak oil huggers don't have a clue. Let me give you a clue: Shale oil $20/b and a 100+ year supply, oil sands: $10/b and a 100+ year supply. Look it up. I could go on but you peak oil people are either not rational or not honest. In any case, do not use this book for investment advice!"
5,A great snowboarding movie,"This is the first snowboard movie I purchased but I can say it is the best I have ever seen. There is a bit of everything, freeride, rails and big airs - not too much of each. Very nice views and camera work is excellent. I really enjoyed this DVD and I can honestly recommend it."
4,Snowboarding,"This was a great snowboarding video. They did alot of crazy moves. Most of it takes place at major ski resorts. The out takes were funny, seeing all the professional boarders fall down the mountain. The backround rock music set the snowboarding mood. There are some moves that you probably won't see in other snowboarding videos. There are 18 different borders doing different stunts. This is worth buying. You could watch it over and over."
4,Cool Video!,"This video was really cool. The background music is from famous rock artists and the snowboarding moves they do are very daring. The huge vertical drops that they board are amazing. There's a variety of skiing sites including helicopter-drop mountains, terrain parks, and competitions. They ski Squaw Valley, Mammoth Mt. and Jackson Hole. The parts I liked best is when the boarders created an avalanche and skied ahead of it. There are alot of funny outtakes throughout the video that shows different skier mistakes and situations."
4,excellent dvd you will not be dissapointed,45 mins of excellent riding...only thing missing is a longer slam section. The picture quality is awesome. This is the first snowboard film I have seen on dvd and I am fully impressed. Would recomment to anyone who has a jones for boarding during the hot summer
4,Creative style...Cool watch...,This watch is definitely more of a show piece then a standard watch. It appears crafted out of a single piece of aluminum which is cool. Gets some complements but also some stares (thinking what is that ugly duckling). It is definitely on the large size but isn't heavy due to being made out of aluminum. It is a basic analog watch and has no date feature. I have many watches but for some reason I wear this one quite a bit. My only concern is what happens with the band wears out because it appears fused to the watch. A bit pricy for a basic watch but I like the cool factor. It is tough but the case does get scratched easily.
2,Roberto Quiros,"The watch is great and goods look anytime.But the strap's quality is very poor and becomes broken easily.I tried to replace it, and contacted nike.com for that, but nobody there answered my request. So I'm not able to use this watch anymore.If I knew about this, I would ratter to buy the version with leather strap or the one made of fabric, because both are replaceable."
5,Satisfied,"Expensive, but very good product!Guess you get what you pay for!Had many cheaper hose reels fail within the first or second year!"
3,RAPID REEL 225?,I NEED A HOSE REEL TO HOLD AT LEAST 200 FEET OF 5/8 HOSE. THE HOSE BARELY FITS. I'M SURPRISE THAT IT STATES 225 OF HOSE MAYBE 1/2 INCH?
2,Dangerous Towns,"30 Great Cities To Start Out In, written by Sandra Gurvis is completely insane. It is totally off. Chicago? What was she thinking! Living in Chicago is dangerous. Robbers and murderers are found throughout the city. It's a senseless place to live. Some of the cities that she chose to include are horrible, dirty places. Yet some of the other cities she included were above average cities that young people could not afford to live in. I think her book was only written and published, strictly to make money and that's it. -Thank You"
5,NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!!!,"This movie is great. It has all of the vandals old songs. They are do much better with dave quackenbush singing, too. DO not show this movie to anyon under 12. They would be ruined for life. This is just good punk"
5,Best Digger Album EVER,This is by far the best Digger album out there! This cd islike musical crack you start to listen to it and you cant stop. Theykick butt live! Every song on the cd is pure punk rock. The guitar work on it is amazing. Buy it!
5,this cd is a must-have!!!!,Digger is one of the greatest bands that I have heard in a long time. All of their albums are worth buying. I want my hat back!!!!!!
5,"digger, a pop-punk band, has catchy tunes and tons of talent","This is one of the best cds I have ever bought. All the songs are amazing. They are very catchy and eisly get stuck in your head. The best songs are boy toy days, i want my hat back, roolercoaster girl, and string in my throat.All of the rest of the songs are as good too."
4,"2""Louvers","The louvers works fine. The only small problem was the drilling of the holes used to seucure the louvers to the vent hole. The company should make holes in them which is easier than drilling them. Except for that, the louvers are good."
2,Below average Nimzo book,"I have read ""I play against pieces"" by Gligoric and thought that his Nimzo book would be at the same gold standard. It is not. The startegic ideas are not very detailed, and in return you get ""variations"".Definetely not happy!"
4,Shaft's Favorite Album?,"Just purchased this one, I found it accidentally while searching for another album, and I had to have it. This is a compilation of Funky Jazz tunes from the 70's. Much of it sounds similar to music from shaft or Starsky & Hutch, and it is truly awesome. My favorite is Track 9 Azymuth/Dear Limmertz ...very funky indeed. I would recommend any fan of funk to buy this album and the other 6 albums in the Pulp Fusion collection."
2,Old articles,"I bought this book hoping to get some conventional instructioninto building a model airplane. I am a building clutz, and can use all the help I can get. What is inside is a collection of old magazine articles, telling how to build parts out of paper, some useful info about some construction, but nothing that I cant read on the internet for free, a wasted $19.95."
3,Didn't do much for me,"I have curly hair (chemically treated) and I noticed absolutely no difference using this. What's it supposed to do exactly? I've used protein treatments before (the Babyface Protein) and it was really nice. This Aphogee though, just didn't seem to make much difference in the way my hair felt at all. I wanted it too, because the spray-on application is very convenient. Oh well. Maybe just not the right product for me."
2,Meh,"I purchased this product because it was suggested to me. Unfortunately, I saw absolutely no difference in the condition of my relaxed hair after using it. I actually gave it away after two uses to my friend. I'm not sure if she finished the bottle but I know that she wasn't compelled to buy another. If you can try it for free, go for it. I just found that it wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
2,Not the best Aphogee Product,"I love Aphogee. I hate this product. I'm black and I have soft hair that has really deep waves. It doesn't like to stay straight and even with relaxers it reverts. It takes forever to dry and frizzes with the first sign of moisture. Clearly that means I blow dry and flat iron a lot which means heat damage, and since I use Aphogee treatments and conditioner I tried this. It makes my hair sticky, dull looking, and fluffy no matter how much I use. Once it's in no amount of oil sheen, hair grease or cream will give it shine,and it stays sticky until I wash it out. I am now looking for another product."
5,GREAT STUF!!!!,"Okay, I always use this stuff right before I blow dry/flat iron my hair and within a minute or so it strengthens my hair enough that I can comb through it while blow drying. I love it, and it smells great. Im going to have to buy another bottle soon, but really you don't need to be soaking your damp hair in this stuff. Just section your hair into 4-5 and spritz each section once or twice. Then gently massage it into your hair, and you're good to go.LOVE THIS STUFF!"
3,Revitalizer,"I was used to using a Wella Restructurizer which has been discontinued. This is the closest product I have found to what I was using. It works ok, but not as well as the Wella. That being said, I'd order it again unless I find another product that works better"
2,just Colored water,This is just like colored water on my hair does nothing to help my hair I still shed when I used this but try Redken anti snap I find that much better but its a bit drying but you have to know how to use it but it definitely works unlike this.
2,Greasy,"I used this a few times and my hair looked really dirty and greasy afterwards. I wash my hair every other day, and if I use this, the following day my hair looks so greasy that I have to wash my hair a day early. Perhaps my hair is just too fine. I prefer the Bumble and Bumble thickening spray; it also has the hydrolized protein in it as well."
1,wish i hadn't wasted money on it,"when i brought this i was originally looking for something to spay in my hair every day but i decided to get this instead it really doesn't do anything for my hair and yes i followed the directions and applied heat to my hair after i washed it but i could live without it. i really dont see what it's doing and i've tried it a couple of times...so yeah, but the chi keratin mist does wonders for my hair i love that product but this i wish i could return it but i already used it"
2,what is this?,"i dont even know what this does, i bought it hoping it would help keep my hair healthy and cut down on the dryness, over all, it didnt do much for me, invest in something better,although my hair style is curly african american hair"
2,Average,"I got this to help with my split ends because I blow dry daily. I am a blonde with fine hair, perhaps its not made for me, but I didnt think it was all that great."
4,No more breakage,"I am in love with Aphogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer. It has made all the difference in strengthening my hair and stopping breakage. I am of African American descent and a alot of the times I felt nervous about doing my own hair and would only make trips to the salon. With this product I don't see hairs coming out in the comb, they actually stay on my head now. My hair needed the protein that this product offers and gives me the confidence to blow dry and style without any worries. Try it, you might make it a staple of yours like I did."
4,A sci-fi version of A Christmas Carol,"This novel reminds me a great deal of A Christmas Carol, much more so than Flowers for Algernon. Professor Marlowe is clearly a Scrooge character, since he gets the chance to revisit his past and discover that his legacy isn't nearly as golden as he thought. The comparisons to Flowers for Algernon are less pronounced, although both are about brain experiments that don't turn out quite as expected. And I agree it's more of a fable than science fiction, but that's not a bad thing. It's also well-written and held my interest, with a very touching ending. I can see where this would appeal greatly to the young adult crowd, although I enjoyed it too."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because it was recommended to me based on other books that I had bought from Amazon (Time Traveller's Wife, Life of Pi, to name a few). I was sorely disappointed with it. The writing was childish and the plotline far from interesting. I would recommend it for teenagers maybe...."
2,"Hmmm, not necessarily as great as everyone's saying...","I liked it, the characters were fun - but it was a bit redundant. I didn't see any big twists, just different ways of pondering the same basic questions. An easy read, a neat concept, a little boring."
2,Predictable and simple,"If a multi-layered plot with an unforeseen ending is for you, this book will sorely disappoint. The storyline was predictable and too simplistic -- a doctor goes beyond ethical bounds and the subjects suffer. This concept is interesting but the book isn't. The novel might be more appropriate for young or teen readers."
3,Easy read but predictable.,"Smart, well written, but disappointing. I expected alot more. Why was there so little science in the book?"
4,Intelligent; makes you think,"I really enjoyed this book. It raises some interesting questions about human experimentation that have no simple answers. Someone else here compared it to A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, which is the same book I thought of. (I read the reader reviews after reading the book.) It's short but addresses some important issues about the value of human life, and about who might benefit from all the future medical breakthroughs and who might not. If you like science fiction that's more than just a shoot-em-up with ray guns, the type that makes you stop and think, you'll like this book a lot."
4,Really good,"Really liked this novel. Enjoyed the characters, especially the professor who reminded me of someone I once knew and the story itself was very interesting and well written. Read it in two days. Can't say I pondered the story afterwards but I definitely recommend it."
2,Would have been okay as a short story,"The only reason I'm bothering to review this book is so others like me won't be fooled by the 5 star rating into thinking this is some masterpiece of literature. It's a pretty cool story, but only deserves to be maybe 50 pages, not 170. There is just endless tedious dialogue that bored me so badly that I skimmed over the last 40 pages in about 15 minutes just to find out the ending. The characters don't seem real at all; their dialogue is incredibly ""on the nose"". Most of the scenes had either no suspenseful buildup or no interesting climax. The core idea and the ending were okay, which is why I give 2 stars instead of 1."
4,Elements of a mystery,"For what it's worth, An Audience for Einstein isn't just a science fiction tale. I prefer mysteries, and was pleased to find some familiar mystery elements here. (I'm surprised no one has mentioned that.) There's some detective work, and a good part of the book operates as a ""whodunnit"" as the doctor struggles to keep the experiment a secret from everyone. For that, I'm giving the book 4 stars. As others have said (better than me) it's a fun read."
2,"Interesting idea, very poorly executed....","I had high hopes for this book, but unfortunately, was extremely disappointed. Two things really lept out at me. First, one of the major characters is a child, however, like many authors, Mr. Wakely has trouble writing a child. His child is really more of a short adult, rather than a child. He talks like an adult, and mostly reacts like an adult. Kids are hard to write, but this isn't one. Secondly, the ""mind transplant"", or whatever it's called, doesn't behave in a believable manner on the child. Instead of merging in and gradually taking over the child, it's pretty much binary. The kid goes back and forth between being the old professor in a short body, or being the kid. No blurring of the personalities, no merging of memories, nothing that would really make this an interesting tale of one mind taking over, simply a binary exchange of the two."
4,Loved this book!,"I had bought this book with The Time Traveler's Wife months ago, and only now finished it.This is a really good book.It has characters I really cared about, and makes some important statements about equality and human worth without lecturing readers.That plus it has a great ending I never saw coming, although clues were there. Very emotional.It's more of a modern fable than science fiction, which I wasn't expecting.I would recommend it to anyone who likes novels that explores controversial issues in a pleasant rather than confrontational way."
5,Great Mute,"This is my first mute and I am very glad I selected the Denis Wick. It has a very nice sound, and keeps my practice times quieter at the same time."
5,"A lovely, gently humorous story","Patsy, 8, and Jim, 6, befriend Miss Slade, a neighbor woman who lives in squalor with her six dogs, six cats, donkey, goats and chickens. This is a lovely, gently humorous story with delightful characters, both human and animal. Readers will rejoice when Miss Slade, helped by the kindness of the children and their parents, decides to ""turn over a new leaf"" on her 70th birthday. The book is generously and charmingly illustrated, too."
4,Hard to Put Down,"This was a great book, and I couldn't put it down. It is a quick read, if you love mysteries. I was throughly in to it, and I really enjoyed it."
3,"Good workout, but strange model","The workout itself was pretty good, although a little short on chest exercises. But the model on the left was extremely distracting with her weird facial expressions. She alternately winced and flashed this fake smile between huffing and puffing and didn't seem at all comfortable or to be enjoying the workout. A little surprising on a Gin Miller production."
4,Thought-provoking,"Second-Story Man takes the relationship of a 'single father and daughter' in a heartfelt direction, juxtaposing the otherwise dark, cold, creepy storytelling of Arthur, Max, and Janet. The production design works well with the overall themes presented, as Dhand gets the most out of his actors in this independent thriller."
5,exciting thriller,"A thought-provoking and interesting film. ""Second Story Man"" explores revenge and its toll on those who seek it. Beautifully written and filmed with a hauntingly beautiful score."
2,Fair,For some reason the interior artwork was inferior to The clue of The Hissing Serpent - this volumes' successor. Shattered Helmut I found a fairly decent read. A lot of interaction with the criminals. I particulary liked the character Kitten Cole who was regretably caught early on page 136. The brothers travel to Greece (Don't care for that part). I compare all volumes with one another and like 90% of the higher volumes they are drastically inferior to the lower volumes. Call a spade a spade and do not give every book a 5 star rating. This book was ok - but worthy of nothing higher than a 2. RATED C
2,A Bit Dull,"Frank and Joe help their pen pal Evan Pandropolos located an ancient helmet lost by Evan's uncle on a trip to the U.S. many years ago. Personally, I didn't care much for this book. It certainly isn't one of the worst of the series, but it could have been much better. I didn't find that the book was written particularly well and it could have used more action. I found the book disappointing for a number of reasons. For one, the most important clue to locating the helmet was given to the Hardys; instead of being something that they figure out for themselves. As well, while Frank, Joe and Evan are harassed by a couple of the crooks throughout much of the book, they hardly ever actually come into contact with them until the end of the book. The only one of the Hardy's friend to appear in the book is Chet and he is only in the beginning and the end. I can't say that I hated this book, but it did little to really keep me interested."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad book, this one. Rank it average among the series. I never liked the fact that I think after volume #37, the Sleuth was never mentioned or mentioned only rarely and that the Hardys never stayed in Bayport. The writers used other setting to eat up pages of writing, so instead of reading a mystery we were given a geaography lesson. For these reasons I drop the Shattered Helmet a couple notches, but it was good enough to warrant a 3 star rating."
4,Joey Hill is a treasure,"She is one of the best writers in erotica today, especially in the difficult field of BSDM. She has complex characters and wrenching romances coupled with explicit sex. She is also one of the very few who can have male subs and female doms and still have a love story that most women can relate to. I love her books.This one, set in a mythical island where only 3 people seem to live (and an elephant!) is not her best, but her weaker books are better than most. I bought it to complete my collection (that's the sort of fan I've become) and am happy to have it on my keeper shelf, but have reread Natural Law more often. If you can only buy one, buy Natural Law, but if you want them all, this more than satisfies..."
4,Evocative and vivid,"While I'm a huge fan of the author's vivid prose, I didn't get as emotionally involved in this story as I did viscerally. I normally have little problems with the fact the author is a headhopper, but for some reason, it got in the way for me with this. However, this author's worst is still better than most authors' best, and the sheer glorious eroticism of her prose makes the book more than worth it."
5,hot!,"The description says over 250 pages. It didn't seem that long, reading it went so fast.This is another great book written by Joey Hill.The development of the characters, the description of the scenes, the struggle to take control or to submit--terrific."
1,Didn't like it,"I did not like the book at all. It was so cheap and lame in writing. The author could have done some reading relevant to the context of what he/she wrote, before finalizing such a book."
5,Great book,"Another great book from Joey Hill. Very tantilizing. I have gone on to read the whole series. Not for the meek but if you want some spice, this is it."
5,Every Scintist Should Read This,"This is a fascinating read showing how pervasive fraud is in modern day science. The book was written 3 decades ago but I suspect that the ground rules of science have not changed significantly since that time. The accounts of the various fraudsters are vivid and would be hard to believe had we not just seen this kind of behavior in our financial markets. Even icons like Newton and Galileo were caught cooking the books. A ""must read"" for every research scientist."
5,Terrific book.,This book is a real eye opener. Its a must read. I recommend it to anyone trying to understand how the scientific community works.
4,Sand,"I have this mare and she is my first Breyer Classic. Once I got her home, I introduced her to my Grand Champion mare, Juliet. They make a lovely pair.I call her ""Sand"" with her pedigree name ""Sandpaper Sand."" I call her Sand because she is kinda the color of damp or dry sand.And I know Sand is a mare because if you look, I mean really look, into her eyes, you can see Sand is a mare.By the way, I am only calling her Sand in my review because that is her name that I call her. And I have a list of other good names:Sand,Julie,(Jewelie,)Sandie,Sapphire,Starlight.These are names I would recomend for her. Oh, and I almost forgot, BE SUPER DUPER CAREFUL. She broke three legs while living with me. So... BE SUPER DUPER CAREFUL WITH HER! AND I MEAN CAREFUL! I gave her 4 stars because she's easy to break and she's not the best mold Breyer can make.Thanks for reading my...ahem...long review!"
2,Scary...but...not.,"This Game is definitely not a game that i would recommend. The graphics are horrible and its completely outdated. The achievements are impossible, and the game itself is just terrible. Save your money, don't buy it. But if you really want to get the achievements, than buy the game for like 3 or 5 bucks. Good luck."
4,video games,My son enjoys playing this game and he shares it with his friends who come over and visits. He brags about how his mom order his items for xbox 360 at a low price. Now his friends parents wants to know how they can save on items as well. Thanks for having a company who knows parents are on a fixed budget.
2,Really... too good to be true,"This game is a big""could have been"" and turned to be a great piece of... boring ""action"" (if I may use that word). I'm a huge fan of Clive Barkers' work, his books, stories (like the one in the game) are amazing, wonderful. But, even with a great story, the game is really poor. The gameplay is boring, with no challenge and no excitement. You don't get scared, you don't feel any adrenaline , the display of some actions is really bad, the controls are complicated.You should buy this game if you're gonna be patient and do it ONLY for the story."
1,Bought for $4 and regret it.,"This game is so terrible my friends and I have been giving each other this game for birthdays and such as a joke. I cannot stress enough how bad it is. You can't die in it, your team will do everything for you and its basically a long movie with bad graphics."
5,A Must Own Game!,"Jericho doesn't have the extensive playability as some of the big titles out today do, but it is definitely one game that I'm glad I didn't miss out on! Jericho's dark and twisted atmosphere keeps you wondering what mutated form will be lurking around the next corner, while each character's unique set of weapons and magical skills keeps your mind running to figure out which combination of force to use to survive each horrifying encounter. Grab this game as soon as you can, and enjoy! :)"
4,Underrated game,"I was kind of reluctant to pick this game after reading some review about it, but when I saw that amazon had it for less than $10 I said: COUNT ME IN!After beating the game I must say that this is one of the most underrated games ever. The graphics are moody and among the sickest I've seen. There is blood splattered everywhere and the color palette is not limited (as some have mentioned), it is actually part of the overall experience and definitely adds up to the moodiness.Gameplay is simple yet very satisfying, you have your squad and jump from member to member in order to kill gruesome beasts. The story is good but is even better for those who appreciate the occult: there are many hidden things between the lines and the xtra touch of sumerian myths left me with a great impression.Perfect game? Not a chance but it is one that has been discredited and once you play it it will be clear that this should be a sleeper hit, not the atrocity some reviewer want to make you think it is."
5,THE HORNS OF JERICHO THE HORNS OF JERICHO!!,"When I got this game I didn't realy know what to expect most of the reviews were mixed and seemed to be writen by either hardcore Halo 3 fans or BIG Clive Barker fans of which I am niether, but the game looked really cool and sounded pretty original not to mention it was dirt cheap. I am really suprised with how good this game is, it looks great and plays even better. The story is very cool and original if not hard to follow at times but it's cool. It is a little short but at least it does have replay value. I would rate this game among the top 10 best FPS's of late don't miss it."
4,One of the best supernatural shooters to come to the 360!,"Sure, I looked both at the Negative and Positive reviews for this game. I was interested in this game since I first looked at it at a Hollywood Video. I saw more positive reviews for the game, so I bought it cheap on Amazon.com. After beating the game, I took sides with the positive reviewers."
5,simplemente Genial,"Realmente Clive Baker la pegó de nuevo con este juego, quien no recuerda Undying? pues Jericho es un juego con un ambiente realmente bueno y una trama que te mantiene a la espectativa zona tras zona, un guion muy bueno, musica y ambiente grafico que te mantienen full adrenalina.EL modo de juego de usar cualqueir de los personajes del equipo permite hacerte la partida ma sinteresante o menos dificil todo depende de quien usar y en que momento.El unico detall quizas es que me esperaba un video final mas impactante pero por eso no deja de ser bueno.Recomendado 100%"
4,Hope your not the squeamish type.,"I honestly can say Jericho was really interesting horror game with a great storyline and it's not your typical horror game at all it was dark, gritty, great voice acting and very disturbing hellish enemies that will remine in your memories any way the master mind behind this is Clive Barker the creator of Hellriser and let me tell ya his very disturbed but this game will keep you on the edge of your seat for along you will discover extremly dark corridors with hellish surroundings and sounds that will make you not want to look back. there is a few minor complaints one thing that annoyed me was when you crouch behind cover some how the enemies could still get you but other than that if your looking for a good horror game look into this."
4,"For the price, it was fun.","I got this dirt cheap used. For what I paid, I'm happy. I won it in just over a week. It's a first-person shooter as you work your way through various levels. Graphics were great - nicely detailed and control was fine. The thing about this game is you get to jump from person to person in your team, each of which has seperate weapons or powers. And they're all surprisingly fun to play. I thought I'd ignore some of them - and maybe 1 or 2 I thought were weak, but the others were a lot of fun to play. It's got this horror-theme going on, which was all right. Graphics were nice but had that monochromatic thing going on - you know, when they need to save on processing power? But still it looked good and I liked it. I thought the ending was utterly dumb. And the plot was weak - basically you're out to kill this unkillable thing. I think. Who cares - just give me the guns and point me in the right direction!!!"
2,jericho/just a filler game,"just something to kill time, buy cheap, then its ok to play, otherwise i wont waste time, played for about an hour and gave up"
1,bad choice to buy from these people EMax Games,i didnt get the right game i got a pc game instead of a xbox 360 version....they told me they were out of stock and the pc game would work with my xbox 360 and i called microsoft and they said the pc verison would not work with the xbox 360....so dont buy from Emax Games there a bad choice and rip you off...so if you want this game for xbox 360 get it from gamestop and this game is really good to play wish i had the right version from Emax Games but they ripped me off so i went to gamestop and got the game....
2,Great Author Horrible concept for a game.,"I got both the bootleg and the real copy of the demo for this game and they both suck ass...the control's are to hard to figure out so Mr. Barker will have to have a talk with mister gate's if there is going to be a part 2, too this installment...."
1,codemasters should be called cash masters,"This is the first game I've purchased that the creators of the game then try to charge you for game codes by calling a 900 number at a rate of $2.99/minute. If you pay retail price for the game, you should receive the benefits of owning the game, not pay extra money so you can get full play. I didn't pay but I did go to the creators website to register the game because they offered one more game code there. Guess what, the web site is no more, you are taken to their facebook page. Tried Googling them to see if they had changed their web address but any return I received from Google took me to the facebook page. The link for their website on facebook took me to their facebook page. Go figure that one out. I thought game play sucked for the most part. Hang on to your money. This game might be cheap now but it should have been priced cheap when first released."
1,waste of time,"the story is realy bad!!! the playable is not good, the graphics are ordinary. dont buy this game. you will regrate if you do it!!!"
2,Si no fuera por las Imagenes,"Este es un juego solo para fans de Clive Barker,honestamente al juego le falta mucho, lo rescatable son las imagenes, y los demonios sacados de la mente de este escritor tan famoso."
5,Mas de Silvio,"Una de sus mas bellas composiciones es el primer titulo,este cd como la mayoria de sus producciones lleva el sello inigualable del Trovista Cubano;para quienes disfrutan el estilo de Silvio esta no puede faltar en vuestra coleccion."
2,"Like the season, this video is over too soon","People who enjoyed the 2000 Titans Team video will be disappointed in the latest one. This year's edition runs only 23 minutes, and doesnt have the player interviews that the last edition did. Several games are skipped over completely, and generally it takes a cursory look at the season without really providing any insight. Granted, we didnt have a playoff run or a Super Bowl to highlight this year, but I hardly think this short video is worth the price."
3,Pedometer,I really like this product. It's easy to use - one button to push and you are set. The only thing that would make this product better would be a cover. I am continually bumping the reset button thus erasing what I've accomplished.
4,Just what I wanted,This was just what I wanted. It is simple and accurate. I had a cheap pedometer before from a giveaway program and it just wasn't working well. This has filled my requirements.
2,Pedometer,It isn't accurate. Sometimes it jumps up 6 steps with 1 step. If you move to fast it will jump up steps on you. Just bending over adds steps on it. I would not recommend it.
1,Cheap piece of junk - never worked,I guess you get what you pay for because this was just a piece of junk and never worked. Save yourself the hassle and buy something else.
2,Not what I expected...,"I would not have bought this product had I realized how cheezy it would look. I was expecting a regular frame, not one with four sides that you slide over. I was trying to shop quickly and buy online, next time I will just go to the store to find something like this. I would not recommend this if you are trying to frame something and make it look nice."
2,Not what I expected,The book I ordered was super cheap- but there was a reason. The information provided was a really poor description and I got a 1st Edition. Lesson learning- don't buy unless you are sure it's what you need.
3,"Not clear that product was ""low cost edition""","I received the book I ordered; however, I received the ""low cost"" edition which basically means the paper is thinner making it more difficult to read because the print from the other side shows through. This was not clear in the description."
1,Out of date. Great during the seventies!,"This book is long out of date. Read either Kotter, Beitler, or Schein."
1,This book is out of date!,"This book was written in the seventies! It shows. I recommend reading something current; such as Cummings & Worley, or Beitler, or Kotter."
3,"Nice for the Money, but....","These frames are good quality for the money, but the downside is the shipping cost. I would recommend that the seller find a way to combine shipping. I bought 5 of them and paid over $40 for standard shipping. Considering the size and weight, that is ridiculous."
2,"Cheap looking, poor construction","I thought this was an MCS format frame with a single black plastic border, but it's a cardboard backing, clear plastic front, and then four black plastic strips that you slip on to the sides. The side pieces are flimsy and they're not cut quite right so you can't get them to meet up at the corners. It holds the poster, and it looks ok from 5 feet away, but it's honestly pretty disappointing."
3,Serves my purpose.,"It's a piece of plastic with a piece of cardboard behind it. Those two piece are held together on the edges by the for pieces that form the frame. The four side/ frame pieces do not fit together perfectly, but they do well enough. It serves its purpose and doesn't cost too much. I am happy to use it for now."
2,You get what you pay for,These are thin and flimsy and would not put a poster in them. I did put a certificate in this I needed preserved and it worked for what I needed it for. It is not special or flashy or sturdy.I would not purchase it again but now that I have it it works.You get what you pay for.
3,Cheap frames.. but.,"The size 12 x 18 is pretty hard to find for under $40. So I thought I would try these. The price was right and the shipping was only $7. What you get is a piece of cardboard backing. Thin plastic edging that removes on all four sides and a flimsy film of plastic. These are very cheap budget frames, but do you know what? They will work for the pictures I want to put in my gameroom. I think they look too cheap to use in your living room."
4,great quality for the price!,"The product was great, especially for the price I paid. I would buy it again."
3,ok.....i guess,"this movie has to be one of the [worst] skate movies i have ever seen, but ive noticed when you dont skate you seem to hate watching it but if you skate you love to watch it. in my opinion i think people who dont skate will love it but i thought it was ok....i guess."
1,Just a bad skate video,"This skate video was probably the worst skate video that I've ever seen. They claimed it took them 5 years to make this video. 5 YEARS??? Is that how long it took them to hide there pride and integrity just being associated with this piece of work? I'm giving this video a 1 star only because they won't allow me to give this video a zero star rating. The skate video was about 45 minutes long but there was only about 5 minutes of actual skating. Most of the tricks were old and repetitive. The lamest part of the video was the dumb T&A and the lets burn everything and run over everything with the van shtick. Tony Hawk does make a guest appearance. As a fan of Tony hawk for many years, I hope Tony Hawk never adds this video to his resume."
3,?,"not too sure about this one. The skating (is bad), the story line is bad, but rest is great. Don't get this see see skating but to see some van smashing and the guy from chips."
1,This movie really (stinks),"Don't waste ur money, its a horrible movie, unfortunetly, i did, not much great skating, first time u see it though its funny, but later its horrible, don't buy"
1,Terrible - CKY wanna be,"If you want a skateboarding video DON'T get this. Luckilly, I got this with ""The End"", which is an awsome video. This is exactly like cky only completely staged, fake, and unfunny. Get CKY if you want original humor. If you really have to see this crap, dont pay more than $2.00 cause it sux."
4,Jeremy Klein and Heath Kirchart...what more do you want?,"At first I hated this video, but after a long hiatus I watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was having a Jackass marathon and this fit in perfectly (along with the Big Brother videos and cky videos). Anywho...yeah there's not much skateboarding but it has Jeremy Klein and Heath wrecking havoc in a van...and Mark Gonzales makes an appearnce. The music for the tour footage is by Cher and surprisingly it fits well. You also got Willy going potty behind some bushes which was funny. Jeremy Klein dressed as a dorky rollerblader annoying Dan Rogers was great. The little skating in it was good along with good music. If you like Jackass, I recommed this, if you want to see amazing skateboarding skip this and get p.j. ladd's wonderful horrible life and tiltmode army's man down."
4,A Colorful Journey,A young woman who has lost her sight rides the subway to places only visible in her imagination. The pages are filled with vivid sensory details describing the way she remembers and perceives and imagines the world around her.The stunning illustrations and the main's character's colorful journey provide a sharp contrast to the dark reality of her world.An imaginative story that will leave readers with much to think about.
2,"Exquisitely beautiful illustrations, but...","Yes, the illustrations are breathtaking, but the writing? A childrens' picture book needs more than great pictures or great text. It must have both, and they need to match and enhance each other. Jimmy Lao's text reads like it was an afterthought. ""Oh, yes! I've got all these lovely pictures. Now I need to write something"". And for what age group is the book aimed? Very young children will love the pictures but will be bored by the words. Older children will also love the pictures, but will find the text ""preachy"". This book would almost be better without the words. At least then it would allow the reader to make up their own inner dialogue about what it is the blind girl is ""seeing"". I can only suppose that the book lost something in the translation from Chinese to English. Either that, or the publishers felt that the pictures were strong enough to overshadow the overly sentimental writing."
1,Don't catch this Rainbow,"I'ts rare that I submit a review, but I felt I must express my disappointment in this overpriced DVD, there was only 20-30 seconds of live concert footage from just a select handfull of Dio era Rainbow songs (this DVD was not done with band approval) basiclly it's a bunch of overly zealous fans giving their opinions on how great a guitarist Ritchie Blackmore is, in the end, I neither saw or learned anything new from this DVD that I didn't already know.I can only wish that someday the complete Rainbow 1977 concert will be released on DVD."
1,A major disappointment,"Just adding to the two reviews already here, this DVD (and it's companions from this outfit) are little more than commentary by several (to me, at least) unknown British musicians from a band called ""Autumn Wind"" who wax eloquent about how great and underappreciated RB and Rainbow is/was/will be, interspersed with maybe 20 to 30-second concert clips in between.I fell for this scam and bought BOTH Rainbow DVDs. A total waste of money."
1,"Insulting, waste of time and money","Wow...other reviewers already covered it, but I gotta say...DO NOT buy this DVD if you are expecting any sort of decent Rainbow footage...you'll get a very brief clip (generally an intro, or bit of a solo) then it cuts away to some no-name British wanker telling you how great Ritchie is, then some lousy session musician will tell you how he would make a certain solo better, and so on. Some comments from actual, legit musicians (Neil Murray and Dougie White) are nice, but the latter pretty much plays the company man and thinks everything is just perfect. I can only assume this was made to rob people of their money, as it doesn't at all deliver what the packaging states, and seems like something some friends put together so that one day Ritchie might talk to them. Skip it."
1,Don't waste your money!,I have never been as disappointed with a purchase as I am with this one. The results are a blurry unrecognizable blob of a poor excuse of a picture. My first toy Intel webcam that I bought 6 years ago seems like a Nikon 5700 compared to this thing. Shame on the manufacturer that has the audacity to sell this product as a legitimate camera at any price!
2,Waldman Atlas of Interventional Pan Management,The book is great however the half of the index is missing. I returned it to Amazon and they shipped another book with the same exact problem. One would think they would check this since I explained the problem in detail when I called for the return. What to do now? I use the book daily do I risk returning it againg for the same problems since it must of happened during printing since the books I received were still wrapped in plastic.
2,Not his Best Work,"I had thought that this was going to be a day to day calander (its not). Besides that it seems like Mr. Larson has lost his touch with humor, I wont purchase another one next year."
4,From Cache to Coffee Table,"Margot Anne Kelley reminds us of exactly why we started playing this game in the first place! It's not about the treasures you find in the boxes, it's about the treasures in the world around us. The pictures are beautiful and the stories really draw you to the locations. As an added bonus there's that great sense of camaraderie that we get through the shared experience of geocaching.This is a great book for cachers (especially those dealing with cabin fever) and also a great way to introduce your non-geocaching friends to exactly what we see in this game."
4,Coffee table grabber,This book is just what you need to capture the interest of possible cachers. Nothing peeks the interest better than great photos of interesting places and having the added pleasure of finding a hidden treasure. I received this book as a gift and have thumbed through it many times.Local Treasures: Geocaching across America is one of the things I make sure is out when company comes to visit.
5,12.99 at your local Costco!!!!!,"Very Awesome. I-Robot is insane. Stupidly worth 13 bucks for 3 blu-rays! I have checked around online and brick and mortar and you can't touch this deal, not even close. But we all know Costco rules. Come see MR. T. in Heaven on Earth, Prescott, AZ.....:)"
5,Impressive HD quality!!,If only they have more box sets like these. These variety sets are really entertaining and I like them very much.
4,"Very good overview, but not the best","This is a comprehensive guidebook for all the Hawaiian islands. It covers a lot of history and a lot of the sites. It also provides some basic information about hotels and restaurants. The pictures are somewhat lacking, but the text provides excellent descriptions. If you need one guidebook, this may be it, but it leaves out some stuff that is worth seeing or doing."
3,an ok guidebook.,"THe rough guide hawaii is an ok guidebook, it does leave out some sights and things, but what i don't particularly like about it, is how critical the author is. he is very opinionated, he seems not to like lu'aus or the bigger resorts, and alot of the more popular landmarks he thinks arent worth visiting. although the book does have alot of information, i don't really like the ""criticalness"" of the author. having been to hawaii 6 times, The best guides for hawaii i can reccomend, are wizard publication's ""big island/maui/kauai revealed"" guidebooks, as they are written by people whom actually live in hawaii."
4,The elusive Max Allen Collins...,"I like Collins... I really do. Personally, his Nathan Heller series are interesting, accurate and a fast-read. I've even enjoyed his other historical fiction (Murder at the War of the World's was outstanding).Anyone who has read his Purgatory series knows that Collins is really a good writer, but I guess I don't understand why he cheapens his work by copying televeision series like CSI and now Criminal Minds. Of course the obvious answer is because he can make money with a recognizable series, but he is a much more talented author than this.Collins is a devoted Mickey Spillane, 50's noir, author who occassionally writes under another name or with his wife. Recently he tackled the son of Doc Holiday meeting Wyatt Earp and Al Capone... imagine that!! I always look forward to reading him, but I wish he would, however, had stayed with Heller and continued to expand his world.Collins is good historical mystery read regardless of what he tackles."
3,A BIT TOO CARNAL,Another story by Collins who is an excellent crime writer. Heller fails to bring the murderer to justice yet justice is done. A bit over the top in some places but an enjoyable read.
5,Well Done,"As always, a great connection with history. The story of this unsolved murder continues to interest those who know it's details. Excellent read."
2,Not Particularly Funny,"This Mr Bean tape does contain some good ideas, and the sketches are maybe even well-written and well-structured... but in fact, they are not that funny! Basicly a waste of money."
3,Not for all iMac G5s,You need to know that if you have a first generation iMac G5 that this will NOT FIT in your computer. I had to return it to J&R Music World and wait a month for them to get the right version (which isn't carried here on Amazon) in stock.
5,best of Shepard Vol. II,"This collection contains 8 of Pulitzer-prizewinning Sam Shepard's best plays. Shepard has a way of capturing our imagination with a wild collection of characters in even wilder stories. ""Fool For Love"", ""Angel City"", ""Geography of a Horse Dreamer"", ""Action"", ""Cowboy Mouth"", Seduced"", ""Suicide in B"", ""Melodrama Play"".Shepard is one of the great American voices in theatre. These are all classics that deserve to be remembered and studied."
5,A discovery !,"I hesitated to put 5 stars because, there is not really an other interpretation to compare to. At the same time, when you listen to it, it is so .. unconventional that it would be difficult to compare.These pieces, along the Ligeti etudes by Aimard, and the 5th Quatuor (by Arditti) have been a recent, eyes opening discovery.2 Months ago, I barely knew the name of Scelsi, I am not a scholar at all, and I get .. like immerged in this music that I did not even remotely thought 6 months ago I would even try to listen to.In a review of the quatuors by Arditti, a reviewer noted that This is really less traditional music and more of an experience"", It was about the 5th Quatuor. I would say the same for the music here.A discovery of 2006 for me."
4,for train lovers,these are really cool movies. My kids will sit for hours watching them. If you like trains you should enjoy these.
1,Too much talking,"I was disappointed in this train series. I purchased it for my grandson, who loves train visuals. This is a narrative format, which bores him."
5,"If you miss Tesla, buy this CD now!","It's not Tesla, but Jeff Keith and Tommy Skeoch captured the Tesla sound perfectly. Most of these songs could be right off any of the old Tesla albums. There's not a weak song on the album, I keep trying to pick my favorites and it always seems I come back to ""Lady Bug"" and ""She Don't"" over and over again. Buy this CD and I promise you won't be disappointed...if Tesla had done this in 1990, it would have sold five million albums. It's that good."
4,Picks up where Tesla left off,"If you liked the greatness of Tesla, you will enjoy Bar 7. Think of Tesla with a more modern feel and vibe to it. It has Jeff Keith(former lead singer of Tesla)on vocals and did have Tommy Skeoch on guitars(also from Tesla). I just read that Taommy is not in the band right now and the other former guitarist from Tesla, Frank Hannon, is in. My favorites are the catchy chorus of '4 Leaf Clover"", the rockin' ""No Show"" and the mellow ""Love is Such""."
3,"Yes, it sounds like Tesla, and that is good...","For all of us waiting for the Tesla live ""RePlugged"" CD next month, this is a pretty nice stopgap. But honestly, Jeff Keith and Tommy Skeoch do NOT have a ""new sound."" (Let's not kid ourselves.) Is it Tesla? Well, no. but is it veeeeery close? Yes. Jeff was in on all the songwriting, and Tommy was in on most of it. This is a reasonably strong album from a band that will be largely forgotten in ten years. I finally got it yesterday at the local used CD store [...], and I wish I'd picked it up earlier, because it would have given me the ""new Tesla songs"" fix I've been missing since ""Steppin' Over."" Short review? If you're a big-time Tesla fan, you'll dig ""The World Is A Freak."""
3,........Well.....,"I thought this recording was a little bit of a disappointment. It was too easy going I guess for me. Jeff Keith is my favorite rock singer although I think of him with Tesla and that's it. The song writing really reflected the divorce that he was going through at the time: sad and slow. Although, I can see where some would really love it because it is a new sound."
1,Shocker,I thought it would be a good book but it turned out really sad. I would have to say I hated it. I read it because I had to for school. If you really get into a book and like to know how everything ends this is not a book for you.
1,"Great, if the plugs fit!!","I have 3 bottles I want converted into lamps. One wine bottle and two decorative bottles. Unfortunately the adapters are either too small and fall INTO the bottles, or far too big. It would be great if I could use it for it's intended purpose."
1,Useless for eminent domain or condemnation-too personal,"I was so disappointed with this book. I hoped to gain some useful knowledge about eminent domain, as my home is in jeopardy. Instead, I found a very personal tale, filled with with onformation about the biths of his three children and the most outlandish condemnation cases. In one, he told about cockroaches crawling all over the property owner. In 2 more he told tales of human waste being discovered on the premises. In the rest he mostly told how having a beer or a chaw of chewing tobacco with the property owners changed the previously hostile people to those who accepted his first offer for the property. Though the tales of spiderwebs hanging over beds, and cockroaches, and human waste and other tales of the filthiest properties he accquired seems to be the gist. Only for other right of way men."
5,Just Wonderful,"I found the Kelp Powder just wonderful. I am hypothyroid and so I take kelp tablets daily as a supplement but having the powder is really so so wonderful. I mix it in with my morning juice, or add it to my first cup of green tea or I even add it to my morning oats or smoothie. I have added it to my soup and I intend to keep adding it to whatever I decide to drink as even the green colour does look very greennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn in these days of us all wanting to be green in all aspects of saving the world."
3,Unexpected taste,"I can feel the stimulating effect it has on my thyroid even though I only use half the recomended dose. The taste is rather fishy, but maybe you wont taste it if you mix it with food. However, it's overall a great product."
1,Not worth the shipping costs,"I wanted to second the review given previously.These are fine frames for 8.99, but they are not worth 18.00!The shipping from Adorama is not justified. Be warned! They charged me 30.00 dollars for shipping when I paid 11 dollars to return ship them back.The frames are fine for inexpensive pieces. They are just not worth the total of both shipping and the price of the frames."
2,Not worth it,"Ben Reed may fill his novel My Dying Breath with realistic jargon and a relatable boot camp experience, but his prose writing is down right terrible, his diologue is poor and his charactors are cliche and as dense as a piece of paper. His main charactors are dull and unrealistic, and way too morally sound and flawless they become boring. Pass on it."
1,open with EXTREME caution,"the reason i hate this reed case is because when i would open it, the reeds would swing out and hit the lid and break. i would buy a reed, then the next day, unpack for band, and would break a brand new reed just by opening a case! would not recommend especially for people who use softer reeds."
2,Where's the entire season???,"Yeah, I guess every Bucs fan should have it just because it is there... know what I mean? They do a very good job covering a few of the games, but they stopped w/ the UNFORGETTABLE game against the Rams @ RJS! Either that or I fell asleep while watching the tape (which is unlikely). What about the last game of the season and the playoff?? Oh well, to tell you the truth, I'm very disappointed regarding *all* the NFL films I have. Come on, how can someone turn a whole season into a 25-minute tape?? Very disappointing... But again, if you want to improve your Buccaneers library, you should buy the tape. At least the material that they have is very good. Another disappointing aspect is that they don't give you the final results of every game or any kind of statistics. Pretty sad..."
4,Nice safe,"Overall,this is a nice,strong safe. Big enough for the essentials. It comes with 2 batteries and 4 machine screws/nuts for drawer mounting but NO wall mounting screws. Be careful of the door if you drawer mount it as it is heavy and swings freely. That's why I recommend wall mounting this safe instead. Mount a cleat(a small strip of wood)horizontally on the wall first and rest the safe on top of it to support the weight while mounting it to the wall. I live in a mobile home so wood screws work fine. I used 2-3/8 wood screws at Wal-Mart by Bulldog Hardware (product# WS-150). This is not required but I put foam tape weatherstip (3/8"" wide x 3/16"" thick) around the door jam just to give it a softer closing."
3,Stack-On PDS-505 Wall Safe,"This Safe is advertised to be either a wall safe or a drawer safe - however, the holes were not prepunched in the sides of the safe for installation in a wall cavityProduction control should check on this"
2,Ok safe - took over a month to recieve!,"While the quality of the safe is good for the price (nothing special) I did not receive the safe for over a month. I was sent a notice it was shipped two days after placing the order, but USPS had no record of the tracking number I received. Customer service agreed it was not a valid tracking number. I then was told two separate times the safe was shipped on different dates. It took many e-mails and phone calls to get this thing delivered!!"
4,Great sci-fi,"Over the past few years I have read many books by John Barnes and have become a great fan of his writing. This story has a dumb name (IMHO, not at all evocative of the story itself) but it is a great story. Lots of engaging action, societal issues, human relationship intricacies, and fascinating characters. If you enjoy this book, read his others, they won't disappoint."
4,One of his best,"I enjoyed this one as much as I disliked Kaleidoscope Century. Teri Mel is a great heroine and her adventures on the Martian surface, even when things get really unpleasant, are captivating. I hope Barnes writes many more of these, though it would probably be a good idea to leave One True and/or Resuna behind. He's got the imagination and skill to go many more places and I'm looking forward to it."
2,Wobbly but functional,"This mirror has a gooseneck adjustment, which is handy for readjustment. However, the upshot is that it wobbles. In addition, because it is horizontal rather than vertical, the wobblyness is exacerbated, and if you change your seating position a bit, you will no longer see what you dialed in in the first place."
2,Falls off every time I go over a bump!,"I bought this mirror today at my local bicycle shop, and will be returning it tomorrow. The piece that inserts into the handlebar is a flimsy piece of plastic, and the insertion is so shallow that just a few minutes of vibration during street riding, plus gravity, were all it took to dislodge the thing and send it to the sidewalk."
3,Major design flaw,"There are some things I really like about the Multi Mirror. The ball joint and pivot tend to stay in place while riding, but can also be easily adjusted if needed. When adjusted almost straight down, I get very little vibration and can see clearly a long way back.But as others have stated, the way it attaches to the bar end is seriously flawed. The expansion system simply does not expand enough for a solid attachment. I lost my first Multi Mirror when it fell off my bike in traffic. Blackburn support was great and quickly sent a replacement - which I modified.I loosened the thumbscrew and got rid of threaded rod. I installed a longer threaded rod and replaced the the inner 'expander cone' with a brass fitting of a slightly larger size and put a nut on the end to hold it. Now when tightened, the brass fitting expands the 4 tabs with much more force.It really should be simple and inexpensive for the folks at Blackburn to improve this aspect and make this a much better product."
5,GREAT MIRROR,"I don't know why other reviewers have had such a hard time installing this. It takes two minutes and your good to go. I love the eliptical shape. It makes it very easy to see what's going on behind you. Unless you are mechanically challendged, buy this mirror, you will love it."
1,Hindsite is 20/20,"This mirror is intalled by forcing the end of the mirror into the end of the bike handles. My bike has handles that are one piece so I have to ""cut"" off the end of the handles before determing if the mirror will work. I don't want to take the chance it won't work then have a damaged grip. So the mirror went into the closet with the Christmas tree stand etc. Sorry to say the postage was 1/3rd of the total cost. The mirror itself seems okay."
4,keys rider,"buying my second mirror in about 8 years. finally broke the first one after many crashes and my sons riding as well.a good mirror, held up well on lots of single track. it fit even with my bar ends. the weak point is the pivot point, made of plastic but it lasted a lot longer than i had anticipated. worth the money."
2,"Functional, but creativity required","I like the mirror and the safety it brings to me while road cycling; however, it requires constant configuration while road cycling. A 20 mile road ride requires 4-5 adjustments, which makes me wonder if I am enjoying my ride or fixated on the mirror. I wrapped tape around the male insert to help lock the mirror in-place to prevent shakes and drift, but it no longer works like you would expect. I'm not sure if anyone else makes one better, but I would try another make and model."
2,Falls off,"Mirror size is goood...buuuuut Mirror is constantly bobbing out of alignment. Unlike a car mirror, you have to reset after going over even smaller bumps. More cheap bike junk.Bad design. A fitting slides into your handlebars. A screw expands the fitting so the mirror *should* stay in.They give you a rubber boot for smaller handle bars. As the rubber wears down, the mirror doesn't stay in. There doesn't appear to be any way to clamp the thing to the handlebars"
1,"Close to Useless (mirror good, mount bad)","This is a nice-looking mirror with a mounting system that just doesn't work. I tried mounting it on my wife's Trek mountain bike using both of the supplied sleeves as well as various improvised alternatives but never succeeded in getting it to remain on the bike for more than a day. As others have indicated, the mounting system is fundamentally flawed. I finally gave up and did what I should have done in the first place: I bought the superb Mountain Mirrcyle mirror. If you want a mirror that stays on the bike, the Mirrcycle is the way to go."
5,Best Mirror I can find!!,I have tried several different mirror types and have decided this mirror is tops for safety optimization via best situational awareness with least forward distraction. Easy solid mount. Durable with unique yoke type pivot. Large field of view. Easy adjustment.
3,"Mirror, Mirror","I've tried several mirrors prior to selecting the Blackburn Multi Mirror. The one downfall that kept creeping up was ""vibration""... from the velcro attached mirrors to the one with clamps and nuts. The Blackburn Multi Mirror when properly mounted and used on the right handlebars will take care of that vibration...just beware that you'll probably want to get two of them. Yes, it's a few more dollars but it's worth it."
1,Bikesickness,"This mirror is really wobbly. I've tightened it and changed the position, but it is so wobbly that I can't use it. It makes me queasy. It also falls off. I would not recommend it. Waste o' money."
1,Don't bother,"This is made from a thin, cheap feeling plastic. We returned ours. Not what we expected."
3,OK But Not Really Heavy Duty,"This product is ok, not costing much can't complain. But while the pneumatic parts have lasted well ... the bracket that screws into the frame has not. It actually broke and while I have been able to make a temp repair probably won't last too long. Probably ok for light use door don't recommend for heavy use. I would put on my back door but not the front (which is where it wore out too quick)/"
4,Pneumatic door closer,When this item finally arrived I found it very easy to install. It only required a small adjustment. I am very pleased with how it works.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"If you are used to quality knives-do NOT buy this set! This knife set is expensive crap! I bought this set thinking I was upgrading from the miss matched ""hand me downs"" that I have. WRONG! Now I have a complete set of knives that im unhappy with. The blades are very thin and flexable. I cant imagine how im going to sharpen these for more than a couple years and still have a blade left? You really do get what you pay for, and I OVERPAID for this junk! For about the same price I could have purchased Chicago Cutlerly, but that set didnt have steak knives with the ""full-tang"" handle design. Turns out, what was delivered to me didn't as well. Be aware of the pics that are shown, I thought I was getting knives with a handle design that I like, but ended up with something else."
5,nice set,very well built and very sharp. gave them as a gift to my mom and she was impressed with the sharpness. nice little perk being able to move the small block with steak knifes out. overall the set is well made and has knives for all the normal daily cooking needs.
1,Very disappointed,"We received this set less than two years ago, and it is literally falling apart. Three of the blades have broken off of the handles in the last few weeks. We have properly cared for the knives, including hand-washing them and using them only for ordinary purposes."
3,Good primer,"This is a good primer. I got this to go with the Battle series on the Russo-Japanese war. Its funny how little things would change for these to armies over the next 40 years. I recommend if you are into the era, I do not recommend if you are looking for serious research material."

SchysterShawn Michaels won the Royal Rumble"
3,They're Alright...,"These speakers have pretty good sound and look awesome, however, the light-up feature does not work very well. They speakers only light up when you play music that is extremely loud, so if you're planning on having these in a small room, you'll go deaf before you see them light up.Other than the lack of lights the speakers are pretty great, they were very easy to install and the sound is intense. The 'enhance' feature is very nice if you do not have surround sound capability.It also comes with a bunch of conversion wires, so you can plug just about anything into the speakers.They are pretty good gaming speakers, I'm just disappointed they do not light up very easily."
1,ok speakers... for a while,"after about 6 months the subwoofer started making a loud hum. I just turned the sub volume all the way, which worked for another 6 months, and now all the speakers make a loud buzzing (can't even hear anything anymore) so i had to toss it. i liked them when i first bought them and might have given them a favorable review, but take it from a guy who's owned them for a year - they're cheaply made."
2,Weight is Per Earring Not Total Weight,"Weight noted is per earring - NOT total carat weight. Too large for second (back) earring on my ears.As a result, I wasted nearly $10 for shipping from and back to because the description was unclear.Received item quickly and received credit for return quickly or rating would be lower."
4,If It Didn't Remind Me Of How Good They Used To Be...,"...it would get five stars.I hate it when the Roches go ""hah-hah-hah"" behind the lead vocal. That's their Partridge Family influence showing, and it compares negatively to the inventive harmonies of their first three records. But this CD is a good comeback from a few mediocre offerings like ""A Dove"" and their children's stuff. ""Christlike"" is as good as anything they've done. And ""I'm Someone Who Loves You"" is fun (you gotta love the way Suzzy says ""ragdoll"".You can go home, girls. You've done it all."
3,good..but..,"it has a bunch of great songs on it..but it gets old by the end of the cd..i mean..if you were to listen to one of these songs separately youd be like.""wow..this is pretty good"" but after hearin it over and over again it gets old...get it if you want..it wont necassarily disappoint you....its a good cd...just needs more variation"
5,Tis so sweet!,"I have been a Commisioned fan from back in the day. I bought this cd and first listened to it while making a 3 hour road trip. I know that the cars passing me must have thought I was crazy, I couldn't stop singing to the top of my lungs like I had lost my mind! Not only is it enjoyable musically,(the band is tight!) but the lyrics compell you to worship God. This cd took me back to times when songs like Secret Place, Tis So Sweet, Ordinary Just Won't do ,Hold me and many more songs helped to carry me through some testing times in my christian walk. Listening to these cds made me reflect on God's goodness and faithfulness and how He used Commissioned's ministry to bring me through. All I can say is THANK YOU LORD FOR COMMISSIONED!!!!!!!! Even if you have never been a Commissioned fan, get this cd, focus on the lyrics and you'll get what I'm saying."
5,YOU NEED A RATING THAT GOES WAY BEYOND 5 STARS FOR THIS!,"It is all that and some baby back ribs. This project is so tight it makes you want to slap somebody. WARNING: DON'T DRIVE AND LISTEN TO IT AT THE SAME TIME. The Holy Spirit will jump on you and you will have to pull over or risk an accident.From the initial ""triumpant entry"" to the ending JAM of ""Can't live without you"" this project has it all. For true COmmissioned head this is a no-brainer. For those who need to be convinced, the music is TOP NOTCH! complete with horns, 2 drummers, 2 guitar players, and FRED HAMMOND on bass! The backgroud harmonies - the best they have ever been. Most times a reunion projects is LESS than what the original were , but don't slepp FRED,MITCH,KARL,KEITH,MARVIN, AND MARCUS are are the top of there game.Hightlights? each of the 29 tracks is a highlight! What are you waiting for order it!!!! or get up right now and BUY IT! This IS the premeire music project for decade!!!! And we still have 8 years to go!"
2,For those who like it live!,"I Have been a Commission fan for many, many years. When I came accross this CD I became very excited. Here were the original members of my beloved COMMISSIONED, back together again, and performing all of my favorite tunes! Of course I bought it. However, I must say that I am somewhat disapointed.Perhaps its the fact that the songs were recorded live in concert. My favorite songs did not minister to me in the same way as the individual CD's had in the past. It was as if the new lead singer was trying the ""Out-Do"" the original members. As if he were trying to make his mark. On many of his solo vocal spots, he was yelling out the lyrics and not blending with the others. This was a major ""turn off"". In retrospect, I feel that I should have purchased a greatest hits type CD format. Peace!"
5,"THX, GREAT TURNAROUND",It was a Birthday gift for my son... and HE LOVES IT...Quick Turnaround. I got it before his birthday!
1,Propaganda,See what the filmakers learned from Adolf Hitler's use of the media as propaganda. They learned from the best. A complete joke. Pure fiction. Dangerous to freedom loving people the world over in the fact that some actually believe this.
1,Tripe,A hastily made rebuttal to F9/11. It's only purpose seems to be allowing those who can't stand the truth a way to sleep without their usual Valium infusion.
4,Nice counterweight to Farenheit 9/11,"It provides an excellent retort to some of the reckless propaganda in Moore's movie. It's intereseting to note that Captain Video provides the only negative review so far. However, his entire commentary is based on associations that the movie has and not the content of the movie. I looked at his other reviews. Pretty predictable stuff: 1 star if it has a conservative slant and 5 stars if it has a liberal slant. He decries this movie for having a conservative bias yet his review of Moore's film doesn't admit to any liberal bias! What an intellectual fraud."
3,Bush propaganda,"I thought this movie was going to give me a different point of view for the issues brought to our attention in Michael Moore movie, like Saudis tie to bush family for 30 years and Dick Chaney profit in the war on Iraq as CEO of Halliburton, but it really have nothing to do with those issues. This movie is more of right wing propaganda from Bush supporters of his disastrous foreign policies."
1,Celcius 331.11,"Cannot rate, not yet viewed. Too bad I must show some sort of rating in order to make a comment. The same applied to my comment on Farenheit 9/11."
1,All around bad movie,"I had a friend who praised this movie for debunking F/911, which it does fairly well but id have to say that this was the most boring 2 hours a person could live through, they could have put it together a little better then just some Q & A. If anyone were to see this movie wanting to know the truth behind Fahrenheit 9/11, I can asure you that 45 min in to it you simply wont care anymore. I suggest you watch ferhenhype 911 it's a much better movie"
2,Undisguised Propaganda,"You can tell when someone is at least attempting to offer an honest point of view; in the case of Celsius 41.11, Knoblock distorts the facts and hide some information. To excuse President Bush's inaction after his reception of the Presidential Briefing, you hear, from a talking head, that Dr. Condelezza Rice ""made it clear that the Presidential briefing offered only historical info""; if true, why was most of the document heavily censored and classified ever since?To explain why certain American citizens despise Bush and link him to Nazism and facism, another talking head explains that, in time of war, fear and paranoia (he really meant ""ignorance"") will result in citizens blaming their leaders... However, which is coming first: the fact that Bush is inciting fear, or a useless war...?"
2,Not really a rebuttal...,"Upon hearing about this film, I expected it to be a point-by-point rebuttal of Moore's F 9-11, but it's not. In fact, I really don't know what their point was. They quote Democrats out of context and have a series of speech blurbs that don't really mean anything. The end of the film is basically a long session of Kerry bashing, which has little intellectual meaning - it doesn't shed light on the F 9-11 issue. The film makes Bush appear nearly saint-like, and is right wing propaganda at its best. However, I suggest watching F 9-11 first, then 41.11, and form your own opinion."
1,Right-Wing Propaganda,"You know when the director is listed as ""Citizens United"" that there is ome sort of bias inherit in the film. This is one of the most blatant pieces of right-wing propaganda I've had the displeasure of sitting through. If the purpose is to present a critical, unbiased analysis of Michael Moore's film, then they have failed miserably. It is perfectly legitimate to question some of the fact's on Moore's documentaries. He does present many facts that are questionable. But, this documentary presents Bush as a saint-like figure, and the liberal ""nutzo's"" as deceitful, un-Americans scumbags. If you are interested in any sort of intelligent debate, look elsewhere. This is strickly for the Fox News crowd."
3,The Human Torch,"Okay the Fantastic Four movie was good,and here is The Human torch.The articulation is 27 points,decent for a figure its size.However,this figure looks nothing like Chris Evans.The figure is not much fun,epescially if you dont have anyone else in the line (I also have Dr. Doom).Still, if you are a fan of of the character and,or,movie,you will love this figure."
5,The Country Love Quilt,When I saw this book at a friends home I knew I had to have it. The templates and instructions in this book are the best I have seen.
2,Country love quilt,"I am not sure if I have enough experience to use this book. This book contains only one project. Thus, if you are new to quilt, I would recommend you try the book on Tips on Quilts. It is better for beginner. As for this book, I would not recommend for beginners. P.S. I was forced to select a field in the age column but it has only up to 11 years old. I would like to remain at 11 but I am aleady 37 yrs old."
4,Fun book,"We are using this as part of our homeschooling study on Egypt. It came in and she immediately took the stencil and started to write about everything she could think of. There are several pages around here.The one drawback is that it's really meant for kids. It's not really comprehensive and only covers some of the symbols. But really, for playing around, it's lots of fun and you will learn something."
3,This was funny but not as funny as most of his shows.,"This show seemed to be a little slow paced. It took quite some time before you burst out lauging, but I would still reccomend seeing this."
2,Skewered,"Just read the description too quickly and ordered. I thought they already had the meat on them and would be sent with proper packaging to accommodate (like Omaha Steaks or whatever). But instead I got a big box with a bunch of wooden, flavored sticks in it. Some made (our) meats tasty-others were too strong."
1,Boring,"I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and also a fan of classical music. I was so anxious to see and hear this dvd, but in five minutes I realized I'd been had. First of all it's unauthorized by the band. Secondly, the compositions were so simplified I felt as if I were watching a middle school stringed quartet. Many times they were half way through the song before I recognized what they were playing. A real boring disappointment. Too bad I had to give it an undeserving one star. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Boring,"Being an old muso, I was interested to hear a 'classical' dealing of Floyds music.Don' t bother.Whereas Floyd (with and without Barrett) had passion and drive to their music, a string quartet, no matter how good, can't replace a thumping bass and a big drum kit.For about 20 minutes, this sounded quite nice. But after listening to aural sugar for what was supposed to be flat out Floyd, I could stand no more.An interesting concept but it doesn't work.David"
4,Good Axe for double-bit,"Not sure about another review, axe heads were cast for thousands of years - forging is a relatively new art to axes - might recommend to that customer to learn how to sharpen an axe.This axe is light, swings well, and if well maintained, will hold an edge. Weight, handle and balance are important on a double-bit, assuming you are really working the axe, and this one works. The hickory handle gives you rigid control, while the head is, I am guessing, 16-18 ounces - so it is fluid in the swing. If you can bring the edge to about a 30-degree edge with a machinist's file, it will cut paper - let alone a long on a full swing.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, because it is about 4-1/2"" blade length...they should have arc'd the top of the axe a small amount to give it a 5-1/2 - 6"" blade surface, to reduce the work while keeping the weight light - but it is still a good axe."
3,Not what I expected from a TRUE TEMPER,"I was somewhat surprised at the quality of this True Temper axe. I have had other true temper items in the past and they all seemed rather well made,not so with this one.The first thing I noticed was the handle had heartwood and a knot in it, plus the grain was cross way not longways.Second, the head was not seated all the way down to the shoulder.Thirdly the head surface is very rough looking, the blade actually looked crooked.I have not used it yet as I'm concerned about it's safety, but I will give it a try and update my review accordingly."
2,wood handled 2 bit michigan axe,"It arrived quickly but, the wooden handle was split! I feel that the quality control area was not working that day for sure. I then returned it due to the split handle and purchased a fiberglass handled 2 bit michigan axe instead! I really think if the wooden handle had not been split, i'd have kept the first one."
5,Great watch!,"This is a great product - I think the burned calories may be a bit on the high end, but i'm just trying to get an approximation. make sure you read the (small) manual because there are a LOT of functions on this watch. chest strap's tag is a bit annoying."
2,heart rate monitor,I find that the heart rate data is difficult to read while running because of the size of the numbers on the screen.
3,OK...for a while,"This is the second Timex HRM watch that I have owned. This one was actually for my husband, but the watch is small and the strap for the HRM is tight; therefore, mine by default. (We feel that this watch should ONLY be advertised for women - not unisex) The first one, which was an older model (by one year) and a different color, lasted about 3 years. This one lasted about 1 1/2 years. Regardless of how many times I have changed the battery, the watch will NOT give an accurate heart rate reading or one at all. It transmits the beat of the heart and either displays dashes,30, or 224. Unfortunately, these watches are programmed to ""wash out"" within a period of time which is a shame. I am searching for a new watch and don't think I will get another Timex. I would love to know how to fix this problem."
2,Older eyes can not see display,"I was excited to get this heart rate monitor because it had so many good reviews. But I was disappointed and returned it the same day. I am 49, so have to wear reading glasses to read and I could not see my pulse rate withour glasses, which I won't be wearing when running! So I went with a simple Polar pulse rate monitor that flashes the pulse rate the whole time you are working out and the number is very large so can be seen without glasses, and in low light!"
2,Great product if it worked better,"After purchasing this product I used it for 3 weeks and learned all it's features. It always started out fine until I started to run on the treadmill, then it would work fine for a while, then it would drift from a reasonable heart rate (i.e. 125 BPM) to either a low rate (60-80) or a high rate (160) when I had not changed my pace at all. I called Timex support and they suggested I try to put the transmitter on when I wasn't at the gym. At first I thought this helped, but the problem recurred. I tried wetting the transmitter contact pads as much as possible and decided as much as I liked the product when it was working properly, I couldn't solve the problems, so I returned it to Amazon."
4,Great price..... for all that I need,"Easy to use, this item is not so sofisticated than anothers, but the price is the best"
4,Timex T5H881 Heart Rate Monitor,"This is my first heart rate monitor purchase and needless to say it satisfied my needs. It has very easy instructions to follow. Although the package came with three seperate books which was a little difficult at the start to figure out which one I needed to read for the overall setup (date, time, heart rate, etc.). The only negative thing that I have to say about this product is that the receiver band does seem to get a bit uncomfortable during and after an intense workout whether its a run or circuit training. I would prefer a little wider band for the heart rate receiver.I would recommend this product to a friend if they've never owned a heart rate monitor."
2,BEWARE! This is a WOMENS MODEL WATCH,"I have the mens model but wanted a second one for a friend so I ordered this. Nowhere in the description does it say it's a women's model. Functionally I'd give it 3-4 stars. The chest strap is a bit small and it doesn't pick up the monitor as consistantly as a Polar. I give it 2 stars for the poor description that fails to mention it's a women's model. But for the price, it's pretty good, and my mens model of the same type has lasted very well. Just make sure you're getting what you want, men's or ladies size."
1,A Death Grip,"The strap is uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Very very uncomfortable. I am pretty sure wearing the strap is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. If it's not, it should be.This baby is going back to Amazon.Tomorrow.First thing in the morning.USPS First Class.Oh yeah!Did I say the strap is uncomfortable? Very uncomfortable? Very very uncomfortable?"
3,chest strap heart rate monitor doesn't last,"The watch is good. The information that it provides is what I need. The numbers are big enough. The price is good. The only problem is that chest strap heart rate monitor stop working in one and a half years. A friend, that I recommended the watch and bought one, had the same problem. Since you cannot get a chest strap replacement you need to buy a new watch"
1,How long have they been making watches?,"The display is too small, now I have to run with my glasses on. The wristband only has one catch after the pin. Every watch I've ever worn has two. When there are words on the screen, some of the letters are very goofy looking; it's as if you're wearing a watch from the 50's and they haven't quite figured out how to make all the letters legible.Quite disappointed; I thought buying a timex would mean time tested quality from start to finish. not so."
3,Good solid watch,I have had this watch for a couple of weeks to monitor my heart rate during the day. It works quite well for this. I see it advertised for use during exercising but I would not recommend it for that. you need to wear it and use one hand on it for several seconds which is not how I would have available during a workout. I use a watch with a chest monitor during workouts.This watch works great for quick check. Nice and light.
3,I think it's off...,"Shipping time was quick, and the set up is simple if you follow the manual. But, I think that the monitor is inaccurate. It tells me that I burn 1400 cal. in a half hour elliptical run. I'm 5'7 and 130 pound, so I don't think I can possible burn that much in such a short period of time. I will go out this weekend and try others at my local sporting store just to make sure."
2,Dont waste your TIME,"Chose this particular heart monitor based on specs given and price, but never got to use it as planed. Wouldn't work right out of the box. The computer wouldn't set properly during set up. Buttons were sticking when trying to set up the monitor. Sent it back the next day and went out to buy another brand."
2,Too small,"When compared to other HRM online, I assumed it was large enough for male wrist. Wrong. It was so small that I tried it on once and realized that ""this watch won't work"". Went with a Suunto."
2,Broke within 7 months,"I liked the watch when I got it; easy to read, nice features, well sized, affordable. But 7 months after I got it the HR button didn't work, then it died all together. I sent it to get repaired because Timex honors a 1 year warrantee, however, I not only had to pay for shipping to get it to them, when they sent me a new one it came with a bill for them to ship it back. It seemed like a slap in the face- they sent me a defective product and I get stuck with the shipping bill?I expected more from Timex. That's just poor customer service."
3,Timex T5H881,"The product works well and as advertised.The product, however, differed from what was described when I called for information.The watch face is smaller than anticipated (I was told this product was suitable for a man or woman's wrist) and the heart rate display size is quite small."
2,Quality Issues,"There is no need to go into details on this watch's functionality as there are many good reviews to this point. Truth is, it is easier to operate than any Polar watch (I've had a couple) and should give any runner, except for the elite enough features to train completely.My main complaint is the quality: The HRM strap I received was defective, so I returned it and 2 months or so later received a replacement. Now the replacement HRM is not working right and so I have to send it back. Luckily, it is still under warrantee. The long and short of it...I've bought a USED Polar watch to keep me going while this one is getting repaired, so it might be worth the extra $20 or so dollars to get the Polar R100 and avoid delays: it's like needing a car to use while the new one is in the shop!"
5,Timex T5H881 Trainer Digital Heart Rate Monitor,"First of all, the delivery was a day or 2 sooner than expected. I spent allot of time on line researching heart monitors before purchasing. I wanted to make sure I purchased a heart rate monitor that would work in an athletic club, i.e. spin class, therefore the Digital monitor was the way to go. I also wanted the monitor to be easy to use and read. I had it narrowed down between the Pulsar and the Timex, as both appeared to be Digital and easy to use. I chose the Timex due to the fact that you can change the batteries yourself vs. sending it back to the manufacturer. I have used the watch about 5 days/week during exercise including running, biking and even group classes in the gym. It has worked great! I am very happy with the purchase."
1,Poor Quality,This heart rate monitor worked fairly well or consistently for 6 to 9 months but it rarely works now. I have changed the batteries but the problems persist. On the rare occasions when the watch picks up a signal from the transmitter it us usually highly inaccurate and far above my maximum heart rate. I suggest spending a little bit more money on a higher quality monitor that also has more functions than this one.
3,"Works, but too small.","The watch is childs size. Chest band won't fit a 46"" chest. Too small for a mans wrist and display too small to read when running. Gave it to my kids."
5,Timex Digital Heart Rate Monitor,"I am very happy with my Timex digital Heart Rate Monitor. I have never used a HRM before and found it quite user friendly. I have found it is helpful for monitoring the intensity of my workouts. I enjoy using the HRM during a workout and the Review function after a workout to see how well I am doing and if I have improved my average heart rate, peak heart rate and calories used etc. The watch is very light to wear and the monitor is quite comfortable also."
4,Complex to Use But Useful,"If you're the kind of person who never reads instruction manuals, this won't be the product for you. It's loaded with features, few of which I'll ever use. It's also reasonably comfortable to use, although the chest monitor's strap was definitely designed for the toned and skinny. This was a very good deal (on sale) when I bought it, so I'm pleased but perplexed why Timex couldn't find an easier way to make it work!"
4,Timex T5H881 Zone Trainer Digital Heart Rate Monitor,"Very easy instructions for setting up and using the heart rate monitor.Includes a helpful guide to using a heart rate monitor to increase your performance.You can tailor your fitness training using the 4 programmable zones. Again set up is quick and easy for each zone. You can select a zone and set it to alarm when your heart rate is above or below the values you have entered. I found this very helpful during recovery days.This is the Unisex model and the chest strap is quite snug at it's fullest length. I have a 38"" chest so you might want to take this into consideration before purchasing."
5,Perfect!,"After so much trouble with my Bowflex HRM, this is a great find. Easy to use and lots of workout info."
2,Timex T5H881 Zone Trainer Digital Heart Rate Monitor,"the website description doesn't give a clue as to the size of the watch. This watch is very small for a man's wrist. Display is hard to read. Instruction booklet minimal - had trouble setting the watch, especially the body weight entry which is needed for calories burned. I have returned the watch and was surprised to find that Amazon paid return shipping. Conclusion: watch and instructions poor...Amazon customer treatment great...everything according to customer expectations and More..."
3,Good monitor but odd fit,"Heart monitor works very well. Great tool for increasing your intensity. However, watch is very small/thin and the can be hard to read. Not thrilled with fit of chest strap."
1,Poor craftsmanship and customer service.,"Within 3 months after I purchased this heart rate monitor, it quit working properly. Instead of reading my actual heat rate, the watch would stay on ""30"" and occasionally read up to ""34"" or ""35."" I sent this in to the Timex warranty department and received it back in about a month... along with the eight dollar bill to ""fix"" it. The only problem is that it still did not work. It's like no one tested it before sending it back to me.Looking for better quality next time."
4,Good choice,"Bought this for my dad a couple of weeks ago(70 yrs+), and he's been very pleased with its performance and ease of use while using his exercise bike and doing calisthenics."
2,The directions are terrible,"I have had this heart monitor for less than a year, and I am already having problems with it. I want to find how to get out of the loop of Lap & Split, I can't clear the review mode so I can't record any new workouts. There is NOTHING in the directions on how to fix this problem. My spinning teacher couldn't even help me."
4,Good Watch,"I like this watch. Much better than my first heart rate monitor watch, a polar. The digital signal on this one gets less interfernace, it has more features and you can replace both batteries yourself. I don't think I will buy a Polar again. I do wish I had purchased the T5H911 instead becuase this one looks a little small on my wrist. It fits fine. The band isn't too tight infact I have two or three holes to spare and I am a pretty big guy, 235 lb. I would like T5H911 becuase it's a little bigger and this one looks small on my wrist. It's a minor issue. I very happy with this watch and have no problem using it for my workouts."
2,disappointed,The watch and chest strap need to be described as small size. they are a very small medium . the wrist strap just about closes. the chest strap is on the widest adjustment possible.so in my opinion the description of this prodect is wrong.however it works just fine.
2,Fix the description,This is a women's watch. The description should make this clear. Don't make the mistake I did.
3,too small,"el reloj esta chevere,,, solo que es muy pequeno, lo que no me gusto es que no mide distancia, solo tiempo y el ritmo cardiaco."
4,Casio Men's Watch #AQ163W-1B1V,"Casio Men's Watch #AQ163W-1B1VNice to wear, comfort. Easy to adjust the time and date. Reasonable price to purchase."
5,The Silent Master,Words breathing fire yet so calm deep and peaceful. I bow down before George and offer my respects. Brilliant Beatle. Wonderful Wilbury. Stupendous Solo-artist. Energized Eric loves it.
2,"Sorry to spoil the party, this set is only for beatles fan","and harrison fans.I am not a beatle fan, but in the 70's had some expectations from harrison, that somehow his genius had been overshadowed by Lennon and Macca, and there were some hints in his eraly releases , especially in all things must pass.However in this whole set, there are one or two good songs in each cd, and one or two others that could handle more than one or two listenings, the rest is ininterresting and mostly has aged very badly.I have listened quite a few times to this set hoping repeated listening will change my mind, but all I can say is that capitol should release a best of the dark horse years cd (with 18 tracks), and for the time being mots normal people could skip this and could go only for the Live in japan dbl sacd, which includes most of the Harrison you will need to hear."
1,I wish I could discover this set.,"$106 what the heck were they thinking off. This should have been split up some way so you could build the collection slowly(and when I had the cash to splash). What if you buy it and dont like all of it or any of it? This is only for the wealthy punter, I like George Harrison, but I'm not taking out a lone to get this. I suppose people will have to down load it from the net and burn it on CD for free.Even the DVD will be availiable to burn soon. No wonder record companys are loosing money."
4,"excellent CDs, but the DVD....","I love George. I am extremely happy to listen to all these songs, both familiar (""Got My Mind Set On You"", ""All Those Years Ago"") and unfamiliar (""Beautiful Girl"", ""Life Itself"", ""Your Love Is Forever""). All these once rare treasures of material are excellent, although I do share the same complaints as the other reviewers (the ""Somewhere In England"" fiasco, ""The Hottest Gong In Town"", exclusive ""Best Of Dark Horse"" tracks, Traveling Wilburys, etc.). The CDs don't even run 50 minutes apiece, but that's okay.Now, on to the DVD. It's great to see the music videos, but where are the videos to ""All Those Years Ago"" and ""Blow Away""? I saw little snippets of ""Blow Away"" at the end of the Dark Horse introduction, but they didn't include the video in its entirety. Inexcusable. This is the Achilles' heel of an otherwise perfect set, in my book.If your able to excuse the blemishes of this set, then take the time to rediscover the musical journey that is the Dark Horse years."
5,Great Collection,"I have always been a huge George Harrison fan so this review may be somewhat slanted. I liked the fact these recordings have all been refreshed. Each disc sounds fantastic. I had never heard the live from Japan recording and it is really well done and in SACD format. I enjoyed the videos and interviews as well. I always like to hear George Harrison's explanations of his music. The 33 1/3 videos were awesome. I can remember when he appeared on SNL and introduced the ""This Song"" and ""Crackerbox Palace"" videos. If you are a George Harrison fan then you must get this set!"
4,Justo a tiempo,Me llegó a tiempo parece interesante por lo que he ojeado mas no sé si su estructura se adapte para mi clase de AP Español. Cuando ya lo use en clase ya les cuento.
4,"Good enough, inexpensive","These scissors are inexpensive but good enough for what you need them for. Cutting armbands, tape, etc. The price makes them a good seller because if you loose them, it's no big deal. They are semi heavy duty, not cheap. I would purchase them again."
3,"Alright, smaller than expected","They are smaller than I had thought they would be. They cut fine, I tried cutting some fabric and it stretched out a few strings. I'm not sure what I will be using it for but I am sure it is fine...especially since it is such a good price!"
3,"Cut well, but not smooth motion","These scissors worked well for what I needed, which was general use in the operating room (cutting bandages, IV tubes, etc). I only gave them 3 stars becuase they were stiff and not smooth in the blade movements. They were harder to squeeze for cutting than expected."
4,A must have!,"Great tool for me to buy! They are a Nurses Must Have! I use them daily at work! And love that they come in a variety of colors, especially the color Purple!!"
2,Arrived looking dirty and used,"I'm requesting an exchange. I'll update my review once that is taken care of or not taken care of. They look like they work, but I immediately washed my hands after touching them. They should check their merchandise before it gets sent out."
3,They are OK,They aren't the strongest of scissors and aren't that sharp. I had to sharpen them before they would cut through ace bandages easily.
3,cuts well but are small,"this little, and I should really emphasis little, scissor will do the job but during traumas you really want some thing bigger and faster to cut with. this could get really annoying trying to cut with a little scissors like this."
1,Stainless Steel...I dont think so,Bought these because of the price so I could outfit a few different First aid kits. When they arived the blades look discolored and look an awful lot like rust. Not what I want when I am treating any kind of open wound!
2,Ames True Temper Single Bit Camp / Hunter Axe #118800,This is a cheap made piece of c#*p. Probally made in china like everything these days. You would think that an established name like Ames True Temper would be of better quality. Guess I was wrong. I would have given it one star except for the nice handle.
2,Pity Guatemala,"It shows that the book was written by a missionary, although the author tries to hide it. While he talks to many people, he does not really seem to understand them. He lives with fear, because it is new to him. He is upset when refrigerator and TV do not run around the clock. He never really immerses himself into local living, just visits it. He does not really bring anything new to our knowledge"
1,Book failed to fulfill its potential interest,"This book was not, in my opinion, very well written, more like a diary in its rough form than a finished work of literature. The potential for drama was certainly there but unrealized. In short, it promised more than it delivered."
5,Great Samba Installation and Configuration Book,"This is a must have for anyone starting in the Samba world. There are what seems to be billions of different ways Samba can be set up and this book goes a long way in discussing most of those configurations. The book appeared to be only about installation and configuration due to the fact that discussions on maintenance of the Samba environment were somewhat sketchy. But then again, rumor has it, Samba is an almost maintenance free package. I guess I will find out. This is the only book I have read about Samba and I do not think another one is required. I will be suggesting this book to my colleagues and hope to see another Sams/Carter book soon."
4,Excellent Publication...I've Got A Running Server!!!,"I found this book to be really useful. It goes into detail about a lot of networking items I would never have given a second thought to. Thumbs up for this one, Sams!"
3,"Sorry, but this is not five-star book.","At the point I'm writing this review, the book is rated five stars, and that is why I bought it. But I do not like this book more than average. The explanation rarely comes to the point. I never felt like this with true five-star books. But Samba is fun. With many things described in this book, we can do lots of magic."
1,Not clean,"The gloves are a little short, ypu can ask a bigger size.I bought the new ones, and they were not clean."
4,Gloriously Glorious!,"I bought this title as I do not yet own a DVD player - GASP! and cannot get my hands on Dress to Kill (DVD only). I very much enjoy Eddie Izzard's humor and his delivery is to die for! His brain must whirr along at the speed of light! As an Anglophile, Izzard's references to all that is British is great fun and a decidely delightful change of pace. I am carried away by his wit and charm and love his interpretation of the Bible to take us down, albeit ancient history, memory lane! His use of profanity is minimal compared to other modern comedians, so most audiences will tolerate him quite nicely. Eddie's a load of fun and I can't wait til I can get my hands on his latest romp into hilarity."
5,And he even does it in Heels...,"Just buy it man, You will not be let down I promise. First you might want to get your hands on ""Dressed To Kill"" which is even more excelent but don't watch them one after another because this one won't seem as funny. The humor in this video is witty, Izzard is kind of the thinking persons comedian. Instead of talking about farting (don't get me wrong. I find it hilarous as well) he talks about the old testament and vaccum cleaners and evil herbivores. His girraffe impression is not to be missed. Honestly, whip out the visa dude, it will be worth it."
4,I like my reviews like I like my women ... covered in BEES!,"*Glorious* is a lot of fun, but I think it lacked the polish of *Dressed to Kill*. There's something frenetic and ad-lib about the whole thing ... you get the very distinct impression, in a few places, that he's making it all up on the spot. This is fine because the man clearly has a talent for improv, but sometimes it's a little nonsensical.Gotta love him, though.I'm still running around fussing about how there are NO pajamas in the Land of the Dead!God, he's gorgeous."
5,Funniest man on the planet,"I laughed just as hard the 10th time I watched this as I did the first time. For a person more prone to amused snorts than outright laughter, that's saying something. It's not just that the lines are funny, it's his delivery. He is a master. Some find this to be not as good as his later stuff, but I'm not in that camp. 'Glorious' is different, and it's brilliantly funny."
3,A good Eddie Izzard fix for American viewers,"No, it's definitely not as funny as Definite Article. But, it is still very funny, and for those US based Eddie Izzard fans who are jonesing for a fix, this is a no brainer, must have. Besides, it does have the famous James Mason and Sean Connery impressions, as well as the hilarious computer bit at the end"
5,Glorious Comedy,"The 4th of Eddie's shows, Glorious cannot be described as the worst of the shows because they all do exactly the same thing..make you laugh, a lot. Hidden away in this surreal outlook is a incredible genius who doesn't bore on about Theory of Time, and even if he did, he'd probably pull it off"
5,wet your pants funny,"In Glorious he is one moment a balmy Prince Philip, slandering a billion Chinese on an official visit; the next he is the Grim Reaper, discarding, in the name of progress, his scythe in favor of a power mower. Mr Izzard is ticklingly entertaining hybrid of mainstream cultural influences and offbeat personal tendencies. He is without a doubt the funniest person either side of the Atlantic. END"
3,Glorious? Not so much,"Not as good as Dressed To Kill. There are truly funny bits scattered throughout, but you have to wade through the not so funny stuff to get to them."
3,"Good, but not his best","I just bought this yesterday, and couldn't wait to get home to watch it. While it was enjoyable and there were some very funny bits in it, it isn't nearly as good as ""Dressed to Kill"" If you have never experianced Eddie, and yes he is an experiance, start with ""Dressed to Kill"" before you see this one."
5,Grows on you like mold!,"The first time I saw Glorious, I thought ""that wasn't as good as Dressed to Kill"". But since then I have found that Glorious grows on you like mold. Eddie Izzard has such an interesting way of looking at the world! And many of the things that you don't laugh at the first time you see Glorious will drift back to your mind repeatedly, getting funnier each time.Every time I see this show, I like it better! I'm anxious for more from this brilliant comedian! This man has a gift for changing our perceptions of the world."
4,"Not Eddie's best, but still hilarious","I would have to agree with previous reviewers that this video is not as good as either ""Dress to Kill"" or ""Definite Article."" However Eddie, even in second gear, is still funnier than any other comedian around at the moment and that alone makes this tape an essential purchase.It's a pity though that they couldn't have included the whole of the absolutely brilliant ""Lust for Glorious"" mini-movie rather than just a 3-minute trailer. Perhaps on the DVD? Eh, Eddie?"
4,Watch out for the bird strike!,"Where did this guy come from? My daughter rented this Eddie Izzard DVD. I was blind-sided with the sophisticated, mime-style humor of Eddie Izzard (is this his real name? Is he really a ""he""?). From hearing about Genesis to wondering why Noah had to get two of everything... including ducks..., Eddie Izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy. Nothing was off limits... the Queen Mother, Death, hopscotch, speed archeology, toasters, and Achilles. It is all here!Take special note of the set... very minimalist. Izzard uses his talents to make you ""see"" what he is describing, without depending on props. From swords to Hoovers, you will get his meaning.Rated R for mild profanity, and I for irreligious."
5,exhaust yourself laughing,"Friends rented this for movie night and I had my apprehensions. but... I don't think anyone could put this in their VCR for more than 20 minutes and not be won over by Izzard. What an original! I already crave more, and will not miss his next visit.The show seemed long, but only because halfway through it, I already wanted to go review it, to recall all the funny stuff I'd forgotten. (I'm covered in bees... You forgot to give Maragaret Thatcher a heart...) Smirking even now."
5,Eddie Izzard Rules,"Eddie Izzard is an unusual and hilarious comedian, combining intellect and humor for a delightful hour and a half of comedy. This guy is funny and, although my mom likes this guy, yours may not. That is to say, that he does use the F word freely. But it's not wanton use of foul language born of comedic laziness but it might bother some."
3,The worst of his videos so far.,Eddie Izzard relies on old jokes from his Definite Article video and lacks the continuity of thought he is famed for. Try either of his previous videos to see Him at his most glorious. END
2,Disappointed,"The HBO special was hysterically funny. I had never heard of Izzard man before and looked forward to experiencing 'Glorious' as well. Just my luck, but the best I can say for this effort is: incoherent. Now I understand that this is how he works, but this time it just didn't come together."
2,Less than the best,"Once you have seen ""Dressed to Kill"" his previous stuff isn't near as good. I guess if I had sen this first, then I would probably have progressed with him."
5,If you ever dreamed of creating your own video games. . .,". . .then this book is for you. Heading in to college as a computer science major, this is what I pictured life would be like for my friends and me after graduation: renting apartments together and spending countless hours and late nights creating video games while eating pizza and drinking Pepsi and Mountain Dew (Coke is not allowed). Since then our lives have taken much different directions with me becoming a high school math teacher and my best friend moving from Chicago to LA to pursue a career in television production, but nevertheless it is an enjoyable and enthralling reminder of what we once dreamed. Not only that, but the story of what the Two Johns and an ever-changing cast of collaborators were able to accomplish and create makes it very difficult to put down.A must-read for anyone who ever dreamed of creating video games and/or is interested in the history of video games."
4,Good history and insight,"I've been interested in the 2 Johns (and Scott Miller) since I downloaded Commander Keen with my 1200 baud modem. David Kushner provides a superb look at the making of the partnership that led to that game and the path from there to Quake and Daikatana. The author tackles the difficult job of turning the true story of computer programmers into a compelling page-turner. Perhaps the personality of John Carmack is at fault, but I never felt I really got to know this brilliantly focused individual. I'm certain that Romero was an easier person to interview and much more fun to describe, but Carmack drove the success of id and after 300 pages I don't feel I learned enough about him."
5,A Must Read For Those Who Remember,"This book will take you back. If you ever rode your bike a mile to play just one game of Space Invaders, you'll relate to every word.Even if you weren't around back then, it is still a wildly entertaining book - a dramatic rise and fall, of egos and money, of friendship and fallout, and best of all - great games.Kushner makes you feel as if you're really there, which is, after all, the same feeling that made Doom so popular in the first place. Clever scene setting, immersive, packed with detail, and the characters are writ large.Don't believe the negativity - only the most myopic of gamers would dislike this book because the focus is more on the people than it is on the game. It's about so much more than just games - it's about other worlds. And it rings so true.I liked it so much, I read it twice."
3,so so,"I don't know why but I get bored reading the book, maybe is not the content, that is good, but maybe is how the story was told ..."
2,Disappointing for target audience,"The main story of Id was the revolutionary graphical programming by John Carmack. Although it is repeatedly mentioned in the book, it was very disappointing to find there was not even cursory explanation of his groundbreaking work. Most of the book is Geraldo Rivera-style hype, but shallow in substantial detail."
5,New Thought May be intrusting for gamers,"First of all i would like to say Hi to all gaming commnity..I am new to this community.I have some ideas to make computer games more realistic n fundo for gamers...it's for character based games...if we can use player actual mental status[highly energetic or dull]into games programming, it will be more realistic.I am working on some device which can measure this data n give output in digital format.What's opinion of u ppl about this...certain level reality will improve gamers craze....i have lots of thoughts n plannig for it...if anybody interester mail me..bbye"
4,Moviational Story of two blokes who made it happen,"They were young blokes who had a passion, and they followed it and changed an industry. I'm part of the Doom generation (28yrs), and I recall each and every one of the games they released. Never would I have suspected that kids in their early 20s were making it happen! To John and John, if you are reading this, then thanks for Doom. We'll always remember Doom. The book tells their tale, and inspires the rest of us to get off our large behinds and actually make something happen. Follow your passion."
4,Impossible to put down,"Impossible to put down best sums up this book. I glanced at it in a B&N store. Despite mediocre reviews on a few websites I thought I'd give it a quick skim. 100 pages later and still standing in the store I realised I had to buy it.The story covers the lives of John Carmack and John Romero - their childhood, early careers as programmers, the formation of iD and their subsequent fallout. A great book. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that I felt at times that the book was often trying to cover as much territory as possible, but at the cost of depth. I'd give the book 4.5 stars if I had the choice, really :)Still, extremely well written, worth the buy and inspiring for budding entrepreneurs and game developers alike."
2,Yawn . . .,"A coworker attended a seminar at the Chicago Gift Show recently and this book was highly recommended. I'm managing to slog my way through it, but it isn't easy. The author truly speaks as if he's back in the 1940's and does a lot of name dropping of famous people . . . are we supposed to be impressed? There's also a fair amount of bragging about how smart the people were at Neiman Marcus, how they were so innovative and how their techniques for marketing were then copied ""all over the world"". While there is truth in these statements, I get a little weary of hearing it repeated so often. I'm sure there's some useful information here, so I'll keep reading, but it's taking a major effort to stay interested."
4,Good Quality product - Installed on a 2009 Tundra,"This product worked as expected. Installed on my Tundra where I have large gaps Left and right, but a very small gap at the bottom. I needed to install a but extra material on the tailgate side for the top left and right to get a good seal due to the size of the gap. I feel it was just about right for the right and left side in terms of the thickness of material, but a little too much material for the bottom of the tailgate. It has been installed for two weeks and so far my stuff is still dry."
5,This was SWEET,"I had a blast hoarding every single Pink Floyd Album in this baby. Nostalgic memories. Still want to do it. But, nope, I got to many purchases on iTunes now and got way to many cds to listen to."
1,disappointed,Both Frame Carrier SATA 5.25 Hard-Drive enclosures I bought did not allow me to push the SATA cable on and snap it in. It just slides on and can fall off from the normal vibrations. I had to cable tie the SATA drive cables to an empty drive bay slot.I would not buy this brand again.
5,Fantastic!,"A bit flimsy, but installed easily. Have had it for years now and it's never failed me. I'd buy another!"
4,Great for Cloth Diapering,"We have 5 of these in various prints to use for my son's dirty cloth diapers and cloth wipes. We've been using them since we started using cloth when our son was under one month old and are still using them now that he's almost 9 months old. We have 5 so that we can use one every day that he goes to child care, and we wash over the weekend. They come in a variety of neat prints - I especially like the Dr. Suess prints. They are waterproof, so the wet diapers don't get everything else in the diaper bag wet. They also wash up easily in the wash machine and don't retain odor. We throw them in with the diapers and hang them to dry, where they dry quickly. My only complaint is that they're sometimes difficult to cinch closed as the fabric gets bunched up by the drawstring openings, rather than in the middle. I would prefer a zipper, but these were priced right and cute.We plan on using them throughout childhood as beach bags once we're done with diapers."
3,Not my favorite,"It's a cute book. Not quite as ""enchanting"" and ""whimsical"" as I was expecting but it's cute and my daughter seems to like it. I prefer rhyming books for her age (18mths) but the illustrations in this book are really good so that's a big plus."
4,Piggies,"My children have always loved this book. The illustrations are beautiful and the story line is fun for the kids. I thought I was purchasing the larger hard book for gifts but to my dismay they came as small 6"" book. Either way it is a great book to read and to look at. A winning combination!"
3,"giving it 3, would have given it 2","I dislike this book, i think it makes no sense and is confusing. That being said, my two year old likes it, so I rated it 3 stars. it really is just ""ok."" It really doesn't make much sense, my son is just obsessed with playing""this little piggy"" so i bought this book, thinking it was going to be similar, but it really wasn't. Definitely thought more from reviews. On a positive note, the pictures are detailed and gives my 2 year old stuff to ponder, he is constantly looking at the pictures because so much is going on. maybe the book will grow on me, I'll repost if it does."
2,Handles too small,The holes in the handles are too small for my thumbs. Makes them uncomfortable to use. They work fine otherwise.
4,Good Scissors,"These have seemed to work very well for us. They cut just about anything, look nice enough to go anywhere and can be easily cleaned. No complaints here."
3,Not heavy duty Kitchen scissors,These scissors will cut paper and will open chip bags. They are not sharp or strong enough for other jobs around the kitchen
5,Great Price,We use these as our kitchen shears and they were an awesome deal. Typically will go on sale for less than full price so would recommend waiting if not currently on sale. Ships free with prime. Awesome buy.
2,pretty basic,"These shears pretty much do what they should. My only problem, and this may be just me, is that they came way too tight. It hurt my fingers trying to use them. I finally removed the plastic cover and tried to loosen the screw. One attempt was successful, and these are the keepers. The other screw was so worn, I couldn't turn it at all. Those I just gave up on and dumped them. Thank goodness it's two pairs, this left me two options on which to use."
5,Basic Kitchen Shears,I bought these because the price was great for 2 pairs. So far I have not been disappointed. They perform as one would expect. I wash mine by hand to ensure that they stay sharp and do not rust. Would buy again.
1,Farberware not the same - made in China,"I have 20 year old Farberware kitchen shears that I LOVE and use daily. I thought I'd splurge and get a new (sharper) pair. I am so glad I checked these reviews and learned Farberware outsources its products to Chinese companies. For something I use every day, I don't buy Chinese junk - I don't need a bargain that badly. The Germans still make a great pair of sharp scissors."
1,Fell apart within a month,"I had some Farberware scissors from 15 years ago that work fine, so I got 2 more for around the house. Within 3 weeks I was screwing them back together all the time. My wife finally just threw them out. Junk."
1,Junk!,I'm returning these after the first use because after only one wash they won't open and close with out super-human strength. They seem like cheap junk.
1,Broke in less than a year....,Cheap components failed after little use in under one year. Not a product to be proud of. Who makes quality scissors these days?
2,Rusts already,"After 1 week of use, one pair of scissors has rusts on the tip and along the cutting surface. the other pair is fine."
5,A great season!!!,"Great season. Probably one of the best yet. Not the same as the original series, but good. I remember growing up with the original series when it premiered in 1998 in the united states. If I had to name my top favorite Pokemon seasons it would be. Keep up the good work!!!1. Indigo League.2. Adventures on the orange islands.3. The Johto Journeys.4. The Johto League Champions.5. Master Quest.6. Advanced.7. Advanced Challenge.8. Advanced Battle.9. Battle Frontier.10.Diamond and Pearl.11.DP Battle Dimension.and maybe 12. DP Galactic Battles."
1,No way! Hypothermia risk,"I'd not even consider this tent/bivy as it utilizes a cot that has air space underneath. This creates a heat sink where the cot cools until it's the same temp as the outside air (The Zeroeth Law of thermodynamics). That means you lose body heat. This creates a hypothermia danger in the same fashion that hollow air mattresses can. Don't use cots or hollow air mattresses unless ALL your camping is done in summer months, or you're sleeping inside a heated enclosure. Most hypothermia occurs at temperatures between 30 and 50-degrees F. A bivy enclosure that sits on the ground, coupled with a ThermaRest-type open cell self-inflating sleeping pad is the way to go."
3,It was alright,"Ok ok. This book was pretty good i have to admit. I had to read it for my english class with a group of friends. The thing i found most irritating is the way the people talk! I mean, its like Sir this and Master that and shall this and ne instead of no. I overall though think its a good book. I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone but thats just me."
2,"Grill work, IPOD function useless","George Foreman products are normally of good quality, but George receive a TKO (technical knock out) when trying to bring in the IPOD function to his grill, simply put it does not work, not sort of, zip, nothing...............not worth the hassel of sending back the grill works so George, stick to grilling!"
3,Love it BUT,"I just love my Foreman indoor outdoor grill. I live in a condo where propane grills and charcoal grills are not allowed. I have used my grill a lot over the 3 years that I have owned it but here is the downfall of this grill. After 3 years of use the nonstick coating is coming off of the grill and so far I have not been able to find a replacement grilling tray for it. I have been on the George Foreman site hoping to find replacement parts but nope they do not have them there. The 1 place where I believe it could be there are no pictures of the parts so one cannot be sure they are truly getting the part they need.If this grill had just a cast iron grilling pan without the nonstick coating it would rate a solid 5 stars from me.UPDATE: The a replacement grill tray is NOT available so if the non stick coating starts to peel, your grill is now garbage. SO I am looking for one with a more traditional wire grill rack to replace this one."
3,Does the job for apartment bbqing,"I used to have a propane grill for a few years. I recently moved into a high rise where they don't allow the real outdoor grills. So, I got this electric one and it does the job pretty well. Good for grilling streaks or chicken. My only big issue with it is that the lid is so painful to deal with when you have to snap it back on after cleaning the grill."
5,All The Literature You'll Ever Need,"This is wonderful stuff by a true comic polymath. Just read ""Likable Wilma"" by William Blake, which begins, ""Wilma, Wilma, in thy blouse, Red-haired prehistoric spouse"" , and you'll know what I mean. I have a conflict of interest here (I drew the pictures) but I laughed hard at Francis Heaney's work before I got tangled up with it, when I first saw it in Mirth of a Nation. Buy The Holy Tango today! The children of America should be committing it to memory!"
3,Fun to read,This was a really fun book to read. I'm glad that a friend of mine suggested it to me. The characters were easy to relate too and it was well written.
3,Tedious with a touch of funny,"The author of ""Confessions of a Super Mom"" does have talent and should keep writing. This book is fun, in parts, and, on occasion, is delightfully original. What mom wouldn't want the power to scare kids straight with her ""super mom"" gaze? However, Birdie, the protagonist, was tiresome. She lacked the sarcastic edge and witty comebacks that would have made her a more interesting or likeable heroine. She was... boring. I gave up reading when I realized I didn't care how the book ended. While I don't think this book should be ""buried in the compost heap"", as the author says she did with her first manuscripts, I do think it needs more work. I think this author can produce a funny show-stopping book. ""Confessions"" is a step in the right direction but isn't the destination."
4,Great Second time around too,I just got this book back from a friend and reread the whole thing last night. Can't wait to read a sequel!
3,Speaking from 80 years of quilting...,"I found there was not enough information about the pattern. I wanted to make a necktie quilt for my grandson from his late father's ties, displaying the whole tie, not cutting the material up. I found a picture of an example of a completed quilt like I wanted to make (A Lifetime of Ties), but no information such as the length to cut the ties. I figured it out, but it may be more difficult to someone with less experience. --Helen B. age 92"
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,"This is probably a great book for an experienced quilter, which I am not. I sew well, and wanted to make something from my deceased father's ties. Book was good inspiration, but most of the patterns were too complicated for me. I also found the multiple abbrevations too complicated to keep track of without going back and forth all the time. Again, though good inspiration, and I did find one fairly uncomplicated and useful pattern."
3,Anticipating!,The book looks very interesting but I have not had a chance to try making anything yet. Looking forward to some fun pillows and a lampshade.
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I bought this book to make projects from my father's ties when he passed away. I am not an experienced quilter and found the book to be pretty difficult. As stated in another review the patterns were not easily accessible and many of the projects were way too crazy for me to even consider. The patterns are difficult to use in that they are just a light grey underneath all of the writing on the same page! I would have preferred some basic patterns with simple directions so that I could preserve these ties in a memorable way. As it is, I have looked through it several times, but find it too overwhelming to follow. I hate to risk cutting up the ties and mess it all up."
2,Daddy's Ties is a bust,"Although the concept of the book, and the designs in it are good, the author got lazy and used a lot of abreviations that are not normal, and I found myself constantly referring to the front of the book to find out what the abreviation meant. A book with instructions on how to build a quilt should be eaiser to follow and not require you to thumb back and forth through the book.I am disappointed, as I love the quilts, just not the instructions. Why do authors have to get lazy?Beth G"
3,daddys ties quilt,"Overall this book has some good ideas for small projects and fabric preparation, but was a little shy on really workable ideas for larger quilts. I will continue searching for something with further possibilities."
4,Daddy's ties,"This book features a lot of different ways to use neckties and also gives some very helpful pointers on how to collect, prepare and quilt projects."
4,Great tie information for quilters.,I used the book and made four squares out of my dad's ties. The book is very informative and helps from washing to cutting up the ties.
4,It's a good one!,Well this defintly is a good movie but there is defintly better like Ski Movie or There's Something about McConkey. This sure is a good movie but it could use some more riders but overall a solid movie and a must get for ultimate skiers.
3,"Starts great, then falters","The Jeremy Nobis sequence at the begining of this movie gets your hopes up but a mediocre soundtrack and a few annoying voice overs put this at the bottom of my list when looking over my ski movie collection. (13, Global Storming, Ski Movie, High Society, and Propaganda)A must rent, but definitely not a must buy..."
3,Rurther skiing,"Enjoyable but not much skiing action more just extreme living amongst young ""dudes"". Probably wouldn't have purchased if knew how little actual skiing filmed but some interesting aspects to extra ciricular activities off the mtns."
3,So so.,"This movie has some great shots, but the soundtrack is pretty bad, I just turn it off. It also has a very unprofessional feel to it, despite some great shots. Overall, its ok, feels like TGR needs some fine tuning. The helmet cams are awesome, that needs to be used more often."
4,Old House Owner's Manual,"If you own or work on old houses this book is a great reference. It explains how to research and repair the plaster and wood surfaces in your home. As a DIY old house renovator it was full of useful information, and gave me a lot of insight into the construction of my house. However, it is not always written in really easy to understand terminology, so it can be hard to follow."
1,Don&#65533;t buy it!,Call professional - author's suggestion. Bellow zero - simple raving without any experience!
3,Bell bought for medical reasons,"This hand bell has become a part of caring for a family member who had a stroke and could not speak. Simply ringing the bell signals to us that this family member is in distress. It is one of the best things I've ever bought from Amazon.com. It is durable and the ring is very loud, which is what my family needs to care for our loved one. Thank you!"
2,Not what I expected!!!,"I ordered this bell based on how the picture looks...when it arrived I was dissapointed...The bell looks like a solid metal(didnt specify the material) but it LOOKS like its silver-tone plated...very cheap-looking. The SOUND, however is nice and loud."
1,cheap look-a-like,"Paper sticker on cylinder says it's the official Wright VH440 Door Closer. But, it isn't. Doesn't look anything like the two I now have attached to my screen door. Looks like a cheap imitation.Cheaper metal (visibly noticeable), different aluminum color, different fittings (one even with rust on it!). Also, Wright brand signature/identification not imprinted on cylinder. Paper sticker instead.Even so, ordered two and took one out of package to see if it worked. Cylinder makes noise as door closes. Exactly what the two I've had on my door for years are doing before they started to leak and why I ordered two new ones to replace them.I'm sending both back for a return on my money."
2,Poor performance,I installed 2 of the Wright VH440 black heavy duty hydralic closers on my front storm door. They worked properly for only 6 months. Both have developed very obvious oil leaks around the seals and now the storm door slams shut. Very disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with one main aspect of the Wright Products VH440 door closer. It seems that I have to open the door at least half way, before the closer will do its job. Since I usually only open it wide enough for me to pass through, the door often slams shut without the closer functioning at all. If I'm carrying something large and open the door wide, then the closer works good with a smooth and quiet closing. I paid more because I thought an oil-filled closer was better, but it is not working out for me."
1,The Old Bait and Switch,"As I write this review, I'm looking at an image of the product I ordered in the upper right corner of this review page. To make a long story short, what I received came in a very different looking package and the unit items provided crumple in your hand and are useless. Also, I attempted to contact the seller via Amazon and have received no response.I order from Amazon regularly and I'm very pleased with Amazon's service. This is the first product I've ordered that turned out to be a complete bust.Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Nightside series almost as good as Dresden series,"The two have many simularities. The Nightside's hero is not quite as appealing as Dresden. But while the Dresden universe is incredibly organized, Nightside is chaos. The Nightside one may not be better, but it does give you a very different perspective from Dresden. Also, while Dresden's magic is always available, John Taylor's ""gift"" can only be used in extreme emergencies because it alerts his enemies as to his location. Nightside also has ""possible awful future"" that Taylor is said to have caused hanging over him. While there is a heavier air of cynicism in Nightside in Dresden, ""Hex in the City"" has a completely unexpected tears-of-joy ending that truly makes you believe in the power of good over evil. It is the best of the four, but you should read the first three too."
4,Always a surprise with The Nightside!,I love the Nightside series! Its such a uniquely strange and dark series where nothing is what it seems and your last hope could eat you for a snack...
4,Super Reader,"We discover more about the Nightside, here, and learn that John was apprenticed to Carnacki the Ghost Finder.After an auction for the Chaos Butterfly that does not go well, Lady Luck turns up and gives John a job. Given it is one he wants to do anyway, he is happy to stick his nose in, and go looking for the origins of the Nightside.This is all tied up with who his mother is, the thing no-one will tell him. Taking a Sinner, Demon and Madman with him, he goes questioning the Powers, and has to go past the Lamentation, Herne the Hunter, the Lord of Thorns, Merlin, and Walker and the Authorities to get there.Myths and Legends multiply it seems, in the Nightside.Very interesting stuff."
4,He's done it again!,"Once again Simon R Green has failed to dissapoint with his fourth installment in the 'nightside' series. Full of unexpected twists, turns and new characters to indulge in, this fast paced little book will leave you wanting more..Like other 'nightside' books, Green fans will love the little cross references to 'mysterie' and 'shadows fall'... a fabulous little book, I cannot wait for the next installment!!"
4,"Finally, a payoff!!","Ok, lets be honest: these books are not Shakespeare, nor are they meant to be. In fact, the writing can be downright cheesy at times, but it is hard not to get sucked into the world and the characters that Mr. Green created. In this one we finally get some payoff to the story arcs that have been building since the first book. One thing about this series, characters and themes tend to pop up again and again, and Mr. Green won't leave you hanging. Overall, this is a nice diversion from real live, but don't expect too much."
1,A strident and profoundly biased view of complex questions.,"In this book, Mr. Vryonis speaks for an institute whose avowed purpose is to propogate a particular version of history, a version which demonizes all things Turkish. In short, it's an unhelpful contribution to a complex--even Balkan--set of problems and an oversimplification of a quite complicated historical legacy. Look for more objective books if you need background on these questions: this one is a rant."
2,you CAN tell a book by the cover.,Why read a book when the cover has an apostrophe that doesn't belong? Now THERE'S an unidentified flying object. Forget this hooey and read something that will educate and/or entertain you.
4,UFO Skeptic,I have recently finished the book. He not only made me aware of the misuse of UFO reports but also on Project Bluebook.
5,Wondrous book,"Finally, a book of Irish stories that truly captures my heart and does justice to my ancestry. A wonderful job by the author of providing background and such. My favorite legends are brought vividly and hauntingly to life; I couldn't have asked for more."
5,My favorite book,"Of all my books, this is my most important - the one I keep by my bed just to open up and read. It is filled with post-it tabs.I agree with all said in other reviews. But for me, it is not the sort of book one reads cover to cover. It is a source for spiritual nourishment, guidance and encouragement on an as needed basis."
5,Simply the best...,"""The Conferences"", alongside ""The Sayings of the Desert Fathers"", has been one of the most influential books for me. If more people read St. Cassian's work, they would be better focused on Christ and more equipped to abide in Him. More people need to read this great work. Here are a couple quotes (keep in mind that the entire work is filled with such wisdom):""A person can be broken more easily by prosperity than by adversity."" -- Abba Theodore (6.9.4)""The one who realizes that more has been forgiven him begins to love more."" -- Abba Isaac (9.15.3)St. Benedict made Cassian's ""Institutes"" and ""Conferences"" required reading for his monks. He also used a large part of both as a basis for his rule. Why not read a book that influenced the saint that formed and influenced a large portion of monasticism in the West?I agree with all the other posts."
4,So Very Funny!,"Mr Bean did it again, he managed a way to find trouble and make it funny. In this viedo, Mr Bean's day starts off with a trip to the Dentist. In the second feature, Mr Bean makes us laugh again when he finds a man having a heart attack at the bus stop. This video is extreamly comical, and I would recomend this to anybody."
4,Great for daycare or school,"All three of my kids have these pillows and love them! They are self contained and easy for little hands to hold, even my 14 month old can do it. It is easy to wash, just toss it in the machine. The only thing I don't like is that it is sometimes hard to get the blanket back in the pillow and getting the velcro to close. This did not keep me from ordering this one for my son after having the ladybug one for my daughters."
5,Can't beat it!,I purchased this book for $0.01. It came in flawless condition and arrived within the specified period.
4,Excellent story of a woman with courage,"I thought this book was excellent and the story made me think twice about what I have and what other people live through. Zoya has true courage along with her RAWA sisters.It is so nice to hear that there are people behind the scenes still fighting for their country, especially women. I believe one day all their great work will help Afghanistan get back to the place their love and remember it to be.Definetly worth a read."
1,"Not worth it, buy the PR010",I bought this and the collet set for my Colt thinking that they were specially designed to work better with the smaller router. Not so. This is the most complicated system for a simple concept of collets. Buy the PR010 and use regular threaded collets.
2,Not what I expected,"The Bushing hole is not a standard porter Cable bushing size, which I did not gleen from the product discription. It is well made and was readily installed, however, not suited as is for the application I purchased it for .... now I'll have to purchase special bushings .... or not, I may just give up and use a standard router."
3,Was expecting more.,"First off...this is a good film...I was just expecting more.More what??? More footage...it's relatively short. More content...it's ho-hum. More umph...it's tame.The scenery is beautiful. The video is clear and crisp.I found it difficult to keep up with which location they were boating while I was viewing the DVD. Perhaps a little naration would have helped.I am a novice whitewater enthusiast (so those more experienced may disagree), but the stuff they were playing on only gave me a ""hey...wow...look at that ..."" a couple of times.It's good...I was just expecting more."
4,The reviewer above me obviously doesn't speak pidgin.,"Poor grammar? The book's pidgin English may often a nebulous maze to walk through for an untrained reader, but I find this book a lyrical joy to read everytime.The novel itself is a bildungsroman of heartfelt and often painful emotions: being tied to the land and exploited by the plantation, obligation to family, and the constant yearning after hope.Looking beyond the difficult pidgin ""grammar,"" this is a quick, but worthwhile read."
1,big mistake,"spent $500 for this phone. have have had for about 9 months. doesnt even have simple features like ring profiles such as silent or outdoors that the FREE phones have. just vibrate and regular ring. camera is AWFUL unless in bright light. phone freezes until i soft reset during or after i send a text message. no voice dial, which comes in handy when trying to dial using bluetooth headset, which surprise, it cant do that either. most applications such as making mp3's available as ringtones cost upwards of $20! Are you serious?!?! get a blackberry or iphone and stay as far away as possible from this extravagantly overpriced device *cough* piece of junk *cough*."
3,Mostly Works,"Crashes Bluetooth nearly daily. Reboots itself. Looses connection to my headset all the time; never separate the two or you'll cause it to crash. Web browsing is a study in aggravation and learning patience; I've given up on that feature. Nice to have my Address Book and Calendar hotsynced with my PC and be able to dial from it. Nice to not to have to carry a PDA and a phone. Can't wait until these things start working reliably in 10 years or so. No better option that I know of and most people will pretend that it works acceptably, so this will be about as good as it gets. Wish it was better, but it will have to do. I'm sure this will be lost in a sea of glowing paid reviews."
1,"If you don't need features specific to this phone, DO NOT buy it!","I made the mistake of purchasing this lemon a few months ago and have since learned what pain is when it comes to PDAs. This horror has lost all of my data TWICE, crashed regularly, and because of some strange bug that literally hundreds (if not thousands) of other internet users have encountered, now needs to be replaced. Again. Two days before Christmas. With no loaner from Verizon. Even about a year after its introduction to the public marketplace, there is still little support that--and this is important--specifically works for this model of telephone from Palm. My phone is now stuck in an endless reset loop and I will not be able to hear from my family until after Christmas because of Verizon's poor support policies and Palm's incompetence when it comes to support. Two big thumbs DOWN."
3,"700p, better then the 650","This phone is light years more stable then the 650, There is only one major flaw with the phone thatVerizon nor Palm have fessed up to our found a way to fix yet, that is when you have to many text messages stored the phone begins to freeze up when you send out new text messages. If you do not text alot and you primarily email this is not a problem at all and a clean up your texts once a week should mean you will never see this problem. However, if you are an avid texter, this is a huge problem as the more textes you have the longer it locks up everytime. This becomes no minor inconvenience. If this bug were to be fixed I would have no problems giving this phone 4-5 stars. (In veriznon's defence they have sent me a new phone hoping that it would correct the issue, it did not, where as palm just blames 3rd party software when there was none running)."
1,Stupidest phone you can get for $499,"If you have already bought his phone, you have made a mistake. If not, you are lucky to be reading this review.While it functions as a PDA, syncs upto your corporate email via Good Link etc., It fails as a basic phone. Has a lot of problems and is a poor quality phone."
1,Bad phone+worst provider,"On a technical side this phone sucks so so bad. It freezes 8 times a day, and i have to hard reset ( basically wipes everyoff the phone) . It froze so many time while making phone calls. Ok now to the provider. I cut the 10mb internet thing, thinking it was cut off . So i lend it to my son. He accidently logg on to the internet for 10 days, i didnt know. Ok so one day this big red envolope came from verizon saying ""Your bill has a new look!"" Piece of crap did have a new look , $2255 more look. Every day my son used the internet verizon charged some 200 bucks for a 10mb internet....10mb. So if you cut off the 10mb data usage watch out for these art-tarts money hungry slobs. I dislike this phone and i dislike verizon."
1,The phone is junk! Don't buy it!,"The main issues with this is that it will ""freeze up"" at least a few times per day. Once the the phone is in freeze mode, you cannot do anything with the phone except wait until it un-freezes or reboot it(take out the battery). It is powered by Mircosoft, that explains why you have to reboot it a few times a day. I am going to try and get my money back but I doubt that Verizon will give me any concessions. I am going to switch to a blackberry."
2,Not really Palm-like,"The Treo is more like a phone with some Palm tools slapped on as an afterthought. Many of the touch-screen features that I'm used to using on the Palm are relegated to the keyboard. The interface is archaic (think of the original Palm Pilots) and inconsistent from one application to the next. Contacts layout is downright sloppy looking. I found the keyboard very awkward to use, especially with the odd location of shift/command keys. I think the absence of WiFi is a definite disadvantage. If the Treo was more Palm-like I would have kept it. I decided to return it after one day. I know Palm is moving away from handhelds and moving toward smart phones. I hope they can do better than this. Unfortunately I'm somewhat limited in platform choices since my work and home computers are all Mac. Palm is currently my only platform option."
4,Treo 700p Rocks!!!,"First time PDA/phone user and I just love this piece. Everything about this phone is absolutely amazing (You must have unlimited data plan to enjoy all the features).The only issue I have is the music capability of treo. I bought a stereo headset hoping that I could use it as a mp3 player, but realized that it has a mono o/p & you hear sound only from one speaker (left channel).Palm did everything right, but this one. Hence 4 stars."
1,I returned mine after 19 days...,"I returned my Treo yesterday after 19 days. It you read every review with one or two stars you will get the horrible picture. They are not exaggerating, believe me!!! Mine had ALL the problems mentioned. I love the features of this smartphone, the touch screen, the stylus, the email thread....the phone has GREAT features that just would not work. Luckily I had Verizon service and they took back the smartphone with no problem. I was tempted to get another Treo but I had 19 days of hell with this phone. I loved this phone, I really did not want to give it up. I took a blackberry that works well but I still wish I had the Treo...and it was working. If they get this smartphone to work as it should I would definitely get another one."
3,Okay,I suppose for the price I got a good deal but I found that the edges fall off too easily and then the whole thing falls apart.
2,You get what you pay for,These are thin and flimsy and would not put a poster in them. I did put a certificate in this I needed preserved and it worked for what I needed it for. It is not special or flashy or sturdy.I would not purchase it again but now that I have it it works.You get what you pay for
3,It does the job,There is not to much to this frame but it does the job. I bought it to frame a Marilyn Monroe poster and it does frame it quite nicely but it isn't a very sturdy frame. Also the way the picture looks I thought it had a little shine to it but it's just all black.
4,It works as intended,It is an inexpensive poster frame. Works as designed and well enough for the price. I plan to order more for the project I am working on.
3,"Informative, but biased","I bought this for a speech I was doing on the seal hunt in Canada. I found it to be informative, but pretty biased. I should have expected that from him though because that is his job."
4,good death metal,"this is the first Kataklysm album i purchased. after a friend told me to pick up one of their albums i picked up this one, and i found it very good. Kataklysm is like the death metal version of Dream Theater. they are very complex at everything they do and their tracks are full of ear candy. most of the tracks are longer than most bands and they definitly don't have any filler. ""Epic"" is an album that all death metal fans should have."
1,Northern Hyper-Laugh - Ever had Canadian Cheese ?,"Predictable and cheezy. I sold my copy of this CD. You can sense the forthcoming sell-out. They tried so hard to make all these songs ""catchy"". Kataklysm have gotten worse and worse as time goes on; not that they were anything special to begin with.I would recommend earlier Kataklysm. Try Sorcery or The Mystical Gate of Reincarnation."
2,Uneven cuts,"The earrings were specifically cheap, I understand, but holding them closely you can see that the final cut shows a large square on the top of one earring and a tiny square on the top of the other earring. I guess when they arent together they will look fine but dont expect the earrings to look the same at all they are completely different but the same size. could have been better since they are in white gold, I would expect this lack of cut symetry in sterling......buyer beware...."
4,WOULD RECCOMEND.,These earring are worth the money. I got these for my boyfriend as a surprise and he really liked them. They are super nice and affordable and don't look cheap or anything. Great quality. Only problem was the backings don't stay snug enough but thats easily replaced by getting better backing.
5,STILL IN PRINT!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is still in print, & not worth $129 nor 100 dollars, man somebody is always out to rip other people off! Yeah it may not be as easy to buy, but this CD is still in print and available from Get Hip records: gethip.com The other album Konquer Kampus is available from Hillsdale records: hillsdalerecords.com So buy it, support minor labels, and enjoy it already!"
3,"Great performance, poor arrangements","The good:Four pretty string players and a skilled pianist play some of the more intriguing Genesis tunes. The track list is excellent, seeding some of the lesser known songs such as ""Looking For Someone"", ""White Mountain"" and ""Ripples"" amongst the more obvious choices, ""Lover's Leap"" from ""Supper's Ready"" and ""Los Endos"".The bad:All of arrangements seem to follow the same template. The intro is played along with the first verses and bridge. Then, rather than go into the longer instrumental sections which virtually define early Genesis material, the arranger opts to repeat the verse or bridge again. This has the effect of making many of the songs seem disjointed and repetitious, an approach that will surely annoy hardcore fans of the band.Recommend renting first."
4,Fast-paced witty fun,"Haiblum, as a writer, is very similar to Keith Laumer in style. His writing is funny, irreverent, smart-alecky, and yet firmly comitted to the reality of the plot and characters. He writes fast-paced adventure stories, always with a humorous twist, but the adventure doesn't get lost in the humor. This work is typical of his, I enjoyed it a lot. It's been too long since I read it to give any details, but I recommend it, along with most if Haiblum's fiction."
1,Such a dramatic difference in style from previous work.,"This book did not nearly rise to the quality of 'Juniper' and 'Wisechild'. It seems to lack knowledge of the context, which is very unlike the prior books. It almost seems to have been written in a different voice. Ahem. In my opinion."
5,I can't help but groove and love this album,"With ""We, the Vehicles"", ex-members of The Promise Ring and Dismemberment Plan have definitely put out one solid album that I love. The guitar work and bass lines are delicious!Don't expect The Promise Ring or Dismemberment Plan styles to show up, but you will hear their strong roots which equals no weaknesses. All I hear on every song are great melodies, sometimes mellow grooves, or just catchy rockers. I can't argue with this formula they came across because for me, this was the type of album I needed to hear and own. ""Tearing Up The Oxygen"" has to be the most powerful song on the album, but it's the most mellow, and that says a lot about ""We, the Vehicles"". I could go on and on about other songs like ""People, the Vehicles"", ""Don't Say You Don't"" or ""Young Alumni"", but an explanation doesn't do anything justice unless you listen to the album yourself.I know this for a fact, this album will definitely make you happy."
3,"It's good, but.....","This album would be fantastic if only they'd gone with J. Robbins production again. Overall the songs are better than the last album but I can't help thinking a lot of them sound kind of flat. (Where's the bass in Parade Of... and in several of the other songs?). It's not too bad and doesn't spoil the album completely, but I can't help thinking how much better it would sound with the really good production it deserves. A missed opportunity, I think. Sorry."
5,Great document of Upstate (NY) Industrial/Cultural History,"Great fun to read about an industrial manufacturer located 'way off' the main path of industrial America -- in Upstate NY! I worked @ GMC Truck & Coach in 1966 so I am fascinated with auto/truck assembly-line detail (several pictures of the inside of the factory in Syracuse). But a large part of the book is devoted to the individuals who ran the firm as well as interviews with lowliest shop floor seasonal workers. The company survived and briefly thrived in a hostile environment -- geographically & economically. I would have loved to see photos included of the car's laminated wood frame! Also, toward the 1930's when they used bodies from Reo (in Lansing Mi) was a real inspiration in 'modular assembly'!"
4,Flimsy but it works fine,"I have been using it for about a week. It works fine. I used to use IDE versions of these type of removable drawers so I am familiar with the use of it.In terms of price, I think it should be cheaper. But I still like it and I'm getting an extra drawer for my 2nd SATA drive.Make sure you have a long enough SATA cable on hand for the installation."
2,Cheap cheap cheap,Looks a mess when you actually place a poster in it and place it in the office it still looks cheap
4,Does the job for the right price,A very basic poster frame. Quick to assemble and stays together well. You simply won't find anything better for the price.
2,Doesn't Work as Advertised,"Really disappointed with this product. It advertises smooth, no bounce action. In fact, it's a killer door closer - it will kill you if you aren't careful. There are definitely adjustments you can make to mitigate the rapid closure rate, but it still has a massive, massive bounce before it engages - never seen a screen door closer with this much bounce. These are going back."
3,its OK,"its OK, nothing special, it doesnt have a water reservoir with it , so I had to buy a soda to use as a reservoir."
5,pet watering hole,I had one of these before. I've also have the one that is motorized and filtered. I love the deluxe cat fountain. you don't have to replace the water as often as the motorized one & less maintenance. The stainless steel dish inside is great to maintain sanitation.
3,If you like Midnite Vultures....,"1. What is the text about? A sort-of, kind-of tribute to African-American musical tradition2. What is good about it? The lyrics are kind of cool; the melodies are catchy.3. What is not so good about it? It seems to me that the album is a retread of other albums that have shown their connection to African-American music. And I can't tell if it's using it as a crutch or a tribute. Whatever it is, it's pretty annoying at times.4. Who might like it? It's in some ways a little more listener-friendly than When I Was Born for the 7th Time, and usually that's a good thing. It isn't for me this time, but it probably will be for others. Those wou like Midnite Vultures might like this.5. Personal bias: I really like Cornershop's last album and wanted to like this one more than I do. I don't believe in the concept of selling out."
5,Great Machine,"This is an outstanding built like a tank product. Does require a learning curve but not to bad, Would like to talk to anyone who has this to share ideas on operation. A definite buy if you find one cheap. nor@surfbest.net"
3,A nice introduction to the land of the Diamond Throne,"As with any anthology some stories in this set were better than others. Some were average some were quite good. Most had interesting characters and lots of action.The set also provided a nice introduction to the land of the Dimond Throne, the setting for Monte Cook's Arcana Unearthed RPG.My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that the authors seemed to assume that the readers are familiar with setting and used races and/or monsters that are unique to the world. This is fine, but in some cases I would have liked to have a little more description of these races in order to know how they differed from other fantasy mainstays (such as humans, elves, dwarves, etc). But this did not take away from the stories which were enjoyable."
4,"Inventive, masterful, excellent","Loved the babyheads. Loved this book, actually. Nonstop made-up fun. The plot's great, the characters are great, the writing is great, the author's imagination blows me away. This is such a good book. I'll read everything he writes."
4,"A wonderful first novel, first-rate story.","Jonathan Lethem had a strong start with this whitty, subtle and clever first novel. His character, Conrad Metcalf, is not afraid to admit he has an addiction and that he is less than savvy when it comes to romance. He is an imperfect protagonist in a world that is perfectly twisted and corrupt. Lethem keeps the tension strong throughout, providing the right amount of plot-twisting exactly when it's needed. This book is a recipe for an enjoyable read, for either the mystery or the SF fan."
3,Blade Runner meets The long good-bye,"How do you make an hard boiled Sci-fi story?Take a cynical but really golden-hearted (proportions of cynicism and goodness may vary) private-eye in less tan friendly terms whit the official cops,some client in deep [trouble] who's innocent,some big rich jaded family in murky liaison whit ruthless mobsters,some fascinating dangerous babe, some ghastly creep,and you have the hard-boiled part. For a Blade-runner-like scenario you have only to add an oppressive police-state regime, some creepy genetic extravaganza,an overall gloomy athmosphere...and the cocktail is done. Lethem knows it. What he did'nt know when he wrote this book is how to keep the reader interested. Exasperated,I flew toward the solution of the rather messy story and...my jaw fell to the floor,as I was literally flabbergasted. But I was not amused."
5,"Wow! A complex, incredible pulp Orwellian/Huxley novel","What a fascinating read. Lethem tosses off fantastic and compelling ideas like dirty socks. Each concept (Babyheads, legalized -no...forced- drug use, talking animals, the illegalization of the news) could be the focus of the novel but Lethem just uses these ideas as background for a pretty interesting detective story. What an incredible imagination and a knack for dialogue! One of the best books I have ever read."
2,"Excellent Command of Genre, just fails in the end","Its like Lethem got tired 2/3rds of the way through the book and just kind of threw the ending at you. Up till that point it is a fantastic, entertaining novel that manages to combine enough Huxley, Chandler and Dick together to make a very interesting and believable world. He really runs out of steam 2/3rds of the way through, however and it just feels like I never finished reading the book. The mystery gets wrapped up in exposition type of thing. Not fair."
5,Great Read!,If you like crime novels with a twist this is the book for you. I love this author and especially this book.
5,Great book!,"This book was wonderful! The author did a wonderful job in writing it. The vivid imagery and the great metaphors made the book extra exciting to read. The book had a weird concept which was awesome. Great read. Chapters were short so you felt like you were getting a lot of reading done. The only bad thing I can honestly think of was the amount of characters in the book. It was hard for me to keep track of who was who but maybe that is just me. Anyway, awesome book. Get it, read it, and of course enjoy the heck out of it."
2,"the stuff about pharmacies is good, but not much else","If you've read some other reviews then you probably know what the plot of the book is. He's what I didn't like about it:1.) The characters are rather dull and their conversations are fairly painful to trudge through.2.) No one in the novel is particularly likable .... or not likable. This makes the book a bit drab.Overall: Another interesting story / fantasy world made mediocre by the characters written into it (yes, I'm looking at you, JK Rowling)."
3,Gun,"It was kind of fun, I guess. But it felt like a big wink-wink, look at what I'm doing and see if you can catch my references kind of thing to me. Are Lethem's other books like this? If they are I doubt I'll give another a chance."
2,more style than substance,"Complicated murder mystery. The ideas that are supposed to make this book ""science"" fiction are not explained and are no integral, logical part of the story."
5,a terrific read,"One of the best sci-fi books i've read so far. A funny, cynical book who's more far out concepts are strange without being annoyingly trippy. I was attracted by the bizzare cover and facinated by the text. You have gotta read this one."
3,Pulp Fiction meets Animal Farm,This is my first book by Jonathan Lethem. The writing is witty and the future he has imagined seems oddly possible even though it's completely outrageous. I found myself almost immediately accepting evolved animals walking around the city without question. A great read for Sci-Fi fans and mystery readers.
1,Stupid stuff,"I started reading Jonathan Lethem with _As She Climbed Across the Table_ which I thought was funny, sharp, tho small . I've sense read ALL Jonathan Lethem books in hopes to finding an equal or better book. I found nothing but acid trip/opiate dream garbage/drivel. All overly detailed and quite boring, lacking in story. Stupid stuff. The only book of Jonathan Lethems I'd recommend is _As She Climbed Across the Table."
5,True Originality!,"Lethem copies no one in this book. Like a jazz artist that takes impossibly awkward rhythms and suddenly brings it all home to a brilliant, perfect whole (to everyone's surprise!), Lethem makes sense out of almost insane story lines. Lethem reminds me of William Gibson before he ran out of ideas. Gibson was the best in his day, truly original in every sense. My impression of Lethem, about a quarter through the book, was that ""He's not going to pull this off."" But he does! ""Gun, with Occasional Music,"" is a book you will think about for years after you read it. Is it profound? I'm still not sure. Like a joke that only Lethem knows the answer to, the book tricks the mind. One way or the other, the book meets the only true test: It is a fantastic read."
3,"Better Than Most, But Not Lethem's Best","I guess I hold a minority view here, I was somewhat disappointed by ""Gun, With Occasional Music.""The ""comic noir"" angle seemed overplayed, and the ""forced evolution"" trick served no real purpose I could discern. All the audaciousness and bold experimentation we've come to expect from Lethem was here (in spades... Sam Spades) but unlike, say, ""Girl In Landscape"" or ""The Wall of the Sky"" in this book they just made it seem mannered and self-conscious.Still a very entertaining read, and way beyond run-of-the-mill, but as someone who has written some of the most inventive current fiction, he has far outdone this book in later works."
4,grill cover does the job,This cover really does its job. It covers the entire RoadTrip grill. I recommend this for RoadTrip Grill users
5,Perfect!,This cover is perfect for my Coleman Grill. It fits perfectly and it is made of heavy weight material so I'm not going to find it blowing into the neighbors yard! Worth the cost.
5,Coleman Roadtrip Grill Cover,"Excellent product / excellent service. Grill cover is exacty what I was looking for; ordered on a Friday, received on a Monday. Cover is heavy duty and works great at keeping our grill clean."
2,Not Rain/Water Proof,"This grill cover does a good job of covering the grill but the cover is not rain/water proof. It keeps out the dust but not the rain. Had I used it and the grill just after I purchased them, in instead of months later, I would have returned them."
5,Perfect Fit and Quality Construction,Tailor-made for the RoadTrip grills and made with heavy-duty material. Couldn't be happier with it.
3,Oversized,The cover seems to very well built. My problen is that it is oversized. I'm not sure what the Velcro is there for. The cover hits the ground all the way around the unit.
5,N. Foster,The coleman Roadtrip Grill Cover was just as I expected and of excellent quality. I am very pleased with it. Thanks for the the excellent service.N. Foster
5,Works great,A great cover at a reasonable price. I expect it to make it through the summer heat and the winter cold. Better than some of the plastic junk sold today.
3,It Could Work,"The best way to use a harness with a D-Ring on the chest is to attach the leash to the d-ring on the harness and also the d-ring on the dogs collar. I had a harness similar and that was the recomended use by a trainer, forgot the brand name. When attached in this manner if the dog slips out of the harness he still is attached at the collar. You might think attaching it to the collar is defeating the purpose of the harness but it does not. The harness keeps the collar d-ring on the underside of the dogs neck and allows you better control over the dog. Without the harness the dogs collar and leash rotates to the back of his head and when the dog pulls you have little control. So if the front strap of the harness is loose enough give this method a try and see how it works out for you."
1,"Not a good choice for dogs that are ""low to the ground""","I had to return 2 of these harnesses (and got dinged a 20% restocking fee from this seller - on top of the cost of shipping both ways). This harness does not work with all dogs. Both my dogs fit the ""girth measurement"" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of ""short"" dogs that this would not be a good choice.If you want to try this out on your dog, buy it from a dealer who will refund ALL your money other than the shipping costs. It's too risky otherwise."
4,Easy Walk Harness,"Prompt delivery and good service. I have found that my dog can slip out of the harness by standing up on her hind legs, but she is a very small dog so maybe I should have gotten the smaller size. She is in the weight range this harness was supposed to fit. The harness works well to stop pulling behavior."
4,"So far, so good...","I only gave this item 4 stars because I just used it for the first time yesterday. I also have a small dog who thinks he is a sled dog. Upon using the harness for the first time yesterday I immediately saw a 50% improvement while on our walk. However, I do need to adjust the harness a bit more. I'm sure by the weekend I will see a huge improvement. Would definitely recommend this product. I wanted to try this halter first before having to try the tradional Gentle Leader head halter."
4,Kranked review,"I loved the views of this dvd. It was my first mtn. biking dvd purchase, although I have seen some others, I must say I enjoyed the footage of this one the best. A good investment to start your mtn. biking library."
2,Enjoyed the others but disappointed this time,I don't like the Aisling stories but I do like her other vampire stories. This was just too disappointing. Too many threads left hanging (read other reviews. Also the whole I lost my soul thing -it just seemed tacked on. I was very disappointed. I suggested you borrow this one.
1,Don't waste your time.,I am a huge fan of vampire stories so I tried to keep an open mind on this one until the very end. It turned out to be such a waste of time. Sigh.
2,Not one of her better ones,"This book really did feel hollow. The characters were indecisive. At the end it just felt like the author had no where else to go after all of that losing the soul, getting the soul, losing the soul.... So, she just made the bad guy a good guy and everything was restored. Why didn't the monkey god just go to them in the first place and explain if he was just going to help out in the end? Even the banter and hijinks was not as entertaining as prior novels. I hope as well that the next Aisling Grey book is better. With luck, this one stinks because she was spending so much time on the new Aisling. One can only hope!"
1,Hated it!,"It wasnt as funny as the other Katie Macalister vampire books. The main character Paen and Sam are annoying. They are suppose to find the stolen statue together but they have been manipulated and outsmarted right under their noses. Dont like Sam's cousin Clare who was more concerned about her ruined dress than being shot at. So what if its Versace and the faery in denial thing is so booohooooo! Anyways bottom line is Im disappointed with this book. Like the cover though! The story could have used some strong characters, wit and definitely more humor as expected from a Katie Macalister novel."
2,get it from the library,"If you have read previous novels by Katie, you come to expect great things. Thats why, while reading this mundane, so-so story, you are terribly dissappointed. Katie is churning out so many books, that she obviously has started to worry more about her requirements for her book contracts, than she is about her love of writing. Too bad. She used to be very good."
1,The Worst Vampire book I have ever read!,"Folks,don't waste your money.If you are a seasoned paranormal vampire fan.If you love Laurell K Hamilton and the like.Don't waste your money on this book.I read the whole book,thinking it would maybe get better.It only got cheesier.I felt the story line was so way out there,it lacked any credibility.There were Fairies,Ghosts,Demons,sub demons.In the midst of some hot and heavy action,the author put in an exclamation like""Crapbeans"",and used words like ""FengShuier""I usually save my paranormal books for my daughter in law,but this one went in the trash.If you are interested in this genre.I highly recommendLaurell K Hamilton,Christine Feehan,Sheralyn Kenyon,Angela Knight,among others."
3,"Better than usual, but the heroine still annoys and the plot falls short.","In some ways this book is the best in the series - the heroine annoyed me far less than Katie's heroines usually do, and the half-elf spin and added supernatural elements were well done. The hero was stereotypically appealing, and there were some good humourous moments and some hot sex. I enjoyed it, overall, but there were still little moments of annoyance with the heroine. Also, the plot was convoluted and contrived - had it (and the ending) been more solid, I would have probably given this 4 stars."
4,Loved This Book,"I have just found MacAlister as an author and I have to say this book made me laugh a lot. I enjoy some of the ""lighter"" vampire books and this one did not disappoint."
5,One of her best,"Katie MacAllister has been described as laugh out loud funny. I thought that was ridiculous because no book has ever made me laugh aloud. I started with her dragon series and found myself laughing and could not wait until I could find another series of hers. I find these ""Dark One"" books, just as delightful as the dragon series. I have read each of her books in a 24 hour period because I cannot put them down."
3,3.5 stars,"Paen Scott is a Morovian Dark One, a vampire without a soul, unlike his brothers who are souled vampires. That does not trouble him overly much. What does is the fact that a demon lord is demanding that he find a monkey statue that his father promised the demon long ago. If Paen fails, he will lose his mother's soul. He turns to half - elf Samantha Crosse, a paranormal investigator to help locate the thing, never suspecting she is his Beloved. He doesn't even want a Beloved, but now he has one, and she will sacrifice everything to help and save him.*** Like all of Ms. MacAllister's books, this is a delightful charmer. Her vivid imagination is revealed throughout, as she reinvents the vampire myth and concocts killer butterflies. You won't be disappointed with one of her books, ever. ***"
2,"Dull, but so what?","Profoundly dull, yet, I still find the actress and her films interesting. My attitude before and after seeing ""The Look"" is that, if she has chosen to act in a particular film, I am curious to see it. I don't intend to watch ""The Look"" again, however, I might, to see if I missed anything. One conclusion I've reached after watching this movie is that actor's lives are no more interesting than anyone else's."
1,Charlotte's infomercial.,"Overly long, talky, boring exercise in Charlotte's love of herself. She's talks like she had this GREAT career. I mean, it was okay , but she's not Meryl Streep or Vanessa Redgrave. Watch Charlotte tell us about how great and fascinating she is. Yaaawwwwnnnn. Don't bother."
2,Tedious,"Tedious, and terribly, terribly banal -- despite everyone on screen believing themselves deep and profound. At least rent rather than buy. You'll most likely never care to watch again."
5,Gotta love the Japanese!!,"This is a Japanese EP released in 1988.It contains the following tracks:1) Here I Go Again (radio remix)2) Standing in the Shadows (87 remix)3) Looking for Love4) You're Gonna Break My Heart Again5) Need Your Love So Bad (87 remix)The only track here that has not been released elsewhere is ""Standing in the Shadows"". Nice version with John Sykes! The rest have been on greatest hits releases. ""Need Your Love So Bad"" shows why David Coverdale is one of the best singers ever. Along with English and Japanese lyrics it also contains a Whitesnake family tree up to 1987 (like the Kevin Bacon game, it seems any band can be linked to Deep Purple, try it!). Recommended for die hard Whitesnake fans like me."
1,To cheap,"I purchased this product in the hope that sometimes cheap stuff is actually ok. But not in this case. It can't be straight when the picture is in, it's hard to get a good straight look out of it on the wall. The Plexiglas is simply to thin.Don't bother wasting your money on it like I did."
1,"Cheap, flimsy product with excessive shipping cost","Cheap, flimsy product with excessive shipping cost...I used one click shopping which means I didn't know shipping costs up front...I won't do that again. SHIPPING WAS MORE THAN THE COST OF THE RUBBISH I BOUGHT. $50 FOR TWO USELESS FRAMES."
1,Garbage,"I didn't want to spend a lot on a frame so I chose this one. After shipping it was about $25 anyway though and it is complete garbage. Doesn't stay together, very flimsy. Would not recommend."
4,Interesting,"This is the first book of its kind that I've ever read (specific ceremonies throughout the life of the Ojibway), so I don't really have a point of reference. But I thought it was a great idea how it was written almost like a novel, in that the life of an individual was followed from birth, and all the ceremonies and events described throughout his life. It didn't have the emotion that a novel has, though, and does pretty much stick to describing circumstances, rather than understanding the people from the level of the heart. It is well written, and an enjoyable read. It left me wanting to read something more in-depth on the subjects."
3,iffy,"I bought this scanner to archive digitally all my slides and 35 mm film.The quality is grainy. Maybe I have a problem with the settings, but with the 48 bit depth, I expected better."
2,Epson Perfection 350 Photo Scanner,"The scanner works reasonably well, although the on-line instructions are not good, and some of illustrations in the poster do not match those on-line.My objection is that the light will not turn off following Epson's instructions to depress the PDF and adjacent scan buttons at the same time.Epson's technical support told me this was a hardware malfunction but the second scanner Amazon sent out had the same problem.If any other user can suggest a solution, I'd appreciate knowing it. Epson's technical support person was useless."
3,Leave Me Alone,"Writing a review is OPTIONAL. If I don't have the time and I pass up on the review, Amazon has no business sending me not one but two more emails to review the product. The scanner works just fine by the way. But your treatment makes me not want to order again very soon."
3,Limited Scanning Capabilities,"I recently purchased the Epson V350 scanner mostly to scan old 35mm negative film strips and 4x3 and larger photo negatives. Some of my rolls of negatives have 36 exposures making the automatic scanner unusable since it will only scan up to 6 photo negative segments.(My rolls of film are historic in nature and I will not cut them into 6 exposure segments) It also will not scan the entire photo negatives larger then 4x3 on the flatbed. Other then that, it seems to be a great scanner. The scanner is something that will work for my needs."
5,Epson V350 Scanner,"Excellent scanner....does everything most people except for the high volume professional might need. You can scan your negatives, color slides, photo of all shapes and sizes. Couplke with a good photo editing program and you have the makings of a mini photo editing lab.I highly nrecommend this product nthat has a large qty of prints or slides that needs to be archived. I scanned over 1000 photo's and slides without a single hitch. In addition to photo's it works great on documents and also avoids the opportunity to edit once scanned.AAAAAAAAAA+++++Brad Anderson"
1,IcyHot,This is the worst book I have read in a long time. I bought it 3 weeks ago and have yet to finish it. Do not waste your money.
4,Nice Flick,"This is an enjoyable film about the life and partnership of Alfred Lion and Francis Wolff of Blue Note records. Blue Note is my favorite jazz label and their story is heart warming. They deeply loved jazz --especially the bluesier stuff and they loved and respected the musicians. Many Blue Note artists appear in this ninty or so minute film along with the great music from this label. The only shortcomming is the lack of extended performances of some of the artists, but I guess then it would have been five hours long :-)"
2,"History, not music!","I made the mistake, from looking at the list of participating musicians, of thinking that this album consists of musical performances from the Blue Note collection. Not! The musicians are mostly talking [repeat, talking] about the founders of the Blue Note label--fine folks, I'm sure, but not what I was interested in."
3,A Comprehensive Report,"""The Neglected War"" is a unique book that offers an extraordinary look at Germany's South Pacific colonies that no other writer has attempted before. The author gives in-depth perspective of German colonization from 1885 to 1919 by the indigenous population, the Europeans, and Australians. He also goes into detail about the political and economic superstructure the Germans utilized to maintain their hegemony over the primarily colonial backwater that consisted of many, tiny islands. While the book is well-written and has excellent portions describing the military, political, and economic structure of the Germans in the region and how it was altered after the war, there are parts that drag and include unnecessary, preachy passages. Overall, I liked this book and found it very informative."
2,Useful but noisey,"I like that this product has a place to hold laundry-related items and the four-pronged holder is more secure than others that have just two prongs. However, the hook over the door must me made for giant doors much larger than my standard interior doors (home was constructed in 2007). Everytime I open or close the door the hanger and ironing board move and slams against the door. I tried putting felt pads on it to cushion the movement and sound but it didn't help much. I should have paid more attention to the measurements, which indicate 4.5"" depth, while my doors are closer to 2 inches thick."
3,"Sturdy, but may not work with all ironing boards or irons","I bought this one since it was one of the few that can hold up a ironing board, iron, plus bottles of starch, etc. It is sturdy but the over the door brackets were pretty wide and I had to bend them to fit the door. Also, my legs on my ironing board come down like a Y instead of a T so it doesn't sit perfectly on the holder. Last complaint is the top rack is to small to fit an iron up there and it has to be at an angle to stay up there. All in all in gets the job done but doesn't look perfect."
4,We love Lauren Child,"My daughter loves Lauren Child books. I thought this one was a bit long for my 4 year old, but she really likes reading it and she listens the whole way through. It is not my absolute favorite Lauren Child book, but I still gave it 4 stars because it is a good story with a good moral at the end."
2,Disrespectful of parents,"This was a humorous book. However, it made the parents look like idiots. Children need to be taught to respect their parents."
4,Against All Authority - 'All Fall Down' (Hopeless Records),"Good long-running spa-punk - that I believe they're still together. As I know I saw them in some dive awhile back as support band for G.B.H. Tunes here I found to my liking were ""Justification"", the jumping ""At Our Expense"", ""Stand In Line"", the ass-kicking ""We Don't Need You"", ""The Mayhem & The Pain"" and ""When The Rain Begins To Fall"". Not exactly my cup of tea - but as I've mentioned it before, I can certainly appreciate good ska or even good ska-punk, as such. Line-up: Danny Lore - bass & vocals, Joe Koontz - guitar, Jeremy Kaiser - trumpet, Tim Coats - saxophone and Kris King - drums. Should appeal to fans of Mustard Plug, Smash Mouth, Reel Big Fish and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones."
2,Not As good as destroy what destroys you.,"Agaisnt all authority is a great band. This album they put out though, could have been a lot better than it is. The first four songs are great, with all fall down being incredible, but the rest of the album sounds almost the same. They need to mix things up a little more, and get some different sounding horn riffs. If you are a huge -AAA- fan go ahead and buy it, but if not i'd stick with their earlier album, or just keep listening to Op Ivy, or Link 80."
5,Great book,"Bought this on remainder a few years ago and picked it up a couple of days ago. It's terrific. Takes you right inside the LA D.A.'s office and quickly becomes a page turner. Better in many ways than John Grisham, etc., . . . plus it's a true story."
4,Almost as perfect as John Paul was!,"This is a remarkable remembrance of an extraordinary life! I thought there should have been more about the video clips - who, where, when, etc. Detailed identifications were skimpy. Perhaps all that is in the 5-DVD collection from the Vatican, but this DVD certainly sparks interest in learning more from whatever sources. A wonderful addition to the library of anyone who loved this man - no matter your nationality or religion!"
4,Attractive and durable tool storage - check pricing though,This is an attractive pegboard and seems to be strong. I do not intend to hang more than 100lbs from it because I am only using it for hand tool and cordless drill storage. Because of the mounting flange arrangement (it is not a flat sheet but has a rolled over lip on all sides) of this product I could not just use traditional pegboard mounting materials from Crawford (e.g. 14994) but had to improvise using washers to bring the nylon Crawford spacers flush to the wall. I would note also that the Crawford pegboard accessories mounting posts (e.g. Crawford PB-1 and PBTH) seemed too small for these pegboard holes and I had to use cable ties to secure them properly. The board comes wrapped in a protective sheet which protects against marring of the finish during installation. I paid less than $200 for my pegboard and that is the price point at which I could recommend this product.
4,Good family fun,"This was a good purchase for my young granddaughter. The older children and parents play with her, so it is a good way to get the toddlers involved in family fun."
5,Best Game Ever,Gave this lil game to my 5 yr old niece for Christmas and she just loves playing it and really impressed that it was invented by a kid just about her age!!! It goes to show every kid that they can accomplish anything they put their minds to!!!
4,Great Game for 3 Year old,"I bought this game for my daughter who is 3 years old. She is learning how to count and learning about sharing and taking turns. We try to minimize TV time by playing fun games at least every other night if we can. This is a fun game for her, easy, quick to learn and quick to play. It's not long and drawn out, it's perfect for the attention span 3 year olds have! It's also really cute with the lady bugs.You get a game board and the game pieces are cardboard and the lady bugs sit in little plastic stands. The each have names that go along with their color (i.e., Olivia Orange). There are two seperate sets of large cards that come with the game. You take a card in this game instead of rolling dice. Instructions are simple and the game is very straightforward. I'm sure we'll be enjoying it for a few years to come."
2,Not so hot for this three year old.,"Got this game for a girl who just turned three and it was too difficult for her. Her five year old sister did OK with it and seemed to enjoy it though. It' a typical board game, move a long, collect cards etc. Don't really get what the copy is about; become part of the bugs life etc."
5,Grandsons gift.,"It was a game he asked for. He is being home schooled so his mother said it was helpful, It is a fun game,"
5,The best 8 dollars I've ever spent!,"I got this game on sale at Target about 6 months ago and I've lost count of how many times we've played it. My son is 4 1/2 and my daughter just turned 3 and they both love it. As a result of playing this, they both count, add and subtract very well. It's great for taking turns and enduring setbacks. Both of my children love playing games and we have a lot of them but my 4 year old asks me to play this with him at least once a day and often will even play it by himself, moving two ladybugs. My nephew said they played it in Kindergarten and he's now in 2nd grade and still loves it. I highly recommend this one!"
4,mover,My 3 year old granddaughter loves playing this game. She is learning how to take turns and how to be a good winner or loser.
3,Not terrible for a kid game,"I played this with my nieces, ages 3 and 4, over the holidays. It isn't a bad game, and it eventually does end. The number of go backs and repeats gets old and kind of hard for them to follow. It might work better for slightly older children."
1,"BORING. Better of getting Candyland, Chutes-n-Ladders, etc...","My 2-1/2-year-old girl played this twice and never got it down off of the shelf again. I had high hopes for this game, and I do admit that it is very simple and very cute, but nothing of interest happens, no giggle-inducing play here. I've tried several times recently (she now almost 3-1/2) to generate interest in this game again, to no avail. She just finds it boring. Players traverse along a path, collect aphids, maybe go back a few spaces, and make it to the end. There are so many games that far surpass this one."
1,Too complex for younger players,"I am surprised that this game has an average of 4 stars! Perhaps for an older child (like the SIX YEAR OLD who DESIGNED it!) this game might be appropriate, but certainly not for a 3-year old! There are simply too many things going on (collecting cards/giving back the card, going back to start if you don't have the card, collecting chips/giving back the chips, getting caught in a seemingly endless loop if you don't have enough chips, moving foward, moving backward, etc, etc). This game was torture for me to play. Even my kids got bored/frustrated VERY quickly. We've had it for almost a year, and have only played it MAYBE a handful of times. The last time, my four-year old seemed to enjoy it a bit more, but my 3-year old still can't sit through it. There are MANY other better games out there... don't waste your time or money on this one!"
2,Just not that fun,"This game looks cute, but my 5 year old was bored by it and was confused by the directions. Actually, I was too. Just not interested enough in it to figure it out. Eventually gave it away."
2,there are better games for 3-yr olds.,"My almost 4-year old loves to play this game, but I hate it. It's too complicated for her age and I don't get how kids can play without reading. I had to thoroughly explain the game to my 6 and 8-year old nieces, and once they finally played they didn't even have fun. It's educational because you count a lot, and that's why my daughter likes it, but the concept just doesn't make a lot of sense. Bottom line, there are better games. I recommend Toy Story Yahtzee or the classic Candy Land."
3,Fun game but could use some improvement.,"My boys LOVE this game. They are 6 1/2 and 4. It's entertaining, educational (they have to read cards, count spaces and count the aphids), and fun. My two complaints are (and I realized its created by a 1st grader BUT shouldve gone through a little review...) it drags on really long and because of that we ened up having to shuffle cards like THREE times during game play. It needs more cards or needs to move quicker."
2,Boring Game,"At the beginning of the game, this seemed like a good activity for my 3 year old. She was able to follow the simple instructions on the cards and play somewhat independently. But then we got stuck in a loop on the game and the game progressed for over 45 minutes. During this time my daughter completely lost interest and my husband and I quickly became tired of the game. She got several wonderful games for Christmas and I doubt we will play this one again."
4,Great for young kids,"If you are 2-7 you will love this game. The kids love it and want to play it all the time. The good thing is like Glenn Beck says, ""it does end"". They count and collect and you never know who could win. Your 3 year-old may beat you!"
4,Great way of learning to count and read,I have two boys 3 years and 5 years old. The older one really got into the game and can play well from start to finish. The characters have funny names and the board is very colorful - my kids like it more than Candy Lane. My little one comes up with his own rules for the game and there are enough cards and bugs to make it fun for him too.
4,My kids really like this game,"My kids are 3 and 4. We play this game about 3 or 4 times a week. My kids really enjoy it. They like looking at and ask questions about bugs. It also helps with counting, waiting turns, and about winning and losing. It's not really a super educational toy but it's fun to play wih toddlers."
5,Ladybug game,My granddaughter loves this game. She is 3 1/2 yrs. old. It is perfect for her. I am very pleased.
1,Pass.,"We received this game as a gift, and my 4-year-old daughter was excited to play it (she has the Grumpy Ladybug game, and this is pretty much in that vein). This game is sheer torture for the parents that have to play it. There is no educational value in this game (unless your child is learning to recognize numbers 1-6). The game can get tedious as mentioned in other reviews, so the ""saving grace"" in most childrens' game, i.e. that they play fast, this one doesn't even have. There are tons of other games in this age-range that are far, far superior."
2,what a bore..,"I really like the box, the bright colors, and that it seems like a sturdy enough game (unlike some of the really cheaply made games out there). But beyond that, this game isn't even worth the space that it takes up on the game shelf. I have a 2.5 year old and a 6.5 year old. We have played this game maybe three times. Each game seems to go on for what feels like forever. It's just a dull dull game. It's a cute concept, good quality, but just so boring. I think I'll let my 7 year old write her own rules for the game. Maybe she can come up with something a little more exciting. We'll see :)"
4,we love it,"My daughter received this game for Christmas when she was 3.5 years old. She loves it, and it actually holds her attention. We tried Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders in the past, but she never would sit through a whole game. The ladybug cards are great because she knows what she needs to do even though she can't read the words. Counting out the aphid cards help her reinforce counting, adding, and subtracting."
4,The Ladybug Game,"What a fun game! I purchased it for my 3 year-old granddaughter and we played it Christmas morning. With her other gifts sitting around her, she wanted to learn how to play the game. Although we finished, and she won!, I think when she is a bit older, it will be easier for her to maintain the concentration needed to play."
3,A little boring,"My grand children (1st grade and kindergarden) had a hard time playing it thru. They commented it was boring! Other than that, the game itself was made well and hade vibrant colors. The price was okay."
1,One minute monologues followed by guest introductions,"If you're looking for some humorous political commentary, you won't find it here. The audio book consists of a series of one minute monologues in which Maher lays out the topics to be discussed on the show, followed by the guest introductions. There aren't any clips of the guests or Maher actually discussing those topics. Frankly there is nothing humorous or entertaining about listening to a series of topics and guest introductions. It's a waste of time and money."
3,This book doesn't deliver what the cover promises.,"Proving yet again that you can't judge a book by its cover, this one promises ""easy decorative stitching using ANY sewing machine."" However, the examples on the cover required programmed stitches...which I don't have on my machine...which is why I ordered this book in the first place. The book seems to provide a well-organized, clear, and thorough explanation of the more pictorial types of machine embroidery, but I was hoping for some ideas about how to do the decorative stitches on the cover on my beloved but very basic machine."
3,Teach Yourself machine Embroidery: Easy Decorative Stitching,"Delivery was slow, however, the book was in excellent condition."
4,soft material,My wristbands uaually get very hard after few washings! The material of this one seems to be soft when compared to others I have!
1,"""creative"" versions of our anthems","Sounds like it would be a great collection especially for those of us who teach elementary school. These songs are all ""personalized"" so they're not what you typically hear. The music and voices are very good but not for introducing and teaching kids our patriotic songs."
1,Eeww!,"This is like the music to one of those theme park Celebrate America type shows. The musical arrangements have that hokey, somewhat dated, overly sweet and enthusiatic feel I hate. I thought I was getting the standard versions of these songs but what I got was the cruise ship extravaganza, yuck!"
1,somebody open the trash can lid,i HATE this collection of boring sterotypical american songs. ive never been much of a patriot. this album has terrible songs like all those songs people like to put there hand over their heart while playing. yuck me and my family will pass on this one. i recomend you do the same.
2,Not the *best* U2 book..,"Being a huge U2 fan, I read everything about them that I can get my hands on, but I gotta say I was kind of disappointed with this particular U2 book. It's mainly a collection of interview sound-bytes taken from other sources. If you want an awesome U2 book, go read U2 At the End of the World by Bill Flanagan. The Road to Pop is more of a general U2 history book, and lacks any kind of ""insider"" feel. If you follow the band at all, none of the stuff in this book will be news to you."
2,I really wanted to like it,"I'm sorry but I did try to conect with this book and I couldn't. I found myself bored and skipping through the pages. I didn't find the book structure, it seemed to go all over the place from one theme to another and then backwords.I should add that English is not my mother tongue. I'm used to reading books in English, but this one was a struggle."
3,Syndicate Of Sound - 'Little Girl' (Sundazed) 3 1/2 stars,"Can't believe that no one else has ever bothered to review this CD reissue. Also didn't know this short-lived band had just one actual lp out. Total of sixteen tracks, likely that it's probably Syndicate Of Sound's entire repertoire or at least close to it. Originally put out in 1966, as most of you might remember the snappy two-and-a-half minute ditty ""Little Girl"", apparently their sole hit. Other happening cuts here include ""I'm Alive"", ""Dream Baby"", ""Lookin' For The Good Times"", the should've-been-a-hit ""Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?"" and ""Upper Hand"". Basically, just good garage rock & roll. Line-up: Don Baskin - guitar & vocalist, Jim Sawyer - guitar, John Sharkley - guitarist & keyboardist, Bob Gonzalez - bass and John Duckworth - drums. Should appeal to fans of Music Machine, The Seeds,Count Five, Standells and The Leaves."
4,Bay Area Band,"This group was from San Jose, Calif. And yes, there big hit was Little Girl. They had a minor hit Mary which was only released on a 45 but is now included in this album for the 1st time. GREAT oldies Band."
2,Two-hit Wonders,"I bought this album as a teen in the 60s, got rid of it by decade's end, but recently purchased the expanded CD on the strength of the terrific ""Rumors"" on the new ""Love Is the Song We Sing"" box set. But my teen self was right: aside from ""Rumors"" and the sassy ""Little Girl,"" the CD consists mostly of weak covers and derivitive originals. (Even ""Rumors"" nicks its chorus from Donovan's ""The Trip."") The SoS could play in a variety of musical styles, but that doesn't make up for the overall blandness."
3,eh,"These sorta work sorta don't if you bleed a lot you still have to wear a liner, then what's the point? They do become comfortable though after you get used to putting them in. Just remember be gentle when you pull them out"
1,Awful Quality VHS Tape,The version of the Treasure Seekers I got was a rip off. The picture quality was poor and most irritating was a horizontal line that waved through the picture very 10 seconds or so. I'd like my money back.
3,"Why, Gregory, why?","For an actor of Gregory Peck's caliber this movie was just, well, blah. Not even that beautiful and enthralling voice of his could make it come to life.Throughout I kept picking up the jacket, searching out Alfred Hitchcock's name, just to make sure I hadn't mistaken it for his movie when it wasn't. There was no tension, no mystery, no thrill. But instead, as another reviewer had mentioned, it was almost outright silly. There is no way, realistically, that Peck's character would have become so smitten with his, in my opinion, not so attractive client in so short a time. Yes, I know, we are suppose to suspend some belief in these things, but c'mon. This is asking a bit much. Not even the beautiful lines on Peck's face and the way they deepen when he talks could save me from the boredom of this movie. Now, if you want a clever courtroom drama film, watch Witness for the Prosecution."
3,Tall Blondes: A book About Giraffes,Item was shipped in a timely manner. Seller is quick to respond to emails and questions. Will take the time to insure you are happy with the product sent.
4,Mind-blowing Victorian erotica...,"I enjoyed this erotic account of a rich, aristocratic man's sexual adventures. The unnamed male character regales us with his insatiable stories that begin when he was at a rather young age and continue throughout his life. The author's descriptions of France give a more picturesque feel to this erotic story. This is a very well written Victorian novel that enthralled me from beginning to end. I cannot elaborate on the plot more, for it is simply about a wealthy man's sexual escapades -- suffice it to say that this is an amazing, erotic read by an anonymous, albeit very imaginative author."
3,Just ok nothing special!,"I guess for me there was just too much about this guy in his very young days - I really don't find to much erotic hearing about ages 8 through 14 - as the story got further along it got a little better but it would never be on my top erotic reads - just not hot enough, sexy enough or sultry enough!!"
2,Mostly Boring,"I was disappointed in this book. The last part, when he was with Edyth, was the best, but, overall, the book was a let down. Having read ""Eveline"", by far the best erotic novel that I have read, I`m afraid that everything else is downhill. (However, I will keep trying)"
5,"Superior quality, great style and price!","Just received my first pair of these sandals and was so impressed I ordered a second in another color. The pair I have now is bronze, which is just the right touch of metallic - stylish and trendy but not too flashy. I also like the subtle tiger print insole although it looks like this will be more pronounced in the black. But what stands out is the quality of the shoe. Very well made with supple leather, quality stitching and sturdy wedge heel. I bought these as a step up from flats and the 2"" wedge height is perfect - dressier than traditional thongs but still incredibly comfortable. They seem to run true to size so feel confident ordering your normal size. I highly recommend these - a designer shoe at a Target price!"
3,Intriguing but not a light read,"Because Amazon has made it sooo easy to download the classics, I am going through some of D. H. Lawrence. I LOVED Sons and Lovers and am familiar with Lady Chatterley so decided to try this one. It is hard to know how to rate it. The characters are endlessly philosophizing in long monlologues and that can get tedious. And, of course, I find their viewpoints quite different from how we would approach the questions regarding the meaning of life today. Yet the characters themselves bind you so that it is hard to put down. Lawrence must have been working out some very heavy personal issues when he wrote this! I'm glad I read it and am curious to see how it fits into the rest of Lawrence's work. This makes me hungry.Thanks, Amazon, for making these classics available for FREE! I've no excuses now not to read all the things I meant to. If only life didn't get in the way!"
2,Slow or leisurely,Women in Love is somewhat mistitled. It explores (at length) relationships and the dawning knowledge among the men and women of their same-sex attraction. I found the book slow - others may say leisurely - in it's pace. This leisurely pace and the detailed passages combined to produce a dated book for this reader.
1,"Don't bother. Read Lady Chatterley's Lover, instead","All of the characters were odious. I found it really hard to actually finish this book. The pomposity of the writing was too much. The whole book was very off-putting. I don't know if the author actually wanted you to like any of the characters, but I didn't. And the only reason I finished this book is so that I can continue towards my goal for this year. I'm glad I've read other works by Lawrence or this book would have turned me off of him forever."
4,"Nice time capsule, lots of music here as well......","This CD unfolds as a bit of a time capsule in reverse, as the earlier traditional rock and roll songs such as ""I Put a Spell On You"" and ""Mickey's Monkey"" appear after the C. A. Quintet's journey into psych. Great to hear a band like this which made the transition successfully. Nice performances appear in both genres, for example, the vesrion of ""Mickey's Monkey"" is quite a good one. A unique touch is the trumpet playing. In the psych tunes, it's sort of like Herb Alpert meets the Dead; in the rock'n'roll, they sometimes remind me of the Buckinghams. Also the radio advertisement for the C. A. Quintet and another favorite band of mine, the Stillroven, adds a nice bit of nostalgia. The advance tickets were SOLD OUT, they advise. No surprise. And the number and length of the selections gives us a lot of music for our bucks."
3,A watch is only as good as its band....,"The watch is nice. Small and compact, short profile (ie. height) on the wrist, no side pushbuttons to accidentally activate. I also like that you see the date, day, time and am/pm without having to push a button. However, the band is very inadequate. It is barely long enough to span my average-sized wrist. It's also very narrow and digs into the flesh. I will keep but by the time I replace the band, I will likely have exceeded the price of the watch."
3,My third one. Does the job.,"Gives accurate time, date, day and month for a low price. Battery lasts 4 or 5 years at least. Occasionally may have to replace wrist band. So why only 3 stars?Because it's annoying to change the time and other info when necessary. But, unless you move or travel a lot, you'll only do that twice a year, if that."
2,Disappointing.,"I am very disappointed in this watch. The Amazon description specifically says:""Mens, 1/100 second stopwatch, countdown timer, measuring unit: 1/10 second, Daily alarm, Hourly time signal, Auto-calendar.""This watch does not have a stopwatch.This watch does not have a timer.This watch does not count 1/10 of a second.This watch does not have a daily alarm.This watch does not have an hourly time signal.This watch does not have an auto-calendar.There are only two buttons. One for selecting things to change and one for changing things.Here's what it does have: day of the week, month, date, hour, minute, seconds, am/pm. That's it. No more, no less. It doesn't even have a light. It is only ""water resist"" without any depth, which means splashes are okay, but not car-washing, swimming, or showering.I miss my #W71-1V that Amazon no longer carries."
5,Men's Casio Digital Watch F28W-1,"This watch has been around for many years, and maybe there is good reason for that. It's no nonsense watch, with the basics shown on the face. The last one of these, I had for about ten years before the lithium battery finally died. The plastic straps wear out in a year or two, so what I do with a new one, is to remove the straps and glue the watch on my metal money clip. That makes it a pocket watch, which will last for years. I would recommend this watch to anyone who wants a very accurate, long lived time piece.Richard Talada"
5,"Casio Classic Digital Watch, F28W-1",Just like the past and present Casio watches I own... GREAT WATCH at a GREAT PRICE... so GREAT DEAL... How do you beat that?
2,watchband not adequate; returned,The watch was OK but the band was not wide enough -- more like a child's or girls band. Returned it and went to shopping center to get the right band. I already had an identical watch with a GOOD band that had broken.
4,I got more than what I paid for. Great value,Since its a CASIO you can trust that it will keep time accurately. Its definately not a great watch in fact if you disregard the price its probably in the bottom 20%. Considering the price I got it for I'd say its in Top 10%. GREAT VALUE. Only regret is that there is no light.
4,"Inaccurate Description; Basic, Reliable.","I have to start by saying the description is inaccurate. There is NO stopwatch, NO alarm, NO hourly chime, and NO 1/10 second display. Bearing that in mind, this is a very simple watch. It shows the day of the week, the date, and the time. There are two buttons, set and select. I would've returned this watch, but I would have had to pay shipping back and a fee to return it. It's not bad for the price, though. Really."
5,Basic Digital Time,"No Frills, Alarms, Lights or Special Waterproofing, just a simple digital watch that keeps time. It is perfect for work and catching the bus. The battery will eventually run down but nothing is perfect. This exactly what I wanted at the price I liked."
2,Inaccurately advertised,"I specifically bought this watch for the countdown timer, which either it does not have or simply neglects to mention in the instructions. Either way, the watch sits unused on a shelf because I don't need a watch (I use my cell phone for that), I need a timer. I would return it but the return shipping makes the entire endeavor sort of fruitless."
5,Great Quality!,"This was my first purchase from Old Glory and I would reccomend them as a top seller. The hoodie was exactly as described and their quick service was as promised. I received it promptly, enabling me to have my gift in time for the occasion. Thanks to both Old Glory and to Amazon.com for great service!"
1,Beware,"The picture shows that the product is ""tangy taffy"" when in fact it is NOT. It was nothing more than ""laffy taffy"" which I could have bought for about a third of the price from any candy store in the United States. With shipping and handling, 14 pieces of candy cost me almost $30. Total product misrepresentation as far as I'm concerned. I won't order again."
4,Entertaining and suspenseful,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. There were a lot of different twists and turns in it to keep me guessing throughout. I do agree with the previous reviewer about the spelling and grammatical errors. There were quite a few of them. I haven't seen that many errors in a book in a long time. For that reason it gets four out of five stars from me. However, it was still a very entertaining book to read."
2,Painful,"This book blew my mind in its ability to be bad. This is not a thriller or a suspense novel, it is a melodrama, a soap opera. Sure there are endless murders and bad guys who can be everywhere at all times and characters who just happen to always ""sense"" somebody there and enough use of deus ex machina to make you puke. Everytime a character is in trouble a branch falls, a wave comes, a bump in the road. Jeesh already. And alas, there is no mystery here...O'Brien forecasts everything in a narrative that could easily have been 100 pages less. I relented and gave it two stars over one because he can at least write decent prose, if a little too hung up on colloquialisms (ye gods)."
4,good mystery,"I was looking for another author similar to Greg Olsen. Tried this based on other readers' picks. Story pulled me in immediately, and will order other books by same author."
3,"Not Too Good, Not That Bad!",Certainly not one of O'Brien's better books. I thought he followed the same theme as The Next to Die. Another righteous group out to dispose of undesirables. Of course the almost separate serial killer plot is what kept me reading. I am liking Kevin's books a little less with each one I read. Too bad.
4,Another great Kevin OBrien novel,"I LOVE Kevin OBrien novels, this one is no exception. He keeps you trying to figure out the finish with every chapter. I guess my love for mysteries comes from working as a police dispatcher for 21 years. Try a OBrien book if you enjoy serial killers and you won't be disappointed in any of his books from a Amazon Verified purchase."
2,left for bored,"Having read books by Lee Child and John Conolly, I found this offering just a little too predictable and less than exciting.The interchange between a couple of the characters, who were supposed to be a police team was so absolutely unbelievable it actually detracted from the book's authenticity.The author seemed guilty of overstuffing and appeared to be trying to make the book reach the required length of a novel by hedging and stalling.Finally there just wasn't any believable suspense. One could lose interest in the main character long before any resolution. Just not exciting"
3,x-fi console,The unit is too large and cumbersome. I will not use it often--only to x-fer LPs to MP33.
1,Don't buy - The clip breaks,"This is a great holster except for one crucial flaw and that is the clip. My first holster lasted 5 months, before the clip broke when I sat down on a coach and it got caught on the armrest. Second holster lasted 2 months and 1 week when the clip broke when I sat down in the car and it pushed up against the seatbelt clip.Unless you take the blackberry off every time you sit, I believe these will keep on breaking. Since the company pays for these I will keep on ordering them and update this review as future holsters prove their worth."
1,"Great holster, but the clip breaks easily","As booswig pointed out a couple of months ago, while the holster is great, with a nice magnetic latch (much nicer than velcro, especially in meetings!), the clip is it's Achilles heel: it breaks much too easily. I have now broken two: the first after 3 months, when it got caught on the arm of a chair, and the second just a couple of days ago sitting in a car. I heard and felt the first one snap; the second one seemed more simply that the plastic just failed."
1,Blackberry curve leather case,The leather case is really tight. Very hard to slide the curve in and out. Have to use two hands. Also it keep hitting the buttons when you are sliding it in and out. Not a good design. I would recommend buying another case.
1,Poor quality hardware,"I bought two of these. The first lasted a month before the clip came away from the holster, the second lasted two days before the clip itself fell apart. Lousy quality."
3,Very Supportive,Excellant case if I clip it on my pants pockets. But I have love handles so that's why I don't clip it on my belt. It become painful pressing up against my love handles.
4,Nice carry method,"This is a pretty good carrying case and has the magnet for the holstering function on the BB. The top of the clip does jab a bit into my side when sitting down like another reviewer mentioned. It's an incentive to stay trim, but seems like it could be designed differently.It does have a nice, strong spring so it stays in place, although it does beat up my belts after a while. The grip part of the clip is pretty pointy at corners. Since it keeps the phone from falling, I'm ok with it.I wish it were smaller. The Curve is not much bigger than a Razr to the point where it almost fits my side mount Razr case. That case is about the same size in terms of length and width, but since the clip is smaller, the whole thing is much narrower. And the clip doesn't extend beyond the sides of the case as this one does."
4,It's OK.,"I wanted this because my dad had one for his 8800, but I like using the case that came with my Curve better anyway."
3,Not Indestructible,"An attractive, classy looking holster. Unfortunately, not indestructible.The clip is attached with two rivets which are fairly easy to pull out of the soft lambs skin case."
5,Great Case!,"My biggest concern with this case was that it would widen the Curve. I bought the phone for its small stature and didn't want the case to ruin it. It is both a nice looking case and not a terribly thick case. The best part is the proximity sensor that kicks the BlackBerry into vibrate mode, etc. It is worth it to get an official BlackBerry Case. Selecting other brands would cause you to loose out on a very useful feature."
1,Fake,"I don't know a Prada from a Piranha, but my girlfriend certainly does. I bought this bag for her as a surprise present, and although she appreciated the gesture, she has informed me this bag is most certainly not a Prada. What a waste of money."
1,Don't be mistaken...,"The product that is sometimes shown in the picture is not what you get. This is not the same product it used to be, though the product number is the same. It used to have the letters, on 1/3 cut tabs down both sides. Now the product comes with the letters staggered down the entire file. I had to return mine because they showed the old picture when I ordered. It is disappointing that they changed this product. Our builders preferred the old folders to these new ones."
2,"Fits most, but not mine...","I bought this rack at a local bike shop for my Specialized Hardrock, and needless to say, one size may fit all, but it doesn't on my bike. The Hardrock's rear fork sticks out because of reinforcement welding, and after jimmying with this rack for half an hour I managed to strip out the screw holes on my aluminum frame!I doubt a return is possible, so it looks like I'll be breaking out the big tools to bend this thing into the proper shape.Maybe a seat-mounted rear rack would have been the way to go, but the Hardrock also has an especially thick seat neck too."
4,the ideal tool anyone with a collection of slides must have in his tool box!,"there is no better way to copy slides in an affordable way but making sure that you maintain quality and usability. You are copying ur slides at the full resolution potential of your dslr. I recommend this to anyone, just do some research to make sure the focal length will work with your lens.It takes a lot of extensions... iv got loads of up and down c rings that i put together to make sure it focused accurately...if you can work round those problems, u will be blown away!"
2,It could have been so much more...,"I collect and read every bead book available, and had high hopes for this title. Sadly, the projects are for beginners at best, and contain little or no information that cannot be obtained for free on most beading-related web sites. No new ideas in this book, and I wouldn't even recommend it to a beginning beader."
3,Didn't realize it was VHS,"I don't know about the quality of the product, but I ordered it for my sister in law, not realizing it was VHS, and had to return it because she doesn't have a VHS player, neither do I, nor does the majority of the United States population. But the idea of the excersie program looks great and I will get another one if I find it in DVD."
2,Robert Parker the Judas Goat,Printed very poorly with missing pages and smeared print. The story is fine but the book is a last class printing job..
5,Best of Spenser,"The Spenser series is generally very good--with a few lapses.Occasionally Parker slips or becomes completely formulaic (for example, in the pitiful ""Double Deuce"").But this one, The Judas Goat, may be his best.All the snappy dialogue. All the crisp Hammett-Chandler sentences. All the Urban Western action. Even quite a lot of humor. And of course, the cross-continental settings.But best of all: VERY LITTLE of the Odious Susan Silverman."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Although this story is set in 1976, it has aged very well. This isn't really a mystery - more of an action thriller. There is not much mystery and no whodunit angle. That being said, the characters are interesting and enjoyable, the setting is fun to read about, and the internal dialogue is at times very funny. This is my second Spenser novel, and I'll look to read some more."
5,great gift for a young reader,Bought it for my 8 year old. he loves the series!Seller was fast in delivery and set was as if it was still new.Very satisfied :)
3,Quality-good,"The books were in great condition! However, the set indicated it was a box set and a box was not included as it appeared in the picture."
1,Only one sixth of order fullfilled,I bought the first six books in the series and the seller only sent one book--and not even the first one! What a disappointment!
1,The Hardy Boys Starter Kit,The seller did not send it but sent six other Hardy Boys books instead. Made no offer to send the starter kit. I just let it go.
2,"It's ok, not great",These look good but I'm not entirely happy with them. The male end doesn't fully seat into the speaker post - about half of it's sticking out. I can't tell if that's how deep my post is or if it's just so tight it won't go in any further. I think next time I'll go with a conventional looking banana plug.
3,Fun but not for serious research,This book is a collection of modernized recipes from the Martha Washington cookbook (that really wasn't written by Martha just in case you wanted to know). For the person who wants to have a colonial themed dinner or for a school theme function it is fine. For the real historian who wants to delve into period cooking please keep going. Hannah Glasse will be the right choice for you.
5,Marha Cook Book,"If you are a foodie and looking for a great gift, I recommend this. It will give you a look into the past!!!"
2,Big disappointment,"Considering the price of the book, I assumed it was in hardcover and didn't notice the price was for paperback. I could have determined that is was soft cover had I checked the details and noticed the weight. The book was shipped as super saver and I did not check the dimensions, etc. The greatest disappointment is the ""historical"" information and recipes. Historical information and number of recipes sorely lacking. I think the advertising could be considered slightly deceptive. I ordered the book and had it shipped as a Christmas gift. The recipient's response was gracious but will soon be receiving a replacement gift that will not appear shabby."
5,Great Cookbook,I am a cook and I collect cookbooks as a result. This one is very good with the added history.
5,Hitachi P42T501 Exceptional!,"I am very please with this purchase. The resolution of this set is great even for the non-HD channels on digital and especially the analog cable channels. I also purchased a HDMI v1.3 cable and the picture was even more stunning particularly on the Discovery HD Theater Channel. Although not full 1080P, I could hardly notice the difference when connected to my Toshiba HD-DVD 1080P player-the HD-DVD Movie ""DreamGirls"" looked great! This is a terrific set for those who watch regular HD Programming and want good analog resolution from cable channels at a reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!"
1,Sucky Product,"I bought this card for my XFX 8800gtx and couldn't handle it, i had to RMA and i bought a thermaltake 850w and was the best."
5,Medically accurate,As a well educated a nurse practitioner with pustular rosacea since pregnancy I have found this book to be my users guide. I refer back to it frequently as my rosacea has changed and resurfaced throughout the years. It's an ongoing process and never goes away completely but can be controlled by the techniques suggested in this book. Lengthy and medical but helpful. I just wish he'd get the online help site up and running. Products advised very useful
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"What a snore-fest. I was interested in learning some introductory philosophy. Since I've read part of this book, I'll just take wood shop."
1,This author is into himself..minimal public offering.,"If Baldner wasn't such a self serving egotist, the assumption that a subject was being presented may have played out. The author is truly impressed with himself."
2,"If you want to write a book about autism, stick to autism","Some interesting -but definitely not new- insights into autism, wrapped around a totally implausible mystery that was definitely not ""thrilling!"" I wish I hadn't wasted my precious reading time trying to finish this silliness."
4,Eye Contact,"I had never heard of this book or this author before, but stumbled upon the book at a bookstore in the bargain bin, and I'm really glad that I found it. The book was suspenseful the whole way through. I found myself wondering throughout the whole book if anyone was ever going to be able to get Adam, who is autistic, to tell what happened that day in the woods. I would definitely recommend this one to everyone."
2,Jangly,"I believe this author had a story to tell and it could have been an interesting one, however, the writing style, made me want to scream. It made my nerves jangle. Every page I would ask myself do I want to keep reading this and I would plow on. Finally, I said enough and didn't finish the book."
3,Surprisingly Boring & Unengaging,"I couldn't find a single character with whom I sympathized, empathized, or for whom I cared enough about to find this an interesting read. Although I do sympathize with any parent who has an autistic child, that doesn't mean that writing wbout this or reading about it will be a worthwhile experience. I wasn't even at page 100 when I just wanted it to be over because I lost interest and couldn't identify with a single man, woman or child. I didn't care who did what or why, and there was far too little suspense or mystery and too much emphasis placed on the details of autism and a parent who certainly didn't have her act together. Zzzzzz..."
3,Clever title for a story with many characters dealing with autism spectrum disorders but.....,The author is too ambitious in attempting to develop several different characters with neurological/emotional disorders. All the extra information concerning these characters and their conditions detract from the book's readability as a mystery/thriller. The mystery that is central to the story is very compelling at the beginning but loses momentum in the second half of the book due to too many subplots and all these characters and their wide array of problems. As a special educator I can say that McGovern's information about autism spectrum disorders is correct and I applaud her efforts to present characters dealing with these challenges sympathetically.
4,Very Interesting Read,"This book was rather good. I really enjoyed it, but I think having autistic children as two of the main characters made is what made it good. If it wasn't for this, I don't know if it would have been very interesting. Overall, it was worth reading."
2,So disappointed,"I had such high hopes for this book. The reviews seemed great but I did not find this book ""gripping"" and ""suspenseful"" at all. I was curious to see what would happen in the long run but it was very slow and dull. I gave it a while and then gave up."
3,3 stars for Adam,"I am not usually a mystery reader so not a good judge but this mystery was so-so to me. As another reader said, I too got confused with the different characters and who was doing what in the story.It seemed there were too many loosely defined characters and too many shallow subplots. I got more out of the parenting an autistic child part however overall I found the book very slow going. I give it 3 stars for the character of Adam and my hat is off to the author for being a mom and a writer. Alhtough I loved ""Adam"" this book did not effect me the way ""The Curious Incident...."" where I learned so much more about the spectrum of autism and felt like it should be required reading. In contrast I don't think Eye Contact will stick with me in quite the same way."
4,Very good but not great,"This book is very well written. It keeps you intrigued by the mystery of the crime. I sympathized with the mother but at the same time found her a little clueless and shall I say ""dumb"". I agree with the review that says by the end you are exhausted from the tangles of ""who did it"". However, I did like that book and I though that it flows well."
4,Specialty Italian Cheese for Frica dish,"A good-tasting, hard to find (retail) Italian Cheese, but expensive shipping charge makes it impossible for me to order again."
2,Okay if you can't afford anything else,"The product was okay if you can't afford anything else. You could the the ""leather"" was cheap. When you put it on and stood up, there were hard points under the soles of your feet. It felt as if you were standing on a pebble. I figured I would add another 25.00 dollars and buy boots from one of the stores that I know."
2,The heel broke,These are not made for everyday use or Iowa winters! They only lasted 2 months before the heel broke off the one.
1,Product Defect,"I ordered these boots in hopes to replace a pair of Rampage boots I purchased a few years ago. First, these weren't the exact boots but I was happy with them nonetheless. Then about my 3rd time wearing them I noticed both boots began to tear/rip down the front seems! I am very dissappointed because my past Rampage boots were great, I just wore out the soles."
1,Do not buy!!,Right heel broke off after only three wears. Wonder if I could get my money back?? Too good to be true at $20 Shape and fit were fine but this boot is not durable. Wish I had the $20 to put toward another more expensive but better made item.
3,"Good for the money, but not true to size","This boot is very cute and economical. Howerever, I ordered a size 10 and it is tight in the calf and foot. I ordered the same boot in black and it is fine, even a little loose."
5,dr. hoffer's natural nutrition for children,"how much difficult for a child is to function in school if he have learning disability?, wether it is fogy- brain, or hyperactivity, or any other mental/neurological-disability, is one question. but finding a good help is even more difficult, but no more!.this book is the natural choice for every child that realy is working, and with the best resoults. many case histories as well are showed in that book. you have got to give your child a natural fair chance.you have my warm recommandation."
3,Depending on your stance...,"The other reviewer has some valid points, but I think he may be blinded by the fact that quite a few people disagree with certain choices that the author has made in his personal and political life. In my opinion, this does not take away from the fact that this is the most honest and realistic books on the current political situation in Armenia. One who is not familiar with some of the basic issues in Armenia politics may not enjoy this book as much."
4,"Good value, great taste","Wifes loves these, but wait for the good deals when they show up to save a little money."
2,DeBoles Spaghetti !,"In years past the product was quite satisfactory. BUT in my quarterly shipment in November 2012 the spaghetti was a different color. It looked old and encrusted with old flour. It cooked up into a mush. I have used this product for years and this is the first time this has happened. Amazon would not reimburse me for the product. I contacted DeBoles in Colorado and they sent me 12 coupons. The same amount I had ordered from Amazon. I used 2 of the coupons at Akins, a health Food Store, and the product was the same as the product from Amazon. Today I used the remaining coupons for different products. I've tried to cancel my quarterly shipment from Amazon but can't reach anybody to help me. The coupons did not cover the cost of the product so basically I paid a hefty price for the spaghetti."
5,Perfect toy for orangutan lovers.,My daughter loves orangutans and is somewhat of an expert. She loved how accurately this toy depicts an orangutan! It also hangs with its arms with a velcro closure on its hands. Great size too.
1,Quite a Lemon,"I had another drive picked out; then I read the good reviews on Amazon about this product. Guess I got a LEMON. About 6 weeks after I received unit, I couldn't access it. I kept getting a message saying disc was not formatted. Did I want to format it? Well, knowing I would lose everything saved on it, I tried a few other things, including their customer service department. Finally, I said ""Ok, re-format the darn thing."" Got an error message saying it couldn't be re-formatted. I keep trying to get back to customer service at Lexar. No luck yet."
3,Burned out but replaced,"The jump drive worked fine as a weekly backup drive for about a month and then got extemely hot and quit working. I sent it to Lexar and they sent a replacement at no charge. So far, two weeks, the replacement is working fine. Good service from Amazon.com as usual and good replacement service from Lexar. Perhaps I got a lemon, but I did notice on their website that they have had some problems with other models getting hot and going dead."
3,"Expensive, and not 2 GB","The flash drive is great, and works fine, the onlty bad thing is that it is not 2 GB, it is 1.8 GB and where is the rest... I have no idea even if you would do formating the flash drive still the rest of the memory will be only on description on the package. And comparing now the prices it is expensive. But beside those things the jump drive is cute and work very good."
2,Ehhh.,I wanted to like this movie so much more than I actually did. Unfortately it was pretty much a mess from beginning to end.A great performance from Anthony Crivello though.
3,Merely Average,I consider the movie to be average; it did not appear to be a particularly clever take on the original tale - and the acting didn't particularly engage me.
4,A Must See Independent Film,"""Twisted"" is a valiant attemtpt to bring to life the story of Oliver (Academy Award Winning Masterpiece) into modern days society and culture. Wonderful Cast! From the attractive brothel boys (run by William Hickey) to the protective drag queen who spices up the screen, the diversity and depth of this picture reaches new limits. Easpecially enjoyed performances by Billy Porter (well known for his work on stage), William Hickey (playing the Fagin character), as well as Anthony Crivello (which I last saw him on Broadway in ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" w/ Chita Rivera) Highly recommend seeing this brilliant independent film!!"
3,Ok for what it's worth.,"I purchased this system for my Zumba classes. Being that Zumba is all about the music, I wanted a system that provided not only clear music, but LOUD music! It was clear, but the volume leaves much to be desired. The volume level is fair when it's just my class. (In an open gym) but I used it during an event that we had at church in the same gym, and you could barely hear it. I thought the 800 watts would be enough to blast everybody away, but I was wrong. I have to turn my Mp3 player all the way up in the volume and with the equalizer settings and then turn the volume up on the system itself. If I hadn't have had a need for it right then, I definitely would have returned this system and searched for another one."
2,No mid range and iPod dock doesn't work,"Shipped very quickly, got it with Amazon Prime next day, which I was happy about, but the PA itself is weak. it doesn't seem to have any midrange power and the iPod dock on top doesn't work at all. All I get is popping and crackling and just a hint of music once I finally get my iPod touch plugged in (which in itself is a bit of a pain), even if I turn it all the way up. Also seems like it is a refurb, though not marked as one, as the warranty seal was broken when it arrived."
1,junko,"first one tagged ""factory refirbished"" arrived bad -loud noises in background, ipod dock bad , tone controls not working, then they sent another which arrived with parts rattling around inside, and dented handle. Main transformer was not even bolted down, screws had not been retightened when they ""factory serviced"" it. After rebolting the transformer this one works except tone controls (apparently on all units) do not adjust the tone for the mic a and line inputs-just the ipod, which I find deceptive."
5,Amazing Value!!,"This is a fantastic system. Yes, it is an economy model, but for the price, it is amazingly loud and does a great job. I really don't understand all the negative reviews. I was almost scared off of buying this, but I'm so glad I bought it! Besides, with Amazon's A-Z guarantee, there is nothing to worry about.The iPod dock has great sound quality and worked with my iPhone 4 (even charges it). The inputs work well. You can tell that the microphone audio quality is not too good, but it's a nice accessory with a decent range.The only issues I've run in to are common to ALL PA systems. It's always a challenge to connect a computer cable to a 1/4"" input (without a direct box, you will pick up a soft hum). That's why it's nice to have the iPod dock. There are ALWAYS plenty of issues with wireless microphones (different frequencies, different settings, surrounding signals all can interfere and give you trouble).Anyway, I'm completely pleased with this product."
1,refurbished item sold like new,"the item arrieved with 2 screws loosen, a black tape coverin a scratch, and the power is just not there. BEWARE OF THIS SELLER AND PRODUCT"
1,Did not work,"A good idea of a product, but the execution is terrible.It just did not work when I received it. No audio from either source."
3,OK but could be better.,"Sound good for the price. Wireless microphone cheep. Replaced it with a better mic. I'm having a problem with the input jacks also. Nothing fits snug. I don't know if there is something wrong or just bad quality. It's doing the job, but not really happy with it."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"Unfortunately, the unit did not meet expectations. The hand held mic had to be literally against your lips in order to pick up. Also, the range of the mic was limited to about 7-8 feet. In order for the mic to sound good full echo had to employed. The unit was nicely made and the order processed and shipped very promptly. I would not recommend the unit as a PA but it would work fine as a portable sound system for IPod or MP3 use."
1,Poor Quality,I have purchased two of these pa systems. They have both went bad in months. Very poor quality. I have to purchase yet another pa system tomorrow. Don't buy!! It's junk.
2,iPod Dock does not work,"I am currently on my second one. The first unit would not power off. For second one the iPod dock does not work with a 5th gen nano, mostly static with a hint of music. The iPod dock would not work at all with an iPod touch 4th gen. If you can stick with the cords it works fine."
3,COULD BE ALOT BETTER,"Although the illustrations in this book are great, there are a few errors. Also alot of the examples are confusing to understand, and could be written more clearly and to the point. Of course this is the first edition, so hopefully there will be a good revision for the second edition"
2,"I agree, very hard to understand","I agree that the book could be written more clearly. Gazzaniga is a leading expert in the field, but he should be able to write more clearly"
3,they were okay,Very colorful and bright! Perfect addition to my candy table at my wedding. Nerds inside were good but the gum outside tasted horrible... almost like a cough syrup taste... I hope my guests looked but didn't taste!!
3,Sauces are just OK,I am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just OK. Nothing special... The insanity hot sauce was fun to try though. I probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive.
1,Yuck!!!!!!,This did not grab anything. It would also fold while I tried to use it. I wish I had sent it back but I gave it to a friend to pick up pine cones in her yard.
1,Reacher Does Not Work,"I was so disappointed! I should have bought from a medical supply store, I have one that came from such a store and it actually works!!"
1,Misaligned gripper,Very stiff & suction cups don't close. Ugh. I've had many of this type gripper and this is one of the worst I've ever seen.
2,You get what you pay for,"I ordered 3 of these since a more expensive one broke recently, knowing they would be cheaply made.The tips are too stiff and slick, the mid joint is too loose and will work loose, and the lock on the handgrip locks every time I use it. They will work to pick up small very lightweight items, and that is why I bought them."
2,Norpro Long Reach Grabber,not bad but a bit flimzy won't pick up anything to heavy need to spend a bit more to get a better one
1,Not pleased with this,I ordered two of the Long Arm Grabbers.When they arrived.One was nicely packed and sealed in the bag .The other bag was open. Upon examining these items I found the one in the open bag did not work.The clip holding the wire in the arm had come loose so nothing happened when the handle was grasped to pick up objects.It was obvious that this item was broken when I took it from the unsealed bag.I believe it had been returned as such and then carelessly reshipped to me.I did not return it as I had received Free shipping on the order in which it came.The cost to return it would have been almost as much as the item its self.I was very disappointed as I had ordered one for me and one as a gift.
1,fragile piece of plastic,purchased two for my mother should of known by the price i wasn't getting much. crumbled the first day upon picking up a towel. beware this is a cheaply put together plastic product pay a little more and get your monies worth
1,Save your money,"I purchase one 6 years ago and needed a new one. The one I just receive is not the same quality. The company name is not on the product anymore, makes me wonder if this is a cheap knock off. Lock broke first day that hold the arm straight."
2,disappointed whit this order,"disappointed whit this order ,received something totally different to what the picture shows ,pay for a wooden handle grabber ,i receive an aluminum piece of junk .."
2,Screw loose,"After buying at least 3 or 4 of these in the past, I am done. The little screw that holds the plastic cups and bent metal piece together ALWAYS pops out. It is just not meant to screw into rubber and stay in place. There are other styles that work better and last longer."
1,poorly constructed,this product does not do what the advertisement claims. It is poorly constructed and folds when trying to pick up an item. Would not recommend this and would not buy again
1,Wrong item,"I had written Amazon 2 times, letting them know that the image they had was completely wrong for the item description. Both times they replied back saying that NO, it wasn't.So I decided to buy this to attach to my Nvidia Quadro NVS 295 video card.Guess what???!!!! It's the wrong item. Just like I told them.This bracket DOES NOT FIT and Nvidia Quadro NVS 295 video card. The Nvidia Quadro NVS 295 video card has 2 outputs. The bracket has one hole."
1,2nd mistake Item returned,This was also a mistake. It was also returned for a refundHopefully my account was reimbursed!It wasn't a match for my system.Mary E
4,"great product, good deal","great deal on this cous cous - has gotten hard to find locally, so this is a great way to order - my only ""complaint"" is that the expiration date is only a few months - so don't buy if you plan to eat, say, only one box a month, it won't last the whole year"
2,A far cry from the gooseberry yam my mother made,"I grew up in Germany where gooseberries are plentiful, can't ever find them in California. I figured this home made jam would be similar to the one I remembered as a child, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. There in not enough fruit in this jam, and too much sugar. It tastes sickeningly sweet without acidity balancing out the sweetness - because of the lack of fruit. Too bad, I had really been looking forward to eating this jam.... and so the search continues."
5,Finally found teh Jam that I wanted,Looked in many stores for a jar of Gooseberry Jam.....found it here and it is wonderful....Just like I remember it was....
1,A little too 'lite',"I bought this book for 50 cents at my library's book sale. While I enjoy light, fluffy novels, this one is too light. The main character decides to enter the mayoral race three weeks before the election. She drops off items for a rummage sale 10 minutes before the sale opens. These details are so far beyond anything that would be reasonable in real life, that I can only assume the author knows nothing about politics or rummage sales. The totally unbelieveability of the book is so grating that I cannot enjoy the humor."
5,"Harry, I loved your book!","What I liked about your book Harry was the simple and straightforward description of the parts that make up a sale. I found it quite a useful device to start the book with What a Sale is NOT. This was a very good gradient for me and also cleared away alot of 'junk' that I've associated with the topic of sales. For someone who would never think of themselves as being a salesman, this book changed my mind. If all the sales people I run into used these principles, I would be friendlier to them!"
5,This book is INCREDIBLE!!!,"I have always felt seriously squishy about being able to sell anything. Reading this book has taken all the mystery out of the sales process and what works/doesn't work. I'm thrilled to have discovered that I already possess the skills to succeed at sales, and I now see how sales can be fun and rewarding! This is such a complete turnaround for me --I can't recommend this book enough! It deserves about 10 stars."
2,Dissatisfied/product overrated,"I wanted to give the book as a gift but it wasn't packaged nor presented ""upscale"" compared to the product. Few color shots of the product. Most single malt scotch people know something of the product; some of the info. was for someone that hasn't started drinking single malts. More product reviews would be better. the cover looks good the content was unexciting."
2,very shallow,"only thing I liked about the book is the classification of whiskies by characteristics, but you can get that online free"
2,Not one of the best works of Mayra Montero,"Now that their daughter has gotten married, this couple decides to go on a cruise to rekindle their love. As the book progresses we learn of the many infidelities this couple has committed against each other. The husband had numerous infidelities and can't seem to keep his hands of one of the passenger. The blatant display of infidelity doesn't seem to upset the wife so much anyways. To tell you the truth this book is not that good. It's literary value is diminished by how the author's portrayal of the characters. They are flimsy, not well developed and devoid of anything that makes them interesting."
4,Helpul but too polemic,Like so many authors on the issue the complexity of the Pope's behavior this falls into the defense trap. There are solid arguments in favor of and against Pius Xll behavior during the Holocaust. I personally do not believe that he was uncaring or anti Semitic but there are valid questions and diverse opinions are not necessarily anti catholic. This book is inspirational but addresses only one view of the man and his role.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest
2,Not a very compelling book.,"After reading ""Hitler's Pope"" I was interested in a counterpoise. This book doesn't serve the purpose. It is a poorly assembled collection of anecdotal evidence of Italian compassion and actually does a disservice to the case for Pius' silence."
5,Best 6 book series I've ever read,"I first read this series in middle school. I re-read the entire series again at 24 and am now 32 about to re-read it again. Best fantasy series I've ever read. I see a lot of feedback about the 6th book, which I enjoyed. I would say it's biggest flaw is in book 4, because of the different authors, the way that one of the charactors speaks (Shriek I believe, the massive spider) is completely different than the other books. That being said, the adventure in the book is still great.I don't want a lot of groans about it, but I named my son Clive, after the main charactor in this book. Yes, I loved it that much. Was such a wonderful ride and wish they would make a movie on this series. Besides, Clive is a cool name anyways."
3,fun read however,"When I read this story several months ago, I enjoyed it as fun escapism that paid homage to earlier heroic fantasy stories. However, I've just discovered that it borrows heavily from the plot ofKing Solomon's Mines (Penguin Classics). Thus I'd recommend spending time with this classic over the imitation.You might also be interested in theThe League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Vol. 1. It was this graphic novel that introduced me to Allen Quartermain, the protagonist of King Solomon's Mines."
3,Big n' firm,"These pillows are definitely big and firm. My husband and I ourselves, can't use them for sleeping, but we have smaller pillows for that. These are good quality pillows, but you may need to save for decoration if you require something more cushy to rest your head on."
3,A bit disappointing and incomplete.,"I'll get right to it. How could there ever be a retrospective of the '60s Packers with no mention at all of Herb Adderley and Willie Wood? They were two of the most important players on those championship defenses. Also, if I were someone who hadn't occasionally watched this team in the '80s, I would have thought James Lofton, John Jefferson, and Lynn Dickey never existed. I know the Packers weren't very good then, but doesn't at least Lofton -- a Hall of Famer -- deserve ""hero"" status? I figured there would be extensive footage dedicated to Brett Favre, but the history which preceded him by only a decade or so should have been included, as well. The true saving grace for me is the bonus disc, which features the ""NFL's Greatest Games: 1993 NFC Wild Card Game (aka 'Favre to Sharpe')."" I saw it on ESPN a few years ago and enjoyed it quite a bit."
4,green and gold' heroes,"double dvd on the characters that have made the most glorious nfl' franchise history.disc 1 has a durationd of 1 hour and 22 minutes, and is divided into six chapters:THE FOUNDING FATHER - curly lambeauSTARS -tony canadeo,reggie white and bart starrCHARACTERS -hornung,mc gee-blood mcnallyWARRIORS -kramer-gregg and dave robinsonMOMENTS IN TIME -mercein-the ice bowl and desmond howardICONS -don hutson,favre and vince lombardiTHE SECOND DVD is 1 hour and 10 minutes long and is related to ""the greatest game""betwwen lions and packers in 1993 wildcard.i would have also included sterling sharpe.!!!go pack go!!!"
5,Intelligent lyrics passionately delivered,I listen to this almost every day. Reminds me of the integrity inherent in Wilco's music. Melodies are beautiful...a perfect setting for the lyrics. Fun and serious.
2,watch out for shipping charges!,"The product isn't so bad. You have to be very careful about putting the frame on, because is it so tinny that it will bend or crinkle easily. But it looks nice when on.The big problem is that it is advertised for $14.95, and then it says in small print ""Note: $48.50 shipping when purchased from Adorama Camera. Not eligible for Amazon Prime."" That is a huge increase in price. I foolishly did not notice it when I ordered the frame, thinking that it was much less expensive than the frames I could get locally.There is obviously no deception, as it said clearly in the same size (small) print usually used to state shipping charges. It is my fault for not noticing. But other potential buyers should make sure to notice that small print."
3,Lust will find a way.,"Jake tried to live up to Meg's father, so when her father died and asked him to take care of Meg, her married her, only he left her alone for months at a time, going from one adventure to another, just like her father. Meg gets fed up and leaves.Jake comes home to find Meg has been gone for three weeks.Instead of telling her he is sorry, he calls a friend to stand in as his girlfriend, because he wants to see if Meg still cares.Only he finds Meg has a 2 yr old child he thinks is his best ex friend Dan's. Jake tries to get Dan and Meg back together for the child's sake. Meg is a wimp, and Jake thinks with the wrong head.Meg's friend has to step in and put Jake right because Meg doesn't have the back bone.Jake and Meg have a roll in the hay, even though they don't mean to and Meg gets another surprise.Darcy Maquire is a good writer her story is believable."
3,okay,"colors not as bright as online pic, a little grainy, and not as wide as i'd hoped, but never took note of actual measurements"
5,Problem Solver,"I've had this door close for about a year and have had no problems with it. I installed it myself. The average person who uses a drill can do it. I bought it because my storm door would just stay open if one didn't take the time to close it behind them. I own a multi family home where this was constantly a problem.Not only did this fix my problem, but because it's adjustable the door doesn't slam closed."
4,Good product for the money....,"This is the second Wright closer I have purchased for the front door in two years. The first one started leaking oil and quit working this spring. This is a different model. So far so good, but it abruptly started closing much faster about a week ago. I adjusted the closing speed and it is now fine. Hope this isn't a bad sign of things to come. Certainly the price is Wright !!!!"
4,Not Super Heavy Duty but Works,"This ""Blackburn"" water bottle cage is not as heavy duty as I anticipated, but it does the job. I believe Blackburn is a Bell brand. The holder is actually quite light despite being stainless steel, which is good for riders who need light bikes. Also, the picture made it look almost black, but it is a sort of plain ""brushed"" stainless steel. Comes with warranty and claims not to rust."
4,Very Valuable,In this book Mr.Long no longer wears a silly costume. All the pictures are clean line drawings. Contains very useful info but you really have to sit down and study it. Its not a book that you can read once or even twice and really understand the material.Its a good reference book to have on your book shelf.
3,Good book but could be better,"Main comments echo what others have said- while in the copy I got, most of the typos have been corrected, many still remain. The latest printing also only appears in paperback.My main complaint is that I bought it NEW and it didn't come with the CD-ROM with the MATLAB examples on it even though it said it should on the back cover.*** Update - apparently the code is on the author's website:[...] however I still can't find the actual algorithms. I can find a list of them and comments about them, but not the algorithms themselves."
2,A little too intense,"The book requires background knowledge, and I am told it contains many errata which can be found at [ [...] ]. My peers and I have come to the conclusion this is one of those books where it's best to just listen to the teacher."
4,It could have been the best engineering book ever,"If the typos and the software bugs weren't that many. Very good and complete reference book. It is more general than signal processing. If you can master this book you can be a very good engineer. The implementation in matlab has some bugs, but they are very helpful when it comes to understand the algorithms. It includes topics from optimization, linear algebra, probabilities etc. It's a good book to have in your library. It is worth its price."
4,Stillroven - 'Cast Thy Burden Upon The Stillroven' (Sundazed),"Myself, I've just recently discovered the little-known garage rock & roll band from Minneapolis of the late '60's. Best described as high-decibal garage rock, no doubt. Tracks here I liked best were their cover of the Monkees smash hit ""(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone"", the awesome ""She's My Woman"", Leaves cover ""Hey Joe"", ""Little Picture Playhouse"", their should-have-been a hit ""Little Games"", ""Love Is A Beautiful Thing"", Stones cover ""Under My Thumb"" and their Love cover ""Signed D. C."". Line-up: Mark Moorehead - guitar & vocals, John Howarth - guitar, Rock Peterson - bass, Dave Dean - keyboards and Phil Berdahl - drums. After reading the liner notes, I find that the band's original personnel wasn't together very long. Too bad this band couldn't last longer. Essential."
1,Waste of Money,"First of all, the video is a half an hour long, but most of that time is used to advocate Cord Blood Registry. Not that I feel it's not an important topic, but now I'm left with 20min video on massage.Secondly, the people in the ""class"" sound as if they're reading from cue cards. Badly scripted cue cards at that. Very annoying.And last but not least, the massage techniques that were shown were very very basic and repetative. If you've never had a massage, and your partner has never given a massage, then this video may be a good starting point for you. But I found that the techniques that my partner natuarally uses and adjusts with cues from me, were a lot more effective then the techiniques Lori teaches in this video. I was left feeling more annoyed and angry than relaxed by the time the video was finally over. In fact, turning the VCR off was the relief I got from this video!"
5,"good fiction, drama and human condition","This is part I of 2 volumes. Margaret Oliphant is becoming popular with readers, when I first started reading her 5 years ago, you could get her books for a couple of dollars, slowly the books have increased from high single digits to $15.oo and more. Interesting, good insight into human nature. By turns suspenseful and predictable, it's a good read if you are a person who enjoys sitting down with a good book you can get into reading."
4,"Good Band, Good CD","I bought this CD a couple of weeks ago and it has hardly left my CD player since. I got this because I was getting bored with my other stuff and was looking for something new. Mustard Plug did not disappoint me. I love ska but sometimes the vocals can be too grating or the music too harsh for my tastes - but this band has really made me happy. A few of my favorite tracks are You, Jerry, and Miss Michigan. I plan to buy Pray for Mojo in the near future. Add this to your collection today!"
4,great third wave ska,"This album is way better than their last one, Big Daddy Multitude. Mustard Plug plays catchy and tight third wave ska/punk, with the emphasis on the ska. The only thing keeping this cd from five stars is its really short length (only twelve songs), and the fact that it kind of gets boring after you listen to it for a couple of weeks.."
4,solid ska,"this is a really solid ska cd and the only reason why i'm not giving it five stars is because the lead singer's voice starts to get on my nerves towards the end of the album. but otherwise it's really great. i recommend ""Jerry"" and ""Mendoza"""
3,Mustard Plug - 'Evildoers Beware' (Hopeless Records),"Review number 40. Not exactly my cup of tea, but I thought I'd maybe check out some ska-punk - so I've heard it's called. The Grand Rapids band's second of five CD's. Tunes I was somewhat inspired by are ""Never Be"", ""Mendosa"", the slamming ""Not Again"", the swinging ""Sadie May"" and ""Dressed Up"". This is the sort of music I've seen turned up to '10' at college campus parties. Should do a lot for fans of Voodoo Glow Skulls, Save Ferris, Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Reel Big Fish."
5,Quality item,"This is an older toy. It was in great condition, not loaded with dust. I take mine out of pack, but those who dont, be pleased that seller takes care of his stock."
3,"I LOVE Jill Scott, but I didn't get it!","I LOVE Jill Scott, I'm probably one of her biggest fans. I see her in concert every chance I get, I think she's magical and wonderful. But the book....I DON'T GET IT. It wasn't what I expected. I get more about her from the music she write than the poems I read in this book. Just my opinion."
2,just Ok,I think Jill scott is Talented but much like Her Music this Poetry book is so predictable. nothing ever changes with her.funny how most songwriters Poetry Books are just average&this is the latest in that Line to me.
4,Nice earrings,"These earrings are in an attractive basket setting in 14K gold. They sparkle and are quite pretty, given that they are cubic zirconia and not authentic diamonds. Good for day-to-day wear, evening wear, special occasions."
5,Good product,I was very happy with this product. It was a gift for my nephew (go figure teenage boys) and he wears them everywhere.
2,Very cheap,"Agree with TD. The gold is not as pictured. It is very thin wire and the post bent the first time I put the back on one of the earrings. Sabrina Silver was prompt in refunding my money upon return, but I'm out the shipping. I would not recommend this product."
1,Save Your Lunch Money,"This book is absolute piece of junk. I just started in the recruiting world and I know more than this book has to offer. How can one title ""The Complete Guide to Owning and Operating a Home-Base Recruiting Business"" in 100 pgs and 1/5 of the book is for note taking? Even the sales pitch is corny and unrealistic. Can't believe I wasted a few hours of my life reading this book.Wonder if she is still in business..."
1,Where's the beef???,"Of the 117 pages in this very thin book, 35 are blank except for the word ""Notes"" at the top. May I suggest that it would be more economical to go out and buy a pad of paper and write your own book. This book should be titled ""The INcomplete Guide to Operating a Home-Based Recruiting Business."" It includes very little useful information."
2,Good for a novice,"Cawley provides good information for a novice, such as, steps of recruiting, illegal questions, available websites, sample letters, etc. However, if you have several years of recruiting under your belt, this book will not provide any new information. I found several typos throughout the book. [I didn't mean to ding the author, through Amazon, I did not have the ability to read the back cover. And I did not notice where in the description it said it was for a novice. If I did, I would not have purchased the book. Wow, I've never thought to contact the author when I find typos.]"
2,good for beginners,"It is clear that Ms. Cawley's heart is in the right place. Being new to the recruiting business, but very experienced in owning my own business's this book is short, simple and very abbreviated. I bought it because I am starting a new business and purchased everything (with in reason) I could find.About the only thing in this book that I found of value are the chapter summaries which is what the entire chapter could have been and Chapter 5 which is a valuable resource to research organizations, news letters, electronic search groups etc.Personally, Chapter 5 is worth the 10 bucks I paid for the book."
2,Owning and Operating a Home Based Recruiting Business?,Although this book had some useful information-it was very very basic-some of the information regarding the sales aspect of recruiting was not realistic either and painted a very pretty picture about the process. Although the information is useful-it is best used as a resource for those who know nothing about recruiting.
1,Not worth the money....,"At first glance, it seems like the author wrote this book within one afternoon. Too many blank pages, not worth the money, and definately too elementary even for the beginner. I finished reading this book in about an hour! Sorry, but I suggest that people avoid this book at all cost."
1,Short On Info...,"I was disappointed. There's not much here of value. ""The Complete Guide?"" Not even close. Avoid!"
4,three boys in summer,"three brothers, from twelve to fourteen years old, get money from their dad after they are done getting in the hay. they decide to use it for something special, so they take their bikes and go adventuring. to add spice to their travels, they look for people to help along the way, and lightning strikes, a barrel organ, apple pie, and a 'slow race' make it an eventful few days. the brothers made each other, and me, laugh through all of this short book."
3,Fun low budget Horror anthology...,"Production values about on par with four episodes of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE strung together, with really fun synth music (not too OTT or abrasive).I liked the film a lot, though some of the stories were better than others (the Scout leader one is definetely my favourite). I have it on DVD from the Brentwood set, will this September 2012 disc have extras? If so, I'm a getting it!"
1,The biggest bum of a horror film,"CHILLERS is an ultra-cheap film, even lower than an Ed Wood movie but Ed Wood movies are fun, this is CRAP. There is not one bit of originality in it, everything in it is like scenes jerked out from Sesame St."
3,Fabulous toy questionable durability,"We purchased this toy for my daughter for her birthday and she adores it. He is a wonderful teaching tool as well as being loads of fun as a puppet, however I have had to sew the seams back together in various places within days of purchase. Great item just not the most durable."
1,disappointed,"Snakey Skill Building Puppet by Pockets of LearningWe were so excited to find such an innovative skill building toy, gave it to our grand-daughter for her birthday, but immediately found that the zipper was impossible for even an adult to work plus the fabric it's made of was ripping away at various seams! Not durable at all, not worth the money, a big disappointment."
2,So Small,"These shoes are cute, but they run so small. I couldn't even get them on. I gave them to my sister who's foot is a little smaller than mine and they didn't fit her either. I never got to wear them, it wasn't worth the shipping cost to exchange them, but they looked cute."
3,Steve Rios Rios Sandal,Someone I now had these on and I loved them. They look great on but are not that comfortable. They tend to run small. I am a 7 and bought a 7 1/2 and probably could have used an 8.
1,Runs extremely small!,"These sandals are so cute. I always order 1/2 a size up in sandals and was very surprised and very disappointed that I can't even get my feet into these. I wear Steve Madden shoes all of the time. I now have a very cute pair of sandals that I can't wear. The shipping cost to return them, is keeping me from returning them so I'm stuck with them. It's a shame. Very disapointed...."
2,Not worth your time,This book is so basic it can only be a benifit to readers who know nothing at all about Italy or Italian people. It is a quick read but not worth your time. Read Italian Neighbors by Tim Parks if you want to meet some real Italians.
2,Hmmm,"I got interested in the topic after reading the book ""Blink"" by Malcolm Gladwell which is an amazing read so while browsing in a nearby bookstore I came across The Mind by John Taylor. I'm halfway through it now, but so far I don't find it an easy read, or as easy as Blink. The author seems to be all over the place, and even though this book is supposed to provide a user's guide about the mind and how it works, and he does that at times if you filter the rambling away, however I could easily feel a self-centered and arrogant attitude by the author since his first few pages and shows in many places across the book. His address can be rather too academic at times (because he's a professor) but it doesn't make it as easy on the average joe to follow.I got tired from his style so now I'm cherry picking certain passages just to try to get what I'm looking for. Overall I'm not satisfied with the book."
5,Great Prodcut,Does exactly what it said it does. It was easy to install and is reliable to use. I fully endorse this product.
3,good price - ok quality,I bought two of these. I already had a Sanicare product before for the master bathroom but wanted to furnish the guest and lower level bathroom. I got used toit (my wife is from Asia and it is all over there).This one does not match the quality of the original Sanicare we had:- the shower head is a true shower and sprays in a broad range where else the Sanicare is more direct. You may want that (to aim).- the quality is cheaper for the plastic but hey: what you pay forHad not problem with the sealing. I never install the included hook as I do not damage the wall (I use those 3M ones perfectly fine) but it seems okay if I did.I am not rating the need for the tool: I wonder how I lived without this before. Now we have it everywhere and that's good.
2,Great idea but.....,"I have been working on installing this for about 30 minutes. The joints were poorly put together and I have used plumbers tape to keep it from leaking. So far, it is still leaking. I probably should have just gone to the hardware store. I will give it one more try."
4,A pretty good value and easy to install,"Bottom line: While this may not be the most durable unit available it is also far from the most expensive. For the price it is a very good value.I loved that there were only two connections to make. The problem I've had in the past is getting everything sealed well enough so it doesn't leak. I learned about stuff likeNeiko 10-Pack 1"" x 520"" x 0.003-inch (thickness) Teflon Pipe Thread Seal Tapewhich made things easier but it was still a bother. With only two connections to be made it's about as easy as things get.The included valve makes it possible to adjust the maximum spray out of the handheld sprayer. The hose is plenty long and hangs securely on the included hanger.BTW, If you really want a worry-free installation and don't mind spending a bit more thenPermatex 80633-12PK Thread Sealant with Polytetrafluoroethylene - 16 oz. - Pack of 12is better than the tape. (You can buy ""just one"" at a hardware store.)"
3,Don't love it but I don't hate it either.,"First of all like stated in the other reviews this is a very cheap piece of equipment. But I only paid $20 for it so I didn't expect quality. It took my husband 30 minutes to install and when he followed the instructions exactly the darn thing leaked! He then played with for another 25 minutes and got it to where it doesn't leak but he was cussing at how terrible the directions were and glaring at me for buying it.It gets the job done, I bought it to spray off my cloth diapers. It does that just fine. I only use it about once a week and the handle is already leaking when i squeeze the tripper. I expect that it wouldn't last over long, heavy use."
4,The Fourth King - Voice of Laurie Beechman,This is an adorable animated Christmas story about the first Christmas featuring the voice of the late Laurie Beechman of Cats Fame. (Grizabella) This is the story of how the animals came to the stable for Christ's birth that first Christmas night. They had to chose who it would be. It runs 24 minutes and the song by Laurie will never be heard anywhere else. Buy this for your collection. Or show it to the Kids! Rated G
4,Works as advertised,"I have a Ford Focus that had a faulty ignition switch, apparently years 2000 to 2003 had this problem. I was going to take it back to the dealer to have it repaired but it was really expensive. Since I could still turn the key I decided to try fixing it myself. I purchased this Motorcraft switch lock kit from Amazon and saved myself a lot of money. It came with tumblers and springs which you install yourself and also instructions on how to do it. I was a little afraid to try it at first but I went on the internet and got a little help and now it is installed in my car and working fine. It seems to be of better quality than the original one but I guess I'll have to wait and see how it lasts."
1,"If Amazon.com deletes Kevin Bold's reviews, they must also delete Nemo Domi's.","Nemo Domi (_nemo_: no one; _domi_: from _domus_, ""a house"" -- ""nobody's home""?) has no business throwing stones in his/her glass house.Nemo's last three reviews had nothing to do with the book in question; instead, they were rants about Kevin Bold."
1,FREE SPEECH?,"Why is it we never hear of a liberal being shouted down when giving a speech at one of our universities? because it never happens. free speech only applies to the left. conservatives are fair game. they can be shouted at, have things thrown at them, anything goes. can you imagine the reaction of the tv networks and cnn, msnbc, if this happened to al franken? keith olberman would have a stroke. the left hate fox because they give a more balanced point of view of conservatives, and liberals. it's that simple. a conservative cable station? we can't have that. fox has to be attacked repeatedly and often. it's so nice that we have the left to decide what's best for us. I have reported nemo domi's comments about kevin bold, the fact that he/she attacks [ where have I heard that before? ] him, without commenting about the content of whatever he/she should be reviewing. amazon has chosen to do nothing."
2,Too annoying for the money,"Uses way too much ink for normal printing jobs, even when settings are adjusted down. Worst of all, every time you change a cartridge it prints an ink-wasting test page. No way to disable this feature...I've tried, including talking to tech support. There are better color printers out there. Buy one."
2,"Expensive, slow, and an ink hog as well","I don't normally buy HP printers but was looking for a speedy model for use in a work environment and was told this would be a good fit. First off, if there's a slower printer on the market today I would be amazed. My 4 year old Epson 880 will print 3-4 pages per minute faster than this unit, and the prints look far better on the Epson. Have not found 13x19 paper so I cant say how this works. The ink cartridges run out too fast to be of any use. For the price there aren't any good reasons to buy this unit. There has to be better large format printers out there, keep looking."
1,Not for Scrapbookers!,"If you are thinking of buying this printer because of the capability of printing on 12 x 12 inch paper for scrapbooking, DO NOT PLAN TO USE IT TO PRINT PHOTOS. The photo quality is actually worse than my old 3-color, HP 700 series printer. The horizontal markings from the printing are so bad it looks like you have printed on corragated cardboard. The image quality is fuzzy, and the colors are not true-to-life."
1,The biggest piece of garbage,"This printer is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever owned! Every time I print, it sounds like all of the springs are about to explode out of the side of the thing. Half of the time it will just spit out a blank piece of paper. The rest of the time it grabs anywhere from 2-6 sheets and spits THEM out! I've reverted to using my old $100 722C for everything other than 11x17. What a joke!I'm going to find another printer by epson or someone else and actually throw this one in the dumpster."
3,Okay for the Price,"I managed to test this on some 13x19"" Staples Professional Photo Paper. I would deem the quality acceptable and pretty good, although for the cost, I may as well go to a photo lab.Using a standard black and color cartridge, I printed two 13x19 inch prints and two 8.5x11 prints.Do not use the photo cartridge, print speed was faster, and colour was okay, but for some reason I get streaks when using the photo cartridge.Printer functions well, I do get occasional jamming when printing long banners, ink cartridge prices are high, and it uses a lot of ink when printing photos, but sometimes the ink indicator sensor is incorrect as I've been able to print sometimes quite a bit more even though the cartridge is shown as nearing empty.Overall, decent printer, probably cheapest wide format out there and taking that into consideration, it does the job for the price you pay."
1,Not Happy with HP or Fedex,"I have not even got a chance to test this printer b/c when I opened the box there were no ink cartridges. I check everything and they were no where to be found. This is after fedex took three tries to find my address, which we get deliveries to about 2-3 times a week. Anyway I called HP, and they informed me that they would have to replace the whole printer in order for me to get those cartridges. Fedex would have to come to pick it up and then a new one would be delivered to me, no way! I decided to get my money back and return the printer. The sales rep was nice and she gave me no problem with the return. However I'm still waiting for the printer to be pick up and my credit card refunded so lets see how that goes. This marked the first and last time I will ever buy an HP product. I will purchase the canon i9900 instead and it got much better reviews. (note I bought the 9650 off of hpshopping.com and not amazon.com)"
4,Good but not perfect.,"Used this printer for two years now and very few problems.Pros:13 x 19 Capability is very useful to me.With proper drivers, has lots of flexibility and controlGood print quality even with photographsParallel and USB connectivityReasonably pricedCons:Small ink cartridgesNoisySlow print speedOther:Occasionally to rarely loses it's mind and spews out page after page of one line gibberish. This may be an application or driver issue - still troubleshooting. Press clear document button and clear print queue on PC to stop."
4,Much additional information appreciated.,To know the true story behind Braveheart was especially interesting. Good companion to the movie and it filled in spots.
5,gypsy moth circles the world,great service; already had the book and gave it as a gift. very happy with everhthing
4,Breadshop's Triple Berry Crunch,"The berries are very tasty, but I was disappointed that it's not a ""true"" granola. There are corn flakes in it. I would have to rate it a very good ""cereal""."
3,Too many crumbs!,I bought this cereal because I needed a wheat free cereal and this had so may good reviews.While the taste is good with lots of berries there were no clusters at all. - only crumbs !!I am disappointed and would not consider it a granola.
2,Corn Flakes with a Twist,"I found this item while searching for Granola and Berries and looked forward to it's arrival. However, I was very disappointed with the abundance of corn flakes. Like other reviewers the amount of granola crumbs is disheartening too. The Triple Berries are yummy and I would have enjoyed this WITHOUT the cornflakes. There's too many cornflakes to pick out...yes the thought crossed my mind!"
5,Amazing!,"When I first heard this song I couldn't even speak. That voice, that intensity, that softness... Really, it touches your heart."
4,Lot of space - Slow updates,Drive works well with Windows XP Professional. It is noticably slow in updating larger files (i.e. 2MB spreadsheets).
1,Fell apart in my hands after week 3 of ownership,"Kept it on my keychain, don't do much in the way of abusing it--it stays in my front pocket or hanging from my bulletin board. I plug it in about once a day on average. I noticed as soon as I took it out of the package that the case was a bit-- well, you could sort of *move* it under your fingers. Tonight I pulled it out of my computer tower and both halves fell apart in my hand, leaving the guts exposed. It was fun to look at but I expected better build quality.Slow as molasses, falls apart in less than a month--experiencing some real buyer's regret right now."
2,Not very good,"I don't use thumb drives a lot but when I do it's because I have to carry a big file (usually a software installation program). I carry it for times downloading takes too long. I have had two Firefly 4GB drives for about a year. But with this unit I wind up downloading again almost every time, it does NOT maintain file integrity. At least 5 times I've had to rewrite or re-download files. Can't recommend it."
2,The reviews are right: This is slow,The reviews about this being a slow USB drive are correct. I think I've had USB1.1 devices that were more responsive than this. I would have given it 1 star but it still has the smallest form factor out there.
3,"does the job, but slower than other flash drives","This JumpDrive does the job, but it's substantially slower than other flash drives I've used. Specifically, compared to the Lexar Lightning or the SanDisk Contour, the JumpDrive, it's practially a snail. Then again, it is less expensive than other USB drives."
2,Slowwwww. Go with SanDisk instead.,"I may not be Jack Bauer, but I am a software developer, and I prefer to save my files on a removable drive. While the other reviewer's work might not require high speed, my work does. When running the compilers and debuggers, this thing just can't keep up and the IDEs choke. It's unacceptable, as it grossly impacts the time it takes me to do my work. I bought it because it was small and a good price... but, as they say, you get what you pay for.My previous drive was a 256 Meg Sandisk Cruzer. Looks like I'll shell out some money and get another Sandisk. Much better. (But I recommend dumping the installed U3 software that comes on it.)However, that said, the reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one is if you don't need speed and are looking for a good price, this seems to be just fine."
1,Fraud,"This is not the Battle of Midway with Henry Fonda et al. It is a 17 minute Department of War short, with actual footage. It is not the movie titled under Military and War as The Battle of Midway. Where is the latter?"
1,Not What It Was Advertised to Be,"I bought this dvd because I gained the impression from other reviews about it that it would be a documentary about the battle of Midway. When it was delivered to me, it turned out to be the feature film 'Midway' starring Charlton Heston (which I already own). I was not happy and returned the dvd for a full refund."
2,Propaganda Film,The Battle for Midway is 20 minute propaganda film. Global War follows the Allies march to Rome(30 min). For $7.49 what can you expect?
3,Tora Tora Tora,"Excellent rendition of historic facts , some of the battle scenes were well done , but the political blunders made by both sides was appalling. but i think that is human nature."
2,GERMAN HOME COOKING,"THE BOOK WAS OLDER THAN I EXPECTED, YELLOW PAGUES AND THE FRONT PAGE BENDED.IT CAME ON TIME, THE PACKING WAS GOOD, THE WORST WAS THE BOOK ITSELF IN THE INDEX SOME PAGUES ARE OUT.IT IS A COPYRIGHT FROM 1963. AND IT LOOKS THAH OLD AT LIST.............."
4,"Perhaps the Best ""Rumpelstiltskin"" Story","In this West Indian version of Rumpelstiltskin, Queen Quashiba marries the rich and powerful Big King, but must produce three rooms full of gold cloth after a year and a day or be locked away forever and a year. How will she ever accomplish such a supernatural feat?The book is richly illustrated with vibrant colors and the words are pleasing to read silently or aloud. Both Virginia Hamiltion and the Dillons prove to be masters of their respective crafts and together produce a winning combination in their version of this classic tale.Crazy James"
4,"Solid construction, wire size good for high amp applications","Appears to be suited for most applications, other than submerged possibly.Wire size is good for fog lights or other similar apps."
1,Not for Beginners and Doesn't Live up to the Hype,"I thought ""How to Design Programs"" would be a good way to learn programming, but the book has too much math for a beginner to understand. I would recommend using some of the free online websites, such as Codcademy, that are much easier and effective ways to learn programming languages.The majority of the exercises and explanations are poorly written. The authors might be great programmers but they are terrible writers.This book and course doesn't live up the hype."
4,A landmark textbook,"In the hands of the right teacher, this textbook is the best introduction to computer science, bar none. Students who complete this textbook will be able to calmly and methodically tackle complex programming problems that would be a struggle for many professional programmers.However, I would not recommend it for self-study. Most of the high school students I have worked with found it hard to follow on their own.Furthermore, in the decade since this book was first published, the authors of the book have continued to evolve this style of teaching, so some parts of the book are out of date (not in the sense that they don't work, but in the sense that it is no longer the recommended way to teach this material). All of the drawing exercises, for example, are now obsolete in favor of a new and improved animation teachpack.I fully expect the second edition of this book will resolve these issues, and I look forward to giving the second edition a full five stars!"
5,Comfy Comic,Could not be more comfortable -like most Franco Sartos and true to size. Could easily wear them all day and quite cute looking.
5,Reminiscent of a more romantic era,"I originally ordered these shoes from Macy's, but when they arrived, they were a little too small. Unfortunately, when I logged onto the website to order a larger size, Macy's appeared to no longer have the item in stock. I was so enamored of them that I searched the net until I found them here on Amazon. It just so happened that Amazon was selling them for half the price that they were from Macy's.I have an appreciation for classic, older styles, and these shoes are perfect with both skirts and jeans. I've received many compliments at work, and they are unbelievably comfortable.As for needing a larger size... I don't believe they run small. I think I've just gone up a shoe size. :)"
2,Looks nice but...,"I like the looks, a bit neater than the ordinary ones. I also like the open door dial feature. Works nice and easy. However mine only lasted a year, then the pneumatics were shot. I have a standard metal screen door. Not heavy at all. I'd say it's too high priced for only a year of use. Guess I'll just go back to the cheap ones."
2,Annoying Hold-Open Mechanism,"Smooth closing, but annoying ""twist"" hold-open mechanism and too easy to change the adjustable close-rate."
2,Flimsy plastic frame,"This frame isn't great quality, it arrives in parts & you slot the black edges together.It's ok to preserve a poster, but doesn't look very good for display purposes."
1,bad bad bad,"the frame was delivered broken... i went ahead with attempting to use it, and it maybe lasted a month on the wall. i would NOT recommend this product to anyone, it's not worth a dime!"
2,"Can you say, ""junk""?","Not even worth the low cost. I wouldn't buy this again, and don't recommend that you buy it either.Lightweight plastic throughout. Started falling apart immediately.Not a good product."
2,Heavy and Broken,"I ordered two of these and the items arrived while I was on vacation. One corner and of the packaging was crushed. The frames unsurprisingly had crushed corners as well. When I tried to return them for replacement, I was told that it was past the 7 day return period (should have read their policies more carefully).These are also incredibly heavy for just hanging a poster. The backing is like particle board while the frame itself is pretty cheap stuff.The items would be fine if they were undamaged, but would require more than just a nail in the wall to hang like other poster frames I have ordered."
3,Be sure you do not need to buy this book new.,My instructor required some sort of MCP code to access a website for my online classes. Apparently this is only sold with the book when new.
3,Dense to a fault,I am not sure this book needed to be this dense. Perhaps the authors were communicating too much when they wrote it. The information is pretty easy to grasp. Not my favorite class which this book was bought for.
2,Poor product,"I purchased a 1220P less than a year ago and from the very start it was noisy,slow, and finiky about sending images to the printer. A week ago it finally gave up the and started displaying mult-colored lines through the image. Tried a number of times to get through to Umax to no avail. Scraped it and bought another brand."
2,Home use of Umax Vistascan Astra 1220P,"For infrequent home use, this is really not a bad scanner for the low price. However, it does not hold up well to frequent use. Image quality is what you would expet from a lowend scanner. After about 1 year, I started to get colored lines through the image. These will disappear if you cycle the unit in preview mode several times. Even with this problem, at $...you can afford to throw it away and get a new one after a year."
3,"Great Images, although slow and buggy","When I owned this scanner I thought the image quality was top noch. Colors were acurate. Details and sharpness were good.I was using on a Win98 machine. However, it was very slow and I kept having to reinstall the twain drivers because they would get corrupt causing green or black scans. It was much worse when I switched to WinME. Then when I upgraded to WinXP I just got rid of it. I have not been to happy with what I replaced it with, the Epson perfection 1660, so I'm currently looking for another scanner."
1,burned by umax,"I purchassed my umax 1220p in good faith, At the time i was using win 98. Had no problems, was a good scanner and was satisfied with it. but due to computer problems i rebuilt my system and upgraded to win ME. well to my suprise, every time i loaded the software into the puter, my system would crash! I have looked into other peoples problems with umax 1220p.win 2000 and win ME does not support this scanner. umax did not write 32bit programming for it..... so if you have or plan to get either win 2000 or ME do not buy this scanner. Burned to a singe.... Tim"
2,UMAX Astra 1220P - Support Issue,"Scanner works well with Windows 98. However, is now obsolete with Win-XP unless I purchase an updated driver from UMAX. I am not happy with this hidden cost."
1,"Don't Buy, Incompatible with Me, 2000 and XP","Bought this scanner a year ago, Upgraded to XP. Now scanner is paper weight. UMAX does not support any version of windows past 98 for this scanner and according to their web site and tech support there are no plans for support in the future."
5,Much Needed Reference,"LESBIANS TALK: VIOLENT RELATIONSHIPS is the first book on abusive lesbian relationships to be published in the UK. Basing their research on an extensive survey of survivors' own experiences, the authors draw up a picture of how abuse happens and how we might deal with it. Essential reading for professionals working with violence and abuse, lesbians who have for too long ignored the problem -- and, of course, for anyone who has survived or is undergoing an abusive relationship."
1,LISTEN TO TIMOTHY! It's a TOTAL Rip off!!,"Look people, at most Wal-Marts, Targets, & Drug Stores, you can get one box for UNDER a dollar! Weather it be 88 or 99 cents!And even at the high-priced Drug Stores, and at Gas Stations, you can get one box for $1.50, MAX!So for $10.00, you could be getting 10!Yes, buying online saves you a trip to the store.But is it REALLY worth 6 extra bucks?And that's not even the tip of the ice burg, they have the nerve to charge $7.50 for SHIPPING!!!!!!!IT IS NOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT WORTH, an EXTRA $13.50!!!!!A total of $17.50! For something you can get for $4.00!!!COME ON!TOTALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLRip off."
4,Good price .. fit my phone ..,Picked it up cheap by measurement and it fit my evo shift .. Good quality and cute/compact .. I would say good for females ..
3,An Historical Novel,Edah Ropkey left a novel to describe the life that she lived and observed by leaving Indianapolis to join the oil rush in Oklahoma. She puts on display teh hurt feelings of the upper class women who were taken from their comfortable homes and subjected to primitive and precarious conditions and at least temporary poverty. A nice effort is made to describe the different sorts of people involved and their various fates.
4,TWO IN THE FIELD,"I KNOW ABOUT THE BOOK, HAVEN'T READ IT YET. I KNOW IT'S A SEQUEL THE OTHER BOOK WHICH I ENJOYED. REALLY WANT TO GET TO IT, THANKS FOR GETTING IT TO ME. A BASEBALL NOVEL!!! WHO WOULD HAVE 'THUNK"" IT!!!!!"
4,Love the Bears,This was a perfect gift for my husband and boys. They are huge Bears fans.Shipping was fast. Product is exactly what I had hoped for.
4,Hard Hitting Defense,"This DVD, A Tradition of Defense: The Chicago Bears, is very good and complete as far as the history of great Bear Defenses is concerned. They go all the way back to the 20's and 30's with Grange and McAfee. Bulldog Turner, Buffone, George, Atkins, etc. are covered. Of course the 46 Defense is covered and my favorite character, Steve McMichael, made the all time team as a DT."
5,Great buy for a Bears fan,I have to say I didn't watch much of this video because I bought it for my son for Christmas but my son and husband are Bears football nuts and they loved it. Would definitely buy again.
2,Torn in two.,"Even someone with a passing knowledge of the Internet, like myself, knows a good deal of what is in this book. The first half starts off useful enough, but like most books on technology diverges into sections that are seemingly ""no briainers"" and sections that are so specific as to be less than useful. The second half is mostly just addresses of sites and reads like a TV Guide.Two stars, one for each of the pieces it was in when I finished reading it. Money ill spent."
5,A blockbuster of a reference book to keep next to your PC.,"I have heard of books you 'just can't put down' until you have finished it. This comes as close as I have experienced. I not only ordered one for me but one for my son, too. A fantastic reference."
4,Two boys' review: The best Penguin for our Batman collection,"Posable, richly designed and fun to play with, this is the only Penguin action figure we can recommend. The design comes from ""The Batman"" animated TV show but isn't so drastic a change as the redesigned Joker.Because of his size and shape, the Penguin can't be moved into as many positions (as the Joker, for example) despite being fully articulated. That's really the only drawback. My sons often play with this action figure without using the swinging ball accessory just because the Penguin is more often the criminal mastermind and less often engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Batman."
3,really works,"I questioned whether this would work like in their video. It does, I would say even better than the steel bladed dethatchers I have rented. Although the mantis takes much longer to cover the same amount of lawn.The biggest problem is the duribilty as the tines bend quite easily."
4,Seduction of the Innocent,"The good doctor Giles Pennyfeather is introduced in this tale. He is a good-natured medical embarrassment who is hopeless in the modern world but who can perform medical miracles in Third World environments. Modesty's plane drops out of the sky and she finds herself stranded at Gile's makeshift hospital in the middle of Central Africa, so she makes herself useful as his nurse. Unfortunately, the local criminal element muscles Giles out of the area under Modesty's watch, and Modesty doesn't let her friends get ruffled without a fight. Willie joins the odd couple and they all do battle against guerillas, a gorilla and Mother Nature. All of this leads to the immense fortune known as The Impossible Virgin, the specifics of which I will leave to the honorable Peter O'Donnell. Another smashing success for Modesty Blaise!"
3,A five star book for Brits?,"I enjoyed Steel's book on the French Revolution, so I thought I would give his other book a try. As an American with little understanding of British politics, I thought I might learn a bit as I went.That said, the book is not published in the U.S. and that should have been a tip off. It seemed that there were three references per page that were lost on me. Some chapters were dense and meaningless enough to me that I just skimmed them. This book is not ""learn more about recent British politics"", rather ""commentary assuming you already know British politics.""But the rest were excellent. Steel is quite funny in this book. And despite my complaints, I did learn quite a bit about the landscape of British politics. But the heart of the book is Steel's personal path: participating in demonstrations, recounting how he espoused Socialist views to his friends, becoming famous-ish, and essentially growing up. And all of that is excellent."
5,Extras as good as originals,"Our bottles came with a couple of these, but we needed more for traveling. They arrived quickly in great condition."
5,Oh so Helpful...,I had used the Dr Browns bottles for years and never had these. What a great little accessory to use when storing bottles of formula in the refrigerator. A very small price for a very big convenience.
2,Ehh...,"I did not find this recording very inspiring. George Crumb is an excellent composer, and the Makrokosmos cycles are excellent. However, as a pianist, I found that this recording is not really true to the music itself. The performer ignores some of Crumb's essential markings that sometimes make the pieces special. I have to admit that this recording is nearly alone in the world, so to have this recording is a blessing. It could be better, though."
5,El Mar,"I have dozens of children's books in Spanish, which I use for teaching my 2yr old daughter Spanish and this is one of my favorites. My daughter really likes some of the pretty illustrations, specially the ones with the seagulls and fishes. The textual descriptions are simple and suitable for reading to very young children. Living in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, it's very difficult to find good children's books in Spanish. Many books are translated from English, and many have spelling and grammatical errors. This book is written and printed in Spain. It has a European flavor."
2,Academic Abstraction,"If you're a university professor who likes to philosophize and/or wants to impress other university professors, or are a university student with similar goals, this is a good book for you. If you're looking for something applicable, or tied to modern real-world society, it'll just make your head hurt.The book basically just pits anthropological theorists against one another, with a couple of tie-ins to tribal case studies. There is a -great- deal of theorist name-dropping which a beginning reader will not understand. The book finishes with a couple of adamant theoretical statements about academic concepts that don't clearly tie in to or suggest any ""real world"" course of action.As abstract academic books go, though, I will say that the subject matter is interesting and the writing could be a lot worse."
5,Shock Troops of the Confederacy,"Fred L. Ray has added a new understanding of the important role of a little-known group of Confederate units that helped make the Army of Northern Virginia the most renowned fighting force of the war. Ray's excellent writing style takes the reader on a fascinating journey, from the development of these sharpshooter units through their important contributions during the war. Ray also does a great job of personalizing the stories of the men who served in these specialized units. This is a very informative and important addition to the library of anyone interested in the Army of Northern Virginia."
4,These are great!,These dogs go great with the traditional size Breyer horses.They would be the wrong scale for any of their other sizes.I am giving a Breyer horse as a gift and thought these would go great with the horse. I would have loved to have them when I was growing up!The paint job and detail is very nice.
1,Quite Simply The Worst Movie Ever Known To Man,"This movie is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. It make's Battlefield Earth And Waterworld look like Oscar Quality films.I saw this movie a couple years back and then again when it was broadcasted on Disney Channel and i thought I was gonna throw up from this hideous movie do your self a favor and if you even see this movie in a video store just look away ... ...this movie sickens me so much that i need not get myself started.In other words ""WORST MOVIE EVER MADE""."
1,"Honestly, If you want to stay sane.","never watch this movie, no plot, no nothing, stupid immature jokes, and everything. Seriously, disney must've been on some drugs when the agreed to make this...."
2,Way toooooooooo wacky,This movie is something you see once. The plot is totaly unbelievable. The in it is cute though!
1,Just...boring,"I wasn't entertained once during the movie. I could write the rest of the story accurratly after the two brothers reached Yellowstone. The movie set the boundry to how bad a film can get. I dunno, Maybe its because I'm a teenager."
3,Little Juvinile,"Umm, personally I love Paul Walker, but the plot of the movie was a tad bit to Cali for him. He was very immature in hte role he played."
4,A movie better than the reviews written about it.,"Meet the Deedles is much better than Bill and Ted. So-called professional film reviewers trashed one of the few films a family could see with something for everyone. It was released during Easter of 1998. Talk to the kids! They liked the Deedles, especially the intelligent one."
2,no salt,"I was severely disappointed by this product. my dad gifted me a subscription to it, but with the lack of salt and abundance of raisins, it's just not something I can enjoy eating. If you like a shit ton of raisins and unsalted nuts, you'll probably be a fan of this, but I certainly was not."
3,Not for me,"This review sucks because I'm split on my basis. There was nothing wrong with the product and most anybody would be happy with it. I did not necessarily like it, therefore, was not so happy. I am looking for a nutritional snack but I do not care much about diet (I'm okay with getting all the bad stuff as long as I am also getting the good stuff). My first issue was the lack of salt. Yes, great for most who care about that, but I do not (give me my hypertension). The second is a lack of the chocolate pieces. The overall characteristics seem disproportionate to me as they use chocolate raisins and chocolate peanuts on top of the already added raisins and plain peanuts. I just becomes peanut-raisin overkill."
2,These are not M&Ms and you can tell,"I was disappointed in this snack mix. The ratio of raisins, nuts and chocolate is fine, but the chocolate itself was not good. Many of the pieces were broken, they melted easily and the taste was too sweet, not at all as good as actual M&Ms. If the chocolate is important to you, I think you should skip this mix."
3,Product was okay,The product was as described but I was expecting a little heavier quality based on price. The sides do not meet perfectly.
2,24X36 Black Frame,"The (U-shaped) frame is cheap plastic, and just slides over the clear plastic front and cardboard back. The whole frame is bowed, so it does not lie flat on the wall. No quality.You takes your chances, and learn your lessons."
1,Got wrong item,"I ordered this 24x36 frame but got something far smaller. I tried to amend the situation but it was so complicated and finding the seller was impossible so I just gave up and used the smaller frame for another poster. Very disappointing. There is nothing at all wrong with the frame, it's just not the size I wanted and I thought I'd just give up rather than frustrate myself further."
1,Garbage,"The frame is extremely low quality plastic and does not lie flush at the corners. When I received the package the acrylic was damaged in multiple spots, the worst area having a crack all the way through it. Disappointing, and will not do business with them again."
2,acrylic frames,Cheaply made; flimsy. tried to put a poster in one frame and couldn't get the plastic side bars to slide back on frame. Would not recommend these.
1,Family Tree Maker for Dummies is a waste of money,This book is more than 12 years out of date! Shame on me for not noticing the publication date! Shame on Amazon for selling this as new!Out of date and does not match the program I bought it with. The 2011 FTM program is the newest version and the book is geared for Vs. 7. Waste of money.Amazon should withdraw it from their stocks!
3,Juvenile mystery with Parisian flair,"Paul Berna wrote juvenile mysteries in French, which were translated into English. His ""Horse without a Head"" was even made into a film. This book was one of those childhood ""mystery books"" that I couldn't find anywhere. I knew ""black cat"" juvenile, set in Paris, read it 1970-1973 in English. When I was able to track it down and read a synopsis on Wikipedia--voila! It's funny and adventurous and has a tremendous set of young, ambitious journalists, and a detective who finds himself working with a young partner. It is set in Paris at a time when apartments were in scarce supply--the family is conned out of their savings bribing a tenant to sell them a rug and cabinets. The young boy traces the black cat that was on the scene to find--with a great deal of help--the con artists. Francophiles--get this man back in print in English!"
5,Forever a Student of Prof. Peterson,"I had the opportunity to read his original manuscript when I was a student at Harvard. His class, text, and brilliant insights into the human condition truly expanded, challenged, and forever changed the way that I view religion, psychology and meaning. This book remains a ""must read!"""
4,Casio Watch,This watch was just what I was looking for with the date diplay. It was a little complicated to set at first but seems to be working good. It is very clear and easy to read. I would strongly recommend it and it was half the price on Amazon.
4,Neighb'rhood Childr'n - 'Long Years In Space' (Sundazed),"Sole CD compilation release of this short-lived psychedelic / garage rock band that came from the small town of Medford,Oregon. All 24 tracks were recorded between 1967-68. Looks like their original lp on CD reissue with at least ten(10) bonus cuts. Definitely worth checking out. Tunes I was digging the most are ""Feeling Zero"", the title cut ""Long Years In Space"", ""Please Leave Me Alone"" (heard this song was an actual hit), their Yardbirds-influenced ""Chocolate Angel"", their Beatles cover ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Tomorrow's Gone"" and their unlikely track ""Over The Rainbow"". Line-up: Dyan Hoffman-keyboards&vocals, Rick Bolz-guitar&vocals, George Glen-bass and John Morrison-drums. Might appeal to fans of Jefferson Airplane, Touch, Moby Grape and possibly Love."
4,A good text in numerical analysis,I have a better but much more expensive textFirst Course in Numerical Analysis (International Series in Pure & Applied Mathematics)that lacks the Fortran computer code in this book that can usually be translated to other computer languages with some effort.The recursion form for -1+Sqrt[2] that I found on page 157 can be made intoa general form that will give the golden mean.The only thing better about the higher priced book is that it has more in depth coverage of numerical analysis ( graduate level).For me this book is a very welcome addition to my reference library that has taught me several things already.
1,Tedious Drivel With Some Interesting Factoids,"Some of this book is well written, articulate and convincing. Large portions of it are repetitive drivel, restating old threadworn cliches from the sixties. It's too bad a good editor didn't realize the latter portions effectively weaken the argument for drug legalization. Obviously, many have labored to keep drugs out of the hands of the multitudes but one has to be careful when approaching the conspiracy theory. Good people over time have made some uninformed decisions that definitely ought to be re-examined in light of better evidence today. Prejudice and misconception have played their role. And, to be fair, some anecdotal evidence suggests opponents of marijuana usage sometimes may have had less than altruistic motives. But the proposition that businessmen manipulated legislation prohibiting pot smoking just don't fly."
3,good solo debut,"This isn't bad. If you're a fan of blue mountain this is an essential purchase. I'm afraid I can't see this winning too many converts though (unless you see this guy live. i saw blue mtn. twice- best shows i've ever seen). I miss the harmonies with the ex-wife Laurie, but I guess that was bound to be gone when their marriage ended. I'd say it's time for him to tour in the NE though. Come to PA Cary!"
1,HARD laffy taffy,Candy is not fresh. It is now hard candy rather than taffy. Will not purchase here again.
1,Too Bad I'm An ACLU Member,"I don't know what to do about this book now. I don't want to give it away because someone might think I support this homophobic, misogynist book. I can't give it to a used book store because I really don't want anyone else to read this book. I don't want to send back the book to the author because I don't want any more of my money to be associated with this book, and I can't burn it because I am against censoship. I do think that the author has a right to write. I guess that's what I get for buying a book in a bar. This is my only recourse...write this review: This book is wrong. It is wrong because it was overtly anti-lesbian, it was wrong because it used language to degrade all women, and it was wrong because the entire middle of the book could have been condensed into one page. The positive attributes of this book are that the cover of the book is green, Kurt Vonnigut reviewed the book, and that it mentions Terre Haute."
5,Humor and Mystery all in one,"After first picking this book up, I couldn't put it down. Mysteries don't normally intrique me, but McMillen spawned an intricate plot with an enormous amount of humor. The characters are all ""straight to the point"" people, and the dialogue and emotions are very realistic. This book made me think, laugh, but most of all proud---it was very exciting that my own university advisor published a book, while I was one of his students. I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't want to read the same old boring stuff."
4,Fernando Flores review,"Vampire high by Douglas Rees is a fictional book. The book's theme is that people from different places can have a big affect on different groups of people.The main problem in the story is that other vampires except his friends mostly hate the main character in the story. In one part of the story he has to write an epic for one of his classes. The epic has to be due at the end of the year.I think Vampire High is an awesome book because this book is entertaining and interesting. It was a good vampire book, it is not like Twilight. This book isn't based on a love story this book is mainly focused on a boy that is trying to fit in a weird town. The chapters on this book are really good because when you read the chapters you can image the things they are speaking about.I suggest you read Vampire High if you love reading books on people who are having trouble in their lives. Also because this book will keep you entertain."
2,"No ""Fangs""...I'll Pass","Yes, I am breaking into the two-star barrier...and the jenti's (what the heck?!) barrier by suggesting ""Dracula"" instead. I'll take the classic, subtle romantic period and ""Dracula""'s one hundred fourteen years of never-ceasing, beautifully horrific reign. Do not peruse the confusing, weirdish details this book is immersed in, and I will try to get this book back to Franklin Township Public Library in Jersey. I am so glad that I am not in high school hangin' with the goth crowd. And if I was, I would just suggest watching the 1985 (italics, please) ""Fright Night"" if I wanted vamp culture and secondary education intertwined entertainfully. I know, I know- you wanna throw me to the wolves...it's O.K.; we have a lot in common."
3,12+ Language,"This book was pretty good, but not exciting or anything. Also be careful because there is quite a bit of language, about every five pages or so."
5,Entertaining and quick read,"Imagine yourself thrown into a situation at school where you can do no wrong, and are settled for life. Straight A's and a guaranteed good life if all you do is sign up for water polo. That's where Cody finds himself in this book, where he has a tough decision to make. You already know what kind of school he goes to, but the main thing I liked about this book was his inner argument about being able to hold his own, and not taking everything with a blind eye. A story told by Cody in his own words, about making friends and enemies along the way. I finished this book in a little over two days, as Rees makes everything flow very easily from page to page. A good read for a student who's looking for something different."
1,"Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad","I got the album for It's Still Rock N' Roll to Me, by Billy Joel. The song is completely digitized and it sounds awful. It doesn't even sound like the same song. As for the rest of the album, none of the songs are worth your money!"
1,Why?,"Why would you want a CD where it changes the songs from their original form? I hardly has enough tracks to represent the wonderful music of either of Billy or Elton. Don't Buy it! Get a real CD such as Billy Joel's ""The Stranger"" or Elton John's ""Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy""!!!!"
4,"A great, ground breaking CD!","This a well done and sounds great and powerful. The only problem with this CD is some songs a bit to long; however it is still an amazing CD, and I would definently recommend it to anyone who likes hype rap or bangin' rock."
4,Classic alblum from this Hall of Fame rap group. Don't miss,"If you are looking for excellent old school rap, look no further. The Kings of rock, and obvisously rap, took rap to the mainstream. This trio were one of the first to add rock ""King of Rock"" and reggae ""Roots, Rap, Reggae"" to their hip hop. Though not as tight as their self titled debut, the second alblum still belongs in every hip hop head's library!!! When I build the hip hop hall of fame, they surely will be one of the first groups selected."
3,Subpar effort from the kings of rock,"If you listen to the records in reverse order, this albums pales in comparison with ""Raising Hell."" Many of the songs have great hooks, but are repetitive to the point of boredom (like ""Jam Master Jammin""). But, never mind what I just said: ""King of Rock"" is probably one of the 5 best rap songs of all time (the logical successor to ""Rapper's Delight""). Silly lyrics, fun, and doing the rock/rap thing way before lamos like Limp Bizkit and Rage Against the Machine jumped on the bandwagon."
5,Dr Who girl brings extra magic to The Magical Scarecrows,"Length:: 9:08 MinsThis video shows Dr Who Girl Katy Manning and other celebrities in the latest philanthropic venture of The Magical Scarecrows to raise funds for disabled and disadvantaged children through Variety Club, and furthermore this latest celebrity DVD recording of Magical Scarecrows stories is positively the best yet!! BUY THEM ALL - THEY'RE BRILLIANT!!!"
1,Real rock!?!,"Anybody who likes this album, or Creed for that matter, needs to jump in the wayback machinge and visit Seattle of the early 90's. It's quite appropriate that Jerry Cantrell is opening for Creed and 12 Stones this time around because without bands like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Grunttruck, etc. neither one of these bands, as well as Bush, would have any idea of what to sound like. To even refer to them as 'Alternative' is about as far fetched as you can get. I must be getting old, because every 'new' band coming out these days sounds exactly the same and horrible at that."
2,Similiar sounding to KUTLESS - almost TOO similiar,"I'm more of a hard rock fan (Poison, Tesla etc)but I do enjoy some new gems like KUTLESS & SWITCHFOOT ( & new TESLA of course ). I listened to this CD once and nothing really stuck with me. What's funny is after someone mentioned they are similiar to KUTLESS I realized the vocals from the 1st song on this CD, CRASH sounds similiar to KUTLESS' LET YOU IN from their cd SEA OF FACES. You can hear for yourself through the samples at amazon.com.Noah"
5,"Lyrics, very important","I have had this cd for at least 2 years but only had listened to it one time. I listened to it again the other day and thought it was a very good cd. Then I found out that it was Christian Rock. I never really paid attention to the lyrics, but after listening to them it was obvious. I can't say what my favorite track is on the cd but ""Back Up"" and ""Running Out of Pain"" have very good lyrics. It makes me happy just listening to the cd."
3,Not Bad,"12 Stones' self-titled debut album is a decent start to a band that has a lot of potential. Sounding like a harder Creed with a better singer (not that its hard to sing better than Scott Stapp...), without the preachy lyrics, 12 Stones could one day be a big band.As far as this album goes, there are a couple standout tracks, including Back Up and Eric's Song. Unfortunately, almost every song sounds exactly the same and the lyrics are generally rather uninspired. Even though each song sounds the same, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The album sounds quite good, but if you're looking for incredible song variety you're looking at the wrong album.So you wont find anything revolutionary or new here, but you will find a decent rock album here with 12 Stones' debut album."
4,Fantastic Album,"I remember when this disc came out and you could pick it up brand new for like 8 bucks. I got it for the first time tonight, paid $15. I am listening to it now, and I am really enjoying it. I think my favorite thing about it is that it is heavy with great guitars and a positive message (sans the cursing and doom and gloom). Well worth the time and money. Likewise for Potter's Field."
3,Okay,"I came back from church at stopped at Media Play to buy this. I was so exited! I got my hopes up for nothing. For majority of the cd, they used the same chord. It's a great tune but it just gets annoying after a period of time. The words are okay but the just don't math the music. I think this band has potential and might bloom into something good. They just need to work on it. For now, however, I would consider something else."
5,"awesome band, awesome cd","i was hooked to the cd from the first time i listened to it, give it a chance and listen to a song or two a few times, i love it! I listen to it in my car every day. The band sounds great, the lyrics are so down to earth, real, uplifting, and clean. They should be talked about more than they are. *****"
2,Maybe I just get bored too easily...,"Big surprise, there is really nothing in this album that hasn't been heard before. Sure, I wouldn't say this album is bad, but it just feels very neutral. It's melodic modern rock. That's basically all there is too it. Right now you could turn on the radio and within 15 minutes find a song that this band resembles. Needless to say, you'll feel like you wasted time if you manage to listen to the whole CD."
1,boring,This album is the worst christian album i've ever experianced.My cat can make better noise screeching and meowing.Don't waste your money or your time.Save yourself the embarrassement.
2,"If you like it like it, but I wish they werent formed","if you like it, i can see why, and theres really only one reason im saying i dont like it. If it were released two years ago i just wouldnt care about it. I dont however like the fact that it was released now. Cuase now is the time for bland bands that take up to much space, and poser bands. P O D, incubus, sum 41, trustcompany,12 stones, and hoobastank are taking up too much space. There's too many bands that all sound a like. So if you like it realize i dont hate it-i just hate the idea of it. DOnt get mad-chill out- get off my case"
2,Boring....,"First I am not much of a fan of this style of rock, but I decided to pick this up anyway. The songs on here sound too similar and just seem kinda mediocre. At least there are great lyrics on this cd. Well I am a dissapointed with this release, but it the band seems to have potential. Hopefully on the next cd they can have more screaming and heavier vocals to help things out. This cd is great for fans of Creed and Pillar, but fans of heavier metal acts will most likely be bored with this."
1,Corporate Rock Manure,"Seriously folks, this is 100% diluted post-grunge Rock manure.This is why Rock music today is so uncreative and unimaginative.Stop producing music like this and stop playing this on the radio."
4,"Honest and Heartfelt, Plus It Jams!","I actually picked up this CD at the Christian Bookstore in my hometown and even though the band is not labeling themselves as a Christian band, they do express on their website that they want their songs to be positive in nature.It is quite refreshing to have a band as talented as this take real issues and to convey them in a positive manner. I would recommend reading their biography on their website. It gave me a greater appreciation of who they were as people and as artists.Outside of the messages conveyed in their songs, the musical talent of the band is incredible. They are a little Creed and a little Incubus and I would recommend picking this album up, you will not be dissapointed."
3,nuthin' great.......,"There really isn't much to say about this band. I must reject the constant comparisons to Creed because it is such a ridiculous comparison. In fact, I listen to ""Broken"" and find it to be a bit punky. I'd picture them touring with like Box Car Racer (which for a punk band, is not bad at ALL) before Creed. The reason that the comparison makes no sense is because the singer can actually sing, and the music, while being nothing out of the ordinary, is better sounding than Creed's. So, basically, if you like guitar-driven rock (not metal, ROCK) but have high expectations for music as I do, you will probably find this CD average like I do. While this isn't [bad] nu-metal and it isn't annoying or talentless, it's also nothing to drool over."
4,An Old Sound in the New Age...,"There is no doubt that 12 Stones has the potential to emerge as one of the best new bands on the market; they have all the key ingredients. This is an amazing debut album, definetely one of the most underrated on the market today. My first listen to the cd left me amazed. The music and vocals weave together to provide a pleasurable listening experience for anyone interested in the recently emerging rock style. However, after listening to the cd a few times, I got tired of it. Many of the songs sound the same, not to mention that I realized I had heard the same sound from teh like of Creed, etc. before. This cd is definetely worth a listen, however, as it is a presage to what may be a great young emerging band."
5,12 Stones deserves more respect,"This is one of the absolute stellar CD's that I own. The Tracks ""Broken"" , ""The Way I feel"", and ""In My Head"" are a few that spring to mind,as my personal favorites when I think of this CD. The ability they have to produce a soft, melodic rock sound one second and then break out into intense screaming with heavy guitar riffs the next second is absolutely amazing. I have caught myself constantly listning to this CD, then going to work singing the songs to myself. 12 Stones has a unique sound that I have really grown to appriciate with so many ""here today, gone tomarrow"" bands that have flashed before us in the last 10 Months.They deserve more respect on MTV, MuchMusic USA, and any other Music Television channel thats promotes Rock bands. Hardly ever have I seen thier videos on, it is too bad for all of them because they are missing out on some of the best new musicians of the Year."
2,"good, but they are boring","They all sound the same!!!!! The group is talented but they dont have any new beats of background music, just new words. I bought this cd because i liked the song, ""the way I feel"" and also number 1...i forget what it is called. It was a major dissapointment and i wish i hadn't bough it. Take my advice and buy a cd that you will listen to over and over...like one of linkin park's or simle empty soul. Hope this helps."
3,An ok band,"Well i burned this cd because a friend said it was a good cd, but I realized that Creed did there Cd, and lets say im NOT a Creed fan. So I burned it and the first 2 songs are ok and I would put them as a rock but what I liked was that there whole music wasn't based on Christian rock. They're good. If you like this kinda of music I would get this cd- ""this kinda music would be creed & POD"""
5,Great Band Great Album,"This CD is brilliant! Every Track is Spot-OnIf you like Bands Like Slipknot,Cradle Of Filth etc This Band or CD is'nt for You If you like Hard Rock Music You will love this!!Get This!"
3,"Not really into just plain alternative rock, but this...","This is good. A great CD. there alot of good songs on this disc. I can't really compare it to much to the musci I listen too, but I do recommend this for anyone who likes alternative, or rock music. This is a must buy for any christian rock fan or just a music fan in general."
5,An Awesome debut,"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT THIS CD IS AWESOME. EVEN THOUGH ALL OF THE MEMBERS ARE CHRISTIAN THEY DON'T CONSIDER THEMSELVES A ""CHRISTIAN BAND"".I THINK THAT IS REALLY COOL BECAUSE EVERYONE, NOT JUST CHRISTIANS CAN BE ABLE TO HEAR AND LIKE THEIR MUSIC. EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT REALLY RELIGIOUS OR CHRISTIAN, I REALLY ENJOY THIS ALBUM. I WOULD DEFINITLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE, WHETHER THEY ARE CHRISTIAN OR NOT. 12 STONES LYRICS ARE REALLY BEAUTIFUL, PAUL'S VOICE IS GORGEOUS AND ERIC'S GUITARS ARE DRIVEN. ""BROKEN"", ""HOME"", ""THE WAY I FEEL"", AND ""IN MY HEAD"" ARE WHAT I THINK ARE THE BEST SONGS ON THIS CD. SO ALL OF YOU GO OUT AND BUY IT!..."
5,An awesome Christian band with great lyrics and music!,"This is a note to the person who is saying that 12 stones is a poser group:Get a life! Groups like this are cool! I agree somewhat that alot of these groups sound alot alike but we need more music like this, I'm sick of music that is downright depressing.Anyway, next subject:This album rocks! I love Christian music, because it is awesome and just straight out cool! If you are looking for a Christian group that sounds like the following groups:Nickelback, Hoobastank, Staind and Drowning Poolthen 12 stones is your group, plus its a great Christian alternative to those language filled groups (Hoobastank doesn't curse which I am happy about) I really recommend this CD! Its awesome and the lyrics are very spiritual and downright awesome!"
3,Could be better,"I thought the 12 Stones album had a lot of great tracks on it, however a lot of the music was rather redundant and it sounded a lot like all the other metal bands out today. I think the album as a whole could have been a lot stronger if there were more songs such as ""Running out of Pain"" on it. ""Running out of Pain"" was by far the most unique and best track on the album. I was also disapointed to find out that ""Let Go"" from the Daredevil soundtrack was not on this album. ""Let Go"" is how I first heard of 12 stones and I expected the album to have more songs like ""Let Go"" on the album. So if you are looking for another metal band just like everyone else out there then I would recommend buying this CD, however if you are looking for a little diversity then I wouldn't purchase the 12 Stones album."
1,"No, please no....","If nu-metal wasn't bad enough, now we have the new wave of ""melodic, sensitive"" rock that all the teenieboppers will absolutely love. 12 Stones are nothing more than a rip off of Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains, but at least 12 Stones isn't as self-indulged (well not yet anyway) as Creed. Speaking of Creed, it seems to me Wind Up records is trying to do the same formula that helped Creed sell 20 million albums, and with Wind Up's lineup of 12 Stones, Creed, Drowning Pool, and a few others, it seems the radio airwaves will be muddied up for some time."
1,hey,ok this cd is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.even though i havent heard it but it looks stupid and its not on mtv so it must be stupid!
4,A Solid debut!!!,"So this is 12 Stones. Well, I found out about them from ""Bring Me To Life"" by Evanescence, and this surprised me. These guys prove that Christian rock can be heavy metal. Though all songs sound a bit similar, there is a different feeling felt by each one. My favorite songs are Crash, The Way I Feel, and Open Your Eyes. McCoy is a good hard rock singer, and I like his growls in the songs. I suspect that their second album, coming out soon, called Potter's Field, will be even more successful. But this is a good group, with Christian meanings and rock music. Gotta buy it!"
5,"12 Stones, 5 Stars","12 Stones CD is awesome. I love them. Good hard rock with Christian Lyrics. Good Guitar and Bass Riffs, solid drums, and awesome vocals by Paul Mccoy.Best Songs:BrokenOpen Your EyesFade AwaySimply Awesome CDPLus they are really nice guys (met them twice) and put on a good live show"
1,"Weak songs, weak vocalist, and a waste of money","I spend a lot of time listening to all types of rock, and for me i have a set list of ingredients that produce my ideal sound. I appreciate that everyone else does too and that someone might actually like this album, but who would? This band has some very weak melodies, the singer has nothing in his voice its so damn bland, for instance compare him to scooter ward from cold (You'll see what i mean) I bought this cd without even listening to it, god how sick did i feel when i heard it!! there seems to be lyrics lifted everywhere and song titles to. The only people i can imagine listening to these guys are maybe teens who are just getting into rock music, let me just say to those, there are better places to start!"
3,Lap top case,I bought this case thinking that I might use it some day for traveling. It is a nice case but a little too small to put everything that I need.
4,Good product,"Lens are really good. The only thing I don't like is that you can see wide angle lens black corners on the picture when camera's zoom is completely opened. But this might me common on all lens.The other products are ok, but their quallity is not the best... and I don't think that tripod may hold my camera safelly. They should provide a bigger one."
2,Fairly Bad,"Silly that this should be on two tapes; it's filmed in EP mode and niether tape takes up more than a fourth of the spindle.The video quality is fair to poor, the quality of the soundtrack is poor. The soundtrack itself is very annoying.Of the two tapes, #2 was much better. Both tapes have women basically dancing, etc., but the women in #2 were generally better looking.They appear to me to be all natural, which is a plus; and I think most of them are amateurs.Overall, pretty lame though."
4,Good introduction to sound synthesis,This is a lucid explanation of sound synthesis on computer. However the source code and sound samples are no longer at the web address given in the book. Also some of the math suffers from poor proof reading. Example on page 145 book says sin(PI * t) + sin(1.01 * PI *t) = sin(1.005 * PI *t) * cos(0.01 * PI *t). The answer should read 2 * sin(1.005 * PI * t) * cos(0.005 * PI * t).
3,Collector's Beware,"If you want to get this CD because you want a copy of Louie Louie with the crowd noises dubbed-in and the great introduction: ""Here they are, the fabulous Louie Louie boys....""(as it is presented on the LP) don't bother with this selection. This CD offers the original release without the dubbing--and this is a disappointment. The crowd noises create a nice varient to this classic song, and you probably have it without the dubbing elsewhere in your collection. The rest of the material is perhaps more nostalgic than exciting--although the CD does have its moments."
4,"Okay, let's give it to 'em, right now!","This was the first album by the Kingsmen, featuring ""Louie, Louie"", the all time garage band classic. It is supposedly a ""live"" album, but it's really a studio album with applause dubbed in. There is one other hit besides ""Louie, Louie"", that being a cover version of the Motown classic ""Money"". The rest of the album features a mix of group originals and cover versions of recent hits. About half of the album consists of instrumentals. This is a solid garage band album from the group that started the whole garage band thing."
3,"Alas: No ""live"" Louie Louie","Why didn't Sundaze use the version of Louie Louie with the audience sounds edited in--as the original LP did?We have the standard version of LL all over the place; it would have been nice if Sundaze would have used the ""live"" version."
4,Financial Peace,This is an excellent product to help people with their finances and establish a budget. Dave Ramsey has a great plan to help people get out of debt and stay out of debt. This should be required reading for all young people entering adulthood.
4,practical,I like the way this book is organized. It is a nice practical guide to increasing control over finances. I would recommend it.
5,Great Book!,This is a great book and really puts things into perspective for you if you're in debt like I was.
5,Great new start!,This is a great start to a new way of thinking on budget planning. I am working hard to cut out the clutter in my bills and mind to get it together!
4,Gift,"I bought this as a gift my daughter, as a referal from my financial advisor also my son, said it would help her."
4,good book,this book is a good starter book for people who have no clue as to what to do to save for a future.
5,Great for anyone!,The book covers it all from where you need to begin your path to finacial freedom to where you will end after your journey is over. Dave Ramsey takes what most people see as a complex and complicated process and reduces it to terms that anyone can understand and follow. It is a proven method and one I intend to use in my own finances.
4,Helping me control my spending,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a little dated. I bought this book along with Financial Peace Revisited, and I found this one to be more helpful. It is just the basics/outline of the book, but he actually gives examples so you can build your budget worksheets, which i found really helpful.Having said all that, I highly recommend the books to anyone that doesn't have a written budget. I thought I had one, albeit in my head, but it turned out that I had no idea where our money was going. I was in shock when I really started tracking our spending and found that we were overspending in areas we didn't need to. Now we use cash and our debit card, instead of our credit card and I feel I'm in much more control of our money. One of these days we'll be out of debt..."
4,Good alternative to a regular wallet,"I got an iPhone shortly after buying this so I don't *really* need the organizer and calendar, but I'm still more apt to pull the organizer out to make a note or write down a product I see than make a note on the iPhone. I bought a small pen to fit in the holder and found that it was very difficult to get any change out with the pen in, but that's really my only complaint."
1,orangely DISGUSTING,this was absolutely orangy AWFUL>>>>>DIGUSTED W/IT...beyond awful....extremely disappointed.....was going to send it back...but why bother i thought --i'm too ticked off..and threw it out.......need a bronzer type--not orange!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,THIS STUFF ROCKS,THIS STUFF ROCKS!!!!!! IT GLIDES ON AND DOESN'T FEEL GREASY AT ALL. IT MAKES YOUR SKIN LOOK GREAT TOO!!!! IT ALSO HAS SPF 15 IN IT TO PROTECT YOUR SKIN FROM HARMFUL RAYS.
2,Great company to do business with!,The company was great about receiving the returned item. They issued my refund promptly. The product was the wrong tint color for me so I did not get a chance to try it but given the chance for the correct color I would do business with this company again in a heart beat. :)
2,Old?,"Previously I had purchased this from a Ritz-Carlton Spa. When I received the one I had ordered through Amazon, it was so hard to open that it burst the seam on the back end of the tube and I have to use it that way. In addition, it has a different odor than before which makes me wonder if it was an old tube and that's what caused the cap to be practically sealed shut."
2,So disappointed,"I've been using this product for a number of years & just loved it.Since they've changed from the pump bottle to the tube they have obviously changed the moisturizer, now it is thin & does not cover well at all. So I am in the process of finding some other tinted moisurizer. What a bummer. Look at the dates of the previous reviews!!!!"
2,unrealistic sizing,"these size small underwear are small enough for a five year old child to wear them, just so you know. I am a size four, and they are way too small for me."
1,Rip off.,"This product sells for one third the price at the DaVinci home page; I assumed I would be getting three bottles, as I would if I ordered the Torani syrup. They add a tiny tin of mints. Not worth it AT ALL."
2,Sugar Free French vanilla Syrup,Do not like the taste of this product. Wanted Vanilla and was talked into French Vanilla. Definitely a different taste. I still haven't adjusted to it. sorry I bought it.
3,Good for personal use,This archive box serves my modest purposes as an amateur photographer. I'm trying to scan and then archive many old negatives. If I fill this box I will most likely buy another of the same. The only real drawback is the cheap hinge system- just molded plastic connecting the parts. But since I don't expect the hinges to get frequent use I'm not really concerned with the possibility of them wearing out.
3,Broken again,"My kids and I love Geotracks because the remote, tracks and trains is easy for both my two year old and four year to use. There are also many great accessories at reasonable prices. However, the first train we bought had to be returned, the battery compartment was broken. Two weeks later (after we threw the box away) the train does not always work. It acts as if there is a short or the wires don't connect quite right. The remote on the second train stopped working Christmas morning (less than one hour of play). Now I have a ton of track and accessories, two trains that don't work and a very sad little boy."
3,This one broke too.,Along with the numerous other reviews we have had nothing but problems with this and 2 other different trains with remotes. Trains begin to slow down as if it were a battery issue. Not a battery issue. Keep replacing batteries hoping it will fix itself but now after reading all the other bad reviews I will begin contacting Fisher Price for some possible remedy.
2,remote Broken,"I like geotrax and I'm building all the set. I bought this train because price and the light, and it was excellent. but a week later the remote started to fail (no sound) and a week later the remote started to drain the batteries in one night. bad quality!"
4,Good Helmet,"This is a pretty nice helmet overall.Overall - 7/10Appearane - 8/10Protection - 8/10Comfort - 6/10The helmet does everything it should... Protects my head from crashing... I haven't crashed yet, so I'm just going off appearance. It looks and feels sturdy enough.It has an aggressive, satisfying look to it.It fits on my head nicely, with a rear adjuster to get the helmet to fit snug. The ventilation keeps my head cool. The bad thing about this helmet, though, is the chin straps. As previously mention in other reviews, the straps don't lay flat against your face like they should. Though this is annoying, it's not distracting or uncomfortable enough to make this helmet a bad one.If you're looking at buying this helmet, I say go for it. It's affordable, sturdy, cool looking, and comfortable (save the chin straps)."
5,Giro Indicator,"I got this helmet right before going on a bike trip. The helmet is easy to adjust and is comfortable to wear (unlike the helmets I remember growing up). Throughout the 6 days of biking, I never had any discomfort or problems with the helmet - I am very happy with it."
5,Nice Helmet,Very nice helmet for the price. Shipped quickly and arrived sooner than I expected. Very pleased.
5,Fits my needs perfectly,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a helmet since I don't ride a whole lot. This helmet seems just right: comfortable, very light, simple to unclip and easily adjusted for fit, at a great price. Can't speak to the effectiveness of its protection, I'm hoping not to put that to the test..."
4,Nice Helmet,"Helmet fits nicely and is light-weight. As others noted, the chin strap is twisted and I'm not sure I'll be able to fix that due to the construction of the helmet. Also, the visor is too short to be very useful. One nice thing is that I'm easily able to wear my hair in a ponytail with this helmet -- huge plus for me. All in all though, good helmet for the price. Looks much better on than my last helmet."
2,one size fits all is a Large or XL.,"I usually wear a Medium helmet. When I tried on this helmet, which is classified as a one-size-fits-all, my head was swimming in it. I realize you can adjust it, but an adjustment is supposed to me minor corrections. It's my opinion that this would not be a safe helmet for anyone requiring a Small or Medium size helmet. Returned the helmet and purchased a Bell Array in Medium, which is a perfect fit."
4,Solid and Attractive Product,"Get this helmet for a great price at Amazon, rather than spending the same (or more) money for the off-the rack Brand X at the local department store. The fit was a bit snug, but I've got an ample-sized head. And true to Giro's word the helmet is very adjustable. Great variety of colors makes means that your helmet won't look like everyone else's; you'll look cool."
3,Bike Helmet,It works or I would not be here answering your questions. It is adequate for what it is suppose to do.
5,It's Giro or Nothing...,"Well, I just love these giro helmets. They meet my biking needs entirely and I can say that with pride since this is the third helmet I've bought from Giro. More bang for the buck. Giro is surely the way to go."
4,Solid Helmet,"This helmet is pretty nice looking and solid for the price. I'm sure that it's a pretty sturdy helmet that actually works because I read an Amazon review from someone that was hit by a car and had his head slammed against a curb (or something along those lines) and only suffered a concussion. He said the helmet was cracked and that doctors couldn't believe that he didn't crack his skull due to the hard impact. That review gave me confidence when buying this helmet so I suggest you go find that review and read it yourself! Thankfully, I haven't had the opportunity to put the helmet to the test :)Have a safe and happy ride!"
2,Universal fit = too small,"Either I have a really big head or the ""universal fit"" title is a bit misleading. Probably going to have to sell it and buy a bigger one."
2,uncomfortable,Bought the helmet about 2 weeks after getting my new mountain bike. First and far most the helmet is uncomfortable it pinched my head from the top there's no padding there. I read some other reviews seems giro is notorious for that they fail to put padding at the top I returned it immediately. For short rides im sure its fine but I ride for hours and I don't want to be uncomfortable the whole way instead I went with the bell variant a lot more padding and supposed to be great on safety.
3,Good for the price,"For a $30 helmet, it seems good enough. The size can be adjusted for both the chin straps and the back of the head. The only knock I have on it is that the extra pads that come with it don't stick well at all. They even fall out when I am wearing the thing (not sure how that happens). I ended up super gluing the remaining pads inside the helmet."
5,Perfect for a helmet,"I don't really have anything to add about this helmet except for the visor comes off if you want it to, and it's pretty comfy."
3,Nice helmet. A little big for my head,"I bought this helmet for my mountain bike rides because I really like Livestrong stuff and because Giro makes good helmets. The only problem I had with it is that it is too big for my head, so I had to give it to a friend. I have to say that I am 5'4"" and I usually wear small sized stuff."
4,Worth you life.,"It may not be the best looking helmet, but it'll protect you like any other. And for the price it can't be beat."
4,"Good fit, good protection.","I bought this helmet for the fit and the price. Two weeks after I bought it, I took a flip over the handle bars of my mountain bike, and landed full force on the top of my head. Although my neck suffered a bit from the compression, the helmet did a great job of protecting my skull.Since it is recommended to replace the helmet after a significant crash, I purchased the same model again.The only drawback is the ""mushroom"" look, due to its width. However, in this price class you'll be hard pressed to find a better looking helmet."
4,Great fit,"This Giro helmet is a great fit, easy to adjust for correct snug fit. Good breathing paths too. Happy buyer here."
5,Happy with the purchase,Nice helmet for the price. The local sports store had this helmet but not in the color I wanted (want it to match my bike). Found it on here for cheaper. Fits well and is easy to adjust. Put the little blue foam pads it comes with inside for a more comfy/snug fit. My only gripe is the chin strap doesn't sit flush against the ears. It's a little annoying at first but you'll forget about it sooner or later.
4,Nice product,"Easy to use, reasonably priced. My only compaint is that the chin strap seems to be twisted. I thought at first I just needed to untangle it, but it seems to be a design flaw. There is no way to straighten the strap out where it would lay on against your head."
4,Helmet review,It is a lower end price Giro but works well for my cycling. I've not seen the need to pay $200 for a hat.
4,Nice helmet for the price,I am not an expert on this type of helment as this is my first purchase for this style of helment but it seems pretty nice for the price. I would but it again.
