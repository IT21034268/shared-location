1,Useless - do not buy!,"This product is useless. The pump broke after 1 week and the entire thing started to rust after not more than 2 weeks of use. Do not buy this product; you're throwing away your money!I'll reiterate:1) the pump breaks, yielding the thing useless2) it will rust after just 2 weeks and won't stop3) do not buy"
2,Would not recommend tumbler,"We purchased two of these ""stainless steel"" tumblers to replace plastic bathroom cups. We were looking for something that was not made of plastic and we did not want to waste paper by using disposable paper cups. The cups look great when you first get it, but they both began rusting after several weeks, especially under the lip of the cup."
4,Finally a full-size tissue box,"I've looked everywhere for a full-size tissue box. None of the major chains, Linen's & Things/Bed & Bath/K-mart... seem to carry these though the stores continue to sell full-size tissues. I love this tissue box. Has a good weight to it so it doesn't slide around. It doesn't cover the family size tissue boxes and there's no bottom to it so the cover just slips over the container. That said, I'd still highly recommend this product."
2,"Attractive, but it rusts","This cup started to rust right away, the very first day. Rust marks are hard to remove from a sink -- so use it in a dry area only!"
5,Bargain Hunter,I have been through various soap dishes with none working the way I wanted them to. At last the perfect soap dish. My bar of soap no longer sits in a gunky mess and I can dump out the water underneath. I highly recommend this product. Thanks Amazon.
1,There is a much better product.,"I bought both this product and the Waterfall Soap Saver by Jobar. I find the Waterfall Soap Saver to be a much better product but unfortunately, at this time, I see it is not available. After buying the Waterfall Soap Saver, I would not use this product. Please see my review on the the Waterfall Soap Saver.There are a number of problems with this product. It is made of metal and I would not use it on my counter-tops because I am concerned with scratching. It says it is made of stainless steel but it appears to be chrome. Because of the other reports of rusting with this and other ""stainless steel"" bath products, I suspect it is not made of stainless steel or it is made with a very poor grade of stainless steel. The design requires constant cleaning.In summary, buy the Waterfall Soap Saver instead. Ask Amazon to re-stock it."
1,don't buy it,"I thought since this was stainless steel it wouldn't rust, but it did, i just threw it out today after using it for only a couple of weeks. Waste of money!!"
4,Sturdy and nice looking yet may have small leak,"My only complaint is that it appears to have a small leak - however, I believe that is due to the consistency of the soap I use.Overall, it feels sturdy when pumping and looks great on the counter top."
4,Inexpensive & Stainless Tumbler,"CUP/TUMBLER REVIEW: I was a little skeptical about buying this cup after reading about the rust stains in previous review, but I figured at such a cheap price, I'd buy 2 and see for myself.After some experimenting, there have been no stains or rust. I wash the cups in the dishwasher. One thing you have to know about stainless steel is that milk and fruit juices can tarnish the metal (you can scrub-off the marks). To be spotless, just rinse cups before putting them in the dishwasher & you'll be fine. The picture seems to indicate the cup is 2-toned, darker inside than out, but it is shiny stainless throughout.The only drawback is that there is no rolled lip on the cup, and the top drinking edge can feel a bit thin & ""sharp.""But for the price, I'll order a few more for my kids -- they won't break or leach chemicals!**** I purchased these cups a second time and to my delight, the rim is rolled & comfortable to the mouth. Add another star!!"
2,rusting after 3 months;,"I have to agree with the other reviewers It is a beautiful looking dish, but it is advertised as being stainless-steel with ""18 percent chrome for corrosion-resistance"". It is claimed that ""the Basic Collection offers durable long lasting product for a great price""That is completely false... my dish starting rusting in several spots 3 months after I purchased it, and it has now spread, 5 months out. If they're going to make a soap dish, it must be the same quality as the stainless steel in kitchen sinks: It can't rust, PERIOD. Anything less than this basic criteria is not an acceptable ""stainless steel soap dish.""In view of the above: 2 stars."
1,This is a piece of junk,Buyer beware. This item is junk. The cheap plastic pump put out a dribble and the quit. I should have read the other reviews before purchase. I'm surprised Amazon continues to sell this after so many negitave reviews.
1,It Rusted,I hadn't even had it for 6 full months before it rusted. I'm disappointed. Especially since I have an identical one that I'd bought years ago that has not rusted. Guess they don't make them like they used to.
1,Definitely NOT Stainless,Had them less than a year and had to chuck them after they left horrible rust marks on the counter. They are definitely not stainless steel (probably galvanized).
5,"Heavy duty, shiny and sleek!","The overall low rating for this product is due to the soap dispenser, not the Steeltek Basic 18/8 Stainless Rectangular Tissue Box ... why are all these different products rated together?Anyway, I wanted to let everyone know that the tissue cover is perfect! Heavy duty, shiny and sleek. It covers most tissue boxes, but works best with store brands, which generally have a shorter box than name brands.So, buy the tissue cover and forget the soap dispenser, already!"
4,Manly steel tissue box cover,"The reflective cover has good weight, looks manly & keeps my Kleenex box firmly planted. Also can be used as a mirror, self defense or to signal rescue aircraft in case of emergency."
3,steltek q tip contianer,too small. most packages of q tips are boxed as 500. container holds 300.well made. attractive.
1,Better off using plastic,"I used this dispenser for 1 week. After one day, the top started rusting because the soap dripped on it. I washed and scrubbed it out. The day after....MORE RUST. It is by far the worst item I have ever purchased for my kitchen."
4,Really like it,"It's the perfect shape and size, but I wish it came in a brushed steel. It's a little too shiny."
1,Fails to pump and top does not attach to base,"I would rate this ZERO but that option is not available. The weight of the stainless steel is heavy, exactly what I had expected for 18/8. However, the top does not affix to the base. It seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base. Furthermore, the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base. That's worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter. Yuck!I do NOT recommend the purchase of this product."
4,steel cups,"I bought 6 of these as cups for the kids. They work well. At least one of them has a small brown discoloring on the inside bottom. I'm concerned it might become significant corrosion over time. For now, it's fine."
4,Okay,"The soap pump was exactly what I ordered. It's a nice addition to my stainless items in the kitchen. However, I noticed a small bit of rust on the base the other day. So, I wipe it down everyday to avoid rust. Otherwise it's a great value."
2,Rhode Island Review,"I ordered two boxes. One had a 3/4"" scratch on it. When I used Windex to clean, it cast a smokey brown patina on it that I can't get rid of. No cleaning instructions or instructions on how to return item if not satisfied."
5,Steelin my vote!,I absolutely love my Steeltek Q-Tip container. Adds just that extra hint of refined pizazz to my sterilized/doc office motif in the bathroom.
2,RUST on bottom appeared after first use!!!,"I was disappointed by this toothbrush holder after putting it to use for just one day - any drops of water that run down the side of the holder or end up around the bottom edge due to splashing/runoff from the bathroom sink immediately seem to trigger the bottom of the holder to rust! I tried to keep the splashing to a minimum but this thing started leaving a rust-ring on my bathroom counter within a couple days. I still use it since it's a nice-looking & easily cleaned toothbrush holder but I keep a coaster under it to protect the sink/counter. I wish I could give it more stars since I love the look & functionality of it but I have to give it only 2 stars since I think making it rust-proof is only common sense for something that sits next to your sink. I wonder if all the steeltek ""stainless-steel"" products rust so easily???"
1,"All hat, no cattle","This dispenser is made of heavy-gauge brushed stainless, and looks and feels great. Unfortunately, it won't pump soap.The pump head is made of plastic, and feels flimsy. After using for about a day, it apparently began to ""lose it's prime"" and would only dispense soap after pumping repeatedly. Eventually, it wouldn't pump at all, and I returned it.Another example of a potentially-great product ruined by corner-cutting."
1,Very poor lid construction and unworkable pump.,"While attractive, the pump works poorly and the top does not screw properly to the bottle. I constantly found one side popped up because the innards of the pour spout are too low, preventing a proper fit when screwing the lid back on. After removing most of the offensive ""innards"", the top now sits properly and to use it, I just remove the top and POUR my soap. Why? Because it's still attractive sitting on my sink and pouring rather than pumping is no biggie"
3,Maybe I'm too picky...,"The item arrived with small scratches and pocks. The chrome finish is a little grainy when you look closely. Otherwise, it is exactly what you would expect - a heavy, chrome-plated, stainless steel piece that stays in place when you need a tissue. It would a good idea to add little silicon to the bottom so it won't scratch the counter. The fact the only other rectangular chrome-plated tissue cover was over $100 made it easy to forgive minor flaws."
5,Great,"There is a lot of other reviews so I'll make mine short and sweet. Has just about everything your body needs and a little more. Has the best overall variety of ingredients I've found and is far cheaper than other brands. I've felt great taking them and noticed an overall improvement, mentally and physically, over the other brands I've taken. The pills are a little big, and kind of have an pungent smell. But, as long as you don't spend your time staring at them and sniffing them your ok."
5,Best Multi I have used ever,This is so much better than the one-a-day vitamins I was taking before. They are just as cheap and provide way more bang for the buck. I take them 1 time a day every morning so I had to divide all the nutrition info by 2 to get my daily dose but I think it is still enough for a day.
3,"Basic Multi-Vitamin, Nothing Special","For the price, I think this s good basic multi-vitamin. Nothing special. But, if you are an athlete, or train harder than Joe Couch-potato, then I would recommend a more robust product. While taking these, I felt my workouts were not as intense and I felt my endurance suffered. I did not have this experience when using Animal Pak or GNC Mega Mens Sport. If you just require a basic multi-vitamin, this should work for you, but if you do any kind of physical activity, such as cardio, or lifting, I would find a vitamin that is geared towards athletes."
4,Hate the taste!,"My first time buying vitamins, so not sure if it's normal for all vitamins to have a really bad taste/after taste. It's tolerable just not very pleasant. Oh, one more thing...Other reviews said their pills were straight raw material, but mine were in a plastic capsule. They must have changed things up since last year."
1,Agree with SofaBuddy,"I pulled the following right from ""NOW"" website.We currently offer our customers vitamin D3 (natural cholecalciferol) in 400 IU and 1000 IU potencies. We plan to release a 2000 IU vitamin D3 soft gel capsule, which will match the current UL. We've chosen vitamin D3 as natural cholecalciferol (derived from sheep's wool lanolin) for our Vitamin D soft gels, rather than the less effective vitamin D2 synthetic form (ergocalciferol)."
2,"Cheap enough to be worth a try, but didn't do anything for me","I bought these softgels as a supplement, and was specifically excited about the ZMA in it because I wanted to improve my muscle recovery time. After 2 weeks of taking 2 a day, I noticed no difference in how i felt or in my soreness. However, whenever I took it, a few hours later I would have a bad taste in my mouth. I stopped taking them because there was no point. I'm giving them 2 stars because they are what they claim to be and delivery of them was prompt, but they didn't do anything noticeable for me."
1,hairloss,I started losing my hair because of this product. Avoid vitamins with stinging nettle root.
1,Not Carmen Miranda,"This is the title of a Carmen Miranda, Alice Faye film but this is not the right one. It comes up with searches for the musical or the cast but this is not THAT one."
2,Sort of okay,"I bought this after discovering Apollinaire in a class. I had hoped that by having the french and english together I would get a better appreciation of the poet. But I didn't like the quality of the translation. And the format of putting the two languages on opposite pages got garbled in the digital form, so it was hard to follow the continuity."
4,Great writing. Period.,"It's so exciting to see newer authors such as Dale Bailey (House of Bones is his best), Harry Shannon (Night of Werewolf prolly best), Scott Nicholson (The Harvest) Glen Hirschberg (Snowmans Children) etc. doing wonderfully literate takes on classic horror themes without (a) losing 21st century urgency--or (b) slacking off on the ""good stuff!"" Dale Bailey is quite a writer. Do yourself a favor and try him."
3,"Good Product, no batteries required!","One major plus is that you don't have to replace the batteries. The only thing I really can say negative is you don't get a close ""shave"" or removal of the hair and you have to move it around a lot to trap the hair inside of the blade area."
3,This model is being replaced.,"This model is being replaced very soon. I just heard from John, the owner of the company (a great guy BTW), and this is what he told me. The new version will be call ""Silver Wing XL"" I believe. The unit works great, but seems to have a design flaw where the return spring fatigues and eventually breaks, thereby doing as the 1-Star reviewer said: it won't re-open on its own anymore. I've had this happen to two so far. But, the good news is the company knows of this, and seem to have a fix for it. Great company. Great people. So I sure do hope this problem is laid to rest. And when they say there's a lifetime warrenty, they stand buy it."
2,You must have to be a sasquatch,"You must have to be a sasquatch for this thing to be fully effective. I mean, it worked for me.....as in it pulled some hairs out. I don't claim to have a contingent of hair growing from my nose but I thought this would trim the few hairs I have better than the rusty scissors I found at the bus stop, instead it's pulling some hairs out and cutting some. Maybe I need to let them grow out, but as a maintenance tool it's not working that great for me. It's construction is good and it seems like a quality product, but I may switch back to those scissors."
3,Not as great as I thought,"I got this for the husband because it looked simplistic and didn't require batteries or a charger/outlet. Its small and compact, and simple to use. But my husband says it pulls a bit too much and that its kind of hard to do one-handed. It just wasn't as good as we thought it'd be"
2,Not that great,"Badly made, and not so effective, maybe better than electric, but not so great. Plastic and not metal."
1,Poor Showing,"I received the product as implied, but it did not perform as advertised. After a few days use the item would not open up without pulling the ends apart and I sent it back after the first week. Plastic parts should be stainless steel, but that is why people say you get what you pay for..."
1,Disappointed in shipping.,I would just like to let you know that this is the second new movie that I have received from you that has had the dvd lose in the package and it has scratches on the play side and I am very disappointed because it cost more to send them back than it is worth.
4,A Lot of Fun,"Bob Adamov is improving fast. His first book in the series, ""Rainbow's End"" was fascinating and fast-paced, but a little smoothing of the edges would have helped. Well, he has smoothed the edges and come out with a book that's a whole lot of fun. ""Pierce the Veil"" is a well-done yarn that gives you bad guys on Wall Street and glimpses of some of the wondrous places of Ohio. Give it a shot as the perfect summer read, or, if you are as intrigued as I am by the uniqueness of Ohio, which is how I discovered his books in the first place, BUY THIS BOOK!! Then, if you do like it, as you probably will, go back and buy the first one. It may not be as smooth, but it's a heck of a lot of fun, too!"
4,Cheyennne Indian stories,These people aren't going to be here much longer. Hearing their own stories changes how we understand the plains Indian wars.
3,"Translator, Please","This book is published in Britain and some of the terms for ingredients will be unfamiliar to American readers. For example, what is rocket? What are courgettes? I haven't read the entire book, but too many of the recipes seem to involve shelling peas or beans. I don't think that most of the markets I go to even carry peas or beans that must be shelled. In addition, the information regarding the fat and protein content of the recipes is presented in a way that will be unfamiliar to American readers. This book definitely didn't weather the transatlantic journey well."
3,Good introductory cookbook,"This book gives a good introduction to mediterranean cooking, but I found the number and variety of recipes lacking. Still, as a used book, it was worth the price. You would need additional books to get a broad base for mediterranean cooking."
1,Never in stock,"When I ordered the jacket, I was told it was in stock. A few days later I received a disappointing email stating it would not be delivered for a month, and I could not cancel the order. After contacting the company, they assured me I would have the jacket shipped to me on 2-6-09, but they said I could cancel after all. As of 2-9, the jacket was still not in stock, so I cancelled the order. I do not like receiving false or misleading information from a company."
3,Un Collage que sirve como introducción... ni mas ni menos..!,"Este libro no pretende ser practico. Sólo será útil si estas introduciendote en el tema de BP Change.Si no es así, quiza debas buscar alguna alternativa como los libros del Dr. Sheer que estan mas focalizados en temas especificos.Saludos."
4,Very good book from Paul Harmon,"This is a very good book. I am a Data Warehouse / Business Analysis Architect and one of the keys to my profession is maximizing technology in order to solve business problems. Harmon writes about how IT is a key enabler of BPM.Harmon really does a good job of documenting the importance of BPM and process redesign, rather than wholesale reengineering of processes through the implementation of ERP systems. Harmon writes about how business processes can be considered assets of a corporation. This is important. Another key thread in the book is that all processes in an organization should map back to the value propositions of the company and therefore map directly to strategic goals.Mapping all processes to the value propositions of the company is important to ensure that nothing the company does is done solely for the sake of the institution, but maps to a business goal."
2,"Very Mixed - promised lots, confused me",The first part of the book - great. The rest - same old same old from the BPR school of destruction. Read the first part and drop the rest in that old data management bucket.
3,No way as good as the Platinum XL Hair Trimmer,"I have both the Groom Mat TrimIT Wing XL and the Groom Mate Platinum XL Trimmer. The reviewer Stardreamers also has both and while he inicates in text that he prefers the Platinum XL, he gives the TrimIT five stars. On the basis of comparison, I give the TrimIT three stars and the Platinum XL five stars. Yes, the TrimIT Wing would appear to be easier to use if your looking for something to operate with one hand, but it pulls the hairs out a lot and can be somewhat painful. It does not CUT the hairs. It PULLS the hairs out. Ouch!!! This is not at all the case with the Platinum XL. Yes, the Platinum XL is awkard to use, but far more comfortable. It CUTS the hairs. The more I think about it, I'm probably being generous giving the Wing XL three stars because of the pain issue. I definitely recommend the Platinum XL over the Wing XL."
5,Best trimer,"This is the best trimmer I have used, it does exactly what it claims it will do. And no cord and no batteries with no noiseWell thought out product"
1,WARNING! DANGEROUS!!!,"I would like to say this thing is DANGEROUS. I used one on my nose and the spring broke sending part of it LIKE A NAIL GUN into my nose! Blood streamed out like I've never seen before. I was ready to call 911 but I eventually got the bleeding to stop. I just want to warn people DO NOT use this thing near your eyes, ears or nose. I was lucky that I didn't lose hearing&#65279; or eyesight (can only imagine someone using it on eyebrows or ear hair. The spike (broken spring) did sink a good 1/4"" to 1/2"" into my skin. It was a very scary experience from such an innocent looking device. It needs a redesign just to prevent the spring from shooting out if it breaks. Not worth the risk!!!"
3,trimit...no miracle,"""Trimit"" is the first trimmer I have ever bought.I wanted to avoid the battery powered type.I assume the electics go dull quickly and the batteries are always running down!Honestly the ""Trimit"" didnt work very well for me .It just didnt get the hairs!I might try a good electric or go back to the small sizzors that are made for this purpose."
1,"Painful to use, pulls out most hairs.",This device does not cut most hairs. In most cases it pulls them out very painfully. Impossible to get a close trim. Takes forever and with most strokes it cuts no hairs. I have the product and don't use it anymore.--Victor
3,Great if you like to cut one hair at a time,"High quality, but slow to use. You must hunt down each individual hair to get the job done. A weekend project."
3,Doesn't get close enough,"I have never found a circular nose trimmer that trims my hairs close enough and this is no exception. While I like the simple design the hairs at the edge of my nose still stick out after using this, so I threw it out and use the trimmer on my electric face razor, which cuts much more quickly, effectively, and short."
5,Great Purchase,"This is a beautiful book for stained glass artists. The patterns are amazing, actual size and very well structurated. In adition the instructions are detailed and the suggested colors are clearly shown. One of my favorites in my stained glass books collection."
3,Pretty good,"Just a warning -- the cord does not come off, although it is possible to unhook it (making 2 long cords instead of one big loop), so it's not great as far as choking hazards go. It does adjust suitably for eye span. I have to set the focus all the way to one side to make it work, but maybe that's just my eyesight."
2,Get What You Pay For,"Due to the fairly good reviews and good price, I purchased a class set (science teacher.) Viewing area is very small, but expected for the price. Binoculars are all hard plastic which seems brittle. Even a short drop could be devastating. Not quite as child-friendly and durable as I had hoped. The most major concern is the focus dial, which appears to do very little. When it does move, it clicks and the focus jumps slightly. You're in luck if the distance between the lenses happens to match your vision needs at any setting. Returning them all."
3,Classic misanthropic lounge tunes,"I have owned this album for awhile but have recently have gotten arround to listening to it. Mr. Parfery is a known jokester, and it shows throught out. However it's mostly a hit and miss for me, tracks I like are the Slayer which is a Peter Sotos reading, the Porter Wagernor cover Rubber Room, Race Riot, and the Hoyt Axton cover the Pusher. However I recommend purchasing it, it's a pretty fun album."
4,Eddie Money - Strong as ever,"It is great to hear new material from such a legendary vocalist. I own the new C.D. and if you haven't sampled the songs please do, because if you enjoy his older music, you will certainly enjoy this."
5,Pure 70's Rock n Roll,"Eddie Money shines again. Hard work and talent gleem from this masterpiece, what a joy to listen to. Eddie's ready and back in solid form. For those doubters, buy the CD and you will be extremely happy. "" THE MONEY MAN IS BACK """
5,Yeah!,"Oh man! This album just kicks! I saw Eddie in concert several years ago and this album sounds like a studio version of a live concert. It just grabs you with an in-your-face rock opener and just doesn't let go! Eddie slows the pace down a bit with some cool power ballads, then fires up the band again for a hard rockin' finale! I could've sworn I was back at the concert again! Thanks, Eddie, for keeping rock alive. I thought it was gone for good."
5,"Low Budget Movies, Rule!","I got this andZombie Doomsday & Another Zombie Flick Combo Pack (2 Movies / 1 Low Price)I must admit, low budget movies are starting to get very creative. They cant hide there stories behind special effects like Hollywood movies can. So I was very intriqued by these two movies story lines...and I was not disappointed."
1,Totally Unwatchable!!,"I *had* to rate this something, otherwise it would get a zero.I am a zombie aficionado and the concept of this movie gave me high hopes. I mean, really...finally something from the zombie's point of view? Sounds like a winner to me. Unfortunately it didn't live up to even the lowest of our expectations. We were HIGHLY disappointed in this flick.After this we needed to cleanse our palate with possibly the scariest movie we've ever seen, so we watched Showgirls."
4,Gift,"I ordered this film as a gift, I am not aware of the quality of this product. My son loved it and said he had to own it. If is a look at zombie films from the perspective of one who is in the process of losing his humanity."
1,High expectations?,"I don't know if the movie is too simple, or is it that the good reviews gave me high expectations, but for me this was just another B Zombie movie."
2,Bollocks,What can I say - read my history of reviews if you wanna get an idea of my tastes.....I fell asleep watching this flick about 20 minutes in. Each to their own taste - I guess.
1,Do not get this film!,"I read the reviews and decided to try COLIN for myself to see what all the hub bub was about. Yep. Big mistake. Interesting premise but the film was just too low budget to get the job done. And how exactly did the survivor group get into a house with a hundred zombies and be stuck in the middle of them? I knew I was done when the black dude fell and lost his hat during the long drawn out boring struggle with the hundred zombies and he took the time between yelling at the dead to put his hat back on. Gotta always look presentable even during a zombie attack huh? I stopped it there. And haven't watched another second, and it is now in the garbage. Sorry to those that made this. I'm sure you were in to it and serious and everything. It just wasn't any bit of good, in my opinion."
5,good text,"excellent source for k-12 teachers of mathematicsskips all the useless stuff from those books that keep being published again each yeararrived on time, tho a bit pricey"
1,rubbish,"Worst album ever recorded. Do not waste your money on this one. To give you a sense of how bad it is, I deem that it should not be rated with stars, but rather bombs. If bombs were used as the rating system, this album is certainly of nuclear quality."
1,Terrible,"Come on man, those two good reviews were written by the Mahoney brothers...this album wasn't good...at all. Please stop ruining music for everyone. PEACE OUT."
1,Garbage,"I don't recomend this album to anyone. It is full of degrading lyrics about hippies and snow. This is probably the worst album I have ever listened to in my lifetime. After listening to ""waiting for snow"" I prayed that It would never see snow again. When I saw snow again, I packed my bags and moved to Florida where I would never have to look at snow again Now I must seek psychiatric treatment to combat my snow complex. Thanks alot MAHONEYS!~Anny Mires"
4,Solid debut,This is an excellent album- defintely worth checking out! Waiting For the Snow is the best song I've heard in a long time...
1,Dismal...,"I've never understood the appeal of the Daleks. They were interesting in the Hartnell era, but the later Dalek episodes were just awful. (And yes, that includes ""Genesis."")I'm not sure who is picking the stories to be released on DVD,but whoever it is, he has some weird tastes when it comes to the Davison stories. Most of the other Doctors' DVD releases, to date, have been top-of-the-line stuff. (I'm counting the days until ""Inferno"" comes out!) But for Davison we're mostly getting the dregs. When are we going to see ""Enlightenment?"" Or ""Kinda?"" Or ""Snake Dance?"" or ""Mawdryn Undead?"" or 'Black Orchid?"" or ""Terminus?""Get with the program, guys!"
3,If you are a Dr. Who fan I revcomend buying this DVD.,"This DVD offers a bit of background on the Doctor's relationship with the Daleks. If you are a Dr. Who fan, I eould reccomd getting thjis DVD."
4,Great excitement,"Doctor Who (Peter Davidson) must save the Earth from a Dalek invasion via a time corridor. Also, he must confront Davros--the creator of the Daleks & stop his insane scheme to conquer the universe."
4,"A definite improvement on ""Destiny of the Daleks""","Better in just about every way than ""destiny"", Terry Molloy does a lot better than David Gooderson (but not quite as good as Michael Wisher in ""Genesis of the Daleks""). The plot twists and acting are brilliant and Davison is at his best here."
3,DOCTOR WHO GOES RAMBO,"This title would have been better titled ""Let The Bodies Hit The Floor"" since the body count is the highest I have ever seen in any Doctor Who adventure. That aside, the storyline is a bit of a cluster with there being many characters involved, however they drop off like flies once the daleks appear. I find something new on repeat viewings which is what I like about DW. Davros is in true maniac form and Peter Davison gives an average performance as the Doctor. This is Tegan's farewell story and she does leave abruptly in my opinion. I believe if her exit would have been foreshadowed somewhere in the middle of the story or maybe drawn out a little longer to give it more of a lasting effect on the viewer. Oh well, what do I know. I'm just a fan. I recommend this story if you are a hardcore dalek, davros, and Peter Davison fan. A very clustered and violent tale mixed in with some decent acting, I say its pretty good."
5,Great stuff,I have been using this product for about four years. Love it. It is especially good on plants that aren't doing well; it revives them almost instantly. My tomatoes love it and it revived an olive tree I almost killed. I think the plants really love the gentle bath they get.
1,Just Bad,"I made it to page 104 before I finally gave up on this turkey. As another reviewer pointed out, how is the author able to quote conversations or report personal situations when she wasn't there? Unless the author interviewed everyone mentioned in this book (most of whom are no longer with us) and recorded all conversations, it's all conjecture on her part."
4,Hard anticipation,"I picked up the first book in the library, thinking the series looked good and I needed something to keep me busy for the next week. Well, I finished the first book within hours of completing my homework. The next day I rushed to get the next book and that is how my last 5 days have been.I feel very attached to these characters and I have grieved with Abbie through all of the deaths. The author knows the situation of post-Civil War Colorado. She has done her reseach and created a family who's problems twist up my soul. Abbie although she is a wild character has grown with her different experiences. When Monte died, I could not believe it. This story was to have a happy ever after, but it ends up as a different happy ever after. I find how the book does not get into any thing scandelous refreshing. It is a nice change from many books on the selves today.From a Colorado native, my thanks to the author. She has represented our mountains very well."
4,what is left when an ugly mist of anti-semitism covers an entire town,"It starts with a murder, a lie,and a coverup to keep the lie real.The Butcher's tale reminded me of the lies, and finger pointings, believed by the masses of witches in their midst..It brings up, and out of the lighted shadow, 'blood libel', and ritualistic murder. Hatred,and untruths of christian children,being hung unpside down, their throats cut, to catch their blood, a pail, and the blood used as an ingrediant to cook passover matzoh.Long ago prejudice, and anti semitism rears it's ugly head, as friend turns against friend, and family member against family member, as the towns people rush the investigation of a butchered corpse,whose body parts are found up and down the towns river."
3,Felt like I was back in college,"The reviews of this book may lead you to expect a true-crime story. It was researched very well and and is, therefore, a meticulous examination of German townspeople at the beginning of the 20th century; but the reviews are more interesting than the book. This is not because the story, itself, is not interesting but because it is told in a dull manner.If you think, as I did, that this book will tell you why a whole town of Christians would not only believe false stories about Jews but actually make up the false stories, forget it. The author seemed to attempt to do this through his detailed examination, but I still don't know the answer. Maybe no one does.Even if I had not already read the author's preface, after I read this book I could have told you he is a college professor and had his students critique part of the book. It reads like a term paper, lots of facts but not a page turner. A very interesting story, then, turns out to be a dull book."
2,This is not the bee you're looking for,"I bought 4 light up frisbees and made one myself, looking for that perfect one for fun summer nights. This one works fine, but the lights are blinding and seizure-inducing and none of us ever want to use it since I have better ones. It has an odd size and the lip is not as easy to throw as a normal friz. It's a little heavier or ill-balanced than desireable.Do yourself a favor and get the Nite Ize Flashflight L.E.D Light Up Flying Disc. Green is a good choice."
5,AMAZING!!,"Pretty much if you enjoy being outside and like the idea of random strangers coming up to you and start asking you where you picked up your ""wicked lighted disc thing""...then go and get the Aerobie SkyLighter.Not only is it totally durable, but the batteries last for a super long time. They market the SkyLighter as something you can use in the day and night but I would really only recommend tossing it at night. Go get a 13"" Aerobie to toss around during the day and then bring out this bad boy at night. Very bright and easy to throw and catch.Everyone who sees me throwing this thing at night wants to know where I got it and to try it out. It's such a fun idea and I love the thing."
2,"Enjoyed frisbee, but light stopped working after moderate use","Only used on maybe 5-6 frisbee games. Used it lighted for 2 of these games.LED stopped working, figured it was a battery problem, but swapping the battery doesn't solve the problem. Seems to be a problem with the electrical contacts or the switch.Can't locate a warranty.If anyone has a fix, please share!"
3,It was ok,We play a lot of night Ultimate Frisbee at our church. This disk doesn't feel or fly like a regulation disk but very durable and easy to see. The Flash Flight disk we use is a significantly better night frisbee though.
3,dead battery,"Hello,This was the first light up night frisbee I have ever bought. Disappointed because the battery was dead.I will have to buy the batteries..the product has now doub;ed in cost.But to your defense..I bought more light up toys from other companies and one of them also had a dead battery.Sincerely,Cora Ludwar"
5,SIMPLY AMAZING,"NEVER HAD A FRISBEE SO EASILY SEEN OR THROWN IN MY LIFE,, LOTS OF FUN WITH LOTS OF GOOD TIMES"
1,Immediately broke.,This is the second time I've had to buy this frisbee and it refused to light up before I used it even once. Very disappointing!
5,wow,loved it - a frisbee with a light - fun at night - fun all the time!! Grandson really liked it - we all did.
5,Mummy: The Ressurection,"This book, although not a complete sourcebook, is a wonderful resource for playing a new(old) denizen of the World of Darkness; the Amenti(Mummy). This sourcebook is rich in the culture of ancient Egypt, the combination of old and new souls is fascinating, and the mystical powers of the Amenti are intriguing. The character types are a bit rough, and each one has its own drawbacks, but what can you expect from the dead? Overall, this is an excellent addition to any World of Darkness campaign, and I hope that White Wolf does it justice by coming out with suppliments for it as earnestly as they come out with suppliments for Vampire: The Masquerade."
4,Mummies Mummies everywhere.,All and all this was a good read. lots of interesting options for Mummy characters in existing WoD games as well as a stand alone mummy game. I will admit I haven't played this game yet as my gaming group is in the middle of another game but it has peaked my groups interest.One minor complaint about this book is that it focuses solely on egyptian style mummies. which is kinda a let down but aside from that is a decent read.
3,Mummy: The Resurrection -- Okay if you're into Egyptian Lore,"It's an okay sourcebook, assuming your head doesn't swim with the barrage of Egpytian terminology and mythology it tends to shove right into your face. Some tidbits --such as the (horrific) effects drinking mummy blood has on Cainites-- were kind of neat (and _scary_), plus they revised some of the Hekau paths, Sekham cost, and whatnot, but overall, it doesn't truly carry much weight as far as my opinion goes. Some changes, like the different types of mummies and the fact that Asian mummies cannot learn Ren Hekau now (Nomeclature irrc in the revised version) were kind of needless and a letdown. However, Trabbold's artwork is nice, which is mainly why I bought the, but in the end, it just wasn't enough to hold my interest. Maybe it's more suited to your needs, but not mine, I'm afraid."
1,Not a good book,"Yes, there will be people that want to play mummies. This book, however, requires that you have a couple of other suppliments in order to understand it all. Furthermore, since this is a suppliment to a book, it practically invites crossover, and the power levels are far too skewed in the mummies favor, causing jealousy among players.In short: Do you really need this book?"
1,She Devil The Worst Meryl Streep Movie,"I love Meryl Streep and think she is the greatest living actress of today, but, She Devil is horrible and the person responsible for making it a terrible movie is Roseanne Barr. Roseanne can't act, she couldn't act in her TV series either (John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf were the only two good things about the show). Do Not buy this piece of crap, it's the worst."
2,Roseanne's character commits the following crimes:,"1. Arson2. Breaking and entering3. Computer fraud4. Identity theft5. Obstruction of justice6. Conspiracy...and she's never charged, or even arrested. Then her husband, who was sent to prison after she framed him, begs her to take him back. (His mistress was Meryl Streep, but what guy wouldn't prefer Roseanne?)This is worth seeing for Meryl Streep, and no other reason. Keep your finger on the fast-forward button -- it was invented for movies like this."
4,Revenge Is Sweet,"What happens when a dumpy housewife gets dumped for a beautiful romance novelist author? If Roseanne Barr is the housewife, she gets really hacked off and seeks vengeance. She gets really ugly about it too.The plan for revenge involves several phases. First, she manages to burn down the house. After that, she explains to the kids that they will have to live with their father since they no longer have a house; he is shacked up with the novelist who does NOT know how to handle kids. The next phase involves destroying his business and hers by getting the goods on all their dirty laundry.Meryl Streep plays the vain, self centered romance author and home-wrecker. She does so deliciously and you find yourself smirking as her life falls to pieces. I have never cared for Rosanne Barr but in this one, I found myself rooting her on.This is not high art. It is simple minded comedy with a twist of poetic justice. Don't expect too much from it but enjoy it anyway."
4,Cheaters beware,This movie is so funny and Rosanne gets to do everything anyone who ever got cheated on wants to do. She's not the devil - he is!
1,Waste of talent...waste of time...,This movie is a waste of time. I love Rosannebut her comic abilities are ignored (and she is miscast)in this silly film as it seems the plot (a jerk gets his just reward)is the only thing valued or 'allowed' to star. What a waste of talent!This is a boring stupid movie. Be sure & miss it.
4,Ok Movie,This is one of those movies either you like it or you hate it.Not a huge fan of Ed Begley Jr (especially seeing his butt in the movie) but the over all movie is good. Love Linda Hunt as Hooper she is a great actress with her dry humor and Barr is well Barr. For me it is one of those movies you watch every couple of years.
4,A Fun way to spend 90 minutes or so,"Suspend your need for logic and a coherent narrative (mostly at the end of the film)for 90 minutes and just enjoy Meryl Streep's performance. This is a fun movie, and it's a reminder that Roseanne Barr actually has some talent. Linda Hunt is a gem, but underused."
4,Funny,"I have always loved this movie, Roseanne as a psycopath wifegetting even with her husdand, this role was made for her. She Devilis very funny, and it is hard not to feel sorry for Roseanne's character.She is the ultimate ""She Devil"""
4,wacky comedy,"Roseanne Barr and Meryl Streep battle it out in the wacky comedy SHE-DEVIL.Mary Fisher (Streep) is a romance novelist who lives in a pink palace by the sea. Ruth Patchett (Barr) is a frumpy housewife with a bad attitude. They have one thing in common - Bob( Ed Begley Jr) - Mary's lover and Ruth's husband!Ruth decides to get even with her louse of a spouse, so she blows up the house, and frames Bob for embezzlement. Along the way Ruth also digs up Mary's mother in a decaying nursing home, and decides a ""family reunion"" is needed....!Based on the novel ""The Life and Loves of the She-Devil"" by Fay Weldon, this is a charming film. If you loved DEATH BECOMES HER you will flip over SHE-DEVIL.Also starring Linda Hunt and Sylvia Miles."
5,Hilarious,I was 6 when first saw She-Devil. So my love for this wonderful comedy show comes from my childhood. Unfortunately it was impossible to purchase it in Russia so it was almost 20 years when i was at last able to see my favourite movie again. Thank to Amazon. I am willing to buy all my childhood films (mostly 80s comedies). I am really happy that now i have a chance to buy all of them.By the way She-devil is great))
4,"Cheesy and awful, yet riveting...","For some strange reason, this is one of those 'b' movies that I am compelled to sit and watch every time I come across it on cable. I don't know why. I just find it highly entertaining, and somehow riveting, even though it's cheesy and awful. It's like junk food. You know you could do a whole lot better... but you once you've opened the bag of chips, you're in it for the long haul."
4,Valor RM-921C Review,"Does the job. Installed myself in 2004 Sienna. DVD tray is not in the best location and close to roof panel. Very bright and clear image at wide viewing angle. Kids love it. Sound over car stereo via built in transmitter is also quite decent, but recommend the wireless headphones."
2,don't buy,"I purchased an elph for the size and the fact it takes panaramics. At first I was happy with it, it took good pictures, was easy to load and unload, and was compact. After about 3-4 months I was in the keys with my friends when we took our last picture on the film, it would not rewind not even manually. I brought it to a camera place to see if they could get the film out and they told me to send it back to canon. The door was stuck and he did not want to ruin it. I did happen to eventually get the film out myself but the camera still did not work so I sent it in (supposively under warranty) and they wanted to charge me $75 to fix it. I suggest looking for another camera."
2,Canon Elph Z3 Zoom,"When I purchased the camera, I was impressed by its small size and the camera was easy to carry in my pocket. The camera was easy to use too. Unfortunately, the camera is poorly made, and the H light (signifying a mechanical problem) began flashing after the second roll of film. The camera lens failed to retract, and I had to take the camera to a repair shop for repairs. Buyer beware!"
2,Not worth the money,"Just as everyone else stated, this is a great compact, cool looking camera. Pictures have turned out okay. Some were blurry but I suspect it may be the lighting. Outdoor pics were clear as the sky. However, I have a lot of problem with loading and unloading the film. Sometimes the camera would keep rolling sounding like it would load the film but when it stops making noise the cartridge symbol blinks asking you to put in the film. And when it finally loads correctly and finishes rewinding the film, the door gets stuck and would not open. It's quite frustrating. I'm going to get a refund and I suggest not getting this camera at all especially for this price. You should probably go with their digital elph camera instead."
2,Canon Elph Z3 Zoom,"I bought this camera approximately one month ago. I've developed 4 rolls of film so far and I'm not at all impressed by the quality of the photos. My biggest complaint is red eyes. On almost every close up in both dark and light conditions, the subject's had red eyes. This camera suppossedly has red eye reduction...I've yet to see it produce results. I did however take some panoramic landscapes and they came out awesome. On another note, just like other people have mentioned, the camera looks cool and is small enough to fit in your pocket."
4,Great Camera,"People dont realize its not just the camera that takes good pictures, but how the person uses the camera. I bought this camera in 2002 and i still have it. It takes great pictures. I took pictures of weddings and parties and the picture came out great. People loved the pictures. Cameras do break so you do have to be careful how you load the film. The only bad thing about the camera is you have to push the button down for a second, then release it and it takes a moment to take the picture so this camera is not good when taking pictures of small children. APS film does have a disadvantage versus the 35 mm on the quality of the picture when you enlarge, but the advantage is you can get 3 different sizes which is good when you what to get a scene. Its very compact and it comes with a case."
5,Cannon ELPH,"This camera works really well, and takes great pictures. Even though you have to buy Advantex film, it is worth it for the pictures you get."
2,Disapointing,"I got this camara as a gift and liked this camara a lot although the door never closed quite right and then just a year later it broke and they want to charge me $100 to fix it! It's a good camara but badly designed. Not worth it, I suggest you keep looking."
2,it's alright,"I have had this camera for a few months now and while taking pictures it all of a sudden, it froze on me and now it is useless. I probably will have to pay more for fixing it than it is worth. I would definitely invest in a different camera."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I've taken 6 rolls of film with this camara and have been so dissapointed. The pictures are very grainy and the colors are not at all bright. I've tried playing around with the flash and making sure I have enough light, and have also tried different speed films and the photos are still very poor quality. I originally bought this camara for the small size, but will be looking for another."
1,Highly toxic to fish - Not for use near aquatic environments,"""This product is toxic to fish, shrimp and aquatic invertebrates."" And, I was hoping to use it while fishing and boating. So, it's of no use to me.Also, this is not a ""repellent"". It is a broad-spectrum insecticide. I'm fine with killing mosquitoes and other nuisance insects, but killing off every insect in the area is not good. Products with Allethrin and other pyrethroids should probably be limited to indoor use. They definitely should never be used near marine environments."
2,Sub par Jet Li flick with some decent fight scenes,"Having read all of the positive reviews on this film, I decided to purchase it since I am a huge Jet Li fan. The movie started out great and it seemed I had a true classic on my hands but as time wore on I realized what a [bad movie this was]. The story is incredibly weak and goes in a totally opposite direction than what you'd expect, favoring badly done humor instead of throwing in some sorely needed combat sequences. The fight scenes themselves are well done half the time and boring the other half. If you're a fan of Jet and want to see a well done collaboration between him and Wong Jing, check out Deadly China Hero or Lord of the Wu Tang."
4,Jet Li proves as enjoyable as ever.,"This may not be Jet Li's most exciting movie, but it does merit purchasing if you are truly a fan. If you are looking for Matrixesque Martial Arts sequences, well keep looking. However, if you are truly a martial artist or just an enthusiast, you'll appreciate the action scenes in this movie. At times, like all Chinese Kung Fu theatre, there are silly unrealistic action segments, and some of the dialogue just doesn't translate to English very well. Nonetheless, Jet Li and his ""son"" both take on their share of villians. The action sequences involving the kid are most enjoyable. Especially when he teaches a lesson to a few of his young peers and finishes in a pose of Single Whip. Real fans of Jet Li would want this movie. And, if you only know him from Romeo Must Die or Lethal Weapon 4 and you want to witness vintage Jet Li (3 time National Wushu Champion of Republic of China)then you should give this one a go."
4,Wonderful departure for Jet Li,"This is a great film. The baddie overdoes his part a bit, but seeing Jet Li play an absolutely angry individual is a wonderful surprise. He and Tse Mui, who play his son, are absolutely unbelievable martial artists. Mui steals some scenes, but never entirely, making you want to watch both of them and what they'll do next. Great film...."
1,Ignored My Order!!!,I am very disappointed!!!! I was looking forward to watching my movie sold by rivera_my. I thought it was very unprofessional an RUDE TO TAKE MY MONEY AND IGNORE MY EMAILS. TO ANYONE WHO PURCHASES cd'S fROM RIVERA_MY. BE MINDFUL AND CAUTIOUS....KEEP IN MIND NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL THE MONEY IT STILL MONEY...AND RIVERA_MY WILL TAKE IT....ALL IN ALL DON'T SPEND WITH THIS SHADY-SELLER...4 REAL!!!
1,Not a good Jet Li movie.,"Iv'e seen all of Jet's movies. This is one of the worst. Personally I dont like seeing people do supernatural things {like flyimg} when they are fighting. Some parts of the movie were Ok, but overall I found it weak. I mean Jet Li is a really great martial artists and my favorite, but this movie was pretty dumb and very unrealistic. Get Fist Of Legend, that was good.... Oh, by the way,take it from a REAL martial artist THERE IS NO KARATE IN THIS MOVIE, NOR DID BRUCE LEE TRAIN KARATE...IT IS KUNG FU!!! THE ORIGINATOR OF ALL ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS....Learn the truth, read the books, do your homework..."
1,Negative,"The movie itself is entertaining but it wasn't in english, which made it difficult to understand"
3,over the top comedy-fu,"In the opening moments of the movie, Jet Li forces his toddler son to choose between a sword and a toy. If he chooses the toy, Jet Li will kill him. That pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is just completely over the top. You'll get to see 7 year old kung fu masters, steel flame-powered hotrods, wire fu, blanket fu, metal umbrella-fu, and con artists with hearts of gold. The dubbing, so bad it's good, adds to the comedic aspect of LotRD.Best watched with a group of friends. You will enjoy making fun of this movie together."
1,The worst Movie ever made,This movie was terrible. The voice overs were rediculous. The characters where bad charachitures of the worst kung fu cleches. I can't beleive I wasted 2 hr's of my life watching this. This movie has absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. I would rather burn the money it would cost to by the movie than be forced to watch it again. To more accurately describe how bad it was I would have to use profanity in three different languages.
1,Very poor,"From a kung fu movie fan's standpoint, this is a poor movie. The actual fighting in it is all wire assisted, and the special effects are so primitive that it's laughable. There's a monster with a metal car, and these 5 shaolin monk kids that can't fight, and this woman named Red Bean who pretends her mother is dead so she can marry a rich guy. The very bad plot is impossible to follow. Watch this only if you're a jet li diehard, and if you have a free rental coupon."
4,Top rate action!,"I wish Jet Li would make more films like this one!Forget that modern day stuff!I watched this the same evening as I did the Wu Tang Clan's release of Shaolin Drunkard,which is directed by Yuen Woo Ping.Drunkard had more extras than this film,but the combo was a great one.Check them out together!"
4,Legendary Hilarity,"One of the greatest bad movies of all time, Legend of the Red Dragon defines goofy martial arts films. Some of the dubbing choices are truly bizarre, and often add to the overall humor. ""All right eat up; you kids be sure to get your potassium"" is one of my favorites. A villain at the beginning of the film actually picks up a log from a log cabin, and swings it around like it's nothing. If that weren't enough, the hero takes his ""magic spear"" and drills all the way through the log length-wise! This is just scratching the surface! If you find over the top, ridiculous action funny, pop in this movie, and have a drink or two. You won't be disappointed."
4,Review; New Legend of Shaolin,There are some excellant spear techniques.Best kid kung fu movie that I have seen yet.Movie gives good insight about the complications of a warrior or militant raising a family.
4,Good Humor and Good Fighting,"Though its not Jet Li's best movie, it is still fun to watch and the humor in it is well timed for a movie that is not a comedy. This version is subtitled with not english dubbing."
5,Be Careful! Get the right version!,"Avoid the dvd entitled Legend of the Red Dragon. This is a re-edited version of New Legend of Shaolin, dumbed down and dubbed down for us Americans. Make sure to get NLoS, it's the original classic.New Legend of Shaolin is a great flick; assuming you don't mind over the top wire-fu and a really over the top bad guy. The humor is certainly an acquired taste, but worth it."
1,Buy the ORIGINAL instead!,"Not realizing that the American distributor had decided to edit the film, (which was already edited and complete, so this is extremely rude and arrogant), I rented this one. And was a bit puzzled at some of the dialogue. Then I found out about the real version, NEW LEGEND OF SHAOLIN and had to go elsewhere to buy it. What a difference!! Not only were scenes there that had been cut from this shlocky version, but entire conversations were different!! (I use subtitling only so can't vouch for the dubbed.) It made a HUGE difference to the film, which is just plain fun."
1,Not for you if you loved him in his American premier LW4,"I fell for Jet Li after seeing him in Leathal Weapon 4.If you are not familiar with the Honk Kong type of movie style,you will be terribly dissapointed,this movie will seem obsurd and terribly staged.It doesn't give you the opportunity to really experience Jet's great talent for the martial arts,it's all done with wires and ""smoke and mirrors"" so to speak.Wait around for future ""American made"" movies starring Jet Li,there will be plenty coming since his great reception in Lethal Weapon 4.Be patient and wait,and if you can't the best thing to do is rent or buy,""Fist of Legend"",""Hitman"",or ""Bodyguard from Beijing"".These movies don't get into the silly comedy and ridiculous antics that are in this movie."
1,"This ""movie"" is an insult!","Being a martial artist myself, I loved Lethal Weapon 4. Fight scenes were clean, hard, and realistic. This disgrace was the opposite! Li has talent, so give him time. But the subtitled version of this movie is alright, so give that a shot, but stay away from the dubbed!"
2,"Unrealistic Karate guy fighting, really poor!","This movie reeked in the realm of reality! Jet Lee is a poor martial artists! Trust me, I'm a second degree black belt and this movie Karate techniques are not accurate at all. Save your money and watch Enter The Dragon, a real Karate movie with a Karate expert, Bruce Lee!"
3,Crazy Roller Coaster of a movie,"this movie looked pretty good in the begining when jet busted some skulls with a stick after seeing his house destryed. he also gave his infant son a choice to fight by his side or die.later on the movie, the story line became stupid and unbearable. a guy drives around in a spiked car? cumon, its not even the ching dynasty yet!! and he uses his son as a projectlie to throw at the big boss! no way! what saved this movie as with his other bad movies, were the fighting scenes."
2,We'll see...,"I'm not sure about this item. I am disappointed that it was sold as a new model. The package has been opened and resealed. I bought it for a birthday gift. It will be extremely upsetting if all of the parts are not in the box, or if there is damage. I will write another review of the item when the gift is received.I have decided not to give the gift, but to return it to Amazon. I did not feel comfortable giving a gift that had been opened previously and possibly damaged. I will attempt to find the same item from a different seller."
2,"Image stabilization function did not work,",I presently have a Canon 8X25 stabilization binoculars and am very pleased. I ordered another one for our daughter. The image stabilization did not work. Returned for a refund.
4,Great product for the price,There are other stabilizing binoculars that are better but they cost so much more I couldn't afford them. This one I bought for a present to some friends that were sailing off into the sunset. They rant and rave at how much they love them and how they've made spotting small items in the water so much easier! Once you've tried stabilized binoculars it's hard to use the other kind.
3,Image Stabilization only OK,"I own a Canon 10x30 IS binocular, which I LOVE. My wife wanted a lighter binocular, so I ordered the 8x25 IS. I am dissappointed in the Image Stabilization in the 8x25. I get a more stable image in the 10x30 despite the greater magnification. The 8x25 stabilization leaves a noticable shake in the image and for about the first second of activation, the image drifts slowly as the system ""warms up""(?) I tried replacing the battery and even returned the first set, but the second binocs have the same behavior. If I had never seen the larger binoculars, I would probably be satisfied (barely) with the 8x25, but after experiencing the immediate response and rock-steady image of the 10x30, the 8x25 stabilization was a definite let down. Otherwise the optics are great."
4,"Good price, excellent DVD, fast shipping!","Since I missed growing up on TV and old movies, I've been playing 'catch up' the last few years... and discovering the genre ofRay Harryhausen special effects has been a pleasant change of pace from the current 'too fast to see it' CGI movies special effects movement....(I really hate it when even in SLO MO the CGI takes place too fast to see what happened...great example, the 'coin kill' of the Accountant in Drive Angry) at least in Harryhausen's stop action claymation you get to see each movement and action/reaction!!! Very cool for its time, and nice to see Ray get his lifetime achievement award recently!!!"
5,An oldie but goodie,I remember watching this movie with my mom when I was small. When showed her what I got she was very thrilled the next day we watched it together. The movie worked great. Was shipped very fast and no damage was done through delivery. I will be buying from this seller again.
5,Review this movie before rejecting it,"I purchased this movie after reading some rather negative reviews. But I had seen this movie before, so I knew what it was like. The story is as good as any of the Sinbad stories. It has a good cast with known artists. Patrick Wayne is good as Sinbad. Of course the Ray Harryhausen effects are good, as always for the time, and the type. It's a fun movie, so don't get too serious about it. Enjoy the campiness of the genre. Yes, they might have selected a 'darker' actor for Sinbad, who is obviously an Arab, even a Muslum (references in dialogue to Allah), but remember it's a story... a movie. Just enjoy. And it is clean... no references to nudity, no cursing (you'd think the movie makers could get this one), and just good family fare."
3,As good as any current sci-fi fantasy films.......,"Maybe not so good for the old folks, but the youngsters love it. The character animation was good as well as the special effects and costumes. It was interesting to see the offspring of my two favorites classic screen idols, Tyrone Power and John Wayne. Lovely Taryn Power bears and amazing resemblance to her handsome father and was good in her role. Patrick Wayne made a good Sinbad...handsomer than his father, in my opinion, but not as good an actor. All and all, a good movie if action, fantasy and sci-fi are your cup of tea."
5,On Time,"Ordered the DVD, came in on day promised, watched it that night. Now I have all 3 adventure Sinbad's, as I still consider the 7th Voyage of Sinbad as the best, and that is my personal opinion, I enjoyed watching this adventure just as much as the other ones."
3,satisfactory,One of the well pictured Sinbad stories. Good for viewing with family. Adventure well appreciated by children.
4,Gloriously Campy,Why don't they ever play this movie on T.V.? The Golden Minotaur and his evil witch mistress steal the show from Patrick Wayne's overly macho Sinbad. Does Leonard Maltin like any Fantasy movies?
1,genuinely awful - this is one knockoff too many,"Well, this was the last film in the Harryhausen set we got, and it is the only one I found so bad that I could barely watch it. Even though Jane Seymour is in this, the acting is so bad, so stilted, so wooden, that I cannot comprehend how it could possibly be, well, so awful. The direction is also bad, with all sorts of meaingless incidents, like someone falling while walking, etc. Finally, the script is also boring and while all of these are improbably, I could not suspend my disbelief and enjoy any if it. Even my kids got bored, and it was for them that I got it. The only redeeming feature are Harryhausen's effects, which are good, but they are grafted onto such a crumby movie.Not recommended. You can't even enjoy this as camp."
1,A disastrous failure in Ray Harryhausen movies.,"This film is not a Sinbad film. Ray's special effects are very dissapointing, because he just couldn't go farther in technology at the time the film was made in. The movie went on forever and was completely boring. The only person who made it good was Jane Seymore, with a very sexy look, but everything else was just a complete flop."
4,"GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS , BUT THE WEAKEST IN THE SINBAD TRILOGY!","This was Ray Harryhausen's last Sinbad voyage. It is a shame that this didn't turn out the way Ray wanted it to. He never had a big budget for his effect and time was a big factor. Given the circumstances it is a wonderful effort! It is the weakest of the three Sinbad films, but it is still worth owning if your a fan. Ray's effects never get old to me. The DVD transfer is good,but they all deserve better."
3,A real trip,"well, the first time I saw 'Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger', I was 5 years old, home from school watching afternoon television with the smell of Vicks in my nose...and let me tell you, it really added to the already amazing special effects of this movie. I would highly recommend it... not only does it have the devastatingly beautiful young Jane Seymour, but Sinbad is quite dashing, and the monsters and scenarios are genuinely intriguing. The animation, especially on the Tiger and in the Tiger/Cyclops-monster battle scene is amazing for its time, and the man who created it must have had the patience of a saint. The movie is worth watching just for its old-style animation effects alone. Beleive me, the images of it come back in your dreams."
4,simply amazing,"I first saw Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger in the movie theateryears ago and I loved it. I haven't seen it recently,but I wouldlike to. The film kept my attention all the way through. I thoroughly disagree that the acting was bad. I thought it waspretty good myself. Frankly,if you are not into science-fictionand fantasy as I am,you can't expect to enjoy any film.Anyway,even if you don't enjoy the acting,the special effectsare terrific. For me this was a truly memorable film that Iwould recommend to anyone."
5,"Fantasy Film That Hasn't Gotten Its ""REWARDS!""","Just wanted to add that I agree with ""tall_blond_handsome's"" review completely.Harryhausen never made a lifeless film. He did more with stop-motion than any computer graphic artist has done."
4,Tony Elwood's Killer,"I saw this on late night cable tv Showtime I think many years ago and was so impressed I looked it up on-line and bought the DVD. Shot in super 8mm, a gritty realistic at times film with some very strong performances and other not so strong ones. The budget was low (around $10,000) so their are limitations within the film, however as a whole this movie is a large success. Finances ran so low that in one particular scene an actress shows only one breast instead of two because the producers could only afford to pay her pay her half of what she required to show both! The soundtrack on the DVD is far better than that on the VHS version and I would certainly recommend this DVD to any horror fan, Killer is a great addition to any true horror DVD collection."
5,great overall view of roses,"Ethne Clarke gives readers not only how to use roses, but how they've been used throughout history. Beautiful photos show fun perennial partners and combinations giving ideas of how they can be used in landscaping."
5,Must watch if you have a daughter,I recomend any dad watch this flick. If you have a daughter you will relate... Every Daddy's fear ... his daughter growing up. That is what this is about. It is hard to let go sometimes and at times we just don't know how. Tony in this movies has that problem and perhaps by watching it we may learn something. Most likely what not to do but hey.
4,She's Coming of Age -- and He's Out of Control,"This is an excellent coming-of-age story for fathers and daughters who have not been overly sheltered to watch together. It can help to break the ice about a lot of topics in a fun way. It is fun for the kids to watch by themselves, and bears watching over and over again. There is something for everyone. It is well-paced, and rich in the soundtrack of the sixties, since Dad is a DJ. Wallace Shawn is priceless as the know-it-all Psychiatrist specializing in adolescents. Catherine Hicks' (Dad's girlfriend) is very effective (and very feminine) as she tansforms the ugly duckling fifteen year-old Ami Dolenz (yes, Mickey's daughter) into something her father will never recognize."
2,She's Out of Control(1989),"Siskel and Ebert had nothing good to say about She's Out of Control(1989) starring Tony Danza and cute, sensual Ami Dolenz. It's a half way decent comedy. It's worth showing on HBO. Doug Simpson(Tony Danza) tries to protect his daughter Katie(Ami Dolenz) from boys when she goes from plain jane to knockout! There's Family Guy-style gags with Simpson looking at his daughter! Ami Dolenz looks great in a blue bathing suit! She runs on a beach in slow motion a la 10(1979). She's Out of Control also spoofs Flashdance(1983) with Ami Dolenz dancing to 'Maniac'. Catherine Hicks, Wallace Shawn, and Laura Mooney co-star."
3,Forget control...she should be out of her bathing suit...,"She's Out of Control is a great piece of '80s nostalgia. Not only do we have Ami Dolenz, an '80s heartthrob, but also Tony Danza at the peak of his popularity. Danza does get a little wacky in the movie, but that's part of its charm. There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie including the scenes with that mastermind Dr. Fishbinder. See it at least for the hot Ami Dolenz on the beach. Put it on your list if you're an '80s freak."
1,She's Out Of Control,"Tony Danza Overplays Doug Simpson, The Father Of A 15 Year Old Girl Who Suddenly Blossoms Into The Town Knockout During A Business Trip...He Returns Only To Discover A Horde Of Anxious Teenage Boys All Craving Katie (Ami Dolenz)...This Movie Follows The Quintessential Over-Protectiveness And Rebellion Of The Teenage Years...Amusing Film With Lots Of Scenes You Can Relate To, But Too Close In Concept To All Of Those 80's Sitcoms...Starring Tony Danza As Doug Simpson, Ami Dolenz As Katie, And Cathreine Hicks As Doug's Girlfriend..."
2,rather boring,"Tony Danza in his usual role as the father of a growing up daughter. The story is rather boring, while the actors do quiet an ok job. Matthew Perry is in it too, but only has a minor role. Not really an evening filler and even boring for the afternoon..."
4,She's Out of Control,I remember seeing this movie years ago and liked it. Tony Danza is really cute.
2,"Scotch is a drink, not a people!","You would think that a writer would know the proper name of the group about whom he is writing....we are SCOTS, not Scotch. Ask any native of Scotland--- they will tell you that Scotch is a drink; the people are Scots.The information in this book was very interesting and well documented, but it was tiresome to read. The author repeats himself over and over again within chapters and even within paragraphs.....restating, in different form, the same thoughts and facts.If you can get through the duldrums of the writing technique, you will gain much valuable information."
3,A nice collection of 'Dame' Donna's videos,"This is a nice little collection of Donna's videos but its not much more than that. The tape only includes videos from as far back as 1980 and the concert footage was lifted from the 'Hot Summer nights' video and to be honest I dont think that footage shows Donna at her best (I guess she must have been a bit exhausted from performing). For this to be a great collection of Donna's work it should have featured some of her early rare promos and concert footage from the 70's when songs like 'Mcarthur Park' and 'Last Dance' were new hits instead of Donna just going back over her classic catalogue. But all that said I still enjoyed seeing all the videos that were on show, most of them I had never seen before and it was great to see the new 'Melody of Love' promo. I do hope there will be another Donna video out someday and that it will be the definitive collection that I have just outlined but in the meentime this one will have to do."
4,Great Video Showcase,This is a must have collection for any Donna Summer fan. These video's showcase Ms. Summer's talent from the 70's thru the early 90's. Love that Melody of Love video...
4,Fantastic Document of Prime Godfather Funk,"Out of retirement and James busted out with this! The Video overall is an excelent document of this comeback concert. The Video quality is excelent but the camera work is definatly on the amature side. After focusing only on James the first song and a half they loosen up to the whole band. The song choice is fantastic. An incredible 20 min version of sex machine and super funky Eyesight are my favorites.All his trademark things (dance moves, cape etc..) are here and make this a great video for anyone passionate for the Godfathers brand of Aliveness Fun and Funky Funky Music."
4,"Oh, yeah!","It's not the best production. The lighting is bad. The camera work is bad, BUT the sound is great and what you get is a video shot in a dark club as it would have been. Considering what is available of James Brown, this video is must for anyone interested in knowing what James Brown is all about. He puts on a great show and it's a video you'll watch more than once. Owwwwww!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I was very disapointed. I wish this lost tape was never found.James deserves better than this. Songs are loooong drawn out grunts, the he ask if you want to hear it again.Very dark and dull lighting. 1979 was not James porforming peak. His best were in the 1960s.I wish I could get my money back."
2,"""Everyday Experts""","This production presents six individuals that have an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon. Some had purported encounters, one of the guys is accused of hoaxing, and then there's Chandra. Ok this has nothing to do with 'proving' bigfoot exists or not. What it is, is a roughly hour long documentary on 'investigators' in the phenomenon. It's a look at the variety of everyday joes that have an interest in this. It's nothing special and the 'educated expert' does nothing more than summarize Ivan Sanderson's book on classifying unknown homonids. You get a former skunk-ape hunter, current skunk-ape hunter/hoaxer, granola girl, educated expert, a guy saying he's a paraphotographer(?!) ""looks into the P/G film, and then pacifist Chandra who wants the bigfoots to study her not vice versa (she's a bit odd).Overall, nothing to get excited about and it wouldn't hurt you to save your money on this. I found it relatively boring and largely uninspiring."
3,twisted rope band,only bought it for a cheap wedding band for travel and outdoor activities in other countries it'll do
3,Good for the price,"Well I own this game and it is a fun game, and the graphics on the cars are pretty good. I only paid like 8 bucks for is new but I found a great deal. The game is pretty cool over all, only complaint I have is that the cars look like they're going slower then they really are."
3,Not meant for the PC,"I've got this one for the Dreamcast and it shines there. Easily the best racer I've played, with strong graphics, good sound, great replay value. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have moved to the PC very well.If you have a Dreamcast, pick up the appropriate version of this. Otherwise, might be worth skipping."
1,"Oh Dear, if you're sensible you'll give this game a miss","I bought this game as I had a gift voucher, I wish I just bought an audio cd instead!The pictures on the cover make it out to be on par with GT3 for the PS2 how could I go wrong I thought!I loaded the game up, to be faced with an annoying soundtrack which repeated it self, then to the game itself, the car graphics were close to that of GT2 for the PS1 but not as presice. The feel is horible and the tyre screech doesn't coordinate with the movement of the car... eg if you move the car from side to side quite eratically there is no audio feed back until it's too late.The interface between games is poor with menu after menu of huge boring looking menus, maybe I didn't give this game a chance but it's nowhere near GT2 or GT3 and I wouldn't waste your money, wait till it becomes a fiver and even then be prepared to be dissaponted.to some it up this game is utter drivel !!!"
2,"Realistic car handling, graphics are a dissappointment.","When I saw that this game came out, I wanted it. I had played it on the Dreamcast before, and at the time, SegaGT was better than Gran Turismo (that is before Gran Turismo 3 came out). All the cars is this game handle realistically, that's a plus for those realistic racing fanatics. You can play by keyboard, joystick, or wheel with not a whole lot of customizations for key configurations. The biggest dissappointment with the game is I though I would get good graphics coming over from the Dreamcast. I was wrong. Even though you need at least a 4MB video card, it's almost like playing on a Playsation One..."
2,Sega GT for PC not so hot,"This game looks great on the packaging, I read a lot of positive reviews on line. I bought the game, and LO and BEHOLD, even with a PII 300, and a Voodoo 3 video card (16MB), and 160Mb RAM, NO TEXTURES!!! All cars are shiny black, with no colors, and no textures. It looks awful! (But, gameplay is decent, and the tracks are very nicely detailed). If I could find a patch out there to fix the textures, I'd probably reinstall the game. ..."
4,I was the fifth passenger...,"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said before? Michael Paterniti is a talented, gifted writer who turned this small piece of Einsteinian history into a full-fledged book and made it a terribly enjoyable read! I was on this road trip with Michael, Harvey, Einstein and The Brain, seeing the things that they saw, living each moment along with them. Michael writes Harvey as very eccentric, quirky and elusive; so much so that I had to keep reminding myself that he is a REAL person, not a fictional character. In addition to a great adventure/memoir/non-fiction/travel book rolled into one, I got a great history lesson. One that I didn't know anything about, but am now piqued to learn more. Excellent."
4,"Honey, I have to go the west coast with an old man.","Some of the reviewers have missed the point. This is a book about THE BRAIN, but also about age, life, dreams, and continuity. It's a neat little book that says more than it says. and means more than it says. A great gift, and a thought provoking ride across a country and time."
3,Great premise...mediocre story,"Oh, I love the IDEA of this book so much more than I actually loved the book. Albert Einstein's brain is in a tupperware bowl and it is being driven across the country by a journalist. The man who performed Einstein's autopsy kept his brain, and Paterniti is helping Harvey to return the brain to Einstein's granddaughter, who is somewhat perplexed by the whole thing. It's a true story which makes it even better. Still, it was a decent summer read, and had many people commenting while I read it. I just was not so thrilled with the final product...I'm not sure if Paterniti wasn't able to tell the story so well because he was IN it, or if this is just his writing style...I wasn't in love with it. However, I do still treasure the premise, I managed to read the entire book, and I learned things, so it wasn't all bad."
5,Driving Mr. ALbert,A young freelance writer + an elderly pathologist + Einstein's brain = Intelligent humor. A must read. You won't be able to put it down.
2,Couldn't finish this one,"I purchased this book hoping for a good story with insights into the life of Albert Einstein, or at least how he affected others. What I got was a dull read narrated by someone who's sense of adventure was evidently hamstrung. The whole thing turned into a detailing of the quirks of the professor, interspersed with bits of ""wow, cool, I'm in a car with a dissected brain!"". Eating breakfast at a diner is not an adventure. Staying at motels, ditto. I waded through nearly half the book in foolhardy optimism thinking something might happen. Anything. It didn't."
2,You can tell he writes for Esquire,"This book is just one long-winded Esquire article...a topic with a catchy enough premise to suck you in, words that are put together well enough that you don't put it down immediately after picking it up, but in the end, it goes absolutely nowhere. There's no attempt to get to the heart of ANYTHING...the ""brain keeper"" his acquaintances, or the author's relationship with his wife, Sara."
2,Interesting subject but...,"Interesting subject and it's true. Who would have thought? The book didn't seem like it needed to be as long as it was, the filler interrupted the momentum of the book.Being that I live in the Princeton area my one real problem with the book is that certain facts about the area were inaccurate. The shad fest takes place in Lambertville not Lawrenceville. When Harvey moved back to NJ it wasn't to Princeton but to Titusville. Also Princeton Hospital isn't the exclusive place that the author makes it out to be, it's just your average hospital. Paterniti should have done a better job verifying his facts as should have his publisher."
2,Not great,"The book is just OK. A friend told me that inspired by the success of this project, the author got a job as a Federal Baggage Screener to write an expose of this profession (although he claims that he just wanted to be a Federal Baggage Screener), and has been doing the rounds of TV interviews (CNN, FOXNews(unfair and biased), Nickelodeon, etc) to boost sales. He's been attacked by some of the interviewers for not being straight about his intentions to write an expose (but he claims that he just wanted to be a Federal Baggage Screener.) Does anyone else know if this is correct?"
3,Intriguing story that doesn't cohere as a book,"Einstein's brain, removed from his body and bouncing around America! What a terrific symbol of...something!Well, yes and no. Paterniti has a terrific story, chronicling the adventures of Einstein's brain over the last forty-odd years. And he can be genuinely funny when presented with incongruous situations (and when you have Einstein's brain in the back seat, almost all situations are incongruous).The problem is that Einstein's brain doesn't do much, and Paterniti doesn't do much with it, at least not in a literal sense. They're driving, and there's that brain. That's the whole plot. To fill up the book, Paterniti has to give us his grand thoughts about Einstein and science. These are interesting, but they aren't THAT interesting.The book is worth reading just to find out what's happened to Einstein's brain. But that's a relatively short section. Paterniti's rambling on about science and America will not hold your attention for all 220+ pages."
2,Just O.K.,"I had great expectations starting this book. I was let down with the lack of real direction or character development. The story revolves around a young man who is helping an older gentlemen drive across the country to return Einstein's brain to a living relative. Their journey explores all kinds of ideas about Einstein. But, leaves you wondering how would Einstein feel about his brain being driven across America in a Tupperware container. I felt that the author could have done more to move the book down a path that could have kept my interest. Instead I was happy to be done with the book."
4,A Melancholy Memoir,"Here's an ultimate meta-book: a memoir about driving across country with the man whose fame rests on having removed and kept the brain of Albert Einstein. The glow of the glow of the glow!Thomas Harvey, the physician who performed the autopsy on Einstein, is himself, as sketched here, a somewhat melancholy character, and Paterniti himself is trying to find some meaning for his existence, which he achieves by marrying his long-time love Sara and by writing the memoir itself.Along the way we get a fragmented thumbnail sketch of Einstein's life and loves, descriptions of Americana from Dodge City to Las Vegas to San Jose, and a meeting with Einstein's granddaughter.The book is a meditation on fame and the meaning of life in post-Einstein, post-nuclear-bomb America. It sports some lovely poetic prose, poignant ironies, and memorable images.I hope Michael Paterniti continues his meditations and next gives us a memoir about life in Portland, Maine."
4,"It's a trip, all right","The author drove across the country with Albert Einstein's brain in a Tupperware bowl. Hmm, there's a hook we haven't seen before. ""And now for something completely different."" It's a good mix of Einstein's life and thought, oddball humor, oddball trivia, and travelogue that works well in the hands of a talented author. I'll read it again. I've always admired Einstein, and Paterniti writes well. I have much respect for Paterniti. Look at the premise. In the hands of a hack, the end result would really suck. Paterniti's a real author, and perhaps if I type his name enough times I'll remember how to spell it. It's even harder than my name."
4,a great READ,"This is a great read, one of those books that is enjoyed for itself, for the time it gives you, the pleasure. The smooth prose, the kooky real characters, the amusing real story. Maybe it doesn't relate any important or earthshattering information, you don't leave enlightened or more informed, but it isn't supposed to. It is supposed to take you somewhere you've never been before and give you some time enjoying that pure pleasure of a great quirky read and some oddball characters."
4,"Groovy tale of two men, a brain, and the women who love them","I'm a huge fan of Paterniti, whose style I know and appreciate from his writing in *Esquire*. The book doesn't disappoint--quirky yet sensitive, nonfiction but filled with storytelling. The details on Einstein himself were plentiful, and it was the good stuff, not just his ""amazing genius"" but who he was and why people are still so fascinated. Yet this book is not really about ""Big Al."" It's about two guys, an elderly owner of Einstein's brain (which he keeps in Tupperware in the trunk of the car!) and a writer flailing around in confusion (""angst"" would be exaggerating) about his life, driving across country together. If you enjoy stories that juxtapose love and science, independence and longing, humor and loneliness, you'll love this one."
2,The road trip to nowhere!,"Perhaps, my level of anticipation and expectations were too high thinking that the book, Driving Mr. Albert, would be an amusing road trip with insights to Einstein's life and mind. The book seemed more about the author's own crumby life, and his angst ridden love for Sara (page 187). In the beginning of his road trip with Dr. Harvey, as they traverse states heading west past Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, his attempt to create metaphors describing the numbing white lines lapses into jaded cliches. His writing is endless drivel and unsatisfying."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected Driving Mr. Albert to be more of a reflection or retropsective about Albert Einstein. I expected to learn a lot about Albert Einstein, his philosophies, his family, his contributions to society, little-known facts, etc.. Instead, it was in my opinion a fairly bland recollection of Mr. Paterniti's trip with the doctor and the brain. I'm sure it was an interesting trip for Mr. Paterniti, but it wasn't too interesting or insightful for me. My expectations were much different..."
1,A dull listing of minutiae,"If you are looking for an interesting book about traveling across the country along with some insight on the mathematical genius Albert Einstein, keep looking.This book is little more than a listing of minutiae as the author drives a tired old man across the country.Reading this agonizing list of every little thing the author saw, smell, said, and tasted you have to ask yourself if he was paid by the word. At best this book is an extended version of the old ""How I spent my summer"" essays we had to write in grammar school.I kept reading hoping that there was some reason the author undertook this project. I looked in vain for a character I could like or some punch line at the end. But alas the book ends as dull as it began.Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Humor or travelogue or biography or screenplay?,"What Paterniti is able to accomplish in this story is a short travel adventure across the vast American psyche. Of course, he also manages to get sidetracked by the life and times of Mr. Albert and his brain's handler, Dr. Harvey. As the story evolves I began to wonder that this is a story about the author's trip and NOT about Einstein's brain. But then I am struck with the realization that Paterniti is not only a traveler but also a fan of the brain and Dr. Harvey. It is at this point that I felt that Paterniti lost a bit of credibility in my book."
2,Left undone,"Even with the relatively short amount of words used in this book, I couldn't keep interested. The short quips about relativity are the same old textbook stuff that you read and re-read in countless other more entertaining books on Einstein. After reading 100 pages into this book, the intrigue of Einstein's brain became less and less. Afterall, it was the man that was extraordinary, not his anatomy."
3,Stranger than fiction,"Part road-trip novel, part biography of Dr. Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who performed the autopsy of Albert Einstein, this book has a you-have-to-read-it-to-believe-it feel. Michael Paterniti approached Dr. Harvey because of rumors that Harvey kept parts of Einstein's brain. Sure enough, Harvey did have the brain pieces floating in formaldehyde, and before you know it, the two of them are driving to California (with the brain) to see Einstein's granddaughter. There are some hilarious moments (such as a side trip to a high school in San Jose) and poignant moments at the end of the journey, but I was a little disappointed because there wasn't enough closure. For me, it remained a bizarre little journey."
3,"A curious subject, but not a book's worth",The history of Einstein's brain is an interesting story but it's not interesting enough to keep my attention throughout the book. The magazine article that preceded the writing of the book was probably much closer to the ideal length. In reading the story I felt that the Einstein biographical information served as a space filler and only managed to detain plot flow. The less you already know about Albert Einstein the happier you'll likely be with the book.
3,I'm kind of stupid.,"I like the part where that guy, you know, he does that thing with the monkey wrench that makes his mom sick, and she you know she says something to him about it after dinner, only he doesn't speak Italian so he pretty much has to take her word for it so he blows up their rice paddy with seven sticks of dynamite and the collected works of Vonnegut... yeah, that part was BADASS..."
2,"Same ol', same ol'","Yawn! Oh excuse me I'm supposed to be writing a review. Yeah-anyway this is the routine girl likes a boy the parents hate, Catholics vs. Protestants story. Nothing is done in a fresh way. Why is Richard Harris in this? He's completely wasted on this film. Gabriel Byrne likes to just stand there while he gets his butt kicked. And Samantha Morton's wig is just gorgeous. Notice how the ends of it look kinda green. I'm a sucker for films with an Irish theme though. So, if you're like me you might want to watch it for the heck of it. You can catch it for free on the WE channel."
1,Does not fit Land Rover Range Rover,So disappointed when I received the product I was excited. But when It came to install the product pads were to small. Now I find myself at Auto Zone buying brake pads while my mechanic waits for me at my garage. Thanks
2,Misadventures in Yorkshire..,"""The Silence of Herondale"" is Joan Aiken's first adult novel. From the jacket, you think it will be a whodoneit, but that is misleading. This is more ""watch the young woman avoid danger"" type of books. Basically, the heroine is hired as a governess for a precocious 13 year old girl, who happens to be a famous playwright. Said playwright is tired of writing, and runs away to her uncle in Yorkshire. In the meantime, the playwright meets up with a mysterious cousin named Jeremy, who warns her to ""beware of relations"". Soon, the trio has to avoid ""accidents"", as someone close wants them dead. But who? Is it the aunt who hired the heroine? The cousin? Or is it the ""Slipper Killer"" who is loose about town. Most of the plot twists are predictable with someone being the lost son of someone else, and people not being as they seem. An O.K book."
5,Another great classic!,They may be corny but I don't care. I love these old classic flicks! It's not worth the time to try to tear down or compare... just enjoy them for what they are! Good ol' fashioned entertainment. Period!
3,OKAY.,of course i remember this being a better movie as a kid. My son loved it! Movie graphics have come a long way!
3,Golden Voage of Sinbad,We teach Arabian Nights in English 12. I like to show movies associated with the stories that we read. I hope this will keep my students interested.
5,GREAT HARRYHAUSEN MASTERPIECE!,"This was the first Harryhausen movie that I saw first run at the movies! I was very familiar with RH's older film work shown on TV in the early 60's and was lucky enough to see the 7th Voyage of Sinbad at the movies in a re-release in the late 60's. When the Golden Voyage theatrical trailer played on TV I knew I would be there! This is one of his best films with some awesome creatures! Kali and the Centaur's fight with the Griffin are stand outs,but they are all super cool! A classic fantasy adventure that should be introduced to younger kids who missed out when Ray was King."
3,Good Sunday Matinee,"First let me say I own all of Harryhausen's movies. I love his work so if I seem a little critical on a couple it is only because I know how great he can be. This movie may not be Harryhausen's best stop motion animation, but it is still a fine film. The hair on the centaur seems to move a little odd and the motion in the Centaur and Griffon fight scene is not as natural looking as the skeleton fight scenes in ""Jason and the Argonauts"". Otherwise this movie is very well done and packed with creatures. I especially liked the job he did on the magicians familiars. It entertains and has good locations and a decent cast. Those fans of Tom Baker in Dr. Who will enjoy him as an evil magician. It is good Saturday afternoon fare for the entire family. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys movies like ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Willow"", and ""Krull"". I bought this on DVD in the Sinbad Collection set and I am very happy with how well the transfer to DVD was done."
5,6 arms and six swords...,"The scenes with Kali, the 6 armed goddess, are enough to make this movie worth buying. A good story line, several other monsters, and Caroline Munro (the movie's other goddess - WOW!) also make this a keeper.I enjoy Golden Voyage as much as 7th Voyage."
5,A must have and must share for personal evolution,"Finally a book that puts all the pieces together to show me why I have success sometimes and not others. I'm so glad I found this book.....I not only love it, I've bought it to share with friends for their spiritual and personal unfoldment.And a personal Thank you to the author, Verlaine Crawford for sharing her personal story and for allowing me to finally understand how the different parts of me can come together for personal and professional success that will continue now that I have the TOOLS!!!Blessings and please write more books for those of us who want to have more success and personal peace."
5,Los Temerarios son muy romanticos,Nosotras somos muy fanaticas de Los Temerarios y pues tenemos todos sus CD's y que puede decir los adoramos y ya.
5,Los Temerarios have a lot of romantic music.,First of all I love very romantic music especially baladas. This group sings good and personally think people should hear it. I love Temerarios and I am also have almost all their CDS . I just want to say that this group is great and I am a very big fan of Los Temerarios.
3,Sex and Fury,"70's movie with fighting and imagery. I got a chuckle from watching this classic. A guy at work told me about it so I bought it and enjoyed it mainly for how cheesy it was to me. If you're looking for a graphic movie then it isn't for you. If you want a movie that offers a throw-back to early martial arts movies that has some topless fights then you'll enjoy it. The story is interesting enough, and overall not a bad movie."
4,Revenge,"This is the story of a woman seeking revenge for the people who ordered the murder of her father; a policeman. She witnessed the murder as a child. There is much sword-play and blood, in true Japanese style, with her nakedness adding an interesting dimension to the proceedings. There is one scene that will excite some and offend others, concerning nuns, a cross and a whip. If you like such empty-headed entertainment (and sometimes I do), then this is a film to enjoy!Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
3,spy movie,"This is a Janpanese story on international spies. Love to a country leads to revenge and murder. Bondage and poisoningare no surprise at all. When compared to American movie ""Kill Bill"", this foreign video fails in the quality of photographyand playful swordsmanship. The ending is limited to Japanese culture: death for a country.Overall, entertainment level is not that strong."
2,never realy takes off,"It's not clear to me what some of the other reviewers saw in this movie, or whether we even saw the same movie. A contrived story of revenge with a convoluted storyline, sex scenes with actors that must have been cheap at the time, and (admittedly a lot) of poorly shot violence make a poor mix. It looks really dated and just doesn't come together. Its music score seems to come straight from a 'Shaft' film, but 'Sex and Fury' is not half as funny. With so many excellent Japanese movies to chose from there is need to go there. Two stars is generous."
1,Steak sauce undercover,"This ""Hot Sauce"" takes more like a cheap steak sauce. It was disgusting. So much so I could not finish the sauce, and had to throw it away. If you like heat I would try spontaneous combustion. That is a much better sauce."
5,Visit your childhood again through this wonderful lady,"A delightful trip back to the childhood stories that I loved. Jessica Tandy shows the flustration of getting old with nothing to do, and how important it is to just be yourself. ."
1,Amazon is shipping DVD-Rs not the Image DVD release,"Just a word of warning, the DVD of The Story Lady that Amazon is currently shipping is not the edition advertised. It IS NOT the original Image edition, but instead one from Screen Media Ventures, oh and it's a DVD-R. The cover is not even remotely close to the one shown on the page, the UPC code is a sticker stuck on the case, and again the back of the case says it's a DVD-R. Just wanted to make everyone aware before you purchase an inferior DVD-R and have to waste time trying to get a refund. Once Amazon creates a separate listing or stops selling this version as the long out of print Image DVD release, I will delete or modify this review."
4,Good Condition Fast Response,Just watched it again. I love this show. Thanks for helping my '80s movie habit.
5,Scandalously Funny,"Steve Martin and Michael Caine try to outdo each other in the swindling department. Along the way they give us a very funny movie. This was a very successful pairing of the two actors. Caine plays a high end swindler, while Steve Marin is an on the go, fast-working crook. They both want to have monopoly on a push European resort and neither of them is able to get it.The ending is great. People like people with common interests, even ""crooks."" I enjoyed this movie very much."
4,Schemes to Screams of Laughter,"When two conniving men (Michael Caine & Steve Martin) compete for the ultimate scheme, bouts of laughter are bound to follow. Such is the case with ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"" a comedy which starts slow but soon picks up. Although the humor is often more wit than slapstick, younger viewers will find it not as enjoyable as others, but Martin's ""crazy"" character will hold their interest. However, if none of the above sounds inticing, the film is worth watching just to hear Ian McDiarmid say, ""Welcome to Hell."""
4,Delightful,I have watched this movie three or four times and it has never failed to amuse me on each of those occasions.Humour is a personal thing so there are many who might not share my feelings about Dirty Rotten Scoundrels - suffice to say the combination of an urbane Michael Caine with a exuberant Steve Martin tickled me!It is a lightweight show that makes no Oscar winning pretences other than to entertain. And that it does magnificently.
5,The best comedy in the eighties!,"This film took by assault the abandoned concept of the comedy in his most genuine expression and gave it that Midas touch so well developed in the Fifties in U.K.(Kind hearts and cornetsThe ladykillers , The lavender hill mob ., Whisky Gallore , Hobson choice , The man in the white suit).The lesson is crude : once more the hunter hunted fable is represented for Steve Martin as a pedestrian fake who knows to a mots respected gentleman with good maners and extraordibnary elegance (Michael Caine) , but there's something which spies behind the doors of our fate.Watch this clever and unforgettable movie . There are a lot of laughable situations but the best jokes are simply suggested .Caine in one of his best top performances and Martin making a towering role .Don't miss this one."
4,"Great movie, almost great DVD","First off, this is a great movie. The writing, combined with Steve Martin and Michael Caine at their absolute best, make for a truly winning combination. I first saw this on cable back when it was new, and it continues to make me laugh.Unfortunately, the DVD leaves a little to be desired. It does contain a nice commentary track by director Frank Oz, but nothing from Martin or Caine. The ""making of"" doc is pretty good, but should've been better. It's just a little too short for my taste. Still, the digital transfer is great, which brings out the beauty of the locations."
3,Worth a look...,"I had nothing but high hopes for this movie when I sat down to watch it. Steve Martin? Michael Caine? Does it get any better? Yes, yes it does.The movie did not suck me in, really ever. The best part of the movie is Glynne Headley, whose motive you are not quite sure of until the very end. She is quiet and convincing and gives a performance that sneaks up on you.I will say that Steve Martin's performance as Ruprick, Laurence's mentally retarded brother, made my laugh out loud. The genital cuff and the cork on a fork was priceless. It's worth a watch if you've never seen it, if for no other reason to grasp the references to it in current pop culture."
1,Movie is great. Wrong product.,"One of my favorite movies that I've always wanted a copy of. I just didn't have enough knowledge or realize that it was a European version or something like that and won't play on many, if any of our systems. So it's useless...would love to get the right version."
3,Disappointing Steve Martin,"This is not nearly as amusing or clever as reviewers would have one believe. The script is inconsistent and ultimately depends upon an Agatha Christie type identity switcheroo at the end, a very cheap way to end a story. Miller overdoes things, especially the Jerry Lewis impersonations. Caine is as cool and effective as usual. On the whole, the film is only average entertainment for the superficial."
4,omy,"""Blade of Darkness"" is like a good steak; after the first bite, you just gotta have more. A good swipe of your sword; Claymore?,and your adversary totters, neck spurting type O, while his recently attached noggin goes rolling down the gutter, must be experienced. Very immersive. Nice special effects also, but takes a good 3D card, so be warned you may have to run this with most of the goodies turned off. Still, you won't be disappointed; it's one of those games that stands out and will have you up half the night. En Guard!"
4,Suprisingly good impulse buy,"I was'nt expecting much, after playing ""Rune"", the last 3rd person view D&D type action game that I bought, but this game is actually fun to play. Like ""Oni"", this game allows your character to learn and use different moves to take out your enemies. Also, Blade of Darkness lets you choose different characters to play: A Barbarian, an Amazon, a Knight and a Dwarf. Each character has different strengths and there are a wide variety of weapons at your disposal.The game engine is pretty impressive as well, the lighting effects are really interesting. The game itself is not too impossible nor is it too easy. The Save Game feature also keeps the game from being too frustrating.I would highly recommend this game to D&D fans as well as fans of action games."
3,live by the sword......,"Blade of Darkness looked set to achieve new heights in the fantasy/action genre. I must say I'm a little dissapointed. Although it excels in various departments,( the lighting and use of shaddows is quite frankly exceptional, and adds to the very creepy and atmospheric feel of the game) it is let down in some critical areas. Despite the importance of great graphics, it is gameplay and originality which makes a great game and Blade of Darkness has nothing we haven't seen in a dozen other action/adventure games. Climbing up walls and jumping over ledges may have been revolutionary before a certain Ms Croft arrived on the scene, but now it just seems dated. In fairness maybe I'm being a little harsh on the game, as I can't honestly say I didn't enjoy hacking the enemy into numerous pieces and duelling against the very good AI. I was just expecting the first true classic action game of the century and what I got was another fairly decent one to add to my collection."
5,Excellent,"It has excellent 3d graphics, enemies and battles.The end is less of what I expected but is great."
3,Chancer,NOt as good as season one but very watcheable. Clive Owen does do this character very well as do the others with their roles.
2,Disappointing,"I loved the first installment of this series: a Dumas-like swashbuckler that felt both wonderfully old-fashioned and subtly modern. It was also suspenseful, as was the second book, which was not as thrilling as the first and often bogged down with excessively long descriptive passages. Still, I was looking forward to ""The Sun Over Breda.'' Alas, a disappointment. No character development to speak of, and not much plot either. Just a detailed description of a military operation: trench warfare of long ago, a seige, a battle. Interesting if you're a military history buff, I suppose, but not much of a story (and since the reader knows from the get-go that Alatriste and Inigo will survive, not much doubt about the outcome either). I'd give the next installment a chance, but if it plods like ""Breda,'' I'll be giving up on Alatriste."
2,Weakest in the series,"I've been enjoying the Captain Alatriste novels but I have to say this is the weakest in the series. It tells how the captain and his young ward Inigo take part in the brutal Spanish war in the Netherlands. There is little sword play and the villains who enliven the other books in the series make no appearance here. Instead, we have awful descriptions of battles and atrocities. It doesn't help that I felt strongly that Alatriste and Inigo are on the wrong side. The Spanish had no business in the Netherlands and represented a backward, repressive, intolerant, racist ideology. Inigo constantly refers to the enemy as heretics bound for hell. Of course, this is historically accurate -- but in a book like this one must root for the heroes and identify with them and it's impossible to do so here. I kept hoping the Spanish would lose."
4,Always entertaining!,"Once again Captain Alatriste saves the day. Another entertaining and couragueous story from this fine author. Looking forward to the upcoming book in this series. Do yourself a favor, start at the first one and read them through, you will be glad you did."
4,Can't wait for the next one,I wish Amazon would just allow us to rate these items and not require the paragraph. others have expressed the merits of this work well enough and I don't have the time to write more.
2,Huge disappointment,"Being a fan of this genre and of Perez-Reverte in particular, I could not wait for the translation of this book and bought the Spanish version with an eye to reading it as a summer project. The English version arrived in the US market before summer and trumped this plan and many other projects, but not, I am sad to say, for good reason. This book is a huge disappointment. The previous books of the series were swashbuckling mysteries interplaying characters of various levels of Spanish society at the time. Essential to the stories was character development which included the motivations, prejudices and lifestyles of the various players. Perez-Reverte is a master at this and the first two read like a delightful combination of Jorge Amado and Dumas. In contrast, Breda reads like a frontline chronicle and like war, reduces character motivation to survival and nationalism. We really expect better from one of the worlds most famous living authors."
5,Loved It!,"Even if you're not a fan of mystery books you'll love this one!The characters are wonderful, interesting and seem very ""real""; before too long, in fact, you'll feel you've known them forever. It's funny, unusual, at times a little unsettling, with a tone all its own. A very easy read, I only wished it went on longer. If you are a fan of mysteries, you NEED to read this one."
4,A delightful read,"Just finished this wonderful book. It's amazingly funny, warm, intersting and also unbelievable but thats what gives it its charm. Wonderfully written, Fantastic Characters and an interesting mystery. Odd is a bit like odd thomas (steven Koontz) wonder who came first? Ir you are looking for a very funny and light mystery and one with warm paranormal overtones , this book is for you. So glad I found it.Lisa"
2,"Poor Quality, came delivered with rip in net","I bought this product because there were positive reviews on this site, however this product is the lowest grade leaf rake I have ever seen. The product was damaged with a ripped net, obviously during packaging because the shipping box was perfectly fine. Evidently the shipping folks didn't inspect the product very closely prior to shipping it out."
5,Great book!,"I absolutely love this book! Whenever I'm struggling with being a genuine person, I read this. I knew Stacie was a strong Christian but then I read this book. It's great because it just gives insight into Stacie's life. What's she's like, what her family's like, etc. It also attacks the issue of all of the struggle of trying to be genuine in an artificial world. Great job Stacie!"
4,Slightly Over-rated,Some bits are better than others. A lot of the pieces would have been stronger had they not been ripped from the context of the performers' full appearance. One annoyance is that some of the people in the audience are so close to the mic that their laughing overpowers the voice of the performer. Andy Dick does a very funny song and Julia Sweeny is very winning in her performace.
2,I HOPE IT'S THE UN & ONLY,"this may have been an interesting concept album - and more fun in person - butfor my taste it was poorly recorded, too loud, and not very funny."
4,How to begain to travel,"This is a gem of a book. The author is a very seasoned world traveler, and it shows in both presentation and information. Why only 4 stars. Sadly, I have a ton of ""how to"" books, and most of the information presented as not new to me. However, if your starting to travel, this is a fine book to pick up!"
3,Not reading the fine print caused disappointment,Every cat I have owned has loved these balls and my local stores has stopped carrying them. So I was excited to see I could get an entire bucket for a great price. I was surprised when I received a little envelope containing a package of 4 balls. Looking pack at the product description revealed my (understandable) error. How hard is it to take a picture of the product listed? 5 stars for the product but it drops to 3 when the misleading picture is factored in.
1,misrepresentation,To bad the picture does not show that you only get 4 overpriced balls. When you find them at the store they are only 99 cents
3,has anyone tried this camera?,"My star rating doesn't count because I have not tried the product.Seattle customer, is it correct to infer that your opinion is not based on actually trying the camera? As I understand it, the Foveon image sensor in the SD9 is different from the sensors in the 6 megapixel cameras you refer to in that each pixel in the SD9 is capable of sensing either red, blue, or green light, whereas in the conventional sensors any given pixel can only sense one color. That means it takes three pixels in a conventional sensor to provide the true color data provided by one pixel in the Foveon sensor. There may be more pixels in an image from a 6 mp sensor, but many of those pixels are artificially created by computer interpolation rather than being based on direct sensing of incoming light. Also this means the conventional camera must take more time to process the image in camera."
2,I wish there were something better,I used this book for the last two semesters to teach Introduction to Process Technology.It does seem to be the best book available although it is filled with errors.I wish there were something better.
4,Millie's voice blends well with the modern rock tempos!,"I happened to stumble upon this discovery as I was listening to the CD's displayed at one of the listening stations from a local CD franchise. I found that I greatly enjoyed one of her songs, but as I began to listen to the CD, I enjoyed all her songs on the CD. I would definately purchase her next CD. Most of her contemporary rock rythems blend well with her voice, and she has a very strong sound. I would definately recommend her album, even if you don't understand the language, which I do not, I still enjoy the music!"
4,Millie is hot! Su voz es muy bella,"Ahora escucho este cd. Es tan suave para la manana y la noche. Quisiera oir su voz en cualquiera lengua...espanol, ingles, portugues..."
5,Prompt to service,My first encounter with the amazon.com proved that they were very reliable and prompt to service. Thanks for your continuous services.Paul Ikechukwu Ogujioffor.
2,This recording is satisfactory,"First of all, this is NOT a Christmas CD in any way shape or form, except for the fact that it is a live show recorded at the Amrep Christmas Party at the Turf Club, in St. Paul Minnesota, on December 20, 1996. If you're a hard-core fan of the band and wouldn't mind another album by the band, that happens to be live, then go ahead and get it. Otherwise, it's not anything special that would stand out 10 years from now."
2,just ok,"These candlesticks are just barely worth the effort. Wrappables was great in their shipping, etc. But the candlesticks came out of the package dingy and greyish with some kind of film. When washed, they had filled about a quarter of the way with soapy water. There were no care instructions included. They remind me of something you might pick up at a flea market. They will work for the use I have in mind but if you are looking for something that looks like crystal - stay clear!"
3,Review of lens,"The lens doesn't click into place and thus doesn't stay on very well. If you plan on being very active (i.e. running) with the lens attached, this isn't for you. But if u're just sitting or standing around in one place, you'll be fine. It does its job well as an optical zoom and is nicely crafted."
5,an interesting and thought-provoking piece of scholarship,"I was inspired by the icredible insight and interesting acedemic thought in this book -- it's hard to beleive that it was written over fourty years ago. The struggle with ""the terror of history"" and the horror of linear time is something that many of us still struggle with today.As a student of literature, I found this book particularly helpful in studying the moderns, such as T.S. Eliot and James Joyce, who, as Eliade mentions, both express a longing to return to the cyclical. As a mythology-lover I found that this book gave me a new perspective on the study of myth -- which I feel is still important if we are to understand the primitive depths of our own minds."
1,Atlas of the north american indians,This was the first time I used amazon.com. I thought that this item was a map / atlas not a book. I was looking for a map of american indians.
5,Excellent reference work on North American Indian Nations,"I bought this book because I needed to have a clearer geographical picture on the North American Indian Nations covered by ""500 Nations"" (the TV-series and the CD-ROM). What I got is a lot more than I expected! The title ""Atlas..."" is truly an understatement! This book covers the geography, the social and historical issues involved in the genesis and evolution of these Great Nations!If you're looking for a very extensive reference work on the North American Indian Nations, buy this book!"
3,"Great Book, damaged product","The content of the book is an awesome piece of pre american history. The condition of the book itself was below average. It's cover was dirty and scratched, and the binding was cut and edgees of the pages scrapped and some partially torn, it appears it was damaged somehow.. but since the overall price was so cheap and I like the content of the book I will not go through the trouble of returning it and just keep it..not sure if I'd use the same vender..I bought another Indian History book from another vender for a very fair price and that book appears to be close to new...."
4,"Good info, well organized","While I enjoy this book and its wealth of info and maps, it is a shame that the only map in color is on the cover. 4.5 stars."
2,Would have preferred more ancient and archaic material . . .,". . . as it was, by page 34 I had exhausted most of the material in my area of interest. And even though it is a thick book, a lot of those pages are taken up with possibly non-essential or uninteresting information. So be sure to ""Look Inside;"" even though it may be a different edition, it can show the geral outlines of the volume."
5,Atlas of the North American Indian,"I found this book very helpful and informative. I like the way it is laid out with prehistory, history, and modern views as well as plenty of maps and overviews of such things as traditional practices where comparison was easy in areas such as shelters, transportation, environments and traditional medicines. It is a book I will use for the rest of my life, as an instructor and as a person."
3,Nice book but way over-priced,"Very nice book and interesting topic. The book is basically in standard textbook format. I paid $80 for the book, and when I received it, I was disappointed, because I was expecting something bigger, more thorough, with larger glossy illustrations and maps. Although the book is a hardback, it's relatively small, and even though the book is categorized as an atlas, the maps are small and not as detailed as I would expect in a high-priced atlas. I might pay $80 for a large hardback art book with glossy illustrations, or for a large world atlas, but the price for this book definitely did not match what I received, and frankly, though I like the book, I felt ripped off."
5,North American Indian Research,"I am using this as part of my research to aid me with the series of paintings I am doing of North American Indians from the period 1850 through 1910. I found it interesting that of the paintings I have completed thus far, I often get asked by Native Americans if I have yet done any paintings of members of their tribes. This book helps with the geographical aspects of where my subjects may have been located at the time they lived."
3,Worth it,"If you are a hard core Kyuss or QOTSA fan, this CD is worth buying.Personally, I like the QOTSA tracks on this better. The Kyuss tracks are definitely Kyuss and mildly memorable, but they definitely aren't on the same level as 'Phototropic' and 'Freedom Run'. The QOTSA tracks, on the other hand, are awesome. A slower, sludgier 'If Only' shares the spotlight with the equally compelling 'Born To Hula'. 'Spiders and Vinegaroons' is a fairly interesting instrumental, mellow and hypnotic, but you probably won't find yourself humming its tune in the shower or anything."
4,Kyuss leave their mark as the greatest stoner band ever,"Kyuss are at their crushing best with their three tracks,""Fatso Forgotso Phase 2"" standing out the most as a fast moving and hard hitting catchy song.Queens of the stone age can't match up to the strength of Kyuss' songs, but ""If only everything"" is a well structured catchy song. Overall, Queens of the stone age show promise here, and it's just a shame this marked kyuss' demise."
3,good,I gave this one as a gift only read a tiny bit. But the receiver says it is good. Someday I will also read the whole thing.
3,School requirement: course textbook,"When the book is required for the course, there's not much to say. Except somebody in the school system likes the book!"
5,great experience,I saved over $100 by purchasing this book for school from this seller!The book arrived extremely fast and was in excellent condition. Overall this was a great experience!
3,Text book review,"While this book arrived in great shape and was new, it also was loose leaf, which I didn't notice in the ad for it. Probably my own fault, and it worked out anyway, but had I realized it, I would've purchased a traditional style book."
2,Limited textbook on marrige and the family,"This is the standard textbook for studying marriage and the family, unfortunately. It is quite a good introduction with interdiscplinary perspectives from thee authors, but their underlying definition of ""family"" is inherently flawed. The traditinal ""family"" definition is not covered, nor are alternatives to contraception and abortion like chastisty and nurturing women who want to keep their baby.Someone needs to write a similiar textbook without this underlying bias. I hope there is a publisher out there that will agree."
2,Buy this book only if you have to,"This book is required by the college where I teach, otherwise I would not use it in class. It's poorly researched. Information is presented in sweeping generalizations. The authors never discuss the nature and scope of sociological research. As a result, studies that merely ""suggest"" certain trends are given equal weight and emphasis as more rigorous, conclusive research. In many chapters, the authors contradict themselves from one page to the next. As a college instructor, I have had find extensive supplementary material to correct many of the mistakes in this text.Another issue of importance for college students is the cost of this barely useful text. This looseleaf edition, while inconvenient (yes, you need a binder), is significantly cheaper than the hardcover edition. If you are required by your school to waste your money on this book, it makes sense to purchase the cheaper edition."
4,Great if you're into the topic,"I was required to read this for a college course... it wasn't awful... the topic was a little boring for me, but the author makes it easy to read and understand."
2,Sega Bass Fishing,"SEGA BASS FISHINGEasy to install and great graphics. Playing the game may be too complex for young kids. My one complaint was that once the game was loaded, I was unable to get rid of it; it remained in my Task Bar. In order to remove it I had to reboot. No complaints of the seller nor the price.RGG - Texas"
1,terrible,"This may be the worst pc game ive ever tried dont waste ur time or money on it mouse doesnt work ,all done with keys, cant set ur controls to your liking all preset its just a rotten game"
5,Appreciation for Fathers,"Ms. Ziefert does it again with her children's book about fathers. There are two more uses for dad than there are for mom but it is still good. Children young and old will be delighted to get this book as a gift for the special man in their life--dad, or a father-figure. I sure was delighted as well as my father when I got this book for him on his birthday. It is a great read and shows appreciation for fathers."
4,"Cool movie, but NO spanish audio",John Candy is great in this movie. But I wanted this DVD because of the spanish audio track - like it stays written on backside of the cover. But on the DVD there is NO SPANISH AUDIO. How comes that. And this is the second time that this happens to me with a DVD. I am really angry with Columbia Tristar!
4,One of MY Favorite John Candy films,"This movie and ""Uncle Buck"" are two of my favorite ""Candy"" films"". John Candy has put out other greats as well but my top 2 are the above. In this movie, Candy is a bumbling detective but seems to get the job done ""the Candy way"". He knows everything, but what is going on! It's Great! The rest of the cast are irreplaceable. But It, Watch It."
5,Harry Crumb Is The Best Dumb Blonde Joke Ever :),"When you're looking for a laugh John Candy is a sure thing. Harry Crumb is one of his hilarious, dumb-but-endearing characters. Harry is accidentally smart sometimes but always sure that he is astute. Is he faking it?"
2,Harry Crumb,"A typical overused plot idea, and while John Candy is a good actor, somehow his jokes fall flat. Maybe I've heard them all before. Or maybe by now, all the plot situations are familiar."
2,Harry,The movie was in perfect condition but i wouldnt advise ordering it from Zoverstocks i bought this as a christmas gift for my wife and it didnt show up till about half thorugh january!! i ordered about 4 other things along with this DVD the same day and everything arrived on time so im just confused what took my order so long
5,One of the greatest John Candy movies ever!,"John Candy at his best. Different disguises, the innocent stupidity that only John Candy could do. I have seen this movie over twenty times, and it is still just as funny as the first time. Definitly one of the greatest."
2,Harry Leaves No Crumbs By Mark Stassen,"Starring John Candy,Jeffrey Jones 1989. In this slapstick performance,we find John Candy as (Harry Crumb)private eye who has been assigned to investigate a kidnapping case.There is a cameo performance by old friend (Jim Belushi of SNL) I was very disappointed with the VHS copy.Unfortunately the art direction of this movie is very dated.If you are a fan of FLETCH this is a must.One of Candy's funniest. Mark Phillip Stassen."
3,kinda funny?!,i laughed a few times at john candy's offbeat humor it's not halarious but it will make you giggle and snicker at his goofy personality
2,Funny but Candy's- done better! I did pass Suki's Hungarian Salon in Vancovuer on way 2 airport 11/05 going home from Grey Cup,"Child molester Jeffrey Jones (FerrisBueller's principal) does the worstperformance of his career. Full of lamegags and dumb dialog, Shawny Smith, BarryCorbin, Tim Thomerson and Candy come offbest in here. Good disguises though...Candy as jockey - Yikes! The poor horses!Even worse on them in Wagons East (*.5)!"
5,Great new artist!,"Funky and hip! I've only had ""Boundless"" for a short time (recommended to me by a friend), and it is already a favorite CD in my collection. The production is flawless, and some of my favorite musicians are included. I'm looking forward to more recordings from Scott. Great stuff!"
4,Good book for reference,"Software Engineering Principles and Practice by Hans van Vliet is a good textbook which delves into the WHAT of software development, and takes a user through the normal Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from requirements gathering to deployment in a production environment. And like good software, each chapter is loosely coupled allowing the reader to get more information on the topic of interest.This book however does not go into details on the HOW, and was left me a little unsatisfied on best practices, and how to improve my skills as a software engineer.This book is great for students as well as professionals involved in Software Engineering. It gives students an overview of what to expect in a software shop, but is more of a reference book for professionals to give a little further insight into the different aspects of the SDLC."
3,"It works, but...","...why on earth did Nature's Way add iron to the mix? Those who takes supplemental thyroid hormone or other drugs that bind with iron--tetracycline, for example--will have to go through incredible contortions to adjust their dosing schedule. Given that there are many other standardized Rhodiola rosea products available, it makes more sense to avoid this one. I've switched to the NSI product, and I couldn't be happier.The company is excellent, and it makes generally terrific products, but whoever decided that Rhodiola rosea needs to be adulterated with iron made a big mistake."
3,"Works, but.......","Mood was elevated almost immediately after first use, and that part was great, although I never perceived any of the energy boosting effects vaunted. I used it about 5 or 6 weeks. I have a rather sensitive digestive system, and at some point, I began to experience vague pains in the stomach or intestines. Since the problem didn't start promptly with beginning the RR, I didn't connect the two. When I began having mild pain and discomfort almost continuously, I googled the subject, and discovered that digestive upset was a possible side effect. After discontinuing use, the discomfort very quickly disappeared."
5,"Very calming, easy on stomach, more energy.","The product recommends to take 2 of these daily, however I only take 1. I have found that I have more energy after taking the product for 2 weeks. I also find it helps to keep me calm and in better spirits.It might be best to start by taking 1 pill a day and see how you react to it, when I tried taking 2 pills I was having a hard time sleeping. I would recommend the product."
4,Added Energy,"I've been looking for a little energy boost for some time. This is the best product I have found so far. It adds a little energy, lifts my mood out of the ""winter doldrums"", and makes me feel peaceful. The only drawback is that it does upset my stomach somewhat so I always take it at meal time."
5,Meet My Needs in High Elevation Training,"This is the one!It boost my workout metabolism.Quality, Effectiveness and Price are all acceptable.I will continue to use it and I would recommend it to people who are in training for better fitness."
3,Tried it for two weeks,I do believe I have more energy in the morning and late evenings.But the pass two weeks I've felt sleepy around the 3-5 pm time.I'll stop taking it this week and start up again next week and see.
2,"Sticky, Nasty, Worse Than Before","The original Arm & Hammer was great -- worked terrifically well, was a little flaky but not too bad, effective odor absorption without stinky perfumes.This new Arm & Hammer product is nasty. Sticky and disgusting. Worse than roll-on deodorant! I was a huge fan of the old stuff, but it is no longer available. I recommend looking elsewhere. I have switched to B*n's roll-on product. It is less flaky; doesn't work quite as well, but it is less sticky & nasty."
5,good deodorant,good deodorant. make sure it has baking soda in the ingredients and you wont sweat. its awesome. big fan thanks
5,What a Blessing,"I had the priviledge of meeting and hearing this extraordinary musician, singer, and minister yesterday when she performed in Key West, Florida for the 139th Anniversary of Cornish Memorial AME Zion church. What a potent combination of positive vibe, gentleness, and musicianship. The lyrics to the songs are uplifting and the gentle melodies and lovely intricate harmonies create a wonderful ""space"" in which to connect to the universe and higher consciousness.Want a blessing? Buy this CD!"
4,The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"This movie kept your attention from beginning to end,,Entertaining for all ages!! Good animation as well. Well recomended. Good acting as well"
2,Questionable blu-ray transfer....,This review is primarily about the blu-ray disc and not the movie itself (which is wonderful and since it has been around for so long I'm sure most of you have seen it). As for the blu-ray transfer and disc itself there are several problems I've had.- First off the transfer is full screen and not wide screen. I cannot fathom why this was done as the regular DVD was in wide screen.- Overall the resolution is only slightly better than the original but only in some places. In others it's very grainy.- The colors... pumping up the colors to day-glo levels just doesn't work for me. Yes the colors were a bit muted in the original but what they've done is just silly.- There are no extras to speak of (and the extras mentioned in other reviews are in the regular DVD release ONLY).I honestly can't recommend anyone purchase this version of the film over the regular DVD widescreen release.
4,One of my All time favorites of the SInbad movies,"Worth the watch, the props and creatures are a little cheesy but can be watched by the entire family. Clean fun!"
3,Not as impressive as later offerings.,"Monday, January 24, 2005 / 3 of 5 / Not as impressive as later offerings.Hadn't seen this one in decades and had forgotten much of the plot. Interestingly there wasn't much there, the baddy is not as notable as the Golden Voyage or the Eye of the Tiger, but oh that Cyclops and Dragon! A bit sad to see the Roc baby barbequed, but the prisoner/crew got their comeuppance when mom got home. Sinbad is blackmailed into getting the magician's genie lamp. The magician had shrunk the betrothed princess so it's off to the isle of Colossi with a crew of prisoners. Hmm, mutiny possibilities anyone? Fortunately the formula would be perfected in later Sinbad films, this one lacks a bit. But I did get a kick out of watching the magician egg on the Dragon like a puppy to chase Sinbad."
4,Still as good as when I furst saw it as a kid!,"I remember taking a subway train in Brooklyn when I was a kid and seeing the advetisement poster in the station for this movie and couldn't wait to see it. I was not disapointed when I did, and still enjoy it today. The Blu-Ray disc has finally done this movie justice. Colors are vibrant and the transfer is excellant given the fact that this movie is almost fifty years old. Harryhausen's animation is at his best here and he continued to excel with his later efforts. If your a fan, get the Blu-Ray copy!Al L. - Pawleys island SC"
5,Excellent =),"Real fun movie to watch, great effects, and also great story line as well. I LOVE when the maiden is turned into a half cobra half human by the evil magician for the sultans party, that was really kewl :)A great movie to have and watch over again!"
5,Sinbad meets Monster Island,"I don't have this movie any more, but when I did, I'd watch this movie all've the time. The story's about Sinbad trying to save his love one from a mad sorcerer that is hiding on Colosso Island. The island includes Monoclopses, each one larger than the next. A two headed Roc with wings the length of a jumbo jet. And a 50 ft. long flame spitting dragon seeming to be evil but really just protecting his den. The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad is a treasure for all Si-Fi and action fans(especially action fans)."
2,7th voyage of Sinbad,The image quality was so bad that it didn't benefit from being put out on blu-ray. I would stick to the DVD on this one.
4,Ray Harryhausen's specail effects are great,One of Ray Harryhausens many movies. Kerwin Mathews does a good job in this movie also. Both men also worked together in the movie Jack the Giant Killer (also a good movie). Of course you have to appreciate the time and effort it took to make these movies.
3,Great in its day,"As a kid i loved this movie and was in awe of the special effects. Still better than a Godzilla movie even today. Rent it and see, my son liked it."
3,Classic Creature Animation,"This was my favorite movie when I was a small child. I hadn't seen it since the 50s when it was in theaters. I still found it enjoyable if somewhat lacking in quality of both acting and writing. The scenes with the monsters still remain wonderful examples of the time and were what I remembered most. The story is much simpler than I recalled, the plot thinner and the acting mostly awful, but I still liked it because of the fond memories it brought back."
5,Better than the box,"I started to leave the stove in the box, and move it around. Well the stove is alittle heavier than I thought it would be. The carrying case, unknown to me when ordering it, has WHEELS on it, makes moving to and from my trailer in grass of dirt, a snap. Highly recommend the case."
5,carringcase/cover,The cover fit perfect. Easy to get on and off. Made it much easier for me to move folded grill around.
5,Great Invention,"I bought this brush for my 2 year old and was impressed with it. The spinning action gets me more bang for my buck in the sometimes limited time the brush is in my son's mouth. I may be over-analyzing it, but I think the fact that it's a race car makes the sound of it cool instead of scary."
1,Poor Customer Service,"This item depicts three brushes and the description didn't specify that. I was surprised to receive only one. When I sent a polite note to HBA Zone to point out that they might want to revise the image or the description, they never replied. When I left poor feedback as a result of not hearing, they sent me a message stating ""We noticed the feedback that you left on our website. We are sorry that you are unhappy with your transaction.. We would have liked to be notified of the issue so that we can help you with the problem or at least issue a refund. To make up for the trouble, we are offering to issue a $5.00 refund if you remove the feedback. ""Pretty good, HBA Zone. You ignored my ""notifying you of the issue"", then, when I left you poor feedback, you tried to buy my removal of the feedback without ever addressing the original issue. Nice way to do business..."
3,In Jokes aplenty,"This movie is great fun, especially if you're into HK movies at all. From the Jackie Chan manager look-alike to the jabs at John Woo (everytime Jet Li picks up a gun it has no ammo, unlike Woo's films in which everyone seems to have unlimited ammo), this is a rip roaring film. I didn't give it a higher rating because the martial arts I was expecting from Jet were nonexistent. Oh, and watch out for that helicopter...you know the one crashing through the high rise. Good stuff."
4,Don't take it seriously,"Don't take this movie for more than what it is, a comedy. It was funny, Jet Li fans won't find what they're looking for, if they want typical Jet Li. It's some pretty good fighting scenes at the end, especially when Frankie, turns from a coward to a fighting machine. If you watch this movie not expecting much, you'll be pleased."
2,I love Jet Li but hate this movie,"Horrible, horrible.... I wipe a tear form my face, jaw on the floor, wondering to myself, ""how could my Jet make such a ... movie?"" It starts out bad, and spirals into one of the worst thought out action strings I've ever seen (short of Jet's ""the Master"" (Hong Kong version). Some of his fights are tolerable but there is a scene with a helicopter that made my stomach turn in its total disregard of reality. I know, I know, you fans of spiritual kung-fu are mad at me now but be aware that this movie isn't set up that way. Frankly, I'd rather watch a Van-Dammage movie before enduring the torture of viewing this ... again. I'd suggest watching, or just buying, Fist of Legend and be happy in the knowledge that you have one of the finest fighting films of all time- with Jet Li of course!"
2,"This is a Jet Li movie, right?","This is a Jet Li movie, right? If so, why is the best fighting scene not involve him? It involves the guy that is making fun of Jackie Chan. Who ever dubbed Jet needs to be fired. He....talks....like....this. If you want to see Jet at his best, rent ""Fist of Legend"" (MY FAV), ""Twin Warriors,"" and ""The Enforcer."" Don't waste your money on this garbage. Sorry Jet. Better luck next time."
4,"GREAT, AMUSING, GOOD ACTION","Take a plot stolen from Die Hard and mix it together with poking fun at Jackie Chan and you've got High Risk, one of Wong Jing and Jet Li's best efforts. Jet Li plays the stuntman for Asia's leading action hero, who's famous for doing his own stunts (wink, wink). The parody of Jackie Chan is hilarious, depicting ""Frankie"" as a bumbling boob with an inflated movie star ego. The whole movie moves briskly and has enough decent action and oddball humor to keep one deeply entertained. I rank it up there as one of Jet li's best and as one of the funnier Hong Kong movies I've seen. Definitely worth owning if you're a Hong Kong fan."
3,Great Action...... BAD DVD,"High Risk is an action packed movie. Not like anything Hollywood has to offer. This is real HK action. Jet Li plays the role of a Stunt-double/ Bodyguard to Jacky Cheung. The first part of the movie really sets the pace of the rest of the film with explosive action. There are some great fight clips and lots of comedy. This is not a Hollywood movie so the effects are not perfect. One of the coolest clips was of the car in the elevator.The DVD had no options other than the choice of Cantonese or Mandarin it did not even have a menu. Further more the subtitles where small and hard to read and where fixed English and Chinese, so you could not turn them off if you wanted. Other than that the picture quality was Great.(I took of 2 stars for the lack of options and the hard to read subtitles)"
3,I preferred High Risk!,"I bought this DVD hoping it would have a subtitle option (English subtitles w original soundtrack), but it doesn't. I also own a video of the original movie, ""High Risk,"" which I find more entertaining. The dubbed dialogue on the DVD is REALLY silly (as is the movie, which is OK). . .a few of the lines are funnier than the original, but so many hilarious lines are changed (to only marginally funny). Jacky Cheung's real voice is way funnier than the dubbed one. PLUS annoying rap soundtrack on the dubbed version, ugh."
5,"Funny, and Crazy","i liked the martial arts the most in this movie, I can say that Jet Li is one of my favorite martial Artists. this is a basic Chinese rip off of Die hard, but it's still cool...don't forget funny as well."
2,One of the worst,One of the worst jet li fighting movies we've seen. Better than the hitman but still bad. If you want a good fighting movie don't get this movie but if you are into explosions and guns and slight comedy then this is for you. There was only 1 full fight scene Jet li did and it was lame.
4,"Jackie Chan, Jet Li need I say more.","High Risk is very similar to Die Hard, but it has a twist of humor uncommon in action flicks. I will admit it was unrealistic, but Jet Li and Jackie Chan both lived up to their reputations in this performance. The thing that makes the movie enjoyable is that it does not take itself seriously."
3,This movie got a bit confused somewhere down the line.,"This movie opens with a school bus full of children being blown up by terrorists (establishing the revenge sub-plot), and then suddenly goes into comedy where Jet Li is a clumsy action star's stunt double, and then goes into a semi-serious, violent Die Hard clone. If it had been funny or serious all the way through it would have been better, but the drama-comedy-drama-action-comedy is a bit weak. At least you cheer when the bad guys get it anyway."
1,Meltdown,"First, this film is not in Cantonese as mentioned on Amazon, only in English (poorly dubbed).Second, it's a ridiculous satire of Jackie Chan & Bruce Lee and disgusting.Third, Jackie Cheung, imitating Jackie Chan, looks so silly it is difficult to believe that this movie was ever released.Fourth, the only reason to see this movie, if at all, is Jet Li (& that's the reason I bought it) although he does not play as important a role as if I would have liked.In conclusion: Don't buy it!"
3,Mediocre HK action flick.,"Given the quality of other HK action films made during this time - I'd have to say this one fails as one for the most part. It does have it's moments and they are some brilliant moments at that. However, the ""stuff"" that holds these moments together is a mixture of lampooning comedy (at the expense of ""big brother"" Jackie Chan) and really pathetic plot devices. I saw this film as High Risk on an imported DVD. It had burned-in subtitles that were difficult to read at times. I would be really surprised if this DVD was of the same print. This is probably dubbed (it doesn't specify right now as I write this) and seriously cut. Once I receive my copy, I'll have to edit my review to add the facts on this edition. Even the import DVD suffers some minor cuts. The best reason to get this DVD is Jet Li's head superimposed on Donnie Yen's body."
1,Not worth the money,"This item did not even last a year before it would not light for any reason. New butane, no spark. Could not get it to light at all. No way to bypass the lighter and use a match or any other means of lighting. Now I have the refills and no light and don't plan to buy another of this brand."
1,"Boo, Down with Whitman","This is the worst poem ever written. I was writting beter poetry when I was three!! Don't buy this ""book"" (It's long enough to be called one) it is the worst investment ever."
5,Excellent piece of literature.,Excellent reading. Very well written and easy to stay involved. I recommend this to everyone who wants to improve their vocabulary or just learn about the depth of detail that exist to those who look for it.
2,Typographical Errors,"I LOVE the poetry, but this edition has typographical errors, some of them pretty important. An example: In the middle of section 6, a line reads ""And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of grass,"" which should read ""beautiful uncut hair of graves."" I like that Dover makes literature available at a reasonable price, but in this case I think one can find a better edition."
5,An Alarming Album for Children,"When I was a kid, we checked this RECORD out from the library all the time. MP3s are so much more convenient, but I'm interested here in reviewing the music, not the medium. This album was one of my favorites. As an adult I'm surprised at how genuinely provocative the music is. Terrific! No wonder I enjoyed it so much! Music marketed to children is usually very boring. What this album lacks in virtuosity (and no one would argue that the performance is musically brilliant) it makes up for easily in wit. The humor is mostly about bodily functions, which is perfect for kids under about 10 years old. It also touches on sensitive issues like sibling rivalry and gender roles, but it's never preachy, just honest and funny.If only there were excellent videos to accompany the songs! I don't know if a modern 6 year old could sit still and listen to a song without having a video to watch at the same time."
2,Tedious,"A tedious, draggy and repetitive film that does not live up to expectations. Cannot recommend, unless you have a specialized interest in Hebrew language movies as a general cinematic category."
5,Verification,This book is a great base for those who do not wish to receive the torment of organized religion forcing individuals to accept their faith or become a bane to society. Within it are numerous example of how to lead a non-religous life while still embrace morality and tolerance. I reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to find an outlet to repressed opinions and didnt know how to properly express them or would like to know more about being a humanist.
1,Nations represent the uniqueness of their people,"Nations represent the uniqueness of thier people. Should all people of this world conform to one way of life?also, consider the economic consequences"
5,Great Traditional Cuban Son,"Conjunto Progreso is by far the most succesful Cuban Son group in the United States.this CD takes you back to the cuba of old, with great classics done with a live feel.No over produced material here. the problem with a lot salsa and latin releases is that there over produced. this CD sounds like recording of old, the way it should be done.I recommend ""Masters of Cuban Soul"" to anybody looking for real Cuban Music."
4,"Vintage info, but nothing about newer C5 and C6 Corvettes","I ordered this...but I didn't pay attention to the date it was made (mid '90s). So, I was disappointed in that regard, since none of the best features were shown for modern Corvettes (C5 and C6).Having visited the Bowling Green KY factory a few times over the years where all Corvettes are built, I can only tell you how wonderful their processes are! I recommend this video for history and ""John Ratzenberger's Made in America"" Season 1 for the terrific video of the wonderful building process of America's only true sportscar."
5,THIS IS PROGRESS !,"I couldn't believe that this kind of hard rock was still being made in the nineties. Diamond Head were dead alright,but they have come back and how ! The songs are well-crafted with odd timings and the band sounds heavier than ever. No doubt about it these are fine musicians and Sean Harris still knows how to combine power and passion in his singing. Metallica's Lars Ulrich can be proud now !"
1,Progress indeed. The bad kind.,"Like the other reviewer said this is Diamond Head's reunion album, and what a terrible reunion album it is. These guys proved they were heavy metal gods on their first two albums, and everything else ended up being complete crap. There is no excuse for a band being so good and then becoming so bad. With the live album that came shortly after, they became even WORSE! This is UNBELIEVABLE! Much like Metallica whom they inspired, Diamond Head got on a downward spiral and never bothered doing anything to fix the problem. Get Lightning To The Nations/The White Album. Get Living On Borrowed Time. They are GREAT albums. But, GET NOTHING ELSE BY THIS BAND."
3,PERFECT AMALGAM OF POPULAR 80S HAIR METAL STYLES,"The songcraft and production are solid, and the band is consistently in the pocket throughout this recording. It is evident how well DH has assimilated 80s pop-metal influences: Aerosmith, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Van Hagar and even a little Kingdom Come all come through in the writing. I too, believe that a band should mature musically, but therein also lies the rub: this does not sound anything like the band from which Metallica drew their primary inspiration. It's great background music, but by going this commercial route, I think that Diamond Head lost their original audience. Unlike Metallica, which remained stylistically recognizable as Metallica throughout their career, Diamond Head's music on this album no longer demonstrates a distinctive, recognizable style. Although the music is very good, I've yet to find any track that truly reaches out and ""grabs"" me."
5,Multiple Creative Talent,"I have gone back to this book over the years as an excellent account of examples of multiple creative talent.Part One: Talent, Genius and Multiple Creativity(covers the writer-composer, the actor-painter, etc.)Part Two: The Painter who Writes(covers Leonardo, Michelangelo, Vasari and Cellini, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Whistler, Klee, etc.)Part Three: The Writer who Paints(covers Goethe, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Victor Hugo, Thackeray, Hesse, Strindberg, D.H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, Trakl, etc.)A fascinating read and well illustrated with 149 plates, 23 in Color."
3,A ... dragon slayer?,"Second LP from Helios' Chrome, after Damon Edge' death in 1995. Like Retro-Transmission, Tidal Forces is a mid-pleasure. Some songs are astonishing, but others are too ambient ... . I mean good ambient music are enjoyable, but some stuff on that CD sounds like Casio King Crimson. Funny thing is that old collaborators John and Hilary Stench are back for the rythm section. Anyway, this album is not bad. Unfortunately, the cover art is."
3,Chrome - 'Tital Forces' (Man's Ruin),"I ended up liking this Chrome reunion disc more than I had expected to.Three original members are present,Helios Creed on guitar,samples and had taken over the vocals,Hillary Stench on bass and Johnny Stench on drums.My only regret is that I wasn't able to catch this band on tour.It's great to know that Chrome has returned with their trademark mutated guitar playing,deranged vocals and off-the-wall lyrics.Key tracks would be the eerie ""No Humans Allowed"",""A Parallel Washing"",the sonically insane ""Descent Into The Lower Worlds"" and ""Fudge Bunny"".So,come on and join the Chrome family to enjoy some really fine post-industrial psychedlic mayham.If you're into bands like Throbbing Gristle,Monster Magnet or Kluster,you just might want to snatch up a copy of this CD."
3,ouch! made my little girl cry! then I fixed it.,This is great because it works and the price is right but my little 2-year-old is terrified of it from the one time she tried to put it on. It's so tight on the ears that it hurts. I wasn't sure it was durable enough to stretch but I managed to bend the middle metal piece a little flatter and now the earpieces sit separated enough that they don't pinch. My little girl is still afraid to wear it but I think she'll warm up once she sees that others aren't commenting on how it hurts anymore.
2,Uncomfortable earpiece,"I was excited to get this for my 3 yr old granddaughter. Unfortunately, the earpiece won't stay on. For some reason, they are at a weird angle and are uncomfortable--aside from flipping off. She won't use it."
2,Great until it comes apart!,"My daughter (age 6) loves to play with this when she pretends to be a vet. It works great (the dog even learned to tolerate her listening to his heartbeat).However, the plastic circle that covers the head of the stehoscope likes to come off and it takes me about 20 minutes to put it back on (as it has to slip very precisely into a very small slot). Without the plastic piece it doesn't work."
4,A good stethoscope.,"I really like this stethoscope. The only reason I didn't rate it for 5 stars, is because it's actually very tight on the ears. I'm not sure if it will loosen up as we use it, so we'll see.As for the durability and level of fun/education it's really great. I bought it for my kids for Christmas and they love it. You can hear your heart very good. The kids really love playing doctor and it's hilarious to watch my son (6 years old) take them off his ears and drape the whole thing around his neck like real doctor does."
1,Disappointed,The stethoscope is very tight fitting for my 4 1/2 yr old grandsons and they cannot hear the actual heartbeat -as advertised. Disappointed in this product and it's advertising.
2,Not a toy,"Are all stethoscopes like this?The ear tips are too tight and doesn't fit well no mattter how I adjusted it. Those hurt the ears!Volume of the heartbeat was fine if the chest piece is placed right but if the chest piece bumps against anything else, it'd get really loud! Was purchased for my 2 yr old but I guess with the uncomfortable fit and loudness, I won't be letting her play with this at all.Will check out something else."
3,Be careful the ear pieces aren't secure,"I bought 2 as christmas presents for my daughers. You can really hear your heart beat. It fits really snug when kids have it on so you may want to bend it out a tad bit. The only problem i had was that the white ear pieces come off very easily. when my daughter went to put the stethoscope on, one of the white earbuds came right off. Once we found it (its really tiny)i tried screwing it back on. Its a little more secure but not as secure as it should be. i tightened the other stethoscope ear buds as well. i find that they are loose already so it helps if you tighten them before giving to children. Im afraid if they become loose again it will post a hazard and get stuck in my childs ear. Definitely not recommended for children under 5."
3,Looks authentic but doesn't really work :(,"I really liked the idea of my kids being able to listen to their heart beat while playing doctor, and this product seemed perfect. Sadly i couldn't hear a thing with it. I had better luck just putting my ear to their chest. This toy does deliver in terms of kid-sizing, and construction (easy to take apart and put back together) and looks authentic -- just wish that it was. Then again, perhaps for what i paid i can't expect more?"
4,Good product,"My daughter loves to play doctor, so I decided to get this for her so she could feel more like a doctor. She's not used to putting them in her ears yet, but she wears them around her ne ck and pretends I have a baby in my tummy."
2,rental,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's very amateurish and slow and reading a good book would have been better time spent.
4,The Trap,"The Trap, to me, is such a heart rendering story that brought me to tears. Mr. Glgovac did a wonderful job of a man in a delicate situation & was most believable as a devoted husband with morals that he had to decide his what to do. His wife delivered a great profile of her support but could not settle the delema.A note on box that it is all in Serbian would help a potential buyer. I am lucky I could cope woth both.Serbian is spoken much faster than when I was last in the country. When watching this film be sure you can concentrate with no interuptions."
4,Great book,"This is another great book from Thubten Chodron. This book is much more focused on the Buddhist perspectives than ""Working with Anger."" So if you are not looking for the Buddhist perspective/teachings this isn't for you. It goes over the 4 noble truths, the 8 fold path, etc. A little mroe Buddhist than what I was looking for but still good info and perspective. May not be for everyone."
4,Miss Withers mystery is a fun read,"PLOT:When Miss Withers doesn't receive a Christmas card from a former neighbor who was extremely diligent about such things she begins to investigate what happened to the woman. She soon discovers links to other disappearing women, all of whom had come in to some money, and connected to a luxurious hotel in midtown New York. Donning the disguise of a wealthy woman, she checks into the hotel and with the aid of her missing neighbor's niece, discovers a Bluebeard might be at work.REVIEW:A fun read, not too deep (not deep at all, actually), and if you're a fan of Miss Withers, it will satisfy you. For others it might be too flippant and full of cliches (probably even for the late 1940's when it was written.)"
4,Pretty Strong with good lyrics couple cheesy tracks,"Finally there are some boyz who can rap startin to come out and wait a minute it's actually Christian! This album is good but not great Knowdaverbs throws some good ryming together with a positive message. But of course you always ""learn somethin"" after your first one and there were some definite cheese tracks on this one I like the appearences of Coffee from Grits as well as one of the out of Eden Girls. I'll definitly buy his next one!"
2,"OKAY PRODUCTION, GOOD LYRICS.","Sounds like rap/rock. I like some of the songs. I gave the CD to my cousin, though. I like Bobby Digital better."
1,This is my story!,"I heard this CD and I personally think that it was garbage. The beats are whack and his lyrics are whack. I understand he trying to win souls but it's not working. I couldn't even listen to the whole Cd because it was so stupid. Don't even think about getting the other one. That one is just as bad. If I was a christian and this was the first CD I heard... I wouldn't have gotten saved at that point. Stick with good artist like Da Truth, cross movement, and others. Please do not buy this CD."
4,Knowdaverbs Is A Great Emcee,"Wow, this CD is really cool. I don't like hip-hop/rap music much, but I really dig this dude's rhymes. Not only is he smooth and fast, he's incredibly intelligent. Some rappers spit out a bunch of ridiculous lines that hardly make sense, but Knowdaverbs uses five-dollar words and plenty of expression to get across messages with spiritual overtones very plainly. I would highly recommend Knowdaverb's freshman release to all who love God and want to hear a rapper really put his heart into what he does. 4 stars."
4,Pretty durn good,"This is a fun album by Knowdaverbs. He has good danceable beats for most of his songs and lyrics are entertaining not to mention spiritual of course. Fav 2 songs: *Equeena and *Good Measure. Others include *Strange Dames *The Syllabus *Call of the Dung Beetle. I only give 4 stars b/c it sometimes seems that Knowdaverbs has kind of a talkie feel to his rap and it gets kind of monotone after awhile. Also, some of the beats were kind of bland. But other than that he's fun, check him out!"
3,Eh. I'm not enthusiastic.,"This book has many practical tips for those who have decided upon a divorce and who want to continue to be cordial for the sake of their children. If that's your situation, I think you'll find it useful.However, I am wary of its use for anyone who is indecisive. Divorce and separation do not necessarily produce friendship between parents or even closure. Make really sure that you've exhausted your options (therapy, counseling, spiritual guidance, etc. etc.) before presuming that a divorce is your best option.I would also disagree with the idea that a cordial divorce changes rather than destroys a family. My ex-husband and I are not family anymore. Legally, morally and ethically, our bond has been dissolved. What remains is our desire to give our child as much stability, guidance and happiness as we can. We cooperate in that way, but we are no longer family."
1,Should only be used in extreeme situations,"My parents read this book as they were considering separating. It convinced them that there was no reason to resolve their differences, and that our family would be somehow stronger. It absolutely gives unhappy people the unfounded expectation that if they can just be friendly with each other, negative effects can be completely avoided.In the end it made my parents separation all the more painful for me and my adult siblings, because it built an expectation that divorce would be easy on everyone. When it wasn't, the only response was to blame us kids, because they were working really hard at their ""good"" divorce."
4,Excellent guide,"A well written tool to guide you through the difficulty of divorce. Ms. Ahrons articulately reviews the history of divorce and in the process attempts to remove the stigma and negative stereotypes associated with divorce. It is a hopeful, useful guide in how to end a marriage well while beginning a new chapter in life."
4,Another great Newman movie,"Great story, great acting (not only Newman and Fields, the entire cast is excellent). Had not seen it in years but it was just as great as it was the first time."
3,"Classic Lanz, but is lacking the personal side of Lanz.","Being a big fan of David Lanz, I was eager to hear this CD. I first heard of it through the website, The Romantic Piano, (members.xoom.com/sims_music/piano/). I was not overly impressed with the CD though. It is straight cuts from his concerts. The album does not contain any of the commentary that make his concerts so unique. For anyone looking for classic Lanz this is it."
1,Not sealed for outside use!,"Bought the light. Just what I was looking for. Installed easily. Configuration was a pain, just as the other reviews say, but I was OK with that. The light worked great, until it rained. Then it stopped working because the little box which houses the motion sensor FILLED UP WITH WATER! Odd that it was not sealed, even though it is an outdoor fixture. I'll be returning it."
2,Manual doesn't match item,"Probably an engineering change. It's OK, but hard to configure. And why should I have to configure a light fixture?"
2,Not for the fain of heart...,"It's not bronze, as the ad said. As others here mentioned, the tiny flimsy knobs are really difficult to identify and to use. My light does not work with a strong bulb but it works with two 40w bulbs. It's a pain to adjust. Don't buy."
3,It's OK...,"First off it is not all metal construction, which is why I purchased this. The motion sensor part and the arm that holds it are plastic, and the rest is cheap pot metal. Not what I consider high quality (per the description). Also it appears as you can do motion or dusk-to-dawn, not both at the same time. 8 minutes is the longest you can set it for to stay on after motion has stopped. Economical with power usage I give it that only I like to keep the light on for just a tad longer. Durability is my main question right now."
4,It is good in that price,"I bought this product last month, and it is easy to be installed. I am happy with the product, after installed in my front door, it work good.It has three small buttons can judge the sense of light, time period and day light. That is enought for normal home useage.The reason I didnot put 5 star is: If it came with light bulds, I can immediately use it, it would be better. Otherwise, I need went to shopping for buld, it cost some time. :)"
5,works great!,Checked to make sure this item would fit my truck. Description said it would and it does. works great! holds my tailgate up and goes up by itself. awesome!
2,"Weird story, great pictures.","I picked up this book for my son at a library book sale without reading it, I liked the art work. When I first read it I couldn't believe that this weird little story was actually published. The mean, nasty dad is just too much. The story is too weird. Perhaps it's a cultural thing and Americans just don't get the humor of it? I don't know... I like that it makes children think about what it must be like for animals in the zoo but I don't care for the characters or the story. The art work is quite nice but overall it's just too weird. And not weird in a good way."
3,I saw it way back when,"..along with Jaws 3D and Ice pirates(?) and this was the better of the 3, it is a totaly B movie, but It has its own charm. I liked the vehicle designs and concept behind it, theres plenty of movies as bad(but good!) out right now in theatres..grab some beer and your pals, have a laugh its all good."
4,Not as bad as 'Men In Black',"The movie is kind of fun. Not bad for a 'B' movie and not as bad as 'Men In Black' This one I would at least watch again without trying to chew my arm off. (yep you guessed it , I cant say the same for 'MIB')"
2,Wow! An action movie with a pacing problem.,"This movie has a serious pacing problem. It runs very slow in most of the non-action parts, but runs quickly in the action sequences. The dialog is terrible. Give nervous actors non-natural dialog and the whole movie looks more like a bad high school production. Molly Ringwald character tends to ramble on and on. Midway through, the movie forgets it is in 3D. One sequence in particular, walking across the desert, goes on and on.I watched Spacehunter in 1983 in the theater. It was my first 3D movie. I thought it was a good b-movie at the time. Viewing the same movie now shows me it had lots of ideas but not much money. Somehow, the non action sequences go slowly and the characters are just doing exposition instead of reacting to what happens."
1,Don't buy it Until they Clean it Up!!!!!,I enjoyed the movie alot but I could of enjoyed more but I got distracted many times on how bad the quality of the DVD was. It's very grainy in 95% of the movie and the other 5% was very good....just can't understand on why the company that copy these DVD's do not due a quality check....very disappointed.
2,"It is pretty bad, even for a B movie","This movie is so bad that it is almost fun, not quite but almost. The movie is about a down on his luck adventurer/bounty hunter named Wolff (Peter Strauss) who must find three beauties who have been stranded on a planet and captured by some weirdo named Overdog (Michael Ironside). Along the way Wolff meets up with Nikki (Molly Ringwald) who is a local urchin who agrees to help him for food. I won't bore you with anymore about the plot, because there isn't any more.This movie should of been a career killer to everyone involved so I'm guessing that Ringwald already had signed the contract for Sixteen Candles and well, Peter Strauss' career is what it is. In the end I would pass on this film unless you have a desire to see what Molly Ringwald did before she was a famous or unless you are a lover of really bad B movies. Why this never showed up on MST 3000 I will never know."
3,"""I never said I don't eat dog, I just said I don't eat it that much!""","Space Hunter, was for many years a movie I had on tape and would watch any time I was down with the flu. It was fun and Sci-Fi, and I always felt better when watching it. It had been many years since I had seen it, and last night I rented the download from Video on Demand at Amazon to my TiVo.So here's the deal, it wasn't near as good as I remembered; the FX are a joke by today's standards. Flash light on the air bubbles for stars, etc. It is a cheese covered corn-dog of a film, still fun but not nutritious. But for those who are fans of Sci-Fi video games, I think this is still a fun ride, and really I think the script would be exactly translatable.So if you are in the mood for a low budget `80s ""B"" movie Sci-fi, this is just the ticket, if you want great Sci-fi, keep looking.2 * for nostalgia's sake."
3,Space Hunter,I thought it would be a little better than it is but it is still a pretty good B Movie..Actors did a pretty good job.
3,Fair movie,"It was basic, but the acting will pass. It still reminds me of a sort of Mad Max type film. Pure 1980's look and feel to it. It's worth renting and watching once if you are a Scifi fan."
3,Review of Spacehunter,"Kind of like ""Mad Max"" in space. A sci-fi B movie but I find it entertaining. (But then I like Sci Fi B movies)"
3,Kind of fun,"I remembered this as being a pretty good film or its genre when it first came out so I took a chance when I found it a good price. I wasn't disappointed, it is pretty silly but lots of fun if you take it for what it is pure science fiction with a second tier class of stars. Molly Ringwald shows some of the talent that would make here such a success in her teen years. It isn't Star Wars but it is fun."
4,This is the best gate for your money!,"We bought this gate to keep our toddler from going down the hallway. It has been a wonderful tool and I highly recommend it. The only thing that has happened is every once in a while the pressure mountings seem to get loose. However, it doesn't take anything to tighten them up again. The gate has never budged as far as coming lose from the wall. We have been very, very pleased with this gate and it swings open and closed at least 200 times a day at our house!!"
1,Poor design,"This gate seemed good when I first installed it but, after 3 months the small pieces of plastic that hold the gate in place when closed has broken. That is one of the few pieces of plastic on this gate but in a very crucial spot. The foot pedal was also very hard to use and eventually made the gate hands free no longer as you would often need to support yourself before slamming down on the pedal. I am very disappointed in this gate and would not recommend it for anyone. I normally assume that you get what you pay for, so I expected a lot more from this gate."
5,Best Gate Made,"This is the third gate we have purchased--- And the best at that. It is easy to install, and easy to add an extension, is sturdy, and simple as pie to open and close.I recommend this gate to anyone who thinks that there current gate has flaws. Because, this one has absolutely no flaws."
3,Not good for stairs,"While this is a high quality gate and likely works very well for doorways, I have found that it is a trip hazard when used to block stairs in my home. The gate has a wide threshold that is about 2"" high. As an adult, I hang onto the rail when stepping over it at the top of the stairs. It is extremely difficult for the 1.5 year-old in the house to get over the threshold and down the first stair - he has to hang onto the gate and usually has to sit and pull himself down. For him it is like stepping over something big to go down something steep."
5,"Great gate, easy to use!","Couldn't be more simple in design and yet very effective in keeping your little one in or out of certain rooms. Foot pedal for opening really does make this ""hands free"", which is essential when your hands are full of baby or dishes or laundry or whatever all the time. Highly recommend this gate!"
5,No more dog problems,"Our French Bull dog had a bad habit, he liked to sleep on our bed and get hair all over it, go into the bathroom and eat the toilet paper. On top of that he thought he ran the house. Since I installed this gate not only does it keep him out of our bedroom and bathroom, he now knows that he know longer runs the house. His area is now confined to the living room and kitchen where his food is and not the whole apartment. I love this gate because we now control him and not the other way around. The gate itself is very well constructed and easy to install. Best investment we ever made."
4,"Nice and sturdy, but make sure it fits your needs","This is a nice and solid gate. Installation is a bit tricky but once you have it up, it's not going anywhere. BE CAREFUL, the foot operation on this product makes it not practical for top or bottom of stairs, and it is really only wide enough for a doorway, not a hall way. I had to order the additional gate widner for this for where I wanted it."
4,Good buy,This is great buy. The only reason why it's not a 5 stars is coz you have to buy the extension for it. I don't think it fits a standard walk way/doorway and I live in a pretty new house.
4,Keeps our dogs safe,This gate helps keep our dogs safe from charging out the front door when company comes. It is sturdy and easily moveable. We don't have the knee knocker option but I think it would be a great addition.I always know where the dogs are and it really helped during puppy training my french bulldog puppies recently.
5,The best baby gate for doorways,"Personally, I dreaded shopping for a baby gate. We have heard and experienced so many horror stories. We finally sucked it up and basically picked this one for the foot pedal alone. It has been a dream all the way around.It took about ten minutes to install, only because I was a dunce and was trying to make it more difficult than it was. Hold the gate up, screw the spacers out evenly, done!It has held up well -- very solidly constructed -- and it's so easy to use. No headaches trying to get through the gate, even when my hands are full. It keeps the dogs out and him in. So far he hasn't figured out how to open it, but even if he did I don't think he would be strong/heavy enough to push the pedal down (it takes a good amount of stepping power).We are thrilled with this purchase and recommend it highly."
5,EXCELLENT GATE,"We bought this gate on a recommendation from a friend, whose toddler is quite active and climbing everywhere. This was definitely one of the best purchases we've made. It is easy to install (NO TOOLS!) and even easier to use. It's high enough that my toddler isn't trying to climb over it, and sturdy enough to where she isn't shaking on it to make it come loose. It is an excellent gate."
5,Great Product,"I just purchased two of these gates & think that they are great. It is easy to operate, durable, and attractive. The swinging gate is a must - climbing over non-swinging gates gets old really fast. My only concern is that a toddler may figure out how to open the gate when he is a little older, perhaps towards three when he sees that it requires one to step onto the foot pad. It does, however, require you to push the foot pad down perhaps a little farther than a toddler will be able to."
5,Buy THIS gate!,"We put it up in our mail hallway to the kitchen. When we carry the baby, it's easy to step on the foot pedal and open the gate with your knee. EXCELLENT gate! (we have 1 extension).It's pricey, but we've found this to be the best gate!"
4,TITLE SAYS IT ALL!,"I had registered for this gate after hearing high recommendations from my mom who works at a private daycare and has several there. Luckily for me, we received it as a shower gift and it is one of the best gifts that is actually true to its name. The foot pedal allows the gate to swing in either direction allowing me to get through a doorway which blocks off our loving black lab/retriever mix while still holding our baby or anything else for that matter. Prior to our bundle of joy arriving I had another gate that would repeatedly fall down and was a pain to lock in place. I did however need ""1"" extension for our doorway. We have definitely got our friend's money's worth out of this awesome gift and would in turn purchase it for another expectant parent or even someone with just pets!!"
5,Exceptional!,"I bought the gate to confine my dog after he had knee surgery. This is the 3'rd gate I've purchased, and by far the best. It opens easily with adult pressure on the foot pedal & a light knee to the gate. Great when my hands are full! I can swing it shut with my foot fast enough that my dog doesn't escape.I'm pretty hopeless mechanically, but the instructions were clear and I had it up in less than 10 minutes. My niece is almost 3, and she hasn't been able to get it open."
4,so far so good,"So far so good my two year olds can't get it open. They love to slam it though, and we have had a bit of a problem with closing it since they have been so rough on it. Overall we love it. It is much easier to navigate then our last gate (especially since it goes into the kitchen and I usually have my hands full when I am trying to go through it). We have an old house that probably doesn't have an even doorway and this gate can be adjusted to accommodate that. I would recommend it to a friend."
5,jnkmom,"This gate is GREAT for PETS and KIDS. We bought two of thesegates for our daughter when she was a toddler and now use it to keep our dog in the kitchen while we are away or during the night. It has been in place for over a year now, and gets a TON of use. It loosens up from time to time, but it is no big deal to tighten it (my 8 year old son likes to swing in the opening). We currently have 2 extensions on it, and have had no problem with them other than when we first got our Italian Greyhound he could get through the gate on the extension side, once he got bigger this wasn't a problem. Our 3 1/2 year old still doesn't have the strength to open the gate on her own (she weighs 30 pounds) so it keeps her out of the kitchen while I am cooking dinner. I only wish they could make slightly wider extensions so I could place a third one between my dining room and living room, for now I have a tall step over kind of gate there."
2,Possible hHazard when used for stairs,"I bought this to be used on my stairways. No problem while going up the stairs, but while coming down it's difficult to push the pedal with baby in hand (or even with hands free) as there is hardly any spacee between the pedal and the stair."
2,"Does it's job, but needs some improvements","We needed a gate to separate the great room from the hallway with all the bedrooms and bathrooms off it to keep my baby and dogs out of there when we weren't watching. This one does an alright job. It doesn't look terrible (like some of the gates I've seen) and it's high enough to keep my large dogs from trying to jump over.The gate is opened by pushing the foot pedal on the bottom. The pedal is a bit unstable and the mechanism that opens the gate is in the rod above the pedal, pushing down allows the nubs on the door to come free. Unfortunately ours make a really loud squeak when you do this, and I can't figure out how to oil the interior mechanism to keep it from doing this. Because of this, we have to leave the gate open while the baby is napping to avoid waking her up with it. I also don't like the bottom brace because it's easy to stub your toe on when you're distracted.Overall it's functional, but the squeak limits its usefulness for me."
2,Extensions are mandatory,"Extensions should automatically come with this gate because no one has a doorway small enough for the gate to work by itself. The gate is flimsy if you extend the rods to the full capacity, so basically it doesn't extend to 34"" without jeopardizing the security of the gate. The gate only extends to 31"" safely. Overall I returned both gates for the Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate which is better because the extensions were already included in the price."
3,Extensions:(,We bought this gate and two extenders.Then our 98lb nephew to put it to the test.Hes too light to push it open so I know my son is safe with it for atleast 3-4 years but I'll be jumping up to open it all the time.We left it open at nap time and found that he could use his hands to swing on it without the gate slipping from the wall.This told me that if my son runs head first it wont fall down so easy.Its a really sturdy safe gate.I'm going to have to give up the gate because theres a gap between my wall and the bars that looks too big for my comfort.I love the gate itself because it has passed my nephews distruction test.
1,Important Safety Tip,"Yeah, thanks, Egon. The instructions mention quite clearly that this gate is NOT recommended for the top of the stairs. It would have been better for me if I had known this BEFORE I ordered the gate and began to install it, though. Nowhere does this info appear in the Amazon product information.I'm sure this is a great gate for what it is, it's just that it's not what I need. And I would have appreciated knowing that before I bought it."
3,"great gate, but...","This is a great gate, but if you put it a doorway that has a door, you can't close the door all the way."
3,not for use at top of stairs,"It was not stated that this is not for the use of top of stairs. That was what I wanted it for, and it wasnt until I started reading the directions, that I found that out. [...]"
5,"Easy, quick, and safe!","We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight."
2,harder to use than the older model,"i bought one of these gates in 2007 and it has the kneepad on it- it was great; easy to use, easy to install, has held up well. with a new baby, i need another one so i purchased this one since it is a newer model. this was still easy to install but the foot pedal keeps getting stuck and it makes it very difficult to open the gate in one step. i find myself having to stomp on the pedal 3 or 4 times to get it to open. i'm not happy with the new design of the gate versus the 2007 version."
2,Foot pedal broke!,"Loved the idea of having a hands free gate, but after using for a couple months the foot pedal started to come apart. Now the gate is extremely difficult to open and close. It has become a huge pain to use, I'll be switching back to my old hand operated gate that actually works!"
2,bad design,"This gate is made of steel but the very thing that keeps it closed is made of plastic!!! I am talking about the two protruding plastic things by the step and directly above it where you would place your hand to swing open. When these break off, they are not reparable. I cannot superglue. There is no glue that will glue the very thing that makes this gate close. BAD gate. Also, this gate has the tendency to swing back at you. Kids got hit in the face. You just need to make sure both plastic things touch the other side of the gate which causes it to close."
5,"Great gate, had it over a year and it stills works great","We bought this gate to keep our son out of the kitchen. It was very easy to install. The adjustable screws are gerat if you have molding around the base of your walls. All 4 points of contact adjust seperatly so the moldings doesn't get in the way.The foot pedal is very easy to use and is great when you have your hands full. Some reviewers have comented on the durability of the gate and pedal. We have used our gate for over a year and not had any problem with anything breaking. It is in a pretty high traffic area and shows no signs of wear and tear.Our son is a climber and he can't climb over the gate and even though he has figured out how the gate works he simply is not heavy enough to use the pedal.The only word of caution is if you have a door way that is wider than normal it may not fit, so check the specs before buying."
2,I sent it back,"The foot pedal is a great idea, which is what drew me to purchase the gate. However the gate opening was EXTREMELY narrow! To fit through the gate you would need to be slender and not be carrying anything, especially not an infant car seat. The gate itself also did not fit my stair opening, which is also not a wide space. There is an additional piece that could be purchased for wide spaces, but at this point I no longer wanted to keep the item, so I sent it back."
1,Great at first BUT...,"We bought the gate so that our three older children did not have to climb over a gate. They are 9,6 and 3 years old. Our 19 month old was able to master this gate in three weeks by watching everyone else open the gate. He is only 28 pounds but by jumping on the pedal and pushing the door, he is able to open the gate making it usless."
2,Wears Out Easily,"The gate was great at first. Very east to install and operate. After 4 months of use the footpdeal began to bend and eventually broke off, rendering the gate useless. I never bought another one."
5,Great gate,"We originally purchased this gate for our dogs, we restricted them to a specific area in the house most of the other gates did not extend the length that we needed, with this gate we were able to get the extensions and it's perfect, it also looks great, we always get comments from our guests as were we got it. It's also very easy to use, we are getting another for another section, and now with the new baby on the way will be getting that same gate."
3,gap in the gate,"Rachel, I am the assocaite who helped you in the store I misplaced your number but I did write an email to the first years company and this was their response ""Once the gate is completley tightened into a doorway, the top protion of the gate will come together."" I doubt from our conversation that this will be helpful and I'm sorry but maybe one of the parents on the review can be of more help."
3,Top not latching,"We bought this gates and all seemed great until my husband realized the top doesn't latch. It was completely mounted in the doorway, but there still was a large gap of about 1"". There was no way that the top latch was going to connect with out deliberately bending the entire gate. Has anybody else had this problem? I went back to the store and they all had the same gap and the salesperson said hers from a while back didn't have a gap. HELP!"
1,baby got stuck,"I owned this gate with my 2nd child. It broke after only 4 months. I tried it again with my 3rd child thinking that perhaps it was just a fluke that it broke. However, it is EXTREMEMLY DANGEROUS. My son is 12 months old, and in the past week, he has gotten his knee stuck 5 times! Thankfully, somebody was with me each time, so one adult could pry at the bars of the gate, while the other greased his knee with butter and gently tried to pull it out. Tonight, however, it really hurt his knee/thigh. VERY BAD PRODUCT. THIS GATE HURTS KIDS!"
1,NOT Durable,"Install gate 4 months ago in a nursery at our church and everyone including myself thought it was nice, easy to use and fit our needs. But after last Sunday I found it laying<br />aside, so I ask what's wrong? The lady said it quit working, and would not unlock. I took it apart to see what failed. I found the unlocking bar broke at the bottom end. I was made of very thin metal. What good is a gate made to last many years on the outside,but won't take daily use for 4 months? Sorry the product was not worth the price I paid for it and I feel it was just another ripoff."
2,The newer 'arched top' gate does NOT have the roll-over threshold at the bottom.,We have an older version of this gate that we really like. The one without the arch on the top of the gate part.It has a plastic molded ramp-like piece that fits onto the bottom so that things can be rolled through the gate easily. Its great for our daughter that pushes things with wheels around.The newer version of this gate (same Y3600 model number) that has the arched gate does NOT include the ramp-like threshold and simply has a metal strut that goes across the bottom.It isnt roll-friendly. Its being returned and we are going to look for the another one of the older ones.
4,Just What I Needed...,"I needed to section off my kitchen from the living room so I could monitor my puppy better and this gate was one of my best investments.The pressure mounts don't scuff the walls, and it's so incredibly convenient to be able to walk through it.An added bonus, the kids know to stay out of the kitchen too, say if we're cooking.I haven't had anything break on it and my 45lb. dog hasn't knocked it over or jumped over it yet. The only thing I will complain about is that its a little bit of a task to tighten the mounts. Other than that though, great product!"
5,Pleased with width of opening,I have researched every gate on the market at this point. So far we are extremely happy with this gate. We wanted pressure mounted gates but I was concerned that the opening of this particular gate would not be wide enough for my husband. I thought that he would have to turn sideways to get through the door and would not like it once used on a regular basis. So far we are very satisfied customers and my husband can walk straight through the opening so the width meets our needs better than I anticipated.
4,"Very nice gate, foot pedal tough to operate","This is a very nice, sturdy gate -- it obviously will serve its purpose. That said, the foot pedal requires a strong push down and then a coinciding push on the gate with your knee (per the instruction booklet) to be opened. Don't think that this gate will open as easily as a pedal on a garbage can or something like that, which obviously makes it baby proof. Still, if you're choosing between a pedal gate and a more traditional hand-operated gate, just know that the pedal requires a bit of effort."
4,Good Gate,"Good:-Easy to open with one hand.-Works great for keeping the dog out of the nursery.-Really like the pressure mounting, easy to install.Bad:-Gate creeks"
4,"Great gate, but narrow","This is the only gate I've used so far for our 1 year old. It's nice & I have no complaints except that it's very narrow which makes carrying laundry baskets, etc. through it difficult. And make sure to check your door width. It didn't fit ANY doors in our house without the extenders."
2,Daughter opened it at 12 months,"This is a great gate if you have a child that won't try everything she can to open it. My daughter quickly figured out that if she jumped on the foot pedal a few times, it would open it. Now my daughter is very determined and resourceful. Kids that are more content and calm might be fine with it."
5,Amazing gate for little escape artists,"My son is extremely adept at getting past childproofing. He easily figured out how to work our friends' baby gates (and taught all their kids. Whoops!). This gate is the only one that has contained him. He knows how it works, but at 30 lbs he doesn't weigh enough to trigger the pedal. It's very easy for an adult to open, and most kids don't weigh enough to open it."
4,Wonderful...but broke after only 5 months!!,"I bought this gate for my 10 month old and our cats, when they come over. The cats can jump over it but my son stays safe. The gate worked wonderfully. Easy to use, stayed in place. After less than a week of the cats (weighing less than 10 lbs.) jumping over it (they would push off the top of the gate to get over) the plastic hinge broke. We had the gate for 5 months. It only has a 90-day warranty so now it's pretty useless. I would still say this is a great gate, just don't put repetitive pressure on the top because the plastic hinges can't handle much at all."
5,"Convenient, stylish and non-marring","We have two of these gates and love them! Unlike some of the other reviewers, we have never had any problems with the pedals breaking. The gate enables easy access in highly trafficked areas - no need to rest a sleeping baby on your knee because you need your hands! I particularly like that we didn't have to drill holes into our walls or woodwork. One of the gates goes across a hallway with baseboards. We did have to place a piece of wood between the wall and upper gate mount to ensure stability. Otherwise, however, this gate is secure and looks good, too."
2,Don't get this gate if you have kick molding in your home.,"I've been in desperate need of a lot of baby gates to put up in several places in my home now that my 1 yr. old is active and crawling around. So, I purchased the Hands-free gate for our kitchen/dinning room entrance. I was so disappointed when I could not install it due to our kick molding. We have it thru out the house so I couldn't install it in any room.Even though they are a bit of a pain to install, I've found that the Safeway and Configure gates are much, much more reliable and safer."
2,Good idea but did not hold up,"We were excited to find a good gate that we could get shipped to us(military family overseas). Thing is, it broke within the first week! The spring inside busted so it would not stay locked. It worked for a while even with the broken spring. After a while tho, our dog and daughter both figured out how to open it. :P"
5,Awesome gate!!,This is the best gate. We bought a different one and we returned it for this one. Very easy to assemble and easy to use. I highly recommend it
4,nice for the price,"I really like this gate, and it's one of the more affordable gates out there.It was fairly easy to install (no holes in the wall!), and my husband and I feel that it easy to use.Our only complaint is that the opening is a little narrow when you're carrying a baby on your hip!"
5,Hands free gate rocks!,"This gate is great! We currently have two in our home, keeps the dog out of certain rooms. The nifty foot pedal helps us get in and out of the gates without lifting our legs or having to drop what we are holding to open it. After a couple of days, the foot pedal use becomes so automatic that you forget the gate is even there!"
5,Wish We'd Gotten it Sooner,I stalled on buying baby gates because I wasn't sure where I wanted to put them or how many or what kind. After reviewing this gate online we purchased and installed it in the kitchen doorway that leads to the front hall. Like another reviewer's this is a high traffic doorway and we've already put it to a lot of use over one weekend. The narrow-ish opening doesn't seem too restrictive for us and the hands free aspect makes this a real winner. Very easy to use and it relatches itself very easily.
2,"Oh well, it was worth a try",The upper hinge broke. We have it taped right now but sooner or later it will be replaced with something more reliable.It's very narrow and does not provide well for differences in wall width at the top and bottom(baseboard).
2,Will not work if you have moulding,"You need at least 2 inches of flat surface by the floor in order for the bottom pressure pads to work. If you have molding, there might not be enough area for the pads."
2,Bad for stairs especially and perhaps all together,"I seriously dislike this unit for preventing the baby from going up or down a set of stairs. Going down the stairs with a baby in your arms can be dangerous with the center piece having a floor attached ""bump component;"" even despite the curve they have added to not catch your foot (it still does catch at times). It has it's pluses comparing to other units I have seen so far. For one, you do not have to drill the walls to attach it. However, at the top of a stairwell there is no escaping that (having to drill) to have safety, as far as I can see. I am returning this one & going to look for one that attaches to the walls and does not have anything to trip over."
1,My 11-month old can open this gate,"We installed this gate at the top of our stairs yesterday; today, our 11-month old son opened it and fell down the stairs. He's not hurt, thankfully, but clearly the gate isn't very effective. The gate was properly installed and securely closed, but he was able to open it by standing on the foot pedal while holding onto the top of the gate.The gate itself seems well-constructed and is very easy for my husband and I to use; however, because it's also so easy for our baby to use, we'll be replacing it with a different gate tonight.I can't recommend this gate for installation in critical areas of your home."
1,Poor design - 15 month old pulls up foot pedal,"Our 15 month old grandson is able to pull up on the foot pedal and remove it, then push the gate open. The First Years company has indicated we need to replace the foot pedal but is not broken, just easy to pull up and remove. We had no idea it was that easy until he did it. As grandparents who want to keep a toddler out of non-childproof areas, this product did not work for us and we would not recommend it to others."
1,First years - Hands Free Gate,"While it works, it's a pretty good gate. However, the locking mechanism on ours was worn out after 6 months. When calling customer service, they told us to cut the whole lock off of the gate and mail it to them for review before they would do anything. Totally ridiculous. There are better, less complex gates out there. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,Beware of sharp edge,Love the gate BUT poor quality control on the manufacturing - sharp piece of metal stuck out and caused puncture wound on my finger. Make sure you check thoroughly before letting baby near it
3,safety issues,"We replaced all of our gates with this brand(4). Loved the hands free opening. However most people who visit seem to have no idea how to use it. I saw a maintenence man look at for awhile and decided to jump over it. It has a sticker on it that shows a foot pressing a pedal , but it blends into the surface. Unfortunately my 23 month old figured out if he jumped on the pedal it would open for him. very scary for the one that eventually leads to stairs. We had to then get another safety devive used for cabinets to hook on the bottom. So they only last as smart as your child is."
4,okay gate,"I bought this gate yesterday. Unfortunately it did not work in my very unusual doorway. One thing I did notice was that after I put it together, my 2yr old daughter happened to be watching, she immediately knew how to open the gate! Even if it did fit I still would have had to return it since she knew how to open it. Great gate for younger children/pets."
1,Not Pleased,"After reading the reviews, I ordered this gate to keep my small dogs(<8Ib) from coming into my baby's room when we are playing on the floor. But they are able to get through the sides of the gate. Also I thought since it stated its hands free gate, the gate would swing open when you step on the pedal, but it doesn't. You have to push the gate open after you step on the pedal or use your knee to open the gate."
1,Do Not Buy,"My Son is 18 months old. I have had my gate for many years and it has been nothing but trouble. My Son keeps getting stuck in between the bars. He has sprained his knee and almost broke it Four times.Concerned,Customer"
1,"Like the gate, but Amazon gets 1 star","I needed a gate for the top of the stairs, and searched Amazon for ""baby gate top of stairs."" This gate is the second item returned. Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs. Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS. The gate works great in the upstairs hallway, but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room."
1,BAD EXPERIENCE!,"I do NOT recommend this gate. The one I bought was mismanufactured, and I could never get a secure fit. Additionally, I received a HUGE bloodblister while trying to put it together. I certainly expected more from The First Years and from a gate in this price range. I am so disappointed in this product and am returning it shortly."
4,A HUGE improvement over the old baby gates,"These gates are GREAT. They are SO easy to use, you didn't know how much simpler life with baby gates could be. Between kids and dogs, I have these up in almost every doorway in my house. They are a little difficult to get adjusted correctly when you install them, and you might scuff the wall a bit, but once they are in place, I wouldn't trade them for the world!!!!"
5,DOGGY GATE,"I LOVE IT!!!! One of the best investments I've made as this is perfect to have a permanent gate to keep my 4 maltese doggies in one room when I need to go out. I tried 3 other gates for this purpose but my one malt could climb over all of them but with this gate she can't because of the vertical bars, there's no way for her to climb it. Also the pedal opens the gate door very easily, and the door can stay open until I need to close it giving me complete access to the room when the gate is not needed. The gate is sturdy, well made and the complete package. Well worth the money it costs.."
2,Easy to set up but *don't* try to use on banisters...,"DO NOT try to use for stairs with wooden banisters. Super easy assembly but we found that they require such pressure on each side to close gate properly that instead of securing into place, it actually pulled the banister from the wall."
5,Great gate!,"We love this gate, which we've been using for over a year at the top of our stairs. We have uneven walls in this space (smaller space at bottom of gate) due to large base molding, and this gate is a perfect solution. The foot pedal is easy to use, even while carrying a wiggling baby, and the gate is secure. We had to add one extension. I only wish the gate was available in wider widths - it would be great for our front porch."
5,THE BEST GATE EVER!,"This gate is great. I bought 2 for my 2 year old to stay out of rooms that he is not allowed to go in to. Its so easy, I just don't know what I would do with out it. Anybody out there that wants to buy a gate, it is well worth the money to buy this gate. No more climbing over gates or drilling holes in the wall for those other gates that open. They are also the tallest gates, which is good, cause then they will last longer, unlike the others that are so short, they can climb them. They also have up and down bars instead of checkered like the others. (makes it where they can't climb) Your child will have to be at least 4-5 years old before they will be able to push the peadle hard enough to open it. My son could climb any gate I bought till this one. Great gate, 5 stars! Love it!"
5,Well Built and Easy to Use Gate,"This gate is sturdy, well built, and very easy to use. It enables mom to get in and out using her foot. I can carry full laundry baskets through & never have to put them down. You need a firm step to open it, so a child cannot operate it. This gate is WELL worth the price."
4,First Years Gate,This gate had worked really well for us. We especially like the fact that it is spring loaded and doesn't require any hardware to install. The hands free feature is excellent and so much more convenient than those other clumsy gates. I do wish that extenders were sold so that we could use it throughout the rest of the house for our larger openings.
4,"Wonderful item, but be aware","My husband and I registered for this item and think it is the greatest thing. Being able to open and close the gate with no hands is a dreamas we have tried several for use previously with our pets that were just awful. There are only two things I would like to point out that require improvement in order for it to be rated five-star. First, the manufacturer needs to make an adjustment to the pedal where the gate closure pin secures the gate closed. Currently it looks like an upside down ""U"" shape, but the top pin area is totally enlosed. I found this to be very important as I walked through the open gate one morning and the sharp corner on the bottom sliced open my toe. Secondly make sure you measure the area where you plan on locating the gate as it doesn't fit all door spaces. It needs expansion options."
4,"Excellent, easy to install and tighten","A cinch to install with a special wrench the mfgr supplies. Some safety experts say that these pressure-mounted gates are a risk. I am sure that's true at the top of stairs, but for us, using this just between rooms, it can be installed verrrrry tightly without marring the woodwork. The opening seems narrow at 18"", but it's sufficient for everyone we've had over.Sturdy and attractive, this gate means business!"
3,Not a pet proof gate,We purchased this gate to keep our two dogs out of the baby's room. It took them about a week to figure out how to open it. We come home and the removable pedal is pulled off and the gate is wide open. This defeats the purpose. The gate is durable and easy to install but I wish I had purchased the more expensive gate without the foot pedal.
5,Great Gate,This is a great gate. I looked all over for the perfect gate for our front room. We certainly did not want one that required us to install hardware and that would then leave permanent marks on our walls. This gate is sturdy and also looks nicer than the others I ran across. This gate is well worth the cost. Again I love this gate.
5,It may cause a little bit more...but it worth to have one!,"My husband and I just got this Hands-Free Gate for guarding our eight months old baby from crawling into the kitchen. We are very satisfy with it. In fact, my husband would often praise about this product and also the person(s) who designed it. The quality of this product is very durable and it is easy to install. I can go in and out through the gate easy while my hands are full with stuffs. When it calls a ""Hand-Free Gate"", it means it!"
5,BEST GATE EVER,"Easy to install, user friedly, props open while they're asleep, truly hands free. We bought 2!"
3,good for kids under 2 1/2,it's good for little ones who are crawling and just learning to walk. But recently my 2 1/2 year old has learned how to open the gate so we are now going to have to buy a new one. You need to make sure that if you have a larger opening that you buy both extensions as well. I found out that i needed both as before my found out how to open the gate with the foot pedal she learned that if she shook the gate hard enough she could get it to fall over. I would recommend this gate for smaller kids but as soon as your kid get's to 2 1/2 i would get a new gate.
5,Perfect Gate,Bought the gate to keep our dog out of the living room. The hands-free option is the best way to go. The gate works perfect and we are very happy with the purchase.
4,Very Easy to Use,"We have this gate in the entrance to our sons room. It's great for keeping the dog out. And it's very easy to open. I'm sure as he gets older it will be very easy for him to get open too, however for now (he's only 3 months) it's exactly what we wanted to start out with."
5,EXCELLANT GATE,I RECEIVED THIS FOR MY BABY SHOWER AND AM VERY PLEASED! IT IS EASY TO OPEN WHILE CARRYING MY BABY AND KEEPS THE DOG IN THE FAMILY ROOM WHEN WE ARE AWAY. THE DOOR SWINGS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS WHICH IS TERRIFIC IN MY DOORWAY. I PLAN TO BUY MORE FOR THE REST OF THE HOUSE.
3,Not ideal for high traffic areas,I use the hands free gate at home to block off a hallway and it works great because there is a small amount of traffic there. I also use them in our church nursery and have had a terrible time with the grippers falling off and the pedals breaking due to the high amount of traffic going in and out. I would not recommend this gate for commercial daycare or church use. It was not easy to find replacement parts either.
5,"Excellent, Easy Product","We bought this b/c it was one of the least expensive- but you would NOT know it based on ease of use and style. My friend has five in her home, and we are purchasing our second. The extensions are easy to attach. My son is cruising, and he can pull himself up on this gate without a wobble. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,The Best gate ever!!!,We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!
5,Great gate!,"I think this gate works great. I have it installed in the doorway of my daughters room. Because I have two dogs I was worried that the dogs would be in her room when she was sleeping or playing. I love that the gate swings both ways. Sometimes I will have the gate open just enough so it doesn't lock, but on the side where the dogs can't push it open. They would have to somehow pull it towards them to open it and they're not smart enough to do that! This way it's quieter for me to get in and out of her room when she's sleeping. It's wonderful and would recommend it."
4,Wonderful Gate!,This gate is wonderful! We really like the fact that it is pressure mounted not wall mounted - no holes in the wall. We can move it to another doorway. The foot pedal is great as is the wide open swing. Also works great for our dogs. We ended up buying two extensions to fit our doorway. Do not recommend more than 1 or 2 extensions though - it becomes a bit wobbly. A must have item for parents who need a gate.
2,Bent gate,"The baby gate arrived quickly and was well packaged; however, after putting the gate up, I realized that it was slightly bent and doesn't align well with the door frame, making it more difficult to open and close. The pedal does still work. I got this gate for my dogs in order to keep them separate from the cat. Unfortunately, if they jump on the gate hard enough they can push it down. I think I would have been better off getting a gate that needed to be screwed into the wall. The hands free opener is a nice touch and the dogs haven't been able to figure it out."
5,Perfect for kitchen entrance,We use this gate with one extension and it works perfect for keeping my very large 1 yr old (~30 lbs) out of the kitchen while cooking. Very sturdy and nearly impossible for him to open on his own. The pedal is a great design feature and allows us to move easily in and out while carrying things (garbage?). No complaints after 3 months of use.
4,Great product - terrible packaging,After 4 weeks I finally got this baby gate up and it works great! The reason I had to wait 4 weeks is because it arrived UPS in the same box one would buy at the store. It looked like it had been around the world a few times and sure enough when I opened it - parts were missing. I called the manufacturer and they were great and responsive sending me the missing parts accept they sent the wrong ones. 2nd try was a charm and everything is working fine. Comment to Amazon or this shipper - try a better box.
3,The gate itself is good BUT....,"The gate it's not wide enough to fit the top of my stairs and honestly I don't think you can fit this gate anywhere without the gate extention([more] more). I had to go back to the store 3 times, first to get an extention, second to return the gate because it was damaged then the third time the pedal was broken and finally I got a good one. I looks safe though. Maybe will be good. The other costumers seam to like it so I'm gonna keep it and see what happen."
1,Does not fit in a larger doorway and can't find extension,I thought the gate looked great and bought it and brought it home and the first thing I discovered is it only fits in an ordinary doorway - anything a little larger and it needs an extension. The First Years web site said that the gate extension kit was available at Babies R us - it was not and not on their web site either - and I couldn't find it on the web anywhere either using all the different search engines. I guess I'll just return it and start over if a call to the First Years doesn't resolve this.
1,ok for doorway with no door...,"I wanted to put this on a bedroom doorway, and put it up so it was level (took a little while) but the bedroom door would not close because the foot peddle on this gate was too wide. I was easy to open with foot but I neede the door to shut so I returned it."
2,Grandmother disappointed in product,"I looked at a lot of gates and thought this one looked the best. For one thing I only need it at times when my grandchildren visit from out of state which is not as often as we would like since they are all over 2000 miles away. This one was better than the wooden ones which fall down so easily and are a nuisance to open and close. I liked the idea that it could be installed without a lot of hardware and putting holes in my walls. By appearances it looked like it would do the job of keeping my grandchildren in the parts of the house where we wanted them without the adults having to canstantly keep them out of rooms that are off limits. The theory was great--the reality was different. Within the first day of their visit, my 27 month old grandson not only had figured out how the gate opened but he was also able to open it on his own and thus defeated the whole purpose of the gate. I spent a lot of money on something that didn't work."
1,Where's the dimensions?,"Where did you hide the details: Height, width, etc. How can I determine if this will fit? I would have bought it instantly if I knew it would fit or if I could buy extensions to make it fit."
2,This is not well built.,"Getting the gate to open and close is dang near impossible without extremely fine tuning the wall ""brackets."" The idea is there, using a foot pedal to open it, but the follow through and build quality is basically crap. I ended up trimming back the little pins that go into the locking mechanism, to allow for easier opening and closing. Even with the modifications, the foot petal was coming off after maybe 50-100 openings. Also, you have to adjust the tension on the wall brackets about once a week or so, to keep it opening and closing properly and without tons of force.I do not recommend this product."
4,Reliable and Convenient,"Utilized these for our stairs and they work very well. I was surprised how nice they looked once they arrived. Being able to utilize a step to unlatch the gate is very nice to have, seeing as our kid or some other object seems to be in our hands every time we go up and down the stairs.However, we required two extensions on each of the gates we purchased in order to get to the appropriate width for our staircases so I would recommend making sure you measure your stairs before ordering this gate and the necessary extensions."
1,Comes with its own giant trip bar!,"The bar across the bottom is very tall and creates a terrible trip hazard. We boxed this item up and returned it as we imagined ourselves, baby in hand, falling down the stairs after we tripped over this gate. Really silly design."
2,Was flimsy,I have several baby gates so it's not that I didn't install it right. Its just that my daughter could rip this one right out. The others that I had held up when she would do her monkey in a cage routine but this one would rip out. It holds on for a while but still she can tear it down. So I wouldn't recommend it.
4,"Great gate, but not for stairs!","This is a great gate. It's easy to install (according to my husband), is very convenient with the foot pedal release and you can just slam the door shut, and the pressure mounts are very sturdy. My only complaint is that nowhere in the box or on the directions does it say you can NOT use it on stairs. The only place it says, ""not for stairs,"" is on the small warning label on the gate itself. It does seem sturdy enough for a crawler on the stairs, but we're not taking the chance, so now we have to buy another gate. We're first time parents, so we didn't realize that you should use any type of pressure-mount gate (even if it's the screw kind like this one)."
5,GOOD PRODUCT,IT WAS REALLY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. VERY DURABLE AND THANKFULLY MY ONE YEAR OLD HASN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO OPEN IT. IT WOULD TAKE ALOT OF EFFORT FOR HIM TO DO THAT. IT DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSE TO DO. I WOULD RECOMMENDED IT TO ANYONE WHO HAS A CURIOUS TODDLER.
2,Sent back...,"The gate did not fit into the entrance of our staircase and although the website of the manufacturer claims that there are extensions, none could be found on the site.Even though I could not complete the installation, the product itself did not inspire much confidence that it was going to withstand what we demanded of it, namely keeping our toddler daughter from falling down the stairs.In addition, the pieces used to put together the gate were of poor quality and tolerance. One only wishes that the manufacturers of such products understood that when dealing with safety, short-cuts in quality should never be tolerated."
4,good one,"easy to install and so easy to use, it's just a great product. I love it. It delivers what it promises"
5,Great Gate,"I have seen and used many gates, and I can tell you this is the best gate out there. It is very sturdy and most important the child can not defeat the mechanism. My kid could unlock many of the gates out there after repeated attempts. Plus it is very sturdy and can take a kid pulling at it with full force.It is also easy for adults to to open. If it fits your door, get it!"
3,"""You will receive either an arched or flat topped gate""","Note that line in the Amazon product description. I didn't pay much attention to it until I received my order today and noticed that the arched gate DOES NOT come with the ""ramp"" on the bottom bar. Instead, it's just a square bar like all the other gates out there. I had specifically ordered this one so that I could get the ramp to avoid catching any baby toes/feet when stepping over the bar. I should've simply ordered another Dreambaby gate to go with the other one I already have. At least I would have had interchangeable parts among the gates, but now I'm stuck with two different gates that technically ""work"" but didn't meet my expectations."
2,Worked for a while,"The idea of a hands-free gate is great; however, the plastic foot pedal on this gate broke in the first few weeks after installation. We fixed the pedal with duct tape and were able to use the gate for a couple months thereafter. Now, one of the two plastic tabs that secure/lock the gate closed is jammed inside of the gate and the remaining tab is too flimsy to hold. I will return it for a different one as soon as possible!!"
4,Great gate,I saw some not so good reviews on this product so I was not sure about it- When my husband put it together (which was easy to do) I was and am very happy with the gate. The foot peddle is great when you are holding a sleeping baby (or one that is awake) you don't have to move your arms which might wake her up.
2,Not high enough,This seems to be well made but I have a 4 month old toy poodle. Weighs 3.2 pounds. She gets over this. Not good for any dog since they don't come too much smaller than mine
3,Shopping for another gate now,"I purchased this gate about 8 months ago, it has done a good job until now. I have an 8mo old child and 2 dogs. I keep this gate between the kitchen and the living room. I keep the dogs in the kitchen behind the gate at night and when I am not home. Now, the top hinge of the gate just busted on me. Funny that the entire thing is made of metal except for the hinges and latches, what gives? So I guess this gate is not for you if you keep it in a heavy traffic area. And by heavy traffic, I mean you open and close it about 5~7 times a day."
1,Deceptive Picture,"Afther searching everywhere for Arm & Hammer 36 hour w/baking soda, it was recommeded to me to go to Amazon. Wow, I was ecstatic when I found the product for my husband because he swears by it. The picture of the product shown states 36 hours on the label and shows w/baking soda. It wasn't until the next day when I looked at my confirmation and discovered the product description stated only 24 hours protection and no baking soda. I can buy that at my local store w/o shipping if I wanted that."
4,"A concise, comprehensive review of Argentina","I found the book relatively easy to follow and well thought out. There is a good discussion of economic, political, and social problems and developments, helping the reader to fully understand the events of the day, providing an excellent introduction to Argentina's history."
2,Not comfortable using it,"Please see my review of the ThermaCELL MR-1C on why I decided not to use this product after I did some research on the synthetic chemical they use.....and, why I now use simple household, white distilled vinegar instead! Works 100% effective so far!"
1,By Far the Worst,"This game is by far the worst video game ever produced - and it's had some tough competition for that non-honor. However, my opinion is shared by literally dozens of wakeboarding/video game afficianados whose negative reviews of this product have spread like a plague of bad press across internet wakeboarding forums. There is a reason why this game sells for 2.99-4.99 on eBay. Ask yourself why, then look into buying a real game. We can only be glad that a next geneartion of wakeboarding games is coming between now and 2003. Thanks, and have a good day."
1,Bad,"Don't buy this game the graphics are pathetic and u only get one rider to choose from it is really slow even when i have a fast computor, I recomend u don't buy this game it is a waste of valuable money!"
1,Zoom pictures not good.,"I took this camera to the Smokey mountains and all my full zoom pictures were gray. I thought the store messed up on developing the pictures but it was the camera, each picture was taken during a sunny day, so lighting couldn't of been an issue. Needless to say I returned the camera."
2,Blurry pictures,"This is not the first autofocus camera we have ever had, but it is the first to produce so many blurry photos. Apparently by design this camera is not focused until the green light stops blinking; this doesn't sound like a major problem except that THE GREEN LIGHT IS ALMOST ALWAYS BLINKING! What is that? When it does actually stop blinking, well, then, you get a really nice photo. But try it yourself - it's difficult to get the stupid light to stop blinking. According to the manual - the cause of blinking is 'camera unable to focus'; suggested remedy - focus on something else. That's great..."
2,Loud and Slow,"Man, I can't believe how slow this camera is to take the next shot! It takes almost 6 seconds 'til I can take another picture. And the zooming is so loud. And it's not a pretty sound either!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"This camera has been a nightmare from day one. I'm pretty sure I received a lemon, but in two attempts to repair it, the manufactuer has been unsuccessful. I feel the camera should have been replaced, but my warranty is now up and I am stuck with a camera that does not take sharp photos - often without focusing on anything in the picture. The sports setting is also useless, as any shot with slight movement comes out very blurry. I, personally, would not recommend this camera."
4,EQUATES TO CLASSIC HUMOR,"You really have to go back a few years to get Humor that's clean enough to share...This is the ""mad mad mad mad world of cars"" gumball rally."
4,Gumball!! Gumball!!,"Forget the silly Cannonball Run movies! The Gumball Rally has better cars, (Cobra)!! AND Better actors, Raul Julia! A must for car lovers and race lovers everywhere!"
4,The Gumball Rally,"One of the best car chase, action packed, and funny movies there is. Look for Raul Julia as an Italian race car driver who loves fast cars and fast women. Some of the cars in this movie go faster than a helicopter can go. Also watch for the NY cop who is always one step behind the racers. Watch the women driving the Porsche, the guy on the motorcycle, and the police car in the race from NY to Long Beach with all of the decals from each state. This movie is a super ride!"
5,When is this coming out on DVD,The best road race movie ever. Much better than The Cannonball Run. When is this coming out on DVD. It's a classic.
5,REAL STARS WITH FAST CARS,THIS IS THE BEST REAL CAR CHASE MOVIE EVER. IT HAS REAL CARS AT REAL SPEED NOT JUST SPED-UP FILMING. PLUS A REAL 427 COBRA VS. A FERRARI DAYTONA CONVERTABLE...GREAT STUFF ! SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE A REMAKE OF THIS ONE.
3,Car madness,"The Gumball Rally is just a fun movie (in the same vein as The Canonball rally)for people that like classic cars. There is no plot, there are no special effects and in general one can see that this was a low budget production.However there are some great car racing scenes with cars that one doesn't see very often. My favourite being the AC Cobra."
3,The Gumball Rally / Cannonball Run II,The Gumball Rally is an enjoyable funny movie.If you own The Cannonball Run then Cannonball II is worth adding to your collection.
5,2 classic racing comedies on one shiny DVD!!! Wow!!!,"Wow!!! What a great DVD,it contains BOTH ""The Gumball Rally"" and ""The Cannonball Run II"" on one double sided DVD!!! This gives you more bang for your buck,it's cheaper than buying the two DVD's individually!!! And it's saves space too!!! ""Gumball Rally"" is in Widescreen and ""Cannonball II"" is Standard Full Frame,but thats okay because these great movies are finally available on DVD!!! These great racing comedies are full of laughs and features a ton of great acting talent that includes:Burt Reynolds,Sammy Davis Jr.,Michael Sazarrin,Jackie Chan,Telly Savalas,Frank Sinatra,Raul Julia,Dom Deluise,Jamie Farr,Catherine Bach,Richard Kiel,Dean Martin,Doug McClure,Charles Nelson Reilly,Shirley MaClaine,Jack Elam,Don Knotts,Ricardo Montalban,Tony Danza,Mel Tillis,and many more!!! Absolute classic car racing comedies!!! Move over Talledega Nights,these are the original classics!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
3,Dated but funny,"Kind of slow moving compared to current movies, the Gumball Rally still has much to recommend it and is far superior to its '70s competition (like the Cannonball Run). Good fun for inoffensive family fare"
5,Gumball Rally,"This is a great movie. The driving scenes are exceptional, especially the camaro through the arkansas hills. The cast is believable and Raul Julia is fanatastic as Franco. This movie is terrific and should be in every car guy's library."
3,Gumball Rally,"Yes,this an old movie,and after not seeing it 30 odd years I found it tobe a fun show,one that the family enjoyed as well.There is no bad language the race is good.Deano and Sammy Davis took their parts as did the rest of the cast,enjoy!Jacko"
1,"Once again, Amazon's item description is INACCURATE!","The item description for this DVD says WIDESCREEN. But only ""The Gumball Rally"" is in WS. ""Cannonball Run II"" is presented in full screen. BUMMER. Why do they even bother?Buyer beware!"
5,Lovin it!!,"What a movie! Great concept, funny, and a star is born with the Ferrari Daytona, the beautiful music the V12 makes. Great shots going 130mph+ in multiple scenes. I can watch those scenes of the Ferrari over and over again and never get tired of them. If you love Ferrari V12's, you have to get this!"
5,Great classic car racing flick,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a great blast from the past.This film has held up well over the years. Great, interesting and funny story, plenty ofaction with the classic cars and all the actors are very good. This was well worth theVOD rental price. I would like to note that Linda Vaughn is featured at the end of themovie. If you were into cars and racing in the seventies and eighties than you know whoLinda Vaughn is. She is very hard to forgoet."
4,A Good Starter,"This book will give you a good idea on basic Buddhism. Some of the pictures are cheesy but if you can overlook that, it is well written. I would not recommend this for someone who has been Buddhist for many years, but it is a good introduction for beginners and people seeking to gain a better idea what Buddhism is about."
5,Great,"This is one of the most practical, intelligent, straight-forward and well written books I've ever read about any religion or philosophy.It is like a having a chest of treasure in your hands. The author delves in the the essence of the Buddhist belief system, explaining very plainly the belief system in simple understandable terms. The book not only provides all the essential knowledge for understanding Buddhism, it also provides fantastic exercises, mental, emotional and physical; to bring this belief system into your consciousness.As an added bonus the author also provides a historical background for the development of Buddhism as it adapted into each new culture it touched.If you would like to begin to understand Buddhism, this is a magnificent text with which to start learning. I have provided this book to individuals as young as 12 and they have been able to quickly and easily understand the knowledge imparted.It is my opinion that this is one of the greatest books I've ever encountered."
2,Common sense,"The book provides the common sense of thinking. The logical thinking chapter is very good. The exampes of using Venn digram to explain syllogisms are very clear. It talks about creative thinking, logical thinking, scientific thinking, and persuasive thinking. It never discusses critical thinking. Most textbooks discussed critical thinking as the major theme. It is not clear why this textbook never mentioned it."
4,A good introduction to the Virtual world,"This book goals hits basic idea: giving a review on Virtual Reality and on the theory at its basis. Starting from history, going trought science as medicine, arriving at technical stuff this is in syntesis this book. For everyone interested in ""How it work?"". Only one problem : sometimes is too difficoult to understand at no graduate persons dues to hi level techincal explanations in particoular in display chapter !!!!"
5,The most organized bond film until Brosnan,"Goldfinger is a film that will always portrait Bond in the best light possible. After seeing Thunderball, Dr. No, and You Only live Twice, it became very clear to me that Goldfinger is very well put together. The plot flows very nicely unlike most of the early bond films and therefore makes understanding it a whole lot easier. The picture quality (DVD) is AMAZING!!! I couldnt believe how clear it was and how real life the color was. Sound is superb as well. Must see for all Bond Fanatics!Overall, Goldfinger is my third favorite bond."
4,deleted scenes?,"Hi, does this movie contain deleted scenes? Also is this movie different from the one included in the gift packs Vol 1, Vol 2 etc.I'd like to know before purchasing a stand along movie versus a gift pack.Thanks"
4,"""Good, but not the best""","This film is probably the most famous and popular of all bond films. No doubt a good movie, but not nearly as good as Thunderball. Goldfinger is a little overated. Pussy Galore is awsome, one of the best bond girls. We will never forget odd-job either. The story is o.k. but has a hard time keeping my attention towards the end of the film. This film also lacks some of the humor compared to other bond films. Still an enjoyable bond film, but not the best."
2,A true 60's artifact,"How quaint! The DVD version is just like owning a vintage 35mm print of your own...it's mono, full of specks and scratches... A great movie, but steer clear of this horrid DVD transfer. MGM should be ashamed."
5,Smooth and Sexy,"The third installment of Bond was again quite close to the book, and more of a pure spy story than the action flicks the series later became. Made in the 'good old days', when they could film a Bond movie each year and have a hit every time! It is also the container for the most provocatively named of all 'Bond girls', Pussy Galore. Fleming dreamed up a few of these not so sly double entendres, but this one was REALLY out there. LOL This movie was the first Bond film to change locales around the world several times, moving from Miami to England to Europe and then to Kentucky.The manner of death of some of the villains is a bit altered from the book, but for a film adaptation of a novel Goldfinger stays very true to the original story.Sadly, the battle between Goldfinger's forces and the troops stationed at Fort Knox presage a sad development in Bond climaxes as the series progressed.Very enjoyable, Bond is still more of a spy than a commando, sit back and appreciate it."
2,not worth it,okay so my cousin and I watched this movie and I was amazed at how stupid it was there are one or two good parts but really nothing else the good scenes are the one at the end at fort knox and the begining where he blows up the building althouth it did get a high rating by critics.
5,one of the top 2 james bond movies of all time,"More than likely you've seen this movie but if not here's a brief take. James Bond secret agent for the british empire is on assignment investigating goldfinger. He is and international ""businessman"" who simply loves gold. He has stock piled millions of dollars of gold in various countries around the world. He plans to well, without spoiling to much, he plans on attacking fort knox (where the usa supply of gold is kept) to throw off the world enonomy and become even richer and more powerful. Generally acknowledged as one of the best bond movies of all time, you won't be dissapointed! As a side note my pick for best bond movie #2, casino royale."
5,Excellent movie,I have been a Bond fan since I was young. I recently got a blu-ray player for the holidays and was looking to upgrade my movie collection. This was an excellent edition. I love the remastery of this film.
2,Disappointing - Advertised features not on disk,"Several key elements advertised and even listed on the DVD box itself are NOT on the disk, including The Image Database, The Theatrical Trailer and most importantly The Making of Goldfinger Featurette."
5,Do you expect me to talk about Goldfinger?,"This film is probably the best one, it ties with Roger Moore's Live and Let Die. The evil villain, Auric Goldfinger, is going to raid Fort Knox by spraying poisonous gas. He is going to use a bomb to make the gold there radioactive, it will destroy the economy! Connery, the most suave Bond ever, is sent to investigate and ends up getting captured. Along the way he meets Pussy Galore, and thanks to her, everyone knew what was coming! Oddjob is the second best henchman ever, behind Jaws. A must watch!!!!"
2,"Great movie at the time, but not for modern viewers","I understand this was an awesome movie at the time. New ideas, cutting edge technologies, and great actions created the future of the movie when it was released. Sadly, the time went by so fast, and this movie could not survive the future itself generated. Now, all the attractiveness washed out, Goldfinger only looks a ridiculous and dull movie to me. I would put 5 stars for the historical importance, but can give only two for what I have enjoyed."
3,"Not the best,but still...............","If you are a serious Bond-fan,you simly have to think that this is the best Bond-film.It has nearly been suffocated by it`s own myth.I like it,and think it`s quite good(I love Harold Sakata!)but definetly not the best Bond-film."
2,An epic,"Goldfinger is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Filled with exiting action and beautiful women, It's a must have for any James Bond fan."
1,garbage source material,"Looked forward to this just to see the transfer is full of dust, scratches, and snow. Looks like a cheap tape transfer. Can't believe MGM would besmirch their name with this junk."
5,Second Best,"This one rocks because it basically became the standard of every following Bond movie. It has the gadgets! It has the cool second villain (OddJob), great actor as the key villain (Gert Frobe) and an out of this world scheme, where arch villain Goldfinger will raise the value of his gold by blowing up Fort Knox. Exciting and terrific!"
5,Sean Connery is back as 007!,This is got to be Sean Connery's best Bond performance ever. Connery returns to deliver another great punch into history as James Bond. 007 is in for a real treat when he discovers that it is Goldfinger who he is up against with a vile henchman that uses his hat a weapon. He jumps right into action from the beginning and doesn't let up for a heart-beat. You don't want to miss this Bond classic and better get it while it is still available.
4,Wow factor scale 1-10,Wow factor 1-10 #8Can't compare this disc toDr No # 10 orFrom Russia with love # 10But still the best i've ever seen this Bold look .This is my favorite of all Bonds so I've seen it many times.
4,Classic Bond with a Great Video Transfer,"This is the version to get -- it doesn't contain the extras that the multi-movie box set includes, but I found those extras rather cheesy for Goldfinger, so don't fret about it.The video starts off rather grainy in the first night scene, but seconds after that, the 1.66:1 picture is a revelation in restored video, with crisp, vibrant colors and high-quality resolution (for standard DVD)."
3,Not Connery's Best Bond,"This is probably the most well-known Bond film by Sean Connery. There were many iconic set pieces and moments with memorable and quirky names. Alas, viewing today, all fond memories go up in smoke. It is sadly very outdated and cartoonish. Connery remains Connery, always good. Gert Borbes now becomes a tame villian. All the gadgets now seem cardboardish. Same for the action sequences with the depictions of villians army bothering racist. Quality and sound of blu ray are average."
5,"Classic Bond Film, Amazing Video Quality","Goldfinger is arguably THE classic Bond film and needs no introduction. This high definition blu-ray transfer is just amazing and exceeded my expectations: razor sharp, great color, and far superior to the dvd (which I already own). Tons of extras too, most of which were on the previous DVD release. Get it."
4,Good But Not Great Version,"This is an all-time great movie achievement. The film, made against considerable constraints of budget, accomplishes a sustained mood which is hard to match.My concern is this DVD production. The film itself has not been fully restored; you see scratches and ""blips"" which are no longer acceptable in our era of restoration techniques.And also the commentaries are not as good as we've come to expect. While they are fairly informative, they suffer from a degree of hyperbole which detracts from their credibility. Yes, it is a great movie, all right, but some comments assert that ""in all cinema history..."" which sounds more like hype.Which this movie does not need. To say it's the ""best of all the Bonds"" would not be hype in my view - just something like the truth. You gotta have it..."
3,Great picture but lousy sound!,"Hey I'm a big bond (SC) fan like the next guy, so I really was looking for the ultimate remaster in this disc. Picture is a 9 out of 10 on my calibrated samsung 7series lcd hooked up w/samsung BR player with hdmi. The sound however was like 40% of what my cable hd programming puts out on other bond movies that i recorded! i.e., i can have my vol at a 15 and be pretty satisfied while not bugging the neighbors but this disc at over 25 or so and still not feeling it. That was a big letdowm since my 7.1 sony receiver couldn't save the sound from this disc. HD-sound..meh! it did'nt perform and my equipment is not to blame! So know that going in!"
5,Great movie!,One of my all time favorites. I haven't seen it in many years. It was nice to re-live fond old memories
3,"Classic, but campy","Classic Bond, but obviously dated. Nostalgic, but the action, the fight scenes, etc. are campy at best. Fun, but not nearly as good as remembered."
1,poor toy,now when this order showed up it didnt show up in its original box but in a plastic bag with a bunch of pieces-the toy itself is pretty durable but the pieces that snap on are not-this toy really shows its age-articulation is poor and the snap on pieces are cheezily made and seem a bit generic.
2,"Dull, of interest only for its historical background","If this wasn't put out by the Nazi regime, it is doubtful that Kino would have released it as this is a dull, wooden Titanic. The miniature sets are obvious (the shots are held so long that you can see the obviously poor realism of the miniatures), the romantic subplots tedious, the final """"chaos"" uninvolving. A grade B film that will only interest German film nuts."
5,Extremely interesting,"(review contains spoilers) This movie is labeled as 'anti-British German propaganda'. Nonetheless I found it extremely interesting for the thought-provoking suggestions of Ismay's stock market White Star share speculation (Ismay who would have pressed for maximum speed in an ice-field) during the cross-Atlantic first trip... Could truth be well...somewhere between the official British investigation version and the German 1943 propaganda allegations? Captain Smith 'large' role in this movie seems to be one of a cerf indeed...The 'added' German officer, overly disciplined, seems over doing it a bit too but afterall the boat did sink ...proving in one way his moralizing attitude right. Very interesting if you are open-minded."
5,"Good movie, good extras, good DVD...","Besides a good film full of romance, scams, hate, wealth and power, we also get some great extras in the form of excerpts from the press book, promotional films from the White Star Line and the original 1912 Newsreel. I found the tour of the Olympic the most interesting and almost feel that was worth getting the DVD all together. Of course the film was meant to be propaganda, but gets most of the facts right and tells a good tale - if you overlook the first director being arrested by the Gestapo. Too bad all that time and funding went into it - it was banned in 1943. Yet the unmistakable anti-British and anti-capitalism theme it did well in the Soviet zone when released in Germany in 1949. A must for anybody into the Titanic, into German film or into World War Two."
4,Ann Arbor Observer review says,"...one of the most serious and morally ambitious contemporary novels that I've read in quite a while."" Keith Taylor"
5,Get this without a doubt!!,It is so rare to find an author whose work is aimed at the rank and file of the finance world. Choudhry has excelled himself once again and clearly knows his work. His writing style is quite the most concise yet detailed and also quite convivial. i am quite sure he is an extremely successful person both personally and professionally.
1,Mediocre,"There have been so many good books written about the yield curve that it is hard to imagine why this one was written. It is actually very similar, if not remarkably the same, to a couple of other books previously published. If you have the better written books on this subject, there is no need to buy this. If you don't have them, buy them instead."
5,The Great Escape,"Neil and Emily are racing home when somthing runs in the street. They slam on their brakes, and so did a coming car but the driver still aceidently hit the dog. The car was then hit witch made things worse. As it turned out, a dog was the darting creature. They brought it to the abandond section of King Street Kennels. Neil thinks the dog is the one that had gotten loose about a hundred miles. They knew the dog had puppies for she still had milk. Neil and Emily find the picture of the dog in the paper and know it's the right dog. But where are the puppies? Are they still alive? If they are alive can neil and emily save the lives of these puppies???"
1,I feel conned,"Now that I am 4,000 pages into this series, I feel like the author is failing on his side of the bargain.This book avoided most of the big, really pressing questions left as cliffhangers in Book 3.We also spend a ton of time on new characters that the fist half of the book I didn't care about and the second half dropping more last page cliffhangers on us.So the whole set of characters are now in their own cliffhangers. Which on its own is kind of brutal, very little interim resolution, but I could live with it if the author showed some motivation to move it forward.HBO series or no, I am done with this series. He lost me. I wish I had picked a different series to read."
2,Disappointing and well ... Boring,"He wouldn't have had to split the book in 2 volumes if he'd just edited out oh... about 2/3 of the book. So much backstory, so much history of characters we'd never heard of before and don't care about..."
2,Mediocre at best,"This book was the worst in his series so far.Loved the first three books he wrote, although it was already obvious that he was in trouble. He just lost control! GRRM has a good imagination, but lacks an ""inner editor"".He keeps inventing new subplots and characters, spreading your attention so thin that you essentially stop caring about the story. The story arc is broken.The most laughable thing about GRRM introducing new characters (even minor ones) is when he crams whole background stories in blocks of a few sentences... while quite a few of these minor characters could be omitted altogether. He seems in love with his own imagination, unable to let go. I don't think it's greed... it's incompetence.Oh... and GRRM's recommendation on Robin Hobb's ""Assassin's Quest"" books: ""A diamond in a sea of zircons"" is spot-on... his own writing is definitely one of the zircons. Read Robin Hobb instead."
3,Kind of Disappointing,"After waiting for delays upon delays, I was really excited when this book was finally released and was able to finally purchase this book. The first few chapters were pretty good, but you'll notice pretty quickly that most of the chapters are about the same characters. That of Cercei, Jamie, Brienn, and the Ironmen. There were a handful of chapters about Sansa and Arya also, but not enough of Arya. All of the characters I found interesting were omitted. Like other reviewers, I also found it a chore to finish this book. I absolutely loved the previous three. I hadn't known that this was only going to be half of a book, but upon further reflection I've realized that this really is only a ""half"" book. It's only half interesting and about half filler. Don't feel guilty about skimming the pages."
2,Excellent writing around mediocre material,"While the skill displayed in Mr Martin's narrative hasn't diminished, it is the case in all novels that some characters are more interesting than others. A Feast For Crows seems fixed the less interesting of the characters we've seen. While there are high points through the story, it seems overall lackluster beside the other entries in A Song of Fire and Ice, but if you're invested in the series, I doubt that there's any way you could gloss over this title.If you're not yet invested in the series, a really good set of Cliff's Notes might be an option in the future."
3,Another good installment.,I am halfway through and enjoying it as much as the first 3. Many new characters with their own stories while Westeros continues to battle it out.
2,A Disappointing Effort,"After criticizing the latest Tad Williams novel, ""Shadowmarch"", as being a pale George R. R. Martin imitation, I am now forced to classify ""A Feast For Crows"" as...a pale George R. R. Martin imitation.That same lethargic pacing, that same ambivalent suspense level, that same eye-tiring, can-I-put-this-down-now, how-many-pages-do-I-have-left feeling while reading it.Recipe for this book: take the last few books of ""A Song Of Ice And Fire"", remove the most interesting characters, and in their place add reams of geneology (of minor persons), pages and pages of useless exposition, and endless paragraphs advancing obscure sub-plots.Hopefully, fan reaction (and the lagging sales figures) will convince Martin to fix the problems. If not, let's hope his editor does, or this once-great series will fail to live up to the promise of its outstanding first three volumes."
2,GRRM has lost a reader,"After reading other reviews I am confused as to why many gave 5 out of 5 stars, then go on to voice complaints and list several limitations of the novel. If you didn't like sections of the novel, why give it 5 stars!Perhaps my expectations were too high, like many I waited eagerly, checking GRRM's website at least a few times a month, until Nov 8th and the release of Feast. The misgivings of the novel I found summed up quite nicely by Ross Blackman's review, so I will not repeat them.Can the series be salvaged by upcoming books in the series? I could not care less. I don't care when Dragons is released, I'm not going to hold my breath nor pay $28.00 for it. Maybe in 10 years I will see it in a bargain book bin at a used bookstore and pick it up, because somewhere in the back of my mind the title and author sound vaguely familiar."
4,Person below me nailed it,"That's about all I have to say. Martin writes fantastically, this one just fell a little short compared to the prior three. In comparison to most of the tripe out there today though? You'll eat up the Feast quickly."
1,No more,"Let me start by saying I have not read this book, and I will not read it. I have read the previous three books and I refuse to keep spending money, time and patience on authors that seem to value money and ego more than providing their readers with good books. Milking the cow for all it is worth and writing sagas ad infinitum is for me, just too much. Mr. Martin can count me out."
1,Feast for lazy plotting,I can only imagine how disappointing this book must have been for the people waiting since 2000 for it. No plot line of any interest is advanced in this book. The fact it took seven extra years for DwD puts a lie to Martin's explaination about having too much to write. Clearly he has lost interest in his creation.
3,Is he just trying to drag this out?,"One reviewer does a great job of breaking down the percentages that characters are in the book. Two of my favorites: Jon and Tyrion aren't even in it! Arya and Dany are barely there as well. There are too many slow, unnecessary side stories that seem to go nowhere in really advancing the overall story. Jamie's story is good in this book, but like I said, there are a lot of fillers. I hope the next one gets back on track because I LOVED the first two and really liked the third as well."
2,It doesn't feel like I've only read half a book,"So after killing off half the characters, Martin decides that really the best way to divvy up his monster series is to provide us with a story with only the remaining characters we don't like?Ok don't get me wrong, Jaime has alot of development, Cersei is certainly interesting reading and Brienne is A-OK.But quite frankly I suspect Martin realised that fourth books in epic fantasy series are always terribly bland and because he is a compelling accomplished author, he needed to do something drastic to not buck the trend.The most frustrating thing is that his lack of attention to the more interesting characters in the series is explained at the end, not sure whether its an apology or a stout F U"
3,Disappointing,"After the past three books I was extremely interested in reading the fourth in the series. I am half way through and extremely disappointed. Martin introduces many new characters, the plot is confusing, there is nearly no movement, and it is very slow. I hate to say it but this book was a disappointment."
2,"Boring, verbose and difficult to follow","My title says it all. With 1000+ reviews I won't say anything that hasn't already been said in much greater detail. I simply want to add my vote for the record and to balance out the astounding 5 star reviews (those have to be from friends,relatives and publishers). This fourth book is a major disappointment if you were expecting a continuation of the plot lines from the first three books. Instead, it lays the groundwork for new characters in what appears to be a never-ending series and speads waaaay too much time on Cersei."
1,A Feast of Crows,"The first three books in this series really drew you into the characters. You had your favorites and you rooted for them. Then in the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, most of them disappear and there is no closing. Arya's ending in this book is ridiculous. It's like the author wanted to get rid of 80% of our favorites and bring in characters that we have no interest in and I have to admit I lost track of the outrageous plots. It was very hard to get through this book and I truly have no desire to go on to read the 5th one."
1,Boring,"Well that was a huge waste of my time. The other books were very interesting and the story moved along and was engaging to read. This book was boring, long winded chapters that any decent editor would have cut and burned. Nothing about our favorite characters and too much about minor characters of no interest to the story. Aryra and Bram are wasted chatacters with potential lost. Sansa becomes insipid and shallow."
3,Wanted: Editor for Fantasy Author,"George R.R. Martin needs an editor. The successful applicant will possess the ability to pare meandering, bloated prose without sentiment and without regard to the writer's fame and/or publishing clout. The successful applicant will possess the ability to refine a dull 800-page manuscript into an outstanding 400-page published book, thereby financially benefiting Mr. Martin by producing an accessible and engrossing work. (Position also available for Tom Clancy.)Seriously, I loved the first three books and I eagerly awaited this one. Sadly, all of the stylistic excesses of the previous books are present in this book with little of the emotional interest that made those excesses previously forgivable. Each of these books cries out to be slashed in half; they could have been so transcendent ..."
1,Overkill and boring,Wow was this a let down. A bunch of Story lines with dead ends. Names and places that mean nothing and have no relevance. Martin killed everyone off in the last book and struggles to make the story continue with any depth. He covers it with so many names and places it doesn't make any sense and kills trees.
2,When will it all end?,"I just have to get this off my chest: this book is tedious. Yes, I'm among the legions who read the first three Fire and Ice books and kept checking Martin's website for news of the fourth. Like many, I preordered. Before I had a chance to start reading, I saw the bad reviews start pouring out, so I delayed reading A Feast for Crows, fearing Robert Jordan syndrome. When I finally started reading, my worst fears were realized, and I've felt pure disappointment. As many others have said here, too many characters, too little plot advancement.Every night I read one chapter, hoping that something will happen. Every night I count the pages till the end, and it seems interminable. You can see Martin's world expanding but with no purpose. Martin seems to be writing for himself, fogetting his readers. All that talent wasted on noodling his navel. Time to find the next series."
2,Quite a Disappointment,"I hate to say it - since I loved the first three books - but it really isn't worth the trouble... To me, it read like a history textbook. There were more pages dedicated to the names, lineages, and the shield crests of characters that are ancillary to the tale than actual ""goings on"" or action in the story. Quite a disappointment, especially after a delay of well over a year in the publishing of the book.Frankly, I was waiting for Nynaeve to start the braid pulling..."
1,Where's my book?,I can't give a review... see... I preordered this book OVER TWO YEARS AGO and still Amazon hasn't shipped it.Going by the reviews given... Has Martin pulled a Robert Jordan?
3,The new Robert Jordan?,"All of the criticisms written previously are in my opinion accurate but I wanted to add another worry...I think that fond readers of this series my be in for another Wheel of Time fiasco, and God I hope that I am wrong. As most fantasy readers know, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time ""Trilogy"" (laugh) has gone well beyond the point of being remotely interesting and into the boringly laughable. I can only hope that Martin learns a lesson from that now-weak series and starts to throw a bit more action into the mix. Please do not get me wrong, I absolutely love this series and can't wait for the next half of this book (which I assume will actually be available in the next decade some time)...but I said that about the Wheel of Time around book 4 as well."
5,Addictive like crack,"The series is divided laregly into two parts The North or Ice, and The South or Fire. In the previous books Martin had written fairly equally about both sides, however A Feast for Crows, focuses more on the South as the plot thickens. Still the book remains as captivating as the other three, and leaves you thirsting for more, can't wait for A dnace with Dragons."
4,quite good,"I think Martin is a great fantasy writer, this is a quite good books, and not only good, because we were waiting for years this book and so we were full of expectation, that's all!bye"
5,Feast of Crows,Excellent 3rd book in the series. George Martin has a way of keeping the reader off balance. Just when you think the story is going to go in on direction he shifts and goes another way. The result is a facinating read.
2,Taking a page from Jordan?,I have been a big fan of Martins but I fear after reading FOC he may be going down the road of Robert Jordan(hook you and string you along for the next ten years) I rushed out and bought the book immediatley but with the next book I will patiently wait for the library to have it available so I do not waste my money on a monotony of story lines. Mr. Martin can we expect another eight books in this series?
1,A Passing Wind,"A lot of build up and fluff. You can speak that this is only 1/2 the book that Martin wanted to publish but with such a time gap between books and no substantial story line, all the characters and individual story lines are vanishing from my memory. To me, this book was a waste of both my money and time. I wish I could have skipped this book and since I probably will not lose any important story line information since I am starting to forget it anyway. I will state that the first three books were amazing and I am hoping the next book redeems my faith for what Martin has done in his first three books. My recommendation, skip this book"
5,Best Book Ever,Very much good book for to be reading. It made the heart sing with joyness. Nothing could be making me a happy purchase guy more than this novel of the dragons.
2,A Hundred Rabbit Trails,"This book is the first in the series in which I feel like there is no coherent plot or story line. I'm not sure who are the protagonists or the antagonists. I've almost forgotten why I enjoyed the story line in the previous books so much in the first place. I found myself at the end of this book not just skimming paragraphs but skipping them entirely because of the tedium. After reading this we are now faced with choices. Do we continue to drudge on hoping that the story can be revitalized to its previous greatness? Or do we decide this is a waste of our time as there are a lot of good stories out there to read and we only have a finite time on this earth to read them? As for my part, I have invested to much time already to just give up. If A Dance With Dragons is not a vast improvement then I'll be leaving this series unfinished."
3,Pay the bills,"At the bigning the Song of Ice and Fire was a master piece. A true epic saga that kept the readers attention from the first words till the end! Clever and full of good stories and charming caracters. Unfortunately the Feast for Crows didn't stand up to my expectations. It's just another endless-epic-S.fiction book. After 684 pages I found myself reading: :""Hey wait a minute!""Wher's Dany and the dragons? Where's Tyrion? We hardly saw Jon Snow. That can't be all of it""... I felt cheated. How is it possible that after all thoses pages the author says he didn't have pages enough to talk about them??? That the author had to slpit the book in 2 parts???.... :[And at the meam time we should be more than happy to read about Lady Brienne? Cersei? (mind that she didn't do anything new that you didn't already know that she wanted to do)? May be Fantasy books should be taken more seriously when written. This one seams just another one to make money and pay the bills!"
3,Did Jordan corner Martin???,"It troubles me to make the comparison, yet it's what I've come away with after reading the book. I truly love the series and A Feast for Crows had its moments, but was dissapointing compared to the other books in the series. Hopefully a special edition will be published to include books 4 and 5. So much potential wasted here.Edit: I've read all the series books in the last month since hearing about this author. I had no idea it was 5 years between books 3 and 4. If I were a longtime reader, I'd have to pull a Stannis and take a knuckle from the author! For shame!"
5,"If you don't give it a 5, you didn't got to the bottom of it...","Albeit the murederous title, i must add a disclaimer. If my expectations and foretelling of why some things happend or will happen in SoIaF future novels, will not come true, then I would back down my recomendation and station my score at a mediocre 3.I believe there is reason behind what seems like a dreary setting of pawns on some peripherial borders of a chess board. I believe there is a long term strategy behind this act, and i'm basing my belief on Martin's former performence. He hasn't let me down in the former chapters of his tale, and since his website (and him through it) claims the series will most probably conclude in book seven, then book four/five should be the beginning of what should be a delicate and elaborate master-piece of modern fantasy plot writing work.With great expectations come... well, this time I hope the idiom would end differently. Don't we all..? Not just now, this time..?N."
2,A real low mark in an otherwise marvellous serie.,"I'm sorry to say it but this book was a chore to go through. Only one or two chapters (like where Brienne fights Biter) were exiting.In the end of the book the author explains that instead of splitting one book into two parts, he decided to make two separate books which in short resulted in putting all the booring characters into this book. Big mistake I'd say.As in all his books the writing is excellent but here you rarely got that nice urge of wanting to read the next page.Anyways... The other books in this serie are absolutely marvellous and likely the remaining books will be as well."
2,Sooooooo disappointed!,"I found the first three books utterly engrossing and devoured them in record time, loving every storyline and the author's writing style, despite the fact that some of my favorite characters were horribly slaughtered. I could not wait for A Feast for Crows and had almost given up hope that it would ever be released. Now, after years of anticipation, I'm slogging through it, searching for a story. Yes, the attention to detail is glorious, but for me, meaningless. I want attention paid to the characters and storylines that matter; instead, I'm overwhelmed with names, places, histories, mythologies, geneologies . . . . . . I find myself skipping entire chapters just to get to something interesting. It would never have occurred to me to skip a single word of the previous three books. I can only hope the next book will be better. Regardless of what I think of A Feast for Crows, I intend to see the series through because the initial story was so incredibly compelling."
2,Song of Ice and Fire jumps the shark,"The Song of Ice and Fire started out with a bang, giving me hopes that a modern author might equal the likes of Tolkien. But AFFC turned out to be a total let-down, sinking the series from potential classic to a never-ending marathon that you wish had never begun.As the series title would imply, the story is supposed to be about ice (short for the evil creatures raising havoc in the north) and fire (the dragons), but neither dragons nor northern evil spirits get any real attention in the book. It seems GRRM has lost interest in actually telling a story, preferring to introduce a never-ending stream of characters, who criss-cross the same lands without any apparent purpose."
2,A long book about nothing......,"I loved the first three books. This book reminds me of Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"", if you read it. It started out great and then just took a detour. Book focuses on too many characters and much plotting by them. I think this book lost focus all together compared to the previous three books. I have a feeling that if I skip this book altogether and read the next one I wouldn't miss much. Granted the next book is in line with the first three.Author gives very good description of places and characters travel but nothing happens. Some minor character got killed here and there, another character took its place and that is about it.Very disappointing, but still gave it two starts because the first three books were GREAT and hoping the next book will be like the first three."
3,Is greed going to win out again?,"I loved the first two of the game of thrones books, I had somehow come to the conclusion that there were four books in the series and that it would end there. Now it seems there is no end in sight and I wonder if this is Terry Goodkind all over again. A genius writer who starts out flooring everyone with his story weave but simply refuses to end the tale. Perhaps they have publishers telling them that ten books is a good idea for a series or maybe it is their own folly but either way I find it a shame that they would rather make more money then end it well and in a reasonable amount of books (3-4) and go down in history for it. I suffered through at least 8 unnecessary books from Goodkind that left a sour taste in my mouth I will not be repeating that mistake."
2,Second half is just boring,"Books becomes increasing boring with each chapter. Sexual content (lesbian, 13 year old girls) is increasingly added for no apparent reason. Many chapters are just people sitting around telling stories about things that have nothing to do with series. If this was the first book in the series,GRR Martin would not have been heard of- this book is that bad."
4,One point off for publishing...,"I understand the dilemma. The book is just too big to publish in a single volume. Hooray! More of the Seven Kingdoms to enjoy! That's a dilemma I can appreciate. However, I'm not sure I approve of the way the division was done. How much ground are we going to be rehashing in the next volume by going back in time to cover events being experienced by the characters not seen in this book?That aside, I have to say how much I love this series. I have been waiting with bated breath for this book for years, and my only disappointment, as I have mentioned, is with the editing decision to remove several characters until the next book. Several of my favorite characters, I might add. For the past week, I have lived in the Seven Kingdoms. When I was not actively reading, I was wishing I was reading. When I was reading, I was scolding myself to read slower, and make it last. I need more!MR. MARTIN - PLEASE WRITE FASTER!!!"
2,The power behind the throne.,"I discovered this series about 3 months ago. I read the first three in about 3 weeks. The rest of the time was spent suffering through the latest installment.The only explanation I can come up for the shortcomings/style of this book is that Danielle Steele must have been the ghost co-author.I feel bad about writing this because I really enjoyed the first three novels, but I will read the reviews BEFORE I buy the next one."
2,A Long Look at the Inner Life of Cersei Lannister,"A Feast for Crows was disappointing. Reading through Cersei's chapters was a boring, sometimes disgusting, slog -- and her chapters do dominate the book, as others have pointed out.I came to this book with no interest in what Cersei was thinking, and Feast did nothing to alter my opinion.As a whole, Feast seemed like a placeholder. Pages and pages of set-up, with no progression or resolution in this installment.Arya, Jaime, and Sam make appearances. Cersei, however, is the only character who has any agency in book four.The first three were so fantastic that no review stopped me from reading the fourth. I guess I have now joined the club."
3,A little tedious,"This was, by far, the least entertaining of the four novels. I had a really hard time getting through this book. BUT...I trust Mr. Martin. He's a great author. It may be that to have the epic finish he envisions for this wonderful series, he needed to slow down a bit. I'll read the rest hoping he's just been structuring a stronger ending to the series than he originally intended."
5,A good Read,"If you want a top notch fantasy novel, that doesn't protect its characters this is the book for you. The 4th book in the amazing series Song of Ice and Fire, A Feast For Crows. Picks up where the 3rd book left off and takes you on amazing journey through Westeros as the large cast of characters contuines on their quests, dreams and grabs for power. If you want a well crafted story where characters feel alive and you cringe when they die this the book for you. This book isnt for those who just want a fun adventure where you know the heores will make it, but if you want a rich fantasy world where the characters come alive this is the series for you."
4,Reconsideration,I thought the same as many of you about the book being dull till i got to the review where a person explained that the lamd is currently devastated from the raiding and the utter dissolvement of any safety the people of westeros had. 4 & 5 are setting up a 6th that will probaly rival the 3rd which is clearly the best one. All i can say is that we have to be patient and there is supposed to be 12 books in this saga so maybe better things are to come. we arent even halfway done!
2,hope the next book is better,"I found this to be the least enjoyable of the books in this series. Where the other books were page turners, i found this one to go on and on about characters that were not compelling and i had little love of. I also found the attention paid to new character did little to add to the major themes of the book, i actually found it very distracting."
2,disappointed,"It is a real shame such an excellent series has devolved to this. Mr. Martin is an excellent writer, but he appears to have been hijacked by fame, I suppose.I hope the HBO series catalyzes some movement in the story."
5,Slowest of the series,"This is probably my least favorite entry in the series, but that does not mean I did not think the book was great. Following the incredible third book, it really is a change of pace and many of my favorite characters did not even get chapters (had to wait till book five to get theirs). This is essentially one humongous book that was split into books four and five, so things are going to be different than what you are used to. That said, it is still an amazing entry in the series that is necessary to set up what is in store."
2,anti climax abounds here,"there is not much resolved in this book although there are some definite ends to some of the characters. mostly we read about Cersei and her point of view, jealousy of King Tommen's bride and her schemes to thwart her. i liked the first three books, but this one was tedious and boring. There is nothing mentioned about my favorite character so far, Daenaerys:("
2,A Feast For Crows audiobook CD's,"The box arrived crushed;Have not finished listening to the whole thing, but the first 2 disks had globs of something at the end that made them unplayable. We were unable to wipe it off."
2,Drawn out extended plot about characters you don't care about.,Unlike the earlier books in the series. Many of the main characters are simply missing from this book. The last chapter is basically an apology from George about this.The plot is lacking the momentum of all its predecessors. Switching viewpoint very often to people not mentioned again.Cerci has much of her tale told and we do get further insights to her Character. The lady of Tar th continues her quest but I don‘t feel she was as rounded as she could be.Struggled to keep reading where before I struggled to put the others down
2,Oh well.,"This was a mediocre book, standing by itself. If I put it up against the first two, lets just say its no ""Empire Strikes Back."" I found myself getting dug in to the main character stories and then trudging through second and third tier character chapters so I could get to the main characters again. In some cases, even skipping ahead if I lost patience with the ""boring parts."" ASOS would have probably dissuaded me from continuing the series, if I had to wait another 4 years like those reading them as the books come out. Suffice it to say, I am on the other side of this one and hoping the next one is better."
2,Disappointed - boooring,"Really liked the first three books, couldn't wait to begin the next one (this one). What a disappointment! There were several times I almost quit reading it. It just drags on with minor characters, side stories that don't really contribute, etc, etc. I see many other reviews that also agree. Where the heck were the editors? This smells of greed. Instead of editing this down to a tighter, more interesting read, I believe the publisher let George run wild and by his own admission break this into two books (twice the profit!).I'll still give the next one a try since I'm invested, but if it's just as boring I'm done with the series."
4,A Good Read,"And left me looking for book 5, still suffering from withdrawal. This series involve the reader - Martin tells a superb yarn"
4,Feast for crows,I love to hate this series! The story is great but sometimes so many names get tossed around that I get lost. Can't wait to get started on the next one :)
4,It's all downhill after 'Storm of Swords',"After all the epic, back-stabbery of the previous volume, 'Feast for Crows' takes a while to get going as the initial chapters start off from the perspective of new characters and locales but once this one picks up steam it offers everything that one would expect from this series - particularly the final fifth of the book. And yes, while most of the complaints of this volume are valid I found the extra attention to detail and minutiae a somewhat nice change of pace and appreciated the added layers of world building that fleshes out this world in ways that appeal to the most OCD of lore-hounds."
2,Not impressed,"I guess money is a great motivator for procrastination and dawdling because this book goes nowhere fast. I'm sure that the author wants to milk HBO for all the money he can and I have no problem with that fact. I do think that he forgot about his fans and how much they are willing to tolerate.I don't want to give it away but, this book is by far the most rambling and absurd in the series. I am probably not going to spend any further money or time on this series. The writing is interesting and superb writing, however, it has broken clear from any sort of plot and characters that were built up in the last three books. I am now of the mind frame of who cares what happens next. Whatever the author does have take place in future writings, I'm sure it will be long and tedious."
4,The End Chapters Are Worth It,"I really enjoyed this book, but the beginning and middle parts were pretty slow. The ""boring"" chapters were still interesting if you were trying to piece everything together and really think about what is going on in the book. While I agree with the other readers that this book was less exciting than the previous books, I don't think someone who has read the first three books should end there. Some of the chapters were really well done and I really enjoyed the surprise near the end."
3,Bad sequence for the Saga,Author pursued a weak line on the sequence for the Saga. Some of the characters were not even cited on this book. I hope next one will make up for it.
2,Long walk for a small drink,I began to realize that the problem with Martin's capacity to kill off characters on a whim (which is starting and cool at the time) tends to kill all the momentum that he creates to that point in time.This book felt like one of Robert Jordon's books between 6-9. Nothing happened and you know that it will be forever till you see the next real book. I know that he split the book but my understanding is that he will focus on the other characters. So all that means is that we can expect very little progress in their lives as well.
1,Seriously?,"After 4,000 pages and 14 years, this is where we are? Really? The book was too big so we've split it into two parallel books? Again, really?The first three books were outstanding. Time to start getting some resolution here. Get on with it or pull the plug."
3,I wanted to...,"I wanted to give this book a raving, positive review in light of the previous excellent books in the series, but in all honesty, I just can't do it.I fear that Martin has fallen in line with the Jordan debacle, The Wheel of Time, although I'm reluctant to make that comparison (not too reluctant, because I just did it). The first books of this series were unlike any I had ever read, and still rate number one in my list of favorites, but this volume has me rethinking.Publishing concerns aside, someone dropped the ball on this one. It is good, don't misunderstand me, but I don't think it's on par with the rest of this excellent series.I recommend you read it and see what you think, but it may not be something you want to rush out and buy in hardback. Jordan has convinced me that going to your local library first might be an excellent idea."
2,Writer desperately in need of editor and strong handed agent.,"Perhaps it was inevitable (but certainly not necessary) that Martin would hit a creative wall. Following the rather spectacular third installment, Feast for Crows is an example of a writer treading water, producing mounds of details that really go nowhere. Sure, for the detail obsessed, knowing the biblical equivilants of what king ""beget"" whom (and correspondingly, who chopped off whose head) will be enormously satisfying - I am sure those are the same ones who feel a need (no, responsibility) to learn Klingon before they can truly understand Star Trek... Or maybe, they can be that much more ""correct"" at the next Renaissance fair).The sense of inertia in this latest installment is Martin fairly screaming his need for a strong handed agent or editor. Stop dithering and get on with it Man!"
2,How do books like this get published?,"I love this story and the characters in it but it has become so complex that I can't keep track of all of the peripheral characters. Especially when they are referred to by their first name or their last name or their title or their nickname, all in one paragraph.With such long lag times between books it is impossible to remember all of the minutiae that Martin packs into his stories. He should give his readers a break and let the editors do their jobs. Wait for the next one to come out before you read this one."
2,Tough going,"Many of the characters in Martin's saga face fearsome odds as they slog around Westeros and elsewhere, through snow, rain and blistering heat. I felt their pain -- often this monsterously long book felt like a slow march to an uncertain destination.A few faithful characters keep parts of the tale alive - Brienne, Arya - but I found myself skipping whole pages filled with names, lineage, obtuse history, or back stories of back stories. But most of all, I missed Tyrion.Too bad, the first few books are very, very good."
2,The Reader of the Audio Book Takes Away from a Good Story,"The story is good, I understanding breaking this apart from ""A Dance With Dragons"". Content is pretty much up to par with the first three books.But I've listened to these all on audiobooks, and the reader of this one simply isn't cut out for the job. The first three books were very professionally read by a reader that sounded like he slipped right out of the story. I keep expecting the reader of this one to break into ""Bueller?....Bueller?....Bueller?""Very monotone, no expression. It's sad how much this can distract from a good book. Crossing my fingers in hopes that a different reader was brought on board for ""ADWD""."
2,meandering...a tough one to get through,"A disappointing book...after LOVING the first 3 books, it now officially feels like Martin is milking a cash cow. Nevertheless, highlights for me were the Jaime and Brienne's chapters. The rest...slow...meandering...Debating whether or not I want to continue on to the next book."
2,What a disappointment,"I really enjoyed the first three books but was SO disappointed with this one. Talk about going nowhere with a lot of words. I probably enjoyed 1 in 10 to 20 chapters. The rest just felt like fluff...no substance to speak of and I can't even say that (most of it) is setting the stage for things to come in any obvious way. Most of it was a huge struggle for me to even get through because it was so unbelievably boring, especially following Storm of Swords, which was probably my favorite of the series so far.On the positive side, I did learn a lot more about the characters, despite the stagnant plot development."
2,Tough Going,"You are invested in the series. You need to read this book because things are developing, and you don't want to miss out. This book will barely hold your attention, yet you will slog on, so that went the next book comes out you can read it. I read the previous three books in a week. This is the shortest of the series and it took a month. Looking forward to the next just so it can talk about characters I actually care about."
2,zzzzzzz,"Sooooo disappointed. I loved the first three books and kept waiting for this one to capture my interest. Sounds like the newest addition just adds to the overwritten, told-not-shown, barely-edited spiral this awesome series has devolved into. 'Tis a pity."
2,Big disappointment,"The first two books of these series were amazingly good. The third was good, but dragged a bit. This was so bloated and useless. The characters you care about from the beginning of the series are not written about. New characters that are boring and do not do anything for the plot are introduced. (Who cares about the Ironmen?!). I thought this was going to wrap up the series, but it just was filler used as an excuse to write more books and make more money."
3,wtf? but the others were so good...,"Not what I was hoping for. It seems as if only following half the characters brought half the excitement...or less. The first three books took only took a me a few days a piece to finish, this one took me a few weeks. I found my self trying to justify skipping entire sections of the book just to be nearer the end. To be clear, not a horrible book, just not up to par with his others. I can still say I'm looking forward to book five with a lot of enthusiasm."
2,Should have been condensed to 200 pages,"... and actually, it probably could have been condensed to 100 pages. The very few interesting sections (i.e. the bits about Arya) were precisely very few. Most of the book was Cersei and Jaime and Brienne. Cersei is approximately Lady Macbeth and nothing really needed to be said, except that she's neurotic and evil. Finally by the end of the book she got locked up. Jaime is really kind of tedious. Brienne... I'm sympathetic to her, but she sort of wandered around a lot, and accomplished exactly nothing, except that she got a little bit eaten. Why did we have to spend so much time on her.I'd excerpt, pretty much, just the last couple chapters of Cersei, the stuff about Dorne, and the Arya stuff, oh and the Kings moot - and skip the rest of the the book. I skimmed the vast majority of it. SO boring. At least the book before, and the book after, were enjoyable."
2,Not on point,Tell a story...don't force readers to trudge through your spewings. Get an editor and LISTEN to him/her!!
3,"interesting, but...","I don't want to bash this book too badly, because it was very interesting. I really loved the first three books, and was one of the many who waited and waited. That said, I agree with those who say that it was too long for so little to happen. Sure, it's only half the story, blah blah, but it was still too much minutia. I loved the minutia in the earlier books, but this book needed more tweaking to take it from tedium to fascination.If a 1000-page book -- two years overdue -- is something that can be a rushed job, then this is it. That said, I'm still interested, and must follow this ""trilogy"" to its ""conclusion"". Just don't take my determination to read all the books as an opportunity to rest on your laurels, Mr. Martin!"
2,deeply saddened,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I invested time and money. I was so dissappointed. I generally speed read over the fluff so when I finished this book in three days I was deeply saddened to have not gotten any news of some of my favorite characters. I have read the reviews on Dances with Dragons and it looks like more of the same. I wont be making the same mistake twice. It will be difficult to leave in the middle, leave so many questions about my favorite characters but from the review of book five even if I read it, I will not get any satisfaction. So I will just patiently wait for book six read those reviews and judge whether it is worth getting back into the game."
4,merlin,"I think it is better than some of the reviews I have seen, but it does wander a little. It jumps from Briennewandering around looking for Sansa to the power struggle in the Iron islands. If you liked the first three,it is similar,but lt is less focused."
2,moves too slow,Those people that gave it a three were being kind in memory of the first three books. Do not expect anything as good as the first three books in the series.
3,Slower than the first 3,"Slower and longer than the first 3 books, and it doesn't include all of the characters, but that is explained at the end of the book. Overall a good read."
2,Book 4 - eh,"I'll keep it short ...while you will wade through it, waiting for ANYthing, book 4 pretty much sucked. Didn't stop me from buying book 5. Even with the apologia at the end of 4, it was still not a very good book. Book 5 is getting back to speed ... we'll see...it's getting back to the characters I want to know about (tho, C1 totally baffled me). Oh. I'm a Tyrion fan."
2,Disappointing,This one just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening. Books one and two in the series were really good reads though.
3,Crow Bait Indeed,"I was so completely enjoying this series through the first three books. In fact, I gave the first three in this series 5 stars.Enter stage: ""The Great Distractions""... suddenly Mr Martin has a world full of distractions and deadlines. Movie deals in discussion, other side-book series deals bombarding him like a firestorm. It became obvious that his concentration and focus were lost. Starting with this book 'A Feast for Crows', the series has gone into steep decline.Where there was intrigue and intense political plot, there remained only rehash and a shell of what once-was. It is almost as if he turned the project over to another author, whom I apparently do not care for.My disappointment has been palpable with what has transpired since. My recommendation is to read the first three... they are excelent!... but be content to leave it at that."
2,I can't believe this is from Martin,I greatly enjoy the first few books in the series and was greatly surprised when I read this one. It seems Martin was too daring and bold with his killing off of main characters in the previous books in the series. Now what we are left with are mostly uninteresting characters and some of the characters that we have come to love have changed enough that they seem like a different person altogether. Killing off interesting main characters is not the problem it's when an author chooses to clean house and gets rid of MOST of the characters that actually made the stories so great is really the problem. We could loss one or two good characters but Martin killed so many of them. This book really does feel like a different book entirely from the series. I'm hoping the next book will introduce some new and more interesting characters.
2,"After ""Feast for Crows"" I doubt this series will ever be finished","As others have said, there was very little plot advancement, and way to much time spent on very minor characters. With gaps of years between each volume, I've frankly forgotten most of the characters and events, and after ""Feast for Crows"" I realize I simply don't care about this story.At this pace, it will be decades before the series is finished, if the publisher doesn't simply pull the plug."
5,Got what I expected,"Great book, exactly what I expected, it was affordable, no problems to read it on my tablet. Ill be the next book in an electronic format too."
4,not as good as the first two,"I almost gave up on this series because Arya's story was just plain depressing, however, Martin keeps coming up with twist after twist so i can't put them down"
3,A little bit slower than the others,"As a big fan of the series, this book was a little bit less exciting than the others. Especially after the first three, which I could not put down. We're introduced to a lot of new characters that aren't as interesting as the 'main' characters and the story doesn't move along much. The bits with Arya, Jaime, Cersei, and Sam are still good and it does pick up a little bit at the end. Still a good book for sure, just not on the same level as A Storm of Swords."
5,winter is coming,"Admittedly not as intense as ""A Storm of Swords"" kinda drug on with the goings on at Kings Landing. But the dialogue with Sam and Maester Aemon was beautiful."
3,Feast for crows,"George RR Martin claimed to have no choice but to split up the characters between books 4 and 5 which are to cover the same time period. Not having read book 5 yet, I feel that he had two paths to choose, both of which weren't good paths, and chose the path he thought was best for the readers. I had a lot of trouble keeping focused while reading book 4...I believe that the framework from the first 3 and what I have coming up in 5 will prove that 4 is a better book than I can give it credit at the moment. I'm likely to re-read the series when done, because there are just too many characters to keep up with and references to characters you really might not care about in the least bit. Overall, I still rate the book series at an enthusiastic 5 stars! I hope to see book 6 come out sometime in 2013, before I forget what I've read. :-)"
3,Audio impressions,"I have not finished this book. Actually, I have recently begun the audio book, and am about about 4 hours in.I am so surprised the the same reader can be so inconsistent. He is pronouncing names differently (the first 3 books were very consistent), and the voices are all over the place (Aria sounds like Egret now). He's not just now pronouncing the names differently than the first three books, but differently in this same book! (Bri-een, and bree-en, cate-uh-lyn, as opposed to cat-uh-lyn, are just some examples) Very disappointing.I'm trying to look past the terrible audio presentation, and hopefully the story itself will stand out (though peeking at some reviews for the book itself are not so favorable).I will stick it out as the first 3 books were great. I just had to comment on how the audio is so inconsistent, from the same reader!"
2,Zzzzz,"Holy smokes, was this book boring. In this non-page-turner, Martin seems more interested in indulging his fetish for turning a phrase -- phrase after phrase after phrase -- than in advancing the various plot-lines. This was already a little bit true in #3 but it's especially true here. I finished the tome mainly as a matter of principle. But I've now officially soured on attempting #5 and am sorely tempted to let HBO filter any subsequent volumes for me."
3,a feast for crows,Not as good as the first three. It was very rambling. Seemed like he was just trying to fill pages in many cases.
5,Great series,"George Martin has succeeded in creating one of the best fantasy epics ever, and it continues here again, with his compelling characters and well plotted story. Unlike, say, Robert Jordan, he has not gotten lost in conceit and drivel. The story moves forward and has clear tension and struggle, moving towards confrontation. If I have one quibble with this, and books like it, at this point it would've been nice to have had a synopsis of the prior volumes. It's been awhile and there is a lot of prior story to remember. These long series can be hard to manage. (This was reviewed based on an ebook version...)"
3,A whole lot of nothing happens...,For the most part this book ia a major bore compared to the last three. It took me what seemed like forever to get through it :(One can only hope that he improves in the next installment.
3,Love the Series,"I have not read this book yet but have read the previous ones,which are great.I refuse to read this one untill ""part 2"" of it comes out and I can read the complete book.That being said do you people get the feeling Martin is getting too distracted with other projects?I mean when this book was coming out he said how he was chopping it in half and the other half was more than half done.Well it's been 8 months since this release.If you go to his web site you can detect that ""part 2"" isn't close to being done.In fact all Martin does is discuss every thing under the sun he's working on Besides this book.I understand that he has a life to live too but come on,stop the touring and other projects and write your bread and butter!!One exciting thing is that HBO is looking into making a ""Deadwood""type of Series based on these books.Maybe that will finally ""prod"" MArtin to actually right the rest of the series."
2,Disappointing,"A Feast for Crows comes nowhere near its predecessors. The plot is at best thin, and the novel becomes a travelogue for Martin's more uninteresting characters as they journey from point A to B. Where is that sharp, tight novel with characters to care about and a plot that surprises? If you do not expect too much from this book, you will not be disappointed."
4,The saga continues...,"Whether you are a fan of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", don't worry, because you are going to love this book. It maintains the thrill, the interest and the overall quality of the other three books. But, the truth must be the said, you really miss the main characters. That is because in this book Martin depicts essentially the whereabouts in the south of Westeros, and in the next book he will deal with The Wall and The Dragons. But I think that this is only to give us an spectacular ""A dance with dragons"", with all our favourite characters together."
3,Not great,"I love the first three books. However, this one really seems to just meander around with not much happening. I found myself daydreaming as I was reading throughout most of the book. There are some good parts, but I wish I would have got this one from the library.I am not a big fan of abridged audio books, but I thinki that would be the best way to get this installment. I really hope that Martin does a better job with Dance of Dragons otherwise I am finished with his books."
1,Where are the characters we care about??,"I was riveted by ""Storm of Swords"" and couldn't wait to dive into ""Feast of Crows."" Ugh, what a bore. Everyone we've come to love and love to hate are either dead or mysteriously absent from this volume. The storyline is shattered, new characters and houses and sers are introduced every chapter and I have absolutely no idea who they are and don't even care. What a mess and disappointment. Forget it if you want to know what's happening with Tyrion, Jon, Bran and Daenerys, they don't even show up in this book. The entire book seems like one long Cersei whine-fest. I tried but I'm bailing at page 531 and will just wait for the next book to find out what happens to the characters we really care about."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I am such a huge fan of the series and plowed through the first 3 books. I couldn't put them down. After the long patient wait for Feast For Crows I find myself very disappointed. It doesn't even come close to the excitment the previous books put you through. But, Alas, it is a must read regardless (if your a fan of the series). Just drink LOTS of coffee, finish it & pray the next book is back on track & is released a little sooner than 5 years! 5 years???"
2,Make It Fly!,"My brother-in-law introduced this series to me 2 years ago. I picked up A Game of Thrones and didn't emerge until I finished Storm of Swords. I loved it! I couldn't imagine how all you day one, die hard fans of Martin had managed to wait so long for the next installment. My own anticipation was keen to say the least. But, oh boy!...I threw A Feast for Crows down at one point and told my husband (and his brother) that I was done with Martin. If I had to read one more chapter on Cersei I would gag! There wasn't enough ""good"" character chapters to balance her out. She is not even excitingly evil. She is just despicable mixed with foolish. Why can't Martin throw her out the moon door, too? MAKE HER FLY! I would be glad to shove. Heck, maybe even throw this book out with her. Okay, in all seriousness, I did finished the book. It was tough but I feel it was for the greater good. It had a few merits. Here's hoping for a better 5! I haven't lost faith completely..."
1,Why did they change the narrator?,"I share the concern of many of the reviewers who wonder if Martin will take twelve years to tie up all the loose threads he's woven into this amazing series, but even so this book still delivers a wonderful story with compelling characters and adroit writing.However, why on earth did they switch narrators? Roy Dotrice was an amazing reader. In fact, much of my enjoyment of the first three books was due to his narration, which made even Martin's obsession with long and detailed accounts of what everyone is wearing worth listening too, and the voices of each of the characters brought the dialogue and even the folk songs to a whole new level of brillance. It was jarring and disappointing to have a different narrator, even if that narrator was a good, which unfortunately he is not.One of the biggest disappointments in my audio book listening experience."
2,Boring,"After reading the first three books in a non stop fashion I found this fourth book boring and I was not excited to pick it up and read it at the end of the day. The characters and plot lines were dull. However as it is the fourth book in the series I guess I have to plod through it. I hope the fifth installment, if it ever gets released, is back to the excitement and the interesting plot lines of the first three."
2,Tedious at best - avoid,"This was really terrible, no one you are interested in is in it. Wait till the next book is out and just skip this one."
2,I think I'm done with this series,"I could not put down A Game of Thrones the first time I picked it up. And this was well before there was a television series on HBO. I thought it was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. I liked the second book as well, but not as much. And I didn't care for all the supernatural elements that emerged so heavily in the third book, but I kept going. I'm almost finished with this, the fourth book in the series, and I give up. I find myself so bored by this book that I don't care if I finish it. It just doesn't hold my attention. Maybe too many Starks and other characters I like were killed off. Maybe too many of the relationships between characters that I enjoy were severed. Maybe there are just too many characters that I don't care about or like reading from their point of view being introduced, or too many characters period. I'm not exactly sure what the problem is, I just know that it does not make for good reading anymore and I give up."
3,Could be worse...,"So far, this is probably the worst book of the series. It seems they gradually get worse by the number. I have yet to read ""A Dance With Dragons"", so I can't really comment on that.It starts out very slow, and a lot of it seems to just drag on. You really just want to get the main points of the stories instead of just listening to a bunch of random dialog from the characters. I found out that since most of my favorite characters have all perished and the others not in this book, I was disappointed.If you are a big fan of the series, I recommend reading it to keep the story going. If you didn't care for the previous books then I wouldn't bother."
2,"i accidently deleted it from my kindle halfway through, but i am really not interested in trying to finish it. ....","i could not finish this book, like most readers, i loved the first three. sped right through them, but good lord! what the hell ?? i mean, i know its hard to come up with a story after the last book, but really, do we really have to be with so many characters each and every tiny movement throughout the book!!! i only gave 3 stars because i didnt finish it. if the 6th book is about redemption and full revenge, than maybe ill get that one...."
4,You're in the game; shut up and read,"I was apprehensive about reading this after looking at a few unfavorable reviews. The fact of the matter is that after having read the previous books there wasn't any way I wasn't going to read this one. Could it be better? Sure. Do those of us who have been reading the series have some opinions as to where the plot should be going? Of course. Is the writing becoming a bit formulaic? Hmmm. But you know something? In the final analysis, I read the book with greedy self-indulgence. The story continues!~!~ And there's more to come!!! So what's the problem? Just tell old GRR to boot up his computer and generate another volume. I'm ready!! JK"
1,Audio version,"I have not finished the book so I don't want to give an opinion about the book itself, but I have listened to the first two CDs. The reader used for this book is more disgraceful than the most ridiculous impression of William Shattner. The way he reads mocks every word of the story, with non-sensicle pacing and changes in intensity that make it difficult to keep up with the volume control. The first three books had a reader that was the best I've ever heard, this one is simply the worst. Please Random House and George Martin bring back Roy Dotrice.I had trouble listening to this in the car because he goes from whispers to shouts, I could not find a volume setting where I could hear all the words and my ears weren't bleeding."
2,Another Robert Jordan?,"The other reviews, covering how painfully slow this book is, are spot on. All that I can think of are Robert Jordan's tedious books four, five, six and seven (""The Shadow Rising,"" ""Fires of Heaven,"" ""Lord of Chaos"" and ""A Crown of Swords"").Is Martin walking down the road that Jordan took years ago? I hope not."
3,Don't go George Lucas on us Mr. Martin,"Okay, so I just got into this series and I flew through book one because it was just that good. Book 2 was good but Book 3 really righted the ship. After ending book three with an awesome epilouge, I could not wait for Book four...and I couldn't have been more disappointed. Nothing happened. Not only did nothing major happen, but some characters we were all wondering about weren't even addressed with their own chapters. I have to hope for more from the upcomming ""A Dance with Dragons"". Please right the ship George.You'll buy this book because you loved the others but it won't be as fondly remembered as the others."
3,"Good, but not on par with the first 3 books","I got about half way thru and starting thinking ""This is kinda slow moving"".Lots of names and character and family histories. Martin commonly goes thru a character's entire lineage, even for characters that are barely relevant.It took until Brienne's battle with Biter 1/2 way thru for me to start thinking ""Now this is what I was expecting"". But it doesnt last.There are many very interesting plot lines, but its mainly all political, very little action.Definitely worth a read, just dont expect the same level of excitement as in the previous books"
3,"A little slow, but still a good read.","The fourth book in the Song of Fire and Ice series isn't as good as the previous three. It's a little slow (he's veering a little too close to Robert Jordan for my taste), but it's still a good read and a definite recommendation for fans of the series."
5,"Love the book, Love the series!","If you like fantasy, but are looking for something more adult in nature, then A Song of Ice and Fire series should be on your shelf. George R. R. Martin is an excellent writer, and every book is exciting with great character development. I have read the first four, and I plan to read the next three. Highly recommended"
2,"A fantastic trilogy, a middling n-ogy","The first book established characters, a world, and managed to have an interesting plot. A large part of that plot came to an end in book 3. I figured the fourth book would follow the first and establish new characters and have an interesting plot. It did neither.Book four floundered along and I was only able to skim it and not read the entire book. This has happened to me before in another series, the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. Apparently, when an author meets with amazing success with a series, there is a strong urge to crank out lots of pages and not worry about keeping the readers interested. This author uses the same devices to crank out boring page after boring page, meaningless detail and frivolous trivia.This series has definitely jumped the shark."
2,A Feast for Crows,"I found it extremely hard to continue reading, the characters that once held my interest have since been eliminated, the only reason I read it throughout was simply to complete the series."
3,Excluding the main characters of the first 3 books?,"I will start by saying that I love the series, and will stick with it till the end.However coming off the tremendous high that was ""A Storm Of Swords"" this one was a bit of a let down.Too many new characters are introduced, and while some are quite good like Cersei and Brienne, many others make you wonder why they are there in the first place.Maybe once all the books are done this one will grow to become more appreciated, but for me it was a bit of a gamble that did not pay off.Still, like I said, bring it on Martin, you have me till the end."
1,All Filler,The Others are not mentioned. Tyrion and Daenerys do not appear. Jon Snow hardly does. Nothing major happens not even close to what happens in the prior books. My only guess is that he saving everything until the last book but right now I really don't care. Will skip the next one and just wait for the last. What a waste.
2,Worst of the four,"The book had some important plot items... but over all I skimmed half the book. Don't want to read about Cersis experimental escapades, or how Jamie has suddenly found a halo. New characters I care nothing about or know how the will impact the final story. I just hoping the next book will be back to the old format."
2,"Tangential, disappointing","I was looking forward to Feast of Crows, believing I'd find out what happened to the remaining Stark family members and further enjoy the development of their characters. With every chapter and point of view from yet another little known character, I found myself saying - out loud - ""focus George, focus."" He never did. I truly hope the next book returns to the story as laid out in the first couple of books and these loose fluttering extraneous characters either fly off in the wind or somehow come together in some meaningful, believable way. I would hate to have the Stark and the direwolves' story line left unanswered at the end of five books."
4,A Great Storyteller,"I find this series to be...addictive. Martin does a great job with character development, and you really feel like you're diving into the world of the Game of Thrones. This installment, while having less action creates a tension from the build-up of what may happen in the next book."
4,Underrated book,"I thought it was very good, but not as good the first three. Perhaps my opinion would be more jaded had I waited 4 years like the people who actually had to wait for this one."
4,Well it is not a storm of swords,"After reading the Exilarating story,you just want to keep reading through it and see how it is going to unfold and resolve; me as an anime lover I don't mind about fillers,because it shows me more details of characters I know and love or at least love to hate,in this book you will get plenty of both ,if you like to read and if you are engulfed by aoiaf like I am this is a good book, not poorly written or uninteresting but not focused on main cool characters,let's say its more from the point of view of king's landing,good reading though."
3,Marking time,"This book does not contain the action nor the interest of the previous three books in the series. I typically like GRRM's writing, but I do not think it is as important as the plot. In this book, the plot fails to hold together.Editing of this book to only include characters from certain regions of the realm is ok, but the lack of action is the problem."
1,What a disappointment!!,"I loved the first three books in this series. I could not wait for Feast of Crows to come out. After the first 50 pages, and nodding off several times I knew something was wrong. Simple put, it was boring. The author seems to have lost his voice and intensity. The characters lacked action, interest and engagement. They were flat and the plot wandered around aimlessly. I forced myself to finish when I realized there was another book coming out. Also, I was hoping that it would pick up.Save yourself some cash borrow it from the library or just skip it and go with Dance of the Dragons.Oh, I don't buy blaming the publisher. The author needs to control how his material is released and this book stands on its own merit not what it could have been or how it is related to the next book."
3,not as good,"The previous books were great. Maybe it was the editing or cutting the story in half, I do not know but it was not as good. Many of the chapters were boring and did little for the story.I look forward to the next book. Maybe it will complete this one as it should have been in the first place. If you have not read this one yet wait until the next one comes out.Really deserved about 3 1/2 stars but oh-well.I read the previous books in about a week each. This one took months just because the stories were not as intriguing."
3,Good - but not the strongest,"I would basically suggest this book is a fine addition to the series, but the weakest I have read so far. (I have yet to read past this particular entry.)It felt like a detour leaving some of my favourite characters behind to focus on others; While at the same time setting up new or under-utilized players for future events.I want to stay interested but I feel like I need my 'main' characters to be back in the spotlight."
5,Don't be fooled: it's always Martin!,"As many readers have noticed before, the ""A Song Of Ice and Fire"" books are the best fantasy books written in the last fifteen years. This 4th book is not as a masterpiece a s the previous three, but is still much better than any books from Jordan, Eddings, Brooks & similar writers. This book lacks my favourite characters: Jon, Daenerys and Tyrion; this is his great fault, but the story is interesting and well-written. The principal POV have complex personalities and struggle to keep theirselves alive in a hideous world full of treachery. The best storylines are about Jaime, the GreyJoys and the Dornishmen. I also enjoyed Samwell's chapters as well...only Brienne is a little boring, but the end is really astonishing. In the end, I think that the book is worth the reading, and Martin's style is over-the-top in the adult fantasy genre!"
5,Worth the wait,"This is George Martin at his best. The characters come alive, their emotions and thoughts are so vivid, they make reality feel distant.I am sad to see so many complaints about ""boring"" chapters in this book. This was not my experience at all. His characters are as complex and varied as....well, people. I feel as if I know the characters. The characters change over time, but do so believably (i.e. Jaime). Martin is a master of making the stories fantastic and realistic at the same time. If you want self-aggrandizing action and glam, go read the latest Mack Bolan and buy a Playboy or just channel surf). If you want something with a little more depth, pick up ""a Feast.."" It's worth the journey."
5,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.","The song of ice and fire continues with a relentless pace for a thrilling fourth time, are you ready for more blood and honor?"
3,Puzzled,Of all the series so far this has the most disjointed chapter structure.I'll admit that I'm not finished yet but that is because it is too easy to put down.
3,Memory,Not enjoying this as much as book three. There are soooooooo many names to remember and memory not my forte. Maybe it's me and not Mr. Martin.I do love the way he writes and describes things; almost feel like I'm there.I think I'm going to have to re-read them. A friend has read them all at least 3 times and says he picks up things he missed each time.
2,A Feast for Crows,"Compared to the first and second book in this series (A Song of Ice and Fire) ""A feast of Crows"" (which is book 4) is boring. It seemed to bog down in stratergy and personalities. I would not have kept reading but I really want to know what happens in the end. I get confused with all the house alliances and the names of the knights and families. Hoping that end of the series makes the read worthwhile."
2,A disappointment,"I really enjoyed the first 3 books in this series, but this one disappointed me. It seems disjointed and the character list is overwhelming. Maybe its me, but I had a hard time keeping the new characters straight."
4,Why the rush to get finished?,"I have read the other reviews and I don't disagree, it's not up to the level of the first three books. That being said, I didn't dislike it. Maybe I'm just not in as much of a hurry to get finished as other readers, but I enjoy the story (even though it moves at a glacial pace). It's like the lazy river at water parks. Just sit back and enjoy it."
2,Bothersome and boring.,"I was so disappointed with A Feast for Crows, where was the feast?, where were the crows? What was the word Brienne shouted? According to the reviews for A Dance With Dragons, we'll never know. Why all the new characters when we haven't finished with the the old? I was enthralled with the first three books, not so much with this one and I may not read the last (two if you want paperback). If I could ask one question it would be, ""Really George???"" Get new editors or learn how to finish a story. I hope the HBO series producers/directors take heed and give us something more satisfying."
1,A Feast For Crows,"What a disappointment! Martin's lame explanation at the end (what a relief!) of ""Feast"" did nothing to appease the disgust and frustration I felt almost immediately upon beginning the book and everything to reinforce my decision that I, for one, will not be reading any more ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" books.Martin succeeded in his cheap attempt to crank out a mindnumbingly lackluster collection of words.I took pity on his characters, not for the misfortunes that befell them in the book, but for being used so badly by their creator.Cross Martin off my list of authors to read!"
2,the opposite of page turner,"Okay, I'm perverse, I liked reading these books because they are only mildly interesting and VERY easy to put down, its great bathroom reading, but only there, and oh my god, who cares about all the customs, food, family trees if they are not in service to the story, yes, yes yes, all you Renaisance pleasure faire groupies love this stuff, but its not about the writing, which mostly sucks, there was one glorious point in all the four books that achieved something close to good writing where the dragon queen does not give up her one dragon and takes the army of slaves, this was an emotionally well wrought and satisfying plot turn, most everything else goes too slowly, and in strange, inappropriate directions, the worst problem is that I like the idea of complex characters changing through time, but this effort is buried in the sludge of extraneous detail and confusing, episodic inclusion of unimportant characters and actions."
2,Thank Goodness for Amazon.Com!,"I loved the first three books in this series and was eager to buy this volume. Fortunately I read the reviews on this site and saved my money. This was a good thing, because I borrowed the book from the library and was truly disgusted. George Martin is a terrific writer. There is no excuse for this tedious drivel. It is clearly an attempt to make more money by drawing out a story to fit two books."
3,Decent,"I'll keep this review short:After the first 3 books this was definitely a let down. Still worth reading, but here's to hoping A Dance With Dragons picks up with the intensity that Storm of Swords had..."
1,Big Disapointment!!,"I read the first 3 books in this series in less than 10 days (many sleepless nights!) My biggest annoyance was all the extraneous geneology and minor character details but the story was so good I pushed through anyhow. This new book is a slap in the face, basically it has mostly minor characters and nothing happens.Where is this guy's editor? It is not like he doesn't have enough interesting main characters already. Why not write about them? Yes, I know about the supposed 2000 page book split in half etc but he could have written the good book first. Instead we have to wait till 2007! I think he should write 2 versions of every book from now on one version with the great stories characters & twists the other with all the genealogy, excessive details and minor characters. Lets see which version sells better.Bottom Line , I feel betrayed."
5,Don't believe the hate.,"I don't understand all the hate for this book. I just finished this one and it is just as good as the other three. I was a little dismayed that I wouldn't get to read about Jon Snow, Daenerys, Davos, or Bran at first, but that passed! I thoroughly enjoyed reading about characters new and old. Perhaps especially the old ones, considering we hadn't got to see their perspective or what they were doing. I consider this to be sort of refreshing. I had been reading about the same dozen or so characters for about 3000 pages, and to pick up the book and read about others was nice. It lends the realm a realer feel. You get the feel that there are many characters involved, large and small, just like there is in life.As I said, don't believe the hate. This book is just as masterfully woven as the other three."
1,A waste of time,"Unless you have a lot of time to kill and are incredibly bored, simply read a summary of A Feast for Crows online. It will be more enjoyable and a better use of your time.The book goes on and on about plot points that seem irrelevant, especially with newer characters. There's no progress in any of the key plotlines that readers are interested in from the previous book (especially Games of Thrones), nor is there really any ray of light of hope that there will be progress or anything will get any better for them. Many important characters in the series don't even appear in Crows and are replaced with characters that seem irrelevant and unnecessary.It feels like the series has stalled out and GRRM is stringing the series along with filler until he gets to the final book."
3,A disappointment,"I loved the previous books in this series. I thought the third book was the best; every single chapter had a wow moment.A Feast for Crows, unfortunately, does not live up to its predecessors. I understand that Martin had to split this book in two and put many characters in the next book. Why, then, did he have to add a bunch of new, unknown, uninteresting minor characters? I didn't know who these characters were and I didn't much care about them. There are already too many characters to keep track of. After four years of waiting, I can't even remember who all the old characters are and what they were doing. Like others, I, too found it tedious to finish this book.Then, after taking four years to get this book out, Martin has the audacity to leave not one, but several, cliffhangers. I guess that's okay. By the time the next book comes out, I probably won't remember them."
5,Loved it!,"The whiners and haters have it all wrong. This book was an excellent addition to the series. I loved it and I can't wait for more! The only possible way to view it in even a slightly negative light is to compare it to the previous books, as Martin is still the best there is. Ok, so the book largely covers only half of the characters of previous books, saving the simultaneous actions of the other characters for the next book, and that means it was slightly less epic. And I never really cared for Cersei that much, and she is covered in great depth in this book. Those are the best I can do for complaints. And then again, I never cared much for the House Greyjoy and the Iron Islanders, but this book really added lots of interest for me, so I expect any future Cersei stories to be quite fasciniating. And thanks to the splitting of the book in half, we shouldn't have to wait quite so long for the next in the series."
2,Disappointing,"If I hadn't loved the first three books in A Song of Ice and Fire so much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed by this installment. I expected to have trouble putting it down like I have with the others. Instead I had trouble picking it up. Finishing it was a chore. The book felt about twice as long as it needed to be and introduced a lot of point-of-view characters you only see once and just don't care about. There are a few interesting plot developments and I'm curious to see where they lead to, but I hope A Dance With Dragons picks up the pace again or else I might be giving up on the series."
2,Where did the plot go?,"I began reading this set of novels after watching HBO season 1 'Game of Thrones'. The idea of a fortified ice wall which kept at bay an evil that isn't really defined was very original in my opinion as was the fantasy world of mainly human characters. The first three books in this series kept my attention because the plot went forward at a slow but steady pace. During this book though, the plot stagnated and many new characters were woven into the story which created way too many threads to maintain my interest since not one of the threads progressed the main plot line introduced in the original novel.I would rate this book a 2 and the series as a whole a 3 with the concept a 5.I am not sure what HBO plans to do with the 'Game of Throne' series because I think all of the good stuff has been used up in season 1. They might get a season 2 out of it if they focus on the War of the 5 Kings, but once they get to the material in this novel...."
2,Brief and to the point.,"I just finished Book Four. I was so disappointed, that I went back to Amazon and read Mr. Fox's review of the book, as well as the reviews by Pawlyszyn and Tom. I agree with all three.I did not like Book Four, I skimmed through much of it, which I rarely do. I was reading this book on my Kindle, and at 90%, the book was over. I didn't find the concluding comments, entitled, ""Meanwhile, Back on the Wall,"" amusing. Mr. Martin wasted my time and lost me as a reader."
2,Lost interest in Book 4,"I agree with many others reviewing this book, and the series as a whole. I was really into the series with the first two books, though I was very angry about the Red Wedding (was the book 2 or 3?) and the knocking out of Robb and Catlyn from the game of thrones. They were wonderful characters that deserved more ink. By the third book I was getting bored with the plot, which seems to have gone very far astray, as has many of the characters, and began to wonder why the author was introducing so many minor characters that add nothing to the original story. Speaking of too many characters, and the lost plot, killing off interesting characters and not speaking of some others only left me wondering what was the point of book 4? I'm almost at the end and feel cheated. I will not bother continuing on. Mr. Martin, I just don't care anymore."
2,Disappointed,I've enjoyed all of the books in the series up to this one. It was boring and lost my interest. I didn't even finish reading it. Hope the next book is better.
4,Not as good...but fills in some gaps...,I love the series! I can hardly wait for the next book! This is a book that concentrates mostly on the workings of a queen gone mad and how all the various schemes and devices she sets in motion are closing in on...her?I rather enjoyed the book even though it didn't present me with what is happening with all my favorite characters. Maybe the next book will surprise me.Get it...and the rest of the series too!
2,Wake me up when something happens,"I have been slogging thru the audiobook version. Even with someone else doing the reading as I drive the daily commute, this is hard work! I keep feeding the discs in to the player, and I am at disc 23 of 26 and still nothing, I mean nothing, has happened. This book is to the first 3 as cardboard is to chocolate mousse cake. George, how can you do this to your fans?"
1,The series has jumped the shark with this release,"This book was a dissapointing failure.I was a huge fan of the previous 3 novels and really anticipated this one. After all the delays and given the long time the author worked on it, it just had to be good, right?Guess not.Many of the strongest characters in the series are not even present. The story line is langid and uninteresting. Minor characters are pushed to the front and we are forced to accompany them on circuitous errands.The overarching series plot, which galloped in the previous three novels, has practically frozen to a standstill. I wish his publisher had burned the thing and told him he needed to start over.It has all the reek of being churned out. Hope the next one saves the series."
1,Very Disappointing,I waited so long for this book and it turned out to be a major disappointment. I really could have done without the gross parts. Is he going to destroy all the good characters? After the first 3 chapters I ended up skimming through the book. Don't waste your money or at least wait until it comes out in paperback. I won't be so quick to be the next book. Truly disappointing. The first 3 books were outstanding. There was so much potential.
2,Shockingly Disappointed,"The First 3 Novels of this series is awesome! That being said, and long wait for the 4 enstallement to grace bookstore retail shelves, this Feast of Crows was a huge disappointment. There was very little story line. Most of the novel was belabored with geneaologies of newly introduced characters that borders on cruelty to the reader. Action? Limited. Favorite characters from the past books in play? Limited or none at all.Intrigue and strategy that was the series trademark - confusing that left one with the sence of hopelessness. Faith alone is the only reason to read this book or perhaps the hope that it would bridge into a 5th book akin to the greatness of the first 3."
2,Another Jordan,"Oh, how I long for the days when a fantasy did not require 15 books to be completed. Remember The Lord of the Rings? It was told in a mere 3 books and had more intellect than all of George Martin's and Robert Jordan's books combined.I'm sorry, George, but I'm afraid I'm going to give up on you much like I gave up on Robert Jordan at Book 10 of the Wheel of Time. I just don't have the patience for 400 page books with a storyline moving at a pace slightly slower than a snail. Get to the point, please!So, for those of you who love(d) Robert Jordan's eternal saga, feel free to join yet another saga that appears to have no end...It had such hope, too. Sigh."
2,What a let down....,"A series that has promised so much with 3 very interesting characters in Tyrion, Jon and Ayra. yet they are hardly mentioned in this 1000 page bore fest. Ayra gets a few chapters but she's used to describe like in the city not for any plot development, whilst Jon and Tyrion aren't even mentioned. Massive, massive let down. I'd have given all of the other three books 5 stars without hesitation, but this...."
2,Not nearly good enough,"The book drags on in a plodding style reminiscent of the later works of Robert Jordan. Many chapters are full of filler material, one small example being the constant need to list the heraldry of every single individual regardless of their importance or relevance to the situation. I found myself skimming through many paragraphs trying to find some pertinent information. 1 star for content, 1 star for previous merit."
3,MARTIN GOING DOWN HILL,"As with most authors, George R. R. Martin is beginning to run out of gas, writing wise. Or purposely churning out dogs to pad his income on this chronology.The book takes you away from the main characters and fills it with dull ones which hold no interest.It also adds new dull characters, on top of the old dull ones.Also too much redundant passages as well.I think HBO is going to have to take some extreme measure in artistic license for this stretch and possibly the next for 'Game of Thrones' to avoid being canceled. It is rumored that the next book will possibly be as bad as this one.Martin is no spring chicken and notorious for slow writing.Will he even be around to finish this saga ? I am hoping for the best and wish he just wrap stuff up instead of stretching out a skunk."
1,down turn,Writers block or just ran out of things to say. Hope this doesn't go the way later Dune series ended up.
2,"2 stars, because my expectations were shattered.","It's not THAT bad. But honestly, how did he think taking away a lot of the best characters would make everyone content for years until he came out with the ADWD (also would have hurt my expectations, if they weren't already obliterated by this book). The worst part of the whole thing is that he went from the best book, to the worst one. The different is so blatant that I got half-way through this one, and was like, seriously? This whole book is based around this? What can anyone say but he's still an excellent author, but he got greedy expanding his trilogy (which would have been amazing and more memorable) into something that's toppling down the hill. I don't know if I'll read 6 . . . Then again, who knows, time heals all wounds.Give me another five years till book 6 comes out, and I might forgive him for his 'slow dance with dragons'."
4,Continuation of an awesome series,"This book is a bit harder to get into than the other ones, so far. I've only read the first 300 pages of the book, but it is taking a bit longer to get extra exciting like the first three were. I've no doubt it will pick up and be just as incredibly awesome as the other ones, but for now there is a lot that has to be said that isn't just as much of a page turner as it's previous books.Still a really good read and i highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy but wants to look for something more than just sword fights and magic. The shift in the narrator at each chapter, despite the fact that it makes it hard to follow each story, enables the author to develop the story a lot more. A truly amazing series"
4,A Feast For Crows,"This novel is different than the previous three; it is much slower paced and new characters of questionable interest are introduced. I do not disagree with the other reviews stating that the novel is too drawn out and does not focus on the primary characters of interest from the previous three novels. But the detail and slower pace was also engaging almost James Joyce'esk in style. I think George RR Martin has shared more of himself in this installment than the previous three novels. So in conclusion this novel is superior to the previous three, and I think it represents a style never presented in any other sci fi/fantasy novel, I listened to the audio book which I think is the preferable format for book IV of the ""Song of Fire and Ice""."
4,ALMOST....not quite.,"Though the book is well written it is not the usual spell binding excellence that one would attribute to G.R.R.M. The characters in this book no longer fit the mold that I had made from the previous novels. Do I now like Jamie...How did Cersei get so crazy, and who are all of these new people?I think one of the reasons I enjoy the author so much is because of the unpredictability of the main characters. Will the good guy win, or will he or she survive for that matter.But it begs the question: After removing/killing most of the heros from the previous books can Martin build new characters that are just as lovable as the original Stark Family? I hope so I love this series.Also to Bantam Publishing please hire George an editor. Or if Mr. Martin has one please make sure he uses him or her. Thanks"
2,Just so.,"Martin uses this phrase aptly in Feast for Crows, and I can't claim to do it justice in the title of this review. His writing is the same quality & fun it's always been, and [most of] the characters are still rich and believable. Nevertheless, Feast is good writing, not a great novel. It contains detail that is neither enjoyable to read nor relevant to the main line- except perhaps forcibly so. Rather than tying things together, the story needlessly grows broader and more complex. I repeat a sentiment echoed in other reviews that perhaps the ""original"" plan was better. Editing 1500 pages- or 2500- into 800 pages of an exclamatory continuation of the first three volumes might have yielded a better read than two separately cluttered volumes. I could ease up a little by looking at Feast as part 1 of volume 4, and part 2 is of course not out yet. Perhaps A Dance With Dragons will help redeem Feast, but each of the first three stood on their own. Unfortunately, number four does not."
3,Rating would be higher if previous books weren't so strong.,"If this was really one book split in two then the next book should be fantastic as all the characters and plots I really didn't care for were shoved into this book. It's still a good book compared to most of the other fiction out there, but compared to the first three it is really weak.As far as the publisher being reluctant to put out a 1500 page book to accomodate the stories, I think that is ridiculous. How many people who have read the first three books would drop the series if book 4 was that long? Probably not as many as are conisdering dropping it after this book.However I would not let this book alone prevent someone from reading the series. Especially if the next book gets back on track. If you are considering reading the series you may want to wait until the 5th book is closer to being published as you could then hopefully jump right from this book into that one and maybe book 4 won't seem as bad."
3,A Feast For The Impatient,"A lot of filler and time wasting, but essential to the plot, I guess. You can't go skipping books in a series and expect to know what's going on. A little lighter on he explicit sex scenes (gracias a dios). What can you say? It's a subjective and personal work and you take it as is or leave it. It doesn't mean you have to like it 100%."
2,The best is yet to come.,"The GoodThe grit of the setting and GRRMs writing style is entertainingThe BadThe series itself is on a rollercoaster Book 1 simply superb, book 2 slow a little boring but setting things up, book 3 one of the best books ever once things where set in motion they just wouldn't stop. Book 4 disappointing, bad way to split it and slow which will likely set up book 5 to be good. So he can end the series with a bang I hope the series goes to eight books.The UglyThe Cover, how did this go so wrong. Don't Judge a book by its cover...worst cover...worst book ...hmmm.Splitting the book, ok he gambled and IMO it failed hard core, he would have been way better off to release a 2500 page monster (and charge much more or release two books Feast I and Feast II simultaneously).The audio tapes, why did they get another reader?"
3,scattered....,"Okay, its been about a year since I read the book, so my apologies for that. However I do distinctly remember being disappointed in ""Feast for Crows"". I was hoping that Martin would be using this installment to try to bring things together and bring at least *some* closure to things. Instead, the plot branched out even more than ever before.My fear is that what started as one of the best series I have ever picked up will end up like Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series (11 books, and who knows if the 12th will post-humuosly tie things up). This is a potential problem with all ""epic"" fiction, unfortunately. It's a real shame in this instance because Martin writes the best ""bad guys"" ever - I love the fact that he can make me love the Imp, Jamie, Stannis & Renly as well as the ""good guys"" (the Stark kids, Daenerys).Hope he is able to bring things back on track before the series loses too much focus."
1,Horrid!,I could not put down the first 3 books. I can not get myself to pick up this book again. Terrible writing. Geroge R. R. Martin should be ashamed of himself. This series died a very sad pathetic death with this book.I would give this book less than one star if I could.
2,Does GRRM care how angry readers are getting?,"A Feast for Crows was a huge disappointment to almost everyone. GRRM new it was a pretty poor effort and he offered some weak explanations in his web site - the entire work was too long for one volume, Dances with Dragons was coming soon, he had writer's block, he had to go to this convention and that convention, yadda, yadda, yadda....... I'm pretty angry that GRRM, whom we all thought would fill the void created when Robert Jordan turned into a literary prima donna, seems so dismissive of readers' frustration with the time between books and the short comings of Feast For Crows. Is there any point in my or other readers getting angry? Probably not. GRRM will finish Dances With Dragons in his own good time, and readers will buy it as quickly as drug addicts going through withdrawal. If Dances With Dragons does not get the series back on track I'm finished with it. I won't get sucked into another Wheel Of Time morass."
1,Can't even finish it.,"This book literally made me angry. While reading the book, at first I kept thinking that maybe the next chapter would be about a character I actually cared about, but then I got about 500 pages into it when I had to come on Amazon and read the reviews to see if the book ever gets any better. Basically all the reviews are right. Every character and storyline you care about is almost completely ignored or not even covered.I guess the good news is maybe HBO can actually do something with the story. I won't be reading any more of this series."
3,Disappointing after waiting for five years!,"First, let me confess that I am a huge fan of this series and I think the creativity, complexity of characters and intriguing plots makes this one of the two or three finest series in this genre. That being said, shame on you Mr. Martin. Feast could have been written in 6 months. It's a transitionary novel and not much happens. All the other reviews here are correct:- Not much happens- Lots of wandering around- Poor choice of which character POVs to includeOverall, much ado about nothing. I don't know whether this poorly edited beast is the fault of an author who has gotten lazy and has stopped striving or whether the blame falls at the feet of a greedy publishing house who wanted to cut one story into two in order to sell more books. Either way, I am sorely disappointed and will not have to wait with baited breath for the next book.Very disappointed fan."
2,I Fear Martin will follow Robert Jordan into the FORGOTTEN Realm,"So....after waiting what seemed like FOREVER (something I did with Mr. Jordan) for the next installment. I run buy it the day of release. Low and behold I find myself able to sleep while reading AGAIN! You know like a movie you can leave for 20 minutes and don't have to pause because you know you won't miss anything. I find myself wondering why I even read the book, so I read it again. Still nothing happened. Here is an author that had me hooked by the second page of each of his last three books. He has taken the.... hmmmm.... say...least interesting of the characters and made us follow the same old hum drum of their lives for what seems like forever. Sorry I am VERY disappointed and have put my collection on ebay just like I did with Jordan. I will borrow a copy of any future books from a friend before I spend any more money on George R. R. Martin. Please redeem yourself Mr. Martin."
2,hoodwinked,"If you really like this series and have just finished book one or two, stop now - and savor the best that Martin had to offer. Feast for Crows was not only disappointing, but disingenuous. Without revealing story line, I can say that the author has chosen a path for the continuation of this story that appears designed to sell more books, but not to satisfy his readers. Shame. At the end of four books, I have a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Bring back Roy Dotrice!,"For those of you who think there isn't enough about your favorite characters in this book, read his explanation. You'll get more of what you want in the next volume.I'm very happy with the writing, and would have given this 5 stars if Roy Dotrice had been reading it. I can't believe they chose to release this with a new narrator. Roy Dotrice is a much better narrator for this series, and after listening to the first three novels (hours and hours!) his voice has become the characters to me. I just can't make the adjustment to John Lee.Random House, if you're listening, please re-release this (unabridged - as always) with Roy Dotrice reading. I'd rather have a delay in the release of future books than lose Roy Dotrice."
1,Without Roy Dotrice its just not the same :(,The absolute worst thing audio books can do is change a good narrator in the middle of a series. I loved the first 3 books and Roy Dotrice was Great. I wish I knew why they changed narrators in mid series. That totally sucks!! I don't have time to read the books and depend totally on audio books. When it happened in Stephen King's Dark Tower series at least King explains that the original narrator was in a serious accident and could no longer narrate. So what is the reason Mr. Dotrice did not do book 4. I hope it is a good reason because I am very disappointed.
2,What the...?,"I am hugely upset that Martin's work seems to be going in the same direction as Robert Jordan's self indulgent meanderings. I could not have enjoyed the first three books any more. I read each three times and I was as excited about ""A Feast for Crows"" as I have ever been for any series-type novel. This book was really tough to get through and would have been next to impossible to finish if I had not enjoyed the previous books so much and was not so hungry to see what was going to happen next. I will certainly read Martin's next installment but it's going to have knock my head off to make me want to read any more after that."
1,"This book sucks, George.","It's as if George R.R. Martin had an intern write this book for him.I absolutely hate this installement! I am so totally dissapointed. This is only magnified by my love of the first three books, which I consider masterpieces. If all the characters in this book collectively walked off a cliff, never to be heard from again, I would be happy. And if the author follows this up with something equally mediocre then he can do the same thing (along with George Lucas)."
2,A long and tedious read.,"This whole Game of Thrones series could have been edited into one book. Book four is the worst, causing me to skim through most of it. This book series is like a movie with a cast of thousands, each with a speaking part. Many obscure characters with unpronounceable and forgettable names show up maybe once or twice hundreds of pages apart. There is a ton of mundane filler in these books, especially book four. I blame the editor as there is a good story buried under the abundance of superfluous text."
2,A Feast for Crows,"Way too long winded, too many characters, couldn't keep up. For History buffs they might enjoy."
1,A mystical All My Children & General Hospital in the making,"Who said in the mystical distant land, they don't have All My Children & General Hospital series? I have had a feeling that the stories keep going on & on after reading book 2 and yes, book 3 has indeed confirmed my nagging feeling. But I tried to finish it to see if there is any closure on Book 4. Well, about 100 pages into book 4, I have to put down to search in internet to see if King Martin has some plans for other books. Yep, he did plan to have book 7. For now.Book 4 is a totally waste of time leading to another waste of time and then to another waste of time, to infinity if King Martin's health permits. The series should close around book 3 and at worse book 4. But King Martin keeps go on & on with his very ""inventive"" & petty plots and many plots really do insult reader intelligence. But I have to tip my hat as King Martin is the best in milking cows by stuffing his books with junks. See you at book 100."
3,More of the same,"Similar to the first three. Perhaps he has a plan, but I have a feeling that this series could easily have been condensed into 3 or possibly 4 books. But I guess more books = more money. I've read the first books in quick succession. But, I think I need a bit of a break - will probably come back to it once I've heard that the final book has been written."
2,I am just hard to convince,"Even after reading all the reviews...I went ahead and bought this compilation of outtakes.... as that what it seems to be to me. Boring to the max. The author should be ashamed...reminds me of Frank herbert's son and the Dune series...should not have been published. Searching Google, I found out there are websites to download this book (and the next) in a pdf format...for free. Glad I did. The next book, A Dance with Dragons, stinks worse than this one...and they want $14.99 for it! Save your hard earned money folks and believe these reviews,"
2,Great Book - Needs Roy Dotrice as narrator.,"This is a great book. However, there is one significant problem....No Roy Dotrice! John Lee narrates this installation of George R. R. Martin's ""A song of Ice and Fire"" series with talent, but not the talent that could have been offered by Roy Dotrice, the narrator of the last three installments. Consider petition Random House for another publication with Dotrice as the voice. Go to petitiononline.com/4Dotrice/petition.html to let your voice be heard."
1,just awful,"I looked forward to this book with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed. None of the characters (with the possible exception of Samwise) are worth ""rooting"" for. The ones like Breanna who seem to have some integrity are killed off. It might be just like real life, but I read fantasy for fun, not existential philosophy. I really doubt I will buy the next one."
2,Sloppy Writing,"I have one short comment. I hope Mr. Martin never uses the phrase, ""half a hundred"" again. Why he used it so often in this book is beyond me, but I'm afraid it represents a certain laziness on the part of both author and editor. This is not a petty concern; it represents a summary of other sloppy writing practices evident in the book. With such an interesting plot and characters, the writing should not be lazy.With respect,"
3,Love Mr. Martin but,I loved the first three in the series. All I will say about this one is...way too many characters to keep up with...
2,Made for TV Movie?,"I really hate to say this but I think that this book was written for a TV series. How else does it make sense that it is so lame? It really does read like a soap-operaand I am sad that such a promising series is whimpering out. Slogging through pages and pages to get to the meat of the matter is not fun.When I find myself ""speed-reading"" instead of ""re-reading"" chapters I know something has gone amiss with the author.In spite of the (what one review called sadistic)awful treatment the most likeable characters get I was entrenched in finding out the history of this fantasy world.Now I feel meh....why bother....I will just be disappointed. Read if you must."
3,A hit and a miss,"I, as many other fans of GRRM, loved the first three books. Unfortunately, AFFC did not consistently deliver as the previous novels. I enjoyed parts of the book when the action picked up, but these events were too far amd few between.After reading the reviews for DANCE, I am leary of reading it since it sounds like more of of the same. Darn."
2,This feast will leave you hungry ... in a bad way ....,"With each release in the series up until this point, Mr. Martin seemed to up the ante on quality, excitement, pacing, and plotting. In contrast to the magic growing throughout Westeros, Martin seems to have lost the magic touch with this entry. Points of view are added that seem to bear very little importance to the overall story. Even worse, they plod along drearily.Most of the viewpoints we've come to love don't even appear in this novel. Which would be fine, if of course, what was in their place felt as if it had a point. Being interesting to read would also be a bonus. Ultimately this novel failed me more than it succeeded."
3,Change the reader .. Please!,"I have been absolutely engrossed in this series since first being introduced. The writing and storylines are suberp but as an avid ""listener"" much of the enjoyment came from Roy Dotrice's narrating. What a huge disappointment this time. I do not know what prompted the change but John Lee is just wrong for this series. I realise when a new voice comes along they have to make it their own but he has just made it dreary. He has managed to make the characters flat and one dimensional.Whereas Roy Dotrice made them come alive he has killed them. I hope that the publishers, or who ever makes these decisions will correct it with the next edition or I may just have to give up on this series altogether"
3,Half a story-half as good,"Introduces a lot of new persons, does not follow through on story line or original promises. Like the great race car drivers, who can win with a car that should not even show! so too the master story teller can ""beat the odds"" and produce a GOOD story from one that should not even show. Still, it is pure pleasure to watch and read the ""music of master with vehicle to match."""
4,A Feast for Crows,"Liked very much, although missed some of the other story lines & characters. A bit sloggy at times & then ripping at others. Engrossing storytelling."
3,Disappointing,Just highly disappointed. A momentum was lost and the boo dragged. It felt like nothing happened. At least nothing that couldn't have been summarized with a few pages or maybe a chapter. I hope the next book regains momentum. I can only imagine having to wait five years for this book and then another five or six years for book five....I might've killed myself.
3,Nothing to Crow About,"This is more a review of the whole ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series. Started with a bang. Loved ""A Game of Thrones"" when I read it as a preview of the upcoming HBO series. Liked ""A Clash of Kings"" and ""A Storm of Swords."" And, I was looking forward to ""A Feast for Crows."" First, I can imagine how readers waiting for the next volume of the series felt; the ending of ""A Feast for Crows"" was akin to being put into suspended animation for the past five years. But, that's not my real problem. During ""A Feast for Crows,"" I just got bored. It's sometimes like a medieval fantasy ""Perils of Pauline"" for the major characters; and a lot of clutter with the many new minor characters in each succeeding book. Still looking forward to the HBO series (love watching Sean Bean act); but, if it ever comes out, I might take a pass on Martin's next book."
3,A Review for the Audiobook,"I really enjoy the series George R.R. Martin creates a twisting tale of deception, that keeps you reading, or in this case listening. The previous three books had Roy Dotrice as the Narrator, and he did an extremely good job, with different voices for each character. For some reason however, Martin used a new Narrator for this book, John Lee. The pronunciation of words sometimes is a bit overdone, and almost all of the characters are indistinguishable from each other.Why fix something that is not broken Mr. Martin?"
2,Not the best.,"This book was a chore to read through. The style of transitioning between characters just as one character's story is getting exciting which was used effectively in the first three books is annoying in this book. This book develops the story of many of what may be considered ""lesser"" characters. It left me with the feeling that I could have not read it and been fine. All those pages could have been summed up in a few sentences."
3,Missing far too much to be great,"I spent most of this book waiting for something to happen, waiting to spend time with the characters I expected to see. It was only after becomming disappointed that I read on the author's website that this is 1/2 of the original planned book split into two for size's sake.Okay, that is part of an explanation, but does not really satisfy. That means the next book will not contain any follow through from this one and these story lines will be dangling for several years before being picked up. Worse people who don't know go into this book set for disappointment as they expected to see their favorite characters and were met with a book of new characters and nothing to tell them.I hope the time between book 4 and book 6 is far less than book 1->4, because spending this much time away from ciritical characters is a sure way to lose interest in a series."
2,"Holy Jebus, my brain hurts...","After endless hours of reading through five or so characters I actually want to read about, or even CARE about, I finally get back to one I do. Needless to say, this required diligence and a patience I normally don't possess, and a bottle of excedrin.Mr. Martin could've made this story phenominal if he'd just stuck to the characters the first book started with, the Starks. This latest installment bored me to tears, to be honest, and I really reaaaaally don't care to read about Circe. Her chapters were predictable to the point where I'd find myself laughing about how she's just 'another bad guy.' In fact the vast majority of the book could have just been over-written with chapters all about the Starks, with maybe a few about other big players in the story.I'm begging of you, Martin, please for the love of Pete, stick to the interesting stuff, or I'm going to need a stronger pain reliever to sit through the next one!"
2,Incomprehensible,I read and enjoyed the previous three books in this series although the first book was the best of the three. I gave up on A Feast of Crows about a third of the way through. All the likeable characters were killed off in the prior books. I think it's been three years since the last book and I don't remember that much about the surviving characters. The book should have at least had an introduction to refresh the reader as to what had happened in the prior books re-introduce the characters.
2,end of the road,I loved the first three - this one gave me visions of Robert Jordan's neverending Wheel of Time series. I just don't have the patience for the bloated plot and indulgence in minor characters.
2,What can we expect??,"Okay, what do we expect when an author has killed off, or tried to kill off, most of his major characters? Then he gets a major case of writer's block for HOW many years???!! Yes, a sub-par effort. He's trying to dig himself out of the hole he created. I really enjoyed the first 3 books - a fantastic effort. I hoped that Martin wasn't turning into another Robert Jordan (won't waste my time anymore with anything he writes - hundreds of pages where absolutely nothing happens), but seems like I won't get my wish."
2,Also disappointed,"I am listening to the audio version of this book. With the previous volumes, I have been enthralled; this one feels like a chore to get through. So many of my favorite characters have been killed off in the first three volumes, and this book focuses on so many characters that I care nothing about.I read the info that this volume is more of a preamble to the next installment, but I like to read books that have some redeeming content of their own."
1,Not the best,"The story could be just as good without all the filler. Too many begat who begat who begat. Who can remember it all? This book is not as good as the other three. I will not even start book 5. I too believe GRRM is bored with this long long epic and cant come up ending except ,maybe letting the Others kill off everyone that's left. (I love my Kindle Fire)"
2,this book needed much more editing,"Martin is a great writer. I loved the first and second books, the third less so and this even less.There are too way many characters. Once the books took off like Wildfire, it seems the editor got lazy and just him run amok and everything passed muster. Way too many scenes that don't progress the story. Too many repetitive battles and jousting for power. A book, even ones this size, shouldn't need to list 80 pages of explanatory houses/characters at the end of each book."
4,A great follow up to Storm of Swords,"To write a continuation for Storm of Swords isn't easy, because it is an astonishing book.But George Martin made it with honors.Although I didn't like the idea of splitting the stories in two books, I liked that George Martin didn't include new points of view.And Cersey's cliffhanger was fantastic."
3,A Feast of Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four,"This book does not have as much action as volumes 1 thru 3; but it is still a good read. Martin has a marvelous, easy-to-read writing style that keeps me coming back for more."
2,get on with it already,This was certainly my least favorite book. Martin obviously doesn't know how to edit himself. He seems to feel the need to fully develop every thought or idea that comes into his head. He is an incredible writer but certainly has a problem with resolve. This book is soley focused on what i think are the less interesting characters. I would either skip this book or skim through it as much as possible. The fifth book is so much better! I can not wait for the next book. Martin better hold true to his word and finish this series in seven books.
5,Great,Great book... can't wait to read the next one. Start off fast and ends even faster. Wasn't wanting it to end.
3,I feel like I have been bombarded with words,"I remain a big fan but my loyalty and my endurance were severally tested reading books 4 & 5. Too many peripheral characters...a reader would have to keep genealogy notes to keep all of them straight in ones mind. The story simply got lost in the deluge of secondary characters & descriptions.George Martin brought the main characters to life in the first four books but in the last two, the main characters I have grown to appreciate became footnotes. When the main characters did appear, they were ineffectual and had very little influence in moving the story along.To give Martin the benefit of the doubt, I re-read books 4 & 5 (I must be a masochist...) I came away every bit as confused and disappointed as the first reading left me.I can only hope that the next installment of Game Of Thrones somehow ties all of these characters and sub-plots together in a way I can understand. Reading good fiction and fantasy should not be a penance a reader must endure."
4,The lease of the series but still great,This one focuses too much on Cercie and the Maiden of Quarth Brie. The Dornish story is good addition and at first the Ironmen are annoying but starts wrapping things together. But only about 5 chapters into the Dance with Dragons and it is worth powering through this one.
2,I feel like I've been suckered,"Thanks for sucking me in with three very engaging and interesting books: only in the fourth to ignore more than half of the characters that were the focus of those books!I feel like I've been strung along with multiple new characters that I don't have the energy for, even if they did have more than 1 or 2 chapters to develop, while getting very little meaningful story in return!"
4,It's a good read.,I just started reading this book but I like it already. I have loved the earlier books and can't wait to get into this one more.
2,A bit of a let down,"After reading the first three books of the series, feast was a bit of a let down. The point of view characters' stories did not really connect to each other. There was no mention of the wall or dany, which was disappointing. I did enjoy arts and Brown's story lines. Jamie's story felt incomplete."
2,SLEEPING Pill,"To many characters , very drawn out. I was bored for the most part of this book. I invested this much into the story let's see how it ends.."
4,A snack of a book in the feast that is A Song of Ice and Fire,"Not the strongest book in the series, as it follows mostly secondary characters and plot lines. It does, however, set up nicely for the real action coming up (Martin even has a apology of sorts in the back explaining this). I am stoked to read the next book."
2,uhoh,"Im not certain what mr. martin was thinking, book 3 was a real page turner but ""A feast of crows"" tends to go off the story as a whole and disappointed me."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the first three books I was disappointed by how this book barely moves the main story forward. The characters that kept me wanting to read more--Tyrion, Arya, Bran, Stannis, Jon--are barely mentioned. The writer knew many of his fans would feel let down, as indicated in his epilogue. One thing I did enjoy was seeing the other side of Jaime, who became one of my favorite characters. But, as far as I'm concerned, most of the book is a self-indulging dragging out of the story and a grating tease. I'm holding off before committing to book 5."
4,Interesting read...not the best of the series though,"Love the series so this was a must-read. It tied some things together, left more doors open and raised some curious questions...cannot wait to read the next!"
2,Slow. Robert Jordan-esque,"I am really afraid of the next book. A Feast for Crows was really slow and disappointing . It got bogged down in minor detail while glossing over the more interesting aspects of the story (The Mountain, The Hound) nonwithstanding George's statement that he focused on some characters more than others on purpose. I think he made a mistake. The beauty of the series so far was the fact that we saw the events played out through several points of view at the time - that is the whole crux of the Song Of Ice and Fire. All that changed with A Feast For Crows. I am very nervous that the series will descend into a tragical, neverending farce that Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time has become. I woved not to read any more of Robert Jordan's dross beyond Crossroads of Twilight. I am worried that I may have to make the same decision about George RR Martin after this book. I hope that the next book brings us more of what got all of us hooked on his work in the first place."
1,What a huge DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"First 3 books are excellent. This is one disappointing, lame excuse for a 4th book. Read the other reviews. I have nothing to add. They are correct. Most of the characters and story lines in the other books have been abandoned. Did he forget what he wrote in the 3rd book? The authors even adds a last page trying to justify why this 4th book is not as good as the other 3- lets you know he knows it was a stinker!"
1,Complete waste of time,"I can't believe what a waste of time this book was, and I was shocked to find out that the 5th installment has been delayed for years (the pre-order fooled me), but it's also just the other points of view during the same time period? Then why the delay?This installment was deadly boring and repetitive. I couldn't have cared less about the new characters. I couldn't even keep them straight. It just went nowhere, but the whole time I figured at least the story line would wrap up with the next book, one way or another. When I got to the final chapter, I almost threw my kindle across the room.Will I buy the next book? Not unless I see a whole heck of a lot of positive reviews saying that he redeemed himself (or his editor, rather) and that it is the final installment that wraps everything up. I am not going to slog through another 1,000 pages and then another and another."
2,Pretty Slow,"Book 4 is mostly about smaller characters and for chapters you are wondering what is happening to Arya, Jon and Tyrion. I justed wanted to get through it to get on to book 5!"
3,extremely slow,While the Game of Thrones series has been my all time favorite read this book is extremely slow and unnecessary to the series. It spends most of its time focused on Cersei losing her grasp on reality and the kingdom she so desperately wants to rule. Some of the series most important characters don't even show up in this book. Unfortunately if you are reading the entire series you have to sit and force.yourself to read this book. If you are not reading the entire series do not waste your money on it.
3,tough read,"I breezed through the first three books in about 2 months. However, this fourth book is boring! I'm halfway through the book and just don't feel like reading it anymore. I'll have to push myself to finish it but honestly, the author wrote a dud with this book. I truly hope the second half picks up the pace and Dance with Dragons better be worth it!"
1,fell off the track,"This is a prime example of lazy writing and zero editing. I don't mean grammar editing - I mean, ""Dude, don't change the rules. And spend pages describing inane, irrelevant places and details. And introduce new characters that nobody cares about, while leaving good characters without a mention. Don't do that. Your audience might follow you down these silly sidetracks, but they won't be happy about it."" This series looks like it will become another Wheel of Time - on and on and on and on . . ."
2,Not real happy with this volume,"The first three volumes of this series are absolutely great. Fantastic reads in all of them. Talked to my son and learned this series is one of his favorite. However, I find volume four less than acceptable for this writer as I'm sure I will if I read the fifth in the series. I'm finishing number 4 just because I want to finish it, but looking forward to my next book whatever it might be.So, all in all the first three are splendid and definitely worth the time from cover to cover."
2,The story did not go anywhere.,Too many of the main characters (and there are many) seem to be on an endless journary to nowhere. Very disappointed an end to the tale is not forthcoming. I liked the first three books - the story moved along fairly well inspite of Martin's excessive descriptive writing technique. A lot of what Martin writes does nothing to advance the story. I do not think I will spend the time and money reading the fifth book.
3,A frustrating speed bump in the series,"Coming off of A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows is simply disappointing. Many of the core characters are not included in this book. While Martin introduces chapters from the point of view of characters such as Brienne of Tarth and Queen Cersei - certainly interesting characters to get to know better - he omits favorites such as Tyrion and Daenerys Targaryen. There also seems to be a lot of history of Westeros and flashbacks of characters - which slow the stories down immensely. That being said, I still devoured the book in less than a week."
4,Great,The story kept me from putting it down it was my second favorite in the series so far can't wait for the next book
2,"Sorry, this book is horrible.","After reading the first three books in the series and loving pretty much every page, A Feast for Crows was a horrible disappointment. Others have already said it better, but plot-wise, almost nothing happens in this book. Oh, you will learn about characters and more characters and the back history of their houses, but nothing interesting actually happens here. I cannot tell you how many times I fell asleep while reading it.To add insult to injury, several of your favorite and infamous characters from Book 1-3 don't even make an appearance. It's hard to imagine what Martin was thinking here.God help HBO if they try to make this boring book into a 13 episode season. ONE, MAYBE TWO episodes will suffice."
3,Did Martin take a break?,"I was a little disappointed with this book as not all of the usual cast of characters were in this. There were no POVs from Jon Snow or Dany Targaryen. It was mostly focused on Cersei and her political machinations as Queen Regent and Arya being inducted into the Faceless Men. Martin also introduces a brand new cast of characters of the Martells and the Sand Snakes.I felt this book was very complicated with the new addition of the Martells. More and more players are being introduced and it becoming hard to keep track of everyone.Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the books despite missing Jon and Dany."
3,reader not so great,"IMHO, this book's reader, John Lee, is not nearly as good as his predecessor Roy Dotrice.My main issue with Mr. Lee's flowery reading makes his characterizations come across as grossly over-acted. It makes it hard to listen to.Roy's reading seemed to fit with the gritty storytelling much better.--Furry cows moo and decompress."
3,Needs to be prefaced...,"Not my favorite of the series, however it must be read since its part of the series. There were a couple of good twists, but it is missing lots of main characters. The author explains that at the end of the book, which should have been at the front of the book. Overall, definitely not a regretful read. Now...on to book 5!!! Can't wait!"
3,And the crows eat well....,"And the crows eat well....because this book was almost dead for me.As this fourth entry to the Song of Fire and Ice series begins I immediately like it more than its predecessor. We are taken through some life changing actions for some of the familiar characters while being introduced to still more. This is definitely a series that needs to be read in order to get the full scope of this epic dramatic fantasy. However while just desserts are served here I found myself missing my favorite characters a lot. That ""miss-age"" is possibly one of the reasons the book seemed to drag for me and led me to the sin of skimming in places. It also strong resembled a newer foundation being laid over the old one to continue with the series.Unfortunately, I am losing my fascination with this series, a feeling I didn't think I'd ever have when I started out but am becoming increasingly uncertain if I can drum up any interest in the meanderings with so many new characters."
5,Hooked,I am hooked on the whole series. This book had a lot of strong character development -I see their hearts.
4,A Feast for Crows,Great addition to the story and world of Martin. If it had my favorite characters (that aren't dead anyway) it would have been 5 stars.
2,The Beginning of the End?,"I finished reading all the books published so far. When I finished this one, I was not very happy with it but I had hopes it would be salvaged by A Dance with Dragons. In a way, it is. This book was a little slow for me and wasn't very entertaining but when compared with Dance with Dragons (the next book in the series) this one is like War and Peace.All I can say is that, looking back, I wish I had stopped at the end of Storm of Swords. I don't think Martin is going to finish the series and given how the series is not very good anymore, maybe that is for the best."
2,Reviewing John Lee,"John Lee is the guy who reads the book for the audiobook version. Up to now I have only heard Roy Dotrice, so it's entirely possible I just got used to Mr. Dotrice, but John Lee grates on my ear like crazy - I could not listen to him for even one chapter. All the stresses sounded wrong and the voices were completely different. It just lost something. Again, I don't know if it's just the shift from what I'm used to, but I would advise going with Mr. Dotrice as opposed to Mr. Lee."
3,I'm starting to get bored,"I REALLY love the first three books. They kept me wanting more and I even got headaches because I couldn't just stop reading.But this 4th book kind of bored me. Why, i ask, keep adding characters? Do I want to know about more people, still? I am sure that it all has a purpose at the end but I chose to read the end without having to read Brienne's perils and those new stories he added.I pretty much just want to know what happens to the original characters without having to read through new ones. That said, it looks like we will know the end of the series by the year 3000.Anyway, I'm waiting for the price of the 5th book to go down to buy it and am ready to skip pages like crazy...."
3,Loosing Steam,I'll keep this review terse (unlike the book).1. I could not put down the first three books and often lost many hours of sleep staying up late at night to keep going.2. This book is the opposite. I am having a hard time reading it and loose more steam every hour. I'm not even sure if I'll make it to the end as the new characters and plots don't hold much interest for me and the remaining portion is lagging as well.I hope book 5 is better than this...bah!
5,Awesome,"Great character writing, you begin to even see these characters as real individuals. Complex and very political world. The books are truly about the game of thrones, no character is safe and can die anytime."
4,Still well worth it.,I'll admit that unlike the first three books I was tempted to skip ahead to chapters that were focused on characters I enjoyed more but I still thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. It had enough unexpected twists to keep me captivated. I especially enjoyed the developments with Arya Stark. It also left us with some major cliffhangers which will hopefully be touched upon in the next book even though I understand it will be focusing primarily on other characters.
4,I enjoyed the change of pace,"Some of the new characters were an extremely nice change of pace: Cersei and Jamie were probably among my favorite. I am enjoying the evolution of Jamie and Arya. Sansa seems to be coming into her own, and beginning to understand how to play the game of thrones.All in all, this books pace is slightly slower than the previous books, there are more characters to worry about, and some pointless ones. But it provides and interesting view of the world from characters we haven't previously heard from.On a side note. I very much dislike all the Brienne chapters, and her character."
4,Good series,"The first book was the best in the series, but all the books were entertaining and hard to put down. I didn't like some of the things in this book but will still recommend especially after reading the first three."
2,Filler,This entire book felt like filler between ASOS and whatever was SUPPOSED to come next in the series. Unlike ASOS and ACOK this book is unnecessarily long. It could have easily been cut in half.If I had read this book after a 5 year wait from ASOS I would have been severely disappointed. Luckily I'm reading books 1-4 over 8 months.
3,A Feast for Crows,"Was so looking forward to reading this, after the first three. Can't say I was disappointed, but was not pleased with the results. What happened to Robb making Jon his heir and now Jon is Lord Commander? Didn't catch that one, oh well. Bring on number 5 and my girl Dany! Hope the Imp is back as well and repaying his Lannister debts! (Liking the HBO series, not to shabby.)"
3,Huge disappointment,I spent weeks reading the first three books and grew to know the characters. Then in Book 4 the world is turned upside down with new charater perspectives and no continuity with the others. I was irked the entire way through the 4th Book and skimmed most of it to find traces of the former characters.
2,Audio book version - bring back Roy D.,"Oh wow, what a disappointment when starting Feast For Crows and not hearing Roy Dotrice's voice. After listening for so many hours (audio book 1-3) to his rich skilled voice, emerging me into the world of Westeros....this new narrator is like black is to white. What a let down. As other posters have said, I too am going to just read the book. I can not suffer hours of this guy's droning."
2,Anticlimatic after the 3rd one.,"This book is very anticlimatic compared to the happenings in the third one. Very slow paced, we read about a bunch of new characters (too much character development) and almost nothing about the usual ones (i.e. no Jon Snow, Daenerys, Bran..)"
2,A Feast For Crows,"Needs editing. Dragged on. Were it not for my enjoyment of the previous three books I would have put this book down. The writer's style is still apparent, but his interest is not.A Feast for Crows 1st (first) edition Text Only"
3,"Wait for the TV series, it'll be completed well before the books","Mr. Martin's nickname in high school was Rail Road. I think those who teased him were somehow foreshadowing the future, using one of the slower forms of transportation to forewarn fans of his writing of the snail-crawl of his penmanship. Until Rail Road becomes a magnet train I would discourage anyone who has yet to begin reading this series from doing so. Unless you have a super-human memory, you'll be rereading the previous volumes again and again just as a refresher every eight to ten years between each books release. Winter may be coming, but my children's children should be well prepared by then."
3,"lots of character, little accomplishment","I've enjoyed this series to-date and waited for this latest edition seemingly forever. It doesn't take Martin long to get you thrown back in to his world of mayhem and intrigue. A long time passed between my reading of the previous book and this one, so the murder which takes place in the early pages was an unsettling reminder of the brutality of the not unrealistic existence the author has created.The character development continues to be a strength of this series, but that's where I hit my issue with this book. It seemed to be all character development (700 pages worth) and very little in the way of anything substantial actually happening. I sincerely hope that part two of this book, featuring the other half of the character base, provides a bit more in that regard. I really don't like the idea of having to wait until book six, whenever that might come out, before the grand story starts moving once more."
2,Famine for the Hungry,"For a reader that feasted hungerly on the first three novels, I was left ill and weakened by the bloated lack of substance of this novel. Shame on George Martin. Woe to all that thirst for the greatness of the original three. Will we once again be fed words worthy of a King or are we Crows that must feast on what Scraps we are given.From what I hear of the next novel, it is the latter.I feel Martin has lost the entrance to the world and looks in from a distance. I hope he finds his way back again, with help if necessary."
2,This Series is about 3000 words too long,I appreciate an author creating a world in which his reader can get lost. But you don't expect to lose the storyline in the process! Reading these books is like eating a 7 course meal and being left hungry. Get on with the story already.
2,Very disappointed,"Read this right after part 3 in hope of resurrection for the saga. I must concur with most of the fans that this is a loser and the story has gotten too rambling as opposed to the earlier character driven adventure and politesse. I read all that bollocks blaming publishers and etc., but the content is what did this one in. I won't be reading book 5 unless there's thunderous reviews and much talk of having resurrected the drama of the first two installments. I found myself forgetting who some characters were, since they weren't interesting anyway. Perhaps too many?I watched part one of the mini-series based on Game of Thrones this past week, and it was awesome. What a bloody grim world the cinematography portrayed, just like the story was lifted from the written word, as I had pictured it in my mind."
1,Big Time Boring,This has to be one of the most boring books of all time. I enjoyed books 1-3 and listened to them on Unabridged CD's. The publisher even had the guts to use a new narrator(John Lee) instead of Roy Dotrice who had narrated the first 3 volumes. Mr. Dotrice is the best creator of interesting voices after Harry Potter's Jim Dale. Maybe Mr. Dotrice tried to read the book and told them No Thanks. First a trilogy and now a projected 7 book story arc. Bring back Roy Dotrice for the rest of the books.
1,What a let down,"I absolutely loved the first three books. They were well-written, and the stories were facinating and intriguing. I couldn''t put the books down. This book, however, was basically a waste of time. Reading it was an absolute chore - -something I did because I already has so much emotional capital invested in the story. This book moved the story not an inch. I don't know who to blame, the author or the editors; but I believe the editors at fault. The book is still well written, but Mr. Martin has gone down the path of Robert Jordan, a series I gave up on a long time ago. I hope the next book restores the luster to a series that is now tainted."
1,If I could return it....I would.,"I loved the first three books in this series, couldn't put them down. I waited on pins and needles for months, following the official website, dreaming of what this book might contain. I'm so dissappointed, I could cry. It's slow, boring, and did I say slow? I can appreciate detail, but when the detail has no purpose, and goes on and on for pages,then it's easy to put the book down (not a good characteristic for a novel). If I hadn't spilled taco sauce all over it, I would return it."
5,Loved it!,"This was worth the wait, details and layers and subtext and a joy. The characters as usual are drawn in a bold and three dimensional way, and it is a treat to uncover the many clues and red herrings the author offers."
4,Too short,"Need more. follow-on was due less than a year after this was released. It did not come. Thus, four stars to express my disappointment, though of course I am still waiting... and will buy the next when it appears. What gives, GRRM?"
1,For good sakes get an editor!!!,"a 1000 page book that should have been 300pagesAs a big fan of GRRM first 3 books in this series I was VERY unhappy with this boring book.It's long, slow and lacking focus. He introduces a bunch of new characters, but these new people are so caught up in playing ""the game of thrones"" it's difficult to get any character depth or backstory out of them (so we end up caring very little about them).Worse the few chapters in this book dedicated to the characters we are already attached to are rarely dramatic or fantastic:i.e. learn how to be a fish monger in venice... or get a firm understanding of tedium of traveling along the kings road.I would suggest waiting for the paperback version, and then reading only the jamie chapters."
1,"Nasty, brutish, and (should have been) shorter","My summary says it all - the series that started with such promise ends with a dark, dull, sickening thud. If you enjoy reading about the darkest types of violence, torture and rape then this is for you. Plus, despite being overrun with needless pages on 3rd-rate characters, this is NOT the conclusion - surprise surprise, there are more books to buy!What a disappointment after a solid book one this series turned out to be. I think it's the only Fantasy series I ever started but didn't finish (will not be buying book 5)."
2,Terrible reader/dull story,"Having listened to the first three books on CD read brilliantly by Roy Dotrice, I wonder why they switched to John Lee for Book IV on CD. His voice is virtually the same for every character,and with so many characters, I had to constantly skip back to see who was ""talking."" And there really is too much TALKING and not enough action in this volume. Back to Roy Dotrice and John Snow and Jamie and the Imp!"
2,Ugh,"This series has become increasingly disappointing. I always have respect for an author who can kill main characters, however this is ridiculous. There is almost no one left to care about. All the ""good guys"" are basically dead or lost or engaging in questionable moral activity. I think George R.R. Martin is a sex starved & cynical man. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to finish this series. Why bother? Also, I'm going to punch the next person who compares him to Tolkien."
2,Not as good as its predecessors.,"Books 1-3 sucked me in. The only reason I was able to get through this entire book was that I must finish that story, but unfortunately a lot of the excitement was lost for me with this read.For starters, how I missed Tyrion! Not just that, but so many characters you know about and want to follow their stories, but instead we keep getting new characters which are nowhere near as interesting (one chapter in Dorne would've sufficed). The whole book is littered with filler, and it never really seems to get to the good stuff.Nevertheless, I'm in this thing to the end now. We'll see how the last books fare."
2,Treading Water,"I felt like I had been conned by the time I was mid-way through this book. It is a complete time-waster. Feels like the author had simply lost his way and had to keep the series alive with irrelevant stories about mostly irrelevant characters and plot lines. I finished it because there may be a few details in it that will be relevant to the books that follow. If there is a Cliff Notes for this volume, get it."
3,Disappointing on Many Levels,"I wanted so much to like this book more, but it just wasn't as good the previous novels. Martin seemed to be ailing from the Robert Jordan Syndrome: a large book with little to no real story or plot movement. Even more annoying are the characters Martin chose to bring forward. Supporting characters from the previous novels that brought nothing new to the overall story arc. Returning characters were taken in directions that were unexpected and not enjoyable. I'm not sure what Martin was thinking with this novel. Now, the book wasn't altogether disappointing. The novel had its good points. It was great to see Cersei come forward as a point-of-view character. She was quite mad and made decisions that will have great repercussions for the future, but still a lot of fun. A Feast for Crows was not up to the same level as the previous novels in this series, but it's still worth reading."
1,falling into the same slide as other epics,"Definatly not worth the wait, not only that he allowed his publishers to print only half the book. GRRM has fallen into the same genra now as Jordan, Goodkind, and other epics fantasy authors.. these people need to take a class in how to end a good saga while it is still good.. Sadly we will get another 4 or 5 books like this, truthfully we dont need as many, but apparently he needs more money to buy more of his precious knights... A shame, the seriees started off so good, now it will end in shambles"
4,Crows and Silent Sisters,"George R.R. Martin takes us there again....or does he? While his epilogue explains the lack of certain character development we must be wary of whether he is selling out like so many other authors..namely Robert Jordan. But no, in actuality he is playing the smart card with this recent release. Unlike other authors he is giving us depth into characters that are important to this series, but otherwise might have been glossed over in a chapeter or two. I mean really... I just want to know what is happening on the wall...or do I? That is the problem, to decide about what is actually revelant, and what isn't. I have faith. I have faith that he will pull it together in the next book or so. Other than that Lil' complaint, I loved it. I read it in 4 days."
1,A Feast for Fools,"Mr Martin has jumped the rails with this lost in the woods tale. I could tolerate the changing character POVs in the first three books even though I found Mr. Martin's habit of killing off the most interesting of the lot annoying, but in this book he not only kills, maims and discards the good he keeps and focuses on the bad. Why would anyone move on to the inevitable next book, when there is no one of any interest left. Surely the base for this series is not so desperate for reading material they will keep reading when nothing is left to read. I hear there is a fifth novel, glee! Only at gunpoint, I'm off to find a graphic novel or kiddie book, something with some substance. After this Great Expectations sounds like an exciting read. Do the right thing stop at book two and make up your own ending. You'll be happier and better served."
1,A noodling free jam,"Haha, this is truly a soap opera without end, throw in an occasional perceived resolutionFriday which actually creates more trouble, and go on and on and on, even repeating long long verbatim passages from earlier books, until this final Noodle of Noodles.Final for me, that is, I'm off this trip."
2,Filler,"I read all four books in this series in about a month. And I loved the first 3, but this one seems like filler. All my favorite charactors are virtually missing. I'm gonna read the next one with the hopes that it will improve.If you're looking for the best fantasy series, I'd recommend Steven Erickson."
2,ANGRY,"I am so sick of authors with gigantic unfinished works. Someone gave the first 3 books to me for Christmas, and I purchased the fourth myself. I've enjoyed the series up to this point, but when I came online to find the next, i discovered it isn't yet published.This reeks to me of Robert Jordan. I am sick of unfinished series! There should be a frigging warning label on the cover of the first novel that the series isn't finished. I am on the verge of just stopping where I am in book 4 and waiting for the series to be finished before I read anymore...... If it ever does get finished."
2,George what have you done to your masterpiece?,"I happen to have been an enormous fan of this series. At least until now. Martin produced significantly more material than the publisher wanted to pack into one book. Rather than rotate through his entire cast of characters in this book he has chosen to focus on just a few. So no John, no Bran, no Tyrion, no Dany and her dragons. Of the characters I like best we see only a few chapters devoted to Arya while of the characters I like the least we get page after page after (gloriously written yet insufferable) page. ARRRGH! Don't bother skipping ahead to get to the good stuff, it's simply not in this book.Boo!Hiss!I can't wait to get the next installment, rip out the chapters, and interleave them as they should be."
3,...and the series stumbles,"As others have noted, this is a step back from the first three in the series. Most of the characters this book focused upon are awash in a sea of vapidity. The story would have been more enjoyable if several of these characters had ridden to oblivion (eg, the wrong female was pushed and made to ""fly""). Thankfully, Brienne and Arya are still around to give the book some depth and excitement. I hope Mr Martin returns to what made the first three such an enjoyable read: urgency."
4,Good stuff!,"Once I re-introduced myself to all the characters and various family trees this one slipped on like a pair of favorite shoes. Would have to say that the 're-aquainting' took about 100 pages with lots and lots of back and forth flipping to the appendix of families in the back - it was worth the effort though. This is an enjoyable addition to the series, and frankly the lack of storyline on some of the other characters (they'll be in the next book) was not a bad thing. The story moved along a bit faster and you bobble back to a prior story line sooner (satisfying some of that 'what happens next?!' issue). I'm not going to mind in the least backing up in the time line to read book 5 (but will have to probably re-acquaint myself all over again by the time it's released). This is a well written series - I highly recommend it."
1,A Real Shame,"Like everyone else that has written a review for this book I also loved the first three books in this series. Honestly, the best I have ever read. I tracked the progress of A Feast for Crows for years in excited anticipation. My wait has sadly been in vane...This book is a complete disappointment. All I see is an author or publisher or combination of both trying to make more money. Why would you, Mr. Martin, produce a book that is so obviously trying to drag out a story with endless/useless detail just so you can continue a series beyond necessity and earn a few extra dollars? Where is the want and desire to produce great literature? In my opinion, Mr. Martin came so very close to creating one of the world's best fantasy series but instead opted for greed and has ruined the potential. This book is a waist of time and I recommend no one read it.What a shame..."
2,Utter Disappointment,"It's not just the choice to pluck out the most interesting characters that had thus far driven the plot and made the series, it was the choice to go so deep into detail regarding characters we have little care for. Telling the readers of their clothing, ancestry banner and accomplishments means so little when we have nothing invested in the characters to begin with. Tis seems a fundamental point Martin missed out on. It's my hope the series made for television takes this into account. Is book is droll. If the next is equally droll I will stick with watching TV."
3,A disappointment after book 3!,"It was always going to be hard to follow book 3 which was outstanding, but book 4 missed the mark for me on a number of levels. Firstly, too many new characters and plot lines were introduced which had me scratching my head to keep up. Secondly, some key plot lines and characters were completely abandoned in the book with no explanation given until the end of the book which was very frustrating. It takes a dedicated reader to keep with the overall plot and to recall plot lines from literally hundreds of pages previous..."
2,OUCH!,"Sorry Mr. Martin, but I, as well as others, think this book had one main point - to net some coin (maybe the secondary reason was just wanting to get something to the clamouring readers). I have been touting the series as the best since Tolkien...until this book.Most of this work could have been put into one chapter each of the main characters and this would likely have sustained the original story. A few chapters in I became bored with the book and the onslaught of character names. The editors should be red-faced over this book which is the downfall of an amazing series thusfar. Great reading is always a combination of great writing AND great editing and the latter was certainly missing."
2,"Yeah, uh.....dragon withdrawal here","Okay, you are going to buy this anyway. So that's not what this review is about cause we all have to have this book, you know that. But I'm totally lost on this one. I gave it 2 stars because of the huge conglomeration of people, names, politics, and just freekin STUFF that Mr. Martin somehow manages to keep track of cause I sure can't. I am going to follow the advice of previous reviewers and skip this one and pray to Orlando Bloom and Hugh Jackman (I worship these guys, the two sexiest monkeys on the planet)that he gives us a synopsis in the next one."
1,he sold out,this is a sorry attempt to stretch out the series to make more royalties from his publisher. i would be shocked if he finished the series in six books as he originally planned. i am very disappointed. the genre and writing is very different from his first three novels in this series.
5,Would compare to Tolkien only because there'es noone better to compare to,"Great book, great author great, series. This is one of the best high fantasy author's I have read in quite some time. I can only compare to Tolkien the work is exceptionally complete, all the sub stories wrap together with pure beauty. The kind of books you can't put down till there none left I have already ordered the pre-release on the next book."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,Don't waste your time unless you are an insomniac in desperate need of sleep!!! I already pay for HBO so I really don't see the need to buy anymore of Mr. Martin's blatherings about fingers & chins dripping bacon grease or how deep an impession Sam's foot makes in the snow. I mean REALLY?! An entire chapter of Sam walking and talking to himself?!!! Or was that book 3? The mind reels from monotonous droll.
1,A bore,"I'll keep this short since previous reviewer's mentioned the same feelings I've had. This is a totally different book from the first 3, centering on new characters that were rarely mentioned before. Large amounts of story happen behind the scenes and we never get to read about the important plot points. Most are just mentioned in passing, usually one or two lines. There are large amounts of dreams and scenes that do not carry the story foward, you can skip pages of descriptions and dreams without losing any plot points. Overall, a very boring and tedious book after reading the first three. Very disappointed, I may stop reading this series all together. It seems like George R.R. Martin is now just in it for the money. Very sad."
1,"Too many characters, not enough action",Its tedious. But I keep on reading since Im hoping for some action same as in the first three books. By now Im almost through and am very dissapointed. Am not going for the fifth book. Whats the point since the reviews say its more of the same on and on and no action? The author got stuck in his story and cant figure out how to end it. Its a pity. This fourth book should have been the last and ended with fireworks. Not just continuing with a flow of new boring characters that you have no chance of remembering anyway. Its just filler. There are so many other good books out there that I prefer to read instead of the next in the series. I hope you have patience if you buy this and the next and apparently also the sixth. Good luck.
2,What happened?,"Okay, I rarely write reviews but this just had to be done. What happened? I was so eager to read this book after the way the last book ended. Then I buy the 4th book & I just find myself skipping around trying to find the characters I'm interested in! I think I honestly skipped half the book & now I don't know if I should by the 5th because of all the bad reviews. Why did Martin do this to us, he's an excellent writer so surely he must have known that the books were heading nowhere? That the characters were getting lost? It's like bad sex, eager to start but near the end, you just realize there's not really going to be a satisfying climax (Tyrion might have liked that comment...if you could find him anywhere)."
2,what the heck!,"I got hooked into the Game of Thrones series and read the first 3 books relatively quickly. I will say that I not necessarily a great sword and sandals - fantasy kinda guy, but loved the first 3 books. I also enjoyed the HBO adaptation that I watched streaming on Amazon. But this book.... not so much. I am a pretty bright IMHO and an avid reader, but I can honestly say after reading almost half of this book, I have no friggin' idea what is going on. There! I said it! Perhaps reading short snippets on my commute train is the problem. Or maybe the e-reader is not the best way to go. Either way, I might as well start the book again.... OMG! The horror! Because folks, I ain't gettin' it. I just ordered Bradybury's Martian Chronicles and may have an extended interlude from the Game of Thrones. Hopefully, with fresh eyes, it will start to click with me. Cheers and happy reading! Your pal, Keith"
4,Bring back ROY DOTRICE!!!,The book is great. I love Mr Martin's writing style.My issue however is with the audiobook version read by John Lee.He is not ROY DOTRICE.Mr. Dotrice is a far better reader than John Lee and was sorely missed in A FEAST FOR CROWS.Listening to the book made me want to read it instead because of how much I missed Roy Dotrice.If you have listened to the first three like I did instead of reading them than I suggest you read A FEAST FOR CROWS instead.You will really miss Roy Dotrice's characterizations.
1,"Tale is fine, teller is awful","When I began listening to these audiobooks, it was hard to get used to Roy doltrice's voice. He has his vocal eccentricities like any narrator. He tells the story well, however. John lee, on the other hand, is simply terrible. He speaks with over-enunciated consonants, extended vowels, and obvious pretention. He sounds like a poor imitation of a British William shatner failing an audition for a Shakespearean tragedy. DO NOT waste money on this audiobook, go for the devil you know. I made it through the prologue and halfway through the first chapter before I had had enough and set out to get the Roy doltrice narration. I'm not usually picky like this, but this narrator's voice seriously detracted from the story to the point of unenjoyment.As for the story itself, I know that this book is about the westeros characters, while Arya, Tyrion, and our favorite dragon queen will be the focus of the next book. Grim and addictive as ever!"
4,It's still GRRM,"Yes, it took forever for this book to come out, and yes, GRRM decided to split the story in half, making us wait until next year for more Tyrion, Jon, Bran and Dany. But even though it's missing some of the best characters, AFFC is an important addition to the series. For one thing, it's the best written book of the series so far. It's also got the most thematic depth (for instance, the imagery of the titular carrion crow that keeps popping up). This volume takes a step back from the action, focusing on the development of several characters, and showing us the toll the war's taken on Westeros. GRRM gives us some very juicy revelations about both the backstory and the future of the series. As long ASOIAF fans don't go into it expecting another Storm of Swords, there is a lot for them to love and ponder in this book. Let's just hope GRRM makes good on his promise to deliver book 5 within a year - I want to know who or what Coldhands is!"
2,Dis-interested at best,"I hate to trivialize my review so much - but I did not care a single iota about what I was reading. I found myself having to search old character lists for references to the obscure folks being featured in this episode, wondering why I was being subjected to the events occuring in this book and worst of all - I had no desire to even read the upcoming Dance w/ Dragons upon completion. I fondly remember staying up late with the lights on to read Game of Thrones and endlessly chatting about the end of Storm of Swords. It's almost as if this latest installment was a Story-Published-In-The-Same-Universe as GRR Martin's Song of Fire and Ice for as much enjoyment as I got out of it. This was a chore."
2,Oh Dear !!,"Just put down the book after going through about 10 chapters. Oh Dear....it's been so long since the first 3 books that I had trouble getting back into the story. The Characters I wanted to know more about, Jon Snow, Bran, Danerys aren't in this book at all. I flipped to the back and read he's saved them all for another book to focus on those characters. This is the like the wheel of time all over again....nothing much happens in the book, it tooks ages for the publisher to release it and now I've to wait until next year to read about the characters I care about ?!! Dooh !! I'll probably pick it back up when I've nothing else to read but I'll be waiting for the paperback of his next book this time.....I feel cheated."
2,"Disappointment leads to first review, ever","I'm one of the ones who pre-ordered this book and waited impatiently through the recurring delays for the release of this book. I had high hopes that Martin would not sucker his fans into having to buy yet another book after this one to get to the end of this story. This seems to be the trend with fantasy authors these days, and frankly, I'm getting fed up with it. This book needed some heavy editing, and if it had been edited, maybe yet another book would not have been necessary. I was very taken with Martin's writing style in the first three books, and I found it refreshingly different, but when it's strung out, it can be excruciatingly boring. I will not pre-order the next book, but will wait for good reviews before buying. Caveat emptor!"
2,Dissappointing,"To be succinct: I loved the first 3 books. This book was not as engaging as a 600+ page book needs to be and I am very concerned that To Dance with Dragons will not answer the cliffhangers present in this book.There are a number of cliffhangers in this book - some real good ones. In fact, just when I was considering giving up on this one it started to get interesting and the fate of some major characters is really left up in the air. Then it ends and there is a note from Mr. Martin explaining how all the other narratives will be in the next book - BUT - when will we find out the fate of the stories in this book? Book 6? Long and a bit dull with no pay-off for two more books is just asking a bit too much."
2,I should have stopped with book 3,"I loved the first three books in this series, but book four is definitely a disappointment. Most of the interesting characters from the earlier books are left out of this book; the most compelling plot lines from book three are left unresolved; a whole new, seemingly irrelevant plot with new characters in another country is introduced; we spend most of our time with Jaime and Cersei, whose introspections become frankly tedious; and pretty much nobody seems to get anywhere. The book feels like a holding pattern.Most disappointing of all was to reach the end of book four and find out that book five isn't published, and quite possibly never will be. With all due respect to the author, who is clearly a terrific writer, this book adds little value to the series and its content should have been left to wait for the more interesting material to be done, if ever."
1,Boycott this series,"Shame about Martin, when he started the series it had such promise. This book was, as he admits on his website, only half of a book and to add insult to injury he wants his fans to stop bugging him because he will finish the other half when he gets round to it. Since his last update on his own site was January 2008 when he said that he had no idea when the next volume, which will bring the series about half way would be finished, I would not hold my breath. Personally I shall be boycotting his books in future."
2,Where's the beef?,"Like putting together what promises to be a beautiful puzzle, only to find out that the most important peices are missing. If he writes what should have been the rest of this book any time soon, I'll have to edit this review and give it more stars. But this book was written way too long ago to have the story left unresolved."
2,Arrgh,"I think he could have made this a five book series rather than a seven. While I have enjoyed the format and the character development, and the plot twists, its started to get hackneyed. Every time you start to take an interest in a character they are cruelly maimed or killed. We get it, life is tough, and if you are in any way involved with anyone in power, you are going to die a horrible death. If you are a nobody, you still die horribly, but with less ink. If you are cute and spunky, you die slower. And if we start to run out of the hundreds of cannon fodder characters, we just introduce new ones.I don't know if I'm going to buy the next book."
3,"An interesting read, but not ""gripping""","This book was fairly mediocre. I enjoyed reading it, but found that the story really isn't advancing very fast. Martin focuses predominantly on the characters associated with King's Landing, which worked fine. However, there's not enough substance and pace, and the story line does not advance far enough in my opinion.If you're on book 4, you gotta keep going. This series is one of my favourites, second only to the classic LOTR. This book, though, is the weakest one to date."
2,"What, no editor?","As much as I loved books 1, 2 and 3, I was deeply disappointed in 4 for the same reasons others have stated: the book is sorely in need of an editing. Martin is a very talented writer and I enjoyed the book once I lowered my expectatons; but I was deeply discouraged to lose another favorite author to bloated book syndrome. I have nothing against massive tomes provided they go beyond the plot equivalent of playing with your food. My former favorite author, Robert Jordan, has done the same with his last several books. Have these authors become so big because of their early successes that no editor feels worthy enough to call them on the carpet for their self-indulgence? Ultimately, he is the author and is free to do as he will. But it would be nice to be respected as a reader by authors delivering on the goods and not padding a series, whether for financial profit or just because they enjoy writing the series so much."
2,A rasher of suet.,"My nuncle and I rarely agree on anything, but we both mislike this entry in the series. Whereas George R.R. Martin has offered more or less leal service to his fans in previous works, rendering his reader a rasher of savory and succulent bacon, the entry in question was more like eating a shirt of rusted chain over a jerkin of boiled leather.In all seriousness, this is what happens when an author decides the characters in a character driven narrative transcend the plot so entirely, there ceases to be a need for a real plot. Whatever the characters are doing, no matter how trivial, is interesting because the characters are intrinsically complex and worth examining. Wrong. (Though I must admit for the sake of determining bias, I was not as impressed with the series as a whole up to this point as some, though I found it entertaining)I give it two stars because I have certainly encountered much worse. However this was definitely a disappointment."
2,You can skip this one,"It looks like many have already said this, but this book is meaningless filler between three very good books and what I hope will be a good fifth book. Skip this one, the fifth book will pick up where the third left off."
5,Review for A Feast for Crows,This book was amazing in the continuing saga of the Iron throne. It told a great story of the characters of Kings Landing. Well written and on the edge of your seat. George Martin is an excellent writer and I cannot wait to get the next book in the series.
4,Worst of the 5 books so far...,"Book was the worst of the 5 books out but it was still good.I only read it because I feel like I have to finish the series; however, it is the shortest of the 5 books and is a quicker read."
3,An Unfinished Work,I would stop here. None of the stories are finished after the fifth book. I feel gyped by the unfinished tale.
2,Almost finished!,"I took the advice of several reviews and divided my reading into ""mini character books"". This has worked for me as each character's story has stayed fresh in my mind. I've finished Jaime, Brienne and Sam and am still left with many questions. This is not as fun a read as the first three books. The story is moving along very slowly and I find myself skipping over extremely descriptive sections regarding food, clothing or the scenery. I thought ADWD was the last book, but just read that there are a total of 7? Yikes - might have to take a break and read some other things. It's almost become work reading these books!"
4,Worst in the series but still 4 stars,I read this book in 2 parts for 2 reasons. I wanted to finish it closer to when ADWD came out and because it was so slow for the first half of the book.My biggest problem with the book was the Brienne chapters in the first half of the book seemed to accomplish nothing. All I remember from them is trees.The second half of the book makes up for it though and really made the read well worth it. If I was to suggest this book to someone I would recommend reading the Brienne chapter summarys from the first half of the book on [...].
3,The Bridge to Nowhere?,"I fully agree with others in that Feast for Crows is a bridge to the next book. I plodded through hoping that something would happen. Alas. Please note that the digital edition is one dollar more than you would incur getting the actual book. Goes with all of the former books, too."
5,A Feast for Crows,Book four in the ongoing saga of Martin's captivating story of heroic men and women and the despicable machinations of power hungry people. Highly recommend this series of books to the fans of sword and sorcerey genre.
2,book series,"I thought the author tried to introduce too many characters, and they were all uninteresting. He killed off all his main characters so had to replace them with totally bland ones that I could not care less about."
3,3 stars is a good rating,"Definitely worth the read, I won't hesitate to drop a series based on one bad book - this is NOT a bad book, but the other reviews were a bit too critical IMHO. Then again I had the luxury to read all 5 books straight through so far...if I had to wait 5 years for the book to come out I may have a different opinion. I think people just didn't like it bc it didn't pick up with the characters everyone wondered about in book 3. In my world...3 stars is a good rating."
3,not as good as the preceeding bookds,"i really loved this series in the first 3 book. But this one seems to drag on and wander, and still more characters are introduced, making it harder to keep track of everyone. I'm 2/3s of the way thru it and and still no mention of Tyrion or the dragon princess, 2 of the most interesting characters. Seems like the author has lost his way in this labyrinth he's created."
1,terrible,"there are only two semi-interesting events in this book, all in the last 50 pages of a 780 page book...the fact that the book includes a mea culpa statement on the last pages indicates even he knows this book stinks...this book appears to have been written to maximize profits off of fans"
5,The characters are compelling...,"I am totally wrapped up in Game of Thrones, and I haven't seen any of the series - just read the books. The characters, and their development, are so alive I feel like I know them (or maybe people in my life who have similar characteristics!)...hurry up with book 6!"
4,A feast for all,Great book and a rare thing to see the tv series is almost as good as the book and stays very true to the storyline. I will be reading more.
4,A feast for readers,"I felt the book started slow, but it ended well. Stonehenge was barely touched though, which is a woeful shame."
4,Still a good read,"It took me a while to work up the courage to read this book, after reading the poor reviews by other readers. I wasn't disappointed though. I'm not much into the Iron Islands side of the story and I wanted to put the book down while Aeron Damphair was prattling on, but the rest of the story was an enjoyable read."
2,A disappointment after books 1-3,"Other reviewers have said it better than I can. I read book 4 in the series despite the lukewarm reviews, but this will be the last. After reading this book and reading the reviews on book 5, it seems that after book 3, each book is getting progressively uninspired. I'm not normally one to abandon a series once I'm hooked, but after reading the book 5 reviews and seeing the $14.99 Kindle price for book 5.... I'm done with this series. The first 3 books were good for the genre, but far from great literature."
4,Still going on,"Characters drive this story and even four books into it there is a connection to characters. The characters in this story grow and change and have real faults. The continuing saga of the warring families could stand on its own, but is richer as part of the series. The story moves locations and can get a bit confusing but otherwise this is a great read while you are relaxing."
2,lost it's charm,Loved the first but this book was all over the place. George Martin and this series lost it's charm. To bad as I loved the first two books
3,hmm,"ehh it just okay, not as good as the first three but if you like the series then you have to read it"
2,I don't always write reviews...,"When one reviewer writes a bad review it may be attributed to a difference in taste, when pretty much everyone says the same general thing there is probably something to it. I was a big fan of the first three and ignored the bad reviews for Feast and now I regret it since it was a waste of time and money. I've never would have expected it after the first three but the fourth is a much inferior installment in terms of narrative, style, and especially pacing. I would encourage anyone thinking about buying this to first read some reviews for Feast AND the 5th book Dragons and consider those reviews together before deciding to continue investing in this unfinished series."
5,Gets better and better,"Every Game of Thrones book gets better and better. I read the books out of order because they didn't have all of the audio books in the library, but oddly enough it didn't matter if I knew how book 5 ended because the descriptions and detail are so vivid."
2,I don't think it will ever be finished!,"I read the first three installment in the supposed four part series, and waited eagerly for years for the ""final installment"". It came out, finally, in 2005. But it seems it was only Part One of Book 4. It's now been over 5 years waiting for Part 2 of Book 4 (now called Book 5, acknowledged by the author as the ""good half"" of, well, whatever it is), and the author's website hasn't even published an estimated completion date since 2008. Now I see that there are plans for a sixth and seventh volume! When? Nobody knows!I don't recommend anybody start ANY of these books until the ""final"" installment has at LEAST a firm publishing date.Come on, George, I'm growing old waiting for this series to finally end. It's just too much work carrying the torch. I give up!"
2,Feels like I just lost my best friend.,"I wanna crawl into my bed and weep for the loss of my friend.I dont think I have EVER been thing disappointed on a book before.The first 3 books were absolute daunting and extraordinary.I had never read an author that could surprise so much, I toldmyself ""expect the unexpected from him"" and even though I did hestill surprised me in the best way,But now, ohhhh now, he surprised me by creating a book I am dreadingand simply can not finish. I feel the responsibility to continue readingbut I don't want to. It is torture, its bad. I continue wondering WHATHAPPENED?! WHY IS THIS SO BAD?!I miss Jon, Dany and Tyron, and even though I still have Arya, Sansaand Jamie its still not good enough. What with all the new booooooringcharacters and storylines?. It seriously needs major editing!I am truly disappointed and I need to mournthe lost of the amazing saga of books that took the wrong turn."
2,Feast of Crows,"Some time in the book I was expecting the tempo to pick-up. At last, the final chapters did so. I had order book 5 before I finished the ""Crows."" Much to my chagrin. Wasted dollars. I should have spent the money on lottery tickets. T least I would have had a few hours of entertainmet."
2,Not whining. I have simply done what every author wants.,"Simply put, George Martin has been in the fits of terrible writers block for some time. I recognize it, because I live the nightmare. Why he felt the need to be dishonest and say that he split the books to keep their length down is anyone's guess. I am upset at his decision to do so for two reasons: 1)I feel a close connection with the characters and the desire to know their fate is very real for me and hasn't been sated for several years now, and 2)the author obviously fibbed when his readers would likely have accepted an honest but delayed attempt to attain the literary successes of his past. This series has been incredible until this entry. I'm sure that you know that, Mr. Martin. The interwoven strands were a part of the magic. Give us more of the tale soon and be straight with us in the future."
2,"Looking back at my November 15, 2005 review","Check out what I wrote on November 15, 2005, and tell me now if you still think I am wrong about this travesty...[..]Where is Dance of Dragons?The man will not finish this series, and in 15 years or so, some poor hack will be left to glue together 12 boxes of notes into a semi-coherent ""conclusion"" akin to Christopher Tolkien's ""Unfinished Tales""."
4,You people are crazy!,"I was extremely worried about reading this book after the mixed reviews. I don't understand the high number of sub-3 star reviews. Game of Thrones is an epic. It is not the story of Tyrion, the Starks, or The Dragon princess alone. To say the this book doesn't advance the plot is ludicrous. It just doesn't advance the plot in an easy way. There are a lot of layers of subtext. Things happen that at first glance are superficial, but have great, and sometimes unspoken, importance. Sure, I would love to read more about my favorite characters, but their story and point of views are not the only ones. There are no throw away chapters here."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very taken with the first three books in the series. You cannot know how disappointed I was in this book after reading those. I read all ofA Feast for Crows. At times, I considered not finishing it, but I hoped that it would become as interesting and enjoyable as the first three books. I will keep those books in my library but as far as I care, this book can go in the garbage."
3,Slow,"I was cruising through this series until I hit Feast for Crows. For some reason Martin decided to mix things up with this book; he changed the character focus, the flow of the book, the timelines, etc. I enjoyed the story, but I felt like the tempo was completely off and it took a while to focus on the story rather than where Martin was going with the series. I would still recommend the book and definitely the series, but be warned it just feels different."
2,Disappointed...,"I absolutely tore through the 1st two books. The story was fascinating, twists and turns abounded. I couldn't put it down. The 3rd book I struggled with (and I am a quick reader). This book I never made it all the way through. I keep thinking I will finish it, but its been months and I haven't even tried. If he would write more about the characters I am already interested in, instead of rehashing stories already told and introducing even more new characters, than I would have probably torn through it already. So disappointed. I really do love this series, feel for the characters, and want to know what happens!! I have enjoyed the HBO series so far. Here's to hoping the next book is better...."
1,Fonzi has just jumped the shark,"I remember being a kid and really loving happy days. Then Fonzi jumped the shark and created an industry expression for the moment that a show/series/story crosses the line and goes down the toilet.GRRM could have written an excellent book 4, wrapped up the key stories, and gone down in SF/Fantasy history as the new Tolkien. Instead he starts a NEW story line set that has little to nothing to do with books 1-2-3 of game of thrones.Had this been #1, it would be maybe 3-4 stars. As #4, it flat out sucks."
4,Added depth,This book gave more attention to characters that had been minor characters in the earlier books and added more color and depth to the entire series. It also went into more detail about places that had previously only been mentioned by name. It whet my appetite for the final book in the series.
2,Soap Opera,"Martin has acquired Robert Jordan disease. Drag a story on forever to sell books to those addicted to the soap opera. I was hoping for something heading towards conclusion, all you get from this are snippets of so many characters you start to dislike them all.This smacks of marketing first, storytelling second. I'm giving up on the series as it's taken a turn for the worse when a turn for the better was needed to save it."
2,Where's Roy? And why not both parts at the same time?,"As a person who normally gallops through reading material as part of my job, I luxuriate in hearing the occasional book that's worth the time to listen to slowly. Hearing a book gives me time to absorb all of the details, to picture each scene and facial expression, and to immerse myself in the world of the writer. Listening to Roy Dotrice made the many hours spent listening to the first three books sing. I couldn't wait to hear what happened to each person -- not each character, but each individual. I do hope Random House has the good sense to redo this book with Roy and make sure that he does the later volumes as well -- even if it holds up the release. John Lee reads some books well. This is just NOT one of them. Please get Roy back!!!!"
2,So torn.,"Have you read the bible cover-to-cover? It feels a bit like reading AFFC - there're are just times when this begins to read as so many begats. This ship begat that house, that house begat that son...I find myself skimming through lengthy passages of banner descriptions & houses & their heroes, because honestly, even if ser so-and-so will become important later, I won't remember him until his chapters come. And come I'm sure they will. Or, we'll just abruptly find out he's been beheaded and his head is tarred and awaiting further inspection.He may've lost me on this one. I devoured the first three, I fretted over certain characters, I bemoaned their grim circumstances and I would say I'm as invested as any reader could be, but I'm not buying the next one, I don't think. I'll catch up when HBO boils it back down to a bit more meat and less Genesis-flavored-potatoes."
1,Bogged in Batches of Boring Blather,"This is the worst read in the series thus far. Characters from the previous books are pushed off stage by an invasion of new characters accompanied by ponderous descriptions of their family tree, their history, their plots, and their exploits. Martin says he omitted old characters on purpose because the book was getting too big - yeah right! I think the editor forgot to strap on Martin's reins and he went trotting down his favorite path - tangents. Martin brings characters into a scene and then launches a laborious epic about a character's history or relatives. Good fiction has good pace and the pace in this book is glacial at times. It's a great book to practice your speed reading as you vault over the parsley searching for the meat."
1,Done and wish I had the time back,"I was warned that the main characters do not appear in it but I had already purchased the set. The first three were good reads but at times switching between so many ""main"" characters can be distracting. At least in the first three the characters were not that bad to read about. In this Arya but in the end she just seemed a lost distraction leading away from what I felt was the story I was following. Jaime in the end became the best to read about though by far other characters in the previous books were more enjoyable.This book could easily have been accomplished in a three chapter prologue skipping many dull details. This looks to me to be more boring Jordan'esk ramblings to continue on a story that author appears to know the end game but doesn't know how to get their quickly enough. This book is so sad when first showed promise. One word should be taught to them, trilogy."
3,riding the fence,"it's hard writing about this book. i, like, many others waited a long time and were teased with chapters on martin's website. quite frankly, this whole book is basically a teaser. it introduces new characters to make up for the absences of our favorites and only introduces new questions. which, of course, only prolongs the wait. it will be a quick read, for all those pages, there isn't a whole lot happening. now, we're back to waiting for book 5."
1,steaming pile of cr@p,"I refuse to believe that the same author who wrote the first three books of the series also wrote this horrible terrible ""book"". It is even more laughable that the george martin took five years, more time than the time taken to write *all* the other three preceding novels, to come up with this steaming pile of cr@p.Now compound that with the fact that it has been another five years since AFFC came out and there is no sign of the fifth book. In 2004-05 george martin said that the next book was ready to be published. A man of his word truly.As I said before, I refuse to believe that books 1-3 and book 4 are the work of the same author. I call shenanigans on this. If book 4 is written by george rr martin then he stole books 1-3 from some unnamed author. there I have said it.Do not buy or read this book. Do not start the series if you haven't already. The first 3 books were great but the original author is missing and some untalented imposter has taken over the series."
2,Phoned it in...,"At first, I thought the author was losing steam in the overall story. After reviewing his web-site, it appears he's more interested in marketing than in writing anymore. The novel was a paper thin plot stretched out to novel length in order to sell books, nothing more. It's strung with more dangling plotlines than a season finale of 24. Don't hold your breath for A Dance With Dragons, it's already 4 months overdue with no end in sight, something tells me it will be of the same quality. A shame, but it looks like another talented author has forgotten that it's his readership that matters, IE, Robert Jordan."
2,What a let down,"After waiting impatiently for months, it has been disconcerting to discover this latest in what had been arguably the best read since Tolkien, did not even hold my attention. I cannot work up much enthusiasm for any of the newly introduced characters, nor indeed, remember enough to distinguish them from anyone else. Further, (for the audio book listener) the reader for this last book is certainly no match for the reader of the first three books. Why can't the publishers have at least gotten the readers together so that the listener doesn't have to contend with a different pronounciation of almost every major character name? It was too good to be true. Did Mr. Martin have a junior author help out with this last, and least of a great series? Please, take your vitamins, commune with the muse and do the magic once again."
1,"So many pages, so little tension","Reading this book was a vast disappointment after book 3. It seems Martin may have peaked early in this series. I found that I had to force myself to continue reading to finish this book. Not very much action and the continuity is totally absent due to the changing perspectives of unsympathetic characters. Book 4 offers all the excitement of watching a bag of popcorn in the microwave, with the caveat that all the corn has popped in volume 3. You keep waiting and waiting for something to catch fire, but alas there is not even any smoke."
1,Very disappointing,"GRRM spends too much time focusing on characters (both old and new) that readers will have a hard time caring about especially coming from the end of Storm of Swords. There's no mention of Tyrion or Daenerys, and only brief mentions of Jon Snow. It's very hard to care about these new characters, who are introduced at a feverish pace, when nothing is mentioned about the characters we do care about.And the character arcs are belabored to the point of outright frustration. Cersei's arc did not need repeated chapters of foreshadowing. Brienne's wandering is sheer navel-gazing boredom, ending with a cheap cliffhanger. Sure, the plot moves forward (at glacial pace), but was it a story that needed 700 pages to be told. Absolutely not."
1,"The audio book narration is so horrible, you'll buy the paperback.",The narrator used here is NOT the same as the first three books. Horrible x 1000. Pass. Avoid like the plague.
2,...Sad....,"I dont know what it was about this book... I loved the first three! Even when he would make up new characters (probably to replace all the main characters that were killed in the previous novel) he still kept them intriguing and well developed. I started this book hoping that at least some of the original characters would appear sometime in the novel, but instead i was bombarded with dozens of new names to remember. I know this was only half of the book and the other half will tell of the previous characters' stories, but this doesnt make any sense... why didnt he incorporate them into this book, so at least some familiarity would be present... is the next book only going to be the new characters from the last book or the original characters? I couldnt even finish this book leading me to place all four books on the shelf. I might pick it up sometime again when i can find nothing good, but for now they collect dust."
2,A Feast for Crows,"This series started out fast moving and exciting. As a new book would come out, things started to slow down. In this latest book, I found nothing exciting, interesting, or fast moving. Mr. Martin is an excellent writer, BUT he tries to put too much background into each personality which lengthens the book and increases the boring aspect. I was actually looking forward to this book, and had paid for it 18-months before it FINALLY was released. If the same happens for book 5, this reader can do without it. The theme is excellent, the characters are fantastic and the settings are very good. I don't need to read 20 pages about how green/brown the grass is, how cold and deep a stream is, or how beautiful/gruesome a person is. This book could have been written with a least half the pages."
2,I hope the editor commits seppuku,"I'm less than halfway through the book, but at about page 300 recognized this was nowhere near as good as the first three books. In fact, it was crap.While I haven't finished the book, looking at reviews confirms this is a piece of crap book. Anyone associated with the publishing of this book (including the author) should be ashamed."
1,very disappointing,"Martin seems intent on dragging this series out as long as possible, which promises to result in it whithering on the vine. It could be a GREAT 5 or even 6 book series, but Martin seems to be going the way of Terry Goodkind.This book was full of way too much lead-up, and it ended just a half-step down the road from where it began. It also made it clear that any conclusion to the series is miles away. Honestly, I was disappointed that I purchased the hardcover, because this book, in hte end, just didn't go anywhere."
1,Waste of time and money,It seems that Martin is following in the footsteps of Jordan. He wrote a few good books and then just filled the pages with fluff to add another book. Please do not buy this book. It only encourages other authors to do the same thing. There is nothing in this book that you need to know to continue the story. I will wait until the next book hits the library or the used book store.
3,What happened George?,"I still firmly believe that GRRM is top notch in the fantasy/scifi genre. In fact, while waiting for Feast to arrive (yawn) I went back and explored his past works (most of which were quite good and showed his talents in other non-fantasy areas of writing, i.e. Fevre and Tuf).The first three books of this series were tremendous as we all know, and true fans will continue to read them as the years tick by. But, darn it, this book was not nearly his best and falls into the latter Jordan category of ""forgettable"". I hope GRRM stops resting on his laurels, stops spending too much time between books, stops overthinking the epic he is creating and gets back to doing what he does best. It will take a massive effort to undo the malaise created in book 4, but I know that HE can pull it off."
1,"""Game of Thrones"" emotionally damaging","I am so sorry I spent the time it took to read all five of the George R. R. Martin books in this series. I only continued because I was waiting for some sort of ""justice"" for the characters I had come to love. Instead, the author killed every single one in truly gruesome and heartbreaking ways, while leaving the bad people to go on. What I was left with was emotional upset and horrific mental images. This is one author I never want to meet - his mind and heart are truly frightening to me. I will never read another word by this author."
3,Unnecessary and Self Indulgent,"Martin has run amok with this one, indulging in his world and character weaving with the intensity of a fetish. Look, anybody who read the first three books is going to enjoy this one too. But it is a deeply flawed work.Nothing happens. Nothing. I could tell you everything you need to know about the plot in two sentences. Most of the book, like the Brienne chapters, have no relation to the overall plot, and are simply tedious.Worse, this volume lacks the three most interesting aspects of the series -- the best character (Tyrion), the Fire, (Dany), and the Ice (Jon). It's strictly a sideshow.Should never have been written, or at least should have been written after the series concludes, as a backstory filler.As I say, however, no matter how flawed, it's still enjoyable."
2,Unable to get through it,"As a huge fan of the first books in this series, I have been enormously disappointed by this most recent episode -- the series now seems to be going the way of Jordan""s ""the Wheel of Time"". Truly the energy and sweep of the first books is understandably difficult to maintain, but all good things must come to an end -- preferably without being spun out interminably. Other reviewers mention variously 1) that half the book was cut by the publisher to get to 1000 pages and 2) that the book is too long by several hundred pages as it is. Either way, this is a story that has bogged down, and needs some energy to overcome the mercenary logistics of word count. So, save your money and hope that Martin comes back up to bat in the next episode."
1,Skip it!,"<<May contain spoiler info>>After 3 great books I was really looking forward to this one, like many others who have commented here. And just like them, I was let down. None of the main storylines were developed in this book and instead we get to hear about Brienne and her useless struggle since she falls to the same demise as other main characters have previously. And in the end we are not even left with any cliffhangers that would compel someone to read the next book! So what was the point of that? Nothing but 5 weeks of wated time on a longwinded book. My suggestion is read a brief synopsis of this one and sign-up to get the next book, Dance of Dragons."
2,Falls way short of expectation.,"After the awesomeness of A Storm of Swords (Oberyn Martell aka the Red Viper is amazing!) Feast is a veritable snooze fest. Nothing of note happens and the pages are dominated by characters I couldn't care less about (that's being too harsh maybe not all but I couldn't care less about Cersei though). GRRM thinks he's the next Tolkien but Tolkien was consistent! Consistently good in the LOTR series, the Hobbit as well as the Silmarillon. GRRM is way too inconsistent. I would rank Storm alongside the Two Towers but Feast really is such a shocking fall from grace. It feels like Martin is trying to stretch the series over seven books by using filler material. Jaime, Cersei and Brienne are not even amongst the five most important characters in Ice and Fire in the grand scheme of things yet they take up 70% of this novel. Relative to Martins previous work this book is worth less than two stars.-rant over"
2,Dragging along,"The other books in this series were pretty good reads. After the last one I swore I wasn't going to continue. I caved in and went ahead and got it,this one took off on a whole new direction and I don't see any end in sight. Probably not going to finish the series too far off the original path."
2,"Yes it's bad, but things look up in Book 5","I'm not sure if a harsh two stars is fair, or if it just reflects disappointment at the marked drop off in quality from the previous three books. Rambling, unfocused, with little character/plot arc. The characters you're likely most interested in are largely ignored. There are a few powerful scenes in the book, but it's mostly slogging through it. The main point of this review is to report that book five, of which I've read about 80%, is a big improvement, with all the key characters (who are still alive)returning. I might never have risked reading book five if my girlfriend didn't already have a copy on hand."
2,GRR! This is where it stars going wrong,"Mayhaps his initials aren't initials - just an expression of how you'll feel when (if) you make it through this and the next tome - GRR! I loved the characters through the first three books. I just today finished book 5 and to my chagrin its just like this one - meandering, minor characters, no resolution. Every time he added a new character a piece of me died inside. But I held out hope that book 5 would bring this epic cavalcade of characters together in a fantastic conflict and resolution. I won't spoil it - but save yourself 2000 pages of time and just put this one back on the shelf, and don't even look for the next. I'm now convinced that GRRM can write characters well but has trouble with narrative. I'll watch the rest, maybe, via Netflix. SO BUMMED - GRR!"
2,very unhappy,I was ever disapointed with this book. I didn't read the reviews for book 4 because I had enjoyed the other 3 so much.But this book was divied into two books which I would have liked to know before I got to the end of the book. Goes to show the writter was after the money not the reader. I have not bought book five for that reason.
3,What a change of approach between book three (loved it) and book four. Earlier customer reviews were on the mark. This book le,Earlier customer reviews were on the mark. This book left the reader wondering what happened to the main charcaters and hungry for their update.
3,Too many new characters,I didn't enjoy this installment as well as the first three books. There are too many new characters introduced and too many old ones that aren't mentioned at all.
1,When sleeping pills dont work read Feast for Crows,Skip this boring book and and go straight to Book 5. Boring. I read this book to fall a sleep to. No way this nonsense gets made into of GOT TV shows. Bunch of jibberish of characters walking down streams and thinking about diner. GRRM should end GOT of with Book 6 and then do a prequel like the Hobbit.
5,Great Book!,"Loved the show, love the books just as much! Read these so you can finally understand why Cersei is such a ****!"
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book after really enjoying the first 3 books in the series. But I have to say I was disappointed in A Feast for Crows. The first 3 books had great plot twists and character development. So I overlooked George RR Martin's unnecessary foul language and violence. But this book in the series has reversed this so that the offensive language and violence, particularly aimed at women, takes center stage and the plot seems to be lost. I plan to read the next book since I am interested in some of the characters; however, I don't find myself looking forward to it as eagerly as I did to this book."
2,"A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four (Martin, George...George R.R. Martin",The first 2 books of this series were great. I wish I could say the same for books 3 and 4. Book 3 was a terrible let down and this 4th book did nothing to revitalize my interest.. I will not be back for the highly overpriced 5th book.
1,Warning,"What this 4th installment lacks in plot, pace and excitement is more than made up for with gratuitous and sadistic violence often against young children."
3,I enjoyed this book.,Well done. That was a nice way to write book 4. I‘m looking forward to book 5. I‘m sure it won‘t disappoint.
2,second team,"The greatest problem of AFFC is not that it was a five year wait for a setup novel that is the precursor to another setup novel (which it is). Martin is like a coach who in an important game plays his second team while the first team rides the bench. The more profound characters in whom mysteries and angst are deeply invested (Jon, Sandor, Tyrion, Dany etc.) are only shadows.For many of Martin's audience to praise the novel with 5 stars because they understand it is a 'setup novel' compounds an irrational 'Jordanesque' perception. After 5 years and 800 pages it should have been better."
1,So bad I almost don't care about Season 2 of Game of Thrones,"This book is so terrible, I can't even get through the plot summary in Wikipedia.Just awful. And this coming from a huge fan of the HBO show. I loved, loved season 1, then I read books 1-3, then stopped 100 pages in to book 4. It has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I would say to anyone, do not read these books. Just watch the show.Ugh"
3,A Feast for Crows,I found the fourth book in the series a little more difficult to read than the earlier three. The split between the fourth and fifth books is a little irritating even though I fully understand the need for it given the size of the original text
3,"too many characters, but not focus on any character","I enjoyed reading the first 3, but this book I was getting bored. Everyone can die and be brought back to life, so what is the point with the Others. The author seems like to lengthen the series. Not sure if it's money wise"
4,Crows,The book is a little different than the first three. It focuses on characters who were more of minor characters in the first three books. Is still excellent but the exclusion of Jon Snow & Tryion prevented me from giving it five stars.
1,A piece of garbage,"I won't repeat what the others have already posted in detail about this book being horrid. Believe it, it is horrid. Put ""flower"" ""maidenhead"" ""pay your debts"" ""whore"" etc in a random play word processor and you get this book. Honestly, I suffered through book one thinking ""OK, it is exposition for the series"" and book 2 and 3 backed that up, good payoff. Book 4, trainwreck. Standing alone, I wouldn't go on to book 5. Reading the reviews with book 5, obviously that is the opinion of a majority of readers.Don't start this series, there is no payoff. Waste of time and money.Believe the negative reviews, don't believe the positive reviews from the fanboys. Plenty of better selections out there."
1,Worst book in the series,Greed is spoiling this otherwise magnificent series.Both author and editors are obviously stretching the story up to the limits of boredom.
3,I hope this is a momentary faltering,"I really like the series, as a whole, and Martin is one of the few authors currently writing in the genre who I actually like. This being said, the comparisons with Tolkien are grossly misplaced (and the lapses into soft-porn are getting rather old). ""A Feast for Crows"" is a disappointment. He's teasing out plot-lines that are dull and, for the most part, irrelevant to the main story. Since book 5 is the other ""half"" of this book, I'll probably skip it and wait for the 6th (and final) book."
2,Disappointing...,"If I knew it was half a book when I started reading it I would have waited. This is the first novel that has taken me more than a month to finish in the last 10 years. It seems we may have another Robert Jordan on our hands (not in writing style, story, etc.) with too many characters and very little forward movement of the story. I am getting frustrated with fantasy series that take 5 - 10 years to complete. My advice, wait for paperback. If you're really wise, wait for the rest of the book in hopes that the story moves forward significantly."
2,Lengthy digression,"The first three were as spectacular as this one is a flop. Most chapters, with a good editor on them, would have been deleted. I wish the crows could pick this dead corpse apart and leave the slate clean for us... since it can't I still have hope Martin will actually listen to the critics and make a save with the next book... which likely I'll wait for in paperback! Save your money on this one, skip it if you can, you'll miss a lot of Cercei paranoid and power hungry delusion and an idiot journey of Brienne of Tarth. A few chapters are worth printing... the ones on Arya. That's it!"
1,Don't bother,This is a novel full of cliffhangers to a story that will never be finished. I've been waiting 3 years now on the supposedly finished (at the time) other half of the story. Do yourself a favor and read Steven Erikson instead.
2,This book is a disappointment,"After going through the first 3 books I was waiting anxously to the arrival of the fourth one.I read the review stating it is too slow paced with many words spent on food and clothes descriptions, but still I went ahead and bought it only to find it is too slow paced with many words spent on food and clothes descriptions. This books really feels like an effort to create another 1000 page volume with no real content.I will certainly trust the reviews before buying the next one."
3,Not As Good As Its Predecessors,"I'm a fan of the series but this book does not measure up to the others. Actually, not much happens in this book that advances the story line and I wonder why Martin wrote the book. With some minor exceptions the characters are boring and could have been omitted.However, there are some very good things about the book. The story of the Iron Island, the Stark girls and the irrepressible Littlefinger make the book readable. Also, Martin is one heck of a writer. Any other author would have received 1 star.My suggestion is to wait for the book to hit paperback."
2,"Long winded, lackluster and generally disappointing","I read Storm of Swords and was excited to get my teeth into The Feast for Crows. This book didn't address any of the cliffhanger in Swords, didn't speak from the point of view of Tyrion, Jon or Daenerys, and dragged on in descriptive prose for pages without any human dialogue. I found myself skipping through just to find something of substance. He introduces a lot of knew characters briefly but none that could hold my attention for very long. Jamie's sarcasm is the only thing that kept me reading for as long as I did but at 60% I think I'm going to call it quits. I can't help but wonder how this will play out on the HBO series. I'll read the reviews on book 5 before I make the committment. Such a disappointment!"
1,Author has lost his way!,The series started out great and pulled in you with the characters and the story lines.Unfortunetly book 4 is the start of George just unraveling his mind on paper. The poor characters turn into things you no longer have any care for. The book careens out of control with many story lines and loss of focus that it becomes uninteresting.
1,sleep read,I couldn't put the first three books down! I read them all within 2 months. It took me 3 months to read book 4. I could only read about 5 or 6 pages before falling asleep.
4,Too Soon,Very good book and very well written. I did not rate the fifth star as I thought a few of the characters met their demise too early. It almost felt like Mr. Martin was in a rush to get rid of them so that he could move on to writing something else.
2,"Sad, waste of time.","Why? This series had potential and now he's just milking it, writing thousands of unnecessary words to fill space. I really dont have a whole lot to say about this book other than the ending was offensive and I feel sad."
2,Can we say boring!!!,"First, I loved the first three books. But, this one is a total flop with almost no forward movement to the plot line. The dialog drags on to the point of tedium in the extreme...the book could have been cut in a third without losing anything to the telling of the tale. I'm in a real quandary whether to bother with the next book...if it is more of the same, think I'll pass.Martin needs to get back to the basics and story writing style of the earlier books!!!"
2,Can Martin go back and rewrite this book?,"I love this series and the first 3 books get a 5 star rating from me. That said if this is what he has come up with for the next two books, He should rewrite them! In this Book he goes off on tangents. If the Hound is dead, drop the subject. What is with Mother Stark still being alive? Beric? So many characters we don't need to know about. He should have stuck with the main characters and not the minor ones. It's very disappointing to read the first three and expect more in the next one and not get it. I am reading two other books while reading this one, I never did this before. I keep going back to see if it will get any better. So sad."
3,Not quite so great,"As much as I have loved this series so far, I just couldn't get into a Feast for Crows. I totally understand that Mr. Martin is building more character levels and setting the background for future plots (gotta love all those twists and turns); however, I really lost interest. It is possible that Crows was a ""let-down"" for me after all the action in the first 3 in the series, or maybe I was too disinterested to catch onto the subtleties of the plot. Regardless, I have found there to be at least one ""weak"" book in every multi-book series I've read, but I've also found it rewarding to Keep Reading! George RR Martin is still a brilliant and inventive writer in my humble opinion."
2,Yawn - Not as good as first 3 books,"Being a big fan of the first 3 books and the TV series I was willing to look past the negative reviews for this book. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Not much actually happens in this book, and the Cersie and Brianne storylines, which are the majority of this book, are incredibly boring. I hope the next book is better, although the initial reviews for it don't appear promising. Might take a break from the book series for awhile."
4,Review of Audiobook for the title,"I love listening to good audiobooks while I drive and this series has so far been amazing, and while I'm only about 20% done with CDs for this 4th book I'm having a very hard time enjoying it as I did the previous ones.The reasoning is simple, while the narrator is the same as the previous books he sounds somewhat different but I could live with that if he hadn't also scrambled all the voices he uses for the various characters as well.Don't get me wrong, so far the book seems good, if somewhat slower then the earlier ones, but the sudden drastic changes in the character's voices pulls me out of the story again and again (for example Arya now sounds like Ygritte, so much so that I keep waiting for her to say ""you know nothing Jon Snow!"")So, overall it's still an excellent book but after 100 or so hours of hearing it one way and then having the narrator voice it completely different really takes away from the immersion of this book."
3,a feast for crows,this is a book to answer certain questions about some of the characters and it moves slowly at times because of that.the characters become more interesting because of this however.
2,CROWS MISSES THE MARK,"After the first three books in this series all of which I give 5 stars, A Feast for Crows was a tedious and almost painful read at times. Some legitimate setup was necessary for the future but much of this book is boring filler about nothing. ( Seriously, WHO CARES what Alayne(Sansa) is going to wear for her ride down the mountain, whether her shoes fit or not,and who cares how many times little Robert spits up ? He's fragile, we get it.) Mr Martin needs to win our respect and our interest back in A Dance with Dragons. He absolutely enraged us by killing off almost all of the Starks after getting us to love them in the first book. Then of all things he has one of the finest swordsmen of all, Jamie Lannister, lose his sword hand. What ?! That makes about as much sense as Stephen King making Roland the Gunslinger lose his right hand in the Dark Tower series. A Feast for Crows could have been half as long. A Dance With Dragons needs to win back our respect and fevered interest."
1,Over-hyped mess,"The first book was somewhat interesting, but then I believe the author got carried away with his fairly decent reviews. Too many characters, religious twaddle, incest, fights between families/kingdoms,and a never ending plot/story. Does not even come close to ""The Lord of The Rings"" as mentioned in some reviews. Can't even get a decent resale price to get rid of these books."
2,Shame on George for releasing this book,"It is not up to the standards of the rest of the series and is even totally boring in some places. Maybe what should have happened is that the two books should be ONE book with some editing and ego trimmed. I am upset that I wasted my money on a hardcover, and I loved the other books in the series. I've rarely been so disappointed."
2,Didn't think it would look this used.,"I bought the book used and it looked like it was in decent condition before shipping. However, I'll never know. The book I received had a bent back cover, folded pages, and a partially torn front cover. The damage looked to be caused by the poor packing job. Luckily for me, I was just looking for a cheap used copy of the book. If you are looking for something that looks nice in your collection, look elsewhere."
3,Decline & Fall,"So many reviews already articulate my dissatisfaction with the 4th book in the series; e.g., the multiplicity of inconsequential characters, the disappearance of characters readers care about, muddled narrative, the dark & depressing ambiance; BUT the characters Martin lets us hold on to are so compelling we want to hang on to find out what happens to them. Despite the flaws, the world Martin has created is compelling and addictive. Stop me before I pick up the next one! (But like every addict, I will be reaching for the next fix as soon as my pusher lets me have it.)Islands in My Dreams"
3,A Feast for crows,"The story, which continues from previous books, seems to be moving far too slow. Also jumping from area to area is becoming a strain to keep up with."
2,"A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4","The book contained very little action or resolution but lots of details on certain characters, especially Cersei. Not my cup of tea."
3,Not a quick read. .,"I like this book, but not as much as the others. It's very tough to keep track of who all the new characters are and their stories and relationship to the original story, and then try to connect them somehow. . Don't let a lot of time pass in between reads, it is very easy to get lost and too much time will just make that worse."
2,A Feast For Crows,"Very Disappointed after first three. Lacked cohesion,not looking forward to Number 5. Number 6 Had better be awesome or I'm not buying"
3,a chore to read,"First three books = amazing!This book = boringLove this series and will continue reading, but this installment isn't the authors best work."
5,Great story weaving,"Splendid storytelling for adults with multi-layered characters, complex plots and ultra real universe. NOT JUST GREAT fantasy, GREAT Literature, period."
3,A little less talk and a little more action,The drama with cut-throat action is not on par with previous books in series. I miss some of my favorite characters. Too much fluff.
1,Help Please,"I need help on this one... I went from disk 24 (which ended very strange)in A Storm of Swords (At the wedding feast of the new Lord Tulley) to A Feast of Crows, where Rob has been killed and the dwarf is in prison, and Jamie's father has just been killed.. What ..... I was on disk 2 of A Feast of Crows, when I found this. Did I miss a book in between, it doesn't seem so. But I can't find a bridge from one book to the other. Or was my last disk (24) damaged. But I find it hard to believe that so much could have happened to key players on one disk. Something seems very wrong. Please can any one help me. I spend a lot to get all these books on unabridged CD's and I have Book 5 as well.At my wits end.. :("
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Bran isn't mentioned once. What happened to Tyrion? Cerscei is boring and so is Sansa. Catelyn is brought back from the dead--Why?! Jaime is bad. Jaime is good. Danys sits on her teak bench and does nothing but listen to complaints. Too many characters not integral to the plot. George must be bored as well with his mainstay characters to have abandoned them so callously. And the Others? Four books and thousands of pages in and STILL we know hardly anything about them. {Ahem} George, you're rambling now.This book is boring. And WAY too long. Don't say you weren't warned."
2,Too much nonsensical dribble.,I loved the first three books then I hit this book and it felt like literary masturbation. I don't think I'll read the rest of the series unless the author can peak my interest again.
3,The weakest one so far.,"I like the book but it is definitely not as good as the first 3 - SO FAR - I am 50% of the way through it. I find it difficult to get through the many chapters that are introducing new characters or characters that were very minor in the other books. Meanwhile the glaring absence of the characters we have come to know and care about it, is distracting. Sometimes I feel like I'm reading an entirely different series. I can't wait to get away from the ""Iron Men"" characters who frankly are very boring and get back to Jon, Daneyers, Tyrion, Bran etc. That being said, everytime I am about to get really bored, Martin throws in a character I know. Just enough to keep me interested. I am slowly beginning to see how all of these stories and people are eventually going to connect. I like this this book series enough to be patient and wait. Again - I'm only half way through so everything could change."
3,I'm lost now,"At the end of the last book I found it hard to keep up with all the different people and storylines, I'm not getting through this one. Even if there is an end somewhere 5-10 years from now, the books are becoming insurmountable obstacles. Other authors also suffer from the ""neverending"" syndrome, notably Jordan and Goodkind. For some reason, they find it difficult to end a series and start up a new one, perhaps because they want to keep their readers, perhaps because they are so involved in their work they can't see the whole picture - or maybe they can and that's the problem. You can't have every single person in a book, that's why you have main characters! I'm sorry if I'm being unfair, but I'm a little upset that a series I really liked has gone so completely out of control. You need to be a hardcore fan to buy this one."
2,Nothing happens,"I didn't mind reading it, but it didn't advance the plot much. It would have been just as satisfying to read a summary of what happened. For this reason, I will not be reading the next book in the series. One thing did bother me. I saw a quote from the second season on the show that mentioned things that have not happened yet in this book.I think this shows that the editor/producer of the show knows that the book is boring and has just started taking the interesting parts of the next book(s).The other thing that bothered me was with all the switching around of the POV for each chapter, by the time it got back to that character, I had forgotten what was happening to them and didn't really care too much.Basically these books read more like a history instead of a story where you empathize with one or two main characters."
2,Worst book of first four!,Books 1-3 were great. Book 4 was a major disappointment. Too many new characters and plot lines. Not enough attention to existing/prior characters. Author should have done the opposite of what he did. Focus on all the characters with half the content instead of half the characters (several new). Hope book 5 is better.
3,Feast or famine?,"George, Where are the characters you enticed us to cheer for? Okay, so granted, you've killed many of them off already in the first three books of the series. But, we're still rooting for the Stark's offspring and they are barely mentioned. We even began rooting for the ""Imp"", Tyrion, in ""A STORM OF SWORDS"". But, in this latest installment, you leave us bereft of a sympathetic character to rally behind. Too many despicable Ironborn and not enough Starks or Daenerys to carry us on to a 5th installment."
4,Peace Be With You Always,"This one was a b@&%$ ! That's what George r.r. Martin said in the acknowledgments of this book, and he was right. At points in this book, i felt as if i wanted to burn it, other times I was very much intrigued by it, yet by the time i finished it I realized that it was worth reading for two reasons: it refreshed my memory of the other three books and set the stage for the next one. This felt more like a skeleton, and the next book will fill in the details, and i think this book will come together nicely after reading the next one. At least that is the hope. Peace be with you always!"
2,Fine effort for any other Author... for Martin.. not very good,"There is not much that advances the story here. Over 25% of the book deals with Cersei and Arya's story seems to be a second thought.The development of the Iron Born was terrific... but Brienne and Jaime's stories offered very little that was interesting.This was advertised as 'All the story of half the characters ' a reasonable approach by my thinking. Unfortunately, it ends the novel with stories unfinished... here is the issue with that... we have to wait for him to finish 'Dance with Dragons' before he even STARTS the book that may (or may not) finish the characters from this one.Jordan lost me after the 7th book in The Wheel of Time (I should have stopped after book 5) and Goodkind lost me during Faith of the Fallen... depending on how long I wait for 'Dance,' Martin may have lost me here."
4,Show a Little Faith,"Well, all I have to say is this:Look at the writing, people!GRRM still has his touch- even though you may not appreciate your favorite character's absence in this story (get over it, they'll be back in #5), the writing and plot-crafting is absolutely amazing. For all those who think the long chapters were extraneous, I strongly believe that, just like all the imagery and subplotting in the first three books, the ""tougher"" parts of this book will all make sense. Just give him a little time."
2,Even the Crows slept through the Feast,"I will keep this brief. Don't waste your time reading this fourth book. It is horrible. To be more descriptive, it is dead boring. After looking at the reviews for the fifth book, I will not be wasting my money or time on it. It appears that book 5 rivals the drivel of Feast for Crows. So sad. The first three books were phenomenal, one of the best series I had ever read. It seems the author is trying to squeeze as much money out of this series as he can by droning on for hours with little or no forward progression in the story line. Such a shame. It had the potential to be a great classic."
3,Yawn!,"I've just finished ""Feast"" and it was a slog. You get the feeling that all these characters are building up to some exciting climax but then it all fizzles. At this moment I almost wish I hadn't loved the first three books so much. What started promisingly is now only puttering along. I am dismayed that I now have to suffer through the other half of book 4 before we can get anywhere near a climax. At the rate the story progresses I'll be too old to truly appreciate what a rip roaring saga this could have been."
3,Lots of Things Happen!,"Boy, so many things happen in this book! Lots of events, like people going places and killing other people and getting killed. Just, like, a ton of things constantly going on! So many, that you might have trouble keeping track of who a character is, where they are going, why they are going there, and what possible relevance it might have to all of the other things going on! But don't worry about that, if you get confused about the plot, some other characters will be introduced and they will also go do things that will make you forget about what it was that you were confused about! In summary, if you like a book where lots of things happen, but you don't like to be concerned with why they are happening or if it has a reason, read this book!"
3,Get to the Dragons and the Others already!,"I agree with many of the other reviewers here, this book is a bit of a slog after the excitement of the first three books. The story is just epically spawling. And I'm also becoming put-off by the heavy, HEAVY grimness - even horror - that overhangs everything. My word, George R.R. Martin makes Stephen King look like Walt Disney! Without Tyrion's wit there's just no relief from the blackness of the story. Cersei might be the most evil, treacherous, loathsome character I ever come across. Alas, there's no sunshine anywhere to be found. Without some breath of joy or happiness to lift the story I find it becoming too oppressive for me to want to continue with. Well written or not, I rather we dispensed with the in-fighting and got to the real battle: the dragons and the Others!"
2,Jumped the Shark,"With this book the Song of Ice and Fire series has completely 'jumped the shark'. What was a rather innovative approach to modern fantasy has now succumbed to the temptation of producing an endless series of epic books.Long, rambling and self indulgent, the book has no discernable plot as far as I can tell. The compelling action and pace of the series so far has been abandoned in favour of what I assume us cynic attempt to extend the series and make more money.To make matters worse, the book just stops! Right where it starts getting interesting and things begin to happen .. with the promise that we'll have to wait for tweo books to get resolution.If you've read the previous books, keep with it, you can only hope the next one gets better."
2,After years of waiting Martin bores us to death with book 4,I read the first three books in Martins saga. Even though he can painfully drag on with mondain discriptions of scenes. He at least had a interesting story to tell with colorful characters that you loved and hated. For some reason he has chosen to kill all the interesting characters leaving us with the left over characters to fight over a realm that is basically nothing. He ignores the Dragon Princess who is the only remaining character with any interest. I can't believe it took him so long to write this book. He should refund everyone who bought it.
4,Game of challengers.,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the whole series to date. I love the way each book ends and then the next one in the series starts. Very well written and all books in this series keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Who will live, who will die. It's a surprise each time."
2,PHAGH!,"Just finished, and all I can say is, Why?Why was it so necessary to split the original book in two?-- Wouldn't a good bit of editing have served to condense things?Martin is a brilliant writer-- all the characters have texture and edges, and each has unique qualities. I find I like parts of them and dislike parts. But are they all necessary?I found myself skimming over the heraldries (""bob was the [...] of joe, a landless lord whose family were distant cousins of house jehosephat....""), and searching for those few bits that advanced the plot.I had not realized there were six books planned-- I only hope that Mr. Martin (or his editor) can get his verbal diarrhea under control before six turns into 12 or more."
2,Disappointing,"I remember completely enjoying the first books in this series, but after waiting so long to finally continue I just can't get back into the flow. It's a struggle to get engaged, almost impossible to remember who's who, or why I should even care.To many characters trying to do to much to move the story forward in a way that captures the readers attention and draws them back into that world.Maybe I'll need to reread the entire series, but after trying to plow through this volume I'm not sure it's worth the effort."
2,Hardly a Feast.,"This book was indeed bloated, not with needless words, but with whole needless chapters! It contains literally hundreds of pages of virtually nothing but people wandering from place to place with no action, no plot advancement, no character development and devoid even of interesting dialogue. Ok, that's a bit harsh, but from a ""The Master"" it's just rude.This would be a disappointing book from even an unkown author, but for GRRM it's a slap in the face to his fans. I suggest waiting until the ""second half"" of it comes out and hope by some miracle it makes up for this yawn-fest. Also, buy the paperback because you'll get so frustrated you'll want to slam the book into your head."
2,The read is not worth wait.,"I love the series and the first three books were all excellent. However, in Feast of Crows, Martin's writing is out of control. Rather than offer the cop out that the book grew big enough to be two novels, Feast of Crows should have been edited with the same ruthlessness Martin showed the Starks in the series. This book is encumbered by surplus characters and overburdened by pointless scenes. Paring down the excess would reward faithful readers with a book in the same class as the first three instead half the novel in twice the words."
2,Holding pattern,"Imagine you've been planning to meet some old friends in New York for New Year's Eve - you haven't seen them in years, you have a great evening set out, and you're flying in that evening. Then your plane gets delayed and instead of drinking champagne with your buddies, you're stuck circling JFK for five hours, buying cheap airline cocktails and getting more and more bored, annoyed, and disappointed at the way your evening is turning out. That's what reading this book is like after reading the first three."
1,Very disappointing !!!!,I loved the first three books and think they are the finest trilogy ever written. I was very excited to read this fourth novel and bought it on a business trip. Wow. What a let-down. This book stunk to high heaven. Nothing happens; there is no action. I read the first 400 pages thinking surely SOMETHING exciting will occur. But no...nothing. I can't believe the author published this piece of crud and sullied his name. I recommend you skip this one. SAVE your money...borrow it from a friend - I have a low priced one for you...
2,Couldn't Agree More with Ross Blackman,"Rather echoing Ross Blackman's review, I will just say that the literary diarrhea that has afflicted Martin in this volume will probably cause me to skip the rest of his series. Having woven the rich tapestry of characters, families and locales that made the first 3 volumes so satisfying to read, Martin should have begun to consolidate and resolve the myriad storylines. He could even have changed narrative voice to provide variety to what is becoming a monotonous device of switching from one character's story to another. In this book, it feels like one is condemned to watch an endless series of late night reruns with someone changing the channel every 5 minutes.Wake up, Mr. Martin, before you ruin both the story and your repuration."
1,there should be a law against this,"i first came upon these books sometime in 2003. in 2006 i read 'feast for crows'. then waiting forever for 'a dance of dragons' ...if readers knew that this series which started in 1997, would be prolonged forever, how many of them would have even started reading this series - paying money for them?don't authors have a responsibility towards their readers?to write three great books and then keep readers waiting forever (while the author pens other books) is dishonest in the extreme. there should a law against such chicanery.publishing houses learning from robert jordan and george rr martin, should desist from publishing incomplete books. they should start publishing a series only when the author hands in the complete set.and public should sue these authors and their publishing companies for making a fool of them."
1,Ok,"This book is pretty okay, but it kind of feels like he is only telling half the story. The ""Wild Cards"" novels created by the same author are really his greatest work, so when he is done with that hopefully he will come back to this series and finish it up."
3,Not Up To Par,"A Feast for Crows is a decent novel by an author from whom we've learned to expect greatness. The book's problems are two-fold. First, we've seen the introduction of many new characters that we don't care about. Second, the story focuses on minor characters. It seems that Martin has come down with a case of Robert Jordanites.Still, I enjoyed the chapters on Cersei and Jamie. Hopefully Jamie has learned that his sister is no good for him and that he needs to hook up with his one true love, Brienne."
2,Hmmmm....,"Just my opinion but I personally thought this CD was cheesy house music. Just listen to track 1 to get an idea of what I'm talking about. You're better off checking out DJ Dan's ""Another Late Nite Mix"". This CD is solid with original tracks and mixing."
4,Must have if u like hard sh*t with phat beats,"Another underrated southern rapper. If u like to bounce to crunk beats and hard rhymes while riding in a car...get it and get it quick!!! I recommend this for my peeps in da dirty south, but if u can appreciate our wayz, pick it up!!"
5,Milwaukee Sling,This sling will help greatly in the lifting I need it for. It was delivered in good time and was identified properly and was the proper length. It does the great work needed to save strain on the back.
4,A scholar/monk/meditator goes deep,"I like this book because it is not a simple feel-good book on Buddhism (there are plenty of those around (not to knock the genre)) but rather an exploration of some of the deeper aspects of the teachings of the Buddha. The author uses lots of passages from the original writings and then disects their meaning in clear language. There are also some essays on comtempory issues such as ""the God idea"", devotion, and karma and how it works--evidently karma IS modifiable-I still have a chance!I trust the author's authenticity and authority--he was a scholar, a monk for 55 years and a committed and long time meditator--what a combination for producing a clear ""Vision of Dhamma""!"
5,Cheating Mates - 174 Tell-Tale Signs That Your Mate Is CHEAT,"My friend told me that my boyfriend was cheating on me. Of course I didn't believe her. I searched the internet for signs and discovered this book. The information I learned from this book is unparallel to anything I would have found out from her, my friends or on my own. I'm glad I've read it. It will serve as my bible from now on. I caught the scoudrel and he's history. I recomend this reading material for anybody who is involved. Especially the chapter on the reasons why and how an affair happens. The Interogation and Surveillance chapters are pretty good too. But the signs, boy they are unbelieveable! Take it from somebody who's been there. This book is filled with information!"
2,"Hype, substitution, or Typo?","If what I ordered and what I received were actually the same, why didn't the label say Flowering Orange Pekoe Tea? It did say Darjeeling Tea, Tippy Golden FOP, Camelia sinensis. It did not brew up with the bright Orange color I expected from my days at Standard Brands Tea purchasing facility in NYC. It may have been a case of paying your workers peanuts and getting monkeys as workers. It may have been a substitution. ""Hay Charlie! We are out of orange pekoe. This turkey will never know the difference."" It could have been an honest mistake by the printer, or that monkey could have been there and left the Flowering Orange Pekoe off the label to save time and ink. Who knows?"
2,These are as useless as all the other condoms Trojan makes..,"Her Pleasure? Well if you could feel anything, than maybe. Trojan has made another thick feeling condom, therefore not helping anyone but their own pockets. Buy Durex or Lifestyles instead. Its not worth the money to buy anything Trojan."
5,Even a unlubricated balloon works better than these,"these are about the worst brand of condoms money can buy I used them and tore in an instant (they were even up to date) absolutely dissatisfied. If these were quality condoms they would have been commercialized on MTV, TRL, VH1, or HEADBANGER'S BALL but since they're not good along with everything else that's not on those 4 legendary shows than they have to be cheap stuff. Now my girlfriend is pregnant thanx a lot Trojan."
5,Must-have if your child is lead poisoned,"This book was recommended to me by a local govt. housing worker, and it's EXCELLENT. It will scare you into action, but gives practical advice and lots of information that you just can't seem to find elsewhere. As the author says, while most lead poisoned children come from low-income housing, those with the worst lead poisoning tend to be from middle-income families living in an older home that has been or is being renovated. It's too bad that most kids are never tested for lead."
2,Not Supportive Enough of Full-Time Moms,"I was disappointed with this book because I believe it too often portrayed the day to day life of a full-time mom as drudgery and boredom. While, of course, it is not always exciting and fun, nothing truly worthwhile is easy. As a full-time mom, I think this book was trying so hard not to offend either side and appear nonjudgmental that it lacked a clear focus. (...)"
2,Excellent content but a direct ... of a greater author,"This book is very well written, however it is a complete, word-for-word ... of ""A System of Caucasian Yoga"", written by Count Collona Stephan Walewski and originally published in the mid 1950's. The original book was transcribed and published in Walewski's own handwriting. There were only 500 copies printed. ""Count"" Walewski spent years in a secret monastery in the Caucasus Mountains and was instructed to write and publish the book by the heirophants. A few copies still remain in circulation. The information is provocative and the system is powerful; Some of the results from the practice can be startling. Walewski's book isn't for everyone, but it is fascinating. It may be available from Borderland Sciences in Facsimilie (do a web search). I do not know how Mr. Schutz was able to publish Kosher Yoga without so much as an acknowledgement to Walewski for his original work."
1,Misinformation,"This is ridiculous. there is no such thing as kosher yoga. yoga is an ancient meditative art form originating from Hinduism. When you call it ""kosher"" you SEIZE THE RIGHT TO CALL IT YOGA. IT IS NO LONGER YOGA. GET ANOTHER NAME FOR IT AND STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION. IT IS A HINDU TRADITION AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN LIKE THAT. DONT TRY TO ADOPT IT FOR JEWISH STANDARDS.IF YOU ARE JEW AND WANT TO PRACTICE YOGA RECOGNIZE THAT YOU PRACTICING YOGA DOES NOT MAKE YOU HINDU. HINDUS DO NOT THINK SO AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. SO PRACTICE THE REAL THING IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT YOGA OTHERWISE FIND ANOTHER NAME FOR IT."
3,Nice but old video,This video had nice contentBut man is it oldIt is an 8mm or vhs or some old format conversion
1,"Expiration date 11/06, but still stale!","I was very disappointed in this product. I wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts, but they are too stale to use. They are NOT crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me return them, so I'm out $20. I was going to try some other products by this brand, but now I will not."
