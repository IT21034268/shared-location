4,Good Product,"I bought these labels because I've had trouble with paper labels working properly in DVD players (I'm told due to the higher speeds of DVD drives). Paper labels also don't work great on CDs for the car because they pick up moisture and wrinkle. These labels solve those problem perfectly.I don't understand the negative comment about the labels being too thick, these labels seem the same thickness as paper labels, maybe even a bit thinner and work flawlessly in my Mac Mini.I am knocking one star off because they are a little bit easy to tear and they are expensive. One tip, peel off the center circle first and then peel the outer disk off the sheet.One nice touch is they have tabs built in that let you peel off the label without having to touch the adhesive. These tabs cleanly tear off after the label is placed."
3,Just a little warning,"My 3-year-old daughter was enchanted with the characters, yes, but has refused to view this video a second time. Why? Both segments contain scenes she finds alarming and scary. In the first, the young heroine-mouse quakes in terror of an imaginary weasel. In the second, the protagonists are trapped, shivering, in a collapsing ice tunnel. My kid is not particularly sensitive to dangers she can see, such as the monsters in ""The Dark Crystal."" What troubles her are imagined terrors, like the unseen, undescribed weasel of Brambly Hedge."
1,It didn't cross the pond,The original was with a British accent. The appeal was lost when an American accent. Keep it in the culture from whence it came.
2,Very Annoying,"I have 9 tattoos, and only used this stuff for one of them. Of my 9 tattoos, the one I used tattoo goo on sucks. Which I admit, was probably the fault of the tattoo artist, but he's also the one who recommended this crap. Plus, it's very messy and got ink all over everything. It sits on the surface of the skin, and turned the color of the tattoo, which got all over everything else. Since that fiasco, I've only used my tattoo artist recommended Lubriderm, it's so much less hassle. Any tattoo artist I've seen and respected, recommends Lubriderm lotion. Go that route."
1,Worst Piece Of Crap EVER !,"I thought this product would be amazing since it basically says it would. NO ! I used it and I had the worst rash of my entire life of living !! I had a million little tiny itchy bumps surrounding my entire tattoo. Not only that the rash didn't go away for almost a month or more actually. I had to put ointment on my rash everyday it got on my brand new tattoo and made all the black slide off ! So my tattoo looked old and I can see skin spots all because that damn tattoo goo !!! When I told my tattoo artist what happened she said ""OMG WHY WOULD YOU USE THAT TERRIBLE PRODUCT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BAD REACTIONS TO IT !"" T his product is the worse piece of shit ever. I would never recommend it EVER !"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Do not waste your money on this stuff: YOU DO NOT NEED IT!!! Tattoo Goo is not a miracle formula, It will not make your tattoo heal faster. all it is, is a moisturizer, and a greasy one at that! Also, it's a little disgusting to stick your finger in a tin all the time! EW! Don't waste your money on Tattoo Goo, Beauty Supply Stores and Whole Foods have many alternative natural-moisturizers and lotions that work just as well but for less!"
1,Bate and Switch,The search was done for a child's cashmere sweater.A picture and description of a lovely blue cashmeresweater and pants was shown.I purchased the set but was sent a pair of floral knit pants .The pants are not what I ordered and they are worth about .35 cents not almost $40.00.This was an expensive disappointment.I will not us amazon again.
5,A must-have for those interested in a career in criminology,"This book is a great resource for anyone that is interested in criminology, but isn't quite sure what the career options are. I have been looking for books on forensic science that included information about careers in the field but I could not seem to find what I was looking for. This book offers information on a lot of different careers and what it takes to get there. This book has really helped me become more informed on my future career options and if you are wondering about careers in the field, this is the book for you!"
1,undelivered,"I never received this product, so I can't really comment on the product. I can comment that I have been ripped off by the folks who were supposed to send it to me."
2,The Mad Minute: A Race to Master the Number Facts,What happens if the kids start from the last question and works backwards? Anyone knows how to get in touch with the authors?
4,trouble in paradise,This is the second jesse stone novel i read and it is the Better of the two.I still prefer the spenser for hire series though
4,Trouble in Paaradise,"I have fallen in love with the Jesse Stone books by Robert B. Parker. The TV movies got me interested, so I bought the first book, Night Passage, from Amazon for my Kindle and really enjoyed the down home realism of the story and the characters. Parker has taken the time to develop each character to a point and has left the rest to our imagination. The on going relationship between Jesse and his ex is definately unique. The character of Molly is very likeable; someone I would like to know in real life as a friend. The different officers working under Jesse also have well defined personalities. Now on the fifth book of the series, I have pictures in my mind of each of these fictional residents of Paradise and can predict how they will react to different situations. These books are easy, quick reads and are actually relaxing to read."
2,Two Page Chapters Don't Cut It!,"This little Parker novel was very thin, both on plot and number of pages. The average chapter length had to be two pages, and with blanks pages in between to fatten it up, it was an embarassment. Plot was pretty good and it was nice to see a new Parker character, but, puleese, spend more than a weekend writting the next one."
3,Not as good as the first book in the series,"The only thing that really bothered me about this book was how quickly the villian was defeated. RBP developed these characters (Macklin, Crow) with style. But the way they exited from the story was very weak. There should have been more interaction between Jesse, Macklin, and Crow (who may possibly return in one of RBP's other books because he got away???). There was way too much interaction between Jesse, Jenn, and Abby, RBP could tone that down a little bit as far as I'm concerned. Overall this book is a decent read, but the first book (Night Passage) in this series was much better."
1,Hawk is missing ---------BRING HIM BACK TO YOUR BOOKS.,A former drunk detective couln't replace Hawk in a million years because Hawk is the essence of Robert B. Parker's books.
5,One of his all-time best works,"I found myself skimming the crime chapters, and concentrating on the love stories of Jesse Stone. This is a new area for Parker, and the way he expressed the emotions of the principals reminded me of romance authors. Not that this is a woman's story, not at all. But Stone has grown, matured, and sobered a lot since Parker's first novel about him. The ex-wife is here, the attorney girlfriend, and another, and how Stone manages these complex relationships has echoes to Spencer's simpler philosophy, but his feelings when with them, or analyzing his complicated life, were refreshing and detailed. I think this is a real departure for Parker, and wait with baited breath for further adventures in Paradise."
5,There is no trouble with this book,"As a fan of the Jesse Stone movies, it is fun to read the original novels. I highly recommend it."
4,Trouble in Paradise,"I enjoy most of the Jesse Stone Novels. A highly recommended read. Not a five star rating because I could stop reading, wasn't a couldn't put down read."
2,Trouble in Paradise and other Jesse Stone books,Jesse Stone is a likable and sometimes amusing charactor well supported by Molly his office cop.. There is too much of his ex eife Jenn and his visits to his shrink Dix. The plot is sidelined by these two inserts . I found myself skipping all chapters about Jenn or Dix.Don
3,Read the book! - Don't listen to the Audiobook!,The story and characters were entertaining enough for a communte to and from work. But Richard Masur's narration was abysmal. I literally screamed everytime he attempted to read a female's dialog. Does he really think women sound like that?
2,Disappointing,"I liked the first Jesse Stone book, but was disappointed in this one. The trials and tribulations of Jesse's love live was overdone and the main plot wasn't strong enough to move the story along. The incident involving the teenagers was more interesting, but short lived. I am a big fan of Parker's, but this one was kind of a stinker."
2,Trouble with Booze!,"This book was a fast read,the main character an alcoholic police chief who beds all the women in the town of Paradise,MA and stops crime! The story line is Ok,but the outcome leaves little doubt of what happens."
1,You can find my book in the trash,"It is a quick and easy read, but I felt dirty and threw the book in the trash after I read it, so that no one I know will read this book. I long for another Spenser novel."
3,too much heavy emotional problems - one nighters or exwife,The crime solving was secondary to the main character's women problems. His quandry about wondering if he can love and get back with his exwife and his sleeping with others is too heavy. Spenser and Susan it ain't.
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"Robert B. Parker can say more in one paragraph than other writers can say in a chapter. TROUBLE IN PARADISE is not one of his greatest books, but even his less inspired novels stand miles above many of his contemporaries' works.Jesse Stone is a good cop. He is tough, but his sensitivity and and his desire to do what he believes is right--sometimes contrary to the harsh definition of the law--makes him one of the most genuine and likeable lawmen in today's fiction.I read this book in one night. Just couldn't put it down. Sure, the book was short. With smaller type and margins, it could have been a 250-pager. But to me, quality wins out over quantity any time. Keep 'em coming, Mr. Parker. More Jesse Stone, please!"
3,Very shallow compared to Spenser,"Truthfully, I was disappointed. I have read and re-read all the Spenser books and have hailed Parker for being so ""even"" in his rendition, but here he sinks to the level of the common thriller writer. The plot in itself is great, and there appear some interesting characters - alas, Mr. Jesse Stone, the main man, is not one of them. If you are looking for a way to pass a dull evening this book will surely suffice, as will ever so many others, but it is not something that will rest on your nightstand with you taking a peek at a sentence or a passage just before you drift of to sleep."
3,Critical of Quality,"Although Trouble In Paridise is a good read, I was brought up short on numerous occasions by type setting errors of incorrect letters and missing words. I am not sure who checks these things but they need to do better."
3,Entertaining but tiresome at times,"This is a good book to wile away an evening with. The plot was intriguing and Jesse Stone is an interesting character, but I had trouble with his approach to sex. He sleeps with 3 different women during the course of the book which I believe is only a few weeks. Doesn't he know about AIDS? Unplanned pregnancy? Sexually transmitted diseases? Or does he just not care? It got a little tiresome. The women are all beautiful, with perfect bodies, who drink like fish but eat like birds. This got a little tiresome too. In one of the last scenes, when 2 of his lovers get together to talk over lunch, I think they should have bagged the salads and had hot fudge sundaes. They deserved them."
3,Trite,"I'm getting a little tired of strong men whose strong women find them too controlling, and therefore sleep around. It's become a Parker cliche, and not particularly interesting or believable. Aside from that, the usual snappy dialogue and fast-paced plot. Second rate Parker, but not bad."
3,Jesse steps over the line from troubled to strange,"Chief Stone seems to be a competent cop, but I think he needs some intensive counseling to get over his addiction to his ex-wife. And anybody who is sleeping with three people in these days of AIDs is downright crazy if you ask me. I got tired of all the drinking and I REALLY got tired of him talking about how much he loved his cheating wife while he slept around himself. And Stone just isn't as funny as Spenser, darn it. I agree that the Spenser books have gone downhill in the past few years, but Parker still hasn't gotten it quite right with this new character. Jettison the broad, Jesse."
2,I think I got a faulty flamingo.,I'm keeping it because it's cheap though. He's leaning to the side a bit like he melted in the mail or something--which is weird because it really isn't that hot outside right now. Anyway...
5,Placated by your charmed American life? This is a cure!,"Lesson: Not all women live the life of love, luxary, and respect that American women, for the most part, have. Firdaus, the subject of this book, is a woman lucky enough to have her story told. It isn't pleasant, but it's true. El Saadawi didn't sugar-coat this tale, and I think it's ingenious. Bravo!"
2,Mediocre,"I have mixed emotions concerning the book. Having to read it for a college course, the book was forced upon me and not read for pleasure. So perhaps my opinion is slightly jaded. However, I found the book to waste far too much time discussing small details (eyes, etc.) and failed to hold onto the reader's interest. The book was slightly entertaining but definetly not a favorite."
1,Horrible,"The book was not boring or distasteful, I think that it STUNK! The grammar, description, etc. was ALL very poor. I actually found *several* errors in the book. Grammatical and spelling! All in all, I did not take a fancy to the story at all!"
5,I think it was striking,"The treatment is savage and exact--the only manner of writing that could do justice to the material. Because of this, the novel is a quick read, but it is not a light one. Admittedly the style isn't Victorian, but I haven't read a minimalist prose style this beautiful since Les Guerilles (Wittig) or Carver's ""A Small, Good Thing."" Combined with this, her understanding of the neurotic (and its origins) outpaces Margaret Atwood by leagues. Sadat imprisoned her for her writings, and I can see why. It's striking."
5,Real Writing,"Too often writers get lost in pretentious prose and ramble on needlessly. Not this book, it works like a well oiled machine, no line or word is wasted. The language is so precise and strikes with clarity. I love it. And it would be easy to write this book off as feminist, but there is an integral message here: the role we all play in exploitation. This should be a required reading for students across the world ."
4,El Saadawi's work is against global injustice,"Unlike most of these reviews, it's important to remember that Woman At Point Zero does not limit our thoughts and knowledge to a middle east that many americans find so different or horrible, where ""even Egypt"" must have a *few* decent men. Instead of contrasting this important book's horrors to our ""charmed"" American life, I hope Americans begin to wonder how many of their own imprisoned people, including those on death row, have led less than charmed lives here in America. It's much easier for Americans to look outside for the bad things, isn't it? Nawal el-Saadawi's work is just as shocking and uncomfortable and risky to those in Egypt unwilling to face that country's ugliness, oppression, and exploitation of the poor, especially poor women."
2,Too Fragrant,"Although the product worked well, it was much too fragrant. So fragrant that I only applied it once and could not use it again. What a shame."
1,Alterman and Green Deserve Pulitzer.,"I'll be brief. This book is a bombshell. Careful, scrupulous, often hilarious. I highly recommend it. (I wonder if the right wing amen chorus on Fox news and elsewhere will dare put these guys on camera. Fact after fact after fact --)"
1,The left trying to lie about the best President in 5 decades...,"This author should research the Clintons if he wants to find liars and numerous accounts of misleading the American public... All Bill ever did was lie, from day one to the very end, and he left the White House laughing in the faces of all Americans...The loosing left should leave this man alone, he is the most incredible President that this country has seen in the last 50 years...Liberals are the seeds of Socialists, and Socialists are the roots of Communists... If you do not like living in the RIGHT country... then leave...Make the change today: THINK RIGHT, GO RIGHT and BE RIGHT..."
1,Tacky,"This book is a cheap self serving way for Eric Alterman to make money of off the war on terrorism. I am a liberal New Yorker and was never for the war in iraq. But this book is so over the top with inuendo and fabrications, its silly. I wish alterman would show a little class and not have used to tradegy of 9/11 to make a few bucks for himself. It down right disgraceful."
3,If you liked Howard Dean...,"If you liked Howard Dean, do not buy this book. You already know that Bush is a ""say one thing, do another thing"" lier. As such, the book will simply repeat what you already know.What you may not know is that Eric Alterman is also a ""say one thing, do another thing"" lier. While Eric regularly excoriates other journalists for their lazy bias, he engages in the same practices when it suits his purpose. Indeed, Alterman helped sink Howard Dean by repeating -- over, and over, and over -- right wing attacks on the good Doctor."
5,All in One Place,"What I love about The Book on Bush is that it gathers the whole story in one place. I think I have read all the recent books on Bush, but if I had to recommend one to a Republican friend who is suddenly feeling very queasy, this would be it."
5,i'm physically ill,"I wish I could give a more expansive review of the book, but after page 31 I refused to read anymore. That's not a reflection of the quality of the book, more of the quality of president we live under. W is a character I thought only existed in fiction. He has completely hijacked this nation and together with Cheney & Rove created the largest bait & switch act since Three Card Monte. They have turned the gov't into a vehicle designed not to work for the people, but against it.This book should be made into a movie so the masses can see for themselves. Unfortunately, the only people that will read this book are the people who already know something is very wrong at the White House. The arguments are calm & rational with just the right amount of SAT words. Pick this up if you want to be ashamed of your president & the America he's created."
3,Boricua Author,This man wheeled and dealt the best he could while supressing his realdesire for his island to be an independent nation when Puerto Rico wasknown as the poor house of the Caribbean. He did it for love of his people. I look at him often and admire his accomplishment in that respect.
5,Maynard at his best,"Finally, the best by far of the ""MF Horn"" series is available on disc. I haven't heard it since high school and since I found the CD it hasn't left the player.This is a wonderful live performance (if memory serves for an audience consisting exclusively of record execs). This is straight-ahead jazz--with none of the more pop, commercial arrangements that characterized most of the MF Horn series. The band consited of lesser known (to me, anyway) European sidemen who really wail. The soloists are top notch. If you have even a passing interest in Maynard Ferguson this is a must have."
5,Live at Jimmy's,"This is an incredible recording, done live in Manhattan on a lunch hour in 1973. Maynard Ferguson and his big band tear up a set with plenty of hot improvisation as well as great ensemble playing. I had the vinyl version for decades and was so delighted it was available on CD that I bought two copies- one for me and one for a musician friend. It's that good!"
2,For the love of the movie,"2 1/2Most of the songs work well enough in the film, but half of these hum-drum rockers and some other popular material makes this soundtrack a hard sell, save a few tracks near the end which almost redeem this uninspired compilation."
2,Disappointing,"This would be a good book for someone who is interested in the history of fashion or pattern-making, but as a pattern book it fails.There is no adjusting for individual sizes, just a one-size-fits-somebody-but-not-you. Instead, it suggests that sizes be adjusted by using bulkier or thinner yarn. Am I to make socks out of super-bulky yarn to get my size? I don't think so.If you are knitter interested in proper fit, don't bother."
3,Loved the Patterns,"I love to make socks and have found the patterns in this book to be helpful when adding patterns. I have always loved the vintage style socks, now I can make them up for my own family."
4,Good sock patterns.....,"This book was very enlightening. I loved reading about the history of socks and how little making them has changed over the years. I gave 4 stars only because I thought there were too many patterns for men. I realize that one can change that over to make them for women, but I'm not that advanced in the sock world as yet. Otherwise the book is really good. Good instructions, easy to follow."
5,Knitting Vintage Socks,This is an excellent book. Full of history and patterns. So glad I purchased it.
5,A Must Have Book!,"I teach workshops where I teach a simple system for eliminating debt. I also publish a weekly newsletter on the same subject. I'm on Mary Hunt's email list and am quite familiar with her work. Often I include one of her articles in my newsletter. When I learned about this book, I had to get it to see how it might complement what I'm doing.To say I was blown away is an understatement. I believe it is a book that every family should have as a reference. I immediately ordered copies for my married children.In my classes I have a segment where I show people places to find money to accelerate their debt payments. This book goes into more depth on many of the areas I bring up. In fact I will be adding some of her material to my workshop.To say that this book is re-hash of other books out as one writer here says doesn't do this book justice. Sure the pricniples can be found in many books, even my own, but this shouldn't subtract from the value of Mary's book."
5,Amazing book,"I was given this book as a gift. It has many wonderful suggestions in it for everyday living. It's not like other books that just talk about concepts for saving money; it tells you ACTUAL THINGS TO DO to save money, with directions and shortcuts. I bought a copy for a friend from amazon.com and may order more later. Dynamic book!"
5,Helpful Book!,"This book has been very helpful as a resource tool for my husband and I since we purchased it. We both have appreciated the helpful, practical, and feasible ideas and tips on how to be WISE in ones spending habits. Topics range from all aspects of where one's money goes -- from groceries, to supplies, to automobiles, to insurance, to computers and other big ticket items. We felt the book was easy to read and appreciated that it was laid out in a fashion where we could easily refer back to chapters on certain areas of spending."
2,Description and image not consistant with actual product.,"I ordered these Now & Laters and they are not what I requested. The Image shows a tub of Giant Now & Laters. What I recieved was a tub of the regular sized Now & Laters in the classic flavors.According to the list, the flavors should be:Tropical Punch, Banana, Apple, Grape & CherryThe product actually contains:Watermelon, Strawberry, Apple, Grape & CherryThey arrived in a timely manner and were fresh, but it is not quite what I thought I was getting. There is a mix up in description in a few of the other Now & Later vendors pages as well. Be mindful of that and verify the description against the image. I merely wish people to be aware of what the actual product is so they won't anticipate getting the flavors I was expecting and wind up being disappointed. Hopefully this relatively minor issue will be resolved."
3,not as pictured,"the description says assorted flavors include: banana and tropical punch but my container has ZERO of these flavors. In fact the container says the 5 flavors included are apple, watermelon, grape, cherry and strawberry. I wouldn't have ordered since banana is my favorite!"
5,Hockey and Humor: 2 things that go hand in hand,"This book makes you love the game even more. Quotes from and about hockey's greatest players, most memorable events, and off-base topics will have you reading this book from cover to cover, nonstop. Its witty paroxyms of absurdity and out right hilariousness will have you falling out of your chair while tears of laughter stain the pages. Definitely read this book!"
5,"Hockey's Funniest One Liners in a fun, easy to read format","Hockey is a conducive book for great one lines. The history of hockey has some great characters who said some hilarious things. Whether a current stars or all-time greats, this book is filled with some hilarious lines. Of course, I'm biased since I wrote the book, but I am sure you will enjoy it if you are a hockey fan. For more information about my books, please contact me at glennliebman.com. Hope you enjoy the book!"
3,Not Half As Good as His First CD,"I have read some of the review on Javier second and found them mixed unlike the review from his first CD. He second CD has a totally different feel than his first. I found it to sound very similar to the other R&B artists I hear played on the radio endlessly that I try hard to get away from. I don't know if he took this new approach by choice or pressure from his record label to make him fit in with the young Hip Hop crowd or not. None of the songs on this CD stuck with me. I felt the CD was just put together overnight and not much thought went into this project. I listened to it based on the bass-lines and not the lycis to the songs, through I found the vocals to be very good. I would recommend it for the bass-lines ONLY."
5,"More classics from ""Wings of Desire""","There is no Nick but Nick. While there are those who feel that Nick reached his apex with the first Bad Seeds album,""From Her to Eternity,"" the opening notes of ""Your Funeral, My Trial"" are without parallel in the whole of the Nick Cave catalog. In addition, this album contains the incomparable Blixa Bargeld uttering the immortal words: ""The nag was dead meat; we can't afford to carry dead weight."" on ""The Carny."" This line is guaranteed to put many a job review into perspective. And for full-out bitter invective, there's the bonus track ""Scum"" containing some of the nastiest, most alliterative insults that one is ever likely to hear. This album is Nick: tender, kind and gentle; nasty, bitter and sardonic."
1,Incurable film.,"The Cure starring Joseph Mazzello and the late Brad Renfro left me disappointed and uninspired. The friendship between the two boys is awkward, I couldn't get into this film, the story is pretty pointless and somewhat offensive. I was hoping for a deep buddy/buddy film and I got the opposite."
1,"i like when joseph mazzello says""this tastes like crap'",i really like the whole movie verry much my favorite star is joseph mazzello
3,"Great movie, BUT.... it's full frame, NOT WIDESCREEN","Did anybody actually ordered and got the widescreen version? The description of the DVD on Amazon says it is widescreen. But I ordered it twice and both times I got the full screen version. It's really annoying.Other than that, it's one my all time favorite movie. Great cast, great performance, touching story of a true friendship."
5,The Cure movie,"Wonderful movie about people and their ignorances of other peoples situations. This is a great example to teach kids about the very real prossability of meeting different people-with different illnesses, or disabilities....and teaches about how precious everybody in your life is. I'd also recomend the movie ""Simon Birch"", which also teaches about different chalenges people have to live with. It teaches about tolerance and how everybody is the same-although different at the same time."
3,"The film is good, but...","This was a film I discovered by accident - and fell in love with. Strong performances all around, and a captivating, yet not too sentimental story line.But... Why has Universal not bothered to remaster this gem for DVD release? The sound is MONO, and the aspect ratio of the film is 1,33:1. (Full frame, not widescreen.)I know this was not a great commercial success, but I think Universal should have taken more care with this release."
5,a classic forever,This is definitly one of my all time favorites. Both lead characters do a fabulous job in their roles. A truly heart-touching story you must see.
4,The Cure,"a hard-hitting and yet warm-hearted movie about self discovery, wisdom and the pain of being alone in the world"
3,outstanding,"where do they get the kids to act in these movies. one of the best i have seen for a long time. both boys in this movie did an exceptional job. its a shame the actors in MOST of the gay movies are not even close in talent to these two. this story is a real heartbreaker and i would suggest you have the kleenex box very close for this one. i recognized one of the players as the adult child of joan crawford in the really bad movie about her life. can't remember names anymore. i highly reommend this movie to all. it is NOT a gay themed movie at all, which i thought it was when i ordered it, but is so much better than most of the gay movies they throw out the door.gary in az."
3,The Cure,"All in all it is a good movie. Except for the language, very true to live in itself. It really shows how cruel and stupid people are in general when they know nothing of the problem. Weither it be aids or how one gets it or how hard it is for people to contract it from another.The only true cure for any of our problems is Jehovah God our Creator. Many people will have there own opinions about Jehovah as with the effects of aids. But Jehovah is the creator, a God of Love not hate! Just think about how our world would be if and I mean ""IF"" everyone really learned who Jehovah is. Sincerely, JAn J Widmer Sr."
2,The cure,"This is not a movie I would like my child to see. Three reasons;1. The ""good guy"", Erik throws a big rock at the back of the head of a bully after the bully apologized, that blow could have been deadly.2. Erik steals $300 from the guys that gave them a ride.3. Dexter later cut his own hand, threatening to give them HIV to keep the stolen money.This movie could have been so much better, kids deserve better role models than that. It is however a great story about friendship no doubt."
4,Keep the tissues nearby,"This is a lovely film, sensitively directed by Peter Horton. Wonderful performances from all involved. The two young boys in this film develop a strong bond and great friendship during their summer vacation. Erik has decided he's going to find a cure for Dexter's AIDS and when he reads that a doctor has found a cure in New Orleans, they take off on a raft and head down the Mississippi on a quest to find the doctor. Their adventures on the river bring them ecen closer together. The final couple of scenes will cause you to go through a whole boxs of tissues wiping away the tears. The only misstep is some of the film seems rushed and the hospital scenes seem a bit heavy handed in places. All in all it's a lovely film."
3,One that will make you happy and sad at the same time.,"A redneck (Renfro), and an AIDS stricken boy (Mazzello), hear about a cure in Louisiana for AIDS. They set sail down the Mississippi for New Orleans. Troubles happen along the way, and they are forced to give up. Returning home ill, Mazzello is admitted into a hospital, the rest I won't tell. This is a great story about two kids, totally different, that find a link."
4,Wonderful price...decent product,"I had the mirror shipped standard so it took a while. Although it took a miracle to get it open, I am thankful it was packed so well. The mirror looks slightly different from the online photo but I expected that much. The backing of the mirror was not on well but who looks at the back? I realized the day the mirror was supposed to arrive that I had entered the wrong apartment number. I tried contacting the vendor and never received a response back. Thankfully, it arrived okay. All in all, I would order from this supplier again."
4,Good Power Metal but Not Extreme,Like SA however I'd never brag about listening to them because they are at times quite soft. It's perfect if your dog died or if you broke up with your girlfriend though.
2,more like 2.5 stars,"this one is a so-so album. its got its share of great songs and really bad numbers as well. the first part of the album is really good and reaches it peak with victoria's secret but then the quality just drops down and never gets any better... the last 2 songs are plain awful. this is a few steps down for this band, ecliptica and even silence are much better than this one"
1,Bad,"Hello!!! I am writing this email because I'm not happy with the purchase I made. I ordered the imported version of the Sonata Arctica album called ""Winterheart's Guild"". Upon receipt, I realized that the code did not match the disk drive shown in theAmazon. You sent me the Argentina of the album version and not the importedversion. This album does not match at all with the product description. The disk labelyou sent me is called ""Nems Enterprises"" and should be ""Spinefarm Records."" Also,the list of songs does not match the description of the site."
2,Easily Sonata Arctica's worst....,"Uggh, I don't know what all these other reviewers are on but this album is well below the standard of Ecliptica and Silence. The ballads on Winterheart's Guild are boring, unlike the incredibly powerful tracks on Silence like Tallulah and Sing in Silence. The fast power metal tracks don't have the energy or virtuosity of Ecliptica and there is very little 'progressive' musicianship on this album. 'The cage', 'Victoria's Secret' and 'Silver Tongue' are all good but don't even come close to older tracks like 'Black Sheep' or 'Kingdom for a Heart'. And, I didn't think it was possible but Tony Kakko's lyrics have actually gotten worse."
2,mmm not their best effort,GETS REALLY BORING AFTER JUST A FEW LISTENS TO MANY REPETITIVE TRACKS AND THE SLOW MELODYS ARE JUST PLAIN BORING ZZZZZZZZZZZ I WOULD ONLY RECOMEND THIS FOR TRUE POWER METAL FANS IF YOUR TASTES ARE NOT TO THIS KIND OF MUSIC OR JUST THAT YOUR NOT ALL THAT CRAZY FOR IT YOU'LL MOST LIKELY JUST GET BORED REAL FAST OF THIS CD LIKE I DID.
4,Really Good CD,"A really good follow up to they're previous two cd's, Tony's voice has come a long way and he bands growth is very obvious, still I don't know if I would rate it better than silence but it is defiantly a great album to own"
4,Great great stuff,"I think I liked Silence a little more than this album, but it doesn't matter, this is a band with a bright future (if the singer doesn't let his ego get out of control). The biggest improvement with this new work is the singer's english. It was pretty bad in Silence, and that had to frustrate him since he obviously wants to write coplex songs. I see no reason why Sonata Arctica won't someday rule the Metal World, or at least Europe and Japan."
3,"Good, but...","Let me start by saying that this is a pretty good CD, and if you're a fan it's going to be worth the money. Favorite songs: Abandoned, Pleased..., The Cage, and Victoria's Secret.So, why does the album only get 3 stars? Because it just doesn't draw you in like Ecliptica and Silenece. For my money, there's just nothing on Winterheart's Guild that compares to Power of One, San Sebastian, or Mary Lou. It feels like they went into the studio looking to get another album out, and that's what they did.Not to say it isn't good; it's just not up there with their first two discs."
4,They do it again,"Sonata Arctica they do it again. I dont know how they do it. It is excellent stuff! After hearing the albums Silence and Ecliptica I didnt know how this band could get any better. There awesome keyboards, the sweet smooth guitars, and the excellent vocals, I give it 4 stars. If you like Sonata Arctica i would suggest that you buy albums from bands like Hammerfall, Rhapsody, Luca Turilli, Kamelot, and other power metal bands. Excellent cd cant wait to get another Sonata Arctica cd."
3,"Disappointment after ""Silence""","I concur with the reviewer who said that this sounds like a compilation of rejected ""Silence"" tracks. There are a few good songs on it, but it isn't anywhere near as charismatic or powerful as the previous, and what's even worse, it sounds rushed. To keep it short, it isn't garbage, but I know Sonata Arctica could've done FAR better."
4,"VERY,VERY PROMISING","ONE THING YOU NOTICE RIGHT AWAY WITH SONATA ARCTICA IS THE GREAT VOCAL RANGE OF TONY KAKKO.I THINK THE SONGS THAT DO IT FOR ME MOST ARE THE FANTASTIC BALLADS.HE HAS A VOICE THAT CAN SEND CHILLS DOWN YOUR SPINE.MY MAIN PROBLEM IS THE SPEED METAL PARTS OF THE CD.IT DOSE NOT GO WITH VOCALS AS GOOD AS THIS.THEY NEED TO SCRAP THE SPEED METAL AND GO WITH JUST METAL,BECAUSE THE GUITAR WORK OF JANI LIIMATAINEN IS GREAT,BUT THE SPEED METAL PARTS SOUND CHEESY.IF THESE GUYS SCRAP THE SPEED METAL,THEY COULD BE ONE OF THE TOP BANDS OUT THERE.BUT BACK TO THIS CD,ITS VERY GOOD.NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS SILENCE BUT CLOSE.VERY WORTH BUYING."
5,New Fresh Power Metal Band,This and the previous album are worth listening and all power metal funs should try this as their songs sound fresh and new. With bands like Sonata Arctica power metal keeps on going
5,You Will Hear About Them Someday,"Easily the best thing to come out of New Jersey since Thursday, central Jersey natives Someday Never combine the catchiness of pop punk and the intensity of hardcore with die hard work ethic and an amazing stage presence that has won over audience after audience and earned them the Best Young Band award in 2004. Songs like ""To You This May Concern"" and ""Most Popular Losers"" are upbeat and energy-packed, making them instant crowd favorites. The biting lyrics and aggressive melodies on ""Goodbye To You"" and ""In The Absence Of Your Love"" make them easy to relate to and are great for those times when you hate love. With aggressive and honest vocals, insane guitar work, a talented bassist that doesn't just follow the chords, and a drummer with the skills of 5 drummers, Someday Never will be your new favorite band."
5,Amazing Upcoming Band,"Thia band, Someday Never, I think is a band that you will be hearing a lot about lately. They are a really tight band, and I think people will like that. If you are into the emocore type bands like Thursday and Thrice, I suggest you check this band out. They will bow you away."
2,Not worth it!!!!,"I really did not enjoy most of the songs in this album. Only two songs I enjoyed is ""ode to my family"" and ""zombie."" But the rest of the album just drags. There are no memorable songs that will keep you wanting to listen to the CD over and over again. I bought it and have not listen to it in over a year. I taped the two songs I liked to cassettes so I can listen to it in my car, but that's it. If you considering buying this album, don't expect anything grand. It is a slow, dreary album!!!!"
1,Ack!,"""Zom-bay, Zom-bay, Zom..BAY....""What the heck is this? This is a great composition? To each his own, I guess, but as soon as that garbage comes on the radio, I punch the radio dial immediately.I bought this CD thinking I'd give the Cranberries a try. Ehh...bad idea."
5,T-H-E B-E-S-T!,"I need more stars! c'mon..5 isn't enough.. This CD can change your life...it's just..so touching, emotional..i can't find the right words to describe this amazing CD.. I've got their first CD <Everybody else...> last year..and it was very good..i still listen to it..but ""No need to argue"" is #1...i believe it's one of the best CD's ever made."
5,Fav band Fav album,Although I love all of the cranberries albums this is my all time fav. It's a beautiful peace of art. Everytime I listen to it I get somehting new out of it and trust me I've listening to this album like a million times.
3,More of the same...,"I used to think this was the greatest album ever. And while some songs (""Ode To My Family"", ""I Can't Be With You"", ""Daffodil Lament"") are still great, others aren't, and there's an awful lot of filler. Buy this if you love the Cranberries; otherwise, check out Sinead O'Connor and The Sundays instead."
4,No Need To Argue,"The second Cranberries album is a very,very good. There are several classics on this album. I could listen to songs like I Can't Be With You, Zombie and Ridiculous Thoughts again and again.When I go into my father's car I insist on listening to the songs I've mentioned. The single reason I slightly disagree a few other Cranberries fans who rate this the band's best album is that there are a couple of songs that do not live up to the usual high standard. Their first album is more consistent so that I've rated 5 star and this album 4 star."
3,"Followup, same couch, different colored hair","""Zombie"" is a terrible vocal performance, but ""Ode To My Family"" is genuine magic. (Note to a previous reviewer: winning a grammy doesn't prove a thing these days, unfortunately. The grammies went to hell a while back.)"
5,Masterpiece,"The Cranberries never really could fit into one musical genre and that's one of the best things about them. Their music is unorthodox and so are they. Anyone looking to give them a try should know that the lead singer's voice isn't for everyone (I would compare it to you either love Bjork's voice or hate it). If you get past that, they are amazing songwriters and the lyrics are extremely powerful.I haven't heard an album by the Cranberries yet that didn't grab me on some emotional level along with being extremely special. This album is known for ""Zombie"" but there really isn't a bad track on here. Comparisons or sounds I could relate this album to are Irish folk ballads, Cocteau Twins, a little bit of My Bloody Valentine, and traditional rock. That was really reaching to throw out those categorizations.The bottom line is that you should buy this album and their other albums because they are all special in their own way."
5,EEIDSWCW was very good. This one is even better!,"Major improvement (if possible) from their first production. Best tracks: Ode to my Family, Zombie, Ridiculous Thoughts."
5,No Need To Argue is the Best,"I've been a somewhat loyal listener of the cranberries and have to say, out of the three albums that I have heard, this is #1 in my book...My all time fav is Zombie...Delores have a very unique voice and a way with words that just get to me...I would definately recommend this album to everyone..."
5,The MOST quintessential album of the nineties,"If you must own one album in this decade (the 90s) it must be the Cranberries' ""No Need To Argue."" This album is amazing. The lyrics are amazing. Dolores' voice is amazing. Each song capture a different emotion, each pure and explosive. It is no wonder this was the best-selling album of the year here in Canada, and all over the world. It is a captivating collection of beautiful ballads, rocking anthems, and dreamy love songs. BUY IT AND LOVE IT!"
4,A good album.,"This is a good album, one that you would probably put in while in a mellow sort of mood. The song that stands out to me is ""Dreaming My Dreams"" which is track 10. It is soft and wonderful and if you listen to the lyrics it can be very meaningful to you. That applies to the whole cd, too. i think that sometimes the cranberries are underrated by people (not critics, exactly). I reccomend this album and all of the other cranberries' cds."
2,"3 short stories, just ok.","I've read a lot of erotic romance, however, this one was just ok. Didn't wow me. I found the characters were not believable."
5,Confession Time,"I'd never read a book like this in my life. The only reason I did is because I know P.J.I had certain expectations before I began, but Pleasure Beach dispelled all of them.This is a book of romance that is as good as any of them."
2,Abusive Ads,"This dvd opens with a 2 minute long unskippable ad. Fast forward, menu, title -- All disabled.We don't watch it, because I have to watch the ad to be around to press play.Video content is not bad, I guess."
5,The best of Sesame Street ever!,"My toddler is learning the English alphabet with Sesame Street - Learning About Letters video. He loves Elmo and begs me to turn on Elmo's TV. It is a highly entertaining video, fun to watch (whether you are a Sesame Street fan or not) and the best of all cannot be said, it must be watched on your telly with your toddler. My little one loves Lena Horne's version of the A-B-C-D-E-F-G song and the P story. Watch and check it out!"
1,I cannot believe this is the same Sesame Street,I bought this dvd for my daughter when she was 14 months old. She picked it out at the store. We could not wait to get home to watch it. It did not even keep her attention for 3 minutes. It has no energy compared to the other Sesame Street/Elmo dvds she has. I watched it with her and found it extremely boring. I could not even make her sit through it that is how bad it was. My husband came home and watched it for himself and he agreed. I would highly encourage people not to buy this one.
4,Learning about letters,"An oldie but a goodie, this Sesame Street ABC is very entertaining for my 3 year olds (a little less so for the 6 year old, but still a fave of his). C is for cookie is an all-time favourite clip. All the letters are covered in such a variety of creative ways it keeps kids interested. A classic."
2,Low rating for the navigation,"Sesame Street has great content, but I am frustrated with the navigation issues (they are the same for many of the Sesame Street DVDs -- read reviews). You are forced to sit through commericals for Sesame Street, you can't fast forward or jump to the main menu. My toddler loses interest while I have to wait until the nav shows up to press the play button. Best to start the DVD and then wander back when you want to see it. A shame they messed it up -- the best kids DVDs go right to the menu."
5,They really do learn their letters,"My daughter loves this video. She learned her ABC's at 18 months mainly from this video and Sesame Street ABC flashcards I bought at CVS. It wasn't her mom forcing it on her, I swear! She really enjoyed the video especially the Cookie song and the Burt & Ernie La La song. I think watching it with her, interacting and singing the songs with her helped her enjoy it more which made remembering the letters easier. I have to admit I enjoyed watching it (the first 20 times!)."
3,Quality lacking,"It's all the friends we know and love but the quality of certain scenes of this DVD are grainy and lacking. My 2 yr old doesn't mind of course. Don't expect much Elmo, mainly Big Bird and every other character."
1,Forced to Watch Commercials!,"My 3 year old loves this video. It's entertaining and very clever. It also has some priceless vintage footage I remember when I watched Sesame St. 5 Stars! Especially when compared to the new Sesame St. The new productions of Sesame St. are horrible! Long, complex, conveluted scripts that do nothing to promote learning. Yes, 5 star video, but unfortunately, they lose 4 stars for forcing us to watch a commercial for the Childrens Television Workshop at the start of the video. There's no way to skip it, fast-foward or go to Menus... All commands are blocked until the commercial runs its course. OK, I'm sure it's a worthy cause, but I purchased the rights to this video, so I should not be forced to watch their ad. I've had to sit through it countless times! I get it! Now let me have the ability to skip it if I want!!! BTW, same issue with ""Learning About Numbers"""
4,Great Video - just wish it were a DVD!,My 15 month old son loves this video. I just wish it were available in DVD format.
3,not what i expected,"I bought this because my daughter LOVES elmo and thought it would be fun and bright like the current elmo videos we own. Although the video does contain some classic SS scenes and feel that reminds me of my childhood, the quality of the picture is duller and less engaging. I would recommend going with another video."
2,"Excellent topic, but poor research done by author.","As a great fan of LeAnn Rimes, I have to say I found this biography more than a little disappointing. I discovered absolutely no information on her that couldn't be found in the most superficial interviews she has given. Since reading it I have also learned, from a interview with LeAnn herself, that not only was she not consulted in the writing of this book, the author did not even bother to interview her! It was based primarily on past interviews conducted by other writers. I you have absolutely no knowlege of LeAnn you might enjoy this book, otherwise I recommend passing it over."
5,The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation,"Blunt and incisive. Compassionate yet objective. GodfreyMwakikagile has a written a book that may become standardtext in comparative studies. It is also a diagnostic manual,and a prescription, for what ails the world's most embattled continent.Anyone who cares about Africa, and anyone whowants to go and live or work in Africa, should read ""TheModern African State: Quest for Transformation."" That, byitself, is a transforming experience, and as memorable asit is instructive."
5,One of the best CDs in my collection,This may be Wobble's best CD. I've probably played this as much as any CD I own. Wobble is one of the greats of the last two decades!!
3,"Get the facts right, this DVD has the Uncut version.","Again, unfortunately someone has been jumping the gun and accusing every DVD released in America to be cut. Usually a warning is apropriate, as foreign films are often cut, however, you should know whether or not that's true before you write a bad review. Not only does this film have both the original dialogue/ uncut version & the english dubbed(on one double-sided disc), but it lists it right in the features above. Please do your research or at least read the description before you continue to make these harsh allegations.That being said, the audio and video quality on this DVD is very poor. The other R1 version by Tai Seng is the 22 minutes shorter cut, so avoid that one. So, region free player? Hong Kong Legends version, if not, either this one, or some cheaper HK import that will probably also have subpar quality."
4,Chan's the man!,"I have only seen parts of this, but plan on getting it very soon. Found it intesting that it contains Subbed and Dubbed versions. Subbed is 126 minutes and dubbed is 106, what gives?Anyway I'll be watching the SUBBED version."
3,good but subtitled,i didnt know the movie was not going to be englished dubbed. But i am kinda used to reading the subtitles now...so it is not that bad. Other than the fact it is in chinese it is not that bad
5,Great film but better off getting the uncut version instead!,"I don't know why many foreign films that get into the US market wind up getting cut, especially Jackie Chan ones. I own the original uncut letterboxed subtitled version of this movie put out years back by Taiseng video. It's so much better. At least the DVD is uncut. I hope more people get the DVD version of this movie instead of VHS in this case. You'll be getting a better run for your money."
3,Black Dragon,"This is another of Jackie Chan's early movies. It doesn't even sound like Jackie Chan. The movie action was slow and at time silly. I love Jackie Chan movies, but I'm afraid this one is at the bottom of my list."
2,Not very helpful at all!,"In a nut shell, this book says to look at nutrition labels and eat any and all things high in fat. Bacon, whole milk, red meat, etc. Sounds like the way to achieve heart disease rather than gain weight. I was very disappointed!"
4,His First All-Studio Double-LP Now On CD!,"With a Monster like the title cut to contend with, it made sense to capitalize on it with a major release, and here it was and is. Although the tired cliche ""It would have made a GREAT single album"" does apply, there are four exceptionally fine ballads which sound even greater 28 years later: ""Your Love Was Good For Me"" (also a 1968 Marva Whitney recording which should have been a smash single); ""Nothing Beats A Try But A Fail"" and two Sammy Lowe-related ballad recuts ""Lost Someone"" and ""I Know It's True"" (aka ""I Found Someone""),the latter originally left off the domestic issue. The remainder are very well-produced and are still required listening."
5,Twelve minutes,"James Brown isn't really considered in terms of the studio albums he recorded; as another reviewer pointed out, the average CD with his name on it is a collection of hit singles, rather than an organized, preconceived single album.I can't imagine why this is the case, since every studio album I've heard from him is excellent, especiallyThere It IsandHell, but most of all this one, 'Get on the Good Foot', my personal favorite, which features a twelve minute version of his signature ballad, 'Please, Please, Please', involving Mr Brown narrating part of his life story and singing snippets of songs from his own favorite artists.'The Whole World Needs Liberation' and 'The Funky Side of Town' are other highlights."
4,Very Strong,James Brown Grooves on this Set.The Title Cut Alone is a Classic.Hearing His Sense OF Rhythm is Amazing Because He did these Grooves 30 Years back.His Production was so far ahead Of It's Time.You Feel The Genius&Depth that is The Godfather.
4,Good book .. but nigh identical Chilton manual is better.,"I have always bought Haynes manuals for every car I've owned. In addition to getting this manual from Amazon, I also checked the Chilton manual out of my local library. To my amazement, they were the same book. I didn't know one company had bought the other. Pictures and text were identical. Layout in the Chilton manual was better in that it was easier to find and read information quickly.So I guess for my next car I'll be going with a Chilton book, even though the content will be the same."
1,utter trash,"Both taps and dies are poorly machined, with a near complete lack of precision. They are also illegibly labeled, and, at times, incorrectly labeled (I have 2 dies which read M10 1.5, but, looking at them, they are clearly different). Taps are inconsistent, some appear to be made to cut sharp edges into threads, others are very rounded, and still others will only cut for the first centimeter of the 3cm cutting part of the tap.I should've returned this, but didn't do so in a timely enough fashion. This is a warning to anyone thinking about buying this set, if you want usable tools, look elsewhere."
1,terrible set!,I have purchased that set and i m very disappointed. Very BAD quality of all metal parts. In fact I will use only blastic box. I strictly advice DO NOT buy it
3,Not good quality,I bought this to tap a few holes with metric threads and I did get it done but it is poor quality as you would expect form the price. I recommend you spend more and get a set that will be useful in the future not just a one time solution. No better than I expected
1,Garbage,"Dont waste your time. sometimes I think to myself, yeah cheap tools might work out ok. most of my stuff is quality but I have a few things in there that are hand me downs that are just cheap stuff but still work. I dont know why I thought that a cheap tap and die set would be worth it. stupid me. I had better luck cleaning up a thread making a cut in a bolt with a cut off wheel and hitting it with a file."
4,works great,shipped quickly and works great.. too bad my battery can't hold a charge anymore.. stay away from sandisk.. i've had battery issues with them on more than one occassion.Laura
4,Works great,I wanted tomething for when I went away or did not have a computer to charge it with the USB. It works great and keeps me in the music.
3,not bad.,"I just wish they could make easier brush to clean.I like it because is flexible and i can use under refrigerator, sofas, dryer etc."
3,OK but not that flexible,"I've been looking for a very flexible tool to clean under my fridge & around the coils. I checked the local vacuum repair shop and he had something similar to this for half the price but I wanted the tool more flexible. So I ordered the actual Dyson product and it is no better as far as the flexibility factor. This product is ok and I will use it for cleaning other areas in my house & car, but it still didn't meet my total needs."
3,OK but doesn't bend as much as I anticipated,This really isn't worth the price: It works OK but it's hard to manipulate (pulling the inner section out of the hard shell would be impossible without strong fingers and hands) and it doesn't concentrate the power like a true crevice tool as the opening is too big.I bought it for the car but maybe it will work better for a dryer vent or something like that.
2,Doesen't Suck... REALLY,"KIND-of gets the job done in the car, BUT suction seems to be cut WAY down with this attached. A straight, one-piece, narrower device would work much better.We own the hand-held & upright Dysons, & assumed that since they were SO well thought-out in their construction & operation, that this would be too. It's quite the opposite."
1,how the heck?,"how the heck is this thing supposed to work? I can't figure out whats flexible about it..it looks just like the one that comes with the vacuum (which, by the way, I absolutely love)...this attachment looks like there's something down inside, and from these pictures I gather its supposed to pull out and be the flexible part, but I sure can't figure out how to pull it out...maybe mine's just stuck..."
3,Too flexible,"I'm using this tool unextended mostly. It's a little longer than the crevice tool that came with my DC21 canister, so it works for some uses. The flexible part is too floppy and kinks shut if bent too far. Also the little brush for the end is almost worthless. Get a little cat fur in it, and it clogs instantly and is difficult to unclog. I took the brush off. I don't understand why the Dyson crevice tools have holes in the opening. It would seem to me that dust would blow right out. I emailed them, got a canned reply that they'd get right back to me, and never heard from them again."
2,"Not as advertised. ONLY 24"" LONG, and only 20 1/2"" is flat","I ordered this item specifically to be able to clean out a floor furnace. I needed a 36"" reach and it is not 36"" so if you really need a 36"" crevice tool this will not solve your problem. The round part at the top which connects to the vacuum is 3 1/2"" which leaves only 20 1/2"" of flat tool to get into tight places. I really wish people would be honest about their products. It isn't 36"" just because you wish it were. If it is a 24"" tool, then just say so, people. Somebody at Dyson did a poor job if they didn't bother to measure before sending out specs on this item. I have seen it advertised as 36"" on other sites, so I don't think it is an error on the Amazon end, but who knows. Somebody somewhere did not do his or her job."
2,name is deceiving,it says 36 but it is only 24 inches long not 36 inches. so I have no idea what the 36 is suppose to mean. not worth the 20.00
1,Vacuum extension,"I have owned the mini hand held dyson for 4 years , I love the vacuum but the extension they sell for 27.00 is a joke. after hooking it up , it does not suck much stuff up, like small pieces of dog food. My short original hard plastic extension works great. There are to many leaks between the bristols and the vacuum and it loses 3/4 of its power , I returned it. And i use my original shorter hard plastic with a skinny nose on it and it works great. I own 2 dyson vacuum ball and 2 Hand Helds they work great"
3,Works ok,I bought it to use it for hard to reach areas in my car. It works ok. The flexible part of it slides in when you try to use it in tight areas. I was mainly disappointed with the suction power of my Dyson vacuum cleaner. It does not pick up hair or anything that tends to stick to the carpet.
5,Just what I was looking for my Dyson handheld D34,My D34 is so convenient that since I bought it I almost never use the big vacuum cleaner. This extension is just what I needed to keep my back straight! I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews. I actually prefer that is not that flexible but still lets you reach difficult places. Construction is sturdy and high quality. The fit to my handled is perfect and it comes with a separate connection that I assume is for bigger models. One other thing I really like is that I can remove the tip and use the extension without it (I found it better for picking crumbs from sofas and the hardwood floor).
1,not as practical as i've imagined.,"it's hardly as malleable as this picture suggests.also, leaks air from every inch. not up to the dyson name and price tag.and ticker then the original, short, slim end attachment."
2,KIDDE Smoke detectors,"I purchased six KIDDE i5000 smoke detectorsFirex/Kidde i5000 Hardwire Ionization Smoke Alarm with Battery Backupand had them installed by an electrician. However after the installation, I found out that I was shipped the KIDDE i4618 smoke detectors instead. What a bummer. The box states Seriesi5000 then in ""small"" print on the back of the box it states model#i4618."
5,Firex 5000 smoke alarms,"My smoke alarms were over 10 years old and I decided to replace them (6 of them). I was happy with the smoke alarms sent to me and they were offered at a good price. My only negative comment would be that I was charged shipping for each of the items even though they were sent altogether in one box! In other words, I was charged over $30 shipping for a rather small box that held 6 smoke alarms! There's something wrong with that."
5,"If you need it, get it.","Looks like the old model, but different mounting plate and connector. Not really a problem, plate screws into the same holes as the old one, cut the old wires and splice in the new ones - remember, ONE at a time, not all three at once."
4,Needed to buy additional adapter,Needed to see pictures of connector. If I had I could have ordered the necessary adapter on the same order instead of placing an additional order later. Kidde alarms do not fit Firex outlets!
5,Fast and easy install,Purchase four of these as part of a set to replace existing 10 year old units. The quick connect harness made things very quick and easy to install. The front loading battery compartment is convenient and helps make the unit look nice and unique.
1,unresponsive,"I thought I was purchasing the Brad Paisley CD with this song on it. Unfortunately it was a Karaokeversion of the music and lyrics. The CD had been opened and had a scratch on it. I called the phone number listed for the sender 7 times. Each time only received a recording and I left a message toplease call me as I was dissatisfied with the purchase. Alas, I never received any response. I also e-mailed them but again, no response.This is very poor from a proclaimed ""Christian Company""."
2,Just use the exercise info that comes with the ball,"I'm just starting out on the ball but even so, I think this is a joke of a workout. I gave it 2 stars because it did give me 1-2 extra moves that the stability ball info did not. But I recommend just using the exercises that come with the ball. They do a great deal more than this video does."
3,"good, but only for the very out of shape who also happen to have good balance","I love Leslie and her workouts, and while I do enjoy this workout, I need to use it for the lighter days when I don't really feel like a workout. I workout moderatly everyday, and the majority of which are Leslie videos. This just leaves me lacking something. Like I didn't get a good workout. The only good workout I get from this video is from laughing so hard as I try to keep my balance on the ball on the side crunches. That part takes some balance that I just don't have!"
4,Leslie Makes It Easy!,"After purchasing my stability ball, I attempted to do the exercises printed on the instruction manual. I gave up quickly because the exercises seemed too difficult for a beginner. I am a big fan of Leslie's other walking videos, so I decided to give this one a try. True, it's not the most challenging, but it's a great place to start if you're a beginner to stability ball exercise."
3,"Great for beginners, but not much of a challenge","I bought this video mainly because I love Leslie's Walk Away the Pounds series and wanted to add some strength training using a stability ball. The instruction is simple and clear, but the workouts are not as challenging as I had hoped. The instructional portion of the video is ~15 minutes long, leaving only 21 minutes for the ""Core Workout"" and the ""Challenge Workout."" Like many of Leslie's tapes, she gives you modifications to make the moves more challenging...I could do them the very first time through. I think this tape would be great for someone who is new to exercise, but I'll need something more strenuous to keep building my fitness level."
2,Disappointed,I'm a HUGE fan of Leslie's walking DVDs and videos. This one was pretty much a waste of time. There was no challenge to this very short workout. All of the exercises could be done (perhaps more efficiently) without the ball. There are far better stability ball workouts on the market.
3,hard cotton,"I like the price, prompt shipment, and packaging. what I don't like is the cotton tip is not soft enough, feels like the glue was bleached out to the surface. I don't think it is suitable for delicate work like cleaning the video heads of a camcorder."
5,Buyer,We saved a bunch of money on this purchase...these were actually used in our FA Lab - much cheaper than to buy from our regular supplier at nearly 40% more!
2,Not what I expected,"I bought these as they were labelled as sterilized, as stated in their product information:""Sterilized cotton tipped swabs are ideal for cleansing, removal of debris and for applying topical medications""What I received was the swabs sent in an un-sealed, zip-lock bag. These were received on time as expected, but I specifically purchased them because they were supposed to be sterile. Since I can used them for painting or other purposes, I've given 2 stars, otherwise it would have been 1."
2,slob swabs,I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THESE WERE NOT STERIL. EVEN PETS DESERVE TO BE GROOMED WITH CLEAN PRODUCTS I'LLONLY USE THESE WITH ALCOHOL ON THEM.
5,rp7mf is way off,"owned this album for years and still can't stop listening to it.everytrack is good, definatly his best work.stay away from angels with dirty faces which is a completly different album.angels really dissapoints..."
3,WACK,"There are only 2 good tracks on this album: 1 BLACK STEEL which has Tricky's girlfriend reciting a portion of CHUCKY D'd Public Enemy Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos. 2. I'm BRAND NEW you are RETRO, very good but way too short. The rest is too weird and therefore WACK."
2,Hmmm...,"Now THIS is weird. REALLY weird. In fact, I'd go so far and call it the ""The Velvet Underground and Nico"" of our generation. Okay. Tricky, onetime Massive Attack rapper, teams up with gravelly-voiced singer Martine, and makes one of the weirdest albums you'll ever hear. I'm sitting here staring at the keyboard trying to explain what it sounds like and I'm unsuccessful. Some call it ""trip-hop"" but I say this sounds NOTHING like ""Dummy"" or ""Mezzanine""! Ever heard the song ""Downs"" from Big Star's ""Third Sister Lovers""? That's what a lot of this album sounds like. Unique percussion and static melodies. And lyrics along the lines of ""I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless"" and ""I f--- you in the a--."" with song titles like ""Ponderosa"" and ""Suffocated Love"". Pot hallucination experiences put on record, I guess. It's all very VERY surreal.It's also very VERY unlistenable. But hey, so was ""The Velvet Underground And Nico""!"
3,"Something like it, but not really..","The flow of the piece itself expelled alot of talent, and Im sure took alot of time and energy. Though to completely glorify this album at all, would not be my own doing. Tricky's work has been compared to Massive Attack and Portishead. Maybe MA has a flow like Trickys recent work, but cant be even be compared to an album like Portisheads' ""Dummy"" album. This album, Maxin-something or another, has alot of work to do. Maybe a good remix, or maybe ten of them, would help. I only give it three stars, because I couldnt do what he does, but I think Im just in a polite mood tonight. So if you like a good sensual electronic flow, MA and Portishead will have to do you. Tricky is too wanna-be Deltron3030 mixed with a bad breakbeat/trance album."
1,HI,"Why can't people be innovative? It is no coincidence that this album came out right after Portishead's ""Dummy"""
1,this is very childish,"How can people stand listening to this music without being embarassed? I mean, what would your parents think? This is very boring and is only good for making love."
2,slow and monotonous,"tricky laid out a number of great tracks when he was with massive attack. this solo work shows he needs the influence of the other massive members to provide diversity and listenability to his music. in my opinion, there's only one good track on the album ""abbaon fat track."" the others are just one slow monotonous song that makes one quickly realize they just wasted [money]."
3,Retains a certain chilled edge,"3 1/2Although my involvement in this trip-hop classic has trailed off a bit over the years, many tracks, especially in the latter half, remain undeniably intoxicating and prove there was such a time when the artist was producing visionary material."
4,Dark and lucious,'Overcome' is a really good track. Listen to it and if you like it then buy this album. It is worth it. Dark beats with smooth vocals.
4,Aethereal Thunder,"Nebulous indeed, this album is a flash of insight. The thundering bass is well balanced by the lightning streams of Maxine's well placed voice. Clearly this is at the top of my list."
4,good stuff,"Check out a Public Enemy cover of ""Black Steel"" and track ""Hell is just around the corner"". The entire album is good over all."
2,Fire and Bronze... a poor book,"This book is replete with spelling errors, eg heal when heel is meant; beech when beach is meant to name a couple. The author repeatedly uses the word ""prone"" when what he is describing is the opposite, supine. These things, as well as the use of phoenician words through the text, were a distraction. I did finish the book, but many times I picked it up to read it out of boredom. The book needed a proof reader, and it is hard for me to believe that some of these errors slipped by an editor. Not worth the $24.95 hard cover price"
1,"incomplete kit, seller misled in description",This was suppose to be an aromatherapy kit with essential oils included. No oils were included wished I had known this would have not ordered it. Tried contacting seller about this and had no response. Will not buy from this seller again!! I guess I need to email amazon about this complaint since seller never responded and see what can be done. This book as some good basic information about essential oils and a few recipes that are suppose to cover the oils that came with it. If looking for basic information and a few recipes this would be a good starter. Wished it had more recipes and bigger book. Also wished for better customer service and a complete aromatherapy kit which neither I got.
4,Noteworthy!,"Dear prospective listeners (and buyers!), be aware that the ""Satchmo-influenced singer"" that Jake Pegg of PDX is referring to is none other than the legendary Rock-and-Roll Hall of Famer and Godfather of Go-Go himself...Mr. Chuck Brown of Washington, DC! This CD is a labor of love for indigenous American music, especially of the New Orleans variety. What makes it deliciously ironic is that it was recorded in rural Maryland, and it kicks like a mule with a toothache! Get this, roots people, you won't go wrong..."
1,does not last,I finally gave up after my 3rd one went bad.I really liked the knife with the feel and quick blade change. And I had bought a large supply of their blades. Also a standard stanley blade will not fit these knifes. But the little stubs that hold the blade in wear out real fast. I do not use them every day and got about 6 months out of each one. I would say it would hold up to about 1 or 2 hours of sheetrock use. They may last if only cutting cardboard but nothing else.With a higher price it will not even last as long as the cheap ones. Matter of fact I have never worn out a utility before these.
2,Great handling knife....but didn't last,"As others have mentioned other blades don't fit properly. Knife has a flimsy retracting thumb slide, mine broke after about three weeks. A buddy of mine warned me when I bought it, he said he went through a few of them. I shoud have listened to him, besides my stanley knife has never failed me."
5,A must-have for any ancient Chinese studies student,"Can be complicated and difficult to read, so take your time. You won't regret it."
4,Never seen this one before....,"I just happened upon this movie tonight and have not watched it all yet so I don't have review. I never heard of this movie until tonight and was surprised to see what had to be an original of the movie ""Young at Heart"" with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day. I have always loved the YaH version and am anxious to see this one......I only wish it was on DVD so I could share it with my mother who is a classic movie devotee!"
4,Westerns,"If you like westerns than you will like this book. It is a western about a girl named Lona who has lived on a ranch with a man she asumed was her father. One night a strange man shows up just outside the boundry of the ranch. Everyone knows him as the ""Black Rider"". He knows who Lona's real father is. I reccomend this book because it makes you curious."
4,Stubborn ruler throws away everything,"for no real purpose in this excellent account of Swedish military glory. Yes Sweden. Boy King Charles manages to win virtually every battle but messes up everything else. There lies the reason Peter is called "" The Great "" while he remains Charles the 12th. Clear vivid account of the men and the times it shows how Sweden declines as Russia emerges."
2,Save you money,This book helped me understand how my home worked and now I'll know what to tell my contractors what I want and how much to spend. This book is a money saver.
4,A moving account of the doomed Burke and Wills expedition.,"In 1860 the Victorian Exploration Expedition, under the command of Robert O'Hara Burke, set out from Melbourne to cross Australia to the Gulf of Carpenteria and to explore the unknown centre of the continent. Burke, and his second-in-command William J. Wills, achieved their goal of crossing the continent, opening up a vast new area of Australia. But the expedition ended in disaster, with the death from starvation of both Burke and Wills at Cooper's Creek. This book tells the story of the expedition from the historical context and initial planning, to the events of the expedition itself, to the proceedings of the Royal Commission that investigated the expedition's disasterous end. A moving story well written."
3,"Amazing story, however, not very readable","As a patient and understanding reader, this was a good story. However, I don't feel that the book was easy to read and was slightly boring. By saying this, I'm not saying I did not enjoy learning about the expedition of brave men traversing the Australian continent. In many ways, this is a devastating story. It's sad and true. Unless you are an avid Australian history researcher, it will be very difficult to utilize any of the information from this story. Keep that in mind before attempting to purchase this book."
5,Extreme Guitarist,"I was ecstatic upon discovering this top quality live recording of such an extreme guitarist. Melding the influences of classical, jazz, flamenco and gospel, John Scott Evans is the rising star of fingerstyle guitar. If you like Earl Klugh, Chet Atkins and Doyle Dyks, you'll love the artistry of John Scott Evans. This performance with his six-piece band, also features David Ragsdale (Kansas) on violin. Website: johnscottevans(dot)com"
1,Run Away! TERRIBLE!,"My HP PSC 1610 Printer rejected this cartridge and would never work properly again so I had to buy a new one and throw out the entire printer!(some savings, ha!) I could not find the HP brand cartridges on this site and now buy the HP brand ink exclusively, and elsewhere."
4,Slayers Is Way Past Cool (From Phenox08),"The funny thing is I saw Slayers By Axodent. some kid was watching it over My schools Distant Learning Lab Tv and I got to watch it for my study hall. After that I was Hooked. This is the Greatest Anime Ever (Next to Sailor Moon Of Course) I plan on getting all the videos. And I suggest you do to They great, Enertaining, and Funny. I just Love Amelia, She's Funny and Clumsy But Keeps on going, and dosen't Zel and Amelia make a cute couple :) Trust me on this This Anime is a Defined MUST BUY. :)"
2,"A very poular series, but less then perfect ...","If you are looking for charming characters, but love a lack of storytelling, drawing ability, animation skill, or central planning...then THIS series is for YOU! Lina, the ultra sorceress of an alternate universe, slums around and attracts more fellow travellers then troubles. This first series is a single story in some ways, but gets confused and lost in minutia. Lina and company are great to watch, but the action sequnces and designs are less then thrilling, however the humor is quite good (the kissing fish episode was really memorable). The side kicks pile on as the creator decides he doesn't know what he wants to write about, or how to make decent character interaction with a minimal cast. I purchased these videos as they came out and thought of them as cheap comic books- view once and put in a closet for eternity. Entertaining, yes, but not engaging or skillful. This series is probably best appreciated by the pre-pubescent anime fan."
5,Excellent,The story of Ishmael is one of my new favorites and will become required reading by all in my household. It is rare to find book with as much refined and spectacular character development as Ishmael's. This book encouraged me to take a closer look at my own life and character. I highly recommend reading these excellent books.
5,Very Nice Picture,"This picture is astounding. They shipped it unrolled, which I like because it keeps the product crisp and without folded marks. I framed it in an old driftwood frame and it looks wonderful in my husband's office! Our favorite lighthouse print so far!"
3,Good for beginners,"This is standard Sesame Street, pre-Elmo. Big Bird is the host of a game show that introduces numbers through clips and songs. My little one doesn't seem to like thistape, she wanders from the TV whenever it's on but for the child of the '70's this is the tape to have from the king in the castle to the martian girl."
2,A huge disappointment...,"I grew up watching Sesame Street and truly love the Muppets. However, I have to say this video was not what I expected. There were some great vintage clips, but not enough muppets/monsters for me. This video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing. I would recommend you pass on this one and get ""123 Count With Me"" instead."
3,Learning about numbers,"This video contains some great number cartoons. Too muchemphasis on the late show format and other ""plot""elements. (Big bird's song about the number 4 may bring back fond memories, but it doesn't teach much) My 2 year-old consistently loses interest in this video after about 10 minutes."
2,Liers!!........Amazon says both languages (spanish & english),"It is only in english.Amazon, try not to do this again.You better fix that info on the item page."
1,Forced to Watch Commercials!,"My 3 year old loves this video. It's entertaining and very clever. It also has some priceless vintage footage I remember when I watched Sesame St. 5 Stars! Unfortunately, they lose 4 stars for forcing us to watch a commercial for the Childrens Television Workshop at the start of the video. There's no way to skip it, fast-foward or go to Menus... All commands are blocked until the commercial runs its course. OK, I'm sure it's a worthy cause, but I purchased the rights to this video, so I should not be forced to watch their ad. I've had to sit through it countless times! I get it! Now let me have the ability to skip it if I want!!!"
2,not what we expected,"Ordered this for my 2 year old. I didn't realize it was only about the number 2. I thought it was learning about numbers, part 2 and would involved numbers one through 10. So perhaps this was my mistake. Gets a bit tedious. My 2 year old got bored with it, because he also expected it to cover other numbers."
3,Average product...,"While I like what Sesame Street does for children's television and education, this video falls short. The recycled number segments have been intertwined into a regular Sesame Street episode and thrown together, packaged and sold. My child is almost two and has a strong attention span, but she would lose interest a quarter to half way though the video. While watching the video with her, I believe some of the segments are odd to borderline creepy. LeapFrog vids are a worthy investment."
2,Low rating for the navigation! :(,"Sesame Street has great content, but I am frustrated with the navigation issues (they are the same for many of the Sesame Street DVDs -- read reviews). You are forced to sit through commericals for Sesame Street, you can't fast forward or jump to the main menu. My toddler loses interest while I have to wait until the nav shows up to press the play button. Best to start the DVD and then wander back when you want to see it. A shame they messed it up -- the best kids DVDs go right to the menu."
5,The real history of things!,This is a powerful and mind explosive book. It should be taught in schools and college as the real history of things.
1,Misleading Content,"I had heard that Cottage Cheese and flaxseed oil have been successfully used to treat cancer. I bought this book expecting that there'd be at least a chapter on Cottage Cheese, Flaxseed Oil, and Cancer including discussions on why it's believed to help. I also expected similar chapters on other simple, everyday things that might help.But it's less than 50 pages and reads more like one man's journal at a very high level. There was really only one paragraph on Cottage Cheese, and it basically only mentioned that he heard about it and added it to his diet. And that was probably the most detailed part of the book."
5,Exactly what it claims,"The book claims to be one man's experience in dealing with, and conquering, cancer... and that is exactly what it is. How refreshing to have a laypersons practical experiences. There are great resources available from doctors and nutritionists, but few real people writing about real experiences."
4,A fun read!!,A fun and well-written story that certainly holds your interest. I would recommend this book to all who enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey.
2,Trite,"While the poems in this book are wonderful, the commentary by Housden is just too syrupy. I was expecting more of a discussion on the poems themselves rather than a look into the author's personal life. This book is more of an exposition of how these poems have meaning to the author."
3,Witch Doctor in a Tuxedo,"Nick Cave is a man who has inspired extremes of loyalty. Held to be a Messiah of Goth during his Birthday Party years in the early '80s, his career as singer-poet with Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds has followed a perverse and fascinating path. From a demented witch-doctor of Australian rock he has become a lovesick crooner of unexpected tenderness.Kicking Against The Pricks, was an important blood-stained milestone in this progress. On this record, the singer acknowledged his influences with a collection of covers as exhilarating as they are eccentric. His rendering of the likes of Hey Joe, The Singer and All Tomorrow's Parties might not be to everybody's taste, but in its own way it's as affectionate a tribute as Elvis Costello's country album Almost Blue."
3,Good book for school,My wife needed the book for her studies in college and sometimes I helped her understand this book. It got me interested as well in some of the topics
1,The most boring piece of crap you will ever read..........,"I had to buy this overly expensive book for a undergraduate college level Philosophy class.The text book is a series of articles written by different authors.Most of the articles are full of nonsensical Orwellian double speak, that you have to translate into plain English to understand.The authors could have made their points using sufficiently clear, concise, plain English, and by using concrete examples in 5 to 10 pages per article.Instead the authors go on and on for 20 or 30 pages per article about absolutely nothing.I guess the more words the authors write and the more the high falutin language they use, the more intelligent they seem.In reality, they are just wasting people's time.I feel sorry for any student that is forced to read this book.It is pure torture to get through.............."
2,Book delivery review,Product discribed as is. Item received 3 weeks after the original date purchased. Takes more than 2 weeks to received an order. Vendor is good.
2,Boring enough to put you to sleep!,"In my opinion, the book is long (2 columns per page and small font), some things are repeated or over-explained and definitely not in lamens terms. I was so bored reading this book that my stomach begin to twist in knots. I also believe the author was very anxious to show off their vocabulary. It may be a little more interesting if it was a little more down to earth instead of using sentences such as ""As in all such masculine invocations of original perfection, Eve has vanished."" Every once and a while, I got interested in some of the topics. Other than that, if it werent for a class that I needed this for, I would not have bought this."
4,Excellent resource for board review.,"The OMT Review by Savarese is a ""must have"" for Osteopathic Medical students. I bought this book close to the end of my second year to help me study for ""boards"" and I wish I would have bought it sooner.It would have been a GREAT resource throughout my first two years of school. The book is concise and complete in the knowledge a student will need to do well on OMT course exams as well as the COMLEX Board exams."
1,OMT used review,The study guide arrived with nearly every page marked up and all of the questions were answered...not a useful study guide. Returned with no problems and the seller was very apologetic.
2,Not good,I wanted to throw throw this French junk away after watching it. I don't know why I bought it after I read the other reviews.
1,Maybe I missed the bateau,"I'm not sure this movie was about anything except an event where the dead mysteriously reappear. At the end of the movie, you are still left with the same questions you had at the begining."
1,Not a Zombie movie!,"Rob Zombie would be appalled. Ok I'm a zombie movie fan, but not an action movie fan and I don't like crappy movies. Don't think i'm some gore-fest fan that only likes movies with exploding heads. I like interesting innovative movies, or atleast a different take on the classic movie (such as Shawn of the Dead). The premise for They Came Back had great potential. A ""zombie"" movie were the dead could integrate into society. Lots of possibilities in the relationship area. This movie was unbelivably boring and long. The ""Zombies"" just act like they are really stoned. Character development is extremely thin and not at all compelling. The resolution / climax was confusing and non existant. As other reviewers pointed out, none of the critical questions were addressed, let alone awnsered. They need to re-word the promotional sonopsis on the box because it is extremely misleading."
4,A great intro on how to understand the Bible.,"This book is great for anyone who desires to grow in their ability to read the Bible the way it wants to be read. If you desire to really understand what ""thus sayeth the LORD"", you've got to learn what the Bible says about itself. ""Let the Reader Understand"", will get you started on that journey. It tackles complex material in a very understandible way. The Authors are great communicators! Learn more about how to learn about the one true God! Peace....."
3,Complicated but good repeat,"I agree with Jeffery, so I won't retype his post, but this is a good book, but would not recommend it to a beginner or someone who is a bottom line, to the point guy"
5,Local H's Debut,This is the H's heaviest album yet. Much different that Pack up the Cats or Good as dead but stick to ya the same way
5,Rock at its finest!,"Call yourself a rock fan? You had better have this gem in your collection. Check it out above and then put it in your shopping cart and buy it. You won't be disappointed. Standout tracks : ""Manipulator"" ""Chicago FanPhair"", and my fave, ""User"""
1,Lacking oem features,"Just used the Purolator C35479 in my Avalon and found it to be lacking in the comparison of the oem filter. Oem had foam rubber on sides to stop air from getting around filter and the oem was reinforced with a fiber mesh for strength. Compared to the oem, the C35479 should have cost half as much, for the 22.00 cost from dealer, I will try to plan ahead and get a Toyota filter next time. Its a lot of work to replace and I want a better filter next time."
1,Not for ES350,The Amazon.com web site said the this cabin air filter would fit a 2009 Lexus Es350. The filter had to be cut to fit the frame and was not as thick as recomended by Lexus. It did work but probably will not last as long because of the reduced thickness
1,fantastic album,"Well I read the review from Bordersj2 and felt I had to respond. I don't think Bordersj2 really understands what this CD is all about - I've got it (had it about 6 months now) and I play it all the time. This is the perfect cd to have around when you've got friends over. I looked at bordersj2's other reviews and it looks like he/she is a brazilian dj of some sort and obviously bitter about not being able to do the cd themselves. What the review doesn't talk about is that a good song is a good song. Just becasue a song is a couple of years old doesn't make it a bad song - can you imagine if we held this standard up to The Beatles, Rolling Stones or Led Zepelin ? This Cd is great because it creates the mood I'm looking for, i don't care if the songs are 35 years old (I'm 35 years old - am i past my expiration date too ?)"
1,"Musically sound, technically inept.","Suncomm Media Max anti piracy limits the usefullness of the CD. You cannot play it on a PC without installing their software. Ripping the CD tracks to your PC so you can load them onto your ipod, or other portable media device will not work since the tracks come out garbled.As long as you are only planning on playing the CD in your car or home CD player you will be fine. For me, it is like purchasing a musical paperweight, since my Car, Home and portable MP3 players can't be used.This goes for all of the Kinkysweet CD's. Bar Grooves, Frequent Flyer etc."
1,"Nice music, shame about the piracy protection","It may be true that the music is outdated and unoriginal but for those who are uninitiated into the nu-bossa scene like myself then the CDs provide some pleasant enough tunes.But the real bummer comes from the piracy protection. Impossible to play the CD on your PC without installing MediaMax's programme, and even then you can only listen when the CD is in the machine... so no copying to your computer, transfering to iPod or the likes. Surely with the rise of MP3, MediaMax will have to change this ridiculous anti-piracy protection else all their CDs will be relegated to dusty shelves and never heard."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"... It's not only bad. It's annoyingly bad. Some bad movies make you laugh. This makes you want to throw your tv out the window. It's full of every hip hop cliche you can think of. And I like hip hop. It's just a gangsta video fantasy made into a feature film. A lot of rap artists are in it (ones I like too, like B-Real and MC Eiht). But it makes no attempt to be more than a genre film, and a bad one at that. You want to watch a good urban gangster style movie? Check out Fresh or Ghost Dog, or even Menace to Society. Those are artistic movies. Anyway, I'm just [upset] this one keeps popping up on my searches because I want the surf movie 'Thicker than Water', not this ..."
3,THIS WAS SUPRISINGLY WATCHABLE,"TWO GANG BANGERS [MACK 10 & FAT JOE] ARE IN RIVAL GANGS. BUT, THEY SOON BECOME BEST FRIENDS. DEFINITELY BETTER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER RECENTLY RELEASED GANGSTA MOVIES. FEATURES A LOT OF RAPPERS, SUCH AS; ICE CUBE, MC EIHT, B-REAL, CJ MAC, BAD AZZ, K MAC FROM THE COMRADZ, AND MANY MORE. IT HAS SOME PRETTY GOOD ACTION SCENES. IT WAS AN ALRIGHT MOVIE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE RAPPERS CAN'T ACT. A PRETTY WORTHY ATTEMPT."
5,Thicker Than Water,This is my all time favorite movie. It has so many surprises. The things that happen are just too funny and at times too sad. I can't explain just how much I recommend this movie. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen. There is profanity but it is needed to set the scene. It is captivating.Watch it an you will agree.
1,What a disappointment,"Wow, I'd heard his name mentioned in the local paper so I thought that this Huck guy was some undiscovered talent or something, but I guess sometimes a person isn't famous for a reason. It's just a pretty mediocre CD. He does a cool cover of Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, but everything else is boring and generic. The production is really bad, it sounds cheesy and cheap."
1,Not exactly high quality stuff,"A dear old friend told me I simply must listen to this CD for a laugh becuse it's some pretty yucky stuff. Well, I must say that it's not really as bad as my friend said, since he compared it to the excrement of a certain furry animal, and I know what that stuff is like because I have two of them! This record can be more or less described with one word and that's forgettable. There is just nothing really good on here. There are a few totally bad songs but for the most part it just makes me a little bored."
2,Not worth the effort.,"There are a lot of worthwhile ideas and images in this book, as in Williams' other novels, but the writing style is so often tortuous and obscure that for most people I think it's simply not worth the effort to read."
3,Re-read?,"A difficult read. Characters not well-developed. Stream of consciousness (the character's consciousness) prose strangely captivating. Development of Wentworth's damnation terrifyingly realistic. Would re-read if I were younger. At my age, not certain if I want to invest the time."
3,"Illuminating writing obscured by esoteric, vague language","A certain reviewer mentioned that this book wasn't very accessible (""hard to understand""). I can certainly relate. As a reader of philosophy, theology and classic literature I considered this to be a tantalizing author and book to be introduced to. Unfortunately I wasn't able to fully grasp his imagery, and felt the characters were often too unremarkable (or similar) to distinguish.At times this book drives deep a poignant message. The tragic elements of humanity, artificiality and the mystery of ""bearing one-another's burdens"" all occur to me. Unfortunately they tend to dissipate like vapors as one pursues them through the pages of Descent.I obviously enjoyed this book enough to give it three stars, but, in general, I was underwhelmed."
2,Simply made no sense,"This is, unfortunately, one of the worst books I've ever read. I got surprisingly little out of a book that makes the reader work so hard to extract any kind of meaning from the author's words. Williams does an excellent job of giving the reader a sense of a very dark and morbid setting, and yet it is hard to explain what makes it so. Unless you are a literary scholar, I would advise staying away from this rather dreary and torturous book."
2,Rubberface... An indebth look at a social masterpiece,"Ok so my title may have been misleading... but so is the cover of this video. ""JIM CARREY...IS RUBBERFACE"" in actuallity Jim was just a secondary character. I bought this because I live in Perth Western Australia and this movie was never released here. I got a few cheap laughs but was dissapointed by two things...1) Jim Carrey was hardly in this and despite the title of the film ""Rubberface"" he actually doesn't pull any of his famous wacky faces in this film.2) The main Character and Jim tease getting together romantically through every scene they are in and nothing actually happened.not the worst film ever and a definite watch for die hard fans of Jims work wanting to see where he started out."
5,an okay movie,"i'm not going to lie this has to e one of jim carreys worst movies. i gave this movie a 5 because jim came such a long ways in his comedy since this was made. he did not let one losey flop do him under. i also gave it a 5 because i'm a big jim carrey fan. i love all his movies, even this one. this movie is a must have only if you're a huge jim carrey fan other than that i woul not waste .01 cents on it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you don't unless you're a huge jim carrey fan."
1,Painful,"I made my boyfriend watch this stupid movie with me and about 10 minutes into it, he said this is an After School Special. I about died. That was more funny than this movie ever gets. I like the girl star in it - she is actually a good actress, I wonder what ever happened to her. Anyhow, don't waste your time!"
3,I love Jim Carrey but this movie is a VERY low budget film.,"As much as I admire Jim Carrey's acting abilities now, this movie does absolutly nothing for him."
1,Holy Crap!,"I wish they had a space for negative stars, this movie sucks so bad it is painful. Not just a little bit painful either.It's like seeing a hero's funeral.I would rather get a punch in the eye than to ever have to watch this movie again.Darn you Jim Carey...Darn you for ever subjecting the world to such horror.After watching this movie, I think it is a miracle from God that anyone ever gave you a second chance to redeem yourself.You should thank God every day that you got a second chance.Oh yeah and the next time you get twenty million bucks for making a movie, please try to buy every copy of this movie in existance....please. Thank You"
4,A beautiful book...,"I picked this book up on a whim from a sales table at a book store, and enjoyed it more for the style of the writing, the author's obvious scholarship, and the heart of the characters, than the actual plot, which was fairly standard fantasy fare (although I did particularly enjoy the descriptions and depictions of the characters' religious beliefs). Still, the author was able to make me care about the characters, although they were not especially complex, and their quest."
4,Nice White Sandals,Very comfortable. I believe they will hold up nicely. Well made. They run narrow and about a 1/2 size short. I usually wear and 8.5 M and I ended up with a 9W.
4,Walking Cradles Valerie T-Strap,"These are very comfortable! The cushioning on the bottom of the shoe helped keep them feeling great, even on the first wearing. They run short. Had to buy them in 1/2 size larger than usual."
3,taupe viper color is sharp!,"I always wear an 8 1/2 narrow shoe but this model was sooooo narrow across the forefoot that I could barely velcro it. I love the look and color but had to exchange it for a medium width, (A first for me!) The length is true to size."
1,WILL PILL!,"Washed & dried according to directions, but after 4-5 washings, pilling became a problem and color dulled. Have had to purchase a pill shaver device but the sheets will never feel great anymore. Will wait for my favorite Dept. store to put their high-end flannel sheets on 50% off. They have great sales just about every week (so that should tell you which chain). Their sheets start soft and stay soft. This item feels like muslin now."
1,Grim little story,"This is a story about a man who buys an elderly, arthritic, and half-blind lion. He figures out a way to 'capsulize' the lion's roars into water soluble capsules. This is a neat concept, but is sadly unrealized. Instead the story goes off-putting to grim, and the sad fate of the lion will traumatize children who love animals.My vintage copy has ""Weekly Reader Children's Book Club"" written on the back. I can't imagine why this book would have been chosen for a book club."
4,another young gun with ammo,"this cd is a combination of rock/blues tunes, wes jeans is a excellent guitarist with a feel of the texas blues(where he is from) best cuts are the slow blues ""drowning on dry land"" by roy buchanan smokes. to sat another svr is fair but he is a better players then sheppard and lang."
3,"""Less"" Jeans on Vocals","While I agree with most, Wes Jeans is a talented guitar player and this album has a nice sound from a musical viewpoint, but the problem is that the vocals are very weak and ultimately detract from the overall quality of this effort. One solution might be to find a front man who can handle the vocals, or perhaps focus more on instrumentals. I would hate to see this young talent fade away, although I don't think that will happen because he still plays a hot guitar."
3,Fine Guitar,"Wes plays the guitar with joy. It's likely he will become even better. Vocally, he seems not to have found what matters to him. Great songs in a mix, but not great to listen to the album."
2,If only he didn't sing...,"Hands On introduces us to a great new guitarist. The album shows what a talented young guitar player Wes Jeans is, but the vocals are the ruination of this potentially good cd. The problem lies not only in the thin songs, but the fact that he's not a very strong singer. He doesn't have the voice to go with the music. He'd be much, much better off recruiting a singer and sticking to his guitar! Still, some of the songs are enjoyable if his voice doesn't drive you nuts! Just hold your breath and wait for the solos..."
4,Sure to be one of the great guitarists of our time!,"Wes Jeans has not yet been discovered by most of the general public, but that will surely change! Passionate, expert guitar playing coupled with his throaty vocals are reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix, yet he maintains his own distinct style. Music just seems to flow through Wes, much like the late Stevie Ray Vaughan. Fans of the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band will most likely enjoy his music, but beware - Wes will be fierce competition for Kenny in the months and years to come!!This CD itself does not capture the true nature of Wes's abilities, but it does well to introduce you to him. Some of the songs on the cd are somewhat thin, but all of his originals are outstanding. If you enjoy blues/blues-rock at all, you MUST see Wes play live. It's truly an experience you'll not soon forget!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this for a nephew who struggles with math. He was able to use it twice, then it would never open again on his computer. I installed it on my computer, it opened once and I could never get it to open again. I would have returned it, but I did not keep the receipt because I have NEVER had a problem with anything I have purchased on Amazon. Don't waste your money on this product. I should have read the reviews before I made the purchase."
1,Math blaster blows,"This game is awful. The instructions are non-existent, there is no way to solve questions quickly and directly, there is no way to register your answers immediately. My 8 year old, who has mastered Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 among other games, found this game frustrating and annoying. If you are looking for a game to help your kids improve their math skills, this is not it. Buy the flash cards and save your money for college."
1,Frustrating,"Ordered this twice. Never received it through USPS. Supose that had I opted for expressed shipping I would have received it.Gave up!However, I have used this on my previous p.c and realized that its a wonderful programme for kids. Might try to order again later."
1,You won't master the basics,"I bought this for my two sons, ages 6 and 8, to help them develop speed with their memory math skills. What a disappointment. Even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game. Each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off. Good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed. I wish I'd purchased a different product."
3,Just above average!,"All in all not a bad game. My daughter is 6 years old and she loves the Math Blaster at school...which is an older version. I have XP and this was the newest version so I bought it. There is no support for a gamepad or joystick...only keyboard supported which has my daughter not playing it much, so if your child does not like the keyboard do NOT buy this game!!"
1,worst software ever,"I used this to teach children back in the 90s, but they have changed this wonderful learning game to something so awful and terrible that I couldn't believe the distance they went into 'bad.'It was so difficult that we couldn't even finish one problem. I threw it away.What game these days uses keyboard keys and no mouse? What game makes you use those keyboard keys to hop around 20 times to answer a simply math problem. Stupid. The early game had you flying a spaceship and you had to shoot the right answer as fast as you could. Made much more sense. Hopping around in 6 rows and 5 columns to answer 5 + 18 is just not right.Horrible."
5,great book,i want to buy the book - i am in ireland. can you get it to me - the dealer does not deliver outside USA.
1,False Advertising - Beware!,I ordered this item and just received it. I was NOT shipped what is shown in the image for this product. What they sent me has no red and green color bars. I was sent an entirely different product - one that I would NOT have purchased. Beware of this seller. They are misrepresenting their merchandise.
2,"Good product, just smaller than described","I ordered this specific eye chart because I wanted to replace my old one that was 22"" long. This one was described as 22"" long, but was only 11"" long. The chart does the job, but does not fill the space where the old one was and that was what I wanted it to do.Snellen Eye Chart - Model 10 Foot"
3,"Rather good, but not REALLY good","Jiang Hu is one of those films that's rather good rather than really good, a glossy crime drama that sees gang boss Andy Lau considering retirement as his first child is born while trying to dissuade his left-hand man (literally) Jacky Cheung from killing not just the three most likely suspects behind a prospective hit but their entire families as well. While the two spend most of the film talking over dinner, it's left to Shawn Yue and Edison Chen to carry the plot forward as the would-be hitman and his sidekick whose progress mirrors the two ageing Triads. It's glossy and often strikingly well made, but not enough to hide the thinness of the material, overstretched even at 85 minutes, or the fact that Lau and Cheung's plotline is so static. There is one nice in-joke, however, with PTU's Lam Suet as yet another cop who loses his gun."
1,Not what I thought yet Horrifying,"Well I was expecting a really good crime drama on par with on par with movies like infernal affairs 1 and 2. However what I we got was an overly long and drawn out story line. However this isnt what define the movie for me.There is a very troubling scene in this movie where entire families are executed quite brutally. A man is forced to watch as his son is stretched to death between 2 cars. You here the child scream for his father as the cars screech in opposite directions. Although I know that perhaps executions like this may have occurred in the real world mobs, drug cartels and their like, I don't think anyone needs to see this level of violence and brutality. This one scene made me turn away in disgust and has stayed with me. Maybe I simply dont have the stomach for this kind of thing.I give this movie 1 star not for its flat mediocroty but for the horrifying images. Dante Lam, What is wrong with you?"
2,not as helpful as i had hoped.,"it is a well written book, but unless you understand British references and work in kilos it doesn't help. Most of the advice is best used in europe and doesn't help me in the us with different rules and such."
4,UNDERRATED AND UNDER APPRECIATED,"the burdens of being upright is one amazing trip of a record. i think its only flaw is that at times it is a little too derivative. ""tell it to the sky"" comes off like black hole sun era soundgarden and ""navy bean"" is one great rocking riff but, to me, is very nirvana circa incesticide. there is also the radio candy hit ""mother mother"" which is one great song. smart, toungue in cheek humor with great music to back it up.i see alot of reviewers did not like her voice but i find tracy a good singer, capable if singing and really belting out a good scream when the song calls for it. there were a couple of weaker songs but all in all this is a good cd."
1,the worst cd i ever bought,"I don't know why i ever bought this cd. I was 17 or 18 at the time and apparently hadn't formed any type of taste yet. The songs on this album actually get more and more annoying each time they are played. Bonham doesn't sing, she whines, and screams, and frankly I don't consider that art. If you are considering whether or not to buy this album, just look at the amount of used copies people are trying to sell here on Amazon.com and your decision will be made."
2,Mother Mother rips of Stairway riff;,"It's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album. Mother Mother definitly rips of Stairway To Heaven from Stairway's ending vocals riff. (and as we wind on down the road..) Does she give Zep credit on that? Now that Rockstar Supernova has used the song twice it has brought Mother, Mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me. Good female yell and complain song but I just can't get past that riff rip."
4,A CD that takes a little growing...,"Remember the rebellious years? This CD will take you there again, and perhaps further, with more fury. ""Mother, Mother"" is the perfect start to this CD. Now, I'm not a big fan of noisy guitars and loud drums and muffled voices, but this all fits the modd of the song, so I can accept it like it is. The rest of the CD I had to listen to a little at a time. Some of the songs seem to almost be nonsense or perhaps a little farcical, but it all fits now. Overall, I would say this woman has got a wonderful future in front of her."
5,i really enjoyed this recording,"Tracy Bonham is a very talented singer/songwriter, and i really thought that her music had mature insights that made this recording worthwhile."
2,Spend your money on something better,"The reason I bought this CD is I heard ""Shark's Can't Sleep"" on the radio and really liked it-sort of a feel-good sounding song. I hoped the rest would be similar, but it really was not at all. I found most of the music almost grating, especially the popular ""Mother Mother"" and the lyrics quite uninspired. In addition, the CD as a whole lacked flow, rather, it seemed like a bunch of random songs and chants thrown together. I ended up trying to give this CD away, then throwing it away when nobody wanted it. I did keep a tape of ""Shark's Can't Sleep"", however, which I listen to frequently enough to warrant a couple stars. But I would definitely avoid purchasing this album-go for a single if it is available, or just make a tape from a friend."
1,Kind of a disappointment,"Except for the song, Mother Mother, I didn't really care for the rest of the cd. I bought it for Mother, Mother so I guess I got what I wanted. I had hoped to like other songs as well, but, oh well!"
1,Dreadful flavor,"Had high hopes for this coffee, as a reviewer stated that it had a natural coconut favor. It is dreadful. The product smells like coconut, but has an awful chemical taste. It has a hideous flavor coupled with sickening vanilla background taste. To top things off, it leaves a bitter after taste in your mouth. This product is not drinkable."
2,Not much taste,I was very disappointed that this coffee did not have much coconut taste at all and now I'm stuck with 4 bags! I tastes ok as plain coffee but that's not what I wanted.I think if you gave a cup to someone and didn't tell them it was flavored they would think it was plain coffee.
1,Should be 0 stars!,"If you have any sense at all, you will not buy this item. They actually make the screen even worse. Even the stylus scratches them from just moving across the screen. This product is a load of you know what, and was a total waste of money. Listen to me and be happy: DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Something from Hori or Pelican would be a much better choice. Your welcome!"
1,doesn't fit,The screen protector in this pack does not fit the bottom screen. It is too small. It does not cover the touch screen properly.
1,don't buy it!,"this screen protector is pretty bad, I couldn't make them attach on the screens tightly because there is no glue on them. What's more, they are to tough to protect the screens. Listen to me, don't buy them, or you will just waste your money!"
2,Screen Protector Review,"The order was received in the time and condition stated. However, the sticky tape could not be removed from the protectors which marred them and made them useless."
5,screenguard is great.,It is everything that i expected it to be. I would recomend it to everyone. I received it in very good time also.
4,Worked perfectly,These work great. All the guys were thrilled with how well do they exactly what we needed. In fact we are planning on ordering more.
2,Slow and Boring,"I usually never dog dio and i'm really not dogging the man himself,his voice is still loaded with energy,and range.The reason this album is so bad is that the music is so mundane it puts you to sleep.Dio does his best as usual in a strong vocal delivery but the music just seems to be in the background while he wales.Like the band is just going through the motions.No energy,No real aggression,No originality.I wish he would get his former bandmates,Tracy Z,and Vinnie Appice back,talk about but kickin,yep.Listen to Strange Highways,and Angry Machines,these albums are angry music AND angry Ronnie James DIO."
4,master of the metal,Dios last studio album under his made up stage name one his better ablums from the later years of his act . as dio fan i recommend this to any dio fan and to any like power metal or fantasy style music metal so long live rock and roll :)
5,Another solid Dio release,"I really like this cd. It's not perfect, like the guy below I would give it a 4.5, but I am rounding up.My favorite tracks are the title track, ""One More for the Road,"" ""Shivers,"" ""The Eyes,"" and ""Living the Lie."" There are really no 'weak' tracks on this album (to me at least). However, if you're expecting every track to sound like ""We Rock"" or ""Killing the Dragon,"" I must say you'll be disappointed; most of the songs are a little slower, but just as heavy.If you like Dio, and even if you don't, buy this album. You won't be disappointed."
3,Dio is great ... but this is among his weaker albums,"I think DIO is among the greatest rock/metal vocalists of all time.I really like most of his albums -- but something is missing with MASTER OF THE MOON.It is hard for me to put my finger on it, but it just feels like there is no energy on this album.It plods along with very sparse instrumentation. Most songs are a simple mid-tempo chugging 8th notes and a basic drum pattern ... and when the CD is finished, none of the songs are really memorable in your mind.It is not bad ... it simply is kind of ""there"" if that makes any sense.DIO is great and most of his material are great, but this CD and MAGICA are probably his weakest 2 releases."
2,For Dio fans only,Master of the Moon will satisfy Dio fans and Dio fans only.The material sounds tired here and the music fractured.I liked Killing the Dragon better. This CD isn't awful but it's not Dio's best work.
2,DIO MEANS GOD BUT DIO IS NOT GOD ANYMORE.,"ronnie used to be my idol but after the great DREAM EVIL album there was a slow but steady decline in the quality of his music.Then came MAGICA and my hopes started to rise then KILLING THE DRAGON and i thought that it was up there with some of his best work to date.But to date his worst work would have to be MASTER OF THE MOON. The songs are basically to slow for his great voice. The melody he used to have has just disappeared and even playing it half a dozen times it has failed to grow on me.What i'm saying is, if your looking for early DIO quality then give this a miss."
4,Good Old Fashioned Metal,"Dio's last album as a solo artist (Master of the Moon) has the signature Dio lyrics of fantasy and darkness, and sort of picks up where his previous release, Killing the Dragon left off, musically. However, this album doesn't sound as 'dated' as the previous one, and I give the band a lot of credit for not trying to do too much to please old school metal fans. This album is a balanced effort, with no song that totally jumps out and takes the top slot, thus diminishing the rest of the songs. One can listen to ANY song and feel that it's worthy of the top slot. If I HAD to pick a favorite song, it would probably be THE EYES, followed by MASTER OF THE MOON, then DEATH BY LOVE. Another great thing about this album is its production. Ronnie produced this album himself, and it sounds awesome with clarity of sound and depth. He did a stellar job in the studio, and for that, this album is one of the better sounding Dio albums. 8/10"
3,Kinda weak and bland,"I guess I'm still waiting for Holy Diver the rebirth or something. Or maybe I'm waiting for Even angrier machines. I gave Magica a listen and was kinda glad the album had that classic gloomy Dio, but KTD just wasn't my kind of album, and now MOTM just has that same beat down feel to it of 3 albums ago. Don't get me wrong, Dio's still got the pipes and I proclaim him ""the"" Metal God, but something's wrong with the songwriting in the Dio camp. Where's that anger? Where's that emotion?"
3,Somewhat Disappointing.,"I am a DIO fan, but was somewhat disappointed by this album as I was with the KILLING THE DRAGON release. Ronnie's vocals are still strong and have a fine range, and he is backed by fine musicians, but the material on both albums (MASTER OF THE MOON and KILLING THE DRAGON) is, with two or three exceptions from each album, lacking. It is almost ""filler"". I thought three tracks from MASTER OF THE MOON were excellent: ""One More for the Road"", ""Living the Lie"", and ""Death by Love"". If the better tracks from KILLING THE DRAGON were combined with the better tracks from this new release, I think it would have made a fine collection, especially if a couple more upscale songs were added. This album just doesn't reach the artistic quality of MAGICA, on which I feel Dio put some of his best material in years. Keep at it Ronnie!"
2,Disappointed,"This was my first exposure to Dio, and though I respect what he's done, there was absolutely nothing that caught my interest in this album. Admittedly I'm more of a fan of fast-paced and solo-heavy work of the likes of Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, but this album is short on originality. Some songs, including the title track, where painful to listen to, and lead me to believe that Dio was more a corporate creation than an actual musical talent. Some would contend Dio of today doesn't even compare to his masterpieces in the past, but I would suggest that those new to Dio don't start here. I would advise those who claim this is ""better than most of the crap out there"" to open your eyes to some of the great metal that's come out in the past decade - to more musically complete bands like Opeth, Dimmu Borgir, and Trivium, or to creative forces like Symphony X, Between the Buried and Me, or Agalloch."
4,Worth the wait,"Well I am one of the ones who waited with anticipation for this album. The only track that I really don't care for here is ""I Am"". The rest is typical Dio, a tried and true formula that wins every time. Man, this guy has gigged around for decades and put out a hundred albums. I guess he'll keep going until he dies on stage. Killing the Dragon is a bit more to my liking but still Master of the Moon is GREAT, I love it. That album cover art is really good. You DO have to listen to this album a few times before it grows on you, but it will."
2,WHAT NO STADIA??,"Someone got their wires crossed over in China!When I received it, there was no stadia, sent it back, received another, no stadia!I also noticed the ""sliding"" thing did NOTHING!!Sent it back for a refund.Hey China! We might be your ""dumping grounds"" but wer'e not all stupid!"
4,From a man's perspective...,I was drawn to the book because I wanted to find out what made women athletes tick. Nike does a fine job of this and adds more insight than I expected. The editor does a good job of not letting the book go overboard.
2,"Like it, but similar reliability problems","This DVD player was part of our custom home theater, built in Jan 2004. The unit worked well for about 9 months then stopped spinning up. I've replaced it with another DVD player, but would like to use this one, since it has a custom faceplate and compliments my AV rack. Given the other problems mentioned in these reviews I'm likely to not get it fixed."
3,2 year lifespan,"Well, It has a perfect picture and for 2 years was flawless. I hate the remote, but was able to deal with that. 2 weeks ago, its started to quit and freeze in middle of a playing. That has gotten worse. ocassionally it wont spin up, and now when it does, I either get ""no disc"" warning. Now it will play for 14 seconds and freeze, if it plays at all. So, I sent it out to repair (Circuit City) Tech called me today and said they cant get the repair manual. I called HK, after 20 minutes on hold, The tech said the manuals were available online. I called Circuit City back, informed them of this. The lady told me the head tech would look into this, but if manual cost anything, I would be liable. So, we will see. In the interim, I ordered the DVD47 with a 3 year extended warranty (NOT FROM CIRCUIT CITY). I have had HK for 20 years now. My fl8400 has never missed a beat and none of my recievers ever had isuues, so i was really surprised with the failure of my DVD 22"
1,Problems with DVD 22,"I have owned this DVD player for less then two years. Recently when I power it up the power light goes on, but I am unable to get it to do any of its functions. It will not power off and I must unplug it and repeat this four or five times before it will function.Stay away from this one."
1,"Great player, but does not work anymore","The player used to be really great, especially as CD player with analogue connection to Harman Kardon amplituner. Unfortunately, I have the very same problem with it as the other reviewers. It simply stopped working after about two years. I can power it on or off, but that's it. I cannot play any DVD or CD - buttons just don't work. It seems that the player software has crashed."
1,More bugs than a picnic in August,"Have had my DVD 22 for 2 years now and I'm extremely disappointed with it. For the first 6-7 months it operated O.K., with good picture and sound through my AVR-645. However, it soon began to show all kinds of (presumably) software-related issues such as skipping, freezing up on brand new disks, etc. Shortly thereafter, the fiber optic input died, so I'm back to copper connections.Now, in order to turn the machine on I have to manually hold down the power button for 3-4 seconds, which turns on the power light but nothing else. Then, I turn it off, wait 5 seconds, and repeat this procedure 2 more times. USUALLY, on the 4th try the machine acutally boots up, all the lights turn on, and its functional again. But it still freezes up during playback. This would never happen with a ""low end"" Sony!H/K quality really seems to be dropping rapidly, and I'm not sure that its worth paying extra for the ""bling"" value of their name when their product quality is so poor."
2,Very little information,"This is a great style of Martial Art with many, many techniques and options but this DVD is really a SHORT introduction with really only two key techniques shared here and one exercise of value.There is simply not enough here to recommend this purchase. I'll keep because it's more of a hassle to return and easier to share or give away to a friend."
5,Excellent book - fully worth the price!,This book contains all you need to know whether you are a soil gardener looking to get into soilless growing or a total beginner. The author is very frank and gets right to the important details in a friendly voice and easy to understand style.I've built all 3 systems and they are outperforming my soil garden by a factor of two to three times.Very pleased - i recommend this book!
3,Personal Web Server Woes,"OK, so the book doesn't really deserve a 3. I just wanted to vent. Is it just me, or did anyone else find the (non)treatment of how Personal Web Server works maddening. The authors state that they assume throughout the book that the reader will have PWS running. Fair enough...but how about a little more detail on how to make that happen! At least a mention somewhere, anywhere, that the Front Page Server Extensions need to be installed on PWS (that setup doesn't handle that little detail) would have been helpful! I spent 2 hours on the Microsoft web trying to figure that one out. And maybe just a few words on how PWS behaves, what web folders really are, all that basic stuff. Anyway, I hope the remaining 800 pages are a litlle more ""newbie"" friendly."
4,Best Available,"I couldn't give this book a 5 because I found some things missing, and describing almost everything from a personal web server standpoint isn't helpful to people with disk based Webs. I do, however, consider it to be the best one that I've read, and I've been through quite a few.The information that they provided on Meta tags and site submission I could not find in any other FrontPage book, only in books dealing entirely with HTML. I think this info alone makes it worth buying, especially for a novice. For the more advanced people, the Java and related info was very good.This book, along with Running FrontPage 2000, and the Getting Started manual that comes with FrontPage should be about all you need."
3,I was very dissappointed to find out it is made in CHINA when its AllClad that is supposed to be all made in USA!!!!!,"I bought this item as I was under the understanding that All Clad was a product that was all made in the USA, there are a few covers that Ive found on the internet that are made in China, but was very shocked when I got this double boiler (being all metal like the pans are) to find out this was made in CHINA!!!!!!!! NOT EVEN MADE IN THE USA!!!!!!! I will ask next time, I do not trust China products and refuse to send my money over seas when this economy is so bad!!!! ASK AMERICANS WHERE YOUR PRODUCT COMES FROM!! DONT BUY CHINA PRODUCTS< YOUR HURTING YOUR OWN COMMUNITY>"
1,Does not fit my 2 quart All-Clad saucepan,"I purchased this specifically to use with an All-Clad 2 quart saucepan, with a 6"" diameter, which is in like-new condition and purchased fairly recently. It doesn't fit. The saucepan's handle angles upward and comes into contact with the bottom of the steamer insert so that the insert doesn't completely make contact with the pan rim. As a result, half of the steam escapes. Items cook but it takes 2x as long as it should. I'm returning mine as a result. The insert does appear to be what All-Clad lists on their website as ""designed to fit 2, 3 and 4 quart All-Clad sauce pans"", but it simply doesn't fit mine."
2,too small,this steamer is too small to do anything with and isn't muchhm good for me as I need one at least 10 inches in diameter.
2,All-clad steamer,"My bad. I have a set of All-clad cookware, and wanted a steamer. I should have heeded the many reviews that said that this product is not a good solution. The fact that it necks down at the bottom really DOES mean that food cooks unevenly and that things stick to the part where it necks down. The sticking part is particularly true for leafy vegetables. I'll be getting rid of this and reverting to a good, old fashioned, collapsable steamer basket."
2,All-Clad Stainless Steamer with Lid,"I was disappointed with this product because of the quantity of food that it accomodates. Steam holes do not cover the entire bottom of this steamer and food may scorch when not placed directly over the steam holes. Food can only be placed toward the bottom center of the steamer over the steam holes to prevent scorching. I have another stainless steamer that I prefer because steam holes cover the entire bottom of the steamer. However, this steamer is o.k. for steaming a smaller amount of food where all of the food fits over the steam holes in the center bottom of the steamer."
1,Made in China!,This steamer is not of the same quality as the USA manufactured All-Clad cookware. It is lighter in weight and the handles and lid are not as nicely constructed. You are mistaken if you think you are getting the real deal with this item! I am sending it back. The consumer ought to know what he/she is getting!
3,Quality and Fit but Strange Shape,"Agree with the review from C Coleman - in order to fit multiple size pots, the bottom of the pan is not flat but has two 'layers'. Generally fine for vegetables but not so good for dumplings or other items where everything needs to cook evenly flat on the bottom. Will look for a fit for purpose steamer. Otherwise, expected quality and finish."
5,"Yes Rasta, Speak The Truth","This is my favorite album by Buju. It's a modern reggae classic, his first conscious Rasta effort after his role as a Dancehall superstar. Buju's style is unique, nobody else sounds like de bredren... you can feel the passion and strength that he brings forth here. On the track Muderer, Buju is calling out the crimes of those who destroy another life, this came after a couple of Dancehall artists in the community were killed. Untold Stories and Not An Easy Road are songs definetly reflecting his new Rasta vision. The late and great Garnett Silk joins Buju on the track Complaint for a rub-a-dub style conscious explosion. Just because Buju is a Rastaman, he still brings some fun in his tracks with Champion and Chuck It So as well songs like Wanna Be Loved. No matter what he brings on this album... all if the tunes hold their own. All the songs are great, this is without a doubt Buju's best album. RASTAFARI!"
4,Best Buju Banton Album Ever,"This is a must for any reggae collection. This is Buju's best album ever. The lyrics are deep, honest and the beats are fresh. ""Not an easy road"" could be each an every one of us life's anthem: a classic. ""Untold Stories"" and ""Till i'm laid to rest"" are beautifully composed socio-political pieces. ""Wanna be loved"" speaks to the hearts of everyone one of us - I wanna be loved not for who you think I am nor what you want me to be, could you love me for me -. You have to sing along every time! You have to jump up and dance everytime you hear ""Champion."" Buju has never (up to July 2002) done a better album - before or after. This is a timeless album. My mother loves it too. A must for any serious reggae collector."
5,Best Dance Hall album ever,"If you like Dance Hall Reggae you need this album! I can't even describe how tight this album is. It is more dance hall influenced than Buju's later albums (it seems like he chilled out later and got more of a roots influence later). However, I think he should have stuck with the 'til Shiloh style. The album also includes accoustic songs that are like psalms which give the album a unique touch that most dance hall ablbums lack. If you don't have this album, BUY IT! You need this! It is an must have for anyone who even remotly likes reggae music."
5,Til Shiloh is an inspiration,Buju did it. This album is one of my most favorites. With this one Buju brings everything together. You realize why he is a star and has fans everywhere. Keep shining.
5,Classic Reggae,If u enjoy reggae..dancehall and roots it is all here in this Cd. Great mix of spiritual songs and dancehall like on ly Buju can do. This is a classic that everyone who likes raggae should have. This is my 2nd copy i played the first one to death.
5,Nuff respect to a genuinely creative artist,"I went home to Jamaica in 1996 and was chillin' with some friends at the university when I could hear somebody on campus blasting ""It's not an easy road"", the first time I ever heard the song.As soon as I got back to the States, I bought it. I continue to love this cd three years later. Unlike some djs, Buju has always had something to say, and in this album, he says it eloquently and honestly. In every line, from ""Til I'm Laid to Rest"" to ""Untold Stories"", he tells the story of the uncelebrated Jamaicans who simply try to make a living everyday amidst incredible obstacles. He awakens the conscience in ""Murderer"" but still knows how to plea to be a woman's ""Only Man"". His range on this album is simply astonishing, and while everyone sings the praises of Lauryn Hill's originality, just take a look at this brave, honest testimonial of an album and you'll see that taking risks pays when you have a real story to tell."
3,Love true war stories,"I love true war stories. This one doesn't flow real smooth though. Very ""Diary"" like and not a real mix of characters and activities. Much more direct or clinical but I did enjoy the stories."
5,A BEGINNERS GUIDE TO A GREAT ADVENTURE,"I HAVE BEING ATTENDING RSE FOR OVER AROUND 10 YEARS;AND I STILL FIND THIS BOOK AN EXELLENT INTRODUCTION TO RAMTHAS TEACHINGS.IT IS A BASIC REVIEW OF RAMTHAS PHYLOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY,THAT INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DISCIPLINE OF C&E;(CONSCIOUSNESS AND ENERGY)THAT IS ACTUALLY TAUGTH AT THE """"CREATING PERSONAL REALITY WEEKENDS"""" AND AT """"BEGINNERS REATREATS""""AT YELM,WA CAMPUS AND AROUND THE WORLD IN THE RAMTHA SCHOOL OF ENLIGHTEMENT WORLD TOUR EVENTS:[...].IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE TEACHINGS OF THIS GREAT MASTER AND ARE CONSIDERING SOMETIME ATTENDING ANY OF THE BEGINNERS REATREAT DESCRIBED ABOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT RSE;THIS BOOK IS A BEST CHOICE TO START THE JOURNEY OF YOUR ENLIGHTEMENT."
3,Tough one to get into,"I've had trouble getting into this book. I pick it up every month or so and try again, but just can't get my head into it. I've found, in the past, when I'm ready for the book, it will become an easy read. Guess I'm just not ready - yet !"
3,Flower power,Behind the quirky alterna-pop of this short lived entity lies some memorably catchy guitar rock- enough to make the album worth revisiting if not flat out recommending.
3,"Good, not great","This is a good recording and has some good songs (and some forgettable songs, ex. ""Got a Girl""). ""Rocketpop"", ""Noose"", and ""Prick"" are some of the standouts. ""Prick"" being my personal favorite. Definitely worth the used price of $0.01, but make sure and buy ""Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb"" if you don't already have it which is TD's true masterpiece."
5,weak?? not at all!,"ok let's admit it: if it wasn't for ""i got a girl"" many of us would've never known this band! and this is just one of the reasons why this cd is awesome...after years and years listening to it, you'll even end up skipping that song, believe me! definitely one of the best cds of the 90'smy personal favorites are ""piranha"", ""trip along"", ""step behind"" and ""prick"", but of course this doesn't mean the rest of the songs are not good enough!"
5,Absolutely!,"Your initial listen to these folks will make you think your ear is cringing. However, after you spin it a few more times you will realize the charm and beauty that is found within this disc. Now I am a fan of Our Lady Peace, and I put them in a class with Tripping Daisy - but I have very different feelings toward both, despite similar genre. This album is worth every penny, and a classic, really - a fine example of the late 90's scene."
5,one of the most intrigueing cds i own,"everyone of these songs has a different meaning to me, the music is differnt, the lead vocal is great, the lyrics are amazing, if you really appriciate music for the words and the creativeness then you'll love this album, once i listened to the whole thing, ""i got a girl"" was low on the richter scale."
2,Not Their Best Material,"I bought this record primarily because of the track ""I Got A Girl,"" and figured that the whole album would be full of ""I Got A Girl""s. The album is not what I expected it to be. While there are some good tracks--the aforementioned hit, plus the bracing opener, ""Rocketpop,"" ""Piranha,"" and the pained ""Prick,"" it was a weaker album than what I had expected. I've seen Tripping Daisy perform, and while they are a fine live act, their best record would probably have to be ""Bill,"" which came out on Dragon Street in 1991 or so. This album does, however feature some good guitar work by Wes Breggeren, but one thing that is too much of is Tim DeLaughner emphasizing the Perry Farrell aspect of his vocal style too much."
3,Just OK,"Fairly typical hard alternative music similar to Jane's Addiction. The album is not exactly exciting, but it is basically OK and contains the fine `I Got A Girl', which fans may have heard on alternative radio. `Bang' is also a standout."
1,This CD really stunk,"I should have given it more of a shot other than ""I got a Girl"" and I did, and despite TRYING to like it, it's just sitting in the back of my collection. I saw that the average rating of the CD was 4 stars, and I wanted to take it down a peg, so here I go... avoid it, there's much better stuff out there"
3,"Interesting, but could be better","I really enjoyed the basic story of this book - about a woman's career as a stewardess working her way from flight training to becoming in charge of her own crew. The story was great - however there was quite a strong use of language that I didn't think was quite appropriate. If you ignore that, you'll have a great read!"
3,Not Bad!,"I must admit, many drug movies fascinate me and there are very few on crystal meth. This, however, was not primarily a drug abuse movie. It was more of a spooky, scary type (like ""The Ring"") with a lot of hallucinations. The main character Hector did frighten me sometimes because of his insane anger. That usually upsets me. His girlfriend partner, Dorena, was too hot and sober to be true, most of the time. The outcome was predictable, but overall, I'm glad I bought and watched it. It's a different look into the seedy world of methamphetamine use when compared to ""The Salton Sea"" and ""Spun"" (both way better movies than this). If this is what crystal meth does, I never want any part of it."
2,Movie wasnt very good......,"The movie was terrible, but thats not the sellers fault. Item arrived quickly. Would buy from seller again..."
4,Cat toy balls,I was searching for cat balls that had catnip in them. I have been and am still searching for a certain catnip ball and have been unable to find. When I saw these balls I decided to buy and see how my cats liked them. I was disappointed to see they did not have catnip in them. At first my cats were not very interested but since then they have enjoyed rolling them around our hardwood floor and carrying them in their mouths even to play on the bed with them. I realized today that one has broken on the inside but the outside material has not been ripped yet. I am rating 4 stars since my cats love them but not 5 stars since no catnip in them. We have had the balls about 1 1/2 months.
5,Great Album!!!,"Shakira has done it again! This album contains many beautiful songs that show off how talented and unique a singer Shakira is. I think this album is a bit more mellow than her previous ones, with the exception of La Tortura and a few others, but it's still amazing nonetheless..."
2,The album lacks the raw passion of the past,"This CD really disappointed me.. I have been a fan of Shakira for a long time, I adore Donde Estan Los Ladrones and Piez Descalzos.. I was not happy with her Laundry Service album, either--referring to the Spanish songs--and I do not like this. Yes, her voice is beautiful, it has always been beautiful, and it always will be. She definately has a more American sound throughout the CD. I feel like she shows depth throughout the album, and she shows a range of voice, but it just does not have the fire of the other ones. None of the songs are very memorable outside of the lyrics themselves.. she sounds very soft and almost bored while she is singing in some songs. I feel like this is a different Shakira, one who has come of age, and mellowed a bit. I miss the guitar, I miss the fire, I miss the raw passion of the past. I am disappointed by her return to Spanish."
4,Fijacion Oral by Shakira,Highly recommend this CD to everyone. Shakira is one of the many talented female artists today!
5,Shakira just gets better and better!,"Having bought all of Shakiras previous CD's, I knew that this one would be great. I had no idea! This is easily her best one and has a variety of styles making this her best one yet. I put it in my CD cassette in my car, but I seem have a hard time listening to the other CD's in there. I love Shakiras voice and she doesn't let you down here. Although a long time coming, it is worth the wait."
1,i dont understand how you ppl can buy something,i dont understand why you ppl can buy something you cant even understand its like she didnt even thank of us of cant speak nothing but englash how selfish is that i thank its much selfifsh on her part i for one is no longer a fan of hers since she has done this to the us and that gose for anyone singer who will do this kind of thing i will longer be a fan of them eather i give this cd a big 0 come we atre the us not overseas we wont something we can understand
3,Eh........,"I have to say that after I heard international No. 1 ""La Tortura"" I just had to go out and purchase Fijacion Oral to see how amazing it is. Shakira's trademark bleat is in fine form here--unfortunately ""La Tortura"" is really the only track that has hit potential. Fijacion Oral is a consistent release but nothing remotely approaches that catchy lead single. Some songs get pretty close, though, like the rock-oriented ""La Pared,"" disco-infused ""Las De La Intuicion,"" the sweet ""Dia De Enero"" and the thundering ""Lo Imprescindible."" Despite its obvious flaws Shakira's signature sound pulls the bland material through well enough that you'll find yourself enjoying Fijacion in its entirety."
3,"Progress, Progress","Again, this was a cd that I also had to listen to a couple of times and to tell the truth, I'm sick of it already.Good music, good lyrics but nothing to write home about."
2,THE WORST SHAKIRA EVER!!,"I've been a shakira fan since her debut album ""Pies Descalzos"", but it seems she's gone out of focus, first of all the album only has 10 original songs wich is actually pathetic, and of the 10 songs only 3 are worth listening, i know she's really in love with Antonio but COME ON!! WE'VE BEEN LISTENING HER LOVE STORIES FROM THE BEGINING!! THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING MORE TO WRITE ABOUT, I'M I RIGHT?"
3,average and plain,"Thank you Shakira for singing 100% in Spanish. However, this album is short of a great one. Although the lyrics are phenomenal and heart-felt, the music is average pop sung by a great voice. And Cerati's and Sanz's collaborations didn't help out either. Teenage girls, you will love this album. Other adult types, save the money or buy something else."
1,I can't believe people actually like this crap!,"This CD truthfully makes me dizzy!! Shakira lost all her talent by singing these dumb, bad songs. After her ""Laundry Service"" album, I thought she would do something even better, but she certainly did something even worse. Songs like ""No"" and ""La Tortura"" really make me sick, and I really haven't ever heard any of those completely. She totally lost ""it"" with her manly voice, added to stupid lyrics and bad and boring music."
2,Boring,"I'm really disappointed. Shakira has so much talent and can write and sing such great songs, but on this album she doesn't show it. Most of the songs are absolutely boring, like old-fashioned 70's pop songs, no exciting ideas, just straight music for sleeping well. Don't know what others can find in this album..."
2,I dont understand why she did this!!!,I've been a fan of Shakira for a long time but this album is really bad. La tortura is a very great song and very deep but the others are to boring and the music is not like her at all. Think twice before buying this album. But if you are a Shakira fan go ahead but you've been warned.
3,nOT what I expected,"First off , if youre expecting something like Laundry Service, you will be dissapointed.I liked laundry service sooo much better!!Cant say its a total waist but if youre expecting something like La Tortura (which is perfect by the way)because most of them dont have the same rythym and beat.What I do like is that the music is varied but not hot.The tracks I liked are the following:1La pared2 La tortura3 uN DIA ESPECIAL4 nO5lA TORTURA rEMIX-FOR REGGEATON FAMS"
3,Great in any language,"Shaki! Shaki! I don't understand a single thing she's saying on this record, and I love it. She's really branched out and at the same time solidified her sound w/this new record. Very good all around: nice, easy ballads; fun party tunes; nice ass-shakers. Good stuff. I can't wait for Part II - the English version!"
5,i Viva Shakira !,"I'm French, and even if the album will be released in France the next week, I am crazy of "" La Tortura "".Someone, I don't remember who, was blaming Shakira about her spanish album. Don't you know that she is Columbian ? Don't you know that she had her first successes in South America and Spain ? Don't you know that she will release a second album called "" Fixation Oral 2"" with other songs but in english ?So please, don't say if you don't know ! Stop thinking that english is the only language in the world ! Spanish is very beautiful. Italian too ( and French too ;) ).Shakira is a world citizen. She speaks fluently english and has put French and Germand in two of her last songs. I can't wait to hear this !"
1,This album is horrible.,It's a real torture to listen only to the snippets. I would not take this disk free.
1,Rubbish,"Shakira's music has now degenerated into Americanised rubbishThe downhill slide starting with Laundry Service has reached a new record Low with this Album.What Happened to the beautiful Spanish songs that had feeling and passion.lyrics that flowed with the music.All now lost in the American translationShakira, Shame on you.... writing music for a Country that is so uneducatedIt can only appreciate music in English.Viva La USD"
1,Sha-sucks-ira,"I figured this CD was a waste. Shes a waste, and there is nothing on this CD, or any of her other previous CD's. By far, Shakira, You suck. Shes a Cop-Off of alanis morset...who wants to listen to this garbage."
4,Esta Bueno,"This CD is great. You will want to listen to it over and over again. Shakira is great when she sings in English, but when she sings in Spanish... Oh, it will make you melt. Defintately not a one hit wonder, Shakira shows she has staying power as both an American and International Rock Star. A must have."
4,Es Una Tortura No Escucharlo!,"After Listening several Times the songs I liked, because the truth the first time that listens to it I don't like I for anything, the artistic evolution is Noticed that has had, although Definitively it is not the best work discografico in her, the song that I like but after La Tortura it isLa Pared its rhythm and letter is they are pleasant, one of the best is NOT, it is necessary to emphasize that it is the first time that shakira interprets a song that is not of its responsibility, Las De La Intuicion has a good rhythm and it is amusing, the rhythm Bossa Nova of Obtener Un Si it is very calm and rises until the sky it relaxes you until the maximum thing, the worst song in the Album is En Tus Pupilas it is too boring it provokes me I vomit, but the rest of the disk is acceptable."
3,great voice... not sure bout the rest,"i am not denying that shakira is an amazing performer (just look at the video for la tortura) or has an amazing voice but this album kinda dissapointed me. i know its been ages since her last album but i feel she shud have waited a little longer.the labum starts srtong, la pared and la tortura being my favourites, and improved in the remixes. but but there are some songs that just do not appeal to me and feel like they were thrown together in 5 minutes because she realised there wernt enough songs here to make an album.the beats in some of these songs really dont match the feel or shakiras voice. 'obtener un si' sounds like a background track off the game ""the sims"" and 'escondite ingles' sounds like a haloween tune.however there are some clasics here that stand very well on their own. if she had waited for some more great songs to come along then this album would have been great, quality over quantity."
3,Good,"This has a more mellow feel to it compared to the recent ""Live"" cd/dvd. The inclusion of male vocalist did not do much for me. The dvd side has a video which is fair and a blurry interview. Overall, I was ecpecting a bit more after the 5 star ""Live"" cd/dvd. Maybe the November release will be better."
3,"Although a good return to Spanish, not the Skakira of old","After listening to the album all the way through about three times, I have come to realize this album, although in Spanish, is built for cross over success. That is not in any way a bad thing, but purists will have issue with this album. ""La Tortura"", the first single with Spanish Crooner Alejandro Sanz is the best track and is worthy of top ten single of the year 2005 status. The rest of the cd is a mix of odd fillers where Shakira is off vocally to solid tracks that are not singles but qulaity tracks that make the album worth the purchase. She is in a sense, the victim of her own standard she set with ""Pies Desclados"" and the unforgetable classic album ""Donde Esta Los Ladrones?"". Last, being Latino, I am personally happy to see her return to Spanish. Trust me English speakers, she sounds much better in her native tongue. Todovia te queiro Shakira!!!!Como Siempre Amor!!!!"
5,awesome cd!,"I must say I love 10 out of 12 of the songs in this cd. Shakira is back and better than ever. I really don't like her in English..she loses her enchantment..her power.. Shakira's lyrica are felt only if you understand spanish....I thought she had lost it in Laundry Service.songs like .Eyes like yours and Objection were just plain horrible....Now she sounds great...her voice, the music can't wait to see this production live!!!. I recommend ""La Pared"" with the ""coldplay"" sound....""La Tortura"", and Obtener un Si.My least favorite songs are : Lo imprencindible and the reggaeton version of La Tortura, what was the point to that???Shakira you rule!"
5,Amazing...,"I thought I was losing her to other artists like Britney, Mariah, Christina and Ashlee, but she's back. She's really back (tears of joy). The song ""NO"" alone is worth more than the cost of this album, but really, all of the songs are amazing. I was there during the release of her Spanish albums ""pies descalzos"" and ""donde estan los ladrones"", and then I kind of disappeared, but I'm back. This CD is truly, truly wonderful. I love her, she's so smart, articulate, beautiful and so very talented."
3,"Great album, but better is to be had","Shakira is a great artist whose voice bespells the listener no matter what she sings. However, it appears that her best so far was ""Donde Estan los Ladrones."" The songs in this album are very reminecent of ""Laundry Service."" They are similar enough to have been rejected ideas for that album.For a new fan, I don't know if I'd introduce them to this album, especially if they are English speakers, better to start them on ""Donde Estan los Ladrones."" For the fan though, collect it. Even if you don't like the album much it'll give him/her more Shakira to savor."
1,Shakira failed in this one................,"I have been one of the biggest fans of shakira, but this CD is not worth it. I pre-ordered 5 copies of the cd to give to other fans, such as my sisters and boyfriend, but I regreted it so bad. Why after a cd like Laundry Service, this is nothing?"
4,Tortura is great,"I like Tortura (both versions and videos - super sexy) - great song, great duo - the other songs are good but Tortura is the best"
4,La Tortura!!,"Overall the CD is OK, now if we talk about La Tortura, now that's music, and the video is great, it's soo erotic, the other sons are kinna good, but just La tortura and the video makes it worth it, the rest of the DVD is boring and Alejandro Sans seems pushy and cheesy!. Arriba las Divas latinas!!"
5,Este album esta super!!,"I bought this album today and I've been listening to it quite very often.. a lot of the songs are just so different from anything she has done before.. Im not sure why some people didnt like it, I honestly dont think its missing anything.. well I guess they could have added more than 10 songs, maybe like 13 or 14 not including remixes or acoustic versions. Overall this cd is great, I loved it and I cant wait for Volume 2 to come out November!"
4,Much better than 'Laundry Service',"No offense, but Shakira kind of sucks in English. I was so happy to see that this entire album is in Spanish. This sounds more like the Shakira I loved before she became a sell-out and dyed her hair blond and sang in English. She just sounds better in Spanish and her lyrics don't sound so awkward. I love that there are two versions of 'La Tortura' and 'La Pared.' 'Dia de enero' is the song that is on permanent repeat in my cd player. This cd took a couple times of listening to it to really appreciate it, but in the end, it's really good...still not as good as 'Donde estan los ladrones?' but that's pretty hard to beat."
4,Great comeback from an excellent artist,"After being a little hesistant about buying this cd (a lot of people lot negative reviews about it), I'm glad I did. It doesn't sound like any of her previous works, but it still mesmerizes. I love almost all of the songs. The ones she did with Gustavo Cerrati are great tunes. I especially love ""Las de la Intuición"", ""Lo imprescindible"", ""No"", ""La Pared"", ""Dia Especial"" and ""En tus pupilas"". If I don't give it a five star, is because she could have included more songs (not two remixes, although they're good) and the song ""Obtener un Si"" doesn't quite do it for me. If you like Shakira, I recommend to buy this cd. If you're waiting for another ""Pies Descalzos"", ""Donde están los ladrones?"" or, specially, ""Laundry Service"", you will be dissapointed."
2,Big disappointment !,"I think this album is very weak compared the previous ones.Shakira was special because her songs were unique and edgy.Most of the new songs sound very generic, like soap opera themes. The lyrics are corny.I would only rescue La Tortura, Un Dia Especial and El Escondite Ingles.Come on Shakira you are smart, sensual and worldly.Stop holding up. We are ready to hear your grown up songs.I hope the English CD has more to offer.I want the rocker Shakira back !"
2,Not that good,"I don't think this is a very good album. Most of the songs are really bad, I'm so dissapointed. I waited so long for her new music to come out and this is not what I was expecting, if you want to buy some of her best music, buy her first two albums, ""Pies Descalzos"" and "" Donde estan los ladrones?"". I hope this can be helpful."
2,A not so good comeback!,"Unfortunately, Shakira's new album lacks the energy and power of her previous success, Laundry Service. Except for ""la tortura"" most songs are quite depressive and without her so characterized latin rythm.Because we are used to Shakira's ability to release success after success, this album is a disapointment."
2,"Ummm... It's dirty, she must take it to the laundry","Is the worst Shakira's cd ever, even worst than Magia, it's a bad copy of all the music we heard in the 80's... She lost her latin style. I love her music but this one is bad.. The lyrics are full of chiches like in No She shings 'Te juro, no miento' But in the latin music 9 of each 10 songs say that phrase... Oh Shakira What a bad album... but wait En tus pupilas is great, the sound-a-like Coldplay Cloks 'La pared' is good too... Lucky for the next time."
1,Too many errors,"I recently completed 2 Microsoft courses on C# and was hoping to use this book for review and to fill in gaps. As I read thru the first 2 chapters I came across a number of errors in the book's text, examples and sample test answers. I pulled down the book's errata from the publisher's web site and it didn't address the errors I'd seen. If I am finding undocumented and obvious errors in the introductory material then I can't rely on the information for the more complex subjects. The book simply doesn't serve its stated purpose."
1,Useful in spite of itself,"This book is poorly written and filled with errors. There are sections in the text that are painfully naive. If you see this book in a store take a look at the explanation of application models on pages 224-227. Ignorance abounds.With that said, I actually found the book somewhat useful as a study aid. It gave me a good framework to start with and a number of examples apps to work through. Ironically, all of the errors eroded my faith in the author, which compelled me to research many of the topics independent of the text, which lead to a deeper understanding of .NET. (Thanks go to the MSDN, not this book)This book is really bad. I recommend you save your money and use it to publish your own .NET study guides. The competition in this market is very weak.Jake"
1,The authors themselves must have failed the exams,"There are definitely loads of typos, but the real danger lie in those downright wrong statements such as can be found in the Test Answers on page 119:- ""The array constructor cannot take an explicit size parameter as well as initialization.""- ""Events must be declared as static""And then, ""Any delegate that is declared as public void is a multicast delegate"", which is okay per se, but then what's the point of this statement? there is no relation whatsoever with being ""public void"" and multicast delegate.With such a poor knowledge of .NET framework, how many bugs these guys must have helped to introduce into the apps they wrote for their customers? I wonder!"
3,This book is good to know the sylabus for the MCAD/MCSD exam,Author has tried to bundle lots of data into a single book. Its a good effort but this book is not enough to pass the exams. This book is good for beginners to get an overview of the .NET technology before going to advanced concepts.
1,"So bad, I would give it minus 5 stars.","Not only does this book a waste of money and time, but it is also misleading. I can hardly drive myself to read to chapter 3. I can find a hole, misleading, or wrong information in every 10 pages on average and end up cursing.The writer doesn't even know how to use @ for the verbatim string, but tried to explain it, and it appears to be completely wrong. They also provides a very bad example for garbage collection and lots of completely useless examples on even the simplest topics.My recommendation is stay away, or if you have bought, you had better just burn it before it cause of you fail the exam that you should have pass."
1,C# All-in-one,"I really liked the book. I studied for the 70-315 and 70-316 using the material provided in the book. I found the book easy to ready with great examples. I have Read Books from Ken Lind and Marj Remple in the past and have always been satisfied with the content and their knowledge on the subject material.I look forword to seeing the next book written by them.Thanks for the help guys, the book really worked for me."
2,This book is not for the exam,If you like to pass th exams that is not what you need. buy M$ book for the exam. i passed 315 - 316 but mainly from msdn not this book.
2,Stick to the MS Press books on this one,"It took exactly two days to read this book from front to back because of its super simplistic approach. I have read the MS Press books for 70-315 and 70-316 and I would strongly advise sticking to those. The book devotes very little time to what is actually going to be on the test. Those of you who are not going to take 70-315 and 70-315 and are looking for a book to learn C# as it relates to web development, windows development and xml web services, might consider this book. It's not a bad starter book. If you have any experience at all, this book will be a bore."
1,The web MasterExam comes with the book can not be found,"The three bonus web MasterExam downloands from learnKey can not be found on the website. The free C# online traning module couldn't be found nither. I have tried the LearnKey technical support and seems that no one know where they are. If Mr. Lind read this review, please check this out youself!The book itself is for beginer. It can be used as a reference book. The MS press book is the right one for the certification!"
2,Basic Introduction - Riddled with Errors,"Errors Errors Everywhere... The book is a descent high level introduction to the material, but thats where it stops. As many have stated before and I will state again, the book is riddled with mistakes and it seems that McGraw Hill gave up on the errata sheet after only 14 pages (about 50 pages short).If your just looking for an intro to this material, and this book is cheap enough, I suppose it'll do. I would be remiss however if I did not say that there is NO WAY this book alone could get you throught the exams. It just doesn't have anywhere near the necessary depth of information needed for the MS Certs."
2,Too many mistakes,"Seems to have decent coverage of the topics and does have plenty of useful information. However, as noted in other reviews, the book contains a substantial number of inaccuracies, many of which could mislead the reader toward incorrect answers on the exams."
5,WORLD OF PEACE?,"I LOVE ALL ANIMALS & ENJOY HAVING THIS PRINT AS A FRAMED PICTURE IN MY HOME. IT REMINDS ME OF THE MANY WONDERFUL VIDEOS & PICTURES OF DIFFERENT SPECIES OF ANIMALS UNEXPECTEDLY FORMING A RELATIONSHIP. ALSO, WHETHER OR NOT THE ORIGIN CREATOR OF THIS PICTURE INTENDED THIS, TO THOSE OF US EDUCATED IN THE BIBLE, IT REPRESENTS THE COMING 1000 YEAR REIGN OF CHRIST WHERE ALL ANIMALS & HUMANS WILL BE AT PEACE WITH EACH OTHER (ISAIAH 11:6-9). THE LARGE GLOBE IN THE BACKGROUND REMINDS ME OF THE FUTURE ""NEW HEAVEN"" & ""NEW EARTH"" MENTIONED IN REVELATION 21:1. YES, THIS IS FANTASY TO SOME, BUT A HOPEFULL FUTURE FOR THOSE OF US DISSATISFIED WITH HUMANITY'S NEGATIVITY, HATE, & VIOLENCE."
1,Only printed on the front,"I anticipated getting a shirt that had every animal in the world. I could see from the picture that obviously there were only a small portion of the world's animlas on the front of the shirt. I assumed all the other animals of the world were printed on the back of the shirt. I was astonished when I got my item and realized there were NO ANIMALS ON THE BACK OF THE SHIRT. Do not be fooled by the image shown, there are only animals on the front of the shirt"
1,Not True--Which Means It Is A Lie!,"World of animals, scmorld of animals. This t-shirt's description is incorrect. Yeah, yeah, it's 100% cotton. But WORLD of animals? No way. The entire WORLD of animals is not depicted on this t-shirt!! What a ripoff!! Buyer beware!!"
1,No Wolves,"I bought this shirt last year...I was hoping to invoke the magic of the 3 Wolves style shirt (EVERYONE IN MY TRAILER PARK IS WEARING THOSE) but to give it a little more flair.Let me tell you, the animal spirits this shirt invokes is way too busy. The Elephant Spirit add great girth to my bowel movements. The Giraffe Spirit makes only leafy green veggies taste good. The Rabbit Spirit made me start humping anything that moved... my poor poodle ;(. The Ram Spirit caused me to start headbutting the cars driving in and out of our trailer park. The Polar Bear Spirit caused me to buy an above ground pool, fill it with ice water and swim in it naked.After I was release on a $2,000 bond I immediately went home and burned this shirt. Please do not buy this shirt. It will ruin your life."
3,Agree with previous review,"I must agree with the reviewer from Singapore - in the 70s, Cilla Black's singing style changed, and perhaps not for the better. Her voice became softer, lighter and more airy. Gone was the soulfulness and vibrancy of her 60s recordings. Many of her 70s recordings were poor adult contemporary songs that were dull and listless. Some of the production sounds very dated now. This CD may feature a number of Cilla recordings that have not been available on CD before but they exist more for curiosity sake rather than an enjoyable listen."
4,"Truly, a western classic","""Rex Barlow, Montana Marshal"" is a very well written western novel in the tradition of Larry McMurtry, Louis L'Amour, J. Frank Dobie and other authors of this caliber. John A. Robinson is one of those story tellers who has the unique ability to literally take the reader's mind to some specific place and time as his story dictates. He makes the reader feel as if they are present in his story. I have had the pleasure of actually meeting Mr. Robinson in a 'just by chance' situation. I have the feeling that John A. Robinson could just as well have been Rex Barlow had he been born a couple of generations earlier."
4,Good Product,"I just want to share my opinion about this product, even at the first time I was sureprised that it's made in China but fourtunately it works so fine with my Macbook 13.3"". My laptop is faster now with even opening and working multiple applications in the same time."
1,worthless,"I tried this chip along with the 1 GB DDR to increase the memory on my 2008 late version I-Mac and nither one of them worked. So goes trying to save a buck, you get what you paid for."
1,Went Bad in 3 Months,"I bought this RAM and installed it with no problem. However, after three months the computer crashed all of a sudden with no warning. The screen went blank and it appeared the hard drive or video card had gone bad. The people at Apple were no help and just said bring it in for repairs. However, the repair department guy at Best Buy said it sounded like the RAM may be bad. After I put the old RAM back in, the computer works normal again. I am probably out the money I paid for it since it took 3 months to be defective. I hope others will learn from this."
4,Woks great,Needed a little more Ram and this did the trick. Very easy to install in my Mac ! Try it.
1,slowed down my imac..,"After installing my imac recognized it but it slowed down my computer significantly. Some programs would take minutes to start up and then would run very slowly, lagging a lot. Then the computer would freeze and have to restart. Upon restart, my imac made a loud beeping noise and would not start. After removing the memory stick my computer was back to normal."
1,The Witches' Hammer,"Ok...I'll give almost anyone one star for merely being able to get a book published. Sorry in this case I think it was more like half a star! The story idea was good, but the writting was too simplistic, some of her details I could do withought like all the smoking and the color of peoples teeth. Sorry I read it to the end, I try to do that with every book, and the end was greatly disappointing as well. I've read no other work by this author, but this may just stear me clear if this is an example."
3,Very Interesting,"While I did enjoy The Witches Hammer to a great degree, I did notice a certain sense of ""this is not a well written book"" for reasons I am not educated enough to point out. However, I'd recomend this to a number of people, and don't do that with many books of this type that I have read. Also, for research reasons I'd really like to get in touch with the author, or if the research done for the book wasn't done by the auther, whoever did the research. If anyone has a lead on this issue, I'd really like to hear from you. Thanks!-crystalcut"
4,Inspiring (and unbiased),"I feel the need to counter the negative review that claims bias. It is that review that is biased, not this book. The book presented both the negative and the positive. The book did not claim that Livingstone was the first to see Victoria Falls and it did not castigate the Africans for any lack of reception. In fact, I'd say it showed that the Africans were quite receptive to Livingstone. One wanted to follow him and die at his feet.David Livingstone endured such hardship that I was greatly inspired and challenged. I highly recommend this book."
1,DISJOINTED FACTS! FULL OF BIAS!!,"The true story which this book is supposed to be telling was corroded by bias, which paved way for fictitious lies and assumptions. First and foremost, David Livingstone was not the first person to discover Victoria Falls. The native Africans who knew the Falls before him, were the ones that led him to its location.Also, castigating Africans for not trusting and loving him at-the-first-sight was very unfair. It showed how myopic the author, (Sam Wellman), and the reviewer, (Hazel Rochman), are. Both men must be joking if they assumed that readers have forgotten that Dr. Livingstone entered Africa at a period when the aim of 99.9% of Europeans who went there was to abduct and sell Africans into slavery.This book is dying for a revision. It will be an interesting piece if all the facts and figures are frankly accounted for."
4,What a great book for Christmas Reading,"I received this book as a pre-Christmas book many years ago and have just finished reading it for maybe the fifth time just before Christmas. It is a very quick and engaging read.The Christmas Letters recounts all of the bittersweet memories that surround Christmas. It is not necessarily all happy, but it is all very real. Maybe as I get older, the pathos of Christmas becomes more real - both the sadness associated with memories of the past which can no longer be recreated and the realization that we can only celebrate from that place where we currently live in our lives. When we are in good places, then Christmas is magical. When not, Christmas can be very difficult. Smith touches on both of these points.I am a great fan of Lee Smith's books. I gave this one only 4 stars, but that is in relation to her other books. To me, her best is Fair and Tender Ladies, also written in letter form.Christmas blessings to all."
2,Interesting,This book was a nice fast read. Not sure if I would recommend to my friends or not but it was interesting.
5,A Wonderful Look at a Family over Generations,"Three generations of women write letters to family members and friends, usually at Christmas. The letters reflect the social conditions at the time they are writing. Birdie begins in 1944; Mary in1967, and Melanie in 1996. The writers also share recipes, which become increasingly complex. The time span covered allows mother's expectations for and understanding of their children to be reflected in the reality of the next generation.This is not a 'gushy' Chirstimas book, but a worthwhile read, especially as you sit down to write or read this year's Christmas letters."
4,Three women share the true story behind their Christmas letters,"This short little book may start like a sappy, Hallmark movie, but it ends like a Nancy Meyer's film, with brutal honesty and humor wrapped around the three main women and their families. Suitable for women of all generations."
4,interesting,"A very short book in the form of a collection of Christmas letters. Because of the unusual structure of the book you get glimpses of this family over three generations.Very unusual, very good. I personally didn't like it quite as much as Oral History or Family Linen (other Smith books), but it was definitely worth the time and money. Recommended."
2,Disappointing,"I actually enjoyed reading this book until I reached the end. I was reading it around Christmas, and it really made me think about what's happened to me this year. It's a quick read, which was nice- I read it in 2 sittings. I also enjoy reading books that are set in North Carolina such as this.However, the ending was very disappointing. I don't want to reveal it here in case you do decide to check this out. Yet I was reading this book to get in a good Christmas mood, and I wanted a happy ending. I didn't get it here. It's also a bit misleading to say that the letters are from three generations of women, since the third generation only contributes one letter."
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,"While this book was FULL of holiday sentiment, it was TOTALLY SIMPLISTIC with what seemed like only a paragraph on every other page. (only half of the book's 73 pages) I am a romantic and a sentimentalist but, I do not have money to simply throw away for someone else's profit. If the book had been priced at $4.95, I would have considered it worthwhile but, I paid $9.95 only to have insult added to injury with a price reduction of more than $1.00. There are many OTHER BOOKS that offer FAR MORE VALUE for the money. SO, If you value your money, DON'T WASTE IT ON THIS BOOK !!!"
3,More What than How,"The author being a lawyer seems to give the bare minimum information. You are told what you can do, but how to do it is often left out. Numerous times in the book the author says, ""for more info you should consult a lawyer.""Example: You are told how you can have single member llc's owned by one multiple member llc. Yet you are not told how you would go about preparing the arcticles of the llc to do so.Example 2: The section on taxes for your llc is very short and leaves many questions.P.S. I'm a bad speller."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"After reading this book and implementing Mary's plan, my husband and I were able to organize our credit and shorten our payments from 15 years down to 5! We are two years into it, and only have three more to go before we are debt free. I cannot express how great this book is. Mary addresses how to live without using credit, how to pay off the credit you do have, and how to make sure you don't need to fall back on credit in the future. She suggests in the book to use her website to plan your payments on current debt. It costs $20 to enroll, and I would highly reccomend it. It allows you to plug all your debt into the worksheet, and it tells you which bills to pay first, second, etc to get the debt payed off the fastest. Well worth the $20!"
5,Mary Hunt is right on!!,I heard the author give her testimony on a christian program so I thought I would give her book a chance. I am glad I did. I have never been able to handle my money. I guess you could say I was reckless. The book is easy to read and Ms. Hunt is funny too. She has been there and done it with debt. She tells you how to dig your way out. There is light at the end of the tunnell. I guess the most aspiring thing about this book is she really seems sincere. I think she really does want us debt free. If we will follow her advice that is possible.
5,FINALLY...We Have a Plan!,This book has given us a clear view of when we will be out of debt. With a plan you can do anything...just have to stick to it! And the best part...the book pays for itself in no time if you choose to utilize the information contained in it.
4,Good information for homeowners,"This is the second book I've read by Mary Hunt. I found The Complete Cheapskate to be more helpful for me--nearly half of Dept Proof Living has to do with mortgages, cars, etc. As our housing is provided as a benefit of my husband's job (he is a pastor), and our cars are paid for, I only skimmed most of the second half of the book. If you are just beginning your Rapid Debt Repayment Plan, I would recommend The Complete Cheapskate first. I intend to use the info in this book later, when we are completely out of debt, and we CAN start saving to buy a retirement home!"
5,Create Financial Freedom,"This is an excellent book that I really don't want to put on my bookshelf, now that I've read and grown a great deal from it.Ten years ago, I read, ""The Complete Cheapskate,"" by Mary Hunt. And, I remember having said to myself, back then, ""Well, yeah. Those are nice ideas, but ...""Having read many great finance books that focus upon the psychological aspects, I'm happy to say that I am applying and greatly benefitting from Mary Hunt's money management guidance."
5,Millionaires in the making 1st step,"For those who want to be millionaires or just want to be able to retire without money plaguing them, this is the starting point. Mary takes you through understanding what is wrong, why it's wrong, how to fix it, keep it fixed and then how to get started on the road to ""never worry about money again"". How much more can you ask for from one book that is written in clear and simple language? Whether you know a bit about finances or you are just trying to keep from crashing and burning, this book can help. And the price is A LOT less than a financial planner would charge to tell you the same thing."
5,Very well Written and very useful,"This book is very well written and provides common sense information that can be used by everyone, regardless of your financial situation. I have already begun using the principles in the book with my finances."
5,A Great Help!,"I bought this book and have since loaned it out to several friends. For me, the greatest help was Mary's 80-10-10 plan. The idea is to live off of 80% of your salary, save 10% and give 10% to charity or tithe. I was never taught this concept and found it helpful. She also tells you how to pay your credit cards off 1 at a time. If you feel like you are treading water, about to drown in debt-- this book will rescue you IF you follow the advice."
5,Everyone NEEDS this book...it's fantastic...,"I have read this book over and over again. It is a fantastic roadmap to a healthy way to manage your home finances. It is simple, clear, easy and you can do it. I have not used my credit card in 3 weeks!! You assign yourself a FREEDOM ACCOUNT (all those expenses that happen during the year ie Christmas, gifts, yearbooks, clothing, dues, etc.), CONTINGENCY ACCOUNT (your safety net for job loss or loss of income) and a checking account (daily bills). I am in charge of our home finances and now I feel like I am doing my husband proud. I never felt that way before. I was just winging it with a little credit there, a little splurge here, never giving myself a way to save for those unexpected needed expenses. I hope everyone goes out and buys it. You will NOT be disappointed."
4,Motivating,"Mary Hunt is very encouraging and motivating in her book, Debt-Proof Living. She makes you feel as if she is on your side. Her principles of giving, saving, and managing are solid. Following the plan to being debt-free will make you feel much better about yourself than using someone else's money (credit) ever will. After reading this, I realized that although our culture wants you to believe that using credit is a normal way of life, it is not acceptable or healthy. Thank you, Mary Hunt, for your counter-culture attitude! Hopefully more people will break free from credit card debt, and start ripping up those E-Z credit applications, stuffing them back into the envelopes, and sending them right back to the credit card companies. It's time to say NO MORE!"
5,Debt Proof Living,"I really love this book. I wish I had read it about 20 years ago, so that I could have rid myself of debt long ago. She speaks to the reader in an folksy style and hits home on issues that faces us all today. I believe in her guidelines of giving 10% of your income to God, 10% to yourself and manage the rest. I know God has come through with money when I least expected it and needed it the most."
4,Great resorce,Simple to read and follow. Shows you how to work with what you have and get out of debt. I have given this book as a gift to every young couple I know..
4,Debt-Proof Living,Lots of helpful information and can be used in coordination with website. I am looking forward to updating my finances.
3,NOT About STAYING Out of Debt,"Based on the book cover and quick reviews, this book is not what I expected. If you are expecting good advice on how to GET out of debt, this is a good book (probably five stars). However, if you are expecting good advice on how to STAY out of debt, this is not a good book (probably one star). There are hardly any about STAYING out of debt, so I was really looking forward to it. The search continues for such a good book...."
2,Dissapointed,"I have to say that I am dissapointed in this book. From the reviews that I read I thought it would be great but it really isn't what I was looking for. I'm finding Mary's book has mostly common sense and some information that I definately was not looking for. She mentions how giving 10% of your money away will connect you with ""God"" and a few other things about how it will enhance your relationship with ""God"". This is okay for some people but if it's not what you're looking for you should probably skip this book. I am going to spend some more time looking to see if there are some hidden bits of wisdom in here... I guess my advice overall would be that if you are looking for something intellectual/educating, are familiar with budgeting/banking/savings techniques, and are wise about your money, even if you do have debt, this isn't the book for you."
2,Not much useful information here,"Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense. There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category. She also repeats herself constantly. The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over. This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money. The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well."
1,Debt-Proof Living is not Goof-Proof,"I found this book to be adequate but it only re-invented the wheel. I read the preview chapter on line and should have known it was a mistake to borrow the book. Also, the grammar, capitalization and spelling contained glaring errors. I would not recommend it."
2,"God this, God that","Can't people just write self-help books anymore without throwing God into the picture?? This is just another example of Christian authors trying to push their values onto others. The author suggests that we give away 10% of our income, and that connects us to God? I don't think so. And besides, if I'm buried in debt and am having financial problems, am I really in a position to just give away 10% of my hard-earned money? I think not! If I make $2000 per month, I'm supposed to give away $200? Maybe when I'm OUT of debt, I'll be in a better position to donate, help the homeless, or aid some other cause.This book lost credibility from the get-go."
3,"Thick, smelly plastic","I was actually expecting a metal one, and was disappointed when I got this. It's been over a week and I can't get rid of the plastic odor (tried washing and drying several times now). I'm not likely to drink from it anytime soon, even though it seems to be safe (has the recycyling symbol 2 - HDPE on the bottom) [...]Perhaps I'll use it just for decoration for some time first."
5,Bob at his Best,"this is an excellent album. it is a compilation of the best Bob Marley songs. whether you are just starting a collection or you are ending one, this is a must have."
3,Rebel Music Vol. 2,"While there are great songs on this CD (from Bob Marley how can they be otherwise), I was somewhat disappointed for two reasons: 1. the 1986 release of Rebel Music was meant to show the ""political"" side of Bob Marley and although there were only 10 songs it accomplishes that purpose; this CD duplicates two songs (Crazy Baldheads and So Much Trouble In The World) from that set and they could have used other songs; 2. The original rhythm tracks for Iron Lion Zion and Keep On Moving were eliminated and ""contemporary"" tracks (circa 1992) were created instead; one wonders if Bob would have approved (the original tracks can be heard on the box set Songs Of Freedom).Don't get me wrong; these songs are required listening. But I think you'd do better either with the box set (now back in print!) or his individual CDs."
4,Flogging a dead (but still relevant) horse...,"I love Bob Marley dearly, and obviously I'm not alone, since ""Legend"" is perpetually on the back order list, and for very good reason; song for song it's probably the best compilation of all time.This album picks up the thread, and is in no way inferior, except that most of Bob's albums are worth getting; these compilations should be aimed at the layman who doesn't know about or doesn't really care to spend the money on a complete catalogue.That being said, the only reason this compilation doesn't get 5 stars from me is the tasteless hawking of merchandise within the liner notes. It's okay on rap albums where fashion is half the allure, but not on what's basically real art."
1,Bad item,"Either my soil is the same moisture and ph, ALL the time, this item is not good. I used it a couple of times and rendered it useless."
1,Wacks self with hammer,"Agree with Mr. Moore, thing is stuck on ph 7. Have tried Diet Pepsi (ph 3.2) and milk (ph 6.3) and it doesnt budge. Milk does show a ""C"" on the moisture meter."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This is just too technical for me. You have to refer to a chart and know the technical name of your plants in order to know whether or not it needs water. It doesn't just say ""dry"" or ""wet"" which is what I was really looking for. I'd say this is for someone who is way more serious and technical about their houseplants than I. I'll be getting a cheaper more basic one."
4,Works well...usually,"Usually gives a ballpark reading of moisture. Sometimes seems not to work so well, not sure if it's soil type in question or what? But I'd recommend it as a quick checker."
2,great while it lasted...,Used it for about 5 days before it died on me. The soil moisture part still works for me but i needed it more so for the pH part and it doesn't work anymore. It's forever stuck on 7 now. It's also rather fragile and comes apart easily. I do not recommend this product at all! Try a different one. This one is poorly made.
2,pH Meter,"Easy to use but hard to understand. When you figure out how to use it with predictable results, please post the method."
4,USE ONLY IN SOIL! NOT LIQUIDS!,"The people who tested it in milk and orange juice did not read the instructions. Mine say clearly that this is NOT designed to test water or other liquids, but rather soil and damp, but not liquid situations.to quote from the packaging: USE THE METER ONLY IN SOIL. DO NOT PLACE THE PROBES INTO WATER!!Yes, all in caps. I guess some folks aren't literate."
2,Inaccurate,"Based on my experience with this meter so far, I wouldn't recommend it for serious gardening, because it is quite inaccurate. Compared against a professional meter (that I eventually purchased later!), the rapitest meter reading is often off by as much as 1.5 - 2.0 points. Also, the reading seems to vary wildly depending on the moisture and temperature.Do not be tempted by the cheap price. The meter may appear to be functioning but the result is likely so far off that you end up compensating your soil PH in the wrong direction."
1,stuck,"I bought two of these, one the dual type and also the single. The dual always reads 7 and the single is stuck on 6. They don't work."
5,Heady remembrance,"I first heard this record driving to work on the Taconic Parkway in 1989. Memorable songs are like familiar smells, they heighten the awareness of your emvironment so you can immediately capture a time and a place. The lyrical imagery and 0 to 100 dB instrumental dynamics seem to play on this. ""Take Good Care Of It"" with its frenzied allusions to Camel cigarettes and ""Bird-Dog"" with its climactic singalong to imported German beer. These are real compositions, no producer listed."
5,Excellent ensemble practice tool for more advanced djembe students,"This DVD is a great learning tools for folks who have been playing West African djembe and/or dununs for a little while. Each drum is demonstrated individually, and then you can play along on your drum, switching to different parts. Parts can be viewed/played individually or in ensemble form. Covers a nice range of rhythms. A must-have for students of West African rhythms, together with Mamady Keita's three-volume DVD practice series, ""Guinee: Les Rhythmes Du Mandeng."""
4,Purple Pleasure,"Vibrant purple bathmat with very secure footing. The surface was annoyingly stiff at first, but mellowed out after about a week. And so beautiful! Maybe a trifle small."
1,poor quality,"A gift for my girlfriend...she tried them on and one of the pearl strands broke, she was able to sew it back together...tried on again, another broken strand....she had to repair all pearl strands....very disappointed...very poor quality"
1,This material is a plagiarism,"Sorry to say: This material is a plagiarism and a legal case. It's an unofficial translation of the German 4th Edition (1946-1950). The Original Work is based on Ludwig Rudolph and Herrmann Lefeldt's work - NOT on Alfred Witte - who died some years ago in 1941. The official(!) English Translation of the 5th(!) German Edition was published by Ludwig Rudolph (Witte-Verlag) in 1974. This official Edition was republished 1990 by our contract-partner Penelope Pub. in Florida. Save a lot money and buy official material. You can check this information on the NYC Public Library Website, just input ""Alfred Witte""."
1,NiCastro is no Plutarch or Arrian,If you want to read about Alexander you start with Plutarch's The Age of Alexander or Arrian's Penguin Classics Campaigns Of Alexander where one can learn real history and not some fictuous non sense found in this book from Nicastro's pathetic attempt to write history.
2,flawed historical fiction,"As the other reviewer said, the author really goes out of his way to make you hate Alexander the Great. I suspect that most of the stories in here that depict him as such a bad person are the author's own hare-brained fabrications as well. Not that I would want to read a panegyric either, but this work just has no respect for the guy.I give it 2 stars because the prose was enjoyable and I liked the Machon character."
4,4.5 stars,"The book is a narrative of the adulthood of Alexander as seen by an onlooker. Here, the legendary general is only a man. Many of the rumors and legends surrounding Alexander are explained away and a complex, flawed man is revealed to us. This Alexander is still a genius, and still Great, perhaps even Greater as hte picture that is painted is plausible as a man. It is, however, definately historical FICTION."
5,Fabulously Written Book,"In a courtroom in ancient Athens, a companion of Alexander must prove that the charges that he corrupted ""god"" Alexander are false.The author's original uncanny characterization, soaring battlefield depictions, and flamboyant events of that era are beautifully portrayed. I definitely recommend this book and believe that the non-historical readers will enjoy it as well."
4,Finally!,"Professor Horsley has repeatedly offered us books impeccably researched and annotated in great detail. Yet despite the promise of those works, Horsley has too often hidden his gifts behind an impenetrable wall of technicalities and minutia. In his attempts to demonstrate his intelligence, Horsley has sometimes made his writing obtuse and inaccessible to the average reader.This, however, is not one of his failures. Here Horsley finally gets it right. Here Horsley fulfills the promise of his other works.Examining the politics, sociology, psychology and religion of the renewal movements founded by John the Baptist, Jesus of Nazareth, and Paul of Tarsus, Horsley and Silberman weave an exhilarating narrative that exposes the historical roots of Christianity. Thoroughly comprehendible by the lay reader, without sacrificing scholarship, this book demonstrates that the authors can strike an appropriate balance between academia and popular reading."
4,"Surprised, but not disappointed","I can't agree with any of the previous customer negative reviews at all. This CD may not have a cutting edge here as with ""Somewhere in Patterson"", but RS still strings along fantastic melodies and cutting edge lyrics. My favorites are ""Hazel's House"" and ""The Last Fare of the Day"". Two songs that should tug on anyone's heartstrings. Both songs weave a tale about life, family and the delicate balance of humanity through the interaction of strangers and family. This CD is filled with the quieter, gentler side of RS's music. A definite buy for any hard core RS fan."
5,Sultry,"From the first song to the last, Richard Shindell has a natural ability to compose and perform with strength and softness simultaneously. This is one of my favorite recordings.Beautiful !"
5,For the songwriter aficionado,"Richard Shindell has some of the most insightful compositions out there. Not every cut on this album is a gem, but enough of them are to make it a classic for the audio library.I like Hazel's House, Che Guevara T-Shirt, There Goes Mavis and So Says The Whipporwill best, but I can understand others choosing other selections as their faves. Two or three of the songs on this album are bound to stick with you.This is an acoustic, singer/song writer style of album. If you're into heavy handed production, go elsewhere."
5,investigating into a good book,"I loved this book. All of the excitment, puzzeling information, and thoughts of being prejudiced all in one book. Like when Hiram's grandpa wemt to the White Citizens Concils. Nobody in the Mississippi Delta really wanted to desegrigate. They mainly based all of their beliefs on the old southern ways.Not many people even cared when a ""Negro"" (as they say it, but we just would like to see them as other people)boy came up missing. To see what really happened you'll have to read this great book. Then there was all of the trouble hiram was trying to figure out between his dad and grandpa. He finally had some idea of what it was in the end though. Hiram always got along with his grandpa when he was young so, he really didn't know why his father didn't. Hiram loved to go with his grandfather fishing on the Tallahatchie River.To find out more on this great book just go out and read it."
2,boring book,"If I wasn't required to read this book, I wouldn't have gotten past the first 108 pages, which drag on and are utterly boring. While reading Missisippi Trial, I was either yawning or grimacing at the sickening images this book creates.There must be some other way to learn about desegregation in the south! It is an interesting topic, but unfortunately, it is a terribly written book."
3,Unoriginal,"This novel, Mississippi Trial, 1955 is a fictionalized account of the actual events that happened around the murder of Emmett Till. However, many of the plot elements are unoriginal and very similar to To Kill a Mockingbird."
4,Life Changing Book,"Have you ever felt like you and your dad never got along? Well that's how someone in this book felt, Hiram Hillburn. He lived with his Grandma and Grandpa until his parents got out of college they left to Arizona including Hiram, right after his grandma died.Hiram was always eager to go back and live in Mississippi with his Grandpa and see the love of his life, Naomi. His dad said that it's a bad place to live. Mostly because how they treat blacks. His dad finally let him go back during summer. Things were happening to a certain black. The black was murdered and a trial was started. There is only one question though, guilty or not guilty.There is no way that I could not have say I disliked this book. The book gives you emotions and thought. It kind of makes you look at life a little differently. I hope you would feel the same way."
5,"MIssissippi Trial, 1955","This compelling historical fiction novel by Crowe recounts the tragic murder of a teenage boy named Emmit Till an african-american boy visiting his uncle. The story is seen through the eyes of 16 year old Hiram who, when comeing back to Greenwood begins to see it differently then the perfect childhood home he had always remembered. He begins to understand his fathers veiws on the south and racism. It was written well I couldn't put it down!By SROB"
3,The Raving Review,"The Raving ReviewHiram Hillburn loves spending time with his Grandma and Grandpa down in Greenwood, Mississippi. But then his Grandma dies and Hiram's parents decide to move to Tempe, Arizona. Then in the summer of 1955 when Hiram is 16, his parents decide to let him go back to Greenwood. But Hiram feels it is not the same Greenwood that he remembered as a young boy. Then a young African-American boy is murdered because of an ugly racial incident. Hiram is starting to learn why his father was trying to not let him go.I liked the book for the most part, though there were a few parts I didn't care for, like when Hiram witnessed the ugly racial incidents. This book is based on real events. So, if you like true stories that are part of our country's history like this, then I would recommend this book to you. The author did a good job of making this book very descriptive. I give it 3 out of 4 stars.By: Adam ..."
5,Outstanding- any kid would love,This was a great book for my 6 year old! It inspired him to look for treasure and provided real life stories of folks who found great treasure.... read it!
5,This deserves 5 not 4,"This movie is so good! Time travel,romance,comedy,wild transformations galore. A wonderful parody/drama of ""Journey to the West"".. Steven Chow was a perfect choice for the Monkey god/king ...Plus Yammie Nam shines as the Spider Woman. You won't believe what you're seeing the first time you watch it. Both films are great..but the first one deserves 5 stars for getting you in to Part 2 in the first place."
2,A messy Odyssey,"Chinese Odyssey, Part 1, is a very wacky period adventure...you'll be forgiven if you end up at the end no wiser than the beginning. Stephen Chow is Joker, whom two female demons (one, Jingjing, who is in love with him) is convinced is the reincarnation of Sun Wukong, the Monkey God of Chinese classic Journey to the West. While it must be congratulated for giving the centuries-old classic a novel spin, there's just too much repetition, wackiness and messiness to ensure this a smooth ride; the jokes are mainly slapstick, and could well be removed without hurting the ramshackle plot at all. Best seen as a preparation to the much superior and emotionally satisfying Part 2, Cinderella."
3,"Funny, but no DVD features","An above average Hong Kong comedy, with some really funny scenes. The emphasis is on physical comedy, so the fact the subtitles are often unreadable is not a problem. The usual cheesy Hong Kong ""special effects"" only add to the fun. But I found this to be a disappointing DVD purchase--there is nothing on the DVD but the movie, and even that does not appear to have been remasterd in any way. So, if you can find a tape version at a lower price, go with the tape--whoever put this on DVD did it with the minimum amount of effort."
5,reiterate: it is a cult classic,"It is the best of best among Stephen Chow's movies. (Both Part One and Part Two)It's not only the slapstick style of humor which is sort of typical in his movies, the conversations in the movie are funny and brilliant too.Again no English subtitle version can do justice to its full wit and flavor, which, I guess, a Chinese version of Woody Allen's movie would be terrible in this respect too.Like the effect of some childhood rhyme that everyone remembers, to break the ice among a group of Chinese college students, just recite some words from this movie or sing the ""Only you"" song from it, you can bring the joy that will immediately spread and light up everyone. Guaranteed! It is a cult."
4,Two friends,"Many will know Simenon for his detective novels, which are among the best of the genre. Rather less will have read his ""straight"" novels, of which The Girl With A Squint is one.Simenon covers familiar literary ground in this story of two friends-- one plain and the other beautiful-- but the familiarity is never tired, and although slight it is certainly worth the time to read."
2,Nothing much happens,"OK, I must be really shallow, but I kept waiting for something to happen. It never does."
4,INFORMATIVE,Book is a good beginning to learn about the Austrian Auxiliary troops during the years 1792-1816. It is an easy read and understand. If you are interested in the Uniforms of this time period it is very informative.
5,A welcome addition to the subject,"Having seen the quality, to use the word loosely, of the other works on the Austrian Army in the Osprey series, seeing one written by an authority on his subject makes a welcome change. The author compliments his highly informative work with a number of contemporary uniform illustrations either previously unpublished or otherwise very difficult to find. Those that rely on later tertiary sources will, of course, have a problem with that, but then there are always those who prefer myth to history."
1,"Great pictures, not so great content","If you want a wine book that has great photos this would fit the bill. If you also want a wine book that is very short on substance this is a good choice.As an introductory text, ""Wine: An Introduction"" leaves a lot out. As a professional sommelier this was my very first text book and I must say that this book did not cover the basics of wine well at all.The book only covers the top 6 main varietal grapes in a moderate level beginner of detail. The rest get anything from a sentence to possibly two paragraphs. Very little information about regions, regional styles, vinification, or the industry surrounding wine makes an appearance.Want to know about grapes? Try buying ""Vines, Grapes & Wines"". Want to know about regions try ""The World Atlas of Wine"". Both are availible on Amazon.com. Both are much, much better books at helping you find your bearings in the stormy seas of wine."
2,Not great,"As mentioned by another reviewer, the organization of this book was not ideal. I was disappointed, because usually Simon is a terrific writer. I do like the visual richness of DK books but found their ""French Wines"" by Robert Joseph to be far superior to this one; wonderful to look at AND to learn from."
3,untitled,"check out this band's video on youtube...it is excellent & fun...but this cdr (yes, this is a compact disc recordable), make sure your cd player will play a cdr before you buy."
2,NOT a U2 Album!,"If you're looking for a U2 album this is not it. Passengers is really just a side project in electronic music, and a poor one at that. Some songs like ""Miss Sarajevo"" have some appeal, but most are moody, rambling, and not a joy to listen to. If you want classic U2 look elsewhere."
4,Something Quite Special,"This is really quite special, a marriage of U2's pop sensibilities and Brian Eno's ambient techniques. The disc as a whole is outstanding. I particularly enjoy listening to it at night, as it feels a little ""dark"".My two favorite tracks are Miss Sarajevo (featuring a bit by Luciano Pavoroti) and ""Elvis Ate America""When listening to this I have often had people comment that they like it, want to know who it is, and whether I know where they can buy a copy."
5,This unique album is one of my favorite discs,"This is the most unique music U2 has done. If you want to be shocked by the diversity this band has displayed over their career, play ""Out of Control"" off of Boy and then crank up ""Your Blue Room"" off this album.Passengers makes for great listening, especially when you're feeling a little moody. It's a great disc and a must for any real U2 fan."
4,Should be a part of your U2 collection.,"Passengers real and imagined film soundtracks expands on the musical concepts brought forth in Zooropa. Its good to hear U2 wandering into experimental territory with Eno at the helm. Who better to bring the lads into the ambient realm than the man who invented the gerne? The album works! This is an interesting listen with moments of subtle moodiness and rocking, get your booty up beats. Listen to after a long night of clubbing or use as your late night insomnia-net surfing soundtrack. A worthy addition to all electronica fans collections."
4,"Its different, but very good",The song *Slug* ... is worth the price of admission. It's virtually a prayer ... a wanting to keep himself in line .. so that his woman will appreciate him. It's a classic representation of the struggle within men.
5,Don't pass this up!,"This is one of those sleepers that people don't know about, but when they hear it, they want it! Bono of U2, as well as Luciano Pavarotti, Brian Eno, and others have created one of the best ambient compilations. Where some compilations don't blend with other tracks, this cd smoothly melds each into the next song. All the tracks are fantastic examples of a cd done right. There was some talk of a follow up cd, so I only hope that the next will be as good as this!"
4,Actually a movie soundtrack...,"Being an Eno fan, and not so much of a U2 fan, this album proves that with the production of a genius(Eno), U2 can be a great artistic band. However, there are at least two songs on ""Passengers"" that are ACTUALLY IN A MOVIE! The movie is called, ""Beyond the Clouds,"" a foreign film of shorts directed by John Malkovitch. The short within the movie, ""Par-Dela Les Nuages,"" (which also stars Malkovitch) has two tracks off of this album, ""Beach Sequence,"" and ""Your Blue Room."" The movie was relased in 1995, the same year as ""Passengers."" So, to correct some people who think that this is an ""imaginary"" soundtrack album, that is not altogether true."
3,Eh,"I bought it not really knowing ANYTHING about it, and surprise! I'm disappointed! It has no instructions for use, the bottom is the same thickness as the sides, even on a low heat you cannot use it on an actual stovetop, because it makes a hideous noise while heating, mine now has scorch marks all over the inside bottom, amazing since there was only water in it. Works pretty well on a hot plate, no weird sounds, but it's huge, so it's really slow to heat up."
4,Rowin' down the edutainment river,"I first played this game when I was young. This game is fairly educational involving animal Identification, problem solving and even some diplomacy when working with the native people. It can be a little boring, especially when all you are doing is rowing down the river for a while. But if you are really good at it, you can beat the game very quickly. It doesn't have too much of a replay value though, which is a bit of a dissapointment.There were a few technical problems with the game. I have a newer computer and noticed that many of the animations didn't work too well and that the game would occasionally crash after a while. All in all a decent game worth a couple hours of play. Very educational too!"
1,Horrible Game,"I had high hopes for this game since Oregon Trail was such a good game. This game was a major disapointment, and extremly boring. It was as if it was written by a completely different company. Do not waste your money on this game, but I do recommend Orepgon Trail."
2,An Actual Description,"This is a hard plastic case that clips over the outside of your phone. The outside is a faux leather, made of plastic that looks convincing enough. All told it is an acceptable choice, trendy."
1,"Utter garbage, not even worth the paper it's printed on","This book is so terribly written, I can not even bring myself to give it away, let alone sell it on to somebody else. It is poorly written and edited. It has a chapter on how to use search engines such as PubMed. Surely if you are sitting this subject, you have already had considerable exposure to search engines and databases, so what the author tells you here will be nothing new, not to mention his description of using booleans in searches is very confusing. Consider another text or read what you can on the WWW. Save your money for something less frustrating."
2,No help,"Well, after reading this book twice I still don't know how to play bridge. This says a lot about how useful this book is for a total newbie, since I'm not really dumb or anything.If you already know something about bridge, this book could help you play better, to something akin to the advanced beginner level."
2,Not really a beginner's book,"This book is neither a neither a beginner's book nor is it appropriate for idiots. It may be okay for someone who knows bridge and needs a refresher.Rather than starting simple, and giving the most important information, he mixes in trivia on rules. Instead of making a point and illustrating with several examples, he gives exceptions to the points and exceptions to the exceptions. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether an example is illustrating a point or is a counter example. There are no quiz questions with answers."
4,Dulcimer Player,"This book has a great selection of tunes and arrangements from a wide variety of artists whose music you might not otherwise be able to find. For the thoroughly ""paper trained"" player like myself, this is a treasury. Only one complaint: The binding makes it hard to keep the book open on the music stand."
2,Narrow and sensational perspective.,"Being a scholar of U.S.-Sino relations, I find all perspectives on the subject to be valid and valuable. Despite this, I find Lam's work, ""China: The Last Superpower - The Dragon's Hunger for World Conquest"", to be unfortunately sensational. Most importantly, the thesis assumes that the Christian anti-Christ story is not only factual but that its realization is nigh. Essentially, Lam suggests that the PRC government is the anti-Christ and the 'Christian West' must prepare for the end of times. The so called ""proofs"" given are a set of ambiguous historical claims and many blatant inaccuracies. Unless this erroneous 'doom's day' thesis is appealing to you, do not buy this book.Contrasting from my warning, I must add that if you are like me and wish to understand the many perspectives available then you might actually enjoy this curious, quick and often humorous read."
3,"Great songs, but a little repetitive.","Burning Spear is a great reggae singer, and this album certainly shows that. Unfortunately, all the songs begin to sound the same! There's simply not enough variation (as there is with a lot of his other albums) to make this a representative of Burning Spear as a whole. There are many jems, but not enough to make it an album you can put on 'repeat.'"
5,Pretty Cute,My wife and I thought it was pretty cute. It is very well illustrated and has an entertaining story.
5,A wonderful portrayal of long-distance love between a grandparent and grandchild.,"I am a long-distance grandmother, and ""The Giant Hug"" has grown on me. It is becoming one of my favorite picture books. Sandrah Horning puts a new spin on hugs, kisses, and faraway Grandmas. Valeri Gorbachev's delightful ""hugging animal"" illustrations accentuate the heartwarming text.A little pig named Owen wants to send a giant hug to his faraway Granny. ""Do you want to draw a picture of you hugging Granny?"" his mother asked.""No,"" Owen said. ""I want to send a real hug."" And so he does; with nine giant hugs being passed along through the postal system until the tenth one is delivered to Granny. The ending is a sweet and amusing surprise.Butterfly Kisses for Grandma and Grandpa"
3,Black Tiger Attacks!,"Robert Brace's debut novel was a fairly easy read. Black Tiger starts right up, and hardly slows down in both pace and intriguing mystery.About halfway through, the story stalls a bit, and never really has that full-out action assault ending I was hoping for. Interesting characters, although the main woman seemed a bit jaded and fake. Too James Bond-ish.But overall, this was a solid start to a series that I would purchase the new 2nd book that just came out."
3,If only the women could keep their clothes on,"Then we might buy this more. The action is not bad, but the women just shed their clothes upon meeting our hero. James Bond had to do some work to achieve the same result."
3,Servicable Saturday afternoon read,"A good, but not particularly compelling book. There are some funny lines and the story moves along briskly, but it's not great. It could have been better. It seems an odd criticism, but the book needed more graphic sex and a more charismatic hero. That might have made up for the by-the-numbers plot. Is it standard CIA procedure for agents to sleep with the people they're watching hours after meeting them? Are there actually CIA agents that are anything like Valentina? I think she needs her own series."
2,Implausible and Run of the Mill,"This cookie-cutter thriller is, at the same time, both implausible and entirely predictable. Our hero seems to have endless amounts of money, the luck to meet only stunning women, and the ability to get them into bed at all times. Sprinkled with the now-traditional tecnnical descriptions of a variety of firearms, the plot makes little sense and the characters are mere plot devices. For pure escapist reading, this book might be worth bringing on an airplane or to a doctor's waiting room."
4,Wonderful,This is a wonderful collection. The only piece I'm not crazy about his Abide with Me - this version is a bit dark for my taste. The celtic influence is stong which makes this suitable for background music at a gathering. I listen to this at least once a week while I work.
5,The Washington Manual of Ophthalmology,The essential guide for the resident ophthalmologist or ophthalmologist who wants all the essential information of ophthalmology in one small paperback. This is like having the entire BCSC series in one small book--but even better because only the essential facts are presented. This book is very well organized and finding information quickly is very easy. All the information is very up-to-date as well. No library is complete without this essential text.
2,Not very impressed,"While I'm not very impressed by the book in general - it's far from what my conception of 'encyclopedia' is, I am impressed by number of misprints/errors I came over shortly after opening the book. For example, I learned that the edge of space is at 1,025 kilmeters (page 331) and the first manned space flight was in April 12, 1959 (page 334). Will probably keep this book as a picture album because illustrations are rather nice."
2,2 stars only,This book is not really up to date as far as I am concerned!Mostly old stuff! Actually I wish I had gone to a book storeand reviewed what they have first hand. This is a lot of moneyfor its' worth!
2,If looking for an encyclopedia (Astronomy).. this is not the one.,"For the beginning astronomer, this is a fine place to start your journey. This is well written (with some noticed errors) and has beautiful illustrations. However, as a gift for a intermediate astronomer, this book was returned. The Universe (DK 2005) is a better starting book and as for an encyclopedia ... the choice goes to the four volume Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics (Institute of Physics 2001)."
3,Limited Manual,The manual is helpful for some easy repairs performed by most do-it-yourself type fixers. It is not the complete Chevy service manual. The pictures and such were good and the walk thru on the things I needed to change or repair were in the manual and the instructions were understandable.
5,Understanding the basics of a teenager's mind,"We all have to face this time when things change suddenly and we see our body changing fast while we are not children anymore but we can't be considered as adult people yet.However, we might forget about it, and even without forgetting this particular time in our lives, we might have not understood it quite well.Now we might face the time when we get to be parents: what will we do if our offspring is now a teenager? How to understand his/her behavior?Peter Blos gives good directions on how those common questions might be investigated, both for adults and teenagers. The reading of this book can help many people to understand what happens with teenagers observing the changes happening in their particularly mysterious and many times ritualistic world.Ideal for students of Psychology, but it can be read by virtually anyone."
3,No Methods-but interesting,"This book fulfills its' promise but if you want to learn to trade this is not the book for you. It does not pretend to be but the title is deceptive. It really is a look before you leap guide. It is hard to determine who wrote the book with so many contributing writers. I would recommend this book for those who know nothing about the subject and after you have read it you will know nothing about trading. But, you will know everything about the trading industry. The book should have been re-titled but then fewer people would have bought it."
5,Day Trading on the Edge : A Look-Before-You-Leap Guide,A great book that helps the reader understand the principles and key rules of day-trading. I found the information on the advantages and disadvantages of day-trading firms vs. trading from home most helpful as well as the steps for selecting a day-trading firm. The book is a GREAT educational tool for the day-trader and others interested in day-trading. I recommend this book to anyone thinking about day-trading.
3,"Good Book, If They Could Get The Author's Name Right","This book was fairly helpful to me. I noticed, however, the author's name is spelled differently in his bio and on the cover. Is this a publishing error? Otherwise, the book was good."
2,"Overpriced, lousy sound","I am a big fan of CAB in the studio. This double live cd set has fairly poor sound, though the playing is terrific. With better sound, it would have been fantastic. It sounds like an audience recording. Bunny Brunel sounds like Muddy Brunel. You can also clearly hear people talking off and on. One woman deserves credit on the album, as she is constantly jabbering away, except there are no liner notes. No matter which site you buy this set on, it is overpriced given the poor sound quality. Whoever authorized this thing to be released without a warning and at such a high price should be ashamed."
3,Silly and Fun,"The Sol Bianca is a interdimensional starship controlled by several female pirates. The women (and girl) are a little too contrived (they each have totally distinct personalities that separate them from each other--nothing in common), but the action is there and the anime is fairly good.The Sol Bianca and her crew have been raiding the pirate ships of Emporor Batros (typical space-anime name). In one of the raids, they find a small boy who has to get to one of the planets he rules to find his mother. He promises them that the emporor holds a treasure that has the secret of the human race as well as gold, jewels and cash. They jump at the situation.The emporor wants the Sol Bianca because it has a technology to go into subspace without a need for a hypergate, so the battle begins.If you are looking for the adult version of POWERPUFF Girls, try this one out. However, I do not think it is worth the money to buy it. Rating: C"
3,"Cute, But difficult to put together","I really liked the looks of this product, but it was very difficult to put together. It came in a million pieces and the directions where difficult to follow. I also wish it had blue caps to cover where the screws are. Looks great in the room though. :)"
1,bad book for beginners,"I agree with some of the users about how bad this book is. Good developers does not equate to being a good book writer. The authors may be great at programming but poor at presenting their knowledge to novice and intermediate users. This book was written not solely for web services as the title implies, so it is misleading to buyers of the book. It concentrates more on how .Net architecture should be designed in a theorical way. I didn't get anything helpful on web services, and will look at some other books or the net instead. If you are a hands-on learner, then this book is NOT for you, there is no full code that I can see."
3,Should Not Be Your First .Net Book,"I bought this book after reading the other reviews on this site. I have to say I was disappointed. The chapters are not very well organized, and all code samples are in C# ( which is fine if you're a C++ programmer, but pretty much useless if your background is VB). The download site DOES NOT provide VB versions of the code. I have read a lot of other how-to books related to ASP, XML, and XSL, and have consistently found books from WROX to be most useful. Next time, I'll stick to WROX."
5,A practical approach to .Net development,"This book gives one the sense that it was written by real developers, not academicians who never code for the real world. It covers the bases and shows why specific approaches work. Great help to get .Net coding off to a running start."
5,Technically superb,"It is a technically superb book. This book is best suited for any serious developer who wants to learn Web Services and .NET. It reads well, has concrete examples, and the examples works!This book covers a wide range of topics about this technology, starting off Part I with an overview of XML: XML Basic, XML Schemas, DOM, XSL, SOAP, and Web Services. Part II discusses .NET Framework: Common Language Runtime, .NET Framework Classes, Integrating SQL Server 2000 with .NET, ADO.NET. Part III goes into greater detail about building .NET applications: ASP.NET Web services, ASP.NET, and Windows applications. It even discusses how to debug .NET application!"
3,Read others first,"I was disappointed in Blood Orchid. I have read the entire Stone Barrington series and the Holly Barker series, as well, and I would definitely recommend reading Orchid Beach and Orchid Blues first. Blood Orchid was not as engaging as the others and Ham should have been included more. Also, it was so obvious who the ""bad guy"" was. I actually skimmed the last 20-30 pages of the book, just to get to the end and confirm my predictions; I have never done that before with a Woods book. The dialogue was unrealistic and I don't think it should have focused on Palmetto Gardens again. A disappointing read..."
1,Weak,"I'm not always able to figure out the ""bad guy"" in mysteries, but this one was so obvious as to be laughable. The characters (except for Daisy) are wooden and the whole plot is unrealistic and not worth your time."
3,"Nice action, weak plot","The MarginI like Woods' action scenes, and I like Holly Barker, she's a great female protagonist--smart, sexy and tough. But, this plot is weak and easily anticipated. Not a lot of mystery in this one.Chief Barker finds her house being bugged and chases the bugger off with the help of pilot instructor Ginny, Barker's father's girlfriend. There are the requisite murders, mob involvement, an uncooperative FBI head honcho to stir this mystery brew, and, of course, Barker is in the way. The Chief partners with an undercover FBI agent and together they unravel this who-done-it with ferve.This is not his best, by far, but it's an easy and sometimes exciting read.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin"
3,The Holly Barker series seems to be declining...,"Normally I'm a huge fan of this series, but as much as it pains me to say this I have to agree with some of the other reviews of this book. 'Orchid Beach' was so far the best book of the series, and 'Orchid Blues' wasn't half bad, but 'Blood Orchid' is nothing more than a light and fluffy read. Stuart Woods has taken a character who I admired as a strong and independant woman and turned her into something short of being a bimbo, with the FBI agent she hooked up with in 'Blood Orchid', and now in 'Reckless Abandon' she hooks up with Stone Barrington...I understand life goes on after the death of Jackson...but does that mean all of a sudden her life needs to revolve around sex with every new guy that comes in her life? What's next, her and Harry Crisp? I miss Jackson...Hoping the next book is better."
4,A refreshing change from Barrington boiler plates.,"Stuart Woods presents books which are very quick reads. I would highly recommend Sante Fe Rules, & L.A. Times. The early Stone Barrington novels were well developed with interesting characters and good tie-ins between books. However, the last 2 books in that series had serious flaws.The Holly Barker series is more along the lines of his earlier works. The characters are believable and well developed."
2,A first for me....,"I kept putting this book down and coming back to it at times. Usually I try to read a Woods book in one or two sittings, something that's easy to do given his short chapters.I just couldn't get into this plot, and I found that his sharp writing style had faltered in this one.I also found myself lacking in sympathy for any characters.I still like Woods' work, but he's going to have to pick it up a notch for me to keep getting his books in hardcover. Otherwise I'm going to be waiting for paperbacks."
1,what the???,"I LOVE Stuart Woods. I have read pretty near all of his books. However, this book bombed! WHY? Because it is just so far fetched it's unreal. Holly Barker is the chief of police in Orchid Beach, some small town that no one has ever heard of. She seems to go outside of her jurisdiction more in this book then five local cops do in a life time. She hooks up with an undercover FBI agent in the book, and trusts and relies on him, yet she doesn't even know what his undercover case is. It's just way too long and dragged out. During the first 4-5 chapters, you are able to figure out who the ""bad guy"" is, and you are forced to wade through 300 more pages of her not realizing it's him, and befriending him. Stick to Stone Barrington, he is at least more credible then this."
3,Not as good as previous books,"I am a big fan of Stuart Woods and have read most of his works including all since the mid-1990's. This is not as good as his previous Holly Barker or even Stone Barrington books. Like an earlier reviewer, I skimmed the last 20 or so pages as I was bored, which is very unlike Stuart Woods.I would still recommend this book but I expected more creativity: this book basically has already been written in an earlier book."
3,BLOOD ORCHID - DOESNT REALLY SMELL!!!!,"This is a first read by me of Stuart Woods. I found it an entertaining, quick read with a lot of constant action.Holly and Grant were very amusing. Daisy was my favorite. Very intelligent and added nicely to the plot. Yes, I knew almost immediately who the bad guy was but there was a surprise or two that I liked.By the time I flew from Tampa to Boston, this book was finished and enjoyed. It did not come up to my Dennis Lehane, Lee Child, Robert Crais standards but I liked it just the same. So there!!!!! :D :D :D"
4,Blood Orchid,"Well-plotted, decently written and diverting, I would say. Like the bulk of Woods' work, an easy to read. But when you have finished the text there appears a message from the author which is a pretty offensive; arrogant and condescending at very best. Read this BEFORE you buy the book, you may want to review your reading and purchasing loyalties -- vote with your wallet for an author that at least evidences respect for his sponsors."
3,Flordia Miasmia,"Stuart Woods has produced another forgettable novel that is great for filling the space that is left when filling a lunch hour or a couple of hours by the pool. An hour on the tread mill at the gym. Everytime I pick up one of his books I realize that I am mentally taking break from thinking.The plots are so predictable, the guy always gets the girl in the first 50 pages, and of course at the first meeting or so and it dosen't take much to figure where you are going to end up about a third of the way through.Still there is something to be said for the workmanlike craft and the space that is necessary to be filled between really good books"
3,"Fun Read, I enjoyed the book.",Fun read in the Holly Barker series. I recommend it for followers of the Holly Barker series. Lively and entertaining.
3,HOLLY BARKER **** BOOK THREE,"As with any series...read it in order. Stuart Woods series about Holly Barker, former military, now police chief in Orchid Beach, Florida, the third edition is BLOOD ORCHID. I found it an ok beach read, but indeed the weakest of the series so far. For a small town chief, Barker gets into some big cases and is in constant contact with Harry Crisp, head of the FBI in South Florida. Holly has her dad, Ham to help her and faithful companion, Daisey the Doberman. The stories are fun but this one was predictible. Series Recommended."
3,"Holly Needs to Get a Clue!Reviewer: Loves Thrillers, N.Y.C.","I added the ""N.Y.C."" to my title because I found out there was already a Thriller Lover. Sorry about that. Didn't mean to step on any toes!BLOOD ORCHID was some better than book 2 of the Holly series. It kept my interest, was a fast read, and didn't sag in the middle the way that BLUES did. However, there were some major flaws. Apparently I, along with all the other readers who wrote reviews, was able to spot the villain long before Holly did. You had to - there were no other viable candidates. That was the worst, but there were lots of other little inconsistencies and failures of common sense. Other reviewers have mentioned them, so I won't. But - shouldn't you remember to keep your cell phone charged when all the other phones are bugged and your life might depend on it? Just asking. Holly needs to sharpen up, or Mr. Woods needs to sharpen his plotting a great deal, especially if Holly is going to join the C.I.A."
4,very uplifting&Moving,the dancing was very uplifting.very Strong African vibe that has saved many lives. it's a very powerful form of dance&creativity. the Dance saves the soul&frees the mind to enhance&strive.this film takes you into so many areas.this film shows you the ups&downs&Makes no apologys about the situations involved. very moving.I enjoyed the many directions it has taken.
3,We Can Dance,"I enjoy a good dance movie and i think I must have been in that mode when this came out. I don't remember any of it really. I'm sure the dancing was impressive. I'm sure I was all hyped up on this for at least a couple of weeks. I'm sure that I checked out other dance(krumpin', break dancing and ballroom, in english and Japanese) movies and moved on to other dance movies that I liked better and watched more often. There ya go"
3,This movie was ok,"Not my type of movie but I watched it because I had to write a paper on it for my art class. Dance is considered a form of ""art""."
4,"when i ordered the dvd i choose the wrong definition, only can watch on the computer","if u like creative dance this is the video for u. only thing i could not watch on a Tv (which was a big disappointment)only can watch on a computer. My laptop screen is not large enough to enjoy the fullness of the dvd. So look out for this when ordering, i did not know this is what i was ordering :-("
4,Deja Vu!,The best thing and the most instructive information in this movie is that the people learned in their OWN way how to heal and decompresss AND that their moves are unbeknownst to them just like authentic moves in Africa which they have been denied. That's wonderful and sad.
2,Slow,"The dancing is outstanding, but the people behind the camera don't do it justice. It became too much of a soap opera and less about the dancing itself. These kids are magic, but the film as a whole was slow and eventually just got boring."
5,Invaluable Insight into the Origins of these Modern Dance Forms,"What better way to understand krumping and clowning, then to go to South Central LA, to Tommy the Clown's academy, where it all started? Great insight, great dancing. It was just great."
4,inspirational,a different way of approaching gangs in LA and how one person can impact on young people's lives in a very positive manner!!
3,Decent bowl but a bit too fragile considering it weighs a ton!,Exactly what the title says. I broke one as it slipped from my soapy hands on my graphite sink. I swear it was a 2 inch drop and it broke into 4 pieces. Perhaps it hit a weak spot but that was my first drop and I was quite shocked that it cracked.
3,Interested in the subject but not completely satisfied,Doesn't cover alot of his later life.Got a bit weary of his emphasis on his religious experiences and would have liked more about what he actually did. He sure was a different individual from the norm and I would not have fancied being his wife - she didn't seem to have any say as to whtat her beliefs and aspirations were .Interesting to learn something about such a significant world figure however.
4,Fascinating and insightful,"Gandhi's 'public' story is well known, filmed and written about. This book provides a depth of understanding of the man's view of life and how much effort he put into being the person that he wanted to be without consideration for the consequences which were of great historical importance and from which he was not aiming to be. His influence went global even though he was working 'locally'. A great inspiration."
5,Wonderful insight into a famous life,"I always knew about Mohandas Gandhi, but this book introduced me to the man and not just the legend. I found it fascinating to learn about why he rejected Christianity, and yet, many of his Hindu beliefs are parallel with the teachings of Jesus."
2,Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth,"The book was delivered on time and though it was a used item, it was in excellent condition. No complaints; very satisfied."
5,A lesson to learn,"A must read book. I finished this book in one sitting. It has more relevance in todays time when we see so much voilance around us. He lived his life for others like a saint, a big teaching."
5,A must read for anyone interested in Gandhi.,"A facinating self-portrait of possibly the greatest soul of this century. In a number of polls to name the ""Person of the Century"" taken by various media, Gandhi's name invariably shows up on the top. After reading this book, most will conclude the same. What impressed me the most about this book (not the person Gandhi)is the breadth of coverage in time, geography, politics, spirituality, economics, human psychology and many other things! After you have read this I suggest you read an outsider's view on Gandhi by Louis Fischer, ""Gandhi: His life and message for the world."""
2,Weird,"I actually put this book down because it was making me take an extreme dislike to Ghandi - which I didn't think was possible. It is extremely boring and tedious to read. Somehow you get the impression that Ghandi had a certain arrogance/holier than thou attitude about him. His attitude toward his wife is horrible, and even though he admits it was wrong, you feel he believes women are less than men. For all his achievements, he was a very strange person."
4,Gandhi's personal experiences - powerful lessons for all,"Gandhi remains one of the largest figures of the 20th century. His book describes his personal experience with honesty - one of the principles he had fought to uphold.Although some of his values may not be shared by others, one cannot but admire his unfailing commitment to the truth - and how this commitment provided him strength to shake of the bonds of colonialism and to bring India to freedom.There are lessons here - for those who wish to understand Gandhi. Even if one is not curious about Gandhi, his narrative provides a keen insight into the principle of truth and human nature.It is a great book, with important lessons for all of us."
2,Not what I expected,"I had high expectations of this book and I was disappointed. I believe Ghandi was one of the greatest, moral, and just citizens of the ages. But the book itself is fairly dull. I found the majority of it to be Ghandi obsessing on political beaurocracy, name dropping, and discussing his diet ad-infinitum. He comes across as quite a humourless man which makes the autobiography read like a dull textbook. I struggled to finish it. Its also disappointing because it was written before Ghandi achieved arguably his greatest achievements. I advise the reader with only a casual interest in Ghandi to pick up something else."
3,I don't know,"I was a huge fan of Ghandi. I had read every article written about him. I had bought the movie that was made about him and now when I bought his autobiography and read it. I am more then dissapointed!This great man didn't actually reveal his recipe clearly to future generations on how to be like him, peaceful and non-violent to insults and violence! Sadly I came across so many chapters when he wrote about Vegetarians clubs and books he read about diets.It is only my 'at the moment' opinion but Ghandi about Ghandi didn't actually wrote that wisely. His writings about himself are simple yet very confusing and even boring.Anyways, I had great difficulties finishing Ghandi's Autobiography and usually I finish a book within two-three days at most. But of course this doesn't mean that you'd find this book the same way I did. So instead of recommending this book to you I'd reccommend you to read a couple of pages in random before you purchase it."
2,Gandhi Revealed,"I read this book as part of a yoga book club. In his autobiography, Gandhi comes across as very unlikeable and tiresome. Furthermore, although Gandhi promotes non-violence outside the home, within his own home he is cruel and abusive particularly to his wife but also to his children--he did not practice what he preached. Many reviewers here mention his obsession with food and diet, which to me is indicative of eating disorders. Instead of interacting with people and truly caring about them, he constantly mentions the adulation he received. Ghandi clearly loved to be in control--he wanted to control his diet, he wanted to control people, and sex was abhorrent because he was not in control. My view of Gandhi was radically altered by reading this book."
5,"good item, fast shipping, will buy again without thinking again !","good item, fast shipping, will buy again without thinking again !"
4,Great Book - but not an autobiography,"This book is as Gandhi titled it - his experiments with truth. The publisher sells it as an autobiography. It's not. This book is a remarkable exploration of Gandhi's personal values as he tests them, learns from his errors and moves forward to try again. Gandhi's life is almost background scenery for his wonderful discussion of life, values and this man's seemingly boundless sense of human compassion."
5,Good book,I bought this book for a friend and he is really enjoying it. If your looking for a good read this is the one to read
3,Interesting,This is an interesting book. It is not a must have but a nice insight in Gandhi's life and experiences.
2,Horrendous Kindle edition,"Want to read this book, but the Kindle edition for sale here is plain awful and clearly was not edited or proofread. It is rife with misspellings, formatting errors, and random line breaks in the middle of sentences. Oh well -- I should have checked out the sample first, but for 0.99 cents it seemed like a no-brainer. I suppose if you really want a cheap version, it could suffice, but I will either be looking for a hard-copy or getting it somewhere else."
4,An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments With Truth,I haven't had the chance to read the book yet but I am sure it is a good book I am looking forward to reading it
4,Mercurial Mahatma,"It is indeed illuminating to read in Gandhi's own (translated) words the story of his life. Perhaps no person of modern times has been more mythologized by various hagiographic biographers and a host of cultic adorers. We don't begin to know Gandhi(ji) until we have read both a credible biography AND his autobiography, which reveals a truly quixotic and considerably delusional personality. As always with such stories, we are led to the question of the times making the man, or otherwise. (I myself dismiss the ""otherwise"".) This book is thought-provoking stuff."
5,An Autobuiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth,A very nice elucidation of the experiments with truth by this Mahatma !! I have always been a great admirer of Gandhiji .
5,We would wonder if such a man ever walked on earth: Einstein,This is second time I am reading the book. This is book about making of Gandhi. How an ordinary man become such a persona who mobilised the sub-continent with the simple and effective method of non voilance. Must to read!!
4,A must read for every Indian,"The book describes in detail about Gandhiji's life and is really enlightening. There are a lot of things one can learn from the way he lived, thought and preached.A couple of dislikes about the kindle version - it looks a bit unedited (there are some semantics errors) & also there is no cover page/contents page. I feel this is not the final version of his book."
1,Kindle Version Unreadable,"The amount of typos in this Kindle book are definitely an insult to the author. I found it very tough to take the text seriously as it was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors. I definitely have tolerated errors in other Kindle books, though not so many as this one, and with fiction that is much lighter in subject matter, this can be tolerable. However, I recommend in this case, to read Gandhi's story as it was meant to be read, which at this point will have to be in a hard copy."
4,A must read.,"This book is translated as if Gandhi had written it in English. If you want to learn more about Gandhi, or his ideas, this is the best source."
4,What are you looking for?,"Your reaction to this book will depend on what you're looking for. Like many of the previous comments stated, the book doesn't cover much of the part of Gandhi's later life. It's without a doubt a valuable insight into the mind of the man. It rambles at times and assumes knowledge of some events and people not so famous. If you are looking for a balanced examination of Gandhi's life, this book will not give you the distance from him to do that, but it will provide insights that other biographer's can't provide."
2,Slow Coming,I am still trying to get through this book. It is easy to read but hard in getting involved in it. His life was as boring as he said.
5,"Story of ""experiments"" & lessons","This book could also be called: ""What I learned in the first half of my life""Not only useful for knowing Gandhi's experiences & character, but will also offer valuable lessons, insight & wisdom."
5,Expand Your Mind,"I'm a newcomer to Solzhenitsyn's writings but after reading his One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, I was anxious for more. This Reader provides just the sampling I desired. It is not only valuable from the literary aspect but also from the historical. I gained insight regarding the Bolshevik Revolution, especially the dehumanizing effect of the Soviet regime under Lenin and Stalin. The effect on Solzhenitsyn of imprisonment in the labor camps is truly remarkable and spiritually edifying."
1,Excellent album but dodgy quality on vinyl,"This is one of my favourite albums of all time and has my favourite Big Star song, ""What's Going Ahn."" Unfortunately, I had to return two copies and after the third skipped I cut my losses and gave up. The first track ""O My Soul"" refused to play on several turntables of mine and friends. I also purchased #1 Record which plays fine but has more popping than one would expect from a brand new supposedly high end pressing.The vinyl version does sound much better than the CD double release that came out years ago, so if you can get a good copy, it's great."
2,disappointing,"I heard a cut over the radio, and thought it was worth looking into. Don't waste your money on this one. Very poppy, stupid lyrics, totally uninspiring. What happened to the artist who tried ""To Catch the Wind?""I guess he got old and boring. What a shame!"
4,Gypsy Muse,"This is some fine music from Donovan. I remember his early music with Gypsy Dave. This new album is no match, but it is a worthy contribution to the style and spiritual nature of blending style, spirit. and nature. If you have not heard it you can sample some songs. If you have not heard early Donovan, then you have no idea of what you missed."
4,Great CD. Lousy packaging.,"Whoever wrote that ""poor man's Bob Dylan"" line in the Amazon comments above just doesn't get it. Donovan is one of a kind. And this album show that he still has what it takes. It is prime Donovan all the way.Too bad that it comes in one of those crummy cardboard boxes. Is it too much to ask that great music have great packaging? Minus one star for the physical presentation."
4,Great Donovan Album,"This is a great Donovan album. After a few lsitens it will envelope you. This album is... smooth, cool and musically visual. Excellent production also. His voice is absolutely perfect and sounds exactly like it did in 1966. This songs are very well writen and simple. It's like taking a time machine at some points. Seems like he's realized that he can sound like he did in the 60's and still be who he is today. A hard thing to do with any artist but he really pulls it off here. Will we be listening to this in in 2034? I'm sure I will be. Lay your head back and let the master of cosmic music take you ""there"". You will not regret it. An album that will be with you through the years."
4,Surprisingly Fresh,I couldn't help but stereotype what I expected from Donovan having listened to his music for about 40 years. I stand corrected. The songs and arrangements on this cd are timeless. Its a fusion of acoustic jazz with mystic poetry and crystalline voice that echos throughout the ages. Its cool.
4,A terrfic heroine,"I loved this story as a little girl, and recently bought a copy to read to my daughter. I love the heroine, she is strong but compassionate, and it is this combination that wins the respect of her would-be robbers.Though one little historical inaccuracy always makes me laugh, it's so minor, it really doesn't matter: the writer has the European characters eating ""potato soup"" in 1100, when potatoes, a new-world food, didn't arrive in Europe till over 500 years later!"
5,Rockin' Heaven Down,"Bebe Le Strange is one of Heart's strongest albums. While only garnering Gold status, it nevertheless is a true Rock album success with very solid and entertaining material. The album is now offered as a remastered disc with two added gems ""Jackleg Man"" and a live version of ""Break"", which I highly recommend. Nancy really shines on this record with her instrumental ""Silver Wheels"", and ""Raised On You"", while Ann gets down and dirty with ""Rockin' Heaven Down"", ""Break"" ""Strange Night"", ""Bebe"", and ""Down On Me"". ""Even It Up"", the album's single is not one of my favorites, but is also a true rocker. ""Sweet Darlin'"" and ""Pilot"" are beautiful ballads that are performed as only Heart can, and will fill you with sheer unadulterated bliss. This album is a must have for any Heart fan."
5,Heart in full control of itself,"Some people have written that this album is more consistent in terms of quality, that the previous albums were full of a lot of filler. Not so. The previous albums had no filler. A listener might have cared for some tracks less than others, but each of the tracks on previous albums had its own beauty and depth. Anyway, Bebe Le Strange is a more direct, less mysterious album than Heart's previous four, but no less powerful for that."
3,basting fool,can not wait to try this basting mop next time I smoke will love it better than spooning the liquid on meat
4,A useful guide.,"If you can't get up to the ""Dacks"" or Vermont to go backcountry skiing, you might be intrested in this book. It is a short guide that points you in the direction of the skiable trails of the Catskill mountains.I first saw this book at a BB we were staying in in Fleishmans and later found the book for sale at a store in the Catskill corners complex. Over the last 15 years I have been keeping notes in my trail guide of the Catskills with possible ski runs. This book has confirmend some and led me to others.Not enough emphasis on down mountain skiing to suite me but still a useful guide."
3,"Not as good as part 1, but still worth watching","After being transported back in time 500 years Stephen Chow is given a certain mark on his foot by an Immortal woman. She is a very nice lady, but her sister also lives in her body. So while she is nice in the daytime, her evil sister is the one who lives in her body at night. Stephen Chow falls in love with her. Honestly I couldn't follow the story very well. The Longevity Monk is trying to get Chow to become the Monkey King but Chow has to decide which of 2 women he loves first.Luckily there is plenty of comedy and some good action too. After struggling to follow the convoluted plot all the way through parts 1 and 2, I was glad that I stuck around for the end. I probably would have liked the movie more if Chow spent more time dressed as the Monkey King.3/5"
4,Great material - text is tiny,"I bought the paperback version and found the text to be difficult to read. I then bought a used hardcover (from an Amazon seller, of course) - it was MUCH more legible, and it had pics that the paperback didn't have. I'd suggest the hardcover if you're over 50."
4,Feeling lucky with this one,The book is generally in good condition & would have been great if it had a dust cover. At a brief glance Doolittle had a full life with much adventure and fame. Should be a great read.
4,"Great aviator, so-so author","Jimmy Doolittle contributed mightily to aviation, and this book (his autobiography) chronicles his life, from before he became a pilot through all of his military careers and into his post military civilian life. No doubt, he was one of the greatest aviators ever. His writing style is easy to read, but not very exciting. One has to read between the lines to see how exciting his life must have been. But I certainly recommend his book to anyone interested in aviation."
4,Great American,"Outstanding work from a great American. I'm almost finished with the book on my Kindle. He filled in a lot of my Doolittle knowledge gaps. Wish he would have more time discussing what happened after crashing in China and being rescued. Read Ted Lawson's book ""30 seconds over Tokyo"" several years ago and thought Doolittle's book would spend more time on the raid."
5,Great quality,"Bought Sennheiser RS130 and a Ad-on; both arrived same day. HAve been using them for over 3 weeks; both work great; bought them to have more than one person enjoy home theater and not disturb others in the house. Headphones work as expected. Far superior to others I have had.2 minor issues which do not bother me or my family; with no audio present, you get a very low level hiss; when walking through the house and pass through doorways into other areas, an occasional and very slight skip in the sound track occurs, immediately back to normal."
4,Great headset,"I purchase these about 6 months ago. I am hard of hearing and I was looking for a headset that would let me watch TV and not bother others with a higher than normal volume. I agree with other reviewers, I find that I wear them all the time when I watch TV. My wife was taken back by the price I paid but after 2 days she thought it was a great buy. She now finds she has to ask me to turn up the TV when she wants to watch. Pro - 1) I can go to other parts of the house and not miss the TV show; 2) My wife can play her piano without bothering me when I watch the TV. Con - It says that it will broadcast 100 meters, 100 feet is more accurate. I can get good reception anywhere within the house but it is limited to about 75 feet when I go outside."
2,Worked well for 2 weeks and it broke,I set up the headphones and they worked well with our TV for two weeks and then one night while using them the transmitter just stopped working-no power. I have to send them to Sennheiser for repair. What a hassle.
4,Love the Sound,"My husband is hard of hearing,so we purchased the Sennheiser system for him. I also purchased the add on pair of headphones for myself. We now can listen to the same program without my husband trying to read subtitles. He enjoys watching movies now,and even an occasional concert.We're so happy now. Thank you."
5,Works Great,"Looked at the alternatives and bought this one. Works great with the TV, but be sure to plug it into the correct output jack. I get some feedback once in a while, but slightly moving the headphones stops that immediately."
5,loud tv no more,I bought this for my husband many years ago because he kept turning the t.v. up louder and louder to hear it over the children. He zones out with the headphones on and now everybody is happy. This pair is actually a replacement pair because the original pair is worn out. I bought the original pair many years ago. Awesome product.
2,Poor Reception Range,"I admit I am a little puzzled by the favorable reviews. I have two sets of these. They are acceptable headphones, but they have no range whatsoever. You literally cannot leave the room the transmitter is in or it will cut out (yes, yes, I know the source volume must be high, etc., etc. - tried it and 1/2 dozen other suggestions and it does not solve the problem). I live in an ordinary neighborhood of single family homes. The interference is especially bad if you are moving around - you better sit still even in that one room you are limited to. I find it hard to believe that such a flawed device could even pass the company's testing and design. How is it that our 900Mhz wireless phones work fine in our home, and this does not? On the plus side, they are very comfortable and the sound is good. Will never buy Sennheiser wireless headphones again unless they come up with a new technology, perhaps something like DECT 6.0 phones."
3,biased?,"3 stars for Mel. Two knocked off-- one for Diane's obvious biasness and one for the network's biasness. Diane was 'just' doing what she was told to do and was scripted to do (doh?). There's a movie out in theaters now called ""Saved"". It is very biased towards young Christians. How much you want to bet that this movie will NOT be put down by Diane or this network? Any takers?Mel impresses me with his boldness in doing the movie and the interview. He KNEW what the reaction would be by the ""hey we insist on Christians being tolerant"" club. The networks have long been biased towards anything Christian (nothing new there and God help these people!), but Mel stood by his beliefs and has an answer in season and out. Good going Mel!"
5,Can Non-Believers Understand What Believers Believe,"This interview talks to heart of the believer in Christ. Secular or non-believing journalists see Christians as ""weirdos"" sometimes. Notice I didn't say ""all the time"".It is had for people, who believe that the only way to heaven is through Jesus, to make people who have rejected (or never searched for) that truth understand our passion, our committment, our love for Jesus and His Father.I suggest purchasing this video and showing it to your children, as a way to make them understand the difference between the two molds of TRUTH. The main goal of the Christian faith is not to drag others to Christ, but show them the light - that they may see for themselves the love, grace, and hope the Savior brings to all.I think Mel Gibson is bringing people to the light. Hopefully Diane Sawyer is a light-seeker. :-)www.therunninggirl.com"
4,very readable,"It was interesting to follow a case study through all the chapters of the book. It provided a continuity that helped the reader identify with the family and concepts being presented. The author's voice is easy to understand and explains everything as he goes along, which is also another reason this book is a quick read. My favorite textbook for the class I'm taking!"
1,The Worst Album Ever?,This just might be the worst album that I have ever heard. It tinkers with nothing except a continuation of the pop metal from the 1980's. Unfortunately it does not work. I only paid $0.50 in a bookstore for it and it is worth that much for nostalgic sake. Anything more than a dollar is probably a little too much.
1,Died out a long ago. Never to be seen again,"One of the worst sounding bands i ever heard. Only bought it since it was $.97 brand new. totally not worth the money. Cheese metal died, and this band died with it, somewhat. Where are they now?"
5,"Excellent, personal attention!","When Amazon couldn't assure me I'd get the book by Christmas, Sheila actually called me to assure me I would. That's service beyond anything imaginable in this day of impersonal customer service. Excellent!"
5,Auntie Maim,"I discovered this book thanks to a friend back in the dim, dead 80's (thanks ever so, Blanche!) and have jealously guarded the copy of it I found in a used bookstore in Milwaukee's General Mitchell airport shortly after. Now that it is back in print, I can finally give this book out.Utterly hilarious, without being overtly vulgar (unlike the recent ""My Lush Life""), this is a perfect parody of the lady-like memoirs of most of the stars of Hollywood's Golden Age. The amoral, boozy, trampy Belle Poitrine presents her life story of booze, trampiness, and general pervi-ness in such laughably lady-like prose that you will literally be shaking with mirth. A true must have."
5,"""BOOSTEN-HALTERS"" ['an then sum].","I shouldda sued Mr. Dennis way back - about three - four decades ago - a suffy public library - I'm this spotty kid thumbling through this seemingly 'innocent' tome - then giggle, rumble, gales of laughter later I'm vaguely but sternly banished from the public reading room - fortunately with this little tome firmly ensconced in my clutches.What a treat for the blues - and those photographs![Movie version please - not the musical though .....]Another great gem and a MUST HAVE - especially during the ""Joyous Season'Can be quite 'lethal' if you're not prepared - but don't read this one in a Public library - quite a hazard!"
5,The funniest biography you'll ever read,"""Little Me"" is the hilarious autobiography of self proclaimed legendary screen goddess Belle Poitrin. I laughed until I cried during part of this romp. Some of the best parts include Belle's production of Hawthorn's the Scarlet Letter (in case you were wondering where Demi Moore got the idea)and Belle's descent into young boys and Imperial whiskey.If you like satire you'll love ""Little Me""Dennis has wriiten the ultimate Hollywood trash biography."
4,Clever writing and great pictures!,"It took me a little while to get into this book, but around the middle, I found myself smiling every time I picked it up. The pretension and self-delusion of Belle is priceless. The pictures are so funny--you can see how much the models enjoyed their roles."
3,1/2 and 1/2,"This is one of those novels I call a half and half.. I enjoyed half it tremendously, but I found the other half incredibly boring. The parts I enjoyed consisted of Hatshepsut going to war and showing the men what she was made of, the rare but special moments with her architect lover, the way she put people in their place, especially her husband, and just the persistency this woman showed in holding on to her crown, even tho she was a ""mere woman."" The parts I did not enjoy were mainly ""Amun this, Amun that,"" and the overly descriptive details about rocks and water and such, and the extreme bursts of incredible arrogance from the heroine. I found those parts too abundant and they made half the book dull for me. I did, however, enjoy the story of Hatshepsut."
4,Great Historical Fiction,"The life of Hapshepsut has never been written so well (in fiction). Being an Egyptologist, I found this book to have very few errors that would interfere with reading. Anyone bitten by Egyptomania will love this book"
2,Child of The Morning,"I'm sure it is a good book. After reading all of the current Michelle Moran's books, I found this very hard to get into. I never finished it and waiting for the new Michelle Moran book to come out."
5,"If you don't buy this book, you're missing a great read!","I bought this book when it was published in June 1978! I have read it again and again over the years and recently purchased this new one and have retired my original to a special spot on my bookshelf. If I were stranded on a desert island and given only one book to read, this would be it!"
5,Great Book,"Although this book is nearly ten years old, it could have been written yesterday. Ms. Gedge's prose is fresh, her stories are timeless, and for anyone looking to ""get into"" Egyptian fiction, I would highly recommend this. Her entire series on ancient Egypt is wonderful, and this book in particular takes you away from the modern world to the look and feel of ancient Egypt. I particularly liked her descriptions of the landscape. I felt like I could breath in the waters of the Nile, and could feel the hot grains of sand beneath my feet.5 Stars!"
3,Horrible editing!,"This book was great, but the editing was atrocious. It's like nobody even proofread the kindle version, and it didnt translate well. Other than than, awesome book."
4,Works well for me,Works well for me in my Gracie Jiu-Jitsu class. Pretty comfortable. You have to adjust it so it sits on the crown of your head. If it's not working for you(sliding down) then I suspect you don't have it adjusted to sit on top your crown. Go higher and a little tighter.
3,Somewhat Satisfied,"Product quality good. Just didn't like the way the individual weights banged together. If they were secure I would have kept the weight set. Ended up sending them back. If the weights banging together doesn't bother you, this is a good set."
4,Product & Service as advertised,Product and service as advertised although there was some confusion about shipping and tracking. Good Job though.
1,"CHEAPER,BY FAR, AT TARGET.",this is my first disappointment with amazon.it now will force me to check prices before i order anything again from amazon.this item is $20.00 cheaper at target and is not even on sale. beware- amazon apparently does not check prices from other places.
1,"NOT RECOMMENDED,TO CHEAP AND BAD QUALITY","Mine broke after just 2 months of use,exactly today and I am very careful with my stuff usually; a small piece from one of the weight actually fell after a few seconds after I open the package ,I ignore it,I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it but ... still. I would have paid a little more for a better quality product but because I'm an Amazon customer for years I trust them; next time I'll be more careful.Don't recommend this product,seriously!"

5,The essential work in this field.,"Computational Transport Phenomena has been the single best general work I have found in my research into numerical heat and mass transfer problems. Clearly written, with excellent examples. Also includes well composed FORTRAN code samples."
5,The best book I've ever read,"Just in general, i think this book is just soooo coool. I especially enjoyed the fourth order classical runge-kutta method. Professor Schiesser and Cesar knows what they are talking about, NO?"
3,A Relatively Weak Effort from a Strong Performer,"While this is the latest effort from Melissa Etheridge, it is unquestionably her weakest effort. Unfortunately, making records is a commercial business and MLE succumbed to the pressure to follow up her wildly successful ""Yes I Am"" CD while she was still ""hot."" This effort was wasted and the CD seems to be a half-hearted effort. All of her fans anxiously await her new CD due to be released in early 1999, since she's had a long time off from touring and recording due to the birth of her daughter."
1,OHH MY GOD!!!,This album was horrible! My son and I are big fans of Melissa and this alubm was trash! I can;t believe that after Yes I am which was pure gold she had to have trash like this! Skip this album now!
4,Melissa sure can ROCK!,"This is one terrific rock album. She has a very strong voice, which is equally capable of singing a soft ballad as she is at roaring out her trademark in-your-face hard rock. This is the only Etheridge cd I have so far, but for sure, it won't be the last. If you like your rock hard, in the tradition of Bon Jovi or Springsteen (before he mellowed) then you will love Melissa. As I haven't listened to her other albums I can't compare this to them, but I'm sure it's at least every bit as good."
2,seems to have lost her passion,"The reason I fell in love with M Ethridge way back in 89 was because of the hooks in her music and, more importantly, because of the passion she sang her songs with. From the first listen I heard no fire from Melissa this time. When compared to ""Somebody Bring Me Some Water"" and ""Brave and Crazy,"" the songs on this cd doesn't even come close to the feeling. I hope her next cd brings some of the fire back."
5,Little Secrets,"What is the best little secret about this album? Contrary to what lots of people say, its an excellent album! Melissa sure proves that she can rock on this one. Take the first single, the title track Your Little Secret. Arguablly one of her best shining moments, definately a stand out here on this album. Or how about I Want To Come Over, a lover's plea. In a way it was little the sequel to Come To My Window. An Unusual Kiss, I Really Like You and I Could Have Been You also rock this cd. Then there are the excellent, poignant tracks such as the most underrated This War Is Over, and Change and Nowhere To Go. This is an excellent album, just give it a listen and you'll see why. This cd sure does rock! And so does Melissa!"
4,Beware of the MIDI cable,"First beware of the MIDI cable that is supplied with the software. If it is the M-Audio Uno USB-MIDI cable (which is what I have), it might not work with your keyboard. This MIDI cable is not 100% compatible with all keyboards, especially with the Yamaha keyboards. I got an Yamaha keyboard and it took me 3 days to figure out what is the problem. And I ended up buying a separate USB-MIDI cable, Yamaha UX16, which cost me another $50 bucks.However, once I got this to work correctly, my kid loves to play with it. That's good. The only problem is the program is meant to be a game, and not a piano lecture. It does not teach proper fingering, techniques and etc... So, don't think you can use this to learn piano. However, it does make playing piano a lot more fun, especially if your kids or yourself like to play video games.Overall, this program is a good fun musical game. The price is a bit steep."
2,Not what I expected,"When I ordered this I thought I was getting a DVD of The Chocolate Soldier with Nelson Eddy. I had entered Nelson Eddy in the search so I expected to get his movies, so I was disappointed to get a TV version with Eddie Albert."
2,Caveat Emptor,"This is simply not up to par. Yes, Kenneth More is a fine actor, but nearly everything else is inferior to awful. Take the second program on disc one, ""The Oracle of the Dog."" The acting is on the high school level, the camera work is painfully awkward, the script is filled with cliches, and the ending is embarrassingly predictable. This is a collection of some of the worst British television programs I've ever seen--and I'm familiar with a great many. Alas, Chesterton had so much to say."
4,Father Brown video,"These films are faithful to the Father Brown books. If murder mysteries can be gentle and humorous, Father Brown's are, and so are these movies."
3,Interesting but not a real winner!,"I love British mysteries, but Father Brown seems a little flat. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Father Brown - Set 1,"Fairly good stories - Kenneth More portrays Father Brown very well; however, some of the stories seem trite. Closed captioning would be good."
1,Deeply disappointed in this show,"It was awful- really hard to watch - I knew the endings before the first ten minutes were up. Father Brown is boring - the stories are told in such a way that the spoon feed you the ending and make sure you get all of the ""hints"" right away. Awful - just awful."
2,Disappointing British Series,"I am a big fan of British mysteries and had reasonably high hopes for this series from the reviews. Alas, I found them much less than I had hoped for. The stories and the acting, with the possible exception of Kenneth More, seemed sophomoric and overdone. The secondary actors (several of whom I am familiar with from other films) were way over the top, shouting and declaiming far more than the part called for amd much more than I have seen them do elsewhere. While some of the stories were pretty good and some were really pretty bad, the acting almost without exception made me feel as though I were watching an amateur play.The episodes all had a very stage-y feeling that became very wearing after a while. All in all, this series was a severe disappointment."
4,Fast and funny read,"Most of Eric Frank Russel's books have one thing in common, the quick witted humans outsmarting the dim-witted aliens. And this is no exception to the rule. While this may seem rather predictable and boring he always manages to avoid duplication. Each time the basic plot is worked out in a new and refreshing way.Do not read this book if you want to read serious science giction or military science fiction. That is not what this book is about. It was written to tell a story that should not be taken seriuos and that leaves a smile on your face. And this is exactly what it does, and brilliantly so.This time the aliens being outwitted are on the other side of an intergalactic war, and they have made the unfortunate mistake of capturing and imprisoning an earthling. But that was not their biggest mistake, the biggest mistake was teaching him their language. For once they learn to communicate their war is as good as lost."
5,Alternative title: Space Willies,"A fun read; most of the books I have read by this author have protagonists that mess with the minds of bureaucracies; either human or alien.This book was also published as half of an ace double with the title of ""Space Willies"" (see [...)."
2,Too strong!,"I am in my late 30's, weigh only 100 lbs. I bought this drink at a local Seven Eleven, and drank quarter a bottle on my way home on foot. I felt somehow lightheaded while I was walking home. Then, about 10 minutes later, after getting home, I had another quarter. My heart started racing, and suddenly I had a bowel movement. When I came out of the bathroom, I felt a little better. Then, I took plenty of water to flush it down. In total, I just had half a bottle, but it still was too strong for me. I was lucky that I read the direction before opening the bottle, but the direction on the bottle was not clear and I am afraid that it is unreadable for some people."
1,this product is not for sensitive people: it made me very very sick,"I bought one of these to try after reading something online about how it works great and has no crash. Cautiously, I drank a small sip from a bottle. Probably less than a 16th of the two serving bottle. Very soon I was tweaking quite extremely and my friend noticed how irritable I had become from the drink. However, it did seem to wear off a few hours later without a crash. I gave it a tentative try the next day, only drinking a tiny sip twice during the day. Similar effect, so far so good. The third day I tried a tiny sip in the morning and developed an excruciating headache and nausea that has lasted for two days now. I feel extremely overwired and unable to come down from it. Very very sick. I feel horrible still two days later and I hope I improve soon."
4,drink the whole thing,"I drink one of these before I work-out. A half a bottle wouldn't do a thing for me. People who have a problem with this, I just don't get. Chow."
1,Do not buy,"I use a lot of energy drinks (Jack3d, redbull, assault..etc). This is the worst energy drink you can have. It is just awful. First the crashing afterwards is maximized. i had to sleep for 2 days straight after this. No other energy drinks do that. Redbull and jack3d and Monster are all great. Worst part is, I did not even get that much kick out of it. It is the worst drink you can buy."
3,Be careful....it's powerful,"If I was rating it on a power scale it would be five stars. The problem is that coming from one who is mildly a ""energy drinkaholic,"" this stuff kind of scared me after taking it for awhile on a regular basis. Drinking it now and then probably wouldn't be a big deal but after about a week of having one daily, I began to get chest pains and so I stopped. If you're careful with it I'm sure it would be just fine for some."
4,Jump start your day,Redline helps me get more from my workout. I drink 1/3 of a bottle before I get on the treadmill and it helps me last longer. It also gives me a nice jump start to my day. NEVER drink the whole bottle at once.
3,Product review.,"This is relatively good material, as all other Krav Maga videos which give you some foundation on defense. However, I was disappointed that Nardia was not really providing the verbal or physical demonstration."
5,This Is The Real Deal!,"This is one of the best disarm handgun defense besides ""Gun Disarming Tactics"" I find to be the real deal in true disarming defense. I recommend it!"
5,Kapap Gun Disarming,I would like to recommend this good DVD toanyone who want to learn about real self defense.This DVD is about the Gun Disarming principlesand concepts of the Kapap system.Am Israel Chai
2,"Crude, Barely Functional as a Transit, Cheaply Made","I purchased this item as a ""poor man's transit"" to rough out a building site. The price seemed reasonable in comparison to the ""real"" instruments. The product is crude and economically manufactured in China (what isn't these days?). It's functional, but by no means a precision instrument and the instructions and user manual are crudely translated on a flimsy little rice-paper pamphlet. It's not what I had envisioned and barely usable for my intended purpose."
5,Brújula CST-Berger 17-651,"La Brújula llego en condiciones perfectas, de gran utilidad. Perfecta en la medición de rumbos y buzamientos de estratos en geología, muy parecida a la Brunton, el estuche protector es resistente. La Brújula es Azimutal (Graduada de 0-360). Bastante Precisa sin nada que envidiar a otras, el precio es bastante económico en comparación con otras parecidas."
2,Hard to be precise,"The thing is just too hard to read, it seams accurate but judging exactly where the indicator is without a numbers scale is too hard. I stopped using it."
1,Doesn't work.,I received this in the mail and it doesn't work. I've had similar ones before that worked fine but for whatever reason this one is completely useless. Now I'm going to buy a digital one!
3,"A good story, poorly edited and sloppily produced","The tragedy of this book is that the story is compelling, filled with lots of grit and yet Laura Morton has screwed it up. Take note that nearly every paragraph ends with a predictable short sentence. While struggling to follow the life story of Melissa Ehteridge, the reader is forced to confront repetitive paragraphs, and even errors. For example, some of the photos are mislabeled and misdated. Further, there are incidences where a paragraph will state something which is immediately contradicted by a statement in the next paragraph.All of this is truly a shame. Melissa's story has elements that all of us can identify with. She is emotional, creative and reflective. A better editor and co-author could have produced an absolutely stunning book with the raw material provided by Melissa. It almost seems like somebody forgot to proof-read the book and rushed it to publication."
4,Honesty,"While this book is not particularly complex reading. It is honest. Melissa is upfront in stating that this is her perspective of the events. I believe we all experience life through our own filters whether we own that or not is a different question. I would encourage someone to read the book not only as an interest in this musican but as a perspective on choices we make, struggles we face and cultural bias we each deal with in our own way. This is how Melissa confronted her choices and describes her decision making. The book communicates Melissa as very human- making tough choices and growing up along the way. Here are the bumps and bruises we all can related to."
3,"Slightly Interesting, Not Deeply Revealing","Ms. Etheridge is a songwriter and a rock star -- not a Pulitzer winning author. That's OK with me. I was expecting deeper revelations and more ""dish"" on her earlier days. On the other hand, how much is enough. It makes sense that much of the book is dedicated to her long-term relationship with Julie Cypher. The breakup is what was going on when the book was being written. If she'd glossed over it, she would have been criticized for it. The depth of Melissa's pain from Julie's betrayal is obvious; who among us would not smarting?The review from ""A Reader in the US"" takes great pleasure in slamming Melissa for airing her dirty laundry over the breakup and states he/she won't listen to Melissa's music because of the book. Whatever. Don't let these comments sway you. If you're a fan of Melissa's and want to hear her side of the story, buy the book."
5,You MUST read this book!,"If you are an ME fan, you MUST read this book. It is written from her soul. It is her truth. It is a very real, from the gut, honest story. She doesn't hold back. I laughed and cried right along with her. She actually made me ""feel"" what she is feeling."
3,Way too much information...,"I have to agree with Howdydudes (below)-- Although I love Melissa Etheridge's music, I don't really need to know all of the personal details of her relationships. The parts of the book that I enjoyed the most were those that explained how she wrote her songs and what they meant, but that could have been done without giving every intimate detail of her therapy sessions. Yes, her personal experiences obviously shaped and inspired her music, but the way that it was presented in the book almost seemed like a ploy to get back at (or back with) Julie. If I were Julie I'd feel so betrayed that the intimate details of my life were put out there like that....."
4,Honest and Very Interesting!,"I just finished this book and was sad to see it end. I loved it! It was brutally honest, and very heart warming at the same time. I feel like I have a slightly better understanding of Melissa and her music. I've been a huge fan for a long time! Book was well written and very easy to read. I liked that she included some of her song lyrics in there and talked about how they came into being. I would recommend this for any Melissa fan out there. It'll just make you appreciate her that much more! Order it now!"
2,Clarity comes with time,"Melissa can capture an audience through her music because her songs seem to come directly from the pain or pleasure of her experience. Though that may be personal to her, it can be shared by many because most of us go through it at some time or another. Writing an autobiography is not the same. First, she's only 40. I'm hoping she has much more public career left in her. Besides that, I don't think she had enough distance from her relationship with Julie to have good judgement about what to put on the page. What may have felt like the truth for her when she was writing this a year ago may seem like a backlash attack by now. Her contributor must have been too 'in awe' or just collecting the paycheck to help Melissa really think through what she wants to last through time in print. Privacy is something to be respected for many reasons. Next time, Melissa, write with someone who cares about you."
5,great book,Fans of Melissa Etheridge unite and read this book I LOVED IT Read it in one sitting very revealing and LOVE SKIN the perfect CD to listen to while reading!
5,"Powerful, humbling, and honest","This is an incredibly powerful book. So much of it is from a dark,painful place, but Melissa just won't stay there. Her zest for life shines through and sets an example for all of us. What a journey this woman is on."
2,Boring,"After reading the other two bio's on melissa, I couldn't wait for her to write her own. I was very disappointed. When mentioning her band she completely leaves out Dave Beyer. Talk about a slap in a the face for him. I thought she would have a least put in more stories of being on the road instead of rehashing old interviews. Bascially I'm sorry I wasted my money. Don't get me wrong I'm a major Melissa fan. I just thought the book [stunk]."
5,Loving the honesty,Wow was this book a great read. I loved every second of it and read it in less than a day. She tells it how it is and lets us get the inside view on her life. Melissa is an amazing women and it is incredible to understand why she wrote the lyrics she did at certain times in her life. A must read!
3,Not Sure What To Think,"I start out by saying that I have been a Melissa Etheridge fan for some time. This book, while informative as to where the songs come from, leaves me at a loss for something. Her music and lyrics are powerful and you see where that power eminates from. But the book also seemed vindictive, not just to former lovers, but everyone in her life. I also thought the book was sketchy at times, vague in areas where establishing a background would have helped better understand her personal feelings towards those around her. I also struggle with the fact that she decided to have children while her relationship, never minding whether hetero or homosexual, was on very rocky ground. But hey, that seems to be todays world. Definately a read for a fan, but maybe the book could have used more truth and reflection and less tabloid reporting of promiscuity."
4,"Good, but right?","This is a good book, filled with pain, humor and a lot of courage. It does however contain a lot of personal ""dish"", which honestly compelled me to read it. But does that make it ok to write such personal information about another person (her former spouse as well as other friends). I wonder if she will regret having written this in 5-10 years and even what her kids would think. Given all that, I still recommend reading it--a real life beach book..."
3,OK,"This book clearly had another writer besides Melissa, and that takes a lot of the color out of the narratives. But it answered a lot of questions for me and gave me a context for the songs. It's a read once, and give it away book."
4,The Truth Is . . . Melissa's Book Is Good,"I'm a die-hard Melissa fan. I have every one of her albums and have lost count of the number of her concerts I've been to. That being said, I thought Melissa's book was very interesting. Although it's not a ""here's every detail of my life"" kind of autobiography, it provides some real insight into her music and life. The book is really easy to read (I finished it in one sitting of a couple hours) and tells a good story. Bottom line: for anyone who is a Melissa fan, this book is sure to please."
4,Too Much Information,"I think I friend summed it up best when she said ""I hate to ruin a perfectly good obsession by actually getting to know someone."" This was a very personal book and I regret having read it if only for the fact it it was all too real and too human. Kind of like reading your friend's life story. But hey, I'm no critic and I would still recommend the book, it's a quick read and has some interesting pictures."
5,A must read for every Melissa Etheridge Fan,"Her truth is fascinating. If you are a fan, you'll enjoy learning about the life of Melissa Etheridge. From her childhood memories and her dream to be a Rock n' Roll star to her life at forty and the reality of being a Rock n' Roll star, her story is captivating. (I could only disagree with ""her truth"" on one issue. She does not believe COME TO MY WINDOW is a love song and I believe it is. COME TO MY WINDOW was her ""I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this relationship work"" song. If that's not love, I don't know what is.) The insight she provided on her inspiration to pen the lyrics to some of her songs was intriguing. I must admit that when I finished reading this book, I still wanted to know more. However, as a Melissa Etheridge fan, I must say THANK YOU! for sharing a part of your world with us! Come to my window - I'll open the door!"
2,another behind the music episode,"I am not a die hard melissa etheridge fan, but 95% of the material I read in the book -- I already knew from ""vh1 behind the music"" or in other melissa etheridge interviews. I found the book to be melissa's platform for sympathy rather than an account of the singer's life."
2,Broken,"We wanted a watering jug toy b/c our son is always trying to play with ours when we tend to our plants. However, when we got this in the mail, the nozzle/sprout was already broken off. Contemplating on buying a different brand."
5,Sometimes a bad hair day can last more than a century.,"That's what Jackie Clarke finds out in Deb Stover's latest time travel. Finding herself stranded in the Rockies in the midst of a June snow storm (yep, we do get those sometimes!), Jackie's nightmare goes from bad to worse when a fire and a painting somehow transport her to 1891.Her unfortuate choice of hair color leads to a case mistaken identity, and even Jackie's inability to carry a tune in a miner's lunch pail can't persuade the locals that she not the famous dancehall singer Lolita. Fortunately, a timely kidnapping and quick thinking keep her off the stage for a few weeks, and in home of Cole Morrison, a Mel Gibson lookalike.Throw in a handsome villain and the real Lolita, and you have one of Deb Stover's funniest, sexiest books, yet. If you are looking for a book to cool you down on these hot summer nights -sorry, this ain't it! You definitely want to crank up the air conditioning for this one."
4,Ok,"Most was good, but parts seemed overly sappy. Overall, not too bad for a freebie. Worth the read for a good love story."
3,Review,A good historical romance. Easy to read and a good sense of comedy mixed in with light romantic scenes that keep u turning the page.
4,It was good..,"I've read almost all of Ms. Stover books and this one was good but not as good as the Mulligan Stew ones. I liked Cole and Jackie and Todd was a cute second character. I really like Chief Byron as he was rather mysterious. Over all, I would definitly recommend this book. I'm now off to read Another Dawn, which I know I'll like. After all, it is by Deb Stover so how can I go wrong?"
3,book,It was a pretty good book but there was a lot of repetition of some of the characters lines that were a little annoying but for the most part it was a good story
4,Nice story,"Liked it, kept my interest, believable setting, really liked that it was free. Will look for this author on other books."
1,A Moment In Time,Ok book it was too long in parts too sexy .would not recommend it to friends. needed more story line .
5,one of the best authors out there!!,"Deb Stover is by fat one of three most compelling writers and had the most amazing characters. As an actor, I love her characters the most as they'd be so fun to play!! Her books are exciting and magical and you won't be able to put it down. VERY well written. You won't regret it."
2,The grammar was good.,"From 49% to 66% on my kindle there was nothing but hard-ons and lusting. I was scanning fairly quickly hoping to have some story line, but couldn't get past the ice cold water falls and the lusting Lolita/Jackie. What happens to the oregon trip? Was the mine truly lacking in gold? what happens to the 2 saloon owners both trying to get Lolita to work for them? What happens to Cole, does he get charged with kidnapping? Is Blade,the guy that abandoned Jackie in a cabin in the middle of nowhere in present day, also the look alike in the 18th century? Does Jackie return to her own time or stay with Cole.I will never know, I am deleting this book from my Kindle.I gave it 2 stars for lack of grammatical errors, at least for the portion I read."
4,A Moment In Time,It turned out different than I expected. Could be the start of a series if the author wants to continue with this couple.
4,Good Video!,"This cardio pilates video is really good. Unfortunatley it is only slightly different from the pilates mat workouts with Ana Caban. I usually do both in a row to get an extra workout. So, although it is not that difficult I recommend it for the flexibility you will gain."
2,Pilates part great! Cardio not so much.,"I enjoyed this DVD up until the cardio portion, which is the last 10 mintures or so.The cardio portion is seriously 4 steps repeated over and over again - didn't do a thing for me and was very boring.So I would get this DVD just for the first 30 minutes - a nice all over body pilates work out."
3,Cardio not up to expectations,"The dvd is split into two sections. The first part is pilates based (25-30), while the second part (10 minutes)is cardio based. The cardio was not very effective. The same move(walking in place) was used in variation. I did not think the cardio was effective, however the pilates part was similar to a beginner workout."
3,The first half is good,I think this video can be shortened to half of its length. The first part of pilate is reasonable. The 2nd half of cardio workout is just too repetitive and boring.
2,Cardio portion is AWEFUL!,"The pilates portion is pretty good - keeps your heart rate up, continuous movement. The rocking moves are a little odd, but that's just me I guess. The cardio portion is terrible. No imagination, repetitive and very dull."
2,Not good,"Concept is great but unless you are totally out of shape, this workout is pointless. I give it 2 stars because I think it could be a good workout for someone who is just beginning an exercise routine. Pilates portion is decent but short and the cardio tests your sanity, not your body, it is so boring. Not worth the purchase at all, I never use this one."
2,not a cardio workout!!,"THis video is a waste of money, the cardio session is extremely lame, invest in a good pilates video if you are looking for a workout!"
1,i never recieved this product...,"i never recieved this product. i am very pleased that amazon was able to refund my money. i hope this will never happen again, and this seller should not be able to sell on amazon."
5,great low intesity for beginners!!,"I am someone who has to quite high intensity cardio workouts all the time because they are too intense for me. I am young, and though I am out of shape, it is always highly discouraging to have to stop woring out because I simply can't keeo up with the video, so I eventually just stop doing the video, and thus stop working out. However, I find that the low intensity of the cardio segment is great for me. Hopefully, ov er time I will be able to advance to higher impact, but this is a GREAT beginners workout.Furthermore, i love to work my abs, so the beginning segment, while long and a little bit more advandced than my muscles can handle just yet, is a great workout too!"
2,Just OK,"When I first bought the DVD I was so excited, I thought this was going to be a fusion of Pilates and Cardio. I was dissapointed however when I watched it, as there was only a 20 something minute basic pilates rutine, then a 20 something very repetitive cardio section.I have done the Winsor Pilates DVDs and I didn't find this one too challenging, there weren't enough repetitions for me to feel the burn. The cardio section did get me sweating, but it was so repetative.I definitely bought this DVD hoping for a full pilates rutine, so I was a bit dissapointed."
4,Great Workout,I thought the pilates segment was great and really noticed a difference in my body after a few weeks. The only things that bothered me was the cardio segment. The instructor is off tempo most of the time and doesn't cue enough.
2,Unbelievably dull,"As the previous reviewer said, the Pilates half was ok, although I've done a number of much better workouts. The cardio portion was beyond repetitive.Pilates: she did not offer any modification suggestions for people who might have a disability or physical limitation, and some of those exercises are not good without the modifications unless your lower back is already toned & strongCardio: consisted of a whopping 6 moves that lasted an eternal 25 minutes or so. March, hamstring back kicks, reach side, reach over, repeat. Endlessly. She added in a lunge move eventually, and some side punches, but that was it. Also, this may not bother some people, but she was not moving in rhythm with the background music, which I found highly annoying.Stretching/cooldown at end totally insufficient - very little done for the lower body, which was the focus of most of the workout.If you want Pilates videos, I would recommend anything by Ellen Barrett (love the Pick Your Level: Weight Loss Pilates)."
2,Pilates segment okay; cardio segment truly lame!,"The basic pilates mat exercises are performed, which are okay; however, the cardio segment of this video is truly lame! The instructor runs the viewer through marching, marching and stretching one's arm at the same time and, finally, marching and kicking back one's leg. That's it. How incredibly dull! What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration. ""Pilates for Dummies"" is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio). I wouldn't waste your time w/ this video."
3,Great for pilates only,"The pilates section is great. It offers a good variety of workouts and it's intermediate.The cardio section is pretty terrible. It just was SO repetitive and boring and EASY!Buy it only for the pilates. If you are a beginner at cardio, the second section may work for you, just be prepared to get bored!"
5,2 trancendental fiddles,"Al Berard and Karen England have recorded a superb Cajun music CD. It is amazing how powerful 2 fiddles can be without any other instrument backing them up. They play some wonderful old Cajun songs, trading back and forth between melody and seconding.There is an incredible rhythmic groove established between their 2 fiddles, they fit together like a glove. And they also play some songs they wrote, these songs have the feel of the classic form of Cajun fiddling with some unique contemporary flavor. It is a Cd that I haven't stopped playing since I purchased it!!!! For the die-hard fan of Traditional Cajun music, this recording will rate with some of the great masters of the Cajun fiddle, Dewey Balfa and Dennis McGee to name 2 styles represented here. For a person not familiar with the style, you will be treated to a fantastic introduction into a wondrous style of music.I am in love with this CD!!!!"
4,Great 'otherworldly' music. but not enough of it.,"To a musical omnivore like me, who finds something to like in virtually every genre and age, this particular CD is very good, but not quite great. The Hilliard Ensemble gives an excellent performance, as usual, but I don't find this as interesting listening as some of their other recordings. As classical CD's go, it is also just a bit shorter than expected, at about 54 minutes. The a capella performance of the Latin text is excellent, but just a bit monochromatic. I almost miss the effect other recordings give of recording in a great open space, literally ora figuratively in a Medieval cathedral. This is a fine price for a good recording, but I would not go out of my way to recommend it."
4,As expected... and that's a good thing.,"If you know (and like) the work of John Dunstable, and if you know (and like) the performance skills of the Hilliard Ensemble, then you won't be disappointed in this re-issue disc. Nothing ground-breaking, no new insights, just a thoroughly professional and subtly impassioned performance of church music by one of England's most important early composers.Nice recording, too, at a nice price."
3,"Great Pedal, but please fix the pot problems....","Me and some friends have all owned and played this pedal. I love the tone, but after about 2-3 months of using 1-2 times a week for 30 minutes or so, (I don't play live), this pedal always starts cutting in and out when on.I can tap it with my foot on the side and it will either cut most of the effect out of the tone, or even cut the sound completely. All of the pedals of this type I have bought have done this. I would buy again, however. The sound is one of a kind."
4,Plateau is the culmination of ambience,"Great Ambient tracks. Plateau, especially is a perplexing culmination of ambience; at times it sounds so random, at others, so harmonic!!"
2,This is the end of The Orb,"The Orb did some great remix work in the early-'90s and had a few very nice ambient house albums. But in my opinion they soon started to fade and had no idea what to do next. This album, along with ""Pomme Fritz"", doesn't get the job done. There's not a single decent track on this album! Except for the piano intro to ""Oxbow lakes"", there are no hooks or melodies, just a wobbly and dissonant goulash of sound. Obviously this album was made in a very sorry state of mind, because it's unbelievable how chaotically produced and mixed it is. You could call this ""experimental"", but I think this is nothing but poor und uninspired noise. I recommend you to check out some of the Orb's earlier ventures, but this album is palatable for hardcore fans and masochists only."
5,A musical turning point for me,"What can I say about a CD that has changed the direction of my musical tastes and interests? I picked this CD up knowing nothing about it, based on a recommendation on another web site (I was listening to Underworld and the like at the time).To say I was blown away is an understatement to the extreme. This music connected with me in the first listen in a way that I have rarely experienced. The music is so dense, with so many layers, that now - over a year later, I am still discovering new facets. Unlike the Orb's earlier more ""spaced out"" efforts, this CD brings the sound back to the earth, and is filled with sounds of birds chirping and flowing streams...and then all of a sudden Redd Foxx is telling you a story! It truly is like a dream, explanations do not do it justice.HIGHLY recommended to anyone with an open mind."
5,Excellent organization of chaos...,"For those who understand the connection between little pieces of paper and ambient music, BUY THIS. You will not be disappointed. For all you beat phreaks, stear clear; this Orb release is amazing due to the lack of thump."
2,can do better,the orb are without doubt one of the best and most important dance acts around but their previous albums (and orblivion since) attempt to engage the listener while this is in my opinion a lazy arrogant suicide note of a record. Great talent wasted.
2,"Stick to ""Adventures Beyond the Underworld.""","The only redeeming quality of this recording is the quirky final track, ""His Immortial Logness."" The Orb descends once again into incomprehensible random, annoying noise."
2,ddmsays,"I was rather diappointed with this CD. I was expecting to hear Craig Duncan & The Smokey Mtn. Band.Instead it was the smae old instruments over & over. I liked the tunes,but it would have been way better with usual Smokey Mtn. group. This is the third time I have run into this with CD's having Craig Duncans name on them but not having the Smokey Mtn. Band playing."
4,Harman Kardon HKTS 14,"Due to a move and resulting space constraints, I needed to replace my full size front JBL speakers, and decided to invest in a new speaker system. My son got the old JBLs and he is thrilled. After some research, I settled on the HKTS14 and have been very satisfied. The satellites are small and stylish so they blend into the decor very nicely. Mounting the speakers on the wall using the supplied brackets was a bit of a PITA, but each sucessive installation became easier. The huge sub fits into the corner of my room and is very unobtrusive. The sound is so realistic that it fools my dog into thinking that he is hearing actual events rather than just the TV. I did have a problem with my 20 yo receiver not dealing with the sub all too well, so I got an HK635 and all is well now. All in all, a great sounding speaker system at a reasonable price."
4,A tremendous value for the price,This speaker set is value priced far below what the performance it gives. I was pleasantly suprised.
5,This is New Age BEFORE it was Hip!,This is a compilation of the four critical Jade Warrior recordings on Island Records from 1974 to 1978. I had these albums when they came out. The sound is a natural one as opposed to much of the 'Enoish' electrocia. Give it a spin.
1,Arlinton are much easier to use.,"These are OK for a single gang box but still don't always fit that well, but if you have a double gang box, good luck finding a Carlon extender to fit. If you have a triple or four gang box, forget it...they don't make them! These things will not nest side by side. They are too rigid, and have unnecessary molded bosses. They become a pain in the butt. Buy the Arlington brand instead. They are flexible and easy to trim if needed. They even make extenders for single through four gang, if you can find them. The three and four gang ones are new and not readily available yet. I am really disappointed in Carlon, being a big name in electrical supply."
4,Good construction but handle not safe,Using it as a tea pot for Chai making and working fine till date. it has been stained inside and that will not wash off and the handle sometime tends to get hot. using it on the Nesco PIC-14 Portable Induction Cook top. Good value for money for Induction Cookware
3,good for the price,"These are sturdy, but know that the handles get really hot! Burns will happen. All-Clad and Calphalon's handles stay cool for much longer, always use potholders when cooking with Wearever. Aside from that they are pretty good, a bit on the heavy side. Lids could fit tighter for making rice, etc."
1,WearEver Stinless Steel,"The product PICTURED is actually a wonderful product and I would give it 5 stars. The problem is you do not get the items pictured. The 9-1/2-inch stainless steel saute has been replaced by two aluminum frying pans with non-stick coating. My child ordered this for a sibling's wedding gift and contacted Amazon after he did not get the items pictured. They have made no change in the image even though this is not what you receive. As a longtime customer of Amazon, I am truly disappointed that Amazon continues to sell this item with a misleading picture. This is truly false advertising. As a result, we have looked elsewhere to purchase the pan set for the wedding."
4,"Wearever pan set with strain and pour feature, very handy","I have finally gone back to regular pans as opposed to non stick. I worried about all the cancer scares with the non stick coating, and was tired of eventually having to replace pans that got scratched. I love the strain and pour pans and wouldn't trade this feature for all the tea in China. The only thing that I don't like (at all) is that the lid handles get hot and while my other pan lids didn't do this, I have burned myself (not severely) several times. I have non stick pans with glass lids that have plastic coated handles, so this seems like a major mistake to me (making a lid handle that will burn you if you don't use a hot pan holder). I will eventually get used to this and stop touching the hot handles on the lids but I must admit, I am a character of habit. I am finally making real mashed potatoes again because I have a regular pan interior that can take the mashing."
4,Nice set of pots for the money,I have had this set for about a year now. Everything has held up well. I bought the set for the straining feature which I have found useless. On more than one occation I have attempted to strain food w/ the lid and have ended up butning myself of just accidently let the lid fall off then the food falls in the sink! It would be a great feature if the lids had some kind of locking feature for people like me :-D Overall nice set of pots on a budget.
3,love it,"I love this set. I am disappointed that the lid for the dutch oven was missing. i miss that since none of my old lids from other pan sets don't fit. If I get the lid soon than stars would go up,. also the pic shows 3 piece utility set, but i recieved only two and got a strainer in place of the spatula. No biggie on that just want the lid.....please.."
4,Beautiful Pans,"My mom is going to be thrilled with these lovely strainer lidded pans, but the true test of a good saucepan and frying pan is time!"
3,Big Surprise,"I love this cookware. It has those neat little draining holes. Makes it convenient when you don't want to drop the contents into a conventional drainer. The big shock came when the shipping charge was only a few dollars less than the product charge. Dudes and Dudettes, this is too much. I will never, ever order this item again. I'll buy it but I won't order it."
4,very happy with this set,"My husband bought this pan set because he was looking for a smaller sauce pan than my smallest one for cooking on the grill and he knew I liked this line of pans. So he's claimed the smallest pan in this set for melting butter and seasoning when he's grilling. The rest I use in my kitchen.I like the whole set, it cleans up easily, cooks evenly and the spouts on the sides pour nicely. The lids don't fit completely tightly but tight enough for every day cooking. The knobs can get hot while you're cooking, use a potholder if you're straining something and the knob is too hot. It's a very reasonably priced pan set for every day cooking.The utensils are decently made as well, and I use the slotted spoon frequently. The spatula wound up with my husband's grilling stuff as well because I prefer silicone spatulas."
3,Made in China,"Pretty cookware. But I would not had bought it had I knew it was Made in China. Did a search on cookware & Wearever was listed as still being made in USA. Like I said the cookware looks nice & feels heavy enough, haven't cooked in it yet, I just hate sending my money to China."
4,WOW.....,"WELL JUST GOT THE BOX FROM FED-X...OPENED IT AND THERE THEY WERE SHINNY POTS AND PANS...AT FIRST GLANCE I AM IMPRESSED......CAN'T WAIT TO USE THEM...VERY NICE LOOKING AND APPEAR TO BE WELL MADE ! BUT HEAT HAS A WAY OF TELLING THE TRUE TAIL....LOL....I WILL SEE SOONER OR LATER.....WHEN I FIRE THEM UP, I WILL WRITE FOLLOW UP REVIEW...STAY TUNED....."
5,Got these as a starter kit for my just out of the house 21 year old niece,"First I opened the box to make sure they were useful quality. They seemed adequate- my main concern is that pans have thick enough bottoms so that things don't burn and scorch. I think they will be adequate for a young 20 something's busy lifestyle (that involves a lot of quick, not-fancy food)."
3,sause pan is steaky,"this is my 2nd set! the thing is in the first set i had, the sauce pan had a tefal coating, this one is stainless steel, i ended up with the pan that is burning the food, and this sauce pan was the actual reason i got it, over all it's decent, but the sauce pan is killing me!!"
3,Not what I expected,I purchased this set in hopes of making my canning and jelly making easier. The pots are not large enough and the lid handles get way too hot to touch. The picture does not depict what you will get. I got a medium size colander with it instead of the 3 utensils shown. I will have to puchase another pot to make my jellies and the pour spout leaves something to be desired. It is way to small. If you are looking to just heat up a can of veggies and drain them it is okay. I was expecting more for the money I spent. Thank you for your time.Billie-Jo
2,Too much talk and a waste of money!.,"I thought I was purchasing a ""weight training/body sculpting"" video. Unfortunately I did not. Most of the video is wasted with two older women describing exercises that anyone can do by just observing.I assumed the video would have a quick 2-3 minute demo at the beginning, then 30 minutes or so of weight training accompanied by an instructor's verbal commands with appropriate music as I do in my body-sculpting class. Instead these women and their chatter are featured throughout the video. It's as if the purpose of the video is to showcase these women instead of weight training.Do not buy this video if you are looking for a good strength traininng video. I'm 61 and it's worthless."
3,Tedious,"If you are already an active person, used to an exercise routine with a moderate to high intensity level, you may be disappointed in this DVD. There was too much talk and not enough action for me. I did, however, learn a bit about correct form when lifting free weights, but I was disappointed that the workout wasn't more intense. In short, if you are a beginner, in need of an instructional video, this is the one for you."
2,Very disappointing - not recommended.,"The instructor takes up too much time in talking, and in a too-condescending voice, more appropriate for children. Neither of the participants has a good sense of rhythm - why use music if you're not going to keep time? Then, after the workout, no stretch. I would not have bought this had I seen it first - it was a waste of money for my requirements. It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because if you ignore the criticisms above and put a lot of effort into it you can end up with a halfway-decent workout. But any workout should have a stretching section at the end!"
5,slower but thorough - we speed through the talking...,"Good exercises for those of us out of shape and trying desperately to keep up with the fast paced ""beginner"" exercise DVD's that aren't! My husband approves of this one that we borrowed from the library and will now order for ourselves to use again and again. We fast forwarded through the talking and eventually she gets down to the exercises. We liked that they did the exercises slightly differently AND that they alternated muscle groups so we could keep going but got more reps on each type of exercise. We enjoyed it."
2,talk too much,"I was looking for a good basic strength training video that does not have fit 20-somethings hopping around. This one fits that bill but falls short of what I wanted. It is a very simple routine that is made extra long by too much talking between the instructors. Instruction is fine, but they go overboard. They also cannot keep a beat. One of them is very smug and seems overly pleased with herself throughout the video. I wish I had rented it first."
2,Not Blum's best work!,"I was very disappointed with John Morton Blum's biography on Theodore Roosevelt. I found it to be poorly written and some chapters were rather ambiguous and confusing.The first few chapters were good but the book steadily went downhill from there. Theodore Roosevelt was such a lively, exciting character and Blum's book did not bring out any of that excitement. I found the book informative but very boring and dull."
4,Worth your money,"I got that video along with other ww2 video i ordered from amazon such as the battle of the bulge/dunkirk/george stevens d-day to berlin and d-day:assault on fotress europe. But that video was far the best from all...The most of the content is about the eastern front,but other stuff is included as well(balkan,afrika etc etc).In particular every important battle where panzers played an important role in...But you will see not only panzers and stuff in the movie but also a lot of warscenes with soldiers and other stuff... It is one of the best world war 2 videos i own because it features some very nice and fitting background music and the sound is extrememly good for a documentation...Sometimes i thought it was stereo when some artillerie was firing...Really great video.And the authors really took always exactly fitting scenes to the soundtracks...Get it!!!"
1,Worst Ninja Movie ever,"This steaming pile of excrement stars the one and only Doug Ivan as the half Japanese, half Italian ninja Kwanji. I won't waste any time describing the plot of this movie, just know that the force of the ninja involves running away from the bad guys until they get tired of chasing and give up. Only then does Kwanji leap from the shadows to deliver the death blow, usually in the form of foam Chinese stars. If you do rent this movie, if you can even find it, make sure you watch the previews, they are the funniest 10 minutes of film I have ever seen. This movie deserves no stars, but one is as low as this thing lets me go."
3,"Great Film, Misleading Product","While this adaptation of ""True Grit"" is fantastic, the product itself is a little misleading: This is NOT the film on Blu-Ray, but rather a Blu-Ray disc of extra content. The film itself is on plain old DVD. I am strictly reviewing this as a product - the film itself and most of the extras are definitely excellent, quality content."
1,Huge disappointment. Acting was a huge disappointment...,Actors were miscast. Acting tried way too hard. The whole movie felt hollow - the original was way better. This was annoying to watch.
1,Horrible,"Are you kidding me. I cut this movie off half way through. What a waste of time and money. Bad acting, writing and boring story line."
1,I really wanted to like this movie,"I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation as I'm a huge fan of the original film. This however was a great disappointment. I don't understand how such good actors could collectively turn in such a poor performance. I saw no passion whatsoever. This is a testament to the idea that just having a great cast does not make for a great movie. There was absolutely no chemistry between any of the actors. I hate to place all the blame on the cast but in my very humble opinion that is exactly where the failure of this movie to entertain rests, square on the shoulders of the actors."
1,Terrible Grit,This is the worst remake I have ever seen. It looked like some fifth graders put it together. One star is extremely generous. Story line and casting did not make it for me.I will be selling or trading this.
2,Doesn't come close.,"I wanted to compare this movie with the orginal with John Wayne. Doesn't even come close, but if you didn't know JW thenI suppose you might like it.Jeff Bridges is no match for John Wayne. Some people make good cowboys and some don't. What more can I say.I would suggest the western movies of Tomestone, Lonesome Dove, Dancing with Wolves, etc."
2,Glad the movie was free.,I couldn't tell if some of the caste has other things to do and talked fast to get this over with and the other half was plumb drunk with cotton balls stuffed in their mouths. I missed much of the dialogue.The story was good but the talking was annoying for the above reasons. Watching True Grit was an okay way to kill some time but I am glad I didn't bother going to a theater to see it.
3,Great Movie. To much big talk for the Girl Character.,"I love the movie. I love westerns and this also has a bit of comedy in it. The only parts that I didn't like; it was slow at times and the main character spoke too much, too fast, and too over my head. I can't stand too much talking in a movie. I know that it was a build up of the type of character she was, but it still drove me nuts every time she opened her mouth."
3,You Don't Need a Surround Sound System for This,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was very good...great...but seemed to lack fine detail. I recently watched Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown on Blu-Ray, and you could really see the detail in the faces. This movie just didn't seem to have that detail.The movie was an hour and 50 minutes long, with 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The audio was DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, but there really wasn't much surround sound. You really don't need a fancy surround sound system for this movie.This movie wasn't nearly as good as the original John Wayne movie. It was half over before there was any action or excitement, and then it still wasn't that good."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"As much hype as this movie received, I was expecting more. The acting was good, but I felt like the characters could have been better developed. I'm sure there was a point behind the styling of dialogue, but it just felt forced. Overall, it was decent entertainment to compliment a lazy afternoon of folding laundry and ironing. I didn't hate it, but it's not something I would bother to watch again."
3,Different than the original,"This was an alright movie. It was a little slow, but the acting way good. I wouldn't run out to see it, but it isn't a terrible way to spend an evening."
2,A Dust Collector,"After hearing all of the promo for this version, my husband, who loves westerns, just had to have it. His opinion is ""it's boring"".I am not so easily impressed and waited until the local price dropped from $30 to $10 before buying it. I thought it was poorly filmed and the story choppy.On the positive side, the girl is less annoying and less wooden than the original and the men tried do a good job with their roles.We found it disappointing and unsatisfying and it will now collect dust in it's rack. This is not because it is not John Wayne but, because it is just not a good movie."
4,it's the Language,"Anyone who complains that this film interpretation of the book ""Is boring"" DULL...""too much talk"" are unable to understand that the lost language represented here is as much a character as the players themselves. It's a great re-visioning of a familiar tale. I think it was one of the year's better films."
5,Loved it...,Much better than the original. Jeff Bridges is amazing in his role as a drunken burned out TX ranger and Matt Damon plays a great role as well.
3,I like Barton and No Country a lot more than this,"The problem here was that the Coen Brothers didn't write this story, they just adapted it.This movie is too standard and old school for the Coens, who usually do totally bizarre and creative thingsin their films, such as the John Goodman character in Barton Fink, or Javier Bardem's dark persona inNo Country.Bridges was almost unintelligible, and Damon was flat.This lacked the cinematic and storytelling uniqueness that the brothers are famous for."
2,Booooooo......,"While Jeff Bridges did a good job in the lead role, the script of this movie comes across like a light-hearted comedy. There was no suspense, and everything was predictable. Not only that, the bad accents the actors spewed out were so heavy that it was nearly indecipherable. The last few minutes of the movie is simply hokey non-sense, typical Spielberg tripe."
2,did not live up to the hype,I found the first 3/4 of the movie boring and slow with no depth. The last 1/4 got a little bit better but predictable. Overall I found the movie mostly boring with mediocre acting. Not sure how this got so many 5 star reviews. I guess some people are easily impressed.
1,Total waste of time to watch and to produce,The acting was too tired with little or no energy. Bridges brought nothing to the movie except his name. Don't waste your time.
2,Not The Best Coen Brothers Western,"I don't remember the original version of True Grit. But I did read the Cormac McCarthy book No Country For Old Men and enjoyed the Coen Brothers film of that name with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin.This version of True Grit was a disappointment for me. I would like to see a film of another Cormac McCarthy novel. All The Pretty Horses (1992) has been done. McCarthy's greatest novel was Blood Meridian (1985). It would not be easy to film because it requires a large cast.Blood Meridian has been called the greatest American novel since William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying."
2,TERRIBLE!,"I like Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges, but this movie is absolutely TERRIBLE. John Wayne would roll over in his grave if he saw this after the one that he had made. Not worth your time!!"
3,"Boring, lack of emotion","I wanted to like this, hoping that the cynics were just being overly negative. Unfortunately, it was slow and boring, with a surprising lack of humor, and very little feeling. I am not a big fan of westerns, but had hoped it might have just a little hint of the brilliance of a film such as Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"", or the humor of the original True Grit, but that was sadly not the case. Count my wife and me both sleepy and disappointed by the end."
2,Very disappointing,"It is lacking in spirit and excitement compared to the original. Cogburn does make a better case for being a drunk, because I can only understand about half of what he says which contributed to my losing interest in this movie. Matt Damon is a good actor usually, this just isn't his role or movie. Pass this one up and pick something else."
5,It Must Be Mine!,"Considering the fact that John Wayne is the one brought to mind when the words 'True Grit' are uttered, I must say that I give the movie all five stars instead of four or four-and-a-half because Jeff Bridges and the other actors in the film have taken all the characters to new levels. Being such a great fan of the Coen brothers' work, I had planned on buying the movie simply based on that circumstance, knowing that it would be great. But my family rented the movie online last night and, sure enough, my expectations were superseded. So, as the title of this review proclaims, the DVD must now be mine!"
1,don't bother,"Boy, what a stinker, this could be one of the worst westerns ever made. I am a huge western fan & have seen my share of bad ones, but this one takes the cake. Save your money & don't even see it for free. You have been warned !"
1,Horse Abuse,"in general, this was a well casted and acted movie.But it was destroyed for me by the horse abuse scene near the end where Jeff Bridges rides a beautiful, courageous horse into the ground and shoots it despite the wishes of his co-star who is the owner of the horse.This movie should be banned for the insensitive treatment of wonderful animals. That warning does not even show up on the rating for children less than 15 and is a travesty.I hope this move is destroyed and banned from all future showings.I am going to destroy my copy and hope everyone else will too.No animal abuse like this should be portrayed even if no animals were actuallyTrue Grit (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)hurt."
2,several horse-stabbing/shooting scenes caught me off guard,"Take away those parts and you have a fine cinematic work here. I felt these parts were completely unnecessary, imo."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this lousy remake!,"Wooden acting, stilted dialogue. Nice set decoration is about the only good thing you can say about this movie. Very POOR attempt at a re-make of a classic Western."
1,horrible,"How anyone could call this even a good movie, much less compare it to an all time classic is beyond me. Terrible acting & boring. Why is everyone using that dum accent? Couldnt finish, dont waste your money. i would give it zero stars if they would let me."
1,True Grit - the Remake,"I haven't figured out what people see in this remake of the original John Wayne classic movie. Oh, sure, the picture has higher resolution and the colors are better but I found Jeff Bridges was a poor replacement for J.W. The movie also deviated from the original in quite a number of scenes, making this newer version, although overall moderately accurate, much less interesting than the original. If you haven't seen the original J.W. version then the latest release may get you by if you like Westerns but only one or two actors in this version are doing characters in an acceptable manner and most of them are not any of the main characters. Mostly, I found this a waste of a couple of hours."
5,Better than the Duke?,"Saw this in the theater (twice) and had to add it to my library. I hate to say it, but I think this version is better than the original. I thought the movie stayed closer to the book and portrayed the main characters more realistically. Being a gun buff, I appreciated the use of the correct firearms. I will definitly watch this movie again (and again)."
4,Very good remake of a classic......,"I enjoy remakes of classic films Sometimes. If they are remade with quality craftsmanship as was this film True Grit, Jeff Bridges pulls it off as Roster Cogburn. I enjoyed the remake very much as modern photography can make a difference along with camera angles to enhance the experence as compared to the older classic. I liked this one better than the original. The colors were great and the photography and sets captured the feel ( and smells ) of the old west. I give it 4-1/2 Stars. I will always tell it like I see it.Scott M"
2,The New True Grit,"Liked the original story better than the remake. Liked John Wayne better than Jeff Bridges, but I did like Matt Damon better than Glenn Campbell and the young girl in the remake better than Kim Darby. Overall, I feel the original was much, much better."
5,True Grit,I love this movie and it bring back the great american western type movie that I grew up with. I think it's on equal par with John Waynes True Grit. I love them both.
3,i liked it (3.5),"for me,this was a pretty decent movie,although overall,i liked the original 1969 version a bit more.i found this one dragged a little bit for my taste.it could have been a bit shorter.the acting was good though,especially by Hailee Steinfeld who played young Mattie Ross.i felt she has a lot of screen presence.the scenery was also very nice,and the action scenes were well done.i also liked the dialogue.if you liked the original,there are some things about this version you may like as well.it's all about personal taste.it;s directed by Joel and Ethan Coen,who always put put their own spin on things.if you're a fan of the Coen Brothers,you might want to check this one out.for me, True Grit (2010) is a 3.5/5"
5,True Grit,"Overall ""True Grit' was quite entertaining. I was not aware that it was a remake when I watched it at the theater so I didn't have any expectations in mind as to how it would play out. Jeff Bridges does a superb acting job as well as the little girl that plays the center role in the film. Matt Damon portrays a somewhat comedic role, with the aid of a hilarious moustache, that is also to be applauded. The characters speak in a very formal Western vernacular throughout the film which adds a quirky element to the film but which I also found to be entertaining. Fun film that takes it's time unfolding and focuses more on characters than action."
5,The Girl's Got Grit,"Very entertaining, and it really stands alone from the original movie. Hailee Steinfeld steals the show, her portrayal of Mattie Ross is brilliant. Hands down she's the one with the True Grit and really makes this movie such a treat to watch. Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon weren't bad, but Haille gave this movie some real spark."
5,Bridges' True Grit Truer to the Book,"The new release of True Grit obviously has been compared to John Wayne's great movie. While Wayne's movie followed the book and used much of the dialogue from it, the new version does a better job of telling the story as presented in the book and conveying the story's true spirit. Gone is the humor of the original designed to lighten the darkness of the story. Mattie is the storyteller in the book and she is the main character in the new movie instead of Rooster Cogburn. Bridges' portrayal of Cogburn emphasizes the lawman's cynicism and hardness. Mattie is hard as nails and sees the world in black and white, while Cogburn sees shades of grey, often tending toward the darker shades.While Wayne's version will always be a favorite of mine, this version is much better."
4,True Grit is Back!,"Just watched this movie last night. As a life long John Wayne fan, and one who thinks the original True Grit was one of his best, I do believe he would have been pleased with this remake. Jeff Bridges is wonderful in his role. The movie is NOT the original. It is a classic in its own right."
1,Worst Western In Years,No stars for this terrible remake of a classic. Jeff Bridges sounds like he has mush in his mouth along with several other characters. Is this the best Hollywood can come up with? Even the music was bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
1,As bad as it gets!,"An absolutely pretentious western; indeed, a terrible movie. Rooster Cogburn's exaggerated ""harelip"" speech pattern were appalling and tedious. Couple that with a ""2011-ish"" smart alec, know-it-all teen, Ross, and you have the makings of a blunderous film. Surprised that she isn't trying to intimidate Rooster with her supreme texting"" skills as she plods along on her nag. What anybody sees in this movie is beyond me. A waste of time and money. True Grit is True Sh#* !!"
1,Another Matt Damon Failure,"My goodness, I would have thought something better with the story, but Damon is just one horrible actor and ruins everything he's in, there has only been two good shows with him: Bourne and Good Will Hunting, and the stories saved him.When will he be ran out of town? His attempt at an accent it laughable. Any producer should refuse to have him on the bill.The movie itself is very slow, and not very well put together. Better than some of the hold ""Westerns"" but still not worth the money."
1,What?,"What a load of nonsensical crap! The film did not flow, the story line was.....well......non-existant, acting was strained. Overall, very boring and I wouldn't waste your evening on this film."
3,Illusion blown......,"I tried! I did. I watched the entire movie in the theater. Five minutes in? What did Jeff Bridges say? Was the sound too low? It was so hard for me to understand him..... was it being a drunk cowboy with old speech(1800's)?And then...... what transpired to Matt Damon's tongue.......And Josh Brolin,,,,, I think they had marbles in there mouths. I have read a few westerns and saw many so........hmmm....thumbs sideways!!!!! not up not down..."
3,Long Live John Wayne,"I think Jeff Bridge does mumble way too much, did he have marbles in his mouth?. I like Jeff Bridges also but he is not John Wayne. The film really was too slow compared to the 1969 version. Not sure I even liked Matt Damon in his roll and I like Matt Damon. Some say that Glen Campbell could not act (I thought he did a good job) but I feel Matt may have over acted and the script and dialog was odd. I liked Glen Campbell over Matt Damon. I know the end is how the book ends (I have not read the book) but for us who remember and love the 1969 John Wayne version you will not like this one as much if at all. It was an odd movie all the way through and I kept thinking it was going to get better and bust out with action...but no. I bought it and will keep it on my shelf but I am pretty sure I will watch the John Wayne version more often. For what it's worth I did like the girl and feel she did a good job. Maybe it will grow on me after 2-3 more viewings."
2,Dont do it men,"If you are looking for a western gun slinging movie - go watch Tombstone again for the 10th time. True Grit...ouch it was painful. Have you ever bitten into something with a piece of sand or grit in it? **Wince** Well thats what I felt when watching True Grit. Besides some good film work, pictures, and a handful of decent sarcastic jokes this move was bad. AND I LIKE BAD MOVIES! But this one stunk. And I am not exaggerating. The reason I said ""dont do it Men"" bc my wife came back from work saying her young (20's) female coworker was pulled in by the terrible 14 year old girl who goes on the trail with Jeff Bridges character. She thought it was fun... What would have been fun is if i would have counted the number of times during the movie I was wishing for the power to go out and not feel obliged to finish watching this movie. yes Hollywood publicized the crap out of this movie...But they lied to us again. So let me say one more time. Dont do it men."
2,I would NOT recommend you buy this movie,"I purchased this movie, on Blu-ray, for Father's Day. We watched the movie the other night and I must say I am pretty disappointed. With all the advertising and buzz around this movie, I figured it had to be good, and since my Dad loves John Wayne, I also figured he'd enjoy this. The movie just never really goes anywhere. I would recommend that you rent this movie from Netflix, Redbox DVD, Zune Marketplace, Playstation Store, Amazon Digital Marketplace, or from DIRECTV. I would not recommend you buy this."
2,Disappointing!,"I'm certainly open to remakes. I enjoy the new Hawaii Five-0 every week even though I own the first 10 seasons of the original. But this remake is very disappointing. It moves very slowly and is more dialogue than action. I like Jeff Bridges but all he does in this movie is mumble and he is a disaster as Cogburn. It's very hard to understand what he is saying. Also, he doesn't get the same laughs as John Wayne did saying the same lines. I didn't think the young actress was that great either. She was good, but not as fantastic as critics made it sound like. If this movie is closer to the book, then I never want to read the book. It was boring, slow and very disappointing. Too bad because it was full of good actors. I say rent and don't buy."
5,Terrific Film- The Coens at their Best,"I'm a huge Coen Brothers fan and his movie is a terrific example of why. Like most of their films it is obviously a Coen Brothers movie yet is simultaneously original and distinct. It is by turns funny, sad, gruesome, and uplifting. And it is always engaging. A terrific film and a much watch for Coen fans and movie-lovers in general."
5,Great Movie,Good Price for a fantastic movie. Haley is a fantastic young actress and I would think we'll see her in a lot of movies in the near future. Great job of acting by the entire cast!!!
2,BORING,"The problem with remakes is if you stick too close to the original without using creativity it can just be terribly boring. If you exercise creative liberty in the remake, the other group is indignant.Well here you have the boring. The original was actually much better and more intense. The girl actress was just annoying, Jeff Bridges was trying to channel his John Wayne, just made for an awful duo. Did the Coen brothers really make this one?"
3,Good acting but very slow all the way to the end.,"A lot has already been said about the plot and how it compares with the original movie with John Wayne. I was brought in by the good reviews, actors that I have consistently liked, and expected to enjoy the movie. I watched the entire movie and was consistently wondering when the plot was going to advance. It is definitely a drama and I am not sure how much of an action movie it is. There is almost no suspense and you can tell after the first 10 minutes how it will probably end with a fair amount of accuracy.The good lies in the acting and directing. Character development was very good and I actually cared about the people but when the movie was over I asked myself, ""So what?"" It did not leave me disturbed, happy, energized, depressed or anything other than indifferent."
3,The acting was fine but not so the movie itself,"Many people judge actors when watching movies but the truth is most ""bad acting"" is either because of the script or the producer... it seems to be the same script as the John Wayne version, but some how the story seems off some how, I could actually get up and walk away from the movie without any pull to bring me back through-out the film."
2,Real Problems,"This is a great movie, no question. But I have been unable to get either Apple or Paramount to fix a major problem with buying this Combo. The digital copy simply will not transfer to my iPad or my iPhone. I can play it on my computer, but it will not transfer. I have exchanged it for another disc--Amazon, as usual, has been wonderfully cooperative--and the same thing was true. It cannot be my hardware since I have tried to transfer it from my iTunes to three different devices, and it wouldn't transfer to any of them."
1,Disappointing,Unfortunately a lot of great actors and couldn't hold a candle to John Wayne. The dialog was not very positive at the end.
3,mediocre,"With the great star studded cast I thought this was really going to be epic. It wasn't. In fact, it was quite boring. I wanted to give it two stars but as I said, I like the cast. *shrugs*"
3,Its OK,love the Dude (Bridges) and wish I could give this more stars but it was just good enough to keep me awake and wish that I went to sleep earlier.
4,"Okay, not wow, but quite a surprise","Expected little (most Jeff Bridges roles are simply Jeff Bridges, no one else), only to find a character we loved (the girl) and Matt Damon did great (would have liked to see more of him!).Many times we busted out loud laughing, the surprise quips they insulted eachother with were hysterical (but not enough!). While I felt I'd like to see the Texas ranger's return or follow up to his life, my husband said he felt closure with the ending.Lots of violent killing --had to cover my kids' eyes at a few points. A bit of blasphemy which I felt was unneeded (never is needed!). Stunning scenery, too.All in all it was an exciting Western; gorey and realistic in grit.I'd like to see this young lady continue on with her acting, she was very lovely, easy to understand (unlike most of the cowboys) and convincing."
1,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,"Without wanting to give away any of the storyline, I must say that this was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no redeeming value to any of the characters or the story itself. If you are looking for a reason to become hooked on anti-depressants watching this movie is for you, otherwise save yourself the money and buy any other movie currently being sold. I promise you that whatever else you buy it will be a much better choice."
3,a must own dvd,"I am changing my statement I think the actors who play in this remake are cool so i give it up to the actors, good job, still got the western way and i liked itsome cool jokes, but still good story line and trying to keep the way john wayne did it"
3,John Wayne version is so much better!!!!!!,"The Duke was a presence that no one could match on screen. Jeff tries but fails in his character speech. He tends to speak so hard at times in this movie that he is hard to understand.....Matt Damon is a great actor, but is givin a very weak part in this film. It's a shame! This film could have been so much better..........."
1,Sorry.,The John Wayne version a much better movie and better entertainment. Why did they bother with this? Made half this version in the dark; cheaper I guess.
2,Colossally Disappointing,"Despite its superb cast, True Grit hangs on the screen for an hour and fifty-one minutes as dry and lifeless as baccala. Jeff Bridges' incoherent mumbling left even this denizen of the Deep South yearning for English subtitles. Glad I chose to rent and not buy."
3,One positive? No Glen Cambell,"Jeff Bridges is a wonderful actor that somehow was persuaded, probably monetarily to replay a role no one should have tried. You just don't ""redo"" the Duke (who in real life probably drank at least as much as the good Mr. Cogburn and seemed born to play Cogburn in his latter years).Matt Damon was a tremendous improvement upon the torture one had to endure in the original with Glen Campbells performance as La Boef....the man could sing and play guitar....but he could NOT act.And Berry Pepper trying to play Robert Duvalls original role? Almost as heretical as Mr. Bridges attempt at taking on Waynes role as Cogburn.Worthy only for the abscence of Glen Campbell.When I heard Mr. Bridges mouth the words, ""Fill your hands you Sons of Bitches"", I almost felt like I was at an Islamic performance of ""The Rapture""."
2,True Grit (2010),"111 minutes I'll never get back. Sorry folks but this is one lousy picture. It gets one star for Jeff Bridges, try as he may his character lacks development and is chalked full of stereo types which are just silly; not very a sympathetic portrayal either. A second star for the set, they made a concerted effort to recreate the old west; perhaps to distract from the lousy direction, cinematography, and hasty flow of the scenes. So much potential with this cast of actors but I got the sense early on that I was being shuffled forward in order to just get to the end. And the ending, pffft; with little sentiment as though there was no meaning to any of it."
5,nice!!!,As good as it gets when remaking a classic. My eleven year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
5,Much better than the Wayne version,"Being a fan of the Wayne version, I didn't think I'd like this movie much, but this rendition of the book is much closer to the source material both in the casting and the dialog than the original Wayne version. Unlike the previous movie, this is set in a darker, more dangerous world that showcases that not only is Mattie a headstrong, impetuous young girl, but she is also brave as you can see her wrestle with her fear when she realizes just how dangerous this endeavor will be. One of my all-time favorite westerns."
4,"True Grit, True Western","If you grew up with westerns, this remake of True Grit will not disappoint. All three of the main characters are played expertly and you will find it very difficult to not appreciate the young actress (Hailee Steinfeld) who plays Mattie Ross. Her bargaining powers are incredible.Although this movie does follow the book more closely than the John Wayne version, there are liberties taken and some story-changing, but this will not detract from the viewing pleasure.I highly recommend this film and purchased it for my library."
4,Good movie,"We were well-entertained by the intermittent humor in this movie. Granted, it makes you miss The Duke, but we felt the actors did a really good job in this re-make of a classic."
4,"Very good, but better with subtitles...","This movie was very well done, but half the things Rooster says are unintelligible. You may find subtitles helpful."
2,In one word: boring.,"Confusing and not as great as people make it out to be, but to each their own. Original was way better."
3,john wayne is best,the first is better than the 2nd this movie is short the first is about 2hr this is like 1hr just the girl is a better actor.
2,Oldie is better,The original version with John Wayne is superior to the new rendition. I wasted my money buying this copy Took too many liberties in modifying the script.
3,Should have rented it first,"It was a good movie but I could have lived without buying it, I needed a western movie to round out my collection. I guess I went with the wrong one. I say its just ok. The girl was good, damon sucked and the old guy could have been replaced by a puppet and no one would have been the wiser"
3,Half baked,"I like the movie opening, especially the re-creation of the Arkansas town . It has an authentic feel unseen in any other western. Beyond this the storyline line plays like an average telefilm. I am not too impressed with the caricatural performance of Jeff Bridges . Matt Damon ( one of my favorite actors ) is totally out of step . I guess I expected a lot more after the monumental "" No country for old men """
1,Even A Second Look Didn't Help,"I also really wanted to like this re-make of ""True Grit,"" but even a second viewing couldn't help. This version - starring Jeff Bridges - is vastly inferior to the 1969 version even if - as remarked - it is truer to the novel (hey, sometimes a novel is simply not as good as its screenplay). The Bridge's version suffers from actors who are trying too hard not to repeat dialogue in the same manner as in the classic John Wayne version and, as a result, either mumble or fumble the film's most classic lines. The acting is stilted and some of the players are clearly miscast, such as Matt Damen as La Boeuf (amazingly even non-actor Glen Campbell gave a more credible performace in the eariler version).In sum, highly recommend letting this one go."
3,Not bad,"The original is better, but this remake wasn't bad. My biggest problem with the film was Jeff Bridges' mush mouth made it difficult to understand what he was saying. Not sure why they had him speak like that. John Wayne sure did not speak with a mush mouth.The girl who played Mattie Ross did an outstanding job. She was very convincing and powerful. A very talented young actress."
5,As gritty as it gets,"True Grit gripped me like no other western has done in a while. I have never seen the original by John Wayne or maybe I have but I don't remember because his movies seem very similar to me. In this version, the characters of the story are so well acted that I got really immersed in girl's quest for justice for her father. And the title is so apt because all the protagonists did show real gumption. I don't like sanitized westerns where the surroundings are clean, the actors clean-shaven, and the women look like they just came from the beauty parlor. This movie is very realistic and down to earth gritty."
5,Excellent Western,"This is an excellent remake of a classic John Wayne movie. This movie is a welcomed addition to my western collection. It follows the book very closely with era clothing, weapons and the area that was selected in the filming. Excellent movie...."
4,not as good as the old one,I watched it through and it was really close to the original. But I am sorrythat it is not as good without John Wayne. JW is what made the old one a classic. I did have fast delivery as I always do with Amazon. The purchase was smooth.
5,For Those Hesitating,"I just wonder if Hollywood has any more original ideas due to all the remakes. And to remake one of the Duke's most beloved films! When I first heard about it coming out I scoffed. You don't mess with John Wayne classics. Then I saw the Academy Award talk. And then I read that its not a remake, its based on the book, not the earlier movie. And I saw an interview with Jeff Bridges who said he wasn't trying to copy or outdo John Wayne. So, when the price dropped, I bought it. And I am glad I did. I never found myself comparing it to the Duke's version, not one time, its a different movie. It's a great western so if you were holding out on it, don't, its worth the ride."
4,What a western !,"This is awesome, i'm not giving 5 stars because i would wanted more action, but its a very good movie, i've watched 4 times by now."
2,"""I did not know that...""","If you haven't seen the movie then the phrase ""I did not know that"" doesn't mean much except to say you will hear it a lot in this movie. I appreciate a movie written for the time period however I found the prose didn't add to the quality of the movie. It didn't make me feel as if I were part of the times which is one of the intent of the writer.With that being said the movie felt forced. The acting was good (much better than the first) but it felt rushed and didn't entertain me nor was I able to get asorbed into the movie."
5,"Great Movie! Great Soundtrack, Actors, and Plot","I loved this movie! The language seems a bit different (maybe back then they didn't use contractions), but you get used to it. The acting is superb on every level, the plot, interesting. Loved it! Just a great movie!"
3,Not John Wayne,"I remember the original version of True Grit and while this was an okay movie, it just wasn't the same as watching the Duke as the hero."
5,Spectacular achievement.,"I don't consider this a remake in the true sense as both are based on an amazing novel. I saw an article recently titled ""The Greatest Book You've Never Read"", the fact that the novel was made into a movie so quickly overshadowed it, but it too is a classic. What many reviewers comment on as 'mistakes' by the Coen brothers, are in fact them staying true to the novel. Powerfully in the decision to use narrative the opening scene (as it is in the book). The courtroom scene is lost in the original, it has no real purpose - here it gives us a powerful sense of the time; dark brooding men, dressed in black in a shadowy courtroom. The brutality is historical not gratuitous; life or death was decided here, men were hanged. This eclectic masterpiece will become a classic for bringing the book to life."
1,Hollywood Grit,"Jeff Bridges was really a reason to watch this movie , but the rest ..... A child actor like in a Disney flick , was that necessary ? What a miscast for that kind of story . After a ride on a horse back through a river the actor appeared in bone dry clothing , was that supposed to be funny ? And here's the point , I had the impression that this movie was made to entertain everybody's taste . Like a creature , half chicken , half fish . After a smile , there's only left a laugh and a half ."
1,FUZZY,"I purchased two of this dvd - one for myself, and one as a gift. When I opened mine, the inside of the packaging had fuzz all on the inside, and all over the dvd. I tried wiping it off, however it seemed to get stuck on the back side in the inner ring 'lip'. I haven't played it in my dvd player yet - frankly a bit worried to do so. AND hoping that the one I purchased as a gift does not have this 'fuzz' all in it also!"
1,cant get there from here,it might have been nice to really review this movie if it would play but it wont every other dvd did so whats its problem?
1,True Grit DVD,"This DVD arrived without a case; and it was not viewable. At first I thought it was either dirty or my machine needed cleaning. It was neither of these...it was the DVD. I think it was a bad copy...needless to say, I was very disappointed in this product."
1,True Grit,"Was expecting more from a Coen brother's film. This movie fell flat for me.Two bright lights in the movie were Josh Brolin, cast as Tom Chaney, andBarry Pepper, which I thought was fun touch in that he was cast as Ned Pepper,relative perhaps? I was not expecting a remake, not in the least, but Iwas expecting more in a new story that never captivated me."
3,"Not A Bad Remake, But I'll Stick with The John Wayne Classic.","Just saw True Grit while it was entertaining the new version is lacking that something that made the original great. although jeff bridges did a great job, alot of the performances were flat and uninspired. i really like the coen brothers better as quirky comedy writers and directors then the serious stuff there's trying nowadays. but it was'nt a bad picture, but i'll stick with the john wayne classic. This film is pretty much is just a shot for shot remake of the 1969 Classic acted by different actors with a few tweaks here and there for no real good effect to it. and what's with all the night shots? they seem to like to do those alot and the actress while good was a bit too young for my taste as ms. Ross, a different actress would've been better to play the part.Anyway it's not a bad remake, but it could've been better.It's PG-13 for Strong Violence and Lauguage"
5,Incredible,"I wasn't sure what to make of this movie before I saw it.I knew it was a western and a remake but...The good.Incredible acting,directing,score,cinematography,pacing....heck...pretty much everything about this movie was perfect.I suggest watching the first time with subtitles on as they are speaking an older version of English that is VERY difficult to understand.It was for me anyway lol.The bad?Nothing.And I do mean nothing.I love the ocassional western and this is, not only up there with 3:10 to Yuma but is leagues better.Highest recommendations."
3,Door handle,"It seems like the original design of the Suzki door handle leaves something to be desired. After trying two different replacemnts witch also broke, I made my own out of metal."
4,Very good...,"Year by year AAS become less ""drone-pop"" and more pop! The process had already begun with their previous effort (""know by heart"", also an excellent album) and is brought even further on this release, their latest.Even if the sound retains AAS' trademark elements (for example the breathy vocals everyone familiar with the band we'll recognize...) the album is more varied, drawing at times from rock and even funk!. Don't get me wrong, there are no rock anthems or funky numbers on the album but elements from both genres seep through several tracks.On the whole I found this album extremely good, arguably the best in their career.[...]"
3,Not the best of AAS...,"I've been listening to AAS since the release of 'From Our Living Room to Yours'. For me, that remains their finest album, followed closely by 'The Golden Band' - sparse, exquisitely moving 'drone pop' as another reviewer here has called it. The departure towards what I would deem more conventional, accesible pop is not a good thing in my opinion. Yes I'm the part-pooperMost bands worth their weight in salt become more experimental, avant-garde in their later works - a la the Radiohead model. AAS on the other hand, have become more conventional from what was a unique, rich, restrained and definitive sound. While its still a good album, I'm disappointed. Tracks like Magnificent Seventies, Blue Chaise, and Weather Report herals what might-have-been if AAS had been more confident in their sound..."
3,"Ok, only one great song here but worth the cost","Look, i was fooled by the Windows Media Section where i heard30 sec sound clips that sounded like the rest of this album, (besides the song EMERGE) would be good. It is not really.mostly borring, often too slow, and missing any real development past EMERGE. As for Emerge the song is excellent!, and worth the price of the cd...but don't look much farther; because it's not there.The bonus DVD was a shock, as it holds a ton of information;The mockumentary of Fisherspooner is great!the DVD also includes a bunch of remixes of EMERGE. Most of the remixes are the ususal fare and don't stray too far from the original but at least two of them are excellent counterparts.the DVD is worth more than the CD so get it!"
3,"I love some of the songs, but not all of the songs","When this CD first came out I had a friend who raved about it and would play it almost every Saturday night before going out. I quickly bought the CD (not having heard all the songs) and after listneing to the whole CD I realized that there were really only 4 of 5 songs I loved, and the rest were just okay or I didn't care for. Years later I still enjoy the same songs and skip the others."
4,Well worth it.,"Love this album, especially for it's Wire cover, the 15th.If you like to hear where Fischer & Spooner got their inspiration, you should definitely check out THE best album of 1979, Wire's 154. Electroclash in it's originality."
5,THE NEXT ELECTRONIC WAVE,"Just when the techno-electonica-dance faze has become redundant, along comes Fischerspooner. Then again, to label the band as any of the above would only be jeopardizing, as well as inaccurate. Instead, Fischerspooner recalls a brand of synth-pop not heard in years, reinterpreting some of its finest moments as heard in bands such as Wire, Kraftwerk, Can, etc. Not since Orchestral Manouevres in the Dark's debut album in 1980 has electronic music sounded so sensual and mesmerizing as does with this startling release of Fischerspooner's ""#1."" Sounding a bit like OMD's ""electricity,"" ""the 15th,"" ironically, was written by Wire's Colin Newman. Though ""Turn On"" sounds a bit too much like the latest dance-craze, this album, like the many releases out there, never makes the mistake of repeating itself. This album, at the least, remains rejuvenating and revitalizing!"
2,Painfully overrated.,After all the glowing reviews I thought I couldn't go wrong with this purchase...I was very wrong. There are really only a few tracks here that you will want to listen to again. I'm guessing that the one catchy track(Emerge) on the entire album was good enough for reviewers to say how great this album is when in reality it's overall quite bland. There are a few other tracks that are ok but the majority are a drag to listen to and once the novelty of Emerge wore off I didn't have any interest whatsoever in listening to this album.I strongly advise anyone who isn't sure about buying this album to resist the hype and look for something else. It really isn't that good.
2,Eyes on the Future; Feet Stuck in 1984,"With their debut CD #1, New York's Fischerspooner keep one eye on the future of electronica while their dancing feet are firmly planted in 1984. Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner have taken care of all of the visuals - their video for the club hit ""Emerge"" is a hoot - but the music is often wan and predictable. There are only two actual songs here - the aforementioned ""Emerge"", which is the best one-hit wonder to come down the pike since Frankie said ""Relax""!, and ""The 15th"", which is a superfluous remake of a superior Wire track. The remixes at the end of the disc are great, because they boil Fischerspooner down to beat and blips and place them firmly in clubland where they may not belong but will most certainly end up. The pretenses to performance art are just that: pretenses. Stick them in a room with Laurie Anderson or Karen Finley and, chances are, they won't have the chops of Anderson or the conceptual courage of Finley."
1,yawn,"This CD [stinks]! Okay, the Wire cover is good and they're probably cool to see live. But, intentionally making formulaic, unoriginal, heartless techno music doesn't change the fact that it's formulaic, unoriginal, and heartless.It's a funny joke, but bad music, maybe good for the soundtrack of Blade 3."
2,Music Good -Live show boring!,"Like another review i read ...the music on the cd is decent - not groundbreaking or anything, but catchy enough.I travelled 3 hours to see them live hoping for a great experience and it was soooo boring and annoying. It was a drag show without the great makeup nor the humor. In fact it was overall a disappointment. I feel that maybe they claim great shows to hide the fact that they could never play the music live if it is in fact even them who recorded the music. So not only do they provide an average cd but less than average show! Get with the program FS and get over yourselves."
2,Pure Junk,"Take Sigue Sigue Sputnik and combine with Visage with a dice of parody and a fashion show and you get the music of FischerSpooner...People cannot be serious claiming this has artistic merit, however, it's so left field that it might just shake the status quo of techno music out there so that the rhytum devine left over from the disco era (house music and the various strains thereof with the same drum beat over and over again) might crack under the pressure over this mega-hyped album and group.Yet, I cannot wait to go to a performance to see the spectacle. Wierd. That's why this album deserves two stars thenstead of just one."
1,Hated it!,This was a gift for my 13 month old daughter. From the very beginning I was having problems with it recognizing the books and turning of the pages. The on/off button is the only light and that was distracting to my little girl. She kept turning the toy on and off. I'd hear the song begin to start and then Bye! Bye! over and over. Had to press very hard with the little bee to make it respond. If I had a hard time pushing down with the bee then it was impossible for my little one to get it to work. It's a waste of money and space because it's so big. I have her full attention when I read a book to her myself. Stick with the good old fashion way of learning. I can spend this valuable time with my daughter reading to her myself than trying to make this toy work properly.
2,not working too well,I got a used one and returned it and then I got a new one and it still didn't work as it should. it's too delicate to get the bee to press on each picture. not really suitable for little hands.
1,Doesn't Work and Company is Unwilling to Help,"My 18 month old son received this as a Christmas gift. He was unable to get the bee to press down hard enough to recognize most of the pages in the book. My husband and I had the same issue. My son also could not close the back where the books are stored, so whenever he carried it around, the extra books would fall out. I contacted the company, who says they are unaware of any problems with this toy and did not offer to replace it or look into it further."
2,Buttons hard to push,"Bought this for my 15 month granddaughter- I have to agree with HATE IT! that on/off button is distracting and that pushing the bee on the buttons is extremely hard if more then one page between buttons. Educational,its a sound toy for teaching ABC, Colors and shapes, We will probably use the books more without the toy and let her play with it as a toy- definitely durable. VTech was responsive when I called and stated the toy wouldn't recognize the ABC book. Since I had just purchased it- they are replaceing it free with free shipping. Would I buy it again- NO!! Return it as VTech offered- No, as the books are educational/durable and we can use them without the carrier."
2,Maybe when my son gets older!,"My son received this toy as a birthday gift. It seemed like a great gift but it's not all that great for a child that is facinated with flashing lights. The problem is the on/off button is a flashing light that plays a song. Of course my son is intrigued by this and is constantly shutting the thing on and off so he can see the light and hear the song instead of actually playing with the toy. My husband tried to cover the light with a piece of card board and tape, but by that time my son still knew where to push in order to hear the song. Maybe he'll be able to really get to use it as a learning toy when he gets older. Now its just music machine for him."
1,"Waste of time, money and space!","This ""educational"" toy is a waste! You must use a magic bee to interact with the books. The string that the bee is on is too short to move it around easily. Plus the bee does not always work. It would make MUCH more sense for the kid to press with their own fingers. I'm so sick of these companies advertising ""educational toys."" Please, buy your kids some real books, blocks and stacking cups. Now those are educational!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I agree with all the negative reviews regarding this toy. This toy will not work! The 'bee' only works 10% of the time and already my daughter is totally frustrated with it. The song is so annoying when you start it up and there is no way around it. I thought this toy would be a great alternative to the discontinued Leappad, but it's nowhere near as good and I plan on taking it back ASAP. It's a piece of junk, don't waste your money. Vtech is usually so much better than this!!"
2,Not like his other books.,"I give 4 or 5 stars to the ""The Road Less Travelled"", ""People of the Lie"", and ""The Different Drum"", but after reading 50 pages of fluff, I gave up on this one."
1,Not deep dish!,The pie pan looks nice enough but it is no deeper than any other pie pan that I have.
1,It's too small,"The description is wrong for this product. I thought it was going to be a regular sized pie dish, but deeper. It looks like it would make a ""personal pie"". I think the 6 inches refers to the diameter, not the depth of the pie pan, even though the description says it is 10 inches."
2,glazes flawed,"I ordered two of these pie dishes as a gift. I received them from Mega China. They were definitely seconds. The glazes on both were flawed and there were noticeable ""bumps"" in the glaze covering the interior of the dish. One at the very center of the dish, and one where the sloping side meets the bottom of the dish. These pie dishes were not designated as seconds. This does not mean that they aren't usable, and the shipping was incredibly fast, but they definitely should have included a warning that they were seconds and that enabled the discounted price."
2,Not a deep dish,Basically the same as a regular 10 inch pyrex pie plate. Description says 2.5 inch but actual measurement is 2.0 inch outside height. Inside depth is only 1.25 inch. Inside diameter is 9.5 inches. Nice color and good quality but looking for a true deep dish. It's going back.
5,Perfect after a fatigue-filled menopause,"Since I am on the other side of a fatigue-filled menopause, I am now in horrible physical condition and find this DVD perfect for someone in my condition. Every single muscle in my body aches. I have tried all sorts of different yoga DVDs and find them too difficult (at this time) for me. I think it's a good place for me to start.I also have to say that I don't find them talking to me like I am stupid. I think they are talking to those who have not had much experience with yoga, pilates, and exercise in general, and, last buy not least, the elderly.The worst thing I can say about this is that that in order to miss all the talk, I have to FF to the right spot. I miss the old VHS tapes, where you could turn it off and start right at the place you want. If there is a way to do this with a DVD, I would love to know."
2,I'm so very disappointed!,"This is absolutely the most annoying exercise video I have ever viewed.Too much talk! I just couldn't get pass the chatter. The narrator is condescending lecturing as if talking to 5 or 6 year old children. The constant babble is a turn off when one is trying to exercise. I kept watching, and hoping but by the time I reached segment 6 I was fed up! I hit mute! Without the chatter the video might be somewhat useful -- don't know.Chattr aside -- keeping fit in your 50s is a very very basic intro to body-sculpting. If you have never exercised it might be for you. If you want a good work-out video this video is not for you."
2,Watched once,"Between full time job and housework, I don't know.I get really motivated for about a week and thenI'm tired and don't want to get up early to watch itand exercise. Sleep is more important to me.Guess thats why I'm not fit in my 50's."
1,Not very practical,Clear plastic pipe would have worked better. It just has plastic feet glued to the bottom. The glue must have air bubbles in it because the pipe turns upside down. Feet float to the top.
4,Wisdom through comedy,"How many times have we read a book, or seen a movie where the unlikely hero is a buffoon. Their stumbling and backwards approach seems to put the more competant characters to shame , and shows a ""wisdom"" they don't have. This book analyzes that phenomena."
1,Sounded Great When it Worked,I owned a Harman AVR 500 for years. Great receiver. Sounded good no problems. I still have it hooked up in our bedroom. Upgraded to the AVR 630 for the 7 channels. After 13 months no sound. Took to authorized repair shop. 50 dollars to look at. Was told unit could not be repaired. Called Harman & they replaced for free minus 60 dollars shipping. Nine months later AVR 630 won't stay on for more than 10 seconds. No HDMI connections. No more Harman. Looking for new receiver now.
3,pretty Good,"I dug r. kelly's ""Tempo slow""&also the track he wrote for the Isley Brother's ""Let's lay together"".which has a strong O'jays vibe going on there. but I gotta say Joe's ""What Your Man won't do"" stole the Soundtrack.that is still a on point track."
1,Danger: will not release pressure!,"I had this on my 1996 Toyota Avalon and my lower radiator hose blew off. I contacted Stant and they sent me a new one which before I used it I tested it's release pressure with a hand pump and it did not release even at 30 psi. I hate to bad mouth a well known company but I will just use Autozone brand, at least they test right with my pump."
5,Good replacement,Had to go to amazon.com to get this part when we were told by local dealers and auto parts store they would have to special order. It was needed fairly quickly and amazon came through. Part fit perfectly.
4,Great book for the diver and non-diver alike.,"A collection of true, short stories related to the world of scuba diving from the best of the best. The stories told here make divers want to put on their gear and go diving. The same stories inspire non-divers to learn the sport. An easy read, this is a good companion book to take along on the subway or plane when reading time is limited, or as the title suggests, to curl up with in front of a fire on dreary winter's night.As the editor of DivesafeandOften.com, I see many scuba related books come across my desk; however, this is one of the more outstanding. It is not an instructional book but rather a look at the magical underwater world and the creatures who dwell therein which are accessible only to scuba divers."
2,"Wow, what writing","Wow....the writing in this book is truly awful. I haven't actually quit reading a book, especially one about diving, which is one of my passions in years, but I quit this one about halfway through. The writing is terrible. The stories I read all sounded like ""what I did over summer vacation"" stories written by 8th graders. I finally had to quit."
3,Detailed Explanation for Pilates Newbies,"Ana Caban thoroughly explains the correct posture, breathing techniques, form and mental approach to Pilates. She then goes through a short beginning Pilates workout, offering modifications for those beginners who are not yet ready for the full exercise.This is not a video you would want to use over and over again. I'm glad I rented it (from Netflix). I used it three times and returned it and will move on to other Pilates workouts. This video did provide a good foundation for me before moving on to others."
3,Okay,ALOT of terminology not enough actual excersise. I hardly felt my heart rate but I learned pilots language. They need to add 15 more minutes of actual motion.
2,it's not beginner enough,"It's beginner II. True I didn't see the ""II"" until it came. However, I've done Yoga and in my opinion it's not beginner.If you are male, this one is not apppropriate.There are no physical examples of modified poses. If you are fairly flexible already, for example if it's not strain at all to sit straigth up--all the way on sit bones, with legs straight out (and do some stretching from there) then this is ok for you. If not, get something else. I couldn't find anything however."
5,A must read for anyone currently or planning to raise a child!,"As a former accountant, I prefer hard numbers to mere opinions. This was exactly the book I needed to read when I was debating whether to continue working or start staying at home with my children. I suggest it to my friends, family, even strangers because the information is so well presented. Some of us may not be able to replace the years we had our children in day-care, but we can move forward with the valuable information provided in this book. Sure, it requires some sacrifices when you depend on one income to raise a family, but isn't the outcome of your children more important than the size of your apartment/home, etc."
5,Day Care Deception -Wonderful,"Very informtive, Great information- Lots of great points made. Great Aurthor!!"
4,Not too bad,The yard cart is a good investment but is slightly unweidly to push. If your load is light it is really handy especially if you need to lift it to a trash can.
1,Allsop cart review,The package arrived in a box that appears to have been used several times previously. There were no small parts or instructions. They obviously fell out of the box either at the factory in transit. I doubt that UPS could do as much damage to the box that I observed.
1,Box was ripped open during delivery and all the small parts were missing,The box arrived with one of the corners was ripped open. All the small parts were gone. I read similar complaints from other reviews. I returned it and I got a replacement. Surprisingly the second delivery also had same problem even though it was to a lesser degree. Simply amazing! I could improvise the missing parts since they were not very critical but it should have never happened.
3,"company is stupid, cool product...","Amazon shipped at the speed of light. Box arrived shredded, missing essential parts. Amazon is shipping a new one to me, and telling the company to get smarter. I liked what I saw before I retuned the bad one. ,( second box in bad shape, but all parts in box)I am 5'4 and have a bad back, if you are taller, buy the bigger one,,, I debated. Maybe this will hold fifty lbs?.If you have a problem, just tell amazon and they fix it at the speed of light. I liked what I saw for my garden needs. Amazon promised to tell company to get it togther,, who would annoy amazon? buy with confidence.Three days later.. I used this to move/clean out my little chicken coop, it handles 25 -35 lbs fine. the handle pins sometimes fall out. If you are taller than 5'4, get the bigeer cart, the angle to the ground becomes a problem.It is a nice item, I will get my 40$ of wear out of it this year."
2,Poor manufacturing detracts from what could be a useful product,"No one will ever mix up Chinese engineering with German, but you get what you pay for. Original parts sent did not fit -- wasted much time trying to get bolt through a hole. Complained and received another set of parts, which fit but required the necessity of hammering pins through their associated holes -- which I don't think was intended! There was simply no other way to make it work. Good idea ruined by poor engineering, design and ""craftsmanship."""
1,ALL THE PARTS MISSING,"Just opened it after buying it in September. Main pieces there, but no axle, screws, bolts, etc. Too late to return, so I'm screwed out of $50."
1,BAD Inflatable Tire: This version of this cart is a waste of money,"This would be a great product if the wheel were not inflatable, if it were just a hard wheel. As it is, it's VERY difficult to inflate the tire because the valve is hard to get to. Then, the tube just split wide open (it seemed pretty dry and crackly) within a couple months of use. Now, am I supposed to go buy a replacement tube for this little tire? What a drag. Even getting the tube out to see how bad the hole in it was: a big pain! - not nearly as easy as changing the tube in a bike tire. I would not recommend this version of this cart to anyone, I would get one that does not have a tube and tire system that needs to be filled with air and replaced. - Oh, and part of the plastic on one side of the assembly that holds the tire broke within days. It still worked, so I was able to use it anyway, but just another drag..."
3,Wheelbarrow,"Assembling the wheelbarrow was problematic. The pins didn't fit the pre-cut holes. When I tried to force the pins (used to hold the handls in place) through the plastic wheel holder, the plastic broke."

1,like red on a rose by Alan Jackson,"This had to be the most depressing, slow singing cd I've ever heard by Alan Jackson. There isn't even a quick song on the whole recording to pep things up. It's a chore to listen and brings my spirits down. It's as if he recorded this cd in a very low point of his life. Very disappointing. I'll definitely be checking the recordings before I purchase blindly again, which was never an issue with his music before."
4,Great CD,"I'm not a big Alan fan but really enjoyed this disk. The ""bluesy"" style is extremely enjoyable and the only reason I only give it four stars is because all my favorite songs are at the fron of the disk, I really don't much care for the last two. It is not his usual style but if you want an artist to do everything alike, you would only buy one CD because then you would have everything there is on that particular artist."
3,Like Red on a Rose,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this CD, and I am a big Alan Jackson fan. It, for me, did not live up to his other music."
2,Mediocre,Geat fan of Alan Jackson. I have ALL his albums to date...but disappointed with this one. Too many slow songs.
2,Murder on music row,"A few years ago, Alan Jackson was singing ""someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul""... Today, he is that someone... Or maybe Alison Krauss is the one to blame? Anyway, as a huge AJ fan, I am sad to admit that this album is boring and disappointing. It is desperately lacking the catchy tunes, fiddle and steel guitar that make his style. Where is the country music in this CD? I really hope AJ's next album will be better than this one."
4,Imagine my shock...,"I walk into work this morning to hear someone singing the John Doe rarity ""Imitation Of The Blues"". This track was only released on a promo-only disc some 15 years ago and I'm getting a version I've never heard. (for folks who don't know who John Doe is... he's destined for Rock-N-Roll Hall Of Fame with his classic LA punk band ""X"" and I suppose is best known in this crowd as ""Earl"" from Pure Country).Anyway, this is the first Alan Jackson album I could stand. His music always seemed overly refined to fit the pop-country charts. Top40 ""Country"" ain't my bag.This album surpases typical Nashville dreck and if that's what you need, skip it. Otherwise simply listen to the samples and make up your own mind.For the haters out there who seem to claim ""ownership"" of Alan Jackson's sound I quote the classic OC punk outfit ""Agent Orange"":""The public gets what they deserve not what they demandUnless we all decide to be a business not a band""I applaud Alan Jackson for making this album!"
1,Terrible,"This CD sucks. I don't know any nicer way of saying it. It just flat out sucks! This is NOT the Alan Jackson that I love to listen to. The songs on here sound like crap. They don't even sound country. The ONLY decent song on this CD is ""A Woman's Love"". But there is another version of that song,that he originally released on his 1998 album,""High Mileage"",that sounds so much better than this version on here. I don't know why he even felt that he had to re-record it. The ""High Mileage"" version is so much better and actually sounds like country. As for the rest of this album...it doesn't even deserve a 1,but a HUGE FAT ZERO! Overall,if you're a big Alan Jackson fan like me,then don't be expecting that great country sound from this crappy CD. I STRONGLY recommend you leave this one alone."
3,Why not dance with the one you came with?,"I'm very disappointed. I tried very hard to enjoy this CD, but my heart's not in it. Alan Jackson is way too good to waste his time on bland uninspiring material like this."
3,like red in a rose,its a great cd but the first track is scratch so it does not play. but other than that it is a great cd.
2,Not Alan Jackson,"It has only one or two good songs on it. I know he wanted to try something new but he needs to stick with true country music. Like his lastest cd ""Good Times'"""
2,very disappointing,"I should've listened to cuts from this cd before buying it at the store,but I've always liked Alan's songs, so I figured this would be a good cd also, like many of his others.Sorry to say, but, I'm very disappointed with this one.It is a very bluesey and slow moving bunch of songs, none of which were really that good at all.It would be easy to pass this one up, if I had heard some sample cuts.To me, this is not the Alan Jackson that I expected."
2,Could be better,I love Alan Jackson But this cd was not nearly as good as any of the past ones he has brought out. I was very disappointed with this one. It just did not do anything for me. All the songs sound too much the same.
5,Great Mello Country Album,"This is by far my favorite album of 2006. It is subtle album, but that just means it needs to resonate in you for a while. Listen to it quitely and you will appreciate its mood."
5,Alan Jackson.,"Alan Jackson, Mr smooth he has the best voice & beautiful love songs, you'll just want to listen to over and over again. If you buy this album then it's money well spent. Buy it and enjoy."
1,Doesn't work with his voice,Alan's voice doesn't really work with this style of music. I miss him singing COUNTRY music. This just doesn't suit his voice!
1,"Alan, What happened?","I am a HUGE Alan Jackson fan, I have every one of his albums, some of them multiple copies. What happened on this tragedy??? No Seel, No Fiddle, No Country. I hope Alan hasn't sold out."
2,Where's my Alan???,"Wow...was I ever shocked when I poped this CD in my car as soon as I came out of the store. My husband and I just looked at each other and said""what is this?"" We could not believe how s l o w the songs were. Way too slow to the point of being draby. The soulful sound of Alan's was a little too soft. Most of the songs sounded almost the same. I am so dissappointed in this one. He is the only true country singer, no bells and whistles, just Alan, which is the greatest. He as a person cannot be compared with anyone in Country Music. If he is planning on making a switch over, he needs to put a little more into it. He can do it, not this time though."
4,Too much of a good thing...,"Love Alan Jackson singing anything, love most of these songs, love the fact that Alan isn't afraid to branch out and try something new. I don't feel that everyone has to stay in the niche that they're so good at and I feel he is a success with these songs and appreciate this diversion.However, like many of the reviews below, this CD was too much of a good thing. It needed to be broken up with at least one or two different tempo songs. They were all good, but they are all very slow and sultry and they all ran together and after listening twice, I still can't distinguish one from the other except for one or two of them. ""Had It Not Been You"" is exquisite, had me teary, and is worth the price of the CD alone.Still, the man and his voice are a marvel and this CD is a must have! Just make a mix and break these songs up. I doubt he's done with his traditional country sound and I look forward to more of that and will just enjoy this CD in the meanwhile."
2,Not Alan Jackson's Country Style Music. More Pop,I have always been an Alan Jackson fan. He is country like George Jones and George Strait. I never thought he would make a pop record. No upbeat Honky Tonk songs. Maybe his next will be Alan again. His loyal fans will be waiting. Maybe he needs someone to produce his next one beside Alison Krauss. I'm a big fan of her music also. It's just not a good mix with Alan.
3,interesting,"this is a little different alan jackson. alison krauss is involved so there are a lot of beautiful songs, but its just different. my husband doesnt like it cuz he says its nothing like alan's music. so if you like alison krauss give it a try. if you are a diehard classic alan fan, it might not be your favorite."
2,Disappointing,"This is Alan Jackson meets Frank Sinatra. Don't buy this just because you like Alan Jackson. Other than ""Red Like A Rose"", there is nothing on here that I ever care to hear again."
4,Listen once...put it down...then listen again,"Okay...like a lot of posters here I was at first disappointed with the results of this CD. Being a huge AJ fan, I bought the CD the day it came out and couldn't wait to hear what else he had to offer - especially since the title cut was literally playing in my head day and night. I figured that maybe he asked Alison Krauss to produce the one song and then the rest of the CD would be usual AJ fare.I listened to it one time through and thought...what the @#&%?!I put it down a few days and put it back on my CD player. I feel much better about it now than I did a few days ago. It is a departure of sorts for Alan...not what one would expect. However, I believe this album will bring him some critical acclaim from those who normally don't listen to his usually ""Gone Country-esque"" style. It's pure...it's simple and sometimes understated. But isn't that AJ?"
2,You'll find it boring,"I like most of Alan Jackson's albums and so I was quite surprised when I got this one. It's a departure from his regular music. I found myself skipping through most of the songs looking for one that had a catchy tune. These songs are long and drawn out and are missing that catchy, sing-a-along quality. I applaud his decision to expand himself into other musical directions but he should do so in moderation with perhaps one or two different songs per album. On the positive side, his voice is top notch and the recording is crystal clear."
2,Harald from Austria,"I bought this cd, because i have every cd from Alan. Alan is a very good songwriter and an excellent Countrysinger and here is the problem. This is no countrymusic at all. Alan sounds very tired. I think he should take a break of 2 years and than he will be back with a real fresh COUNTRY cd.Allison Kraus as producer isn`t good for Alan. Alan should look at George Strait, how real good countrymusic should sound.Alan`s voice doesn`t work with this style of music at all."
2,"I Admire Taking Chances, But . . .","Prior to Like Red on a Rose, my feeling was that Alan Jackson was money. Anything he put out I knew would be good, and I did not ever feel I had to hear the tracks before buying his CDs. But that's all changed with this release. Alan Jackson is an undeniable talent, and this CD is very well crafted. His voice is as strong as ever, but this is not a typical Alan Jackson CD. It is almost like an entirely new genre: a more sophisticated, adult contemporary sound with definite Country overtones--I don't know how to describe it, but the songs are not as fun as the tracks on previous records. In time, I might grow used to this and perhaps even come to like it, but for now, there is not really anything on this CD that I feel compelled to add to my playlist. He does not sound like he is having a good time singing these songs, and I am not having a good time listening. Perhaps he was aiming to create a CD to be appreciated far more than enjoyed."
5,"Okay, it's not your typical honky tonk album . . .","But don't give up on it because it's different. The first time I heard ""Like Red on a Rose"" I almost had to pull my car over and stop driving. It's was a startling experience that left me with goosebumps! I love the country side of Alan Jackson, but any singer who can can reach an audience that deeply deserves our support. Kudos also to Allison Krause."
5,Depths and shading,"Really enjoyed this new album. Has a lot of depth and kind of a smoky, melancholy richness to it. Reveals more of Alan Jackson's full talents."
5,Alan Jackson / Allison Kraus 'NUFF SAID,"Please don't pick up this album expecting normal A.J. fare. It's not.This is one of the most elegant and lovely CD's in recent years. Most tracks are smooth, sensual and loving. A few sound a bit more country-traditional (twangy, if you will) and may appease those who would call this album more pop than Country Western. Don't be a stick-in-the-mud. This CD reflects a talented, well-rounded performer and musician who has been encouraged/enabled to spread his wings with the nurturing passion of another talented, well-rounded artist, Allison Kraus, as producer. This is a marriage made in Music Heaven. What GORGEOUS work. I can't stop playing this C.D. Alan's wonderful voice is on full display here. He sounds comfortable in this format. I am beyond impressed. God Bless America!"
4,its not the normal,"Its not the normal for sure, but it is new. My favrote song on this CD is the title Track. i am defenetly going to do what one of the previous reviewers said and make a playlist (with all of his other cd's) then it might contain a better listing expericene. (My favrote AJ song of all time was Living On Love) AJ we miss the normal you please come back."
3,One song wonder,"The title song alone is worth the price of the cd. I first heard Alan perform Like Red On A Rose on the Oprah Winfrey show and loved it. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for the rest of the songs. I prefer the kind of music that you can sing along with. Some of the melodies were difficult to listen to. Don't Change On Me and Good Imitation Of The Blues were O.K but for the most part, I just skip to #3."
4,loke red on a rose.,"different from other Alan Jackson albums. it is good, he's got sentimental and the numbers are thought provoking."
3,Good but slow,"There are some good songs on this album, some blues, some country and one oldies sounding, but they are all slow songs and all love songs. Better to download you favorites as listening to the whole album becomes tedious."
5,a different class indeed...,this album is something that i must say is amazing. its full of intersting noises and thoughts on life. yes common people has to be the greatest working class anthem ever. jarvis cocker writes tales of british life throught the eyes of a jaded being who wants to hope so much. theres a lot to love here disco 2000 is a catchy as hell affair and of course common people will leave you rollicking. jarvis affected the squeeky sunth pop noises when he was doing earlier albums and it all comes to a head here where everything seems unique. i like this record...you better like it
4,music for everyone...not just the Common People,"If you were to look at my other reviews, you would notice that I have written on a variety of different styles of music. I say this because I truly only write about music that I completely enjoy, and Pulp's Different Class is no exception. Drawn to this band by the popish Common People, I was excited to find out that the rest of the album was as impressive. I am not the type to give into catchy lyrics and hooks, but well crafted ones, evident throughout this album, are welcome every now and then. I find myself grabbing for this album on the commute to and from work, and it is a great release from everyday hassles. Disco 2000 and Something Changed are great additions to this album. Put in Different Class, turn the volume up, let your voice free, and sing along with great Brit pop."
4,Pulp,This is a quirky intelligent funky euro club album that is listenable and keeps your attention from the first note until it ends leaving you wanting to repeat it.
5,The one album I will always own.,"It was about 5:30am and I was channel surfing and came across the video for ""Common People"" playing on MTV. I had never heard of Pulp before (thank you San Antonio Radio) but I had to have that song. I bought this album that same day and still listen to it at least once a week. The whole album is a great listen start to finish."
5,"Uniquely sly, catchy, clever and British","If aliens came to this planet and wanted to find out what a British person is like, Jarvis Cocker would be the perfect example. His sarcastic lyrics and sly observations on British life and the class divide (""My favourite parks are car parks, grass is soemthing you smoke, birds are something you shag""), plus his panache and unusual style mark him out as a cult star.His knack for a classic pop song was ably demonstrated here too. Disco 2000 and Common People are great examples of this, both guaranteed to get you singing along whilst also having lyrical depth. Another favourite of mine is the dark and mischievous I-Spy, in which the aforementioned lyric is but one highlight. Check this album out now."
4,Classic and cheerfully britpop music.,"As a person who live in Israel and want to live in England one day, the CD sleeve was a reminder to England's beautiful urban landscape. As for the music, well... that Jarvis Cocker is one of England's great composers of all time, right after Radiohead's Thom Yorke. Every track on the album is like a true story that happened to someone in his life (in this case, appereantly Cocker),and the whispers in the songs are so stylish and beautiful. Though, they're no instrumental parts in the album (except, maybe, the intros of ""Disco 2000"" and ""Common People"") but that's okay- the album is fantastic."
1,Liars,"I was supposed to be sent two NEW UK-US adapters. The adapters I got were very clearly used, and used heavily. They're scratched, scuffed, melted, marked, and one even has a crack right down the middle. Absolute trash."
1,Didn't work for us,"I was so hopeful that this unit would help control our growing problem with mice. They love climbing on our counter so we put humane mouse traps in their path. I plugged the PestContro unit in the wall right above the path they take to get on my counter and one unit on the other floor in my house. I have since caught about five mice (in 9 days) that walked right under the PestContro unit into the traps. The ""sound"" doesn't seem to bother them at all. Needless to say, I will be returning the PestContro units I purchased. In my opinion, this is just an over-priced piece of plastic.Now, the Smart Mouse humane mouse traps are a really great find. If you want to get control of a mouse problem, these traps are a great thing, and are sold on Amazon."
1,'Pest' Control,"Maybe it works on rats, but I had purchased it for cockroaches.They're still here running around underneath the thing, so, save your money and get boric acid."
2,pestcontro dual technology,bought this because i always have crickets going off in my walls and stuff. this says its supposed to be good for up to 2000 sq. feet. my house is only 1700 sq. feet and it doesn't work. maybe it works a little bit (or it's just wishful thinking on my part because i spent like 30 bucks on this)it seems not as bad with the cricket situation but the crickets are'nt gone. i probably wouldnt reccomend buying this unless you have one for every plug in your house. your best bet is to call an exterminator or go buy your own bug spray and do it yourself.
3,"Good book, but not what I was searching for","It is a little too much, to high end for me, I was looking for more ""down to earth"" receipes, that the Mediterranean folks eat in their homes. This is high end eating out stuff. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift this year."
1,EXPECTED A MUCH BETTER QUALITY RECORDING FROM B.B.,"I was excited to see this title and quickly ordered it. I thought I would get a typical B.B. King quality recording except one which was faith-based. Man, was I disappointed.I always wondered how B.B. could record so many albums that are not faith-based when he is a professing Chrisitian. I assumed that he gave it a good shot with this release and didn't make any money off, so he didn't try again. What appears to have happened with this one is that it was recorded many years ago (I heard circa 1960), but unlike Little Richard's Gospel recordings from 1959 to 1964, B.B.'s are substandard.B.B.'s Gospel Blues is scartchy, very rough and lacks almost all of the great things that I expected. I hope and pray that he does something of quality for the Lord before he passes from this world."
2,The most obvious thing is still missing...,The most obvious problem was not addressed: cannot do multiplayer campaigns. Why would this not be included in the game? It takes away a ton of potential fun.
3,"Great game, new features, but more problems with cities","Like Rome Totalwar the look and feel of the Barbarian Invasion addition is great. There are a number of nice new features, (Hordes can be fun) but one old problem has been made worse. Any one who has played Rome knows that large cities especially non Roman ones can be very difficult to manage. Now with religion added in it is even harder. The cities are even larger and many of the barbarians still do not get adequate sewage and road options. There are too many things to build, and it takes to long to build them. Building time scale is unrealistic. There is also no map included with the game, and the one from Rome does not work.It is still a nice addition and I'm glad I bought it. If you liked Rome you will love this on too, even if it is a little frustrating at times."
4,...what you say about my momma...,"...funny, but they try to hard. And then its not so funny and you just want to pull out a 40 oz. and slam it down, and then it gets funny again.. much better to watch with a buzz...."
5,"Wheres the region 2, or PAL VHS????","Oh waht a faulous film, i only wish i could watvh it for a second time; ut alas i live in the good 'ol United kingdom and cannot get a PAL VHS, Or even a Region one Dvd.(i don't have a DVD player, ut would buy one for this DVD!!!!)Oh how i want a copy of this film!!!ah well I'll film my own remake; and watch that."
4,"A MUST SEE, WHEN YOU ARE MESSED UP111111111","YHIS MOVIE IS WHAT THEY INTENDED IT TO BE, A PARODY, JUST LIKE SCARY MOVIE AND SCARYMOVIE TWO, WHICH THIS WAS THEIR ""BABY"", AS EVERTHING ELSE IN LIFE YOU DO ""MATURE"", SO I THOUGHT IT DID IT'S JOB. DID NOT THE OTHERS FOLLOWING MAKE IT IN COMMERCIALIZATION? HOW MANY ADS DO YOU SEE ON TELEVISION OF BLACK MADE MOVIES, GOING TO THE CINEMA ON SCHEDULED DATES? THINK ABOUT IT? THE MONEY SPEAKS FOR ITSELF............"
3,It is funny,"This movie is great. All of my friends and I love it, especially for it's humor. It has great humor. It's funny, I have watched it at least en times, and I doesn't really get boring. Sometimes you feel that it is childish, but I believe that nobody should not see this movie. No matter who you are, give it a chance and watch it at least once."
2,funny but stupid,that's all i have to say about this movie.it didnt even have a plot either.sont waste your time on this movie
2,Without style and a bit disturbing.,"Don't get me wrong there are a few funny moments (like the guy getting JUMPED into Toothpicks gang) but the rest is boring. And in some places disturbing. Like when Legs fantasizes about being MC HAMMER. Now that is scary! Not because MC HAMMER is long since gone but because it looks like it should be in the movie FREAKS due to its sheer ugliness.The direction is very basic and pedestrian. There is no real plot and the structure of the film is so badly put together that 88 minutes feels like 188. It's a bad problem that might cause you to just stop the movie halfway thru.It wants to be in the same league as Airplane but I'm afraid that this movie is stuck down there with Surf Ninjas and Problem Child. Catch it only on TV.The DVD is in bland, bland Dolby 2.0 surround and is letterboxed at 1.85:1."
1,It really deseves 0 stars,"This is such a waste of film. No one involved in this movie should have been paid. I was 13 when I first saw, or I should say tried to sit through this mess. It was just dumb, tasteless, and a shame of a mess for black people and actors. Wow! Wow! real crap. These boys ain't funny their other brothers are."
1,etuboldon,"Dull, crass, insipid and tasteless; raunchy scenes and crude language try to make up for a poor script."
4,haha,Awesome movie awesome copy forgot how much I liked it was great and came within specified times nice work cheers!
5,too good,yeh its full of cliches and the jokes are so predictable but it still will have you creasing cos it is one of those films that will make you laugh non-stop. if you liked boyz in da hood etc then you definately will appreciate this film...i had my doubts but its stupidly funny and great for when you dont wana have to use your brain to follow a story line cos the story is a rip off and a fantastic one i couldnt control myself how much it made me laugh. i love the wayans brothers and they even get a dig at their own mama in the script. i dont care what the other review up there says about it being a turkey or whatever its damn funny and i know that theres a lot of people out there who think the same and if you havent seen it i can guarantee it will make you laugh big time.
2,Poor delivery but disc works,"Im not sure if maybe the mailman stepped on it or Jay Leno thought it was a grilled cheese and chewed it all up, but the dvd case was broken into peices that flew out of the envalope when i opened it.. The disc worked and the cover art was in good shape but the case was shattered which made me feel sad. Hopefully no one ese has this problem, and if you do, come on over and ill make us some lasagna. Or maybe Panda Express, Im feelin Panda Express."
5,laughed my ball sack off,"this was the funniest movie EVER! I watched it 4 times in a row, it didn't get old! Just buy it and watch it, please? I recremond it to anyone who won't get offended of the hood, african american, and watever else. Like I said, BEST MOVIE EVER!!"
5,Dont be a menace to S.C.W.D.Y.J.I.T.H.,"Quality was good, always wanted to add this movie to my collection. Very funny Flick. the wayans do it again."
5,great movie,"completely ignore that assinine review by rachelle o' gorma, seriously what was amazon thinking when they allowed her to review a great movie like this? go cry in your cheerios rachelle, and for once create some sense of humor, it doesn't help if you watch ya-ya sisterhood 24/7 either.also ignore that crappy review by A.R. Howell too, he doesn't know his arse from his elbow.This movie is worth getting, it is funny as all hell.:D"
5,Don't be a Menance to South Central While Drinking your Juice in The Hood-Hillarious and Stupid.,"This is a Stupid Funny type film, A Parody of all the Urban/Street Films that were coming out in the 90's: Boyz n Da Hood,South Central,Jason's Lyric, etcera. The Wayans Are Hilarious! Cameo by Keenan,Starring Marlon & Shawn, Cameo by Kim.Cameo By Bernie Mac."
5,The Message,"If u want 2 laugh ure arse off then buy this! Grandmas that smoke out and breakdance, rude bedtime stories and some of the best lines that i have heard in a film. i just wish it was on sail in the UK"
2,Average!,"I got the Message's& Play on Words.but the Wayans Never Rise On Film Like they seem to on T.V.In Living Color had some Issues but overall it was Original.but nobody from the Family has been able to Bring that kind of Energy To Film.I Liked The Spoofs on the different Films also The Take on O.J,Michael Jackson&2pac.Keenen did a Good Job here.I Think The Family is Talented but I Would Like Too See that side more than Half-Hearted Attempts at 2nd tier Spoofs."
5,This Movie Is Hilarious,"With this comedy, even the title is hilarious! This is a spoof of many movies rolled into one. It has a lot of funny and unique characters. Get ready for lots of belly laughs for this one!"
4,Good Item,"The delivery was very quick, quicker than what i thought it was going to be. The item is exactly as described. Great buy."
3,Had It's Moments,"""Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice In the Hood"" is a funny spoof of all the inner city ""hood"" films of the 90s. Shawn and Marlon Wayans star in the film as Ashtray and Loc Dog. Ashtray has just returned to the ""hood"" in order to live with his father and become a ""man"". We soon find out that Ashtray is actually a couple years older than his father - I'm still confused about that.Overall the film spoofs just about every ""hood"" film of the 90s from Boys 'N the Hood to Poetic Justice. It does have its funny moments that will really have you laughing, but then there are times when it seems like the Wayans brothers are trying a little too hard to get laughs (e.g. the grandmother who swears, smokes weed, and gets in fights for the fun of it gets old after a while). I would suggest this film if you're in the mood for a spoof comedy."
2,Just wasn't good in my opinion.,"Overall just wasn't a good film to me. I watched this years ago, but couldn't remember much about it. I didn't find the acting to be very believable at all by either Wayans brother. There was a laugh here and there, but not enough to cover up the bad acting and raunchiness of the film. Double dutch scene was probably the funniest.Lol I though it was almost like making fun or a mockery of the ""hood"" life though. Just not a fan of films like this. Depending on your taste in movies you could either find this very hilarious or just a total joke. I won't say that it is the worst, but I definitely won't be adding it to my dvd collection."
5,!t was a gift 4 my husband!,My husband loves this movie and always wanted the dvd so I surprised him with it 4 his bday. Its hilarious n the Wayans brothers r great!
4,DON'T BE A MENACE,"DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD is a comic spoof on African-American movies such as ""Boyz In The Hood,"" ""Poetic Justice,"" ""Higher Learning,"" and many others. The movie was written by and stars Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans. The film is about a young man named Ashtray who is dropped off in the ghetto to live with his father and from there he gets into many crazy situations with his best friend Loc Dog. I'm tired of people who bash this movie, it's not a movie meant to be taken seriously, it's a movie that was made for pure entertainment. The Wayans Brothers have never really made a bad movie because they always manage to pack enough laughs to hold my attention into there films."
1,Retards,Wu-Tang_Assassin is patently an idiot. I also assume that the person purporting to be A Kid's Review wrote his review as some sort of a joke. Punctuation must be something that just happens to other people
5,Funny movie,"The Wayans brothers are hands down the funniest family in show business. This movie basicly showcases the comedic talent that they possess. Just buy it and see. Don't rent it, BUY IT. It is that funny."
3,Take it for what it is,"DBAMTSSWDYJITH (long title!) is one of the movies that you cannot expect too much going into. I personally liked it, I thought it spoofed other movies very well (like Boyz N Da Hood) and is just a slap stick kind of romp through a series of racial/sexual jokes. A good rental at least, and I am sure you could find it in the bargin bin for less than ten dollars."
5,THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!!,This movie was the best movie I had ever seen.....it was soooooo funny!! You people have to watch it!! WARNING: Some people won't understand it.....but if you do you'll LOVE IT!!
5,The BEST Moive I have ever seen in my life!,"Hey yo, this is the best flick I've ever seen. The party where everyones naked, the grandmother who smokes weed and blows things up, and the guy with the a-bomb makes this the ultimate in movie making. God bless the makers of this movie and I am buying it as soon as i can."
5,A great comedy movie great for the whole family.,Marlon Wayans showed off his funny skills in the movie. As well as the other actors the movie wouldn't have been anything without them. I think this movie is great for anyone who just wants to sit back and laugh.
5,It was one of the funniest movies ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Shawn and Marlon have lots of talent. They know how to make people laugh. I think it's a natural talent. The movie was great!!!
1,Echo Bridge Home Entertainment?,"I must say.....upon viewing this dvd ""Echo Bridge Home Entertainment""put together, they did a bad job putting it together. First off the main credits don't even fit the screen. looks like a movie file that was edited on windows movie maker, with only play movie and chapter selection on main menu. When the descriptions came up at the end on each person.. the subtitles were way off the screen. Echo Bridge Home Entertainment needs to review the dvd's they put together before releasing it!!!!"
5,funniest movie ever,if you have seen this movie and didnt like it you just might be dead.if you havent seen it....WHY!
5,Hilarious!,We laughed hysterically at this movie. The blacks making fun of their own kind made it so funny. It's nice to have it in our library to watch when we've had a rough day at work & want to laugh for a change. We can watch it over & over & still laugh. I recommend it for everyone's psyche.
3,Silly As Silly Gets,"This movie is for those who enjoy slapstick or have a real silly side. If you don't have that urban sense of humor, you probably won't like this movie."
3,Decent,"Although this movie was void of a storyline, I thought that most of the jokes were pretty funny, like the guy hijacking the old lady's walker. As funny as it was, the absence of a plot makes this a movie that I would only recommend for some quick laughs."
3,I feel sorry for your mother........,This movie is hilarious. But in order to understand most of the parts you have to see Menace II Society.
2,You get what you pay for...,This compass did not work well from the outset. Next time I will just pay the extra money to buy a Brunton instead.
4,great read!,"I don't understand why this book is so inexpensive. Lafontaine's stories are just as good as his later books, and the information he shares catches fish. You will see a lot of seminal ideas in this book that he deals with in greater depth in his later works. A good book, and the price makes it a steal."
3,"Bought this CD for ""It's All You""","And ""It's All You"" is pretty much all I listen to. The first three songs in the beginning of the album are pretty decent, but the majority of the album is a little too soft for my liking. Rachel has a very pretty voice and very sugary sounding. It is probably too sweet and high-pitched for some. I love and applaud the fact that this brilliant young woman wrote all her own songs, a dying art it seems in the business of music. It's a shame that she didn't go farther. Worth checking out and giving a try."
2,Nothing New,"I was expecting something entirely different when I got the album. Rachel is being promoted as something new, fresh and rockin', but her music sounds the same as every other new pop performer. The music has a very bubblegum flavor to it. I was disappointed and not all that impressed."
2,Not that great,"First off, most of her songs are so repetitive that they get really annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar. The lyrics aren't that great either, just the typical pop stuff going around now. One song - beautiful - even sounds like a brittany spears song. The only thing I can say about this album is that the songs, just like most songs on the radio now, get stuck in your head quite easily. Don't waste your money; go buy Brand New's album - Deja Entendu, or Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper."
1,"damn, not another teenie bopper!","rachel farris's debut album soak is eaisly the worst album of the year. much like hilary duff, rachel uses ""heavy metal"" gitars and instramentals in a attempt to be edgy.and again like hilary duff her bublegum pop voice confuses the sound. her lyrics go no where when she is ""deep"" and when her innuendos and abscrities rest the songs are pointless.i am not going to further furnish your imaganation with my opinion, i will however save you the troubleDO NOT BY THE ALBUM OR SUPPORT RACHEL FARRIS IN ANYWAYif you as a listener have any integrity."
3,Somewhat satisfied,"I wish the supplier, when avertising a product, would discribe the product in its entirely. Example - This watch states ""Mans Watch"" but the watchband just fits my wrist(I only weight 210 Lbs). This watch band watch band was adjusted to its maximum length upon receipt and to me it sems to made to fit a ""Man"" with thin wrists weighing about 175 Lbs.I can just get this watch over my hand.Maybe extra links are available?"
4,Good value for money,Shipped in a timely manner -- Received as advertised -- Looks GOOD -- If it holds up in service i will be happy
3,Onwards and upwards,"The Flaming Sideburns' previous album ""Save Rock and Roll"" lends its title to the first song on ""Sky Pilots"". The former is a party hound's idle boast soaked in winking irony, the latter a true believer's desperate request. In my books, that's progress in the right direction. Plus the geetarist has started to figure out melody. If they ever start boasting again these guys could get interesting. Until then, ""Sky Pilots"" shows the Sideburns not just backing out of the garage, but backing out at 60 miles per hour."
3,Review for Counterpoint,"I bought this book for my music college class. It's pretty much straight forward and an easy read. Although this book is a bit confusing at times, it is still helpful if one wants to learn about music theory."
4,Reviewed by a schooled musician,"96% of the the musical scores are in Soprano, Alto, and Tenor Clefs (4% Treble)! If you can read these clefs easily, your laughing - go Violas! Great book it's smaller than I imagined it, but great none the less. If your looking for a great book for 18th century counterpoint. Check out 'Essentials of Eighteenth-Century Counterpoint' by Neal B. Mason. ISBN 0-697-29780-25 stars if all the musical scores were in Treble and Bass"
2,Not my favorite,"This video may have been good toward the beginning, but it definitly has something to be desired. The tape starts off with some of my all time favorites like ""Disorder in the court"", (1936), ""Malice in the palace"", (1949), ""Sing a song of six pants"", (1947), and ""Brideless groom"", (1947). But after that, it goes into early episodes with Ted Healy like ""Beer and pretzles"", (1933), ""Nertsery rhymes"" (which in my opinion is the worst of all, 1933), ""Plane nuts"", (1933), and later comes ""The Big idea"", (1934). These were all so musical. Nothing like the stooges would later be. Then, it gets better again, with some of Shemp's solo shorts. In my opinion, these are very good. They are: ""Corn on the cop"", (1933), ""His first flame"", (1933), and ""Saltwater daffy"", (1933). I didn't much care for ""Roast beef and movies"" either. It's so-so. But still, I wouldn't waste my money"
3,The backyard orchardist-- a near miss,"From the reviews I had expected much more from this book. I regret spending to money to buy it. Last spring I put in a small orchard and found the book to be a bit short on specifics. It contained the type of information I had already gotten from my nursery about pollinators, root stocks, chill times, etc. though the book only covers a few very common varieties. I found the pruning section to be too much of an overview. I was able to find the much more comprehensive information I needed (not only on pruning, but on pest management, fertilization, irrigation, etc.) from various state agricultural extension services--on line."
5,good,The Book was as advertised and helped me a lot with the few apple trees that I have in my back yard. Would recommend to any back yard orchardist.
3,Garening,I bought this book because I wanted to learn to care for the fruit trees and plants in my yard. This book looks like it has a lot of good information but honestly unless you are really good at gardening it is very wordy. I don't think I will sit and read it but I will probably use it as a reference book.
3,Will not measure ipe,"Bought to check the moisture content of ipe, the wood was too hard for this unit to work. I returned it."
2,not very good,I got this from the library and was not very impressed. The book is small and not very in depth. Was hopeing for more as I just planted 3 new fruit trees in my back yard. would look elsewhere.
4,good info,am reviewing this as a source of info for classes on growing fruit at home. Helps the novice gardener get started
4,The Backyard Orchardist,The beginning fruit grower will benefit from this book with some information for even the advanced grower.
3,pretty good for a 78 year old jazz singer,"Do not start here if you're not familiar with the Father of Vocalese. After you've listened to his work with the ineffable LH&R you will appreciate what this guy has done for jazz singing. It is great to hear some of his descendant ""sing along"" with him on this late date: the two tracks with Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau and George Benson and the one with Manhattan Transfer are superb and definitely worth the price of admission."
3,freddie the freeloader,"i really liked freddie freeloader (i.e. the song, not the whole album by that name) on the radio and bought it, just that one song from itunes. some of the songs on this album sound good based on the preview but not all."
2,Disappointing,"Out of the 50 songs, I found about 7 that were very enjoyable. These were mainly the bouncy swing tunes like ""Requestfully Yours."" The majority of songs had a sappy quality about them and insipid arrangements. The melodys are tired and Vaughn Monroe, though a likably guy, is a lackluster singer. Why did many otherwise great bands often record banal things like ""O Promise Me"" featured in this collection? I was very disappointed."
2,Not what I expected,"Terrazza had some good beats to it but I was disappointed that there weren't more vocal tracks. I do love instrumental tracks but for some reason I expected more because of other Bargroove albums I have bought. Although this one was not my favorite, it depends on a person's mood and musical taste if this would be worth buying. Eventhough this sucked I still enjoy the Bargrooves series and will continue to buy them."
3,If only...,"...the same thought had gone into CD2 as it did in CD1. CD1 is a perfectly mixed background cd for the occasional house/deck party where the cosmos are freely poured and the banter is light. The listening is as easy at 6pm as it is at 3am.Unfortunately, CD2 loses the ambiance factor; it feels like a double-wide addition to an estate...not worth the sonic time.I'm not unhappy that I bought this compilation, but I'd be road weary with comps from the same producers. You can't buy single-CD import ambient for the price of these two CDs, and you don't get import ambient quality either, but this comp (at least CD1) should find its way into your iPod or DDJ...just in case ."
5,Wayne- Better With Age,"I am a big Watson fan, so it takes a lot for me to say this: from front to back, this self titled release is Wayne's best all around. From track 1 ""More Than A Little Unusual"", to ""Merciful Heaven"", to ""Finest Hour"", to ""The Blood of Jesus"", to ""Everything Can Change So Fast"", This is one of those rare CDs that I don't skip tracks when I play it."
2,slow going,"This video is very pretty to watch.... once.But the exercises are extremely slow, with very long transitions between the different sections.You need to take more than an hour for a mediocre workout.I did not feel like I was making any effort and certainly not getting a hard workout.The bonus clips are nice though, if you want to get a glimpse into the life of NYC ballet dancers."
3,"A good book, but very easy Exercises.","Good Photos,Very Exercises but how can i learn the Split? or other extreme Exercises and stretches?"
3,same,"i said The Same is becaser you are if you azre young thasn OK Great, But for older OLDER in ballet you need propanocil and the BEST WORKOUT which i is I What I Do NOW"
4,Good Exercises and Stretches,"I found the stretches and exercises in this book beneficial, and could really feel my muscles working. I enjoyed the floor barre section, and I feel that if I had enough time to do the exercises more regularly I would really see the benefits. I am a teenage dancer, at an intermediate level, but I feel that the exercises would be beneficial for both non dancers and dancers at all levels. Some of the exercises could be difficult if the individual is not flexible at all, and some of the center exercises could be rather simple for intermediate to advanced level dancers. All in all I enjoyed the workout and the book (especially the lovely photographs and information about dancers in the New York City Ballet)."
5,"buy it, do it","The exercises in this book are easy to follow, and result in stronger longer well proportioned muscles. Most of us use our major muscle groups only, while the exercises in this book are designed for the forgotten muscles. I don't think the first half of the book is necessary--I thought it was worthless. However, the workout itself I think is great, and I have given the book to a few friends. The bottom line is that I highly recommend the book for the excellent exercises."
5,I am pleased that I bought this book.,"This is a beautiful yet practical book. The exercises are very accessible and the photographs are inspirational. This book blows away the myth that ballet is bad for you. The exercises are simple, safe and effective. The New York City Ballet Workout has found a permanent home in my dance bag, it's a perfect warm-up for dancers of any age."
3,binding falls apart,"The content of this book is OK, but the quality of the book is poor. After relatively little use, the binding fell apart and most of the pages are loose, so it's extremely inconvenient to use."
4,Best for those with some ballet experience,"This is a fantastic book, beautifully illustrated, and with 50 exercises you can tailor your own workout. The only flaw is that not enough time is spent on basic posture, which has a tremendous affect on the effect of the exercises. For this reason, I think the book is best for those who've taken some basic ballet classes."
5,Great book!,I am enjoying reading this book. The exercises are very useful. It's worth buying the book just to be able to look at the pictures!
1,A terrible message to send kids,"What a disappointment. I love the PJ Funnybunny books, and bought them for my grandson. So when I saw this book I ordered it in good faith for my young granddaughter. But the story is so inappropriate I'd be embarrassed to give it to anyone. The jist of the story is that PJ torments his sister, for example dumping smashed carrots on her head and hiding her favorite blanket. But when his parents make him stop, she misses him. Then, when he paints polka dots on her face while she is sleeping, mom affirms it's because he really does love her. Seriously? THAT is the message we want to teach our kids in this age of bullying? It's not even funny enough for cynical adults."
4,Cute Book - Bad Reviews are overreactions,"My kids love this book. Sure, if you think the Harry Potter Books make your children convert into witchcraft and can find something nefarious about Horton Hears a Who, you should stay away from this book. This book tells a cute story and my beginner reader enjoys reading it."
5,I love the Honey Bunny Funny Bunny book,I bought this book to read to my 2 year old grandson because I call him my honey bunny! I think I love the book as much or more than he does! It's fun reading this book to the little ones and I highly recommend it to anyone that has children.Jeanie Ray
1,Not so Funny Bunny,"Really sorry I read this book to my 5 year old. Honey Bunny's brother teases her incessantly - she finally gets upset and tells her parents - brother gets in trouble and now won't speak or play with Honey Bunny - Honey Bunny misses him teasing her and thinks that he doesn't love her anymore - brother paints her face again so mom says ""He DOES love you."" What kind of lesson is this for our kids? I checked this book out for my daughter from the library, but felt so strongly about the horrible lesson that I had write a review. If the book had ended with the brother apologizing, I would be okay with it. But, to teach our kids that teasing means someone loves you? Wrong! I wish I could give it -5 stars."
3,A good opportunity to discuss teasing,"This book is not a dissertation of sibling relationships, which are a bit too complicated to discuss in an EZ Reader children's book....It's the story of a little girl and her brother. Like many siblings, PJ teases Honeybunny. He teases her a lot.For a little boy bunny, teasing is the way he shows his affection towards his sister. Probably not the way most parents would want their children to show affection towards each other, but it is highly accurate.My own sister would tease me mercilessly. But if anyone else tried to tease me? She'd jump to my defense in a heartbeat.This is a story reflecting that reality, not encouraging it. And it's also a nice way for parents to discuss with their children the consequences of teasing....I thought this was a sweet book about the problems with siblings. A good way to open up the lines of communication between siblings."
4,Funny Memories,"I wish the serious reviewers of this book would get over themselves! My older brother teased me endlessly, but what else do older brothers do to their little sisters? I think this book merely sets the stage for opening dialog between older brothers and younger sisters about the differences between the sexes and about reconciliation. The adults reading the book to their youngsters can seize the opportunity to elaborate and teach! I honestly didn't think that the story ended where the book did and that the relationship between these two would change.Books are tools to learn things from and not everything has to be written in black and white. I loved the book and I'm even buying it for my older brother just for a gag gift on his birthday."
1,Awful,"I really can't stand this book, would never buy it for any child, and would give it negative stars if I could. It gives an awful message, especially to young girls, that abusive behavior is a sign of love. I can't imagine why anyone would want to read this story to a child."
1,Bad hike recommendations,"Worst recommendation of a hike in any hiking book I've ever read. The book recommended a hike to Mt. Strachan in the Cypress ski area, on a trail that was terrible. Completely overgrown in places, unsigned in crucial places, blowdown to the point that you might as well have been bushwhacking, etc. We finally gave up and went up the ski area road, a much better option not mentioned in the book.Directions to the Garibaldi Lake trailhead were poor.I'm tossing this book."
2,Poor Trail Maps and Directions,"Having relied on the Pacific Northwest Hiking Guides published by The Mountaineers, I found this book to be almost laughable. Wanting to explore more of western BC, this guide looked like a good choice. The book did point me in some good directions, and a couple of hikes I did were absolute gems. However, I found many of the hikes to be lacking in basic information such as good directions to the trailhead, some trailheads almost impossible to find, road conditions that should have been clearly marked as 4 wheel drive only yet gave no indication of that requirement, and trail maps that were more sketches than anything else. So use this book to give you good hiking suggestions, but then do your additional research by getting a good topo map and checking all road and trail conditions before you head out"
1,Dog Toy,"I purchased this Deedle Dude Rabbit for my little dog because she had one before and loved the happy tune, but this one did not sing. It sounds like a real light rumble noise. I was sent a defective broken toy for my dog. I won't order another one....I will just wait until I find another one at a pet store so that I can verify that it actually sings."
2,Surprised it's an actual dog toy,"Recently purchased the bunny and my dog really seemed to enjoy it at first. However, when turned back for a second, he had ripped the musical component out and thoroughly apart. There were tiny shards of hard plastic and metal everywhere (including the little batteries). I would've thought the fabric would have been quite a bit better than it turned out to be. If you have a dog that likes to rip out the squeaker from toys, please be careful with this toy."
1,All Deedle Dudes break in less than an hour,"They play a cute tune but they break in less than an hour. It really is a shame, because my dog really does love them. Oh well!"
1,4 times only,"I just gave my dog this toy she loved it b/c it sang a long weird song. However, after four ""deedle le dee"" songs it went dead and doesn't work. My dog dumped it on the side and is very disinterested in it now. My only option is to pay for a return ship. What a waste of money."
5,Deedle Dude Singing Rabbit,This was a Christmas gift for our Jack Russell. Such a funny voice when he sings...my dog runs all over the house making it sing. Very very funny.
5,Best toy of all,This rabbit toy has caused war with my 2 poodles. One of which is a blind dog and the other 9 1/2 years old. I don't know but I only purchased 1 of this toy and thought I had purchased more. There have been so many fights as they are both wanting this rabbit.There has been punch up fights with the 2 poodles hitting each other in the face to get it first. I guarantee your dog will just love it but please get a few as 1 is not enough.
4,An album of greatest hits by Schubert from a charming singer,"This CD contains chestnuts from Schubert's vast output of lieder, and for experienced listeners, Hendricks's other Schubert CD, also with Radu Lupu, contains more of interest, since the program wanders from the beaten path. Even so, she is a charming lyric soprano, and her approach to each song is light and flutey, if that's a word. Don't lok for deth or seriousness, however. Lupu is quite a recessive player in his own right, and together with Hendricks their collaboration strikes me as almost aloof. After half a dozen songs everything started to sound alike. But this consistency may not bother other listeners, and there's no doubt that few Schubert recitals have sounded so ravishing on the ear."
2,hardware problem,"I have been very happy with the performance of the G5 but for one very annoying feature. Very recently, a high-pitch sound appeared from the otherwise very quiet desktop unit. Browsing of the large internet Mac community pages revealed that my unit is not the only one with that problem. While the final diagnostic awaits confirmation, the majority of comments points to flaws in the design of the processor control and/or in the powersupply. To my great dismay, Apple customer service showed itself very uncorporative. For such an expensive equipment, low-end service is not acceptable. In conclusion, the computer performance warrants 4 stars, the recent problems led to a very annoying noise problem that lowers it to 2 stars, and the response from Apple is just disappointing (does not qualify for any star). One Apple a day keeps the doctor away. But only one without worms..."
2,Really more like 2 1/2 stars,"I bought this book based on the reviews here, but I was fairly disappointed. The pictures and the layout leave much to be desired, and the text is not bad, but not great either. I could not hold my two-year-old's attention with this one, although he will sit still for most books. Frankly, I had purchased this book partially because of the photographs, but I think I would rather just show my son ""A Child is Born"" or ""Your Amazing Newborn"" and explain the text to him. There just wasn't as much information here as I had hoped for. This is certainly not a bad book, especially for slightly older children, but it is not a great book either."
5,Silky Pantyhose,"I have been wearing Hanes hosiery for years and Hanes Silk Reflections are my favorite. I have these in every color available and love the look and feel of them when I wear them. They are a great bargain very sheer and silky pantyhose at a decent price. They are durable lasting me 5 and more wearings from every pair.As an Amazon Prime member I get free 2 day shipping on my orders so that makes these a great buy, I may never go to the department store again to buy my hose."
3,"Great Music, But...","Very nice to have available some of the Kings' fine Bluebird sides that BMG has no desire to make available, but buyer beware:- typical of Flare, this is a CDR;- also typical of Flare, sound quality is inconsistent;- the first copy I purchased was blank, the only time this has happened to me in 17 years of CD buying; the second was defective with the last five tracks unplayable."
4,Reissued at a budget price!,"Recordings of Leonel Power's music are not exactly thick on the ground: This is the only CD I know of which is entirely devoted to Power's music. It has been out of print for many years and the third party sellers are charging more than twice of its original price. (I got mine for around $30.) Fortunately it was reissued last year in Virgin Veritas x 2 series:Power and Dunstaple Masses & Motets. That reissue also contains Hilliard's famed (and award winning) recording ofJohn Dunstaple's Motets.Leonel Power's Missa Alma redemptoris mater is the earliest extant (English) cyclic cantus-firmus mass and is very worth listening to for anyone interested in (early English) renaissance music. There is only one other recording of this mass known to me:Trio Mediaeval: Soir, Dit-Elle. Both are worth the small prices of admission, but my (slight) preference goes to the Hilliard's."
4,My First ABC Board Book,"ISBN 0789427818 - No age range stated. Printed and bound in China. Board book, 32 pages. A My First Word book. Published by DK Publishing Inc., in 1999. Designed by Helen Melville, edited by Rachel Wordley, Us Editor Nicole Zarick, photographer Jerry Young.Each letter of the alphabet is featured alongside large, colorful photos of things that begin with that letter. From A for acorns to Z for zipper, the color photos are easily recognizable, common things that small people will know from the real world, making this bit of learning a little easier.The book is slightly smaller than a standard paperback, so it's perfect for taking along when you're out. The pages are glossy, so they wipe clean easily, and the fact that they're board means they're easier for small fingers to handle than thin paper. The photos are fantastic. They're colorful, bright and easily identified. The text is, of course, basic - perfect for beginning readers and even younger kids.- AnnaLovesBooks"
4,Pantyhose,The hose were not as sheer as I would have liked and the color is too tan. I need to try something different
2,Sizing Is Off & Color Is Horrible,"I've always loved this brand of pantyhose in the past, because of the great feel and fit, but some things have changed and not for the better. I ordered 5 pairs. Four in the ""barely there"" color, which is now a horrible orangish color instead of being ""barely there"" like they used to be, and one pair in a ""barely black"", which is a nice color. I ordered pairs for both my daughter and myself, using the size chart. We both had problems with the length, being too short for both of us. The ""barely there"" color is really horrible, like a bad tan. I'm sending back the three pairs that we didn't try on. I definitely won't be buying these again."
1,Total disappointment,"Given the positive reviews that folks have left for Hanes Sheer Panty Hose, I was excited when my sheer Jet (black) pair came in the mail. Unfortunately, I only was able to wear them one day to work before noticing that they had pulled all over the back of my legs, both left and right. There must've been hundreds of dark lines that formed over the course of the day, they looked completely ridiculous and I will certainly never be able to wear them again. I have never purchased a pair of sheer hose that I was only able to wear once, and given the quality of this pair, I won't bother trying again with Hanes. What a disappointment."
5,Awesome Stockings,It's hard to find a good shade of smokey grey and these are perfect. Good for work or meeting for drinks. Soft and don't slide down as you wear it through-out the day.
4,not quite barely there,"love the quality of these pantyhose, but I should have chosen nude as barely there is a bit darker in person and incongruent with my skin color. If I wear them without tanning first my legs will look weird, so I will hold onto them for now."
3,Good for a couple of hours,"I got three pairs in different colors. They look really nice, but get don't last long at all. I wore these hose to two formal events. No dancing or moving around involved, yet they started to run just a few hours into the evening(my toenails are always cut very short, in case you're wondering).If you are planning on wearing these hose with flats or low-mid heel then they might last, but wearing high heeled shoes definitely puts a lot of pressure on the toe area causing tears.Also, I am 5'0, 86 pounds, size A/B was a tight fit. They definitely run small."
4,Good product!,"Got these for graduation (nursing school) and had never worn pantyhose before...These were easy to put on and didn't tear or ""run"". Were a lot more comfortable than expecting! The color was very pretty (white). Can't compare to other styles because these are the only ones I've tried, but I think they're great."
4,Wish list fullfilled.,I purchased this last year as a Christmas gift for an adult aged godson.He was happy to get it.
5,YAY,I oredered this for Christams for my son and it arrived well in advance of the holiday. It is exactly what I ordered and he has enjoyed it very much.
4,Hotel co USMC,I liked the move Vietnam in HD.The only thing I thought was wrong is when thay talked about the Marines thay showed footage of Army Grunts.So I ordered the move the Pacific!I dont think that will be a problem. Semper Fi
3,JUST GOT IT,"I just got this documentary today, although i saw it on TV and that's the reason why i bought it, im in Argentina, but im very fond to American History, and this is a very interesting and important part on the American War History, so to me was a MUST HAVE.I still didnt play the disc, im not at home at the moment (but i will comeback on that) so i cant yet give a review on the image and audio quality. So far package is ok, nothing amazing, but just ok, nice printing cover on the disc surface.Funny detail, in the back cover, says: 2 color discs, approx. 4.42 hrs total. But in the description says ""... An epic six-hour miniseries"", nothing important but i found it funny, since i dont know if i have 4.42 minutes or 6 hours of high qualitiy video matieral!:D"
3,No Navy or Air Force?,"Curious as to the Navy and Air Force not getting much air play in this show. Maybe a better title would have been ""Ground Forces in Vietnam in HD""Maybe there will cover the other services in other shows because you can't call it Vietnam if you only show the ground forces."
4,got it for mi dad,got this for mi dad as a chrismas gif realy liked de colors and rear pictures that i haven't seen before
5,Entertaining-Education-Epic!,"After watching WW2 in HD I wanted to see something more like it, that's when I decided to watch this one, might as well buy it. The picture and images from the war seem so clear like it was shot recently. The timeline of events is so precise, it made me better understand the war. There is some graphic scenes of gore, so viewer discretion, for sensitive people. But overall this is a masterpiece as WW2 in HD, I sincerely recommend watching it"
1,vietnam,"...the makers of this DVD..... DO NOT understand what it was like during that terrible time......The fear in every male teenagers face can't be explained by actors,or politicans...OR shoddy research..ONLY those that brought home that terrible burden do"
5,Great documentary,This is a great documentary with some excellent footage and good clear images. I just wish Amazon would have been able to sell the version with the extra disc that you get if you buy it directly from History channel. I preferred Amazon due to a lower overall price and superior customer service.
1,Utterly horrid,The vintage film used in this documentary has been stretched to fit the 16:9 aspect ratio. The result is an ugly distorted mess. Not acceptable.
5,"vietnam in hd,blu-ray edition",i absolutely loved this on blu-ray.it really shows what the vietnam war was like.it has actual rare archival footage and home movies in high definition.i watch it all the time.it has interviews with people who were in the vietnam war.its absolutely stunning.i recommend this on blu-ray.its one of my favorite shows.
4,Vietnam in HD,"I really liked it, I thought it was well done. That being said, they cover the same major events that are always covered, and from the American point of view only."
4,A unique vision,"Steve Simon is the artist as well as the author of the verse within this book. To celebrate Calfornia's 150 years of statehood, Mr. Simon took a glorious roadtrip throughout his adopted state and captured it on canvas. California is a remarkble state because within it are colorful deserts, lush mountains, magnificent coastlines and unique lifestyles. Mr. Simon's book shows that he was able to capture California's essence in a manner that is both stunning and touching. This book is a must have for anyone who enjoys art and California."
4,if you don't love karl we can not be friends,"This man puts on the best/cheapest shows one could hope to see. He's much more crisp live but this album stands firm alone. If you like gloss over rawness this may not be for you. The dancier tracks like heatherwood,put me back, and what's not to fall in love with are my stand outs though all karl blau music is created equal. it has healing powers."
4,Great book for any art project.,"This book was great for any art project. I use the easy to use cd-rom to create borders for invitations, brochures, ads, labels, and so much more. The only complaint I have is there are alot of repeat of the same design, I believe they are meant to be different sizes but I found them unnessesary. Other than that I loved it!"
5,Wonderful book,This book (with CD) is great. There are lots of images for numerous projects. Having the CD saves lots of scanning time and frustration. Highly recommended.
