1,Watch Out For Unauthorized Copies!,"Don't be fooled by the MANY sellers pushing unauthorized ""imports"" of this title! If the graphic side of the disc isn't blue (with silver text) and it wasn't made in the USA, it's 100% fake!"
2,Boilerplate,"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it to consist of boilerplate meditation and awareness text and exercise, such as I have seen in so many other books! I would have appreciated more thought being put into this book! I am frustrated about spending my money on it."
5,Beautiful Bookshelf for The Price,Love the bookshelf. it is very sturdy and elegant for the price. I am very satisfy with my new bookshelf!
2,no attachments,it did not come with attachments as it said it would and it was pictured that way as well. very misleading
4,Still overpriced,The book arrived in brand new condition. The price paid at the time was lowest on the internet as brand new but still not a great deal. Recommend buying used for cheaper if possible.
2,A very interesting book... for those who understand statistics,The book has a lot of examples and is a must have for those majoring in Finance. Some Universities use this for Intro to Statistics and this book is very didactic. The way it's written out in a form that takes you a another level of reading which makes you feel you're in a rainbow... a reading rainbow... Anway... The book has answers in the back so it's good enough for whenever the professor assigns Homework.
1,completely not in condition stated,"the book description said ""with CD-ROM and InfoTrac"" but the book came with the CD-ROM and InfoTrac missing.on top of that, book was old, broken on the corners, and very dirty."
1,The book still has not arrived !!,"I am still waiting for the book, it is now a week and a half late. This seller SUCKS !!!"
1,not satisfied,"Said that CD was in the book, Statistics for Business & Eco, it was not. Would not return my calls and would not give me a refund. I needed the CD for the class that is why I chose to buy from him."
5,good book,"i had get this book at a last minute, the time it took to arrive was very reasonable no complaints,"
5,Great Service and Quality,"Not only did they save me $150, but LV-LA Books responded to my inquiry within 24 hours. They were very nice to work with and the quality of the book was just as the description said. I highly recommend this seller."
3,Not the best book on the subject and the price......,"I teach Stats 201 (Introduction to Business Statistics) and for years I used the textbook by Wiers, which I feel is the best in it's field. After numerous obsrvations by my colleagues in the department, we hope that will be going back to the previous author's book after the current stock of this one runs out.I find this book to be confusing, and it tends to jump around a lot rather than give a structured look at the process of learning Statistics. It pays little or no attention to the use of random numbers and the terminology is confusing.Perhaps the biggest drawback with this book is the price- almost 150 bucks for a textbook is outrageous. Buy the previous edition used- the difference is minimal, the price difference is significant. Better still- buy the book on the same subject by Wiers. Don't just take my word- compare the two....it's just my opinion."
2,"Not comprehensive, hard to follow","Statistics for Business and Economics (with CD-ROM)This book is geared toward business majors who need to have a solid understanding of statistical data as it relates to business concepts. Algebra was a pre-requisite when I took this course, but being familiar with algebra and its concepts won't help you much. Topics are not explained thoroughly which leaves the task of finding the missing pieces to understand the concept to the reader. Working the sample problems provides you with an answer, but doesn't walk you through the steps to solving the problem.The book also skips over some topics that are in other broader based basic statistics books. Some of which I feel are important for business majors to know as they work with their clients, who may not be business majors. I had to purchase another book to de-code what this one was saying. Once I did, I was able to understand the material better."
4,Not Too Bad,"I have a basic statistics background before I read this book. For me, the book is useful for my basic quantitative research. Last few chapters apply the statistics rules in earlier chapters to the real business environment, which I think it's really practical and interesting. The most I like in this book is the practice questions at the end of each chapter, which apply to everyone's daily life. However, first four chapters cover too many unnecessary topics."
1,This book requires outside help!,"This book tends to jump off topic (most aren't explained well). For example, they talk about one thing but the exercises are a bit different than the chapter's topic. Most of the information isn't fully explained. If you are in a class where the instructor assigns the exercise questions for homework, you are screwed. You may not know what to do unless you seek outside help (study guide, tutor etc.) or read beyond the chapter."
2,Gooey pop that melts away before its done.,Got tired of it after a spin or two. I don't even think I own it anymore. If you love catchy and over produced pop music then this disc is for you.
4,"Beautiful, inspiring","This gorgeous book is like a coffee-table book you can actually read! It's fun, engaging, and even silly at times, yet the overall experience is even more satisfying than watching Jurassic Park."
5,"Insightful, playful, visually sumptuous.Why the controversy?","I loved Mitchell's playful way of using visual evidence from our culture--cartoons, book covers, installation art, children's toys, film clips--to show us something profound about ourselves. Some of the controversy over this book might have to do with a resistance to demystifying our obsession with dinosaurs--a resistance that would entirely support Mitchell's thesis."
4,This is a play concerning the conquest of Peru,"Royal Hunt Of The Sun contains three tragedies: One of destruction of the great Inca empire; the tragedy of Pizarro, who destroys something for which he has been searching all his life, and the tragedy of Martin Ruiz, whose youthful idealism is destroyed by his experience in Peru. The main theme of this play which concerns the search for religion. All through the play Shaffer contrasts the beauty and high values of the Incas and the greed and ugliness of the Spanish."
5,Lucy Brown was AWESOME!!!!,"I had the pleasure of seeing these guys years ago at Wetlands in NYC. Wetlands was a great club with a close intimate feeling. I met Gene the singer in 92 when my band Copious Jive was playing in the McDougal area of the village. I listened to thier CD for about a year before actually seeing the band live...and that was an explosive rewarding experience. Gene, being a baritone had one of the most soulful voices I have ever heard, and his phrasing ability was right on with the music. All great heavy players that worked well together. Super tight drum chops, Good slap poppin bass, Heavy crunchin guitar riffs, with good funky breakdown undertones. I believe these guys would have gone very far if not for the passing of Gene. I had the rare opportunity of partying with the guys after a gig one night, and....what a great group of people. My friends and I being old funk fans, really really enjoyed this unique, one of a kind sound. I will keep in with my favorites forever!!!!"
4,H,Franklin: The Best of Franklin will be a gift probably for my granddaughter but my grandson loves him very much and he will receive a different dvd - Franklin Hockey Hero. I like the fact that I can purchase the dvds and books from Amazon as they have a nice collection. Both children are 2 and 1/2 and 3.
3,I really cannot decide about this film.,"On one hand, the film depicts a truly foul evil committed by the Imperial Japanese Empire that should and must be told. On the other hand, the director tortured animals on screen(rats and cats) and purchased a corpse for an onscreen autopsy---seemingly learning nothing from his subject. He also apparently believes the Communist lie that the United Nation used biological warfare during the Korean War. The film is also wildly graphic and violent in a way that teeters terribly close to pornography. So on one hand, he depicts a great evil------while embracing evil of another stripe. Unfortunate that victims of Unit 751 cannot have their story told in a film with a more certain integrity......but this is all we have at the moment."
3,Rehash of the Internet articles,"Educational in a story setting. Worth watching when nothing else has your interest. Many countries have done similar things, and not just in war time."
3,A letdown for a big fan of shock cinema,"Before I purchased this film I had heard a ton of people say this film was disturbing, but to me only one scene was sort of shocking and that was it. The film was more about a group of new young trainees at the facility than it was about the atrocities commited by the 731 bacterial corps unit. Big letdown for me, and might be for fans of films of the bizarre and macabre."
1,Good Film for people who don't like cats and rats,"I had read all the hype about this film. How shocking and disturbing it was. You have no idea what a disappointment this DVD was. Very boring. The few moments that show ""gore or violence"" are very weak, poorly shot, and the effects were cheap. You could see much more violent and disturbing things by randomly picking ANY horror film from the shelf at the video store. There is one slightly nauseating scene involving an autopsy of a supposed REAL corpse. Still I've seen worse footage of surgeries on the Discovery channel. the worst thing about this film is the footage of the REAL live cat fed to the room full of starving rats. This was out of place and totally unprofessional of the ""film makers"". And I use that term loosely. Later the same rats are set on fire. For real. Some real entertainment here, folks. If you are interested in the true war crimes of Unit 731 go read a book. Gore hounds like myself will be severly dissapointed."
1,having seen most shocking horror films,having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye. having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film. do not watch this film. it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of. the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!!

2,Are you Kidding,"I cannot beleive all these reviews I have been reading about this movie.....So terrible, So real what atrocities.......it is not even shocking...sorry..I wasted my money.....It is not even believable.."
1,Dead pixels; TV quality is no good; overheats,"I've had this monitor for just a few weeks, and exchanged it for an HP model after it has developed multiple dead pixels (about one pixel per week). The Samsung warranty policy on dead pixels for a 19-inch monitor requires you to have at least 7 dead pixels for a replacement - which means that you will be stuck if there are only 6 dead pixels or the 7th pixel appears after the warranty expires.The TV quality is very poor, although the monitor and speaker quality is pretty good. The monitor also runs too hot compared to most others models I have seen."
5,This book saved me money.,"Moving overseas was very difficult for the family. Leaving our home made all of us sad even though we were in a new place. When we discovered after a year had gone by our property management company had neglected our home my wife and I were very upset.We switched companies, but learned how to ask better questions from this book. In particular, the idea that we didn't have to use the mgmt. companies contractors saved us money when the hot water heater failed and needed replacement. Rower's simple style, use of key ideas, helped us understand our rights better and expect better service from our management company. We learned to be very demanding of the property manager, insistent that they solicit more bids, including bids of contractors recommended to us by others. Reading the book made us understand that though we were far away, the property management company had to ""manage"" the property the way we wanted it done."
3,"Back again, but does anyone care","Some of Cheeks CD's are the most uderated out there. he brings an original sound that no one seems to care about, its not his best work, but still better than most. you need to listen to this cd front to back and the back to the front. This cd will grow on you, a week from now it will still be in rotation in your car or your IPOD. No track stands out as the best, but the all are worth blasting out of your speakers."
2,kiss my mr.a** cheeks,"I just cant believe this 11 track piece of rubbish is remotely connected to the lost boyz. With the exception of 2 or 3 tracks this whole album is r'n'b. Soft casio beats with over sampled loops from the disco and funk catalogue's matched only by mr.cheeks increasingly wack flow. I honestly find this hard to swallow cuz i was a huge fan of the lost boyz albums. I wasnt overly impressed with cheeks 1st solo joint but it had some bright moments so i gave it the benefit of the doubt and it did grow on me the more i listened to it. No chance of this 1 doing the same as ive had it 2 months and listen 2 it at least once a week since i got it. I finally had enough and threw it away. Thats how bad it is. Save your money, save your sanity..WACK!!!!!!!!"
5,buy it!!,"...Back Again is one of the best albumsright now.The best tracks on the cd are The Hussle,Supposed toand The wire. U got to check it out!!"
1,Back again to do what.,"Let me stop laughing-okay-It's bad enough that some company actually give him money to record a album. Why why why. Someone needs to stop mess like this from coming out. I listend to this album in my car and it gave me road rage. That is how bad it was. Why is his name Mr.Cheeks and he is a dude. That doesn't sound right. Mr.Cheeks need to have is voice box removed, so he can't rap anymore. Mr.cheeks gets 1 star because he actually thinks he can rap and that he was a member of the lost boyz."
3,"cute, until you use it.","This bag is oversized and super cute...even arrives in a protective bag. However, the material inside is a rough and cheap material that scratched a pair of sunglasses. Then, after using it, I realized it scuffs EASILY! I used it maybe 3 times, and I have retired it to my niece. It is embarrassing to have to constantly scrub grey streaks off it every few minutes. Also, the bag isnt white...its a weird creamy ivory. It clashes with every white shirt I own."
3,"Lacks substance...I'll save you $13.95 and reveal the ""secret""","This book can be summed up in one sentence:""Give away money in the form of 'tithing' and you will receive money back from the Universe from various 'unexpected' avenues, usually ten-fold.""And THAT'S IT!Vitale goes on to say that you'll get back what you give. If you give time, you'll get time. If you give books, you'll get books. You get the picture.He goes on to say that you should give from the bottom of your heart and not just to give to get something on the backend. He talks about how you don't need to tithe money to a church only but perhaps a charity that's very important to you or a school to benefit children. Give to whatever makes you feel good and never feel obligated otherwise it's wrong.It's a powerful concept but if he wanted to drag it out he should have included examples, stories, illustrations, and perhaps some other types of attraction laws to ""beef it up"" a bit."
4,"Classic Joe, Gotta Love It","Although I can't say ""WOW! There are 325 new methods, tools or secrets to apply in this new book!"" I can say that the writing is classic Joe Vitale.If you are NEW to Joe's work, its worth the money. If you are NOT new to Joe's work, its worth the money.His approach is pure, his heart is in the right place and he is quite successful at what he does!In other words, a man to watch with admiration and learn from regularly.Buy this book. If you have a decent attitude you will gain value from it. If you look for wrong in everything, save your money. You will find wrong no matter what and I wouldn't want your negativity spewing on anymore people on the planet!This book is Classic Joe. You simply GOTTA love it!"
5,FANTASTIC! What a great GREAT book!,"This book is so good I'm almost speechless. The secret it reveals blew my mind. I didn't believe it at first but I tried it and almost suddenly money started showing up from unexpected sources. Believe me, I was amazed, too! This may be the best book I've ever read, at least for this year. It's little known as it is brnad new but all I can say is GET IT and probably get it for people you care about. It's a magicial gift. Great book!"
2,AGES OLD and nothing else--NOT the BBC documentary,"I was sorely disappointed upon receiving this product,as i was expecting the 1988 BBC documentary called ROCK OF AGES that you can find on youtube......The front cover looked from that era and being reasonably inexpensive,i just assumed that it must be one in the same.ALL this dvd is,is a collection of videos ANY def leppard fan has seen a jillion times.BUMMER"
2,Remixed,"For those that are interested in the original recordings this is not the album for you. I was disappointed to find out that the recordings are re-makes and not the originals. I am a big Roy Clark fan, but disappointed in this album. I'd rather have the originals remastered than the selections on this LP."
5,great album,I just saw Roy Clark at the Dosey Doe in The Woodlands--he performed most of the songs from this album. He wasn't feeling too pert (he had had a hip replacement not too long ago) but he still put on a great show!!
3,not as good as I expected,"several of the movies had skips in them. you need to like old black and white, and somewhat scary movies"
4,A good read,"At first it was hard to keep some of the characters straight, but after a while they fell into place. There were a few times when I wondered why the author went off on a tangent about something unrelated to the story. All in all, though, it was a good story with well-fleshed characters and a victory for the underdog."
5,Very Good Read!,I bought this book from the author at the MSU Arts & Crafts Festival because I needed something to read on a plane to DC. Spur of the moment purchase that I do not regret. I get very little reading time so I hoped the novel would keep me engaged. Did it ever. I was 1/2way through the book when I reached DC. I enjoyed the story so much I didn't mind the weather delay in DC since it gave me a chance to finish.
4,"Unusual, but nice and light...","While I'm a HUGE Jill Shalvis Friday Harbor fan, this stand alone book was good; however, not fabulous. It was a bit over the top unrealistic, but it was still light, and entertaining. While I thought it was so-so, it didn't sway me from how much I like this author!"
2,toss it,"Oh the disappointment! Another ho-hum book about how computers and technology are taking over the world. For an average author this book might be excusable, but not for Crichton. If you've never read Crichton, DO NOT read this one first. There are some delicious books of his that are my favorites, but this one was a stinker."
2,"Michael Baby, Stay awake when you write...","I don't know if there was an enforced deadline or a contract stating X amount of books in X amount of time because P-Yeew, this book did nothing for me. Where's my copy of CONGO, THE LOST WORLD or AIRFRAME...Now those, those were some really good apples!!! Sorry MC but never fear, I haven't lost hope. Keep putting pen to paper..."
3,Okay medical Crichton,A man suffers from seizures that make him go psycho. I found this an ok book. I liked some of his other books better.On the positive side action packed ending.On the negative side it takes too long to get to the good part.
3,"Readable, but not movie worthy.","A man goes into surgery to correct his psychotic rage, but the surgery takes a turn for the worse. He escapes and terrorizes everyone. In this small book, Crichton spends entirely too much time describing the medical procedures, the hospital politics, and the doctors themselves, while little time on the action or suspense.Usually, Crichton incorporates background and scientific information to further the plot and intrigue and suspense. Unfortunately, this book is more about the hospital than about the plot. The plot itself doesn't even contain an engrossing manhunt or chase that one would expect with an escaped maniac.It's not all bad. It is very much readable, and like most Crichton books, it's fluid and enjoyable.I'd suggest other Crichton books first, but overall, I would half heatedly recommend this."
2,An ending you will never forgive,"An interesting exploration of technology that might have been cutting edge at the time but is now severely dated, whereas Frankenstein, which it is compared to, is an incredible work (one of the few English class books I *enjoyed*).The ending literally made me hurl the book at the wall. I was furious. Some good suspense, but imo Crichton's worst."
3,Not quite what it was built up to be,"I'd concur with other reviews that the intro needed to be shorter, he could have skipped the first few chapters and started with the events in the hospital. The cover copy made me think we'd see some early cybernetic badguy, but it wasn't so grand. Looking back to 1971, this book probably was cutting edge in terms of using technology to drive the story and the character, now it seems retro."
4,Got me reading Michael Crichton,I don't really remember most of this book. I read it back in 1997. It was the first Michael Crichton book I ever read. It was a pleasure reading. I do remeber being hooked on it. I was much younger when I read it and never really liked reading for pleasure. Because of this book I started reading more for pleasure and also read more books by Michael Crichton including sphere which I read after this. Too bad Michael Crichton is no longer with us. I have always enjoyed reading his books. Ive read almost all ghe books he's written and own them most of thrm too.
3,"Crichton, The Terminal Man","The Terminal Man is a book that Stephen King convinced me to read. I read King's short story called ""The Woman In The Room."" The story is in King's collection Night Shift and briefly mentions how, according to Crichton, putting wires in people's heads can be a very bad scene. It took me a few years to get to it but I finally did and enjoyed it but not as much as I thought I would. Still, insane scientists and doctors terrify me and experimental surgery is some scary stuff. To show you what I mean, the corny scene from the film Batman and Robin in which Bane is created always gives me chills. You can understand then, if you have seen that humorously aweful film, how this book would effect me. It was a bit short though and, again for Crichton novels, it was anticlimactic in my opinion. A good read nonetheless though, especially for Crichton fans."
2,Crichton's weakest yet,"Crichton definitely let me down this time. While not too farfetched, the scenario of the story is presented in the fashion of a cheap '80's horror flick, making it seem very unrealistic. Another case of the ""escaped experiment"" goes bad when Crichton tries to pitch a moral about the dangers of technology. The whole book is one big cliche, that is almost saved by moments of suspense."
2,Flowers for Algernon in ain't,"I just finished The Great Train Robbery and looked forward to another Crichton novel when I had the bad luck to pick up Terminal Man. As some other reviewers mentioned, this isn't a terrible book but when it comes from Michael Crichton it leaves you disappointed. It had some interesting ideas and showed some promise but it never did completely take me in like Train Robbery did. The theme also seemed to be loosely based on Flowers for Algernon, in my opinion a better book by far. But don't let me dissuade you from other Crichton books. He is a talented author and has written some great books, just not in this case. One last thing, what was he thinking with that ending? Ouch!!"
2,Palatable Pulp,"*Terminal Man* was originally serialized in *Playboy* magazine and it shows... While the novel maintains typical Chricton characteristics (lots of jargon, some interesting science, and characters with only as much depth as is necessary to not drown in the plot), the original publication format shows. Despite being intended to carry you through on a sweeping suspense ride, the book is quite episodic -- it feels like a serial. Moreover, there are bits of sexuality and so forth thrown in at random times to titiliate the readers. Obviously, *Rising Sun* had a much more sexual plot, but it was purposeful. Here, the occasional sexual elements seem more gratuitous than enything else.As for the plot of medical responsibility, it's interesting, but not carried out as well as in *Jurassic Park*, which deals with a similar theme. (Just because you can do something -- should you?)"
3,Highly Improbable,"This story gives a good suggestion of the medical world, although his characters sometimes fit into a stereotype far too well - Morris, for example, who gets his just desserts rather obviously. But I found the story really improbable, because apparently this procedure had been tested many, many times in the laboratory on rhesus monkeys. Why, then, did they not realize beforehand what would happen to Benson? Ross explains to the computer technicians how she knew this would happen, and how she had seen it in lab animals before. Why didn't Elliot, then? And for something that would change Benson this drastically, why couldn't Ross impress upon the surgeons how bad of an idea it was? She kept saying, ""I think it's a bad idea,"" and nothing else. I feel Crichton did do his research, since the technical medical ideas are correct, but forgot this one small technical fact, which has ruined the entire story for me."
3,Dated but still enjoyable,"This novel must have been very exciting upon publication. As you can see from other reviews, the subject matter of mind control and genetic engineering is still something that excites the reader. However, the story is a bit slow moving at times and the imagery is somewhat dated. That is to be expected after thirty years. However, for true Michael Crighton fans, this will not in any way detract from enjoying his writing, which eventually would excel."
2,No stimulation here,"This is a medical thriller. While the medical stuff is quite interesting (like the idea for the novel) the thriller-stuff gives the word by-the-numbers a new meaning. Easily the least (not counting the screenplay for TWISTER) book in Crichtons otherwise impressive canon.Crichton readers expect a page-turner. This isn't one. Though one of his shortest books, it seems like his longest.p.s.: Film director Mike Hodges did a very faithful adaption of the book for the screen. He managed to caputre the boredom of the book in the film..."
3,"Interesting, but Not that Engaging","THE TERMINAL MAN is one of Crichton's earlier novels, written in 1971. It's a readable book, but not one of his best ones.The plot of this novel involves mind control, and how computers can be potentially used to control the brain. There's a lot of interesting information in this novel, but I found the plot rather plodding. Even worse, the characters are so thinly developed that I didn't really care how they turned out.Epilepsy plays a large role in the plot, and Crichton admits in a short afterward that he may have gotten certain facts wrong about the condition. This makes me wonder why this book is still in print, or hasn't been modified.All in all, THE TERMINAL MAN is okay, but you can do much better than this."
3,interesting concept,"but could have been a much better book. the science in the book seems quite believable, and the discussions on the relationship between man and machine are thought provoking. It is also quite fast paced. However the ending is lame and the characters are not developed - ellis, morris, mcpherson, ross...at times it was hard to tell one from the other. Also, there are no details on exactly how benson learns to program the implants to activate at will, it's all kept vague, so the chase for Benson holds no interest"
4,Quick and entertaining read,"This is by far not a book in the same league with Jurassic Park or The Lost World but it is an interesting book that, for some strange reason, satisfied my action craving mind. Most of the book centers around the medical area of the story but still kept me reading at full speed until the exciting ending. I liked it."
5,Great Book-Great Plot- 4 STARS! * * * *,"Although one of Crichton's first novels, this book has an interesting plot that will keep you reading for hours on end and have you in so much suspense, you will not know if Harry could be waiting at your door-step. The content inside of this book made it all the better, written in the 1970's it was extremely technologically advanced for it's time!"
4,4 1/2 Stars--Terminally Underrated,"I think that this book is extremely underrated. This is an excellent story by MC that, although a little dated, is still a compelling and exciting tale which centers on Harry Benson, a computer programmer who was hit by a car and recieved dementia and a condition where he has seizures. Seizures in which he can horribly injure or kill people. He recieves an operation in which 40 electrodes are implanted in his brain, to counterract the seizures. He discovers the electric pulses they generate are pleasurable and discovers how to get them faster, then he turns into a maniac on a killing spree. The ending was abrupt, you never find out what happens to the characters, that is my only complaint. In any case, this book is a good read that will keep you interested until the last page."
1,lame...,"I just finished this book...finally & with great disappointment. What a lame ending. I thought about not even finishing it, but kept hoping that it would get better. Well, it didn't. Many other reviewers mentioned the outdated technology, which is true, but outdated technology isn't what ruins a story, a lame story is what ruins a story. And speaking of lame, Andromeda Strain is just as bad as Terminal Man. If you want suspense & action, read Jurassic Park & The Lost World."
2,The ending ruined the whole stinkin' book,"I thought it took quite a while for this book to get started and I thought it was okay until the end. For me it seemed like Chricton was eager to finish this book and get on with his next novel wich was ""the great train robbery"". If you want to chat about this IM me at my E-mail adress.I read this in one day becase when it got good illt was hard for me to stop."
3,A question in bioethics.,"This novel, also made into a film (in 1974), deals with the effects and morals of electronic implants being attached in the brain of a man who has a behavioral disorder. The implants are supposed to control any anti-social or violent behavior by sending an electrical impulse to the brain's ""pleasure"" center. But, the results are unexpected when the patient discovers that he can get the impulse on demand. There are villains in this novel not usually mentioned: the physicians who set up and performed the procedure on the main character. The neurologists and neurosurgeons clearly had not done the necessary preliminary studies before the procedure was to be attempted on a human. This is a major topic of discussion in bioethics even today."
3,Could have been better,"I feel this book could have been better. I have read many other of Micheal Crichton books and he is by far my favorite writer, I just feel that this book had to much scientific stuff for the average reader to follow. Especially if its thier first time reading one of his books. Again I dont think its his best, and the characters could have been better formed. The ending needed some work also."
4,A review of Terminal Man by Michael Crichton,"This was a great book despite the ending. At the end, it seemed as if Michael Crichton couldn't think of what to write, so he just ended there. Terminal Man is about a man named Harry Benson that has violent brain seizures in which he loses control of himself and does horrible acts of violence. He participates in an experimental surgery to implant electrodes into his brain to send pleasurable shocks to stop the seizures before they start. At first, the surgery was a success. But, Benson soon discovered a way to increase the frequency of his seizures, causing more impulses of pleasure. He escaped form the hospital and went insane from the constant shocks. He became murderous and bent on stopping his delusion of computers taking over the world from happening. A very good, suspensful thriller."
5,realistic,"Crichton does great job of conveying a sense of realism. The annotated bibliography that is present in one of the older editions of the book adds to this realism, as the articles cited actually do exist."
3,An OK one of Crichton's,"I always forget this book when I recall all MC's books I've read. Probably because it wasn't the best. But it wasn't the worst either. It was actually sort of creepy and I wouldn't recommend reading it at night, but it was good and did not include billions of technical details like some OTHER Michael Crichton books I've read *cough cough ""Andromeda Strain""* I liked it because it had a female as the main character and I like when MC does that. :-) A pretty good book."
3,thrilling but a lot of bad language,"this book was superbly written and kept me at the edge of my seat,but some where in the middle it loses its hold and goes wayward,with great difficulty micheal gets his story on the right track but i guess it is too late to get 5 on 5. any way worth reading."
3,Worth it if you've got some time,"This book was pretty good, but what a let down in the end. Go for it if you've got some time, but if you want to read just the top books out there, this isn't the one"
3,Not his best,"I am a huge fan of Crichton, but I felt that this one wasn't his best book. It had a great storyline, and was well written, but I felt it was a little boring, slow, and the ending was terrible. I'll give it only three stars instead of one because I do like Crichton."
3,Starts slow but picks up a lot of speed,The first 75 pages or so didn't interest me a lot but when he escapes from the hospital the tension mounts and keeps the reader hooked and has a cliffhanger of an ending. To bad they made this into a movie because it SUCKED! Don't even bother with it but the book is worth a look.
2,Crichton's Worst,"I usually love Crichton's books, especially Disclosure and Jurassic Park, but this one was horrible and predictable."
3,An OK book.,"Sphere was a book that I loved, so next a tried Chrichton's Terminal Man. This book is not nearly as good. The first half of this book is a tad dull, unless your into neuro-psycology or anything like this. But as you move on, it gets more exciting. This book, I would not suggest purchasing. I'd take it from a library."
2,dreadful,"Perhaps this book appeared to be a futuristic medical thriller when it first came out, but now it seems like a bad 1950s horror movie. The story involves brain surgery gone bad, with a mix of artificial intelligence and mind control. The end of the story was very predictable and played out exactly as I suspected from the very beginning of the book."
2,Very Dissapionting,"After reading Jurassic Park, I was eager to read this one. Big mistake. It sounded good and was reviewed great too. But it was terrible. If you like SLOW books, you may like this one. I sure did not, though. I give it two stars just because of the ending."
2,Doesn't fulfill the promise,"A shameful book beside Crichton's other works, which are collectively brilliant, The Terminal Man never quite achieves the ambitious plot the book's jacket would have us believe, and sadly, the book does not even become a failure until the inciting moment, when Benson escapes. Crichton cranks out the usual amount of suspense and action throughout the entire exposition, including a very memorable computer ""discussion"" sequence. But Benson's haunting about Los Angeles never seems quite as scary a prospect as it should be, and the ending should be ripped from its binding. Crichton is my favorite author, and I count some of his books as among the finest I know, but The Terminal Man sits on my shelf next to Sphere, Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain, and Rising Sun, and it pales before them all. A modern-day Frankenstein? If you've ever read Shelley's, you know that it wasn't that great, either."
1,Not even up to Crichton standards.,I usually enjoy Micheal Crichton very much. This book was boring and not worth the money.
2,worst yet from crichton (that i read),"it was extremely boring to start and it dragged on and on. but i had to read it for school, well i chose it hoping it would be good....so i continued. it picked up when benson went on his rampage but a bad ending like congo... and go figure he has a gigantic bibliography like in congo. he researches a little to much i think and it takes away from the book, just an opinion. in final...it could have been way better"
3,Pretty Decent for an out of Date book on old Technology,"The biggest problem I had with this was the ending. It reminded me of the ending of ""An American Werewolf in London."" You know, Boom with gun"" falls, the end. I would have liked a little more closure...more on what had happened to the characters and stuff.Other than the out of date technology it was pretty good for the short book it is. Pretty good idea. His Timeline and Eaters of the Dead are still his best.\ though."
3,"A fun, fast read","We follow the character of Harry Benson in ""The Terminal Man"". Harry has a medical problem where he blacks out and turns violent. To help him, Doctors decided to put a computer in his brain to send soothing waves to him to help him settle. But what happens when he learns to control the computer?This is Michael Crichtons second book under his real name. It is pretty short, I read it in one afternoon and it was able to keep me reading.I found that the ending was a bit lame, but other than that, I wanted to know what happened next and then more, throughout the book. It is a fun read that will keep you company on a boring day of snow or rain.I gave the book three stars mainly because of its length and the ending. I thought Crichton could do a bit better."
3,The work of a fledgling novelist,"The best I can say about this book is that it showcases how Crichton's ability to write thrillers has improved with age. Some aspects of the novel are noticeably clunky due to the passage of time since it was written, but I don't hold this against Crichton. Works in his chosen genre are expected to make goofy extrapolations from present-day events; the bemusement with which we can view them in later decades is just another (albeit belated) part of the fun.""The Terminal Man"" is most seriously marred by its conventional and abrupt ending, with nary a sentence of denouement. There is also a brief subplot about two misbehaving AI programs that appears only long enough to turn on the allegorical neon sign before vanishing. However, despite these flaws, it is a fun read."
3,Not what it could have been,"If They had half stars it would be 2 and 1/2 stars.I bought this when it first came out and maybe I'm the only one, but I didn't buy it for Lou Gramm. Although I am a fan Foreginers first 4 albums they pretty much hit the pop/rock ballad road after that which I don't care for.I bought this for Vivian Campbell. I liked his work with Dio and was hoping to hear Gramms voice with a hard rocking edge to it again. I was dissapointed. While the album is not horrible it is in the vein of Foreigners later work."
1,Foreigner Front Man Lou Gramm's Semi-Solo Outing,"I used to be a big fan of Foreigner back in the day and I picked this up during one of their break-up phases for about 5 bucks. Lou Gramm is just as good as he always is, backed by very ho-hum music. The only decent track worth hearing, in my opinion, is the last one, Russia. And that, only if you are a major Lou Gramm fan. For a couple of bucks, it's probably worth it for that one song. Again, only if you are really enthused about Lou."
3,touch pad mini keyboard,"We bought this to replace a full size ergonomic keyboard from another manufacturer. I like the full sized combined ergonomic touchpad keyboards and the left touchpad input button went bad.We originally paid about $30 for the last full size one. Now they retail for about $80 before shipping. So much for tech getting cheaper.This was an emergency purchase and we bought it because we needed it yesterday and it was the cheapest touchpad keyboard replacement. We also bought a cheap backup USB mouse.This USB keyboard size and keys are small to tiny, as for a child. Besides the learn curve, it is different layout and no numberpad. It did intall, plug and play well. Keys suffer long stroke and mushiness. We will keep using this produce as the input and replace it soon with a full size ergonomic touchpad keyboard at a reasonable price. This one will fit nicely upright, next to the dictionary, on the bookshelf for emergency."
3,"Pattern is striking, but quality is questionable...","I liked the styling of this set to a point I looked at no others, but I noticed that sets I have seen on display, as well as mine, have wobbles in the lines. The large plates in my set are fine, but one saucer and all of the cups have slight, but noticeable wobbles in the line patterns. One would think the quality checking would catch those. I did not bother to send it back since I fear they all will have this.Also, I noticed on the ones in display at Bed, Bath & Beyond had a chip on one or two, so I have long term doubts about Mikasa's claim of ""chip-resistant"".... Also, BB&B; advertised these as for ""oven warming only"", so I am also leary of Mikasa's claim of ""dishwasher to oven""... (ah, yes, but what temperature...) Anyway , I was tired of stoneware and paper plates..."
5,A Great Budget CD If You Need Frank With Dorsey,"If you have a good Tommy Dorsey collection but it is short on Sinatra sides, this fits the bill quite nicely to help fill in the gaps. I might complain that it is missing ""East of The Sun"", but that is minor for the fact you get most of the cream from their collaberation together."
1,Did not hold,Tried two different times. Bought Permatex twice. Applied it as per directions twice. It fell off twice. Is there anything that will hold better?
4,it works but!,"my windshield was replaced about a year ago and the mirror just fell off. I found this permatex stuff and ordered two. the first one I followed the directions exactly, but when cleaning the glass I used a alcohol swab towelette first. then I applied the glue swab towelette and glued the button on the glass. it set for several hours and when I put the mirror on it took just one adjustment of the mirror and it fell off. with the next one I just used the swab towelette and put a bigger drop of glue and voila. the mirror stuck on and is still doing its job watching my rear."
1,Couldn't Get it to Work,I could not get it to work. I thought I followed the directions correctly. I will try again with another product.
4,Worked well on my mirror,"If you follow the directions, the product works perfetly. The primer leaves little bit of haze on the glass which I was able to remove with window cleaner AFTER I glued the metal piece to the windshield."
1,Failed - Two times - two kits,"I went as far as scraping all the old adhesive off from the windshield and everything was done to the letter of the instructions. The mirror mount came off the glass as I was placing the mirror on. The glue stuck the the metal mount quite nicely, but that doesn't help when you end up holding the mount after if fell off from the glass. I thought maybe I messed something up and tried a second package, same result. I'm now looking for an alternative.I ended up going to O'Realy's and picking up their brand. So far so good."
1,What a joke,"I have used a total of 3 of these kits. Followed the instructions each time and then about a week later, the mirror is lying on the car floor. Product does not work, unless you only want your mirror to stay in place for a week or less."
2,Nope.,"Excellent craftsman; obsessively prepared surfaces.Did NOT hold.It seems many smart people like myself did *not* have success with the product, yet many others did (possibly both smart and..not so smart people alike), so obviously there are unknown technical factors/variables at play, and YMMV. (For anyone to say at this point whether it absolutely works or not in all cases is just pure ignorance and insanity.)User 'MTM' had the most useful review IMO, so I will try the Permatex 84101 he suggested as this is the second ""rear view mirror kit"" product that's epically failed for me."
1,Does not work.,"I have tried all the permatex mirror adhesives, and none of them have held for more than an hour. I have tried cleaning the glass with alcohol and acetone, and it did not help adhesion. 2 of the tries failed so badly that when i tried to snap the mirror onto the button, it pulled the button off like it wasn't there and continued downward to put holes in my dashboard. I have been told this stuff has a short shelf life, so I may have gotten stale product. The Loctite kit I used previously lasted for 5 years in the same vehicle, and I put it on the same way. Too bad they stopped making it."
1,PATHETIC WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS ITEM PRECISELY. MOUNTED MY MIRROR AND THE SECOND I TOUCHED IT IT FELL RIGHT OFF... THE ADHESIVE JUST PLAIN DIDNT WORK.. ""ITEM IS HAZARDOUS"" SO NO RETURN OR REFUND IS AVAILABLE.... BUY THIS STUFF FROM YOUR LOCAL AUTO PARTS PLACE OR BUY IT TWICE. BAD BAD BAD AMAZON. SHAME ON YOU FOR SELLING THIS."
2,the kids in the audience were more bored than i was!!!,"this video was TERRIBLE! why did i view it, you might ask? COMPLETELY BY MISTAKE!!! i was doing a paper for school on children's reading techniques... let's just say this offered little to no help, though i MUST say the snoothy guzzlesmort did provide for EMBARASSING comic relief. (not that THAT would be ANY reason why ANY OF YOU should EVER view this horrid thing!) BETTER, if you're ever thinking of watching this, do THIS: Cash your paycheck, pay your bills, and with what is left over, flush it DIRECTLY down the toilet, thus cutting out the middle man... HEY, you'll be more satisfied in the end!!!"
1,Makes You Want to Shoot Yourself!,"I absolutely found this book repugnant. The illustractions are frightening and grim. In fact Figure 3.1 a wicked line drawing of a ""pink puffer and a blue bloater"" looks like a dark ages depiction of hell. Everyone with COPD knows we are going to die and that we are going to die younger than our cohorts. At fifty-five and having been diagnosed at forty, this book temporarily robbed me of any hope to lead an even worthwhile life. This was all compounded by the once again grotesque illustrations by Kenneth Axen. Far better and more hopeful is the ""Courage"" book that offers a story of hope, dignity, and the ability to cope. As a licensed psychotherapist I actually think the ""Handbook"" could be psychologically damaging to some patients. Since depression and anxiety go hand in hand with COPD, the ""in your face"" approach to this book is best to be avoided"
4,Batman for Leapster,"A little wordy in the beginning, but 4 year old grandson knows to click past the story content if he is ready to play the game."
3,Not the best leapster,Batman wasn't a great choice for leapster - it is better left to the nintendo ds. The graphics can't compare to the vidceo games of ds or tv console games. Leapster games should be kept strictly educational for the less tech savvy preschoolers.
3,inaccurate age rating,"The rating by Leapster is 4 to 8 years old, and amazon puts it at 5 to 7 years old. Who are these people giving this age rating - marketing? As a grandparent, I prefer the more informative ESRB rating. This game MIGHT get the E rating (6 years and older) because it contains cartoon violence (child has to punch/kick enemies) but might also get the more strict E10+ rating because of frequency of violence:""Titles rated E (Everyone) have content that may be suitable for ages 6 and older. Titles in this category may contain minimal cartoon, fantasy or mild violence and/or infrequent use of mild language.""""Titles rated E10+ (Everyone 10 and older) have content that may be suitable for ages 10 and older. Titles in this category may contain more cartoon, fantasy or mild violence, mild language and/or minimal suggestive themes."""
5,If you fish . . .,"If you fish for trout, using a fly floating on top of the water, you will love this book.If you're not a dry fly fisherman, you might just become one after reading this book."
4,Worth the price just for three songs alone,"1. That Petrol Emotion doing ""Stories of the Street""2. A raucous ""Don't Go Home With Your Hard-on"" by David McComb and Adam Peters3. The now classic version of ""Hallelujah"" by John Cale.Like many tribute albums, this has its down moments (REM sounds like a self-parody here) and its mediocre moments (Lloyd Cole does a ""nothing to write home about"" version of ""Chelsea Hotel""). But most of these tracks give us different, often intriguing interpretations of some superb music. The fact that they can withstand these differing perspectives certainly speaks to the integrity and overall excellence of these songs."
4,Fantastic if you like Leonard Cohen or a few of these bands.,Tribute albums are always a mixed bag but the standard of material makes this listenable right the way through. The massive highlight for me is the Pixies doing 'I can't forget' in a true Pixies style and making it sound for all the world like it's always been their song - and one of their best songs at that. Truely breathtaking. If you like the Pixies and haven't heard this song buy the c.d. - it's worth it (and the rest is pretty good too!)John Cale's cover of 'Hallelujah' is a real unexpected gem while James mix up the lyrics on 'So Long Marianne' but come out on top and House of Love do a luxurious 'Who by Fire'. REM are disappointing with a really unadventurous plod through 'First we take Manhattan' - I anticipated a much more interesting interprettation from them.If you like Leonard Cohen or some of the bands here it's definitely worth getting - even the lesser covers don't damage some wonderful songs.
3,not the best cd in the world,"i got this as a gift, and since i enjoy leonard cohen music, i expected to enjoy this too, it's wasn't too dissapointed, but most of the interpetations to his songs are either trying to sounds just like leonard cohen or just too strange or unfit to the songs in my eyes.if anyone's looking to a good introduction to leonard cohen, i suggest ""the best of"" or just spending your money on any other leonard cohen cd, in this case i think, the sorce's still much superiour to the reflection, yes, the nick cave interpetation is great, but it doesn't justify getting the whole cd."
3,Disappointed,"With great excitement I gave this shirt to my husband for Christmas. He's quite a fan of Hawaii and very interested in the air force bombers. His dad flew in one. He was very excited too.It fit well and my husband was happy with it. However the shirt, after being worn a few times, tore at the seam for some unknown reason and is impossible to sew."
2,Wrong item,"I ordered this for my father since he likes air force planes, was very dissapointed to receive a shirt totally different from the one pictured : ( it didn't even have a single airplane bomber as stated. I orderedanother one in hopes of receiving the correct shirt this time!! So hopefully it was just a packing error."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,It is colored water and had no vanilla flavor so I returned it.Tone's Imitation Vanilla - 64oz plastic jug
2,Electric Schlock!,"I found a fairly nice sound from a group called Trafik, but was having a hard time finding their label. These ""Electric Calm"" compositions kept popping up and I ended up accepting the Amazon offer of more than one at a minor discount. I have not been overly impressed. The sounds on all of these comps. are stagnate, high-treble electro-whispers with bass dubs that go nowhere. Electronic music is a tough act since, anyone with a casio can say they make music. I guess I demand more from artists purporting to understand their medium.If all you are interested is mind-jelly, this is it. It will calm you, or numb you."
2,No Fuses,"This item does not come with fuses or the screws needed to mount it. It's not the sellers fault, the manufacturer does not include them in the retail package. Look else where for one that has them included or you'll just be running to Radio shack or Best buy like i had to."
3,Good info,"A lot if this book is about Franco's life. While his life is interesting I was looking for some more inside information or his own personal nutritional habits. There are a lot of good charts on bioavailability and what not, but I was just a bit underwhelmed. He was a champion level bodybuilder and has a PHD in nutrition so I guess I had extremely high expectations that this good but not great book did not meet."
3,good but needs to be updated,"franco gives good advice and certainly has all the credentials to write this book. But he neglects all the modern protein powders, supplements like creatine in this book. Simply states its better to eat natural protein like eggs, fish and meat. No review of whey or casein or creatine. But I guess he did become a Mr. Olympia without all that. For those wanting to avoid supplements this may be ok. Other than that it has good advice."
2,Nice for Novice,"I liked the book, but I am a rookie who has little to no experience. It was a quick read that only raised more questions for me. Veteran body builders won't like it much as I have found that they already know most of the topics in the book. One thing did put me off. I found it hard to believe the statement in the section on steroids that he (Columbu) didn't know about steroids when he first won the Mr. O the first time. I shared this with a fitness news group (MFW) and several people also found it hard to believe."
2,1980s information,"I am a big fan of Franco and that is why I bought the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. The information is the same I used unsuccessfully in the 80's. Better books include Every Thing You Need to Know About Fat Loss by Chris Aceto, Extreme Muscle Enhancement by Carlon Colker, and Bodysculpting Bible for Men (sorry authors don't have the book handy at this time)."
1,kitchenaid 10 pc set blue,"ordered this set, it was described as having a 11"", 4 1/4 qt covered saute pan , its a 10"" 3 qt covered saute pan that comes with this set, reordered it and got the same set, they still havent corrected this description."
5,great product!!!!!!!!1,I ordered this set through Amazon before Christmas. It by far exceeded by expectations...... The set has a good weight and feel. Cooking and clean up is absolutely a breeze! I have owned several brands of cookware in the past that were FAR MORE expensive but seriously..this set is better than the more expensive cookware sets that I own. It is the first one I reach for in my cabinets. The handles are awesome!!!!!!!! I can't say enough about the value of this set of cookware.
5,"1969 on the moon, 2008 wow the new iPhone","There's something about the whole Apollo project that makes you wonder, when you really consider it, whether we peaked in 1969."
1,lemon,I am a finish carpenter who owns one dozen pneaumatic nail/staple guns by five different manufacturers. This gun was an expensive disappointment. It jambs all the time (and they are time consuming to clear). It constantly folds nails over (does not matter which brand you are driving). It has been in the shop for repairs more than it has been on the job.The last time I went to pick it up from the repair shop I insisted on testing the the tool myself before paying. I fired about 1/3 of a clip and bent six brads. The repairman scartched his head and now I must purchase a replacement gun so I can perform my job.
4,Great Cheesy Fun!! A perfect beach book.,For a first novel this was very good. It moved along at a quick pace and was very enjoyable read. This could be given to kids over the age of 10 becuase there are no scenes of sex or graphic violence. I will be lending this out to friends
1,DO NOT Select 'Natural Selection'!,"I went off the cover for this turkey expecting something along the lines of the Meg series by Steve Alten. Nope. Heres the rub ...no sharks. No , just giant manta rays that 'learn' to 'adapt' and breathe air AND fly! If you can wrap your brain around that then perhaps this is the book for you. I found it a complete waste of time and money. I was 100 pages from the end and I just didn't care how it ended."
5,This was a very scary book!,This was a very scary book! What made it so scary was how real the new species seemed. I could see it just like in real life. Before I read this my family took a trip to a outdoor park. We saws bears and elk and tigers. The new species in Natural Selection was called a demonray and it seemed just as real as they did. That is very scary to me. This animal seems like it is real. Two of my friends are reading the book at camp.
1,NOT a good book,"My husband found this book at the local Dollar Store, so thankfully not much was lost on this purchase. The writing is horrendous. Head-hopping among the characters constantly. Too much of the adverb ""suddenly"" which is jarring, poor dialogue, inept descriptions, and a plot and sub-plots that are...boring. And yes, you know what's going to happen before it even happens, thanks to too much foreshadowing with the prologue and in each chapter.How did this get picked up by Hyperion Publisher? It was his debut novel, so the vetting at that stage of the game is excellent. Or should be.Dave Freedman really needed to have a good editor tear it apart. But I doubt even that could save this book."
3,Exciting but improbable,"I realize this is a work of fiction, but even as fiction, it really stretched credibility. The creatures themselves were definitely menacing and the author did a great job creating visuals of the animal, but most of the ""science"" around them, to try to explain their abilities was just a bit too hard to believe. And then the human characters...not everyone that ever served in the military is a superhuman killing machine. And no one can fire arrows as fast as the Darryl Hollis character is described doing.And a final word on the physical layout of the book itself... to the publisher, please don't use a size 6 font for a 400 page novel."
1,Unintelligently designed book,"I wanted to like this book because it combines science fiction (one of my favorite genres) with oceanography and marine biology (my favorite science, next to astronomy). I really, really wanted to like this book; it looked like a decent weekend read. But, to paraphrase Roger Ebert, this book sucks.The scientific facts that are commonly present in sci-fi books are missing here. The author didn't do his homework in marine biology and it shows, unfortunately. He also didn't do his homework in basic writing and this is probably why the book has 13 chapters of little more than characters conversing. The opening of Jaws at least introduced you to the title character and had action.The book takes itself way too seriously, which is why it's not a fun read (like Steve Alten's Meg series) and in my opinion, it's not worth buying. If you're bored, check it out from the library. But check to see if one of Alten's book is also available and, if so, read that."
3,Good first effort,"The subject and the story held my interest, but it was fairly easy to tell that Freedman has never written a story before. As the Washington Post reviewer indicates, the story jumps far too often from one point of view to another, and his sentence structure is atrocious.Still, the story is a nail-biter in spite of these flaws and one hopes that his next book (if there is one) will show an improvement."
2,Why the positive hype?,"I've read numerous books of this type over the years since JAWS was first published.This book, at best, is a good way to waste time, which could have been spent reading something else, perhaps re-reading JAWS.It started on a fairly good note, but didn't quite hold together until the end. Not a terrible read, but I expected something a bit different."
1,Great book to read before bed! I dozed right off! Zzzzzz!!!!!,"This book is so bad I couldn't even finish it. I was looking for something to read while waiting for the new Preston/ Child book this Spring. I bought the book based on the reviews here. Thankfully I only bought the one, and didn't waste any more money on his other books.This book is a real snooze! The comparisons on the cover to Jaws or Jurassic are laughable! I stopped reading at chapter 23, pg. 110 and there has been zero suspense, terror, mayhem, and about one drop of blood. This guy knows NOTHING about grabbing the reader and keeping them interested. At this point, I don't even care what happens next. Save your money. Awful is too good to describe this book. It will put you to sleep though!"
2,Fun - Odd - Scary - Hoot,"Fun story. But a story nonetheless. What I want to know is why people always think there are penguins in the northern hemisphere. He makes a reference thereto, sad so sad. Ha ha."
3,"Good idea, hurt by average pacing...","By now, writers should assume that unless they keep the pace up, readers will have too much time to roll their eyes at the stock characters and silly dialogue.This book has a great idea (however farfetched) too bad the pace isn't more brisk.Neither boring, nor slow, I recommend it as a beach read, but you can definitely put it down once in a while to go play volleyball.That said, I will read Freedman's next book in the hopes he learns tighter pacing."
2,Implausible appliies to every aspect of this book,"I didn't buy this book thinking it was a great piece of fiction. However, parts of it were so stupid that it was hard to continue. I couldn't really remember who 3 of the main characters were, and the rest were really pretty one dimensional and not exciting.The book wasn't complete crap but close. I would say it had it's entertaining in parts but the believability factor is just so out there.Besides that, there are so many clueless characters (including a forest ranger couple who go looking for a hiker with their baby but the mother doesn't bring any baby supplies like bottles or diapers, BUT BRINGS A BABY SWING and leaves her kid in a tree trunk [don't ask], a couple of color where one is part native American and therefore has mystical powers of some kind but will only help if money involved, and the list goes on.mildly diversion. stuck with it to the end only because i had committed so much to it."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I started it, but I couldn't finish it. These kinds of books are right up my alley, but I could only make it to about page 100. All the things mentioned by other reveiwers (poor sentence structure, cheesy dialogue, etc.) just made me regret the purchase. The cover, which is what caught my eye initially, was good. However, I fell prey to the old adage, you can't judge a book by its cover. Sorry."
2,Interesting at best-if you know nothing of science,"I have no problem suspending a certain amount of scientific belief in the creation of a monster creature, but I do need the author to get basic facts right. Crichton has some ""out there"" ideas, but the supporting science is there, especially in regard to the non-monster info. Raccoons aren't rodents, great whites can't dive 4 miles, and how are a bunch of phd's that stupid and lazy? If you don't care about this, or are completely oblivious to all things science, go ahead. This book should be mildly entertaining. Everyone else, don't bother."
4,Great beach read...,"This is your a-typical summer popcorn beach read. While not very scientific, it does provide an exhilarating read! Most enjoyable reading while at the beach watching the surf roll in."
3,"Wince, wince!","Dave Freedman has come up with an exciting plot with scientific explanations that left my head spinning. All right...I'm a humanist and Mr. Freedman has impressive academic credentials. So I was both relieved and diappointed to see that others who obviously followed those details better than I did found them wanting. There's nothing wrong with the plot in terms of imagination and pace but some of the awkward sentences made me wonder where the editor was. It also occurred to me that this is a major investment on the publisher's part: to publish a first book that's over 400 pages long. But if they're looking for Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code audience maybe they'll find them. (I'm almost afraid to admit I put Brown's book down after 50 pages because I couldn't endure the writing style.) Believe me, I'm not a snob - I do read pot boilers and ""beach reads"" but they have to be decently written. Perhaps Mr. Freedman will learn from this book and demand more editorial assistance on the next one."
1,Bilge...with stereotypes galore!,"A previous reviewer rightly points out the authors poor treatment of the two Black characters in this book with awful stereotypes. This is just so blatant that, in my opinion, it leaves no doubt as to what the authors views on Black people are. Leaving that aside, the book is simply not that entertaining and better science and story is to be had from 'Fragment' by Warren Fahy, a superior book in all respects and without the racist stereotypes. Readers may also wish to check out authors such as Scott Sigler and James Rollins."
3,Perfect for a slow weekend,"Ok, as many others have pointed out, this is not a literary classic by any length. But if you take it for what it is: a fast-paced, action-oriented, natural-horror, dumb sci-fi book, it's ok. It was a fast read and once I started, I couldn't put it down until I finished it.All in all, I would say that if you can overlook inaccuracies on the science and facts of the book, and also the poor attempt at a romance subplot between a couple of characters, it's a good enough book to get you through a slow weekend. I would definitely recommend it to sci-fi and natural horror fans, if not as a book to keep, at least as one to pass around."
5,Fantastic!,"Very intelligent view of a possible change in evolution. This book deserves far more notoriety. I could say more but I'd just be regurgitating what others have already said here.If you get a chance to read this book, take it."
4,good quick read,"I agree with others that the science in this book is questionable at best. In theory, the demonrays are plausible. Could something like that fly? I think not. However, this is a book of FICTION. If one tries not to get too haute about knowing more science than the author, one can actually enjoy this book, which starts out as a rolling drama and crescendos into a rather scary horror story.I've been in science all my life and know animals well, since that is my job, but I enjoyed this book as just a good quick read. Might be a bit scary to read on the beach though. And that last statement is coming from a snorkeller! :)"
4,"Wanted to comment 100 pages ago, couldn't put it down","Talk about a fast-moving thriller. Natural Selection was a rush in every sense of the word. The editing was poor - and hence why I did not give five stars- but we can't blame poor editing on the author, Mr. Freedman. Everything else about this book was fantastic. The concept, the plot, the brilliant science and the highly visual imagery were just a few of my favorite features. There was so much more fantastic stuff but I can't recall it all here. What a great, fun read, truly amazing work."
3,ehhhh.......,"A nice read, but uneven in places. Took me less than an evening to read. With work would have made a better novel. Good story idea but needs more depth. However, if you're sitting in a beach chair go for it, you'll like it."
5,"Fun, fast and exciting ---",This story moves very fast and is hard to put down. I don't know if the science is real or fake but I found it compelling and very interesting. The action scenes are incredible; the characters are pretty good too. Read this; much better than any of the other commercial stuff I've seen in a long time. It's a fun one.
5,Great with steaks!,"I learned about this spice blend from one of my favorite lunch spots that has a terrific grilled steak lunch special. Being a regular, the owner let me in on ""the secret"". It was Tone's Canadian Steak Seasoning. Just sprinkle it on and press it into both sides and grill. Its great at enhancing flavor and adding some ""garlic bite"". But be careful to not put on too much, it is chock full of flavor.I also make a marinade for shish-kabobs with it adding red wine vinegar and olive oil. This has become a well-loved family favorite. I haven't yet tried it on other foods. It is so ideally suited for beef I feel it might be too much for chicken, shrimp, or other lighter meats. But on steaks... it is The Bomb... highly recommended!"
5,My favorite seasoning - EVER,"We use this on everything - steak, chops, chicken, fish, eggs - you name it! No additional salt or pepper required, great in fresh guacamole and salsa! I was disturbed to find that Sam's Club no longer carries it, but glad to see it hasn't disappeared. Am going to try one more place locally, and if they don't have it, Amazon, here I come! None of my food tastes quite right without it!"
5,Tone's Steak Seasoning,"Bought several of these for our friends in eastern europe. They Love it. they picked the Tones Seasoning up last time in the us. Difficult to find in most of the stores, have to get one for myself."
5,great all around seasoning,Love this seasoning. Twice a week I throw some boneless skinless chicken breasts in my crockpot and sprinkle with Tones Canadian Steak Seasoning. We chunk it and eat it on top of baby greens with other fresh vegetables. Also great for sandwiches and on nachos. Also makes a great seasoning burgers.........grilled or panfried.
3,This was just Ok for me,"I first tasted this seasoning on meat at Sam's Club. If you go to Sam's on Saturday you know ALL the samples taste good.Anyways, it was just ok when I got it home and tried it on stuff. The spices are coarsley ground which is cool. It has a nice garlic flavor. But, it's easy to over season with this stuff. There is some kind of seed in the mix and I think that has a wang to it. I'm not sure what kind of seed because the ingredient info is on the label is printed in French. I like the Durkee Steak Dust much better."
4,Excellent music for babies & kids!,"""Mommy & Me"" cds are excellent for kids - from newborns up to kindergarten. The music is up-beat and fun. The songs are great for dancing, singing along, and developing your child's language. Highly recommended!"
1,Horrible and unbiblical,"I was just given this book by a friend, and boy am I disheartened. My husband and I used to hold to Word of Faith doctrines (we came out of a Kenneth-Hagin-following church) and now I am just weary of these false teachings and sad for those who believe (like we used to) that they can ""speak things into existence"" through ""positive confession."" Or that they can have a pain-free life (including childbearing), and if they have pain in their lives, it is their fault for not having enough faith. These teachings are simply untrue.Although they sound liberating (""childbirth without pain? sign me up!""), in fact they produce more anxiety, because if you do suffer, then you are, like Job, blamed for it. No, sometimes, we suffer in life, and sometimes it's not our fault.I am going to pray that God gives me a trouble-free pregnancy and labor, but if that does not happen, I will trust Him anyway. Not my faith. Not my words. Him."
3,"Good Content, Horrible Kindle Formatting","My wife asked me to read this book in preparation for starting our own family. The content was inspiring. I've decided do my best to be a husband like Terry (Jackie Mize's husband). I will stand by her and pray with her for a supernatural childbirth.With all that said, I do want to say that the Kindle format sucks: words and sentences are out of place, paragraphs run together, and there are no real chapter sepearations. Let's just say it was good thing my wife had the paperback version. It helped me to read the parts that were too jacked up. Save your patience; buy a paperback version."
1,Poorly disguised prosperity doctrine,"Contrary to all other reviews published, I found this book to be most unhelpful. It basically talked about childbirth & conception as commodities that God 'wants' us to have. While I'm sure that God is good & blesses us richly, this book simply is western capitalism revisited in another form. I'm really glad that others found the book inspiring, but to me it seemed very much along the lines of 'God is a vending machine, there to give you everything you want'. There was no suggestion that sometimes there is no earthly resolution. If you believe in the God who answers all prayers with a yes, buy this book. If you believe that God is a loving, merciful & suffering God who connects with people in their suffering but does not always give us what we want, then read the book of Job instead."
5,I loved this book,"A friend bought me this book. Unlike what some have said Jesus died for our sins, and our curses, all of them not just some of them. So yes you can have a Supernatural childbirth. I had a great pregnancy and delivery with my son. I arrived at the hospital at 7:20am sat in the waiting room for over 30 minutes. When they finally checked me after 8am; I was at 9 cm. My son was born at 9:05am on April 5th 2004. I pushed for less than 10 minutes. It was pain free and the most beautiful thing I have ever experinced in my life. Not eveyone will have the same experince that I did, but reading this book can build your faith in more ways than you can imagine. Through CHRIST JESUS all things are possible even a fast pain free labor.Tricia BarkerMakakilo, Hawaii"
4,Great book for Christian women.,"I'm about halfway through with the book. It is not the best written book, but it does speak a lot of truth and reveals a lot about God's word about childbirth. We depend on him for everything else, but when it comes to childbirth we just seem to accept what the culture says -- it is painful, long -- but worth every moment! But this is not what God's word teaches us. It is definitely an easy read and I would recommend it."
5,Great Book,So glad that this book was recommended to me - and thankful that I am able to take in this teaching before I deliver.
4,I liked it,"I liked this book. Even though I'm not one to be too worried about pain-free childbirth since I'm all about my epidural and have my babies in 3 hours, but I think the principles about healing are very applicable and I did pray over my daughter before she was conceived and saw evidence of everything I prayed for. Not that it would have really mattered if she had different hair color or eye color or anything like that. Wouldn't have mattered to me if she had been a boy instead of the girl prayed for. But after two (amazing) boys with blond & then red hair and then two very tragic miscarriages it was so sweet to get my little dark haired, blue eyed, completely healthy and perfect little baby girl like my heart desired. She is now 10 months old and is such a joy to our entire family. She has exactly the disposition I prayed for as well. We have another baby on the way, it will be interesting to see what happens with this sweet one <3"
2,Really?,"This is a story about one woman's experience with bearing children. I felt her answer to everything was to pray about it, which isn't bad but she didn't really offer any other advice. There were 2 parts that I found hard to take seriously... 1. She wanted her third child to be a girl, so she prayed for a girl and that's what she got. I think that is a selfish thing to pray for. 2. She didn't want to be induced so when her care provider scheduled an induction she prayed that she would go into labor before her appointment. I think that it was irresponsible for her to not seek out a care provider who is against unnecessary induction, if that's the way she felt... In the end this book just wasn't for me. I wanted more practical advice on how to birth naturally. Personally, I really like Ina May's Guide to Childbirth by Ina May Gaskin and Hypnobirthing by Marie Mongan, which teaches relaxation techniques."
5,Life Changing Pregnany Book,"My husband and I are planning on starting a family soon, and a friend of my read this books during her pregnancy and recommended it to us. It's packed full of logical information and guidance from Scripture about pregnancy. It puts pregnancy and childbirth in a whole new light. This book is a must for anyone who is pregnant or planning on having children!"
5,A Must-Have for Expectant Christian Moms,"I bought this book when I was pregnant with my second child and on bedrest for preterm labor. Having just suffered two miscarriages, I was filled with fear and felt robbed of the joy of pregnancy. This book helped me release my fears and trust in God's plan. By using the scripture references and daily prayers included in this book I grew confident of my ability to deliver a full-term, healthy baby. My faith increased and I connected with my child in my womb.Although my first child was delivered after a 20 hour labor (with benefit of drugs and an epidural), I began to look forward to labor. This book affirmed that God didn't intend for my labor to be difficult. While it wasn't pain-free by any means my labor was perfect. It was only 4 hours, I felt in control the whole time, and I delivered a healthy baby girl without any drugs at all - on my due date no less!I recommend this book to anyone who is pregnant or is planning to conceive."
5,Loved it!,Yeowww! catnip toys are great. My 4 cats just love these and they got them for Christmas and they are still dragging it out of their toy box. We will probably buy more of these for next Christmas. Highly recommend!
5,This is the BIG Apple...,"If your cat ignores the teensy weensy type of cat toys and wants something to really sink his teeth *and claws!* into... get the BIG apple... not only is it stuffed with great catnip, but the fabric is a heavy duty quality that holds up well to cat-fight-play...He just loves the Yeowwww! line of toys, I've ordered the lemon (probably his favorite) and recently added the Rainbow and Banana, to see how he likes those. Usually he likes toys that will roll *so he can give chase...All cat toys should be observed for signs of wear but I feel safer that this is nothing but quality heavy-duty fabric and catnip. And that's it.Well done, duckyworld, and I'm telling all my friends about this great line of toys!!!"
5,Cats love it.,"I have three cats. Because of it's popularity, I had to purchase at least three so my little darlings would not fight over this wonderful toy."
3,"Without the Thorns, the Rose Won't Be Sweet or Lovely.","Back in the Seventies, I liked the Lynn Anderson recording of the song, ""I Never Promised You A Rose Garden,"" and remember it playing on my car radio as I raced to a PTA meeting out of town and visualized how life could be better. I have never enjoyed country music as it is weepy (like Tammy Wynette) and sad. But life is just that way sometimes, in youth who take drugs and drink alcohol and later in life when the older person drinks in excess to dull his senses and his lifestyle.We must cope with the good and the bad. Rose Garden was inspiration as well as touching when Lynn Anderson sang it."
2,Hard to watch,"I know not everyone is a great public speaker, and the guy's credentials are amazing. Plus he knows his stuff and teaches some decent exercises. Hving said that, it's touch to watch and listen sometimes because every other word was Uh um, etc. It's like they did it all on one take, and it came off unprofessional. I really should have just listened to friends who advised me as a beginning bassist just to use free you tube videos. I see why now."
2,Not bad for the price but leaves you wanting,"For the price, this video gives you a brief overview of raw beginner level material. I can't get over how vague Tony is in his suggestions of technique. But by judging from his very inefficient left hand fingering (notice how far from the fingerboard his fingers are while fretting) I am surprised that he has been so successful. I enjoyed the humor but can't get past the many ""I've been playing for 30 years"" comments.Another bass video that gives you a trickle of the still-new electric bass guitar method from someone who is obviously self-taught (not always a bad thing)but has acquired poor left-hand hand habits. Since he's been playing for ""30 years"" he is obviously set in his ways."
3,For someone that doesn't have internet access....,"It's definitely what it stated, but it should have emphasized the word beginner. If you feel that you need something very very basic that will explains how to hold the bass, how to pluck a bass string and some descent bass excersises to do, and that you or the one you're sending it to lives out where they don't have the internet, then it does it's job well. If you have the internet, go to youtube and just look these up. Very very basic. If you've played guitar at all and are making a transition to bass, I wouldn't recommend."
2,So so,Definitely for the absolute beginner who has never seen a bass upclose. Very little learning material. Could do with more indepth explanation. Would not recommend this one.
2,Shipping,"The textbook it self was in good condition. The problem I had was the shipping. I order the book expecting it to be here within a week time, because it was only shipping from Aurora, IL; which is only a 30 to 45 minute drive from Chicago, IL. This book took the 14 days to reach me. Which cause me to be a week behind in my class. I choose this company because they were suppose to have had speed delivery. Was I fooled. If you decide to order from them, make sure you have more then 14 days before the 14 days it allows for shipping."
3,In the minority...,"Based on the other reviews, I know I'm in the minority, but when I finished this book I could only say, ""eh."" I never felt as if I knew and rooted for our heroine/protagonist and I never felt particularly interested in the setting and characters. It all seemed a bit cold and sterile. I will probably read another one by this author, though--I just picked up We'll Always Have Parrots at the Friends of the Library book shop."
2,Too many oddballs,"I didn't believe anything that happened in this book, not for a minute. I really like cozy mysteries and know they need to be taken with a grain of salt, but this was too much. Everything went the main character's way from start to finish. It felt incredibly contrived and it wasn't particularly funny. I don't care for ""hijinks,"" I guess. Was I supposed to accept that idiot ""Dad"" as a retired physician?The writing was presentable and I did laugh out loud once near the end, but overall the book was preposterous and not my style. I don't plan to read the earlier books."
2,Best Part,"The best part of this book was the last page, as I knew it was OVER.I have always liked this writer, and her books. We have a 'gaming magazine' here- nothing more- oh- not to forget a murderer who considers shooting over a dozen people near the end.It was wall to wall video games, a murder with a mouse cord, and karate moves, and a buzzard.There were no leaping loons, however-unless you consider the entire cast of this book.If I were a video person, perhaps I would have liked it better. I am happy to say it was a library book~ no money spent here."
3,Served its purpose,"I purchased this for Halloween for my son. It arrived 2 days before. I was originally upset because the order was not processed until 3 days after I placed the order. This lag time created the possibility that the product would arrive after Halloween.The extra money for the Deluxe costume gets you a plastic chest plate and an exhaust pipe that is a blaster. The blaster faired better than the chest plate. The fabric strips that hold the chest plate on the child are flimsy and held together by a small velcro circle.The costume made it through Halloween, and that's what mattered. We did not use the mask. Our son has the voice changing helmet. There were several admirers of the costume."
2,"looks alright, but doesn't hold up",This costume ripped and fell apart within a few minutes of my son putting it on....and no..my kid isn't a fattie.
3,Mask could use some work.,The mask sits to close on the face and the eyes are tiny. It was very painful. The rest of the costume was fine.
3,Halloween Costumer,It was what I expected. Not extremely cheap looking or made. Basically a decent value. Would purchase something similar again.
1,Optimal Prime Costume,Very cheap looking. Was not what I had expected. It was for a birthday party and the boys weren't very excited about it.
1,poor quality,My 4 year old loves this costume but the quality is terrible. It began falling apart on the first wear and now its in shreds.
2,caution,"I purchased this costume for my 4 and a half year-old son and he loved it the minute he saw it.HOWEVER, the minute he put on the mask he had a scratch under his eye and his chin from the CHEAPLY made mask.The edges are dangerously sharp, so please warn your child when they play with it.I had to take some clear tape and smooth out the eye holes and the chin and nose of the mask to make it less dangerous.The costume itself is super thin and it is already unraveling.I was hoping it would last until the 31st of October, but there is no way it will.It is poorly made and my son dresses up in it all the time.CAUTION:If you decide to purchase this costume for your child, examine the mask for sharp edges around the eye, nose, and mouth/chin opening.My son loves it. However, I would NEVER buy this again, nor would I recommend that anyone buys it. It is not worth the price."
1,INCOMPLETE ORDER,Received costume minus the mask and chest plate. the 4 year old I bought it for isn't very happy. I have not contacted Amazon or the seller to inquire - just found out last night that not everything was included with the order. It was a gift so when I received it I wrapped it - gave it to the boy yesterday. Not much fun to have tears go along with a gift.
3,OK,"This is a very cool looking costume. The canon arm is especially what I liked about it. However, it is very poorly made, the seams started to pull a part after it was worn only twice. Also, the velcro on the canon arm is very big and had to be additionally tailored to fit my child."
2,Don't buy cheap!!!!,"I thought this costume had a full arm gun and shielded chest piece!!! Nope there's cheap plastic that covers your arm and an even cheaper piece of plastic that wraps around your neck!!!! Don't buy.... Equivalent to the 10 dollar Kmart costume. Mine came with cheap mask ripped in half, we couldn't use this for halloween"
2,Not a winner,"Unless you are running your own business and have absolutely no PR experience, this book is not for you. I found it very basic and a bit outdated. No reference to online PR at all -- or even email releases! Save your money."
1,Not for beginners,"I did not find this book to be a good choice for the novice. I would recommend this to someone in the sales area of public relations but not the education area. Also, I think the checklists were quite long--too long for someone who is looking more for tips. Other books that exist that are more educational and beneficial to the novice."
3,A good Foreigner release but not great,"Let me say that I'm a big Lou Gramm fan and think his work with Foreigner is superb! The first release ""Foreigner"" is in my mind one of the best rock albums ever and a stunning debut. Lou is a main reason for such a fast start for the band.""Unusual Heat"" is a departure as Johnny Edwards took over from Lou. Johnny did a great job but by the time he hopped on board the Foreigner hit machine had slowed as well as the momentum. As a result, ""Unusual Heat"" appeared on the scene at a difficult time for the band.Yet, it must be said that Johnny Edwards did a fine job singing and that this is a solid release from Foreigner. Most likely it's for diehard fans since it's available only as an import but, on it's own, ""Unusual Heat"" is a credible rock effort."
3,Foreigner's New Lead Singer Gets the Job Done,"Foreigner's album ""Unusual Heat"" has the distinction of being the first Foreigner album not to feature Lou Gramm on vocals. Johnny Edwards (formerly of the Louisville, KY metal band Buster Brown) capably adds raw rock fervor to the Foreigner sound. Unfortunately, Mick Jones's songwriting isn't up to snuff on this album, as it seems that Mick was torn between writing power ballads and the rock anthems that made Foreigner famous. This is not one of Foreigner's best efforts, but I still enjoy the album on the whole."
2,A decent effort,"I'll keep it short... This album by Foreigner sounds more or less exactly like Bad Company's ""Holy water"". Best song is ""Low down and dirty"". It's decent polished rock of average standard from a time gone by. Maybe it's not Hair Metal but sure it's close to.It's not bad but it's not great."
4,Better than expected,"Perhaps the best thing about Foreigner to me is Lou Gramm's voice, which is the main reason I had low expectations for this album since someone else is on vocals. But I must admit it turned out to be pretty good. It doesn't sound like Foreigner, but it sounds like great rock music. The highlight of the album is ""Safe in my Heart"", which belongs on a compilation of Foreigner's best, even if Gramm isn't singing."
3,Unusual Heat,"1991's Unusual Heat is the black sheep of the Foreigner catalogue. Unusual Heat is the one and only album without lead vocalist Lou Gramm,who at the time was busy with his solo career. Johnny Edwards steps up to the mic,and does a pretty decent job.Some of the harder rocking eliments of the band are gone,but with Unusual Heat Foreigner came up with some pretty decent material.Only Heaven Knows,Lowdown adn Dirty,and Ready for the Rain are all highlights of Unusual Heat.The whole album is easy and enjoyable to listen to,just once the album stops playing the songs are gone from your memory.Good tunes just not much beneath the surface,but also not as bad as a lot of people say.Love Foreigner and think they should never even try to replace Lou Gramm,but with Unsual Heat Foreigner did a respectable job trying to move on."
1,one good song,"I really like Johnny Edwards vocals but sadly there is really only one good song on the CD -- ""Ready for the Rain."" My advice is buy that song as an MP3 and skip the CD."
4,A Good Reference Book,"Being new to the area, and wanting to get familiar with local plants, I found the information in this book to be very helpful. The month by month directions were helpful for plants I was unfamiliar with. My bigest critisim of it would be that there are no color pictures of the plants described so you have to have a hefty botanical book in order to see all of the plants mentioned. They should have a reference section such as that of Southern Living or Sunset which has small color pictures showing the desribed plants. That would make this book perfect."
4,Great Reminder,"This book contains excellent basic information about when to take care of the various plants in the yard. A great book for reminders about lawn care, when to prune what and other general tips for your Southern yard."
3,Not up to par,"Having read the Science Fiction volume of this series, I was pleased when this book was selected by my local book group and I approaching reading it with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, like everybody else in the book group, I was pretty disappointed. The stories in this collection are not satisfying as horror (e.g. they're not scary, creepy, don't cause feeling os paranoia), nor are many of them satisfying as gay stories (e.g. almost all the relationships in the book are negative and some stories barely have gay content at all). Many of the stories provoked what we in our book discussion called an ""eh?"" reaction -- too slow, lacking horror element, lacking element of a ""story"" with start, middle & end. There were a few stand-out stories (my favorites were ""Broken Canes,"" ""Memorabilia,"" and ""Blood Requium"") but the problem is that even the good stories failed as horror. I would say the collection is ""OK"" but if you don't read it, it's not a big miss."
4,Analysis of Freud's Book of Psychoanalysis,"Freud, surprisingly, does a fine job in explicating the basic ideas behind Psychoanalysis. Unlike other texts which can use pretty complicated and verbose language, Freud (and the editors) used clear and easy to read syntax. I recommend this book for any looking to get a basic understanding of Psychoanalysis or to further enhance an undergraduate or graduate class."
2,"Ok, but nothing dramatic.","Reading this book was more for fun than anything else. My girlfriend and I read it together and we found it interesting but certainly not erotic. Some of the erotic ideas are nothing more than common sense and I can think of hundreds of other ideas that are far more erotic. The astrology part of it is also questionable. Overall this book was ok to read, but we didn't feel it contained anything inspirational or mind busting."
2,Cosmo Readers -this book is for you!,Oh please Olivia your personal review must mean you are desperate! I did get your book free from a book club so I am glad didn't spend the money. If a person would like to laugh this book is for you. The recipes alone are worth a long one. I am sorry but this book is so shallow if you thought Goodman's Love Signs was hokey-this is the 90's version-don't insult our intelligence-Marabell Morgan of astrology!
4,Very Interesting,"I enjoyed this book... and so did my man. It is playfully written and very enjoyable. A good read, and worth the money!"
3,Ankle Weights,Wish the weights did not have solid core weights. Tend to hit my ankle in an uncomfortable position.
5,Product Delivers As Probmised,It is as described. Fast delivery. Easy to use and it comes with a pamphlet of possible usage to follow. Fine product quality and my wife says it looks good too!
2,Danskin adjustable ankle weights,"Do not buy these if you have relatively small ankles. I liked them at first, but very quickly they became stretched out, and they would frequently fall off as I was walking. Over about only 6 months of use (two or three times a week), the material was gradually stretched longer, and then the velcro does not secure compeletely. They have fallen off many times as I was walking in the gym and/or crossing the street in NYC, which was very inconvenient!"
1,Deserves -1 star,"This product is yet another example of terrible business ethics, wherein manufacturers sell their products using misleading descriptions (and then to be ""technically correct"" - they have some additional qualifiers written in smaller fonts).They mislead you to think that it will fit all ankles (and then write ""snug fit for most sizes"" in a smaller font). Why the hell can't they provide sizing with their product (like the wrist-bands that come for writs stability). Similarly, the 10lbs weight pairing is cleverly written to mislead the buyer into thinking that it is 2x10lbs.I can imagine this product being workable for some customers, who have a much wider ankle/wrist - so to be fair, the product itself is probably ok (not sure for the price though). But having said that I would never buy (or recommend anyone to buy) products of a company which cons people. Hence -ve stars from me."
1,"Nothing Like the Picture, Made in China","I purchased these weights to wear on my ankles during daily work and replace another brand that I have. I own a pair of Valeo ankle wieghts but hated them. They were huge and filled with sand pockets. Now I understand why they want sand in those things, its to be easy on the skin and tendons. But what happens is that the sand accumulates on the bottom of the sacks and you have a massive bulge that undoes the velcro.The Danskin Weights look nothing like the picture here on Amazon. In reality there are two small rods of metal one pound each and the three pound that are left are sand! Again with the sand.How hard can it be to make a non-sand one? It will reduce the size by more than two thirds. If they are worried about the comfort they can coat them with gel.I guess I expected too much from a Made in China product."
5,Best ankle weights i ever owned so far...,"I used to have ankle weights thats would scratch the hell out of my ankles, but these Danskin's feel nice and soft. I use them for Kick boxing training, not running. I weigh 157 and they dont strap onto my foot VERY tight like I would like, so i wear shoes and thats solved. Like i said, i use these for serious kicking action."
3,not good at a bare ancle,"you have to wear it on socks it rubs you leg ,the welcro rubs against your leg"
4,Too big for my ankles,I like these weights - I just wish they would adjust a little tighter. I'm going to have to add my own Velcro to them so they will stay tight.
1,Read the description first below in product details,"I ordered the product based on what I read at the top of the page. At first glance, I thought I would receive (2) five pound weights for each leg. That is not the case. Each weight is maximum of 2.5 pounds. So this is misleading if you don't scroll to the details. I was lucky to cancel the order."
4,"I like them, but don't walk in them",I have carpal tunnel and using any type of hand weight that I have to grip is painful. These weights are great for me since I can strap them to my lower arm/wrist for upper body workouts. I also like them for light leg exercises. But with the metal bars in them they are NOT good for walking.
2,On The Pow Wow Trail,"I was disappointed in several aspects of this documentary. First, very poor production values and technical quality. The recorded voices and the film are out of sync throughout. Pow Wow drumming and singing are used minimally during film of the dancers. More often there is a Robert Mirabal-ish New Age soundtrack. If you enjoy this type of music you may find it less a negative for the film than I did. If you're collecting a lot of Pow Wow films, you might want to add this one...but find it used or at a sale price. $16.00 is a high price for a 30-minute film of poor technical quality. If you are looking for an introduction to the Pow Wow Trail, or to Pow Wow music, I would not recommend this film for you. Overall this views much more like somebody's home movie than like a professionally-produced film, although it evidently was the latter."
5,Beautiful but not very jazzy,"silje is a norway jazz singer,but this ablum is not very jazzy and most songs are ballards. and her voice is not jazzy at all, not like Ella , Sarah or Billie or anyoneI think her voice is similiar like Cyndi Lauper which is very thin.Well and her voice is really special as Cyndi, --unforgettable~!!!I love this ablum very much, I like the ballards in this ablum,so peaceful and beautiful,(forgive me I am not english native speaker I can not find so many good word to decribe it)Listen to this pop ballards ablum makes me feel very good~A very Special singer.~"
1,What a Disappointment,"My 9 year old son was so excited by the commercial for this product. He met me at the door with his money to order it. When the order arrived he was jumping up and down. When we took it out of the package, I immediately noticed that the plastic seemed flimsy and the tubing was a little too firm to make it fit into the base correctly. After many tries, we finally got it all to snap into place. We followed the directions word for word, and it would not work. The pressure did not seem to build and water was leaking into the base. There was no way for us to fix it ourselves. Looking online I finally found a phone number for customer support. The manufacturer sighed, and said that when they had gotten one in, they had assembled it and been unable to get it to work properly either. They recommended that I return it for a refund as they had no replacements. My son was in tears."
1,Misleading,"This product is very misleading. The commercial is so misrepresentative of the product. Nothing about this product is fun. The directions are hard to interpret and the ""arm"" itself could not crush a cottonball. Poor packaging. I would not recommend this toy for anyone."
1,This toy is junk,"My son received this toy for his 5th birthday. It seemed like a neat idea for a toy, however, once out of the box it was clear that this toy was poorly designed, poorly constructed and nothing but a piece of junk. The components would not fit in the base correctly, there were multiple leaks and no part of the claw worked at all. What a disappointment. The only reason I gave this toy one star is because I couldn't give it zero."
4,The Singles are Killer!!!,These youngsters are AWESOME....They hit Europe in October then Japan in November....Looks like they're on their way UP!!!
5,The Singles Rock the HOUSE,"Better Than Before is a brilliant album constructed with flowing harmonies and beats that force you to tap your feet. The retro sound is balanced perfectly by a creative new blast of power pop. The guitar play is especially strong and lends greatly to the overall success of the songs through a passionate and pure ""let's rock"" attitude. Think Weezer meets the Beatles meets Steve Miller Band. All around great album. I definitely reccomend it to anyone who needs a breath of fresh air in a suffocating music industry gasping for the next coming of Britney Mathers."
3,RollingStone.com,"The Singles are no mere Detroit garage band, they're capable rock historians. Wearing 1960's pop/rock influences proudly on their sleeves, this Vincent Frederick-fronted combo nods to everyone from Buddy Holly (""See You Again"") to the Zombies (""Until You Came Along"") to the Who circa '65 (""I'm In Love With You""). These originals may not be that original, but skillfully constructed, Byrds-derived pop like ""Since You've Been Gone"" is impossible to resist. And ""It'll Never Be the Same Again"" pilfers the guitar hook from the Flamin' Groovies staple ""Shake Some Action"" with exemplary results. Still, the centerpiece of Better Than Before, produced by White Stripes vet Jim Diamond, is ""I'm Coming Home to You,"" a gorgeous lament that's also the least derivative tune here. The Singles aren't breaking any new ground, and at times the retro material gets a bit redundant, but rarely has a history lesson been this fun."
4,Merseybeat Meets Detroit,"If the Singles resembled a car they'd be today's Mini-Cooper: Legendary style and feel rebuilt with modern technology equals a whole lot of rockin' fun!This is a sweet combo of Mid 60's Merseybeat-inspired Power Pop songwriting with raw 3-part harmonies turbocharged with today's modern ""Garage Rock"" power ala the Strokes and Hives.Nothing new or innovative here, but The Singles display everything that made UK 63-66 Pop such a memorable time in Rock history - now Americanized and updated for today."
5,Mellow Magic,"Truly the Very Best. I must have been starving for great smooth jazz guitaur, and this CD is a feast for my ears."
4,Excellent,Anytime an album has the words the very best on it you have to take that with a grain of salt. Many of these best of albums are not that at all.But here is one that actually lives up to the words.He has on here put the finest selection of his best songs that anyone could ask for. This is one cd that does not grow tiring the more you listen to it. He has such an incredible sense of melody for these songs and that flow generates a vibe that makes this very enjoyable no matter what you may doing. Get this one first if you have never have been treated to the amazing guitar of this artist.
3,Needs more details,"I've got 95 Toyota Corolla. Well, you know, covering 93-02 model years in one book is not enough. 50% of the book is not for my model year, so it's quite confusing and useless."
3,Average,It would be more useful as a book if it had more pictures showing details.Covering 2 car brands for a 10 year period is one of the prominent drawbacks of this book. However it gives you enough information to get to know your car and its parts and do the periodic check-ups.Worth the money but not enough to be the only source for the home mechanic.
4,"Useful manual, seems accurate and adequately complete","I just purchased this manual for a 2001 Prizm that will be driven by my younger son. We have had to do a few repairs on the car to get it ready for driving and the manual has been very useful in helping with issues such as a driver's side door handle and sideview power mirror (reviewed elsewhere), hinge and latch lubrication, electrical issues as well as in researching and correcting some emissions system issues. The manual is pretty well written and has enough pictures to help do the tasks we have used it for so far. There are separate sections for older vs. newer Prizms in areas where differences exist and so far they have seemed accurate and approprate to what we are seeing on the 2001 model. I'm sure it comes nowhere close to the manufacturer's shop manuals in detail, but so far it has done the job. Recommended."
4,Nice complement to info on the web,"This is a great book to have by my side for various repairs on my 2000 Toyota Corolla. Its not perfect and not as detailed as I would like, but a must have if you do home repairs. I found some very needed information in the book that I couldn't find on the web - several good pictures helped as well."
3,Useful,"Was able to find all the information I needed to replace my window motor, but had to flip between several sections of the book to find all the info I needed."
5,Good,My dad bought this for my car and he said that it's great! He has no complaints and it is very informative! It got here very fast and was in great condition!
4,Just as advertised,"The manual was used when I purchased it, and it came thru as described. It is a decent manual for the casual backyard mechanic,and I know I will be able to use it to help decide if I want to tackle any of the maintenance my awesome '96 Corolla might need."
3,Repair manuals have changed - not always for the best,"You want to do it yourself? Ok. Look in a repair manual. However, Haynes manuals don't always put the information where you would think to look for it. Then, in places the manual suggests the repair work you want to do should be done by a professional. Still, most of the information is in the manual and the work can be accomplished. But, why in the heck should one have to hunt through the manual to find bolt torques specific to the job you are doing??? Anyway, Hanes manuals are better than others."
3,Lots of footage from the dash,There is a lot of footage here for the price. The soundtrack is not really my style but that is just preference. It lacks the interactive coaching that makers like Global Ride use. If you're looking for some good scenery while you strap on the headphones then this might be your ticket. All the filming is POV out the dash of a car which is not my favorite but it works.
3,Video quality is dissapointing,"The idea is great and the scenes are good but the quality of resolution is like an old VCR recording. I thought maybe it was because my TV is too large and wide screen, so I tried it on a small computer screen. It looked the same. The red/orange color of the rock was quite off. Again I tried color and saturation adjustments but couldn't get it to look right. I will still use it, but the color and low resolution is bothersome to me. If that is ok with you then you will probably like the product."
5,Beautiful Escape From The Boring Reality of The Exercise Bike,"I loved this video so much I ordered the South Carolina and Amish Country Videos, also gorgeous. The music is well matched and keeps you on pace. These videos successfully replicate riding a bike through beautiful countryside. Pair these with the GelTech Eleven81 seat pad, also sold by Amazon.com,and you'll be in heaven."
2,"somewhat boring, equally, somewhat interesting","Books set in considerable past eras are frustrating in that it must be written in a 21st century dialogue. Thus, information written about cannot be factual regardless of time-line accuracies. This is an educated writer, authoring a book better left unwritten or perhaps broken down into several editions. Physically weighty."
3,A major disappointment,"I looked forward to this book because I love the city of London and I enjoyed ""Sarum"" (didn't read Russka). But gor blimey, this book just plods along! The characters are tissue thin and if he didn't keep bringing up the webbed toes and big noses, etc., I couldn't have kept anyone straight"
4,A keeper!,"For those who do not like to read history, ""London"" provides a fascinating look at one of the world's foremost cities. Its chapters are almost like short stories in that they concentrate on a particular period in history yet one feels the need to follow the characters' ancestors through to the next era. I didn't expect to like it half as much as I did and recommend it to history and literary buffs alike"
1,I give up,"I read New York the Novel and enjoyed it, I read it in 9 days. The characters are just confusing. I am stuck home, have had the book for 3 weeks, am on page 360 and plan to return the book to the library tomorrow. I give up. The characters ruined this book, the building of London was interesting. I am going to try Sarum, because I did enjoy most of New York, the Novel."
2,Where are all the Women?,"London is the type of book that I generally love. However, I find many missing elements in the book, namely - women. Where the author is very meticulous with most details, he seems to skip important events where the central players are women. Henry II made an excellent marrige... never mentioned to whom! Only one of the most famous women who ever lived in England. This is aparant all over the novel and I was sorely disappointed."
2,Michener Redux,"This book can be easily classified for the reader; if you like James Michener's oeuvre this is for you. Historical fiction that makes up in detail what it lacks in heart, multiple families whose lives mysteriously repeat themselves(reincarnation?), and a heft to make you think it is more than a giant soap opera. However, Michener is not for me and this book left me cold. The history is pretty solid though, so at least it's well-researched."
2,"With more skilled writing, this would have been a great book","While the stories are interesting and the book seems to be well researched, it becomes boring soon. The writing style is rather bland if not wooden. With more skilled and creative writing, this would have been a great book."
2,History as a Soap Opera,"The book provides a broad history lesson about the city of London and is, from that perspective, quite interesting. I have spent a good deal of time in London and know the city quite well. Rutherford's pages are fact-packed and the more familiar you are with the streets and districts of which he speaks the more interesting the book will be. I was just back in London a few weeks ago and recalling those factoids gave me a different perspective on places I've know for many years. The problem with the book, however, is just that: it is a book of factoids. The vignettes are, to be kind, trite and contrived. The book is eposodic, by necessity I guess, but it is unengaging because of this. In my view, the reader not very familiar with London will find the book unfulfilling."
3,Enjoyable History Lessons; Skimpy stories,"I enjoy most historical novels, but I prefer them to be more focused: I've started many a Michner book, but finished very few.Rutherfurd's book somewhat frustrated me with the short stories that seemed like Reader's Digest versions of a longer novel; this the result of an ambitious premise, that he could capture 2,000 yrs of history in the linear tales of simple people. I think fewer and longer chapters would have worked better for me. Yet I enjoyed each chapter while I read it. My disappointment was in not being able to appreciate a deeper storyline.The background history that the author provides is fascinating, even for someone like me who has only been to London once."
2,"Rutherford's book is good, but just too long.","I have enjoyed parts of this book by Rutherford, as I enjoyed his earlier work Sarum. The only problem is that the book is way way too long. While being comprised of short stories makes it a little easier to read, it is also a problem. You find yourself wanting the stories that work to continue, and those that don't to end as soon as possible. I'm stuck about 3/4 of the way through the book, plodding along, just wanting to get it over with, but bullheaded enough not to quit the book."
4,Still a good read,"I read this book on the recommendation of a friend many years ago. Too long to remember the details so I am really enjoying it again. Enjoy the weaving of a family history into the establishment, growth and development of one of the world's great cities."
5,Staying Power,"I read this book shortly after it came out, and took time off from work to read it. I was fascinated by the scope of the timeline, the connection of the fictional characters, and above all, the glorious city of London as both the backdrop and the main character. The book had an impact on me, and I wish I could travel to England to actually see the sights that became very vivid to me through the book. When/if I ever get to England, I will definitely re-read London to get the flavor again."
5,Whew! I'm exhausted but very happy!,"When I finally finished this book after many early morning reading sessions (when I enjoy reading the most) I laid it down and stared off into space for quite some time, trying to stay on my ""high"" as long as possible. Rutherfurd transported me so thoroughly, not only to my native city but back in time. Through his amazing research, I was able to picture what my old stomping grounds of Clapham and Vauxhall (or Vaux's Hall) and Lavender Hill used to be like, say, 500 years ago. He taught me so much about my city, my language, and my roots. How many Brits. know that they have perhaps more French blood in their veins than Anglo-Saxon? Using names such as Barnikel the Dane, Penny the Huguenot, or Meredith, descended from the Welsh, I was able to keep the characters straight througout the novel. The Doggets and Duckets and Bulls were sometimes confusing but that did not spoil my enjoyment of each little story within a story. I thoroughly recommend this book!"
2,Better than melatonin,"What's the point. A dash of white hair, webbed fingers, ...? I kept waiting for a reason - never got it. Starts off interesting enough, lots of history. About half way through one begins to get impatient. With a hundred pages to go, one wonders if it will ever end. Nevertheless, it's a great way to put yourself to sleep at night. More effective than melatonin."
3,It's OK. but ...,"It is a pretty fair historical novel, but it just didn't measure up to some of Rutherfurd's previous work. To me, it was ""stretched out"" more than needed."
2,Who wrote this mess?,"Who wrote this mess?Certainly not the same Edward Rutherfurd that wrote ""Sarum.""I finished it just because I wanted to prove to myself that I could read this AND ""Underworld"" in a year, but I cannot and will not recommend it to anyone!BORING!"
2,I was dissapointed,I was so looking forward to Rutherford's next book. I had read Sarum and Ruska and was anxiously awaiting an engrossing new read. But I was dissapointed with London. It did not have the same grip to it that the earlier two did.
4,An Epic Journey Through the History of London England,"A wonderful story that spans the entire scope of the history of London from prehistoric through current times. If you have ever visited London or have the urge to travel there some day, this is a great introductory book that will set the stage for understanding the manifold complexities of this truely international city. Spun with a series of story teller's yarns, the intricate threads of many generations are woven together to produce a rich historical tapestry. Although a rather long narrative, the reader is constantly motivated by complex plots and quasi-fictional accounts of characters that add flesh and bone to what would otherwise be a dry textbook of facts. A delightful mixture of Jane Auel and James Mitchner styles, with a unique freshness that makes this book a great adventure in historical fiction! Highly recommended."
3,Not bad,"As an American with no education in British history, this was a good book to get the highlights. But this book was slow going at times and didn't always keep my attention. I got confused about who was who and had to refer to the genealogical chart in the front frequently."
4,Perfect Summer Reading!,"I found this book to be interesting while at the same time informative. This is perfect summer reading because it kept my attention for five weeks of traveling (yes, I was traveling in England and I did go to London) and will most likely keep your attention with it's intricate tale. Also, since it's a long book, it will give you something to read for the whole summer. However, I thought there were a few flaws within the story but, don't let that stop you from reading this book. Just find some time and be prepared to be engulfed in the history of London. PS. If you ever see a copy of London floating in the ocean, that's my copy which went overboard when I went boating. Thus, I'm here to buy a new copy of London."
5,Fascinating Read,"Usually when I read a book that is unusually long, no matter how highly rated, I wind up thinking it could easily be cut in half. Not so with ""London."" I was totally fascinated all the way through. It reads like a collection of short stories loosely tied together while presenting the economic, social and political history of London. If anything, the book is too short as more time could/should have been devoted to the present and recent past."
4,"A great book, despite the 1000+ pages","London is really a very interesting book, it gives you a great picture of London through the years. If you see this book in a bookstore you'll think:""Oh my God, what a bulk!"", but as soon as you start reading you'll find that you forget its size. The 1305 pages in the paperback are all filled with entertaining stories about life in London, and you'll read through them as easily as you'd read through the latest Crichton. Pity though that the author is very much interested in the Stuart-age, and it seems he thought when he reached the last hundred pages :""Oh, well, it's just the twentieth century, we all know that! I won't give it too much attention."" The Victorian era is also given too little attention. But despite these things, it is a wonderful picture of life in London through the ages. This book is one of the rare books where it is thrilling to read about a man who's almost bitten by a flea. It's a great read for everyone who loves England and its capital."
4,"Once upon a time, there was a tribe, town, city of London","The author does an admirable job explaining the intricacies of London history. However, each chapter could be expanded into a book in its own right and I found myself yearning for more information on the lives of the characters and less information on the economy and politics of London and surrounding areas."
5,An engrossing metamorphosis of London town,"Sweeping, saga-like, hard-to-put down. I had the pleasure of reading LONDON while traveling in England and Scotland. Being there while reading it made LONDON even more fascinating. LONDON, cleverly recanted in story form, is an absolute feast."
2,Wooden prose but easy-to-digest history,"This is a book I would recommend to someone taking their first trip to England, who was interested in a light historical overview. ""London"" provides manageable bites of the flow of history and does a nice job of presenting the history in a way likely to be remembered by the use of inter-generational stories. But the writing is wooden and the characters flat. I quit reading it when the historical period became more familiar. Edith Pargeter, for example, did this sort of thing much better"
2,Not as dry as most textbooks....not as fun as most novels,"I found the book to be very slow moving. It seems that Rutherfurd committed to historical accuracy at the expense of attention-keeping activity. While most chapters finished in an interesting fashion, it felt a labor to get there. I must admit that at times I found the book informative on various points of London's history, overall it is not an easy read."
4,A Treasure!,"Don't let the length of this book put you off, it is very well written and a pleasure to read. Starting with the conquest of Britain by Julius Caesar to the present (1997), this book will captivate you all along the way. My only complaint (small at that) is the fact that in the later years (1750 and beyond), the author doesn't spend as much time as in the earlier years and you don't get the same detail and feel as earlier in the book. It is hard at times to follow who's who, but the charts in the front of the book are great aides and despite the fact that chapters often jump hundreds of years, overall the book flows well. Well worth your time!"
1,Much too long and boring. Like a text book. Gave up,I could not continue with this book any longer than 200 pages. Did'nt care what happened to the people. Found that I was speed reading just to get through it. This book is not for me. Can't give it away.
1,Cant read it.,Unfortunately my wifi connection faded as I was downloading this book so although I have paid for it I cannot read it and therefore cannot report on it.
4,good read,"I picked this up at the library book sale in HardBack. It contains more politics than I personally enjoy, but does seem to be a historical summation of things that happened in/around London since the beginning of time. Quite interesting if you are interested in tidbits of ""current events"" over the centuries and a bit of human interest as well. :)"
1,Luckily the city is not as boring as the book!,"Over 800 pages....I've only been able to force myself to read the first 133. Yes, the history of England, and especially London, is fascinating. No, the fictional characters over the generations are not! The only common thread is the inheritance pattern of ancestors over the centuries, which is trite and meaningless description. The problem is that none of the characters or their historical situations are explored in any depth. I just couldn't bear to waste the summer plodding through another 700 pages of the grey-haired, webbed-fingers ancestors who lived in what is now London"
1,38 pages was my limit - BORING!!!,"The 800+ pages of this book did not deter me at all. I read Sarum and liked it. It was not perfect, but it was good enough for me to seek out this author again. London, however, was a different matter. I read - DRAGGED - myself through the first 38 pages and found the initial characters so completely boring that I could have cared less what became of them. My normal rule is 100+ before making a decision to close a book, and I think I've only ever closed 1 or 2. This one is now added to that short list. In fairness, it may get better - it may have turned out to be a thrilling, moving piece of literary work. Unfortunately, the beginning was SO bad that I don't even care if it gets better. I not only closed it - I donated it to the library. Maybe an nice insomniac will find it helpful."
1,Terrible,"Repeated beatings with a stick to the head are more fun than reading this novel. I had to read Rutherford's other novel, Sarum, for History class and experienced the same results. The scenes in London become dull and repetative after the first 300 pages or so(there are 1,100 all together)."
1,Only one question--could it BE any more boring?,"I evidently don't have the patience of the other readers who posted here. I have rarely read anything so dull, with characters so wooden and impossible to be interested in. Not since ""And Ladies of the Club"" have I encountered a novel so absolutely a waste of precious hours of my life that I can never get back. Needless to say, I can't finish it--could hardly even begin it. I'm giving up."
2,Not one of the better historical fictional works,"I slogged through ""London"" while recuperating from a serious illness and couldn't do much but stay in bed. I was interested in the historical links, but, oh, those characters were pretty flat. Not one provoked any feeling. Why do authors believe that longer is better? Take a lesson from Hemingway. Would not recommend it."
2,Not worth the time it takes to read it,"The opening chapters were fairly interesting, but by the time I was half-way through the book, I found that it was not holding my attention. Though the book seems exhaustive, in fact most of the subject matter (and the characters) are glossed over. I found the chapter about the Elizabethan theatre so annoying that I pretty much gave up on this one."
2,Alchemy in reverse: gold into lead,"Being an Anglophile of long standing, I particularly enjoyed the author's previous work, ""Sarum"". Furthermore, I regard London as my most favorite place on this planet. Therefore, I was deeply disappointed in ""London"", and overlong telling of the city's history through the eyes of a multitude of mundane characters on fictional family trees growing through the centuries from pre-Roman Britain to the present. This was alchemy in reverse: London's golden history transformed to leaden boredom. There were too many characters about whom the reader could say, ""Who cares?"" I certainly didn't."
3,Enjoyable Piece of Popular Fiction,"London is my favorite city, and I'm partial to anything even remotely connected with it. And I love history. Therefore, I did enjoy this book. ""Enjoyed""--not ""moved by"" or ""enlightened by.""It really is just a much more polished and erudite ""beach read""--not a major novel by any means.But a very enjoyable one, a good chance to while away a few weeks of spare time without having to think too much. A hamburger, not a steak--but a good hamburger."
5,Family traits observed down the ages,"""London: The Novel"" is unique and very special. It is a long and enjoyable book that, like all the best books, allows you to immerse yourself in and toenter another world. Actually, many worlds, each chapter being effectively a stand-alone short story in its own right.Personally I usually have a problem with short stories because I don't like discovering that they are about to end, when I have just become familiar with the setting and all of the characters.However, in this case, although the stories end chapter by chapter, there is continuity in terms of family lines. Which makes it rather wonderful - because you can see how a family trait manifests itself in the different ages. For example, is the ruthlessness necessary for survival in medieval England a help or a hindrance in later, more genteel times? This book deserves to occupy a little nook somewhere in your bookshelf!"
3,wordy,The intrigue and corruption of politics dates back to the ice man age as reflected in this novel.It is however too verbose and detailed for my taste.I would have enjoyed this novel more if it had centered more on the characters then on the historical and descriptive passages.I found I was struggling to try to finish it rather than anxious to.
5,London,"I love this author. Just like New York, this novel tells the history of a city through fictional families.It is made more enjoyable with kindle as I can take a detour to Wikipedia or the dictionary to fully understand the facts.This book takes you away to another place just as a good book should."
4,From an Anglophile,"Had already read ""Sarum"" which kept me enthralled thru all of its 800+ pages. This one is very much like it, a fascinating view of the 'growing pains' that resulted in the London of today. I read ""London"" less as a novel than as a history book that gives the human detail often missing from the usual histories."
3,"Not what I expected, sort of ""Historical Fiction Lite"".","I purchased this book to read during my first trip to London. While the novel was obviously well researched I just didn't care for the style in which it was written. Too many gaps and ludicrous interactions between the relative nobodies of the novel and famous people. However, I did finish it quite quickly and enjoyed the history lesson."
3,Now I finally understand...,"As a student who's lived in the United Kingdom, I've taken loads of history courses on Britain without understanding one iota of it. Thanks to Rutherford, I finally do. Rutherford takes the great events of English history, focuses them in London (one could say the two are inseparable) and forges a cast of engaging characters the readers learn to care about. Loved the progression from ancient to modern times - well done indeed! As a student of history, I've always thought that history comes alive when we understand the daily lives and culture of various periods we study. I haven't read a more compelling novel rich in history since Ken Follett's ""Pillars of the Earth."" I highly recommend it to anybody who's interested in England or interesting in traveling there."
5,An Amazing accoplishment!,A wonderful presentation of London's history through the lives of complex and intriguing characters. Through the ages the story of London grows with the exitement and interest of the reader. A beautiful book.
3,Poor man's Michener,"This book was well researched and the characters were interesting for about the first 500 pages . . . after a while the next generation of Duckets, Doggets, Silversleeves and Merediths just got less and less interesting. I was surprised that half way through the book we were still in the medeval times. It seemed like there was a rush at the end to catch up to the present. Entertaining undertext and characters but highly predictable and all the surprises telegraphed way in advance."
2,It is better than melatonin!,"Although I appreciated all the history, the author's presentation was really dry. Overall the story had possiblities, but Rutherford is no James Michener. Rutherford does get an A for research though."
2,"London; A great idea, a poor presentation","Rutherfurd's attempt to chronicle the history of London over two millenia has fallen short of greatness. Through the ins and outs of his use of family lineage and sometimes playful stories, Rutherfurd's inability to construct a flowing prose which is continually(or at least a majority) captivating is his downfall. I found each chapter to begin with a ""kick"" then monotonously try to relate each family within a coherent story only to wrap up each chapter with haste. Rutherfurd includes a lot ""Jeopardy-esque"" trivia pertaining to each period but these interesting anecdotes cannot save the boredom which is the bulk of the book."
4,Historical fiction,"Purchased the paperback book for my wife. She loved it. After reading it, she gave it to our Marine grand-son to read. I re-ordered the larger hardback to keep as the smaller paperback was harder to read the small print. She is currently reading the ""New York"" novel by him."
5,"Buy it, it is great read and a great price too.","Like the author's other books, this is a journey through time in a particular location -- in this case, London. I have always thought London to be a depressing and unlovely place but this book gave me a much greater appreciation of the place, even a fondness and an urge to re-visit it(which I have resisted!). The book is easy to read, being made up of distinct stories involving distinct families and characters. It is hard to put down once you get into it. I loved it."
2,EASY TO UNDERSTAND INFORMAL HISTORY - LOUSY STORY LINES.,"After having made several trips to London, and always at a loss concerning the time-line of the history of the city, I really enjoyed the informal history lesson.....but the story line and characters were a bit boring and sophomoric. At times, I wondered if parts of the book were really fiction or actual history. Too bad some more definite differentiation could not have been made between the two. I was specifically interested in knowing the dates that different neighborhoods were established, and when landmark buildings etc were built. I still don't know if the dates given were fact or fiction."
4,Rutherford does a good job,Rutherford's historical fiction of London is well done and easy to read. Hard to put down and you are learning as you read. The flow is excellent and I would heartily recommend this book.
2,Superficial piffle,"I wonder if people rate this book so well because it is so big and they suspect that ""big"" and the effort required to create it means ""good"". Two stars then, for effort. London fails to provide any intrigue and thus, any interest. London has been likened to a collectioni of smaller novels, taken apart like this, these sub-novels are lightweight and fail to answer the Hows, Whos and Whys of the story. Sadly, there is no synergy. I agree with former reviewers observing that women are overlooked but then so are many males. It is a pity that Mitchener has died!"
2,Zzzzzzzzzz...,"This book was BORING. While Rutherfurd tried to link the different eras by using the histories of several families, the novel still lacked continuity. A very disappointing effort."
5,BRILLIANT,"It is almost like many mini stories, each with there own suspense and tiny cliffhangers. The story flows and moves and you are there in London with the characters. The story weaves through fictional characters around real events and people. With every chapter you are filled with a better understanding of life in London, and who we are. Excellent read!! I recommend The Other Boleyn Girl as a follow up read."
3,Enjoyable!,"This book was everything I expected: glimpses into different epochs; interesting scraps of information; a plot spanning millenia. What kept this book from being a GREAT read was that there was no unexpected thrill, no frisson. Too bad, because the reader invests plenty of time in the book. However, it's great to read before your next trip to London. Just bear in mind that the names aren't all THAT important and keep on reading. Also, a word to the publisher -- make it easier to find the geneaological chart -- print it on the inside paper cover of the book. I was always flipping through the maps to look up out who begat whom."
3,You quickly forget who to care about.,"This set of stories provides numerous ""Oh, I didn't know that"" epiphanettes on name origins and practices but the delivery mechanisms are far from subtle. What is the origin of the multi-tiered wedding cake? It will take a duel, a death, a betrayal, an unpaid baker, and much more before you find out. This is a very long shaggy dog story with London factoids hung on a branch bare fir. A good book for Trivial Pursuit fans as it provides a mildly interesting framework for the steady drip drip of infobits.A great one for ""lights out"" readers. Numerous places to start and stop and a book mark is hardly necessary as the characters will reappear again and again - or so it seems.A book to borrow! I liked it."
4,Want to recapture that exciting feeling of your first time..,"...in London? Even if you are just planning your first journey to London, this book will bring home the magnitude of history which is buried under the cobbles.A must read for students travelling abroad - a good carry-on/time waster on the Eurorail - very hard to put down.I highly recommend this book to lovers of historical-fiction and travel."
3,"The history is great, but the players are mere shadows","This is a frustrating time travel. Early in the novel interest is high, detail is good and one is compelled to keep going with the read. Then, it becomes a labour and you realize there are many hundreds of pages to go and the author skips superficially over the characters. You want to know more about them but ..you don't get that pleasure. It's time travel and you don't get to stop at any port long enough to say you've been there. Ah...but what about that buried gold? Yes, he doesn't forget, thank goodness. It's a loose end that he thankfully brings closure to. For history fans, its a good summary, but don't pretend to be knowledgeable at your next party on the subject of London unless you find other supplements. And, where are the Beatles, did any of them have webbed fingers? Just Kidding!!"
5,London's story through the eyes of the great and the small,"As a frequent traveller to London, I picked up Rutherford's work in hopes of understanding the city a bit. I was pleasantly surprised that it was not just the story of a city as seen through the eyes of the upper class (as a lot of history is). But rather I was given a feel for different facets of the city as seen through the eyes of members of all social classes. Some of the characters were thin on depth, but this is to be expected when covering 2000 years of history. I ended up with a feel for the flow of time through this marvelous city that has shaped it into what it is today. And there is enough detail that I am left with the feeling that I was there when it all happened. Not quite as good as Sarum, but still first rate."
5,History in a nutshell,"I loved ""Sarum"", and was interested to see how Mr. Rutherford would tackle ""London"". He is very accurate but also adds his own interpretation of history and historical figures! Interesting to learn how many English words used today have come about - words we use today without thinking twice about them. Definitely a book for history buffs!"
3,"Attica, MI","The facts are informational historically, and interesting,but the authors style was abit too laborius in telling the story for my taste.I would still like to read his book on New York however for the historical info."
5,Breakaway - KK & Rita review,Another one of KK's albums my sister and I purchased when it was originally released. Enjoy Kris & Rita together. Love 'Dakota (the dancing bear). The cassette wore out over the years so had to replace it with the CD.
1,never got it,"The only Things I Got Was Silver Tongued Devil & I""And Live From Martha's Vineyard- The Classic ConcertWhat Happened To My Other Two Items??"
4,Nice book,I really like this book...it has almost everything I was looking for in a school memories book. The only major thing that I wish it had was the plastic sleeves to include anything loose....you have to provide those yourself.
2,Too complicated for a busy mom,"This is not the school years scrapbook for you if you just want something basic to keep track of each year for your child! It is VERY detailed with questions to answer about every part of your child's school day and after-school activities. Also, I did not like that report cards, awards, etc. are in different sections. You do not see an entire school year all together!"
5,fights!!!,I just got this dvd last night and popped it in. I really liked it. Unlike fighting mad this video doesn't have music playing over the fights. You can hear every blow being struck. The quality of most of the video is quite good. A definite must for your collection.
3,Latex Bathing Cap,I purchased this for wearing at the Y during swim exercise class. This is a light exercise class so there is no underwater or lap swim. I have long hair and it is difficult to stretch this and pull over the hair. It works best when I have stretched the cap over a bowl prior to use. It keeps my hair dry if I have properly fitted cap on but it seems to stay tighter towards the forehead and as a result gives a slight headache during usage. I continue to look for the perfect cap.
5,Just A Moment,"Although the other tunes on this cd are fine, the one that messes with my head is Coltrane's 'Moment's Notice'. I thought it was interesting when I first heard it on 'Blue Trane' but Stern has something special to say about this song. I believe he plays fast enough. Almost faster than my ears can keep up with."
3,reliable camp,"The film is really better than three stars but not quite four. This is everything one would expect from a quality Santo film; bad acting, dancing routines, goofy supernatural plot twists. The film, which is black and white, lacks the garish splendor of Treasure of Dracula or Contra Momia but succeeds in story pacing.Satisfying for fans of the genre."
4,SpongeBobs Back!,This game is fun but it doesnt use the touch screen very much. I love it. You get to venture all over Bikini Bottom finding things for people in order to get information or something useful. It is more of a adventure game then a fighting game. You don't really have to fight alot. This is a really fun game and I would definitly get it for your Nintendo Ds.
1,DS Spongbob: Yellow Avenger,"I have been very disappointed with this product. I bought it for my 8 year old daughter, thinking that she would love it. However, it has been far less than we anticipated. The directions are not thorough, and thus far we have not found any way to get sound, voices for the characters, etc. Overall, it has been a great waste of money. We expected much more for the price."
2,Waldo does not shrink well,"The idea of the enclosed mini magnifier was good but to no avail. The images were too small and the ink was not clear. I bought it for a child, but when I could not see Waldo clearly, I knew that it would be impossible for a child. If you want to find Waldo buy the larger edition."
1,Caution if buying for small children,This book is pocket size. Way to small to entertain very young people. I would have never bought it if I had realized how small it was as the pictures are way to small. Children loose interest to fast as all of the characters are just to small.
3,Waldo's trip across western civilization,"Length:: 0:51 MinsThis book contains twelve two-page pictorials.>>>Check with vender if book is the Large or Mini version before ordering.<<<ISBN: of book in video comes up with this listing when entered into search bar.1) Waldo sets out from his home. Difficulty 3/102) On to the beach. Difficulty 5/103) Waldo hits the slopes. 5/104) Waldo takes a dip in the river. Difficulty 3/105) Time to board the train. Difficulty 5/106) Don't miss the plane. Difficulty 4/107) Lets play a game. Difficulty 3/108) Lets make history. Difficulty 4/109) Smell that ocean breeze. Difficulty 2/1010) The zoo is for animals. Difficulty 1/1011) Need a new outfit? Difficulty 3/1012) Wanna go for a ride? Difficulty 3/10One of the easiest Waldo's ever. A lot of open spaces and Waldo doesn't hide like in other books he's just out in the open standing in the same pose throughout the book. Good artwork and settings, just not very tough."
3,"""Mini"" Edition",I did not realize this book was only about 3 x 5 inches. It's my fault because I did not notice that this was the mini edition. It does come with a cool magnify glass.
5,grandkids loved it!,"I bought Where's Waldo to share with my 5 year old grandson but his 2 1/2 year old brother also loved it. It was a great shared activity for the three of us and they repeatedly asked me to ""read"" Waldo to them! Very imaginative!"
2,meh,not much to say. i found all the waldos easily. i think it only took me about five minutes to go through the whole book. i gave it away as a gift.
3,Still a good workout,"Three might be a little low, but I can't quite give it four stars. I like the workouts, a TON of moves that really hit all the major muscle groups. I really feel a burn by the time I hit Round 3.I was just hoping for something that was more MMA instruction. I'm a huge UFC fan and was looking for more along those lines, like detail on how to be a cage fighter, work with punching bags.Again, can't complain about the workouts, they're good, no frills kind of exercises and I could see how doing them regularly would make a difference.Just picked up BJ Penn's book Martial Arts The Book of Knowledge. It gives you tons of play by play moves. Guess that what more what I was expecting. If you want serious martial arts instruction, I'd go with the Penn book. If you want a strong workout, you'd be good with this DVD."
5,Good workout,"Easy to follow, requires no additional equipment, but having a set of weights helps. Definitely gets the heart rate up."
1,Skip this one!,"I was very excited to try this video when I ordered it and was so disappointed when I tried it. I typically do P90X, the Biggest Loser, and Jillian Michaels workout dvds to give you a frame of reference. I have really enjoyed all of those programs and highly recommend them. This dvd, however, wasn't much of a workout at all and it was terribly boring. The warm-up and cool down are literally the instructor, Nick Stone, marching in place for 2 full minutes and that's it. The pace is very slow and Nick is very low energy. It sounds like he is reading his ""motivation prompts"" off of a cue card.I typically do not write reviews because I usually agree with the overall user ratings, but I felt the reviews on this one were off. I wonder if the reviewers know the instructor? There are so many great workout dvds out there (especially for less than $20), but this is not one of them."
2,Fails too often,"I have had four of these switches fail in eight years. Power to our space is protected well (we are tech people). No other systems have failed in those eight years anywhere in the building. ""Repair"" is $500 plus the cost and headache of returning the item to a Canadian company -- customs concerns, issues, and costs. Works great until it stops working all together."
1,talkswitch,"bought this system and spent two days on phone waiting for support when i couldnt get it to work, they didnt help and so far its been another two days trying to return it! Stay away from this company!"
2,To greasy,"I had color treated hair that is basically normal, so I thought well maybe it(shampoo & conditioner) would improve my hair in some way. So I tried it and oh my I looked like a grease pit. My hair was flat and lifeless. I wash my hair every other day and that second day was even worse. I looked liked I had not washed my hair in days! I couldn't even style it as usual cause it was so flat and greasy. The next time I even used the conditioner just on the ends and still just as bad. This must be for severly dry hair that needs moisture. It definately didn't work for me!"
5,Amazing results,"To be honest, I am not a big philosophy fan. I have never cared for any of their perfumes, their skin care line is seriously overated and their body washes are high priced. But, I have thick, chemically treated hair and finding a good shampoo and conditioner are tough. They either produce a buildup or don't moisturize. It was a surprising discovery to find that this shampoo and conditioner do a great job. I got the duo as a Christmas gift and I love how they make my hair feel. Clean, soft and not weighed down. Absolutely worth a try."
5,Fantastic!,"This shampoo is wonderful. I used it with the shear splendor conditioning mask and my hair has never been softer or more manageable. The smell is great, clean but sweet. I recommend this for anyone who wants healthier hair."
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT - GREAT FOR GIFT GIVING,My wife and I received a set of Shear Splendor Shampoo and Conditioner for Christmas and we both liked it very much. It is hard to explain what it smells like but it is similar to lemon custard. It leaves your hair silky soft and manageable. I have dry scalp problems and many shampoos tend to aggravate the problem but not this shampoo. I highly recommend this product.
5,kenyon line,"I found my gr gr grandfather line ,the book was in good shape when was shipeasy to find what your lookin for,great book."
2,Sins of the Flesh,"I had to stop reading it,because it just is too long. It didn't hold my interest. I woul not recommend it."
4,Not what I expected,Well this is written well but not the Fern Michael s I am use to reading at all.So different & not at all like her. (My opinion any way)
5,Sins of the Flesh,"I loved this story. I was fortunate in reading ""Sins of Ommission"" before getting ""Sins of the Flesh"". It was a great story and I couldn't put it down. I love everythig Fern Michaels writes. If she ever adds on to the story I would like to be notified so I could order it."
5,SINS OF THE FLESH,"I AM READING IT NOW AND IT IS WONDERFUL BOOK A CONTINUING STORY THAT WAS IN FIRST BOOK OF THIS SERIES. VERY ENTERTAINING AND INTERESTING , HARD TO PUT DOWN.FERN MICHAELS CONTINUES TO TURN OUT TERRIFIC BOOKS. A FRIEND GAVE ME THE FIRST BOOK AND I WAS GLAD TO BE ABLE TO FIND SECOND BOOK AT AMAZON. I HAVE FOUND I AM ABLE TO FIND BOOKS I'M MISSING FROM SERIES HERE. I'M THRILLED WITH THAT."
5,SLEPT ON,"THIS WAS ANOTHER OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS.ANYTIME I HAD TO MAKE A DRIVE OF 1HOUR OR LONGER,THAT CASSETTE WAS MY COMPANION.THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE MOST SLEPT ON ALBUMS OF ALL TIMES.THIS ALBUM HAD EXCELLENT PRODUCTION AND LARRY MARCUS WAS DEFINATELY ON TOP OF HIS GAME.MY KINDA GIRL WAS VERY MUCH A PARTY JAM,BUT THE STRENGTH OF THIS ALBUM WAS THE BALLADS.GO AHEAD AND CRY WAS NICE,BUT THE HEARTFELT I MISS YOU SO MUCH AND THIS LOVE WERE ABSOLUTELY THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS ALBUM.I AM HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS CD AFTER MY CASSETTE CAME UP MISSING.IT'S A SHAME THAT GOOD MUSIC LIKE THIS WENT ALL FOR NOT."
3,Alright,"The cd was awesome, however the package material was substandard,The cd case was broken upon arrival which left the cd scratched. I wasnot and am not happy."
4,Clinique Smoky Brown Eyebrow Pencil,"Cost is way too high, but something I use all the time and don't want to change. Superior product and like it. Shopped around to find it but discontinued so had to buy on line. Back on the market now."
4,"Rich color, natural look","I like this eyeliner & surprised there aren't more reviews out there for it. It delivered an easy, smooth precise line that didn't budge & although the color is Brown/Black, it was rich and dark so closer to black than brown. I'm trying to rich over to more natural products but if that were not the case, I'd definitely buy this again! It didn't budge & was easy to remove as well."
5,"George Jones....."".Hits I missed and one I didn't.""",Until this album I believe I had literally every song George had recorded.These are all songs new from George except his great hit HSLHT. He does anexcellent job on all. To be in his 79th year he is fantastic.He has been my favorite for almost 50 years and still is. He's the greatest.Ron
5,The one he didn't miss...,"I am no music expert by any means, but, in my humble opinion, the hit George Jones didn't miss, ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" is well worth the price of this cd if that is the only reason you buy it. I loved the song originally, but this version (an older voice that's a bit halting to be sure) touched my heart like never before. Thank you George, again."
3,ehh,"Mostly bad transfers here, although I must admit I enjoyed 36 Shaolin Beads immensely for some weird reason. The subs run off the edges etc so if you want quality you dont want this.If you can get it for $8 - $10 go for it.. otherwise I would pass, unless money's not really an issue."
5,"Best ""new artist"" breakthrough of 1998?","I think he'd get my vote, even though he's not new to his understandably loyal and enthusiastic local fans. I heard this CD at a Tower listening station, and of course the first track grabbed my attention right off the bat, but I was skeptical that he could keep it up for the whole disc. But he does, and the CD is a stand-out for its consistently great songs, as well as amazing variety. Hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't fine something to like here... I like all of it!"
4,A Shame,"It is a shame David Garza does not have more recognition. He certainly deserves it. I saw Discoball World on TV and was hooked on the song. I took a chance in buying this C.D. and it payed off. Garza's songs are easy to listen to; they drift like a cool breeze through the ears. In a world where corporate pop acts dominate the radio, we could sure use somone like Garza to be played as well. He gives some much-needed respectability back to popular music."
3,Its a great start!,"The cd is a little slow, but it is worthwhile. Kinder and Discoball world are worth a listen by themselves... Garza is talented vocally, but the music is lacking a bit... The major problem is the slow music!!! (With the exception of Kinder, Discoball world, and another song whose name I forgot.) Otherwise its a great CD... So buy it!!!"
4,Sweet As It Comes,"There is no loss of face in fossicking in Pop's rag and bone shop when you can produce a minor classic like Gaza's, 'This Euphoria'. His voice is somewhat dry, but utterly apt for the lightness of his material; tear-jerkers, and, yes, euphoria. Sure, it's teen fodder, but it owns a real heart, and dare I say it in such context, sincerity. Without the irony of Godley & Cream, or say, the sensuousness of McCartney, Garza still manages to scale the foothills of those big talents with worthy intent and graceful effect."
4,Pretty good pop music,"If you are into this sort of thing, you will like it. If you don't like this sort of thing, you won't enjoy it."
5,Better than His Work With the Who!!,"This is Roger's finest album, a showcase for the melding of Who vocals and LA Hair-Band rock stylings. Whoever thought this up is a genius!! Imagine Appetite for Destruction, but with Roger's vocals. Pure gold."
3,Nearly four stars,"I hated this album after first listening to it. It sat on my shelf literally for years, unplayed. I mocked it. Then for some reason I played it again and guess what? It's good. It would be four stars, but I still expect so much from Roger that he is still rated on a higher level.Rocks in the Head isn't like his very enjoyable first solo album, but thankfully it isn't like his Brian Adams fixation albums either. It is a good gender crossing AOR album that just needs a listener with an open mind. Recently, Roger Daltrey had made that tough, but this album does deliver, both in craft and with quality songs."
4,Who Needs the Who!!,"""Mirror Mirror"" is a classic. An extremely romantic song. One of the most romantic song ever in fact. Just like ""Something"". ""Mirror Mirror"", ""Can't Call It Love"", ""Love Is"", and ""Perfect World"" can all be Who songs. ""Days of Light', ""Time's Changed"", and ""Before My Time Is Up"", can also be Who songs. Why ""Who's Gonna Walk On Water"" was released as a single is besides me. Roger shows that it doesn't matter who wrote it, it's who sings it. He's never sounded better. A must for Who fans."
5,This is a great band,I saw these guys when then opend for SoCo and the Juliana Theory in Salt Lake City. I immediatly fell in love with their unique style of play. this cd is good from the start to the end...easily. The Red West had a great future ahead of them. BUY THIS CD!
5,Reminds me why I love music,"Red West is an exceedingly talented band. I had the pleasure of listening to Jayson sing and play his guitar several times on a camping trip before he was in this band, and he amazed me then, but seeing this band live absolutely blew me away. Listening to the Red West makes you revel in the sheer beauty of music. I sincerely hope they become HUGELY successful."
4,high speed,the red west is some good stuff. i saw them open for silverchair in nyc back in my. well worth the 10 bucks.
1,unsatisfied,Shipping was fast but the covers did not fit the seats the headrest did not fit either they were too small
3,A REHASH of SANTO vs.THE VAMPIRE WOMEN,"This is a pretty good entry into the Mexiluchahero film genre.It's biggest flaw is that it's more or less a carbon copy of Santo(Samson)vs.The Vampire Women.Just substitute witches for vampires.It even features Lorena Velazquez(who played the vampire queen in the first film)as the leader of the witches coven.El Santo uses his grappling skills to protect the heroine from a centuries old curse.The film also has a great scene where el Santo(the Saint)resists the"" temptations of the the flesh"" when one of the witches tries to seduce him.A major plus for this film is that it has English sub titles."
3,Nostalgic fun,"I always had a soft spot for the sad Beatle, and bought his vinyl albums when they came out back in the 1970's. The first few were fun, but right around this album - Rotogravure - they started to lack a little of the soul that the early ones had, which made up for Ringo's limited singing ability. Arif Mardin produced this one and is not as good as ""Ringo"" or ""Goodnight Vienna', which were both produced by Richard Perry. I enjoyed hearing the songs on Rotogravure, which I had not heard for 20 years. Which says something. And I may not reach for this album again anytime soon. But it was fun from a nostalgia point of view. If you are looking for a good album to hear for the first time, I would have to say you should look elsewhere."
3,Come On - Its the Beatles on one record,This record is worth a listen if for no other reason that it is the last time all 4 Beatles appear on a single CD (other than the Anthologies...).Give it a listen. A Dose of RnR is HOT!
1,Skip this one,"Another Ringo superstar effort, but, this album is very bland. It would get two stars if it didn't include the worst song John Lennon ever wrote, ""Cookin' (in the Kitchen of Love"")."
2,Pure what?,"The only thing on this album that is ""Pure Gold"" is the song ""Pure Gold."" The rest of the album is flat and dry like Ringo's voice! Stick to Ringo's Greatest Hits CD for the best songs of his career."
1,crud,"The fact that all 4 members of the most famous pop band ever are in some way connected with this album only makes it worse - ""Ringo's Rotogravure"" is crud of the first ordure. There is simply no excuse for non-songs such as ""Cookin'"" and ""This Be Called A Song""; they're just unlistenable trash, obviously recorded in an alcoholic haze. Contributors should stop apologising for Ringo's appalling musical taste and performance, and the album should be deleted asap."
2,Pretty Dry,"Myron Arms' ""Riddle of the Ice"" includes a collection of the most current theories used to try to explain the creation, movement, and distribution of ice in the Arctic, and not much else. For those looking for an adventure story, look elsewhere. If you're interested in the personal lives of the crew and the skipper, what you'll find is Arms' reflections on his own caustic nature and a few references to his encounters with shipmate ""Blue,"" which convieniently lend Arms an avenue, as most of the rest of his accounts of contact with the shipmates do,to show the reader how, while he's gruff and abrasive, his propensity for always being right usually is justified in the end. As for the science behind ""Riddle of the Ice,"" Arms left it up to the real scientists, providing the reader with a decent book report at best."
3,Mine's still going,"Mine's still going after 2 years. Received this as a gag gift at the office Christmas party. It shows the time, temperature, calendar, and has an alarm and countdown timer. Not sure I would pay full price for it.The biggest downside to this product (besides price) is that it absolutely chews through batteries. I must change the batteries in it a few times a year, whereas other similar clocks I have get changed about once every 2-3 years. Also would like the option to select the color independent from the display mode. Also wouldn't mind better quality construction. It feels substantial when you first pick it up, but open the battery compartment and it's very cheap (thin) plastic."
1,don't buy it,My daughters rec'd these for Christmas and they broke within 4 months. Brookstone won't stand behind them without a receipt even though everyone I speak to who had one says it broke. Its ridiculous that they keep selling it when they fail so soon after the purchase.
2,Battery guzzler,"The design is cool and all, but the battery consumption is absolutely ridiculous. It uses *three* batteries, which last about a month. My older Timex alarm clock uses one battery, which lasts at least a year. I wouldn't consider using this clock ethical unless I used it with rechargeable batteries. For now, I'm back to my old clock."
3,it's ok,"The clock works fine, and I enjoy the temperature function. However it sometimes beeps when changing to other functions, i.e. timer or date, when it is not touched. The constant random beeping does get a little annoying."
5,LEGIT-O-POTAMUS!,THIS CLOCK IS SO AWSUM I WANT LEIK 5 OF EM! LEIK ALL U G0TTA DO IS GET CLOSE TO IT AND IT STARTS TO KNOW UR THERE. ITS KINDA SCAREY THOUGH BECAUSE IT MAKES U THINK THA GoVeRnMeNt MITE Be TrYiNg To WaTcH yOu AnD aLl ThE tHiNgS yOu ArE dOiNg InClUdInG uR aMaZoN PURCHASES!! OMG BY FIVE OF THEM RITE NOW GUYZ IM SERIOUS!!!
4,Passage to Zarahemla,The DVD arrived only after 2 weeks here in Australia and it worked just fine.The children really enjoyed it as it was packed with action and good humour.The story line was good and it had a few twists to make it interesting.Altogether a great DVD that children would enjoy.
1,don't buy it,"the acting was second rate, plot was even shallower the only reference to zarahemla was a time traveler, saying Zarahemla is over that hill. It involved some modern juveniles travelling across an imaginary line in the forest to a time bout thosand years ago, after stealing a car to get to an aunt in utah to avoid being sent to a foster homeVery lousy movie, should be removed from the shelves. I asked for a refund from shipper and told too bad so threw movie in the trash"
2,A bad film transfer,The source material Alpha Video used to make this DVD is the same as the VHS tape that was circulated a few years back. The picture is a little grainy and the original film to video transfer was poorly executed. The transfer camera was not properly aligned and the tops of people's heads are cut off in medium and close-up scenes. I have purchased a couple of beautiful DVDs from Alpha and I was expecting more. The only reason to buy this one is to have a full length version of the film.
1,"Worst book of the past 2,000 years","This compilation offers no useful insights about invention. The editor solicited comments from the contributors by e-mail. They evidently replied quickly, and made no serious attempt to consider the effect of technology on civilization, nor the effect of their own words on readers.Many of the famous contributors make weak arguments based on blatantly false readings of history and astounding ignorance of science.It is difficult to accept, for example, that the Thermos Bottle is one of the greatest accomplishments of this era. One sage justifies this choice on the basis of an old joke; to ice the cake, a nobel-prize-winning physicist simply concurs with, essentially, ""me too"".The editor demanded no thoughtfulness of his correspondents, and mostly received none.I purchased this volume hoping to learn the origins of inventions, inventors, and inventiveness. Luckily, hope is eternal."
4,Thought-provoking!,"The book is basically just a summary of the exchanges on the Edge mailing list. All the writers have spent some time in their life, thinking about some aspect of humanity in great detail, and all of them have at least published two books.It made me think a lot about life, and many entries in the book are very unobvious. Of course, the average reader will probably not agree with many of the writers' thoughts or opinions. Nevertheless, I would recommend anyone to quickly browse the book to see what are the ideas that have influenced humanity so immensely in the last 2k years."
3,at least it will make you think,"I think that some have been a little harsh as to the merits of this book -- there are those scientists that dashed off hurried responses to the question, but there are just as many others who took the time to write thoughtful essays. Just having the chance to see how scientists and other creative people put their thoughts together makes the book worthwhile reading -- think of it as brain food for your mind. The responses ranged from the more obvious answers like the birth control pill, to more out there ones like the eraser and free will. If nothing else, these essays are written in digestible pieces and provide a good overview of major discoveries since man has inhabited the earth. Most will find it provoking. I'm fairly certain the thermos quote was tongue in cheek."
1,this book makes no sense,have you ever read a book with facts that you know are not true? well if you havent than this is a book that might change that.
4,A masterpiece of ambience.,"This CD is a musical ""Waiting for Godot"": nothing happens. Yet in that aura of nothingness is the entrancing secret of Reich's music. This music works on a subconscious level, washing over the listener and drawing the listener into its spell. Brilliantly intoxicating, this album is a must for anyone who is interested in the world of ambient music."
4,"Useful, but too narrowly focused","This is an extraordinary book coming from the hand of one of the men who once was tasked with carrying out the U.S. SIOP plan. Admiral Turner's analysis and suggestions are timely, especially in the light the slow pace of nuclear arms control and the real threat of nuclear proliferation. The failure of the nuclear superpowers to move more forcefully in reducing their nuclear arsenals lends credence to those new or aspiring nuclear nations to subscribe to the nuclear madness. Admiral Turner raises these issues and the danger of accidental launch and nuclear smuggling in the post Cold War era. However, one can question his advocacy of the wisdom of Ballistic Missile defenses. The abandonment of the ABM treaty could have drastic consequences. However,on balance, Admiral Turner's suggestion that we escrow the nuclear weapons offers intriguing possibilites to break the slow pace of nuclear reduction and elimination."
4,Biased review,"As a contributor to this book, my review is certainly biased, but I nonetheless found the chapters I did not contribute to very useful. This book covers a wide range of research topics from modeling (E/R, UML) to object-oriented considerations, active databases, semi-structured documents (XML), and the web. Each topic is treated through several thourough papers. I recommend it for both advanced database courses/students and researchers."
1,a big disappointment,"Got ""When Jolson Was King"" today. What a disappointment. It's the kind of book you can read straight through at one sitting. Not because it's so engrossing, but because there's so little there.I had hoped for a history of the Jolson era, placing him and his achievements in context and including comments by those who were there. Instead there were often entire (two or three page) chapters on peripherally related people or places without even a relevant Jolson citation. The writing is uninspired and often in need of proof-reading. There are short semi-biographies of Jolson contemporaries, often including only a sentence or two of quotes concerning Jolson. Plus many pages devoted to contemporary Jolson Tribute Artists who are well intentioned and complimentary, never actually met the man.Sorry, but it's a waste of money."
3,A very fine debut !,"A very fine attempt by Pankaj Mishra to mix with the Western soul with that of Eastern. It has the substance. It reflects Mishra's supreme gift of observing things. A finely observed and composed attempt to present the amalgamation of the two opposite cultures, though not fully succeeded. A youngster at his early adulthood though buried with his own world of books, he cannot escape the worldly matters around him. After all, it's due and you have to pass this life in one-way or the other. Probably, this is the main theme, which Mishra wants to depict through Samar.In all it concludes that souls are souls. It cries in personal losses, pain, separations, loneliness and relishes in happiness, in company with his near and dear ones. No matter the person is in West or East. In the end the past lives. It's not dead. It comes around in one way or the other in our future lives.Very fine first attempt, Mr Mishra.Thank You."
1,:(,It was pretty boring stuff.. Like someone pointed out the same old formula all over again. And not even improvised..
1,boring and cliched,"The Romantics is a disappointing book on all fronts. In fact it is a pale story told in a slow and boring manner. It seems that Mishra is trying to fit into the boots of Ruth Jhabawala and other authors who used backdrops of exotic and queer India, an image which probably fascinates the west. However the net effect left me cold and yawning. The mix of Americans and Europeans intermingling with Indians in tourist spots of India like Varanasi and Dharamsala seems real formula stuff. Wonder why Mishra was hyped as the great Indian writer. To me this was the most inspid and uninspiring piece of writing.Maybe mishra should read more Rushdie and Seth and even Shobaha De. At least their works are readable. His book is the most tedious piece of writing I have come across...."
4,"Simple story, simply written, simply profound","Pankaj Mishra's novel moved me deeply. The simple story, simply told, of Samar's growing awareness, rings true. While reflecting a young Indian man's perception of both his own culture and that of the west, the story is universal. I appreciate that characters, both Indian and western, are never ""cardboard"", or easy targets. They seem to spring from the author's real experiences, even if they may be fictitious. As a westerner, I was easily able to identify with the lead character, Samar. The book also made me reflect upon my own life. I loved ""The Romantics""."
1,A personal milestone reached ...,"Isn't it fascinating that while Samar strikes a chord with the ""firangis"" reading The Romantics, while the average desi reader is still wondering what all the hoopla's about? Mishra has quite admirably crossed the divide. If you are looking for a book on India, look elsewhere. Pondicherry, Benaras could be Poughkeepsie, Boston and it wouldn't effect the story. In fact, the latter setting would probably enable the story to ""ring true"" and help the target audience to better ""identify"" with Samar.On the other hand, if you're looking for a mediocre love story set in India, watch a hindi movie with subtitles... Bollywood has much better ware to offer."
1,Nothing memorable about this!,"Pankaj Mishra belongs to that breed of Anglophiles who do not know their own world, excepting through the glasses of a Westerner. This handicaps his powers of observation and description a great deal. He uses a stale plot as a crutch to give substance to his vision, and this makes for a failed book."
4,Evoking ...,"I found this book extremely well written and thought provoking. The author, making an excellent debut, does justice to combining frustrations and dreams that almost all Indian youths face. He then goes on to address the different ways in which different characters in the book, foreign and Indian, deal with life and eventually themselves. Truly a good read!"
5,A wonderful book,"I can't believe what these other reviewers have been saying about the book. I couldn't put it down, and the amazing thing is that the book has no conventional plot or anything, but it just takes you in with its deceptively calm prose and subtle perceptions, keeps you engaged. A triumph in all senses of the word."
5,A Beautiful book,Reading this book was pure pleasure. I wasn't aware that I was reading a novel. I am not a reader of novels but something about this book moved me from the very first page and kept me gripped until the end. A powerful emotional experience is how I would describe it.
3,Decent.,"This stuff is decent for a dry mouth. It's very ""gelly"" (hence the name) and doesn't taste all that great, but it does an alright job."
3,How about a CD?,"A monumental piece of work. Bet you never imagined there could be over 200 000 of these things, eh? The book is a testament to the increasing specialisation of society. The authors have chosen their data from over 80 fields. Clearly, they had to draw the line somewhere. So they chose the most common or important fields, in their estimation. But you have to imagine that had they chosen another 200 fields, the book might be easily twice as thick.Yes, people do like to read a book, as opposed to reading the same material on a computer screen. But for reference subjects like this, one has to wonder if a DVD might not suffice. After all, who is going to read such a reference from page to page?And a DVD enables computer searching. Far better than any index."
5,Hard to find song,I loved this song when i was a teenager and could not find the CD because the CD did not do well and i finally found the single here!! Awesome!
3,Troop for a trooper.,"I was in the Army when I first listened to this CD. Of course back then , I'm sure it was more like a cassette. Either way , each song brings back special memories of a special time in my life. Which is why I give a 3 instead of an honest 2.As far as this 3rd Troop installment goes , the songs seem somewhat dated. Especially with the heavy keyboard implementations , that were popular at the time ( via Keith Sweat and all groups of the early 90's ).However , two songs in particuliar , stand out with "" Come Back to Your Home "" and "" Sweet November "".If anything , this cd is a great throwback for nostalgia and/or any Troop fan."
5,Great Product,We are very pleased with this product! It works great and was very easy to install. I would highly recommend this product.
1,OMG! how terrible can you get?,"Please be advised this is just my personal opinion. I dowloaded this album a few days ago because it kept comming up as an artist like Evanescence and Within Temptation. THEY WISH! this has to be some of the worst musc i have ever heard; it litraly makes me sick at my stomach when i listen to it. there is nothing really wrong the vocals, the music i guess is related to Indirock, i just Don't likr it, and i am not terribly picky about music; i like many diffrent kinds. just not this. once again bare in mind that this is my opinion only. i am SURE there are many who LOVE this music. but take it from me if you like gothic metal (nightwish, WT and Evanescence) don't try this one. save your money for somthing better."
2,Not metal and not very good,"I heard all about Lacuna Coil and decided to get this album and check them out. Well, I was incredibly let down. This album (and only this album since I'm not a long time fan) was nothing like what I hoped it would be. All of the songs seem to sound the same and it is not ""Metal"" like many people have said it was. If this is your first time listening to this band, I would say that you should listen to their old stuff first."
3,"Very listenable, but aren't we just waiting for Evanescence to come back?","This band, having just heard them recently for the first time, are very listenable. However, I can't help but feel like they are a subpar Evanescence, which in itself is a female-led Linkin Park which in itself is a rap/rock/pop amalgamation of many bands without a significant sound . . . alas I sound like a hater, but the truth is, call it a guilty pleasure, I do enjoy Evanescence the most out of the three. Her voice is simply beautiful, no matter how processed their look and image on Mtv (which South Park got exactly correct: ""We manipulate 12 year olds and tell them what is cool"").So I will enjoy this disc as I have been, but probably won't reach for it out of my more than 13,000 songs, but if it comes on the ipod shuffle, I won't skip it, but I may skip to Evanescence after it is done."
3,Italian Evanescence,"This CD from Lacuna Coil sounds like Evanescence to me. That's not a bad thing, but it's far from fresh or original. It does have a slightly European flair in the rhythm that helps separate it from other manufactured goth-pop-rock. Overall a disappointment, because I heard a lot of hype about this band and album that's really nothing special."
2,Karmacode,"Comalies was such an outstanding album, so the next album should be even better. Its not. They start out with the male singer and he is not really the best singer in the world. He sounds like he should be in a cover band instead. Cristina Scabbia's voice is the reason to buy this cd. What a great voice she has. I think if they replaced the male singer with a better singer, then this band would sky rocket to fame. A decent cd but I think its more of a step back then foward. Better luck next time."
1,Highly disappointed,"Lacuna Coil has lost it. The magic, the mesmerizing ambience due to Lillo's vocals is gone. This is a messy album highly dominated by mallcore sound and too distant from ""In A Reverie"" or ""Unleashed Memories"" to be taken as coming from the same band. Even the song in Italian ('Without Fear') has nothing of the magic of 'Senzafine'. The only song truly LC in my opinion is 'Within Me', and yet has not the fire of 'To Myself I Turn' or 'Falling Again'.Unless you are a hardened fan or very open to a band falling into the mainstream I recommend to avoid this one."
2,A big disappointment,"I bought this album, expecting to hear more of the great music I liked so much in Lacuna Coil's previous albums, especially Comalies. Instead, what I heard was a bunch of dumbed down Korn-style rap metal with Eastern influences and female vocals. If it wasn't for Cristina's voice, the album would have sounded like a completely different band. The music no longer has that melodic composition and complex sonic texture that made me like Comalies from the moment I heard it. Instead, I hear repeated monotonous guitar and rhythm styles, combined with Christina and Andrea singing often in unison, which only results in them drowning out each other's voice. There's absolutely nothing in this album that would make me want to keep listening to it."
3,"Good songs, good production but awful mix!!","I like the songs of this record, even more than Comalies, they're less '80 pop metal but still catchy.I also like the sound of the instruments one by one, but the mix is really confused, It's a hard work to listen to it, too messy and muddy, it does't sound as modern as the arrangements pretend to be, I can't linsten to it in my car, too much bass, no definition and Cristina's voice breaks my eardrums even if i's really low in the mix, especially in Within Me.I guess the man who mixed this album is not really used to work on modern stuff, and the volume is really low, it has half the volume of Paul McCartney's ""Chaos and creation"" that is ACOUSTIC!!!But I love the songs!! My favourites are:1 What I See2 To The Edge3 Fragments Of Faith4 Devoted5 Enjoy The SilenceI appreciate the band's effort to change direction from the past albums, but I hope the next album will sound less confused than this muddy one."
2,An Empty Spiral,"I've been a fan of Lacuna Coil for several years now and have seen them live. They're a great band. I was really drawn to the unique sound of their early work (pre-Comalies). I thought Comalies was OK, but kind of a step in the wrong direction as it sounded a lot more commercial than previous works. Unfortunately, Karmacode takes this once unique and great band deeper into the commercial, overproduced, GENERIC metal sound. Nothing on this new CD sets Lacuna Coil apart from the masses of similar-sounding bands out there. I don't find even one song on this new CD appealing or interesting in any way. Lots of overdone synth, rumbling bass and for heaven's sake, a Depeche Mode cover?! I won't bother to see them on the Karmacode tour. This band peaked with ""Unleashed Memories""...that is their masterpiece. I love that CD. ""In A Reverie"" is also very good. Save your money (and spare yourself a heartbreak) Karmacode is a disappointment that is destined for the ""used CD"" bargain bins."
3,"A mixed bag, definitely not their best album","I absolutely love Unleashed Memories and Comalies, they are two incredibly solid albums. Karmacode on the other hand? Well, it's not really a bad album, per se. However, I feel that it definitely could have been better, a lot better. Some of the songs are a bit dull, although there are also some great songs on the album. My personal favorites on the album are: ""Within Me"", ""Our Truth"", ""Without Fear"", ""Closer"", and the cover song ""Enjoy the Silence""."
3,Close but no cigar,I have been a fan of lacuna coil since their first ep which is their best material.This album good but sounds like lacuna coil are trying to sound mainstream.The songs are good but some songs like the game and within me sound like (gulp) evanensence! and another problem the album missing a good track without a reason off the our truth single which should have been on this album because it sounds like old lacuna coil era unleashed memories.For new fans of the band you love this album but for long time fans like me its a let down really and sorry for the heresy of saying they sound like evenansence im so sorry lacuna coil.If you want to hear lacuna coil at their best check out unleashed memories or the lacuna coil ep.
5,"""Karmacode"" is excellent!","""Karmacode"" is excellent! Lacuna Coil is one of the best heavy metal bands of our time.Track Listing:1. Fragile2. To The Edge3. Our Truth4. Within Me5. Devoted6. You Create7. What I See8. Fragments Of Faith9. Closer10. In Visible Light11. The Game12. Without Fear13. Enjoy The Silence (Depeche Mode cover song)Tracks that I enjoyed: All of them!"
2,Leaning towards selling out.,"Comalies is one of my favorite albums and this follow up album just doesn't cut it. It is more ""poppish"" and has lost some of the dark, mysterious, gothic edge that Comalies has. If your a big Comalies fan then Karmacode will not satisfy."
1,A Tepid Disappointment,"As a long-time fan of the band, I cannot begin to convey how disappointing this CD is. Nothing more than a lame attempt at cannibalizing themselves and ripping-off American Nu-Metal. This does not even come close to the genius that is In a Reverie and Unleashed Memories. People singing the praises of this release need to have their heads examined. This CD has already been placed into File 13 among my collection. Long-time fans interested in checking out something refreshing should give the new Angtoria or Novembre a spin."
4,"Well done, yet feels short","This was my first Lacuna Coil CD that I had heard... Each of the tracks is rather well produced and the sounds are quite beautiful with very fitting vocals. I find that I like both the male and female vocals of this group, partially due to the effective contrast created with them!The only real downside that I've found to this album is that every time I listen to it I'm disappointed when it ends! Each of the tracks is short and sweet... Now I just need more of their CDs. ;)"
2,What happened?,This group used to really have a talent for goth/industrial/rock music. And now this? There isn't really anything on this album that gets me going nor does it touch me in any way.Just get a TCR's album 'The Chrome Recordings'.... better sound better choice. t-c-r.net
3,Cute,"Really geared to middle-teens, but recommended for Terry Partchett fans anyway (probably rates 5 stars for kids)"
4,nice work from lc,"a real good album to listen to while driving.. never get bored of it , it has its diversity ...."
3,Lacuna Coil - Polished For The Masses,"This album was a pretty big letdown for me. The album is not terrible, but it really comes across like the band (or probably the record company) attempted to put together a more commercial release that might be embraced by radio or MTV. The songs here are all very polished and there is a lot of sameness to the material. This is homogenized Lacuna Coil built for the mass demographic. There are some decent songs here, but everything kind of blends into everything else. There are no standouts like can be usually found on Lacuna Coil albums. The songwriting on this one is very middle of the road too. In fact the best song on the disc is a cover of Depeche Mode's ""Enjoy The Silence"" that comes off really well. ""Karmacode"" is not a bad album, but it is far from the band's best. If you are looking to check this band out I would recommend ""Comalies"" instead."
4,Ah-Bas Noir,"Some great early 90's dance music..these two young ladies had strong voices, but what happened to them? 'Superficial Love' did get some airplay in my area but i don't know how well it did nationally.. the 90's for me was a decade with alot of bad music!but this release was one of the few dance cd's(with some ballads)that was good!"
4,"A bit uneven, but a great tribute","""Rumors"" is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I approached this tribute with trepidation -- not necessary. I don't care for a couple of the covers (especially Shawn Colvin's sickly version of what is probably the greatest song on ""Rumors"", The Chain), but most of them are very good. In particular Tonic's ""Second Hand News"", Elton John's ""Don't Stop"" (of course, Elton John could sing the Greater London phone book and I'd be first in line to get the CD), and above all Sister Hazel's version of ""Gold Dust Woman"", which approaches the original in outstanding excellence. I miss Fleetwood Mac, and this is a fine reminder."
1,Dissappointment,"As a casual fan of Fleetwood Mac, I thought this album had potential. As I listened to it, I realized how insulting this really is. Absolutely none of the songs do justice to the original versions. Elton John's rendition of Don't Stop, was particularly hideous. The Cranberries did a little better on ""Go Your Own Way."" Shawn Colvin managed to ""loungify"" one of the greatest songs ever written, ""The Chain."" By far, the best tribute on this album is The Corrs beautiful ""Dreams."" Tribute albums should reflect the passion the singer has for the artist they are honoring. This album does no such thing."
5,Truly a great CD!,This is an outstanding CD and truly a worthy tribute to a sensational group of performers. These are songs that we have grown up with and now new hit artists bring them to life again and let us listen to these classics for the first time again.
3,It could be better,"This tribute has some ups and downs. Some versions, like ""Dreams"" have become new ""classics"" while others, like ""Songbird"" are forgettable. The original album has so many great songs that the comparison is inevitable between the old one and this one. Unfortunatelly. not all the artists invited were up to the task of recreating this amazing work. I would still buy this product, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is not a Fleetwood Mac fan."
1,WORTHLESS album! I wish ZERO stars were an option!!!!,"How could such a great combination of songs and singers turn out so badly??? The whole album sounds thrown-together, as if most of the songs were recorded in just in one take with no rehearsals. Sister Hazel's performance of ""Gold Dust Woman"" is at least decent (and I am a BIG Sister Hazel fan!), but frankly, that isn't one of the best songs from Rumours anyway. And Duncan Sheik (whom I normally like very much) absolutely MASSACRES ""Songbird"" -- I can't even stand to listen to it. Elton John does an unusually lousy job, too -- the words of ""Don't Stop"" are almost unintelligible. I am so glad I bought my copy really cheap on ebay, because I couldn't re-sell it and am throwing it out!"
4,bigger then expected,"This thing is fairly huge...bigger then expected as described by the measurements. We mix dough in it and it contains the mess, but takes up tons of space in the fridge."
5,Strategic Alliances Among Health and Human Services Organizations,"Great up to date information. I would recommend this book to those who are looking for options to review for the best ""strategic alliance"" for their facility."
1,Great Film Poor Transfer,"This film stands along side Seven Samurai and Ikiru as a truly magnificent production. I own it on vhs and purchased the Dvd with delight only to be shocked by the extremely poor digital video and audio transfer. Many shots are multiple imaged and clipped. The dialogue is bearly understandable. Finally, as a person who speaks and reads Japanese fluently I must tell you the translation subtitling is very, very poor. Frankly, save your money."
4,Ted Hughes' Selected Poems,"This volume collects a representative and handy group of poems by Ted Hughes, a must have if you like his work"
5,BZ fan.,"This is a timeless, beautiful album. I had this album years ago and lost it. It took years of searching to replace it. I won't lose this one! All the songs are beautifully written and recorded. They are also unforgettable. The title song ""My Time"" is haunting and lovely, while others such as ""Dinah Flo"" and ""Might Have To Cry"" are more rock/blues. Also, ""Freedom For The Stallion"" and ""Slowly In The West"" are absolute gems. Gems!You'll be very happy you purchased this CD, and you'll enjoy it for years to come! One of Boz's best!"
4,A Lost Boz Scaggs Classic Album,"Along with the album ""Moments"", the album ""My Time"" is one ofBoz Scaggs lost classics. ""My Time"" contains two excellent rock songs, ""Dinah Flo"" and ""Full Lock Power Slide"" that alone make thealbum worth buying. While Dinah Flo is available on Boz ""Hits!""album and the ""My Time"" anthology, ""Full Lock Power Slide"" is sadlymissing. Full Lock is reminiscent of Boz ""Dime-a-Dance Romance"" done with Steve Miller.My Time also contains a number of other fine songs including a nice cover of Al Green's ""Old Time Lovin'"".My Time made the transition to CD before Columbia/Sony allowed it to be dropped from their catalog. It is a worthwhile listen if you can obtain a copy. Hopefully it will be re-issued again."
5,Finally available for download,"Awesome! I've been waiting years for this amazing album to be available for digital download. This is my all-time favorite Boz Scaggs album, so soulful, with that great Muscle Shoals production quality holding it all together. My favorite tracks: He's A Fool For You; Freedom For The Stallion; Might Have To Cry; Dinah Flo; Full-Lock Power Slide. There's not a single bad track, here. Enjoy!"
3,"A nice album - 3,5 STARS",In the begging i didn't like this album at all .By reading those good reviews hear i thought to try hearing this album some times. Well i have to say that im now between its just ok and i like it. Personally i like Morning sun and the storm very much and the other tracks are just ok. Its not Savatage best (Gutter Ballet) but it is a good album for Savatage fans.
5,Classic Savatage,"Savatage continues their quest as Americas most underappreciated band. If you are a fan, this album is a must. Another concept album that is on the mark. With well thought out lyrics, classic musical references, this bandcontinues to evolve as the premier band of today. Savatage does NOT dissapoint!"
3,What Next? Marco Polo?,"Kidding aside, Savatage have decided (some time ago actually) that they had to be taken seriously. So from the ashes of a pretty-boy 80's band rose this version of Savatage. The sound is very reminiscent of those times. Heavy rock, ballads, and, oh yes, the hair. But gone are the paeans to promiscuity, and here come the deep concepts. You will sometimes see Savatage filed in the progressive genre. I suppose this is a matter of definition. The music is just heavy rock with minimal prog leanings, but the carefully scripted concepts give it the depth to classify it among the typically progressive albums. The lyrics about the cirumnavigation are very gripping and the CD booklet is very impressive, but the music really fails to touch me. Very insipid rock, formulaic and staid."
5,Oh My Goodness!,"This album is stupid nice! Keith is back, and on top of his game like he standin on XBox. Jamie Foxx is on the interludes which is funny as hell. The Beats on this album are nice & the lyrics are hard! Keith is spittin crazy. Go get this, a true hip hop album."
4,He's Keith Murray,"Keith Murrays Def Jam debut was not great but it was pretty good. There are quite a few good songs on the album and a few that he should have left off. Don't hesitate though, if you are a Hip Hop then you will most likely enjoy the album. Buy it!"
3,Pray for Keith,"This is not a typical Keith Murray Album. He is obviously trying to make a commercial friendly album with as many radio cuts as possible. It's not what I want out of Keith Murray album but it's easy for me to talk cuz I'm not Keith. Keith has three successful Albums out and he is still broke. He's got attorney fees, and a bad reputation in the industry. I don't blame him for trying this kind of Album. People have to eat. Pray for Keith that he can find that happy medium between artistic integrity and financial success."
3,A Solid Product From Keith Murray,"While not as groundbreaking as some of his earlier albums, this one will satisfy any true rap fan. My favorite guest spot was Busta Rhymes but Erick Sermon did a great job too though. No need to worry. Keith Murray himself is still on point with the rhymes even though the beats may seem more on the flashy, poppy side. If you like this, check out The Most Beautifullest Thing In This World, It's A Beautiful Thing, Enigma, and Rapmurrphobia. All good collections. Keith Murray is a rapper who is part of Def Squad along with Redman and Erick Sermon, who both also bring you similar hip hop flavor. Keith debuted in the mid 90s but was probably developing his rapping skills earlier than that (close to old school times) so he is no newcomer, or rookie, to the game. Check it out."
4,Not bad,"My grocery store stopped carrying my favorite sweet chili sauce, and I couldn't remember the name to look it up on line. I only remembered that it was Thai, and red, and the bottle resembled this one. This is not bad, but not great. Very chunky with slivers of carrots and such, so good for cooking, but not great as a dip."
4,Adesso Touchpad keyboard review,"This is a very nice keyboard for someone who does not have a desk for their computer. I like it for the most part, touch pad works natively in both Windows XP and in Ubuntu 10.04 without having to install anything. Of course nothing is perfect, there are a few negatives. Once using Windows XP, for some odd reason, the back button stopped working, but then when I booted into Ubuntu, it worked fine, so I believe its a compatibility issue with XP. I managed to fix this with a reboot, and this problem has only happened once and never again. Also once and a while the touch pad doesnt move as fast as it should, but after playing with the pad for a few seconds, it kind of ""wakes"" the mouse back up. Anyway for the most park it works great, and I cant complain, I would def recommend it"
5,better than the stuff with fake fat,"thank you Amazon! I used to purchase this product at Whole Foods then they stopped carrying it. Now I purchase it from you by the case, it's stays fresh and I save money to boot. If you don't mind leaving out the oil and butter from your popcorn, this one's for you."
4,Bearitos Microwave Popcorn,"The corn, in each bag, nearly all pops. Before opening the popped bag, I would shake it, to distribute the salt equally through the product. The popped corn is crisp, and fresh tasting. I would buy this product again."
2,GOOD but there are better-tasting alternatives (and just as healthy),"This product is good, but tastes rather bland. I reviewed the label and compared it to other brands. Here are some alternative:- Orville Redenbacher's ""Light Natural"" has fewer calories, the same amount of fat/sodium, better flavoring (palm oil), larger bags (3.3 vs 2.8 oz), and costs approximately half as much since Redenbacher frequently goes on sale. IMHO the ""light natural"" variety is a more attractive choice.- Healthy Choice Popcorn is another alternative with many of the same benefits listed above, although I don't think it tastes as good as Redenbacher's ""Light Natural"" brand.I won't be buying anymore of Bearito's, not because there's anything wrong with it, but just because there are better-tasting options that are just as healthy. :-)"
3,Not solid wood,"The Home Decorators website says this dresser is solid wood. It isn't, unless you consider composite wood to be solid, which I don't. Too bad, it is mostly solid wood (the sides are composite, the back is particle bd, and I'm not sure about the dresser front) and looks very attractive in the photos. It seems to be mostly well constructed. I wish they hadn't lied about the materials. Now I have to consider whether it is worth it to return it, especially if I have to pay part or all of the shipping."
1,Fraudulent Reviews?,"The first two reviewers (at bottom of list) both reviewed Bissell products exclusively, providing rave reviews. I am suspicious of these reviewers in that they reviewed 2-3 Bissel vacuums in their other reviews. Note both reviews posted on the same day -- click the ""see other reviews"" to check it out for yourself."
1,Drowning in the Sea of Bombs,"Let me just say first and foremost: I think Ringo is very underappreciated but this album does not do Ringo justice. Ringo the 4th was the 2nd album in his triple threat of bombs before he released the excellent Stop and Smell the Roses in 1981.I bought this album bundled with Ringo's Rotogravure and I can say about the only song on the 4th that I actually liked was ""Drowning in the Sea of Love"". Other than that, every other song is worse than the last one.It almost hurts to give a Ringo album one star because he is a truly talented musician...but like I said, this album does Ringo no justice and should be avoided like the plague.Pick up ""Ringo"", ""Goodnight Vienna"" or ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" instead."
4,Not That Bad,"This album has a poor reputation, and I'm not going to defend it too much. There are a lot of terrible and cheesy moments throughout (the lead track, Tango All Night, Can She Do It Like She Dances; Out on the Streets is the worst), but Ringo is actually in a good vocal form throughout, and the songwriting isn't too bad.the ballads all work really well, especially. Wings, Gave It All Up, It's No Secret, and Gypsies in Flight are all nice songs.True, this album won't ever be classic, but it is a little bit better than camp. Maybe I'm just hopelessly endeared to Ringo's music, but this ain't so bad."
3,Ringo plays the disco diva role to perfection,"Ringo steps comfortably into the disco spotlight with a remarkably hip album that showcases his brilliance as a dancefloor diva. Behind pulsating rhythms and funkified beats, Ringo demonstrates his intention to become a major player on the disco scene, serving notice to Donna Summer and her ilk on songs such as ""Drowning in a sea of love"" and ""Can she do it like she dances"". If you don't own a pair of platform boogie shoes, you'll be racing to the nearest footwear retailer after spinning this fantastically danceable disc!"
3,An easy listen,"Featuring some of the most souful and gutsy vocals Ringo Starr ever recorded, RINGO THE 4TH makes its way to my turntable again and again, some 22 years since I first bought the album. The then-contemporary lush, disco-flavored sound of producer Arif Mardin and some hot guitar playing by David Spinozza anchor most of the tracks. Ringo fans will note that RINGO THE 4TH departs from Starr's formula of superstar guest appearances, songs written by other ex-Beatles, and remakes of classic oldies. While not among the best Ringo Starr albums, RINGO THE 4TH is an easy listen."
4,Sweet doll!,Really sweet doll and the best one I could find for a child 6 months old. No Choking Hazard. Soft body and totally machine washable which is great for an infant that puts everything in her mouth. I was concerned about the vanilla smell at first. I was afraid it my cause allergy problems. The scent is so light that it has not been a problem.
5,Perfect doll for baby,This doll is perfect for baby due to its soft body and light weight. Easy for little hands to hold.
4,Baby Doll,"This doll is very soft and cute. Just the right size for my 1 year old granddaughter. It is a gift for Christmas, and I think she will love it."
1,two and a half toddler rejects pillow,"My grandaughter looked at the doll, gave it a hug and then threw it down and picked up another stuffed toy. It was definitely too small to use for a pillow - you must have been measuring the overall doll not the pillow. This is the first thing from Amazon I have not been happy with."
3,Still problems with the right hand in 2012,"This is a very cute doll, and it does smell like vanilla. I have read the reviews from 2009 about the doll's right hand not staying in the mouth, but thought the problem was probably solved. However, the doll I got in 2012 had the right hand that wouldn't even reach the mouth the way it is pictured. For me, the cute little hand in the mouth was one of the selling points, and I was disappointed to see that the right hand is like a regular doll's, and the left one is sewn to the doll's body. I would have given this doll 5 stars, and I wish the manufacturer/seller would provide a more accurate picture of the doll."
3,Low budget indie melodrama,"Despite Josh Brolin's presence, this indie film smacks of low budget, though its tale of revenge, with a love triangle on the side, makes for pleasant viewing. Set in the Florida Panhandle, the film doesn't make very clear what the central character wants from the two evil marina guys, though he seems to want some money owed him before he went to prison for some drug activities. The action parts of the film are the weak link, but the character development of the love triangle participants is decently done. Recommended."
3,Everyone has to start somewhere,"A much, much older Timothy Oliphant movie. Great fun to go back in time and watch if you have seen and loved his more recent stuff. If you are new to Timothy don't start with this one. It is for die hard fans only."
5,"Film by Victor Nunez, Oliphant is the lead",Wish amazon could show more care in their labeling.Great film with all the quiet power one expects from thethe maker of Ruby in Paradise and Ulees Gold.Wish I could my hands on his later Spoken Word :(
3,coastlines,enjoyed but love it fairly ok but mostly not too outstanding the film arrived on time and in good shape cant figger why the hell i bought it in the first place?
1,Very Average/Dull/. The norm of today,"Seems to be a Cult-type out of the 70'sOh brother.Not a chipper productionThey learned their lessons, perhaps"
4,"Excellent, but outdated.","This book is loaded with useful information, some of which can't be found elsewhere. Unfortunately, the pub date is 1994, which probably means it was written in 1993. Few people had even heard of the internet at that time, and the Ross's references to it are slight and incomplete. The internet revolution has completely transformed the self-publishing landscape -- this book even lacks up-to-date online addresses, etc. Frankly, I was distressed when I realized how far behind the times this volume really is. The Rosses ""owe"" the world a completely revised edition, dealing with the publishing universe as it now is. Otherwise, this book should come with a warning: ""Terrific, but out of date."" Len Lamensdorf"
5,The book that started me in the publishing business!,"This is one of the best books ever written on the subject of self-publishing. It has absolutely everything you need to know in order to successfully self-publish and market your own book. With determination, I took a step in faith and self-published my first book with the guidance of Marilyn and Tom Ross. Today, as the owner of Rainbow's End Publishing, ... I take pride in the fact that I have published the works of many authors throughout the United States. Whether you publish one book for yourself, or become a publisher for others, do a professional job by following the advice given in this book."
2,Not quite updated in these times,"While the context is materially correct, self publishing has outdated this printed version by 27 years. It does not approach the newer age of self publishing, e-book format or any of the varieties of the strains of self publishing!"
2,Thin,"The sweater I received was extremely thin: I had expected something more like an LL Bean cardigan, which I dearly love. I was wrong. What do I do now?Roger Hampton(503)293-5655ov10abronco@juno.com"
4,fantasy island,"This story feels a bit more grown-up than the usual for the genre, with Blair, the heroine, thirty and recovering from a recent divorce. Her hero, one Hugh Bannatyne, is a mystery man who turns up like the fantasy he is, offering consolation, comfort and adult companionship. The story is good, nice to read and the tension well generated over Hugh's status in life (is he married or isn't he?). Donald takes a stand on an ethical issue which you might not agree with and whether you do or not will have an impact on how you see the rationale behind the story. A character from a previous book (Tamsyn Chapman, who had the sort of integrity you could bruise yourself on), is the one who pumps the ethically dubious line, which does tend to ring a little untrue. Still, if you've not come across Mrs Chapman's previous incarnation, then you won't mind. A great setting on a made-up South Sea island adds to the fun"
1,Polly Shang Kwan and Dorian Tan team up to take on Lung Fei,So this movie is basically just a very bad version of Joseph Kuo's 'Unbeaten 28'. Tis movie was probably made first but the sets look to be from the 20's. Polly Kwan looks great like always but Tan doesn't get to show off too much. Basically the story is that he finds out his dad turned to stone a long time ago and is a statue now. He learns from his stone dad and his stone friends and then goes to help Polly Kwan take on Lung Fei. This movie is truly about as bad as you can get. The only thing I enjoyed was watching one of my favorite females tear people up and Lung Fei uses one of the most laughable weapons ever in the finale.Only 79 minutes long and it is all the better for it. Picture quality from Video Asia is not the worst but it is a pretty bad pan and scan job though you do get to see most of the action.
3,Better Than I Thought It Would Be,I was happily surprised to find out this collection by Kwame and A New Beginning is a lot better than I thought it might have been considering it comes after the success of A Boy Genius and Pokadelik Adventure and sometimes artists have a hard time topping their last work. This is a fantastic album from rap's early era. Very unique. I might even say it is better than Pokadelik but to say that for sure I have to go back and listen to that one again. I especially like the sample of The Meters that they use here that Naughty By Nature also used for Feel Me Flow from their Poverty's Paradise album. Coincidence? Or inspiration from Kwame and company to another one of rap's greatest groups to date?
2,not a cook book,"It's an interesting book, lots of blather. i bought it hoping to find interesting recipes for a Mediterranean diet. There are a couple, but you have to plow through an enormous amount of memorabilia, blather, etc. Try something else."
5,In a league of its own,"This is a work of real originality, with extremely informative text and a profusion of tantalizing recipes that provide an ""open sesame"" to great eating."
1,Load times ruin it.,"The load times are simply unbearable, regardless of game play. to have to wait 2-3 minutes to start and in between matches is unacceptable. The devs should be embarrassed."
4,Great Game ..... Really !!!,This Is A Really Excellant Game ..... The Only Negative With This Game is The Really Poor Load Times. Everything else Really Runs Well .... The Graphics are great and there are many cool tunes the enterances which take a long time to load are Very Realistic ..... Overall a 4 Star is in order.
5,One of the best,When i bought this game i wanted to try it right away.I tryed it and man it rocked.i really love it but the only thing i do not like is how long it takes to load.it is very fun and i would reccomend it.overall it is awesome.
4,* All That You Can Ask For,I personally love this game. I am a handheld and wrestling fan so I knew this was a must have. There are awesome features such as gm mode and all the matches that are in the ps2 version. If you love wrestling games and have a psp you must buy this. Don't worry about season because 2 full non-reapeting season modes appear in the psp version. S.vs.R for psp is a BODY SLAM IN YOUR POCKET!!!
1,Far Fetched and Hokey,As a real Texan who has lived in the state my entire life I find the characters and dialogue absurd. The idea that after people read the story they may actually think Texans are like that is embarrasing. The scenes jump too much and the dialogue isn't smooth so that you have to go back and re-read to see what is inferred. The hero is unappealing and I kept hoping in vain that the heroine would dump him. I don't know why I even finished the book. I would not recommend anyone read this one.
2,Not at His Best,"I agree with everything that the previous reviewer says about Jimmy Yancey, but I don't agree that it applies to THIS album. It was recorded only a few weeks before his death and finds him clearly very ill and only a shadow of his former self.They are interesting recordings, and Mama Yancey is in fine form, but anyone wanting to hear performances by Yancey that justify the rave review given below should listen to one of the Document CDs, preferably Vols 2 or 3."
1,Very Poor,First off all this could of been put on two discs.Half of the demonstrations the camera is behind the tattoo artist hand their for you cant see.In my opinion Gary Grays lines were very poor on the other hand Paul Millers demonstrations were good the only problem is that he only appears in two segments.Production is also poor.I'm up set I paid $100 in my opinion $40 maybe.I should of taken the advice from another web site.
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"All on this disc are master musicians. If you like what they're doing, they're doing it very well. I guess I prefer Indian movie singing to be accompanied by an Indian movie."
5,Clasic Jam from the King Of Pop,Beat It broke down many doors with the Guitar Solo Of Eddie Van halen&the Urgency vocals of Michael Jackson. this song still is tight. a strong concept that spoke out against violence. a good message that had a song that packed a heck of a punch. Michael Jackson knocked this song out of the box. Props to the KING OF POP!!!!!!!
4,Nice,"I bought it because of ""Oro"" which I think is great. The other songs are okay. Her style reminds me of Enya."
5,Ageless and Beautiful Music,"It's hard for me to believe that nearly 10 years have passed since this album was released. Maire Brennan, lead vocalist of Clannad, has a voice that is both ethereal and powerful at the same time. She has the ability to move me to tears even while singing in a language of which I have only minimal understanding (Irish gaelic). This particular album has several pieces that are quite beautiful and relaxing ... they would work nicely as lullabies. Brennan's skill as a harpist is also shown to great advantage on many tracks. Not to be missed if you are an admirer of Celtic New Age music."
3,PAWNS MOVE,A GOOD CHRISTIAN THEMED MOVIE; somewhat weak in its overall storyline and leads to believe it is more idealistic than realistic.
3,Dog Gets Out,"After 1 week my 9 month puppy worked out how to open the 3 catches on the crate. The first time I thought it was my error. I should have trusted myself, the 2nd time she got out and tore up the fitted carpet. I now use cable wraps each time to ensure a closed door."
3,"Good songs, don't enjoy her voice","I give this 3 stars because unlike many of the children's lullaby CDs, I like the songs she chose. I just don't particularly care for Ms. Graff's voice--I found it slightly unsteady, not always in tune, and while I imagine it would be soothing to an infant (my son is past that age!), I found it distinctly NOT soothing for me."
1,"Flimsy construction, terrible service","1. The left control key is in the wrong place, making it very frustrating to execute keyboard shortcuts like control-c, control-v for cut/paste.2. The touchpad is almost unuseable, with the cursor frequently jumping across the screen.3. The keyboard feels flimsy and cheap. In fact mine arrived with 2 keys that had fallen off in the mail and the springs underneath were nowhere to be found. I can put the keys back on, but they are useless without the springs.4. Adesso has appalling customer service. Don't expect your email to their service desk to be returned. Calling is not much better: twice, I waited the arrival of replacement springs, after customer service agents promised to send them to me. Its 3 months and I'm still waiting."
1,Touchpad is terrible,"The touchpad started acting up a couple of weeks after I received it, the cursor jumps all over the place. You get what you pay for I guess and I should have known this was junk because of the low price."
5,Use it every day.,An excellent keyboard and touchpad. The extra cost is well-worth the increase in size and usability. We have two in the shop.
4,A great touchpad keyboard--except for the keys.,"I ordered this keyboard because I prefer to use a touchpad rather than a mouse. The Adesso touchpad works perfectly and the glidepoint feature is really useful. You can scroll up or down simply by sliding your finger up or down along the right side of the pad. The size and placement of the keys is fine. The only thing that stopped me from giving a +5 rating is the key action. I'm used to typing fast on a laptop that has a very smooth, light action. The Adesso keys require a much harder touch and when I'm typing fast I tend to skip characters too often so that I have to slow down. Plus, I think the keys are quite noisy compared to other keyboards. The glidepoint feature makes up for the harder-to-use keys, but I would sure like to have both the glidepoint AND quiet keys with a smooth light touch."
4,godly,Good book about a Godly women who endured all kinds of trials and tribulation. She spent some time in prison and wrote of her love for the Lord. She loved God so much and was devoted to her Catholic church.
4,refreshing and interesting read,"In these days of over literal readings of the Bible and reoccuring debates over teaching creationism opposed to Darwininsm in the classroom, you may find this work refreshing. Dr. Swanson presents some credible ideas on science, religion, and reconciliation of the two in our modern world."
4,"Kick a*# rock and roll, just a year too late to make a dent","Second record from great hard rock party band from Holland ... GREAT beer-drinking music, 'gang' backing vocals with traces of Ratt, even Def Leppard, but this band's music is grittier than either. Too bad the Beez didn't get a good push from their label (also would've helped if it was released a year earlier, like it was supposed to be), because this is rockin', heavy commercial rock and roll; not metal but not Trixter either ... 1st track, ""Raise A Little Hell"" is very commercial, as is ""Head To Toe"" (one of my faves), but the rest is raw, in-your-face rock and roll. Included is one emotional power ballad which doesn't detract from the flow of the album. Only track I could lose is maybe ""What's That Smell"", but some may like it. Parts of it remind of Skid Row, other parts of Ratt, but with a gutsy lead voice, and truly crunchy guitars, this album stands the test of time. It's rare, but worth getting ... it's a gem!"
5,Grandson Loves his Bee toy,"My Grandson (Third Generation Beekeeper in training!:-)) LOVES this toy. I also found that the suction cup didn't stick very well. Now, I just run it under the faucet and wipe the high chair tray well, and it sticks fine! I also stick it to the coffee table now that our Grandson is crawling and pulling himself up. He's attracted to the bright colors and loves to teeth on the black pull rings and bee antennas. This toy has been a hit since he was 4 months old and continues to hold his interest at 9 months and starting to stand, walk - holding on to things, etc."
2,wow that's it..... pretty boring,This toy doesn't do much at all..... All my baby does is try to chep on it... she likes her other high chair toys much more.... pass on this one.
3,Where is Buzzy Feiten??,I bought this because a) I heard she had a good voice and b) Buzzy Feiten was listed as a guitarist on the disc. The ONLY song he appears on you can BARELY make out that there is guitar on the song.....VERY wasteful of his immense talent.
5,Qawwali - Sufi Music From Pakistan,"After being a devotee of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Abida Parveen (I love her ""Devotional Journey""), I was unsure about the Sabri Brothers. However this CD impressed me enough that I just ordered Ya Habib and Greatest Hits by the Sabri Brothers. I appreciate the uncompromising genuineness and heart that they put into this work. I have been disappointed in other artists cutting short tracks that don't get to the hypnotic, trance-like quality of qawwali, or who mix in new-age instrumentals (I don't really even like NFAK's ""Night Song"" CD with Michael Brook). This is my favorite type of music, so I highly value finding good new artists in the genre. I would not have found the Sabri Brothers unless I had gone online and searched."
2,"Buyer Beware: This is a ""NAKED"" torch...","I have researched this device, and it appears to NOT include the battery, or charger, even though the picture includes a 12v battery.So, buyer beware: unless you already have a compatible system, this is an incomplete product. FYI!"
4,Satisfied!,Thank you - the light works as expected. I would by this light again and I'd like the option for a new battery too.
5,positive,The items were perfect and exactly what I needed for my original light went bad and wanted to continue to use the rechargeable battery. perfect item.
5,Excellent,"One of there best albums. If you have heard their radio hits ""Round and Round"" or ""Tell Me What Should I See"" from their previous albums, you can expect the same quality from those songs to be on several of these tracks. They were big in Canada (as I have recently read) but never really broke in the USA. Shame really, because their music is refreshing with haunting melodies and very intelligent lyrics."
3,Disappointing,"After listening to the first half of ""Shake Your Spirit"", I'm forced to conclude that it is a disappointment. It is hard to believe this is the same band that delivered the original sound and insightful, incisive lyrics that make every track on the self-titled album, ""Frozen Ghost"", a favorite even after 20 years. By comparison, the lyrics on ""Shake Your Spirit"" seem like fluff. And the music, at least through the lens of 2008, seems derivative.This is not a bad album and I'll listen to the rest, but I don't foresee it joining my my favorites list. I'd suggest skipping this one in favor of ""Frozen Ghost"" if you can find it or ""The Essentials"" if you can't. ""The Essentials"" appears to include a number of good tracks from ""Frozen Ghost"" and presumably the best ones from ""Shake Your Spirit""."
5,Don't Sleep On This One!!,"Don't Sleep on this album! It's one of the best albums out now and T.I. is a very underrated rapper. He's got nice beats and he really represents the south in this album. 24's, No More Talk, I Still Luv You, Trap Muzik, Be Easy, and Doin My Job are my favorites, but the whole CD is tight. If you haven't bought this CD buy it now!"
5,A great yarn!!!,"I'll admit that I bought this mostly because Elizabeth is a friend, and that I'm not usually a reader of YA. But I swear to God, I read it in one sitting last night and loved it. I expected it to be a little too cute for my tastes, but the characters are very real, the identity issues totally believable, and the knitting far more compelling than I ever thought it could be. A good blend of different kinds of girls are represented, and the writing is really strong. This is something I'd give to any tweens in my life... a fabulous read!"
5,Chicks with Sticks (Knitwise),"At this time, all the summaries and reviews on this page are from the previous two books. Here is the scoop from the inside cover of the hardback (I haven't finished it so I can't truly review it yet)""For Scottie, Amanda, Bella, and Tay, life in Chicago is about seeking shelter. They've found it in their firelit stitch-n-[...] at Joe; in the halls of their quirky private school; in the arms of boyfriends-and always in the comfort of friendship that bonds them together.But now the Chicks are staring down at the end of high school and it's time to contemplate life beyond the protective web of their knitty ensemble. Will the stresses of college applications and service projects, debutante balls and long-distance loves, mean the end of the Chicks? Or can this unlikely foursome bind-off the happy ending that only true friendship can craft?The end is only the beginning for the Chicks, who return with their trademark wit and warmth along with four fabulous new projects."""
4,Fun Table Lamp,"I really love the look of this table lamp - sort of elegant and sort of quirky. The lamp was easy to assemble. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it was a problem to find replacement bulbs. You won't find them in the grocery store. Found some on-line, and the distributor, after some email correspondence, directed me to a second source. I enjoy the lamp so much that I didn't mind the temporary hassle."
1,Don't read it!!,"The topic seems good: the story of black soldiers fighting bravely during a time of racism, but the story is terribly written. It is full of cliches and weak description. It is very long and filled with event after event, so that you are confused and bored rather than excited and intrigued. It is probably the worst book I have ever read, and I read about a book a week."
1,A high priced DVD-R,"Be aware: this is not a DVD but simply a DVD-R. No remastering (image quality is the same as the old videocassette), no subtitles at all (I'm a little deaf).To be avoided, in my opinion."
2,Black Indians ? should be titled the original natives this hemisphere!,The original people living in this northern Hemisphere were Africans proven by the book written by Dr. David Imhotep entitled The first Americans were Africans!How can a Khazar write about anyone they even lie about who they are Khazars not Hebrews!Hebrews are really wander around the world not get the British to declare a Declaration called the Balfour Declaration as a justification of taken over a land that was already occupied by the rightful and is like the Europeans slaughter the people living in the rename country that labelled America by them and to top it all off put them on reservations that's crazy! You think! Oh yes that's called double standard they live by that!
4,What they don't teach in schools,I first came across this book while visiting FoxWoods. It was the cover and topic that caught my eye.The book was not written to be scholarly work. It was written to tell a part of history that is not taught in schools. I was impressed the author was about to pull together such an amount of information. I would think that there would be very little record written about African Americans and Native Indians nowadays.Overall the book is a good introduction. More work needs to be done to expand this topic / genre.
3,A good touchpad mouse keyboard is hard to find....,"And this one is just ok. My husband and I have been few many of these. It doesn't hold up well to daily use, and the buttons and mouse stick often. There aren't alot of choices, and due to this, I am sure we will keep buying and using this keyboard."
1,"Worked great, then quit","Installation was no problem, and it worked fine until today, when all of the letters on the left side quit working! (I used it about a month, and not a ""hard"" use either)."
5,One of the best bands in my CD collection..,"I was introduced to Circus Maximus at their showcase at ProgPower USA 7 two years ago and became an instant fan... What they do on their CDs - 1st Chapter and Isolate is accomplished live and that is HUGE with me...Both discs are MUST OWNSand side note - some are comparing them to Dream Theater - I personally do not care for DT, they bore me... they try to cram too much into each song... so for me, Circus Maximus is for me what DT is to others... absolute and complete perfection"
5,AWESOME,"I bought Isolate and then it made me buy this, their first one. I was blown by the musicianship in both albums (yes, I did use the word ""albums"" - any questions?). These guys are A_M_A_Z_I_N_G! I haven't heard a band like this in years. To those into Prog Rock I highly recommend this and also if you can get your hands on any of Pagan's Mind albums, do so. You WON'T be dissapointed."
5,This Is one of the Greatest Albums I Ever Heard,"Yes It does have elements of Symphony X and Dream Theater, but it has what Symphony X and Dream Theater to a lesser extent lacks are the powerful and emotional choruses. The guitarist is great (he's no Romeo or Petrucci, but nobody is) and i think the singer is absolutely excelent. This album has the emotion and the talent which I think gives it its own sound."
5,Incredibly beautiful!,"All I wanted was a DVD of the ocean, with natural movement and accompanying ocean sounds. So I started searching, found this production company with Tony Helsloot and Liz Jones, and have been buying their DVD's ever since. They produce absolutely professional and gorgeous video of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Their ocean videos are becoming my favorite gift, especially for those times when you just can't actually get to a beach. Very soothing and relaxing. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying DVD's from these talented professionals!"
1,Ocean Waves DVD by Tony Helsloot,I was amazed that this DVD only lasts 18 minutes. I can`t see awarding this more than one star. Also the 18 minute video simply repeats and there doesn`t seem to be anything else on the disc. In sum I`m very disappointed. I doubt that I`ll be ordering any more Tony Helsloot DVDs..
2,Not as pictured,"See the picture of the HUGE wave? There are zero waves like this in the video. The waves merely lap to the shore. I wanted big huge waves, not laps or trickles."
3,Outdated but informative,"The information inside is a little outdated compared to some of the literature out there. However, it is still a really good resource for the basics of how to rebuild the smallblock and what the process is all about. The pictures are a big help."
5,Every detail covered,A well written and comprehensive book. Everything you need to know plus some.Well worth the money if you want to do it riight!
3,Not bad.... if yer building an older block,"It's not a bad book, but it seems to be written 25 years ago. LOTS of changes since then. That being said, the technology is exactly the same 25 years later so the basics are there. I'm still going thru it so this review may change as I get thru my rebuild.UPDATE: Decided to return the book. I found another more recently written book with lots of pictures. Words do work, but it takes ~1000 to describe what a well taken picture can describe. Sometimes I read and re-read what I just read and then try to make that out from the black and white picture from 1972. No reason in this century to have a black and white picture in a book..."
4,Very good... could use more detail.,"Written from this guys personal experiences. Could use more details/options for the rebuilder and less of his personal gabbing. Otherwise, it's a great book to start with."
2,Not her best book,"I loved reading Ride the Wind and Walk in My Soul and expected this book to be just a good. To me, this was like an afterthought, a book done in a hurry because of a needed paycheck or maybe contract deadline. The first two books I mentioned were so well written, so descriptive that I felt the writer took you right there to experience first hand all that was taking place. I felt this book left a lot of the story out. I have been reluctant to buy another Lucia St Clair Robson book for fear of getting much the same as this one."
4,Lovely album,"Love, love, love, this album every song is well... you have to hear it ""For Lovers Only"" is simply beautiful. ""Frontline"" has a bassline so sharp that it could cut you, and the sexy, tight percussive vocals blow me away! ""Games"" has an almost sentimental whimsical quality that makes the hair stand up on my neck each time I hear it.. Combined with the slick bass, percussion and keyboards, I guess, I'll never grow tired of this song.Also I just can't get over the without compare ""I Should Have Loved You"" It's transcendental I get goose pimples when I listen to it. The harmonies at the beginning the lead vocal the way the music isn't afraid to be sentimental.The ""Nice 'N Wild"" album has a more grown up Chuckii Booker than ""Chuckii"" and it's simply brilliant. I would love to hear what he would do for an encore now that he has achieved the rich patina of age.."
4,Good mystery - well acted.,"I watched this movie with no idea what to expect. For those curious, the gay aspect it minimal. It is part of the plot, but there aren't ""skin"" scenes. The plot is well constructed and Chad Allen is quite convincingly strong as the detective. It's nice to see a detective story where the detective isn't omnipotent. Why 4 stars? Hey, I figured the plot twist out before the final reel. I find this more a murder mystery than a gay murder mystery, but others may thrill at the nudity that's there."
4,More Strachey Please,"The Donald Strachey Mysteries~Third Man Out~Shock to the System~On the Other Hand DeathA Gay Detective? Yes I was a bit apprehensive; however I soon discovered a cleaver story with likable characters, Martinis and an almost Columbo style detective show with a gay edge and Full Frontal Nudity (what more do you need). These Movies were Fun, Intriguing, Heartwarming, Suspenseful and Humorous, with a Showering of Eye Candy and Fabulous Guest Stars. We Want More Strachey Mysteries...it's a fun Friday Night After Work Movie."
4,GOOD MYSTERY,This was a very good mystery. The fact that the lead charater was gay did not take away from the story. Well done mystery with a mater of fact gay charater.
3,Above Average Gay TV Movie,"This movie opens like a senior project in the Film & TV Department at a pretty good college.Fortunately, thanks primarily to very competent acting it improves to the level of an above average TV movie (tho not on Showtime or HBO) with a gay hero. The suspense is pretty good, the plot not especially predictable, and the pacing quite effective.It gets three stars because there's no 2.5 on the scale."
5,this is the second need to see third man out to get soem of it,this is a maivie that fills in some of the things that were left out in the firts movie but helps ou get a better understanign of the characters and see what can be hidden from the inner mind of e veryone
4,I liked it.,"I heard one number on the radio and liked it, so had to get the album. Overall, it is enjoyable. It's rather relaxing, perfect to listen to after a hard day at work or as background music while doing something else at home. It borders on being ethereal, but I can always find the melody line unlike some New Age Jazz. I especially liked Highway Blues. It's rather haunting at first, but is very interesting in its development and comes to a good ending. The bass player has several solos, excellent. Drummer is very good and not overbearing. Piano and sax are equally as good. The players are well balanced between each other."
4,"Good, not great",Most of the long running tracks in this album sound good and entertaining enough. However at the end of listening to it it felt incomplete. And I think it lacks a musical hook or punch to quench our thirst for contemporary jazz music.
2,disappointed,Disappointed after being spoiled by Portal. To bland for me. Wouldn't have bought if I had heard it first.Dan In San Diego
3,Picture Quality,The quality of the picture and sound was dissapointing. I gave it a OK as listening and watching the songs brings back fond memories.
2,Obviously a bootleg,"I have read several of the reviews prior to purchasing this DVD. Did I receive the same DVD?I am an avid Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler fan, and as far as the actual content is concerned, the song selection is decent. The sound is supposed to be Dolby Digital, and it is not. The video is worse. Fuzzy and amateurish production. The DVD came without any literature or other content to describe the event, participants, band, history, etc., etc., etc......I was very disappointed and do not recommend this DVD.Even the cover photo was of a more recent Mark Knopfler."
5,Hands down Greene's best,"I don't know why it took me so long to read ""The Power and the Glory"" (incidentally, for a long time this has been how I remember the last phrase in the Our Father... I used to always put glory before power, but not anymore!).I fell in love with Graham Greene when I was in high school, but I didn't read this book until last year. I finished it in a couple of days of train commuting. All I can say is WOW. Defintely a good one to start on if you haven't read Graham Greene before."
4,"A book about religion, politics and one man's humanity","The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has earned every bit of its reputation as a Modern Classic. The setting of this book is 1930s Mexico in an era when a pseudo communist revolution is taking place and is pushing out the Catholic Church. After a period of time all of the Catholic priests in the area have been rounded up accept for one man who is known simply as the ""Whisky Priest"". This book deals with life, religion, government and poverty; however it is the whiskey priest's struggle with his own humanity and value system that has truly stuck with me since reading it. In a sense it is his humanity which both leads to his destruction and his immortality. I can almost guarantee that he will be one of the most memorable characters you have ever read. With quotes like, ""a poet is the soul of his country..."" How could it not be great??! I am definitely planning on reading more Graham Greene.Recommended"
4,Redemption,"This is one of Greene's ""Catholic"" books, and regarded by some as his best novel. The plot focuses on a Mexican priest, hunted by the law for practicing Catholicism in a state where Catholicism is now prohibited.The priest is a ""whiskey priest"", searching as much for brandy as for God. He's caught in reflection on his own shortcomings as a priest, unworthy even of being hunted down for practicing his religion since he has, in his own evaluation, failed miserably.He has fathered a child and left the child and mother. When he visits the village where they live, the law closes in on him, but the mother of his child protects him and hides his identity, adding to his unworthiness scorecard.(SPOILER ALERT)His ""redemption"" is martyrdom, which of course he doesn't believe he deserves. On the brink of freedom, he returns, knowing that he will be captured, and finally accepts the fate of martyrdom, providing the only tie from his inner unworthiness to the outer martyrdom he will achieve."
2,"Insipid plot, Shallow Characters","I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course. I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later. The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive. Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.I was extremely disappointed.Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly. It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid. The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing. The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico. It sadly shows. He has little understanding of Mexico. I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work. If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven."
2,Steer clear unless you're religious,"Not really worth the read. The text is about a priest on the run in a state trying to stamp out Catholicism. The typical plot about persecution and perseverance then ensues.Throughout it all, the priest charges for confessions and mass, bargaining for his trade. I know this is basically how he makes his living, but it irks me to see him charging for it, even if he lowers the price from 5 pesos to 1 peso because they are poor.In the end, the only redeeming quality of this book is that the priest is a deeply flawed character addicted to alcohol and has a child. The self-moral reality check and eventual progression are good but better told in other stories without being weighted down by religious confliction."
1,I thought this book was unfocused and basically boring.,"This book is terrible for many reasons. One being that it is set in a depressing time and place, and the way Greene depicts his characters, at times, made me sick and I had to put the book down just imagining what they looked like. I really felt depressed while reading this book. It was not uplifting at all. And as Faulkner said in his Nobel Prize Speech 'it is the duty of the writer to uplift the audience and help their spirits soar high.' This book didn't even increase my pulse."
1,I don't want to hear about some priest trying to run away.,Idon't want to hear about some dumb priest trying to run away from the lutinant just because he disobeyed some rules.
4,Glorious human frailty,"Graham Greene probably is one of the most intriguing writers to me. I can't say I like the story itself, but his ability to write such complex matters as sin, martyrdom, frailty, politics, and many more and weave them so coherently with interesting characters is just amazing. Just think of the name whiskey priest! The poetry in his prose and insightful reflections is beautiful as well."
4,The Power & the Glory,"A magnificient story about a priest outlawed during a insurrection in Mexico during the 1930's. The ""whisky priest"", according to other reviews travelled his area in Mexico performing his duties as a Priest. I disagree. He was represented as truly ""human"" man, who happened to be a priest, who could NOT do his duties particularly during trying and difficult times. When it came to escaping the territory and possibly living in a comparativly free (religiously speaking) area he did feel enough responsibilty toward his religion, not to leave. This cost him his life. To me he was a real person, weak and again, very human, ending up with more integrity than he began. Many other interesting characters in this book well worth reading about. Lots of religious discussion here. Graham Greene is a wonderful author."
3,"Read ""The End of the Affair"" first","I discovered Graham Greene on my mother's bookshelf, and he is my new favorite writer. I have decided to read most, if not all, of his work, but I suggest that new Greene readers NOT start with ""The Power and the Glory"" because while it is Greene's writing style at its best, the story itself is not all that interesting or fascinating. I would read this book maybe second or third after ""The End of the Affair,"" which is the best book I have read in five years. Enjoy--"
3,Why all this Christianity?,"It seems like Greene is trying to express his view about what a decent Christian is in this book. In that respect ""The Power and the Glory"" is running the same errand as Dostoyevsky's ""The Idiot"". Anyway both books are quite boring. Judging this book against Greenes own high standard, it's not one of Greenes best books."
3,great but late,Cheapest price I could find and I looked through several sites. The book is in great condition. It took took a long time to get to me. Longer than most other books I ordered at the same time.
5,broader interpretation,"Having read through a number of other reviews here, I think that many people have missed the boat when it comes to their interpretations of Greene's meaning. The character who he focuses on at the end of the story is the cynical young boy, not the priest. Sure, the central character is the priest, but I believe that, by telling his individual story, Greene is really trying to tell the story of an entire lost, desolate people. Throughout the book, there seems no light, only hopelessness in this barren land. On the last page, hope is reborn when the young boy, who's been listening to his mother read about the martyrs only to enjoy the violence to this point, has a change of heart and comes to understand the truth of what these men have been persecuted for."
1,power and glory,"I did not like what i read of the book, and it was a very old book with Extremely Tiny print which made it very hard to Try to read. Perhaps that was why I did not finish."
3,What's the big deal?,"Graham Greene is a fabulous writer. But The Power and The Glory really falls short of being his ""finest"" novel, or even defining him as a writer. The book is good writing, but it lacks much of the moral introspection that Greene's other novels force upon the reader. The priest is a somewhat pathetic character; realistic, but overly predictable. Graham Greene is a MUCH better writer than this book might lead you to believe."
5,Good value for money that kids have fun doing,"I bought one of these for my daughters seventh birthday and she loved it so much that I purchased three more for her cousins for Christmas. She is so proud of her piggy bank and loves ""feeding it"" The only drawback was the brush that was sent with the bank. It is so small that it would have taken a long time to paint, but luckily we had brushes from other paint sets that worked very well."
2,Beatlesque pop.,"When you ask many Adrian Belew fans what their favorite album by him is, quite a few of them will answer ""Inner Revolution"".I have to confess, I'm hard pressed to understand why. The album is full of catchy pop songs, but they're all largely similar, and its this similarity that I find largely unrewarding on the album. Admittedly, there's at least two classics in goofy ""Big Blue Sun"" and the Beatlesque ""Everything"", but with so many songs covering no different ground (""Inner Revolution"", ""The War in the Gulf Between Us""), I can't bring myself to listen to this one much.On the other hand, it is in print, which is more than can be said for most of Belew's catalog, but I'd recommend ""Young Lions"" or ""Here"" before this one."
1,Adrians Musical Therapy,"There seem to be two camps with regard to this album. Those who think this moody introspective album, which is largely the self-theraputic result of Adrian dealing with a rough divorce, is his best work.Then there are those of us that found it to be gloomy and self indulgent. Don't get me wrong! I am a huge fan of Adrian Belew, I have followed his career, seen him on stage and own most if not all his albums, even this one. But I must say, had I access to iTunes or Amazon, back then, and sampled the songs... I would not have purchased this album.My wife used to kid me that I had no ""Happy"" music in my collection, in my effort to show her that was not the case, I pointed to my Adrian Belew collection, from which I could play many a ""Happy"" song. This CD would not fit that mold.It's not a terrible album, but if you like Adrians other work, you should sample this one before purchase."
3,Big button remote helps elder parents,I purchased this to make it easier for my 95 yr old father to watch TV. With some effort I managed to get it to control both the TV and the cable box. It is not a perfect solution but this is more an issue of the difficulty of getting the TV and cable to work together smoothly.
2,Not programmable,"I purchased this remote for my mother in law who is vision impaired and was having a hard time seeing the buttons on the remote that came with the Dish Network system. This 'universal' remote was not compatible with DISH. If you are using Dish Network satellite TV, do not purchase this remote. It will not work."
3,Good but not great,"Surely worth owning, but disappointing compared to their performance of ""El Reloj de Pastora"" released elsewhere, which, if it doesn't actually melt your CDplayer will at least raise the temperature around it. Nothing in this smooth and lively collection has that glasses-fogging intensity."
5,80's baby,"this is for us 80's babies...GREAT show and happy to now have seasons 1-3.I'm still on season two, but can't wait to see 3...many of which I feel I never saw when the show was on air."
5,Love it,"I love these shows, so glad they finally got them all on dvd. I grew up with them and loved them and now my 3 daughters have gotten to know the characters and love the show too."
2,"Dawn, why?","I used to be a huge Dawn Upshaw fan back when she put out her first few recordings. But, now she is one of my very least favorite singers. Why? The excessive nasality, the ridiculous swooping, and the overdone ...mannerisms. On top of that, she has lost the roundness in her upper register (as evidenced by places in Ain't it a Pretty Night). This music doesn't need someone to treat it like a cabaret showtune to be effective, it just needs to be beautifully sung. Once upon a time, I thought Ms. Upshaw was just the person to do this kind of performance...I realize that there are diehard Upshaw fans out there that will completely disagree with me. This is just a warning to those that dislike this sort of approach to singing."
5,En Route To Global Occupation,"Well world, we as sovereign nations are slaves to the Rothschield, Rockafeller etc... Central Bank, that has been calling the loans on the government. Look at the feeling in the air. We are slaves to credit which make the 10 elite very rich"
3,Pseudo academic. No hard evidence. Inflammatory.,"The books of Kah and Still seem to have been well documented. However, one comes to realize that those who hold the same perspective tend to quote one another. Objective coroboration is lacking. If hard academic evidence is what the reader wants, then take a long look at: 'The Fate of the Earth and the Abolition' by Jonathan Schell"
2,rational look at the unrational,"full of interesting information that needs to be known but as with much information of this type, its messenger turns off the main stream (who really needs to hear this stuff)by equating current events to biblical prophesy. like saying ""aliens told me clinton is a socialist"", you may be right about clinton but most likely either insane or dillusional and therefore a dubious source for further information."
4,A Warning That Should Be Heeded!!!,"My mom bought and sent this book to me in the mid-90's. As I would later find out, Gary Kah is a talented public speaker, radio talk personality and author. According to Kah, he has undergone much personal & professional distress because of this book and his beliefs.After first reading this book, I'll admit I was skeptical about his conclusions. Then it occurred to me that (1) that pyramid on the dollar bill is spooky (2) In God We Trust--which god are we talking about here? (3) A global currency would benefit big business interests (4) why would Kah go through so much if this was all bunk?The book is a blistering read and well worth considering whether you believe as he does or not."
2,Recount of the old trilateral commission/masonic conspiracy,"This book is a jumble of guesswork, paranoia, and tired old conspiracy theories mixed with Bible prophecy and . The ""research"" and documentation is weak to laughable and the writing style is not even entertaining.As a believer, I found this work troubling. I don't think our God needs such convoluted and outrageous methods to fulfill His plan for the world. As Mr. Kah himself says in his book ""this plot reads like a James Bond script."" Read it and have a chuckle but go ahead and read a James Bond book if you want Entertaining outrageous fiction"
4,"Good product, good buying experience.","Good product, good buying experience. Great service and on time delivery. Will buy again from this vendor."
2,4th grade level,I chose this book because it was written by an MBA and I was hoping it was going to be more in depth.The book is written for people who are not fluent in English and therefore is at most [...] level. The historical information is sparse. My reccomendation - if you are fluent in English don't bother spending the money - just download the free materials from USCIS. And if you want to learn more about US history just get a history book.PS - I passed the test
5,"Mediteranean, mystical","A great mix of ancient reggae and modern world music. Visions of You is the most classic and best song. A friend of mine I used to surf with turned me on to this, still has that mystical feel surrounding the ocean and is a great listen while traveling to the beach getting amped for a session. Could have been the soundtrack to Gladiator the sounds are so ancient. Get it, enjoy, drink wine in vast amounts. Yyyyyeah! Sheer decadence wrapped in pop philosophy.""Every Man is an Island"" is the backbone of this album. Like I said, you will not regret the purchase if you're up for a trip that takes you away from the mundane."
4,Atlas Wobble and international friends,"Great cast - Wobble, Natacha Atlas, Sinead O'Connor, and The Invaders make for a handful of great tracks with an eclectic world-beat feel."
5,GREAT SOUNDS...,"I have had this cd for about 6 years. I bought it while living in New Zealand. I still love to turn people on to this cd. If you want to hear something different, interesting and just plain great, get this cd."
3,Used book and no CD,"The book was ordered new but I received a used book. I needed a new book which contained the CD in order to complete assignments. However, the used book appears to be in good condition and it arrived sooner then estimated."
4,I know this might sound weird to you...,"Good solid hip-hop. So many people kept saying ""THIS ISN'T DEF JUX, WHAT IS THIS?""...But I liked it. Maybe it's because I've seen 'em live and damn, they get you rowdy. I'm glad to see their doing their own thing. I've been a fan of CT for a while, with Megahertz and even the ""Nighthawks"" CD. This CD was definitely more than I was expecting.Every track is pretty solid. I find myself cranking ""Get Home"", ""Illy"" and ""Last Night"" more than I expected. It's just good, solid, don't give a f*** music."
3,good and funky!,"I liked this.New hip hop.It is not as good as Mary K. Blige, but she is a talented artist nonethless."
5,Very informative product!,"""Super fast delievery! Very informative and educational product with a personal touch as well. Fun, interesting facts and other tidbits about Carol Kaye are included with tutorial book (personally autographed too!!), dvd, and cd!! These resources will be used over and over. Thanks for a great product! """
3,"Good, but!","Any musician will agree the content that Carol Kaye offers is excellent. However, the presentation is very dated. I would suggest the material be made available for the Ipad and other more current media than the DVD."
3,Good Watch,"This is a very good watch, a little bit heavy and bulkier than I thought it would be. Works fine so far. Doesn't say what is warranted."
4,Mr.Underrated,"Another unknown who's got more chops and creativity than most of the 'names' on the scene. Mr. Nordal has done faithful recreations ( note-for-note and stylistic) as well as his own tunes and improvisations here. I can't wait to hear the next one! My only question: If he's dedicating the tune to Keith Jarrett, why does he quote Corea's 'the Woods' in the middle of his 'improv?' I loved it anyway!My only complaint - I'd love to see more of his own tunes. When you're that good at 're-creating', it's time to focus more on 'creating.' One of his strengths is composing, he should exploit it. If you like Jazz piano, GET THIS CD!!"
5,Dexter Men's Slash Bowling Shoes,This is a great pair of bowling shoes at a good price. I have bowled two to four times a week in league and practice for over two years and they are very comfortable and remain in top condition.
1,"just not hot enough, and what's with the alarming warning??",This just doesn't heat hot enough. There is no discernible difference in the heat settings. Sometimes it feels like it has turned itself off even if the indicator light is on high. But what I really didn't like is a tag on the cord indicating it contains lead and that I should wash my hands after use!! What is that about?? Who wants to jump out of bed to wash their hands after this thing has supposedly eased their cramps (or other aches & pains) before sleep?? Does this mean all my appliance cords contain lead?? I will be forever washing my hands! How about just not putting lead in the cord??
2,Product quit working in 4 months,"While this is a great shape and design, I found it to be the most unreliable of the heating pads I've purchased in the last several years.It started by heating irregularly about a month before it quit. Then one night after being turned off, it just wouldn't turn back on. This may just be a fluke, but I wouldn't order this pad again."
5,Nice heating pad at a great price!,I bought this heating pad because of it's shape. I have back problems and it fits just right around my lower back! What's great too is I can just throw it in the washing machine and dyer!
1,Never Worked (longer than 5 minutes),"I ordered this item for my Aunt who is going through Chemo. Not the point though, just found out from her this week that it has never properly worked. She will plug it in and within 5 minutes the auto turn off is flashing and turning off, at that point the pad must be unplugged and let set for 5-10 minutes before plugging back in. Would not recommend this to anyone and would return if I had found out sooner."
1,Broke after 2 hours,"I think this is the first time I've reviewed an item on Amazon. I bought this heating pad and it worked for the first 2 hours but it never really got hot. After about 2 hours a red light started blinking on the controller. I unplugged the pad and plugged it back in, the light still blinks and the pad won't warm up. I read the directions wondering if this was some sort of bizarre auto-off function but it's not. The product is busted so i'm off to return it. Luckily Amazon will pay the return shipping since the product is defective.It says ""MADE IN CHINA"" so the quality control is most likely poor. Half the pads probably work well; I just happened to receive a lemon."
1,"TRENDY? AS TRENDY AS THEY GO, MY FRIENDS","IF YOU LIKE TRENDY, YOULL LOVE THIS! HEY I AM CIV, THE SINGER! AND I SOLD MY SOUL TO MTV WHEN I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE TRENDY, AND I WANTED PEOPLE TO LIKE ME, BECAUSE I FELT SO LONLEY, AND MY GIRLFREIND ALWAYS WANTED ME TO BUY HER STUFF SO I REALLY NEEDED THE EXTRA MONEY. SO PLEASE FELLOW TREND SEEKERS BUY MY CD. TODAY! ITS SO GOOD, WHAT I HAVE DONE IS SLOWED IT DOWN TO FIT YOUR LISTENING NEEDS. MTV IS GREAT! I LOVE IT. GO WATCH IT TODAY. YOU DONT WANT TO MISS OUT ON ANY NEW TRENDS! I HOPE TO BE AS COOL AS MARIAH CARRIE ONE DAY! BECAUSE I SOLD MY SOUL TO TV STATION! FRIENDS, FOLLOW ME, ON A MAGIC JOURNEY TO TRENDY LAND AND MAY WE ALL BE ENLIGHTENED BY ONE ANOTHERS TRENDYNESS, BE SURE TO LET ME KNOW WHAT BAND IS GOING TO BE COOL NEXT! I WOULDNT WANT TO MISS OUT! BESIDES IVE GOT TO KEEP UP WITH THE TRENDS TO! AFTER ALL I DONT MAKE THEM. I JUST SELL MY SOUL TO THEM!"
2,another good punk band sells their music to MTV,"I first listened to Civ when he was the lead singer of the hardcore band Gorilla Biscuts. They were arguably one of the best hardcore bands ever. Then CIV formed. The first album ""Set your goals,"" though toned down, was a great album. With inspirational lyrics reminiscent of his hardcore days. I started to become concerned when they put a video on MTV. My fears were heightened when I heard they became a house band for some stupid MTV spring break show. This is not to say that a band playing on MTV is a sellout. But in most cases the you'll find their music changes to accomodate the pop MTV crowd. This the path that CIV took. The music can best be described as pop punk. With easy listening guitar riffs and a new melodic, light hearted singing voice (and lyrics) to go with it. Try their debut album if you like good punk music"
2,Average at best,"If you, like me, stumbled upon this album because you enjoyed ""Set Your Goals"" and were looking for more CIV, don't bother with this one. Although CIV really is the definition of a one-hit wonder (""Can't Wait One Minute More""), the whole ""Set Your Goals"" album was surprisingly good, it was a great mix of Punk, Ska, and Hardcore rolled into one. They really laid an egg with ""Thirteen Day Getaway"" though. The first few tracks are pretty good, but the album goes down hill quick. It is not bad enough for 1 star, because it is at least listenable, and I reserve that rating only for that which is unlistenable...2 stars is an adequate rating. FYI, my copy is now sitting at the local CD exchage store because it just wasn't good enough for me to bother pulling out and listening to for only two or three songs once in a great while. It is probably in their ""3 for $5"" bin."
4,Civ has a cool sound,"This CD will definately get stuck in your head. It's catchy tune and lyrics will have you listening to each song over and over, but it's a little too ""hard core"" and some of the songs just suck. (Check out #2-- it's the best one!)"
5,Great album,"This CD is just as rocking as the first one, but is a bit more musical. It's an excellent punk album, so buy it today."
4,"Disappointed, but optimistic","Ok so I've known about the YYY's for a while but this is the first stuff I have heard of them besides ""Maps"" and ""Zero."" All together an album worth listening to. Some of the better rock sound I've heard in years, but one very annoying thing is that Karen O repeats words over and over again in about every song. I picked it up immediately, so it kind of annoys now when I listen to it. She is a good singer, but needs to fill gaps in the song with more lyrics, less repetition. I can say that this record has really intrigued me enough that I am going to buy their latest release ""its Blitz"" right now. Conclusively a refreshing ray of hope in the dying world of alt rock."
4,in love,"i have been listening to this cd, more specifically the last track and the bonus hidden track, on repeat for the last 3 days straight since i purchased the cd. the last song (modern romance) and the hidden track are just godly. the rest of the cd is good as well but these tracks just really put it over the edge. these are more mellow and calm while the rest of the cd can get a little screechy at times. but all in all it is an amazing cd...for your own sake, buy it now!"
5,"I have to say ""YEAH"" to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs","This album is awesome. I love the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Karen O's voice is haunting and what a girl's voice should sound like. Nick Zinner does miracles to the guitar & Lets not leave out Brian Chase keeping an awesome beat. IF your into indie-garage-punky sort of stuff this is a good band. Get ready to be playing air guitar and tapping your feet to this 11 track 37 minutes album.!.!-enjoi--jordan-"
2,Too Hyped,"Two words - downright tedious. Don't waste your time unless you're into being tortured for 37 minutes. The album lacks direction and coherence. To hear true female talent ahead of her time, pick up an old Siouxsie & the Banshees album instead. Karen O' just doesn't have it."
3,A Good Cartoon,"There's a lot of spot-the-influence going on with this NY trio, specifically lead singer Karen O - she's often compared to Courtney Love and PJ Harvey. I'd like to make a less highfaluting suggestion: Gwen Stefani. On Fever to Tell, Yeah Yeah Yeahs are basically the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion fronted by Orange County's quirkiest warbler. Which is to say that O's a punk cartoon surrounded by music created with the help of a user's manual. This is both a dig and a compliment. Some cartoons rock (""South Park""), some make you think (""The Simpsons""), and some just make you laugh out loud (""SpongeBob Squarepants""). Yeah Yeah Yeahs do all three, often over the course of the same song (""Rich"", ""Black Tongue""). Every now and then they're all too human - you can hear the blood coursing through Karen O's veins on ""Maps"", a Gothic love song to her Goth boyfriend from Interpol. They're already better than No Doubt. If she's lucky, she may turn her band into the new millenium's answer to Blondie."
4,It's great,"This CD is great, not super duper awesome but I really like it and I know I'll be listening to it for a long time. I'm really happy my friend Alina got me into this band a few months ago. Karen O is the best female vocalist in music right now so if you want a strong female rocker, buy this album."
4,it's only rock'n'roll,"This is rock'n'roll music, in my opinion, of the very good kind. When I listen to this kind of music, I'm looking for some kind of energy, hopefully lots of it and on that front, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs most definitely deliver. I can't wait to see them live, I've heard it's better than the recorded stuff.Yes, it's simple, in skill, arrangement, whatever. And it's loud, screeching, vulgar (not all of it though). If you're put off by that then you're barking up the wrong tree, I don't know why you thought you'd like it in the first place."
1,Only 2 standout tracks,"Only 2 standout tracks - the 2 awesome ones that got radio airplay. Why haven't any more singles been released... because the rest of the album is WEAK! If the whole album was like the 2 singles, 5 stars for sure. Only 2 good tracks... well, don't say I didn't worn ya."
2,"They may be great live, but ---","This is not a very good CD. I bought it after reading a couple of reviews, and hey, the price is attractive. The CD is a disappointment. The band sounds kind of like an unmusical Iggy & the Stooges. There's a lot of sonic sludge over the course of the disc. I didn't find anything I even halfway liked until track # 9, which is a little Pretenders-ish. I spent less than half of the cost of a regular CD, but even then I felt like I wasted my money. Two other comments: (1) It IS amusing that a band called the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have a song called ""No No No."" (Even if the song is less than great.) (2) I'm willing to forgive a bad CD cover if the music is good (like with The Coral), but this CD is bad, and geez, that's one awful CD cover!"
2,"The music's ok, but the lyrics suck","my sister bought this cd and plays in the car almost everyday. it gets old very fast. the yeah yeah yeahs could be good if they tried, but it doesnt look like there was any effort. in almost every song, it seems like they run out of ideas for lyrics and start saying the same damn word over and over. In the song Date with the Night, they say the word ""chow"" literally 10 times in a row and the song Pin is even worse because they say ""bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom/ de dun de dun de dun de dun"" 4 times in a row as the chorus. it was sooo annoying! even though they're punk, hiring a songwriter could really do them some good."
1,Best Album for the Deaf in Years!,"Pack upI've strayedEnoughOh, say say sayWait, they don't love you like i love youWait, they don't love you like i love youMa-a-a-a-ps, wait!They don't love you like i love youPack upDon't strayOh, say say sayOh, say say say...When this is our idea of a ""well-developed song,"" Armageddon cannot be far behind. It's incredible how we elevate monosyllabic morons with bad chop-job haircuts to the status of ""artists."""
1,ugh,"karen o is a vapid, image-obsessed hipster with no talent. she doesn't care about music, she just craves fame. this cd basically just sounds like every other electrotrash cd ever released. nothing authentic, genuine, or different.personally i'd rather listen to public bathroom recordings than this."
1,I miss refunds in music stores,"Fads are lots and lots of fun, aren't they? Well they must be, I mean you surely are here.Do yourself a favour and buy ""Metric - Old World Underground, Where Are You Now?"" instead. It is music you are looking for right?1 star = Maps"
2,"ahhh, ahhh, ahhh","I liked about three songs on this cd, mostly because I am not fond of the yips, screams, and moans that come out of this woman. Also, I had no idea how sexual this album was and I popped it in while my little girls were in the car and immediatly popped it back out. It may grow on me, but I just don't know if I can get over the excess noises that come from the lead singer."
2,Good grief,"I'm getting older, that's true, so my musical tastes are changing. But my ears work just fine and this style is just plain odd. I can't even find any redeeming qualities to talk about so I'll leave it at that. Maybe the live show is what sells their sound..."
1,"The lead ""singer"" is hot!","About three years ago, the wanna-be urbanite hipster squad decided that they needed to ""save"" rock'n'roll. They had NO IDEA what rock'n'roll was but, darn it, they had to save it. Well the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are the latest and not-so-greatest band in a long line of trendy bandwagon jumpers to attempt to revive the already healthy and vibrant rock'n'roll scene. You see, had the Yeah Yeah Yeahs EVEN PAID ONE BIT OF ATTENTION OR EVEN REALLY LISTENED TO ROCK'N'ROLL they would have realized that rock'n'roll HAS been kept alive and strong. The Devil Dogs, Raunch Hands, Dictators, Ramones and many TRULY GREAT bands kept rock'n'roll alive while the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were busy combing their hair and trying to figure out if Duran Duran were cooler than Ah-Ha! So, don't be fooled by hype and cool haircuts! The Yeah Yeah Yeahs will end up in the delete bin right next to all the so-called ""Garage"" bands of the last couple of years!"
5,Fun energetic debut,"I was a bit hesitant about investigating YYY, but for once the trashy tabloids like NME heap their praise on a deserving band. Not to say that ""Fever to Tell"" is perfect, but it's a damn compelling mish-mash of new wave, blues-tinged punk and noisy pop. And then there's Karen O. I guess your enjoyment of the album may depend a lot on just how much of her squealing, screeching, howling, wailing, warbling, yelping, moaning, etc. you can take in a long run. Personally I find her a hugely entertaining vocalist, who sounds even better once she tones down her rock star persona on songs like ""Maps"" and ""Modern Romance"", which display a more soulful, sensitive side to her singing. It's mostly for the presence of these last four mature songs that I look forward to what YYY will do next."
4,OH YEAH!!!!,"This is an interesting CD. If you're a fan of the punk genre or are just looking for a new sound -- BUY THIS CD.The female vocalist has a really intriguing presentation. She growls, howls -- and carries a tune. Some of the songs are very catchy (my favorites are trak 1, maps and y control).The best aspect of this band is the female singer. She is different (to say the least) and she carries it off so well. I never get tired of her vocals. I'm always interested in female singers that can actually sing and that have a strong presentation and she excels in those areas (in my opinion).If you like strong female vocalists and engaging punk rock, this CD won't disappoint."
3,EHHH. I PAID A HARD HEARNED $10 FOR IT,y control and maps and the final song were the stand outs. everything else was a little too tough to accept. its a decent cd but if i were you'd i'd just borrow it from a friend or download the last 3 tracks.
4,a wild ride.,"this is straight-up, pared-down rock and roll. there's so much hate and beauty and lust and violence behind karen o's voice; much as there's a lot of hate and beauty and lust and violence in the album. raw. good."
2,Fever to Tell,"After hearing their EP I was looking foward to the full legnth album release. Expectation always sets you up for a fall and this isn't an exception. If it weren't for the hype maybe I would feel more kindly towards this CD, but I wouldn't have aquired it. Many of the songs seem kind of repetitive. KAren O has a good and distinct voice, but all the Coo'ing and moaning seemed to be a substitute for good lyrics.There are good songs on the album but getting to them is a challenge. I found myself tunning out the music while I was listening. (something that usually only happens with CD's I've heard to many times). It makes it hard to appreciate the songs on the album that are good.I won't discaurage people from purchasing this album. THey may find merit in it that I didn't. And when I am in a specific mood the atmosphere that the songs create can be appropriate. But if I listen to the songs to closely rather than as atmosphere the enjoyment decreases a bit."
3,"Incredible singer, boring songs","I bought this CD based on the hype generated about this band by Rolling Stone and the foreign press, as well as some write-ups by various music critics. Karen O lives up to the hype, the rest of the Yeah Yeah Yeah's act frankly does not. Other than the MTV hit ""Maps"", the songs are a bit musically uninteresting. (Hint guys: get a bass player!) Karen O screams, shouts, purrs, and hoots up a storm, and shows how fine of a vocalist she is in the process. I wanted to like this album more than I did-- Karen gets 2 stars, the rest of the band gets 1 for a total of 3 stars. Now, back to you, Ed...."
3,fever to tell,"many people have written reviews, so mine won't make much difference. but i have to point out one thing most people seem to miss. her singing on this album - mainly ""maps"" sounds sooo much like Siouxsie of Siouxsie and the Banshees. if you want to hear a real original ""punk/alternative"" female singer. just go pick up the singles collection volume one from siouxsie and the banshees. late 70's into 1983. its the best out there and still holds up better than just about any cd to ever come after it. yeah yeah yeahs is good, but really just a rip off of the original siouxsie"
5,"this is just great music, folks.","i was recently burned a copy of this cd by a friend, and immediately after hearing the album once, i rushed out to my nearest music store to purchase ""fever to tell"".this is probably the most addicting cd i've come across in a long time. each song has a different hook, that just grabs you as soon as you listen. karen o's sexy wailings are just absolutely perfect for this band. her voice ranges from grinding in your ears, to a beautiful melodic capture. in the bonus track, ""porcelain"", she says the lyrics ""don't be afraid of love"", and it's the most beautiful track on the album. every single track holds its own on this cd. you can bet that after i heard enough on this cd, i ran and also bought the 2 EP's. great music. enough said."
2,meh,"some of the songs are decent, but they deffinatly dont make this cd a worthwhile buy. i also dont understand all the magazines and journalists that think that karen o is so cool, because shes just so mediocre it kills me. spin gave her (...) goddess of the year? no, i dont think so guys. basically this band is a cheap rip off of some truly good bands, and its a shame that they are getting so much hype for it."
4,Got a Fever for Yeah Yeah Yeahs,"This new band is just exploding with energy and it is easily seen through Karen O.'s (lead singer) intense vocals and the incredibly talented bass player's riffs. Although this band is only 3 people and always leaves me wanting a guitar line, the minimalist drumming style along with the bold bass and vocals really create a powerful trio."
2,I am tired of hearing about this band,"Seriously, what's with the whole garage rock revival hype machine thing? These guys were ""the next big thing"" before they had even recorded more than 15 minutes of music. And those two previous releases weren't full lengths, unless you consider a 7-minute EP worth paying 15 bucks for. I mean this band doesn't suck, but they're not that great either. The only song that really stands out is ""Maps"". Anyway, don't buy this, buy something better."
4,The Great Right Hype,"Introduced through the influx of a massive amount of hype, second to none other than that received by ""King"" James, the Yeah Yeah Yeah's were practically destined to fail. However with a talent that goes beyond mentioning guitarist Nick Zinner, drummer Brian Chase, and singer Karen O masterfully live up to and may possibly exceed that which has been named as hype. No massed produced trite riffs, chords, or lyrics here. This is pure garage brand rock. Indubitably, Karen O is a shining star - no matter who you are - and fronts a band with powerful, compelling Chase/Zinner instrumental play that brings this band to consummation. From forceful songs such as ""Cold Light"" to the melodic songs such as ""Maps,"" Fever to Tell offers a decent range of musicianship worth the attention of any rock fan."
3,It's fine but overrated.,"This band is okay but all of the hype is completely overblown. The music sounds like so many others out their that when the trend dies out--the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs will be gone, gone, gone.If you like this kind of music, it will be enjoyable but it won't change your life as all this incessant hype makes it seem."
4,Are you kidding me?,"How can anyone NOT like this. Perfect, no. Interesting, definitely yes, and considering that rock has been around for 60 years, interesting is the best compliment you can give to a band. In a continuing age of endless recycled Eddie Vedder growls and pathetic made for MTV pandering, music like this is a refuge. This is a record for listeners."
2,You've Heard It Before,"I too was suckered into FEVER TO TELL by some oh-so-hip pre-release reviews, and I am dissapointed with the record.The band plays everything through a muddy echo chamber and sounds like nothing so much as Romeo Void without the saxophone, the sense of humor, or any semblance of a melody.I've heard this record--or at least a lot of records that it imitates--a million times before, and it was dull then too."
2,Not convinced,"This sounds like Kelly Osborne rented fugazi for a studio album, but didn't tune to any of their power. Moments like Mars gave it a couple of stars but the angst is all a put on. Switch on to the whole Concrete Blonde collection if you want to hear a lady rock."
1,Yeah Yeah Yeah... please turn this crap off!,"Okay, first off, let me say that I don't like to say that bands are awful, because everyone has their own tastes and opinions, but sometimes, someone so bad comes along that to have to speak up. I don't normally write online reviews, but I felt I had an obligation for this one. Before I say anything negative, let me also start off by saying, I really like the actual music itself. It sounds good and I enjoy it. But one thing kills it: Karen O. Her voice is just so absolutely bad. She shouts and makes the most ridiculous noises ever. I can't remember the name, but in one song she sounds like the little engine that couldn't, trying to chug her way over a hill, and failing miserably. It's just bad. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, considering it's sorely lacking in good vocals... I take that back... Her voice RUINS the CD. She's just SO AWFUL! *Ahem* Anyway, don't but this album, don't even burn it. Just break it into pieces, PLEASE!"
3,The milkshake of doom and destruction,"Once in a while an album comes along the creates its own milkshake of deception. This is not that album. Do the trees agree? I think we all know the answer to that question. Or maybe only Jesus Christ knows. He was the original milkshake of deception. But Ghandi was too, and he wasn't all the bad. This begs the question, how do Karen O and Ghandi both manage to grind their sausage so well? I'll leave you with that bit of wisdom, or should I say, ghisdom? And so it was."
1,No No No,"Bland, predictable, unexciting, feeble, totally non-creative, lackluster, uninventive - these are all adjetives I would use for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs sound like the Pretenders minus any sort of talent."
1,Terrible,"This CD is in one word: Vapid. Songs don't go anywhere, no big surprise seeing there's no bass player, and the guitar is too repetitive to support such an approach. Drummer simply can't play. Bands like the Gories and the White Stripes can get by on this formula, but not this band. Can't even tell where this band is coming from. Are they this bad on purpose? No discernible talent except the singer's voice is cool. I turned this off after the 3rd song and never looked back. Worst CD I have ever bought. Was tempted to just throw it away. The next day I e-mailed everyone I knew and told them not to buy this. Paid off too because my one friend said he was going out that day to get it. At least I was able to save someone ELSE some cash. I am Pi**ed and want my money back! Definitely a product of the hype machine."
2,Another White Stripes Wannabe,"This band is just another White Stripes wannabe that has sprung up in the recent years. Karen O or whatever her name is can't sing for toffee, and the musicians can't play that well, either. A Date With The Night is a cool song, but that's about it. Get something original, go buy Elephant by the WS instead."
4,Enticing,"Just from hearing Karen O sing one sentence lets you know she has one of the most distinct voices music has ever had. She can pant, pout and do a bunch of stuff these stiff singers nowadays could never dream of. The songs contain some of the best sounds I've heard since I got into the Pixies. Even the two that I think could have changed a little(No No No and Maps) have sounds that will make you have faith in great music. Whether its the frenzic guitar parts, pounding drums, or Karens blistering vocals, this album will blow you away."
3,Give Me Fever,"At times, sounding more like ""Stories From the City Stories from the Sea,"" and at others more like music from ""Pretty on the Inside,"" it's a mix that just didn't captivate me. Lyrically, the band is not exceptional, yet they do seem to ""have a way"" with at least ""some"" words. Their hard-core rock persona is cast off with the last three tracks, and track 9 (of 11), ""Maps,"" (perhaps one of the few redeeming qualities of the album), is the best song on the record far and away, albeit not representative of the rest of the record. Overall, the record seems slightly rushed and underdeveloped. The incessant yelling/complaining of Karen O gets a little annoying by track 6 and has long before started to seem a little ""faux."" Still, forced or not, it is a tolerable first go at a full album. The Vines told us rock was back, (or was that Rolling Stone?), and considering, I think I'd rather wait `til the Yeah Yeah Yeah`s have matured a little more musically before they join that revival."
5,this disc kicked me in the eye,"and I loved it. Everytime I even play this disc, I feel special, because they allow me to purchase the disc and listen it to it. There is only one disclaimer I have for those who bought this disc solely on the strength of Maps... you're in over your head. From Rich to Modern romance, the set is dark and mysterous, yet artistic, balanced, and organic. Although they're on a major label, they stuck with the sound of their two previous EPs. Nick Zinner and his experimental guitar, inspired me to get the lead out of my ass and learn how to play my guitar, and Brian Chase with his jazzy drumming gave me a different perspective on what punk is. There is more to punk than Green Day (don't get me wrong... they kick ass), there is room for art and refinement while still be true to the politics of Punk. Karen is the coolest cauc-asian ever. She just came in on Date with the Night and just killed this disc, put it right into the perfection arena."
5,I'm so behind........,"Just picked up the album this weekend. OHMIGOD, it kicks A##~! I love this band! That is the best feeling, discovering a new band and liking the entire album. In today's world of crap music, the YYYs stand out and shine! When does the next album come out.from, A Le Tigre fan"
2,dissapointing,"I was looking for some CDs. And I came upon this one. I heard their song maps, and I liked it. When I finnaly bought it and startes listening to it, I was dissapointed. All of the songs seemed to be exactly the same, and from song number 1 to song number 7.I thought it was stilll the same song! They are so incredible alike.. all of the songs have screaming, yelling, chriping, smashing and even orgasm that It's just annoying mess. I still like yeah yeah yeahs a lot, i was just diaapoindent by this particular album of theirs. Hope they do better next time..."
5,wild and rebellious!,"i love every minute of it. very energizing and rebellious! This is a cd for people who enjoy a loud screechy female vocalist who wails in almost sexual ways. Karen O. truely is a master vocalist, and she conjures sounds that i had no idea humans could make. From screams to moans, squeaks, hiccups, and whines Karen O. carries you on a wild ride that i have yet to find another like it. maps, the most known song on the cd, could almost be discribed as a fluke because although it is probably the best track on the cd it quite different from the rest of FTT. liking maps does not insure that you will like the rest of this album, however it is very possible to like the robust loud tracks of FTT and still groove with maps and y control. my only complaint is that FTT is only 37min! however dynamite comes and small packages, so definitely give this album a listen!"
4,"dude, this is awesome","i can't get enough. AND...i have had the album for a while now and i'm still not remotely sick of it. i mean, i don't listen to it everyday but i must say, karen o. ROCKS. woman to woman, she makes me proud."
3,A lot of pretentious noise....,"... that relies too heavily on the unique vocals of the singer. Still it's worth buying ($9.99-$10.99 at most places) for ""Maps"" and ""Y Control"". ""Rich"" and ""Modern Romance"" are pretty good too, the rest of the album is good only for annoying your neighbors, roommates, co-workers, passengers, etc."
3,I only bought it for MAPS,"I bought it for the song Maps. I love that song, however there are only maybe two or three other good songs. If you've got itunes just buy Maps. The cd isn't worth it."
2,Not impressive.,"The Yeah Yeah Yeahs don't impress me. I bought this cd because it was cheap, and I thought it would sound like the D4 but with a female lead singer. Well, the lyrics arent nearly as good as the D4s, and I wouldent really say the D4s had the best lyrics in the world. It seemes like anyone could've wrote this album, and some of it is irritating, especially when the lead singer says noises like 'tick' and 'chop' a bunch of times in a row. Musically, the band doesent show that great of musicmanship. The bass and guitars, as well as the drumming, arent anything special. I have heard it plenty of times, but much better. This band has alot of energy though, but I dont really like listening to this cd that much. I dont really like a whole lot about it. If you consider this punk, theres much better punk avaible, like the Distillers, Rancid, among many others. Take caution buying this."
2,I wanted to like it...,"Well, the BEST thing I can say is that it's not your generic garage rock of late, but it DOES have the annoying and pretentious parts of the genre and Nina Hagen. Since when did Lo-Fi become ""sloppy"" and not very well thought out or written? I saw them live and they were terrible. A friend convinced me that the singer siad it was one of their worst shows ever, so I decided to give them another chance. Call me crazy, but I kinda like singers that can sing, adn songs that I can remember."
2,No No No,"Chuck D. was right: Don't believe the hype.Great playing but, Karen O's singing is annoying; she sounds like PJ Harvey's young, dumb sister for most of the CD... BUT, on the last 3 songs and the hidden track she finds her own voice. And it's great to hear. I wish she had sustained that quality for the first 8 songs. This could've been a classic album, maybe next time..."
4,"If you don't like it, don't review it!","Please don't compare this (or anything) to Pretenders I, since that album is one of the best in rock history. This however has a sound of it's own. Sure you can say Karen screams or whatever, she's not perfect (and what exactly is it that Bjork is doing?) If you haven't seen them live, then you have no business reviewing them. Nick Zinner does a pretty good job on guitar too. And for those you think otherwise, listen to their follow-up ""Show Your Bones"". Again, the haters are just jealous struggling 30-something ""musicians"" (more like scenesters) who are living off Top Ramen and Mac n' Cheese, just waiting for someone to discover them on MySpace. Give it up already."
1,"Please, If I wanted to listen to crap I would put in Nirvana","Horrible Band, no talent at all. Same medolic songs same guitar cords same everything ICK."
1,Worst fake punk since PINK!,"I havent seen the punk image be so smoothed out and catered for mtv2 and rollingstone like this since Pink started doing it.If you think Pink and Christina Aguilera have a hard-edge side, youll love this. If you enjoy honest sincere rock music, you'll be insulted by the stupidity and pretension this album offers too much of."
1,"Yeah Yeah Yeah, Go Away!","I wish I could give this crap negative 5 stars, but Amazon won't let me. I hate this group with a passion. Their song ""Maps"" that has been on MTV lately makes me want to cut my ears out and flush them down the toilet. Don't support bad groups and bad music, and they won't stay around and make music, they will just disappear like other bad bands like Vertical Horizon. Oh, and a side note, don't support The White Stripes, a band that the Yeah Yeah Yeahs is compared to, either. They aren't as bad as the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, but they come close. Both these bands just need to go away."
1,Just...Don't buy it.,"It...just...burns. Karen O screaming so much?! SCREAMING ISN'T MUSIC! I can scream. But I don't sell music. She like when you're choking and you're screaming at the same time. She sounds like she's hoarse. My mouth just popped open after listening to one song of the album at my friend's house. The singing girl sounds like SHE'S DYING. This is not good music... I don't know what she's trying to do or say during ""Man"". And all those pointless noises in the other songs. -999999999999999 STARS."
3,Island living during the depression,"There was really not much to this book -- a kind of brief, short read. An interesting insight into Island living during the depression years."
1,"Very, Very Disappointed With This Supplier. I want my money back!!",I ordered the Pro Grip PG Tank Protector Carbon-55005CA from Powersport Superstore.In one area of the product description it lists the product as being 11 X 7 inches. When the product arrived the product was actually closer to 8 1/2 by 6 inches. The packaging size was 11 X 7 inches!!In another fine print area the product was described as 29.9cm X 17.8 cm. When I measured the product is was closer to 22 X 15 cm. So even that info was incorrect.The shipping was also 3 days later than promised.I am going to ask for a return of my money on this order. I wouldn't order from this company again.
4,Wynonna - A classic Christmas,Beautifully arranged. Her Ave Maria is quite impressive. Her talent far exceeds her country music roots. Too bad she wasn't classically trained.
5,Musical sweetness to your ears!,Right outta the cd holder and into the cd player...Wynonna started with a wonderful song and the cd just continued with a great flow...and rythm...the song selections were great....her voice is just magical!
4,Very Good Holiday Album,"Good Holiday entertainment if you enjoy Wynona. I did think it would be more lively, though."
5,love it,"I have always loved Wyonna, I love Christmas music, so put them together and I had a very merry christmas.You could tell Wyonna loves christmas music too."
5,A Beautiful Christmas,"I am so glad that I purchased the Wynonna, Classic Christmas CD. It was the most beautiful Christmas present. The voice on Wynonna is just beautiful and it made a very festive holiday even better.Thank you Wynonna."
5,JUST ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS CD,Anything more beautiful is Il Divo. Wynonna did a wonderful job with this CD. It is one of my favorites.
5,Superb,"Wynona shines on this superb Christmas album. I have never "" felt "" the emotions on these classics like Wy made me feel. She has to be one of the best female vocalists, whether she is singing country, Judd's music, or as in this album, from her soul! Her voice is like an instrument and she surely knows how to play it. This has to be one of, if not my favorite Christmas album! Thank you for giving us this gift, Wynona and for her fans and for those who aren't, give yourself a present this year and buy "" A Classic Christmas - you won't be sorry!"
1,How disappointing!,"I'm a big fan of Wynonna's and was totally disappointed with her Christmas album. On many of the songs, it was hard to recognize who was singing. I missed her distinctive stylings and voice!"
1,Pass on this one,"One of the other reviewers asked if there is anything Wynonna can't sing. I recommend listening to albums before reviewing them; this album answers that question. It is obvious that her talent does not extend beyond country.I was listening to station that played her version of Ave Maria. It was atrocious. I listened to the rest of the album to see if maybe she had just tried to over reach on that piece. Unfortunately, it was not just that song. The entire album is a Christmas spirit killer."
5,Amazing!!,This by far is one of the best Christmas CDs to be released in a long time. Wynonna's voice just takes you back to childhood Christmas memories. This is definately a cd that will be given out as gifts.
2,where's Wynonna?,"I totally agree with the person who said this cd lacks ""spark""...it sounds as if Wynonna did this to fulfill some sort of job contract, she lacked any of the heart and soul we've come to love. What a disappointment."
3,Unremarkable,"Bought this for Ave Maria but was disappointed with that song and the rest. Seemed a bit off key and the other songs were less than wonderful. I excitedly opened it with my adult daughter and we were both ""underwhelmed.""Still a Wynonna fan."
4,A Classic Christmas,"Wynonna Judd is a very gifted singer, and she has proved to be able to sing both country and rock, and now she shows she can sing Christmas classics as well.""A Classic Christmas"" contains a good collection of Christmas classics. Her voice is perfect, and the musical arrangements are beautiful. The album has a very good christmas feeling. And her version of ""O Holy Night"" is very beautiful (and I don't usually listen to religious music).If you're going to buy only one christmas album, this might be the one to buy."
5,Blues perfection?,"One of the great blues albums of all time;past or present,black or white. If you can't find a place in your head for this album, I would suggest moving on to some other musical genre. Classic."
5,The best cd I have,"This is the most expresive music I have find, I love to search for authentic music that comes from the roots of world cultures and features a respectful, clean, modern production. If you hate syntetizers and love to feel in your skin the vibration of arabic - african percussion, spanish acoustic strings and raw deeply engaged vocals, you will love it. Es como si un grupo de musicos milagrosamente hubiera logrado entender en que punto los mejores ingredientes de las culturas ancestrales que habitaron españa, podian combinarse para producir una musica extremadamente poderosa,llena de fuerza, vida, rabia, alegria y expresion."
3,several good songs,one reviewer likes the Rumba...cd better. i agree--the sound of the man's voice is a bit harsh this time. i wonder if its the same man. there are a few good songs on temporal. i like cancion sefardi....and i like tangos de la condicion and vestido flores. i program my cd player to play only these 3 songs. if you want to dance and dance and dance try rumba argelia--all the songs on that cd are great.
3,Temporal does not exceed your expectations!,"Unlike their first effort, Rumba Argelina, Temporal does not take you seaward with soothing vocals and mystical melodies. Instead, Temporal brings you onto the street. The vocals are harsh, almost painfully produced, and the sound grinds to an urban rhythm. I was surprised at the difference between RT's first and second offering. If you are looking to purchase your first Radio Tarifa CD, buy Rumba... If you own Rumba and want to experience where these guys are going, than sacrifice your $15 plus on Temporal. But, you may want to tape it and give it away in the end."
5,KingOfThaSouth did it again!!!!,"This is one hot album those who don't have it, go get you this album! T.I. is one of the hottest rappers out there right now this one is really worth buyin that's for real. And go get his first album ""I'm Serious"" that's one classic album, I dare those to disagree with me on this!!"
1,This CD sucks.,"This Cd sucks don't buy it you should burn i't,but to tell you the truth it's not even worth burning. This Cd sucks."
1,Only good song is 24's,"This album sucked,because the only good song is 24's,and that's old by now anyway."
5,THE KING OF THE SOUTH,"this album is the album of the year hands down. TI rocked the album from the first to the last song. ""I'm Serious"" was a classic album and I gotta put this one on top of ""I'm Serious"" because the beats and flows are even tighter. Right now he is the king of the south, no doubt. With all that wit and cockiness,mixed in with realness, he reminds me of a dirty south Jay-Z and . If you ain't got this album go to the CD store and get it today. One of the best southern albums of ALL TIME, no lie."
2,Terrible,"When I buy a CD, I expected to like more then 3 or 4 songs out of 18. My expectations for this Cd were obviously way too high. This was a very disappointing CD because the beats weren't catchy enough to keep my attention."
4,"CD is good, go buy it.",T.I is great in this cd. One of his best. Good beats with lyrics make it worth listening to. Pick it up. 24's is best song. Overall better than average.
5,The Classic!!!,"Listen here, this is definately one of the coldest albums I have ever heard. If you don't believe me just listen fo' yo'self. T.I.is puttin' it down fo' tha SOUTH and thats pure honesty!!!"
5,Cold A** Album,"All around this is a cold album and deserves much recognition. He gotta style all his own that not too many can F**k wit. Personally, I feel I'm Serious is a better album, and that either way it goes T.I. is cold as hell...but I'll let you be the judge of that."
4,"More Like 4.5 out of 5 Stars, But Better Than The 1st Album","IMO, this album is better than the first album and that is saying a lot because I have had that in heavy rotation for over a year. Not only did the production improve on this album, but most importantly, T.I. has grown lyrically. This is evident on the tracks No Mo Talk, Long Live The Game, Kingofdasouth and I Still Luv U. In terms of production, Bezzle, Doin' My Job, Let's Get Away and Rubber Band Man are standouts. As with his other album, T.I. has something for a variety of audiences on here. He has some heartfelt and introspective joints(i.e. I Still Luv U, Be Better Than Me, Doin' My Job), uptempo joints(i.e. Bezzle, 24s, Rubber Band Man) and cuts for the ladies (i.e Let's Get Away and Let Me Tell You Something). This album is one of my favorites of the year, so far. This album further proves that T.I. can spit with the best of them and is continuing to improve with each album. I highly recommend this album as well as I'm Serious."
3,Not as good as I'm Serious,"A pretty dissapointing follow up to the smashing debut I'M SERIOUS...T.I. tries to make songs intentinally the will work on the charts , some great song yes but something definitly is missing...Nah u might as well skip this and go listen to I'M SERIOUS again"
3,Review of T.I.'s Trap Muzik,"T.I. started his career in 2001 with the release of his debut album I'm Serious, then returned in 2003 with his sophomore set Trap Muzik (which deserves 3.5 stars.) Compared to T.I.'s first album Trap Muzik is solid gold, but in reality it's only a bit better than a average hip-hop album.*I will rate the following tracks on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the best.*1. Trap Muzik - 5/102. I Can't Quit - 7/103. Be Easy - 8/104. No More Talk - 7/105. Doin' My Job - 7/106. Let's Get Away - 10/107. 24's - 10/108. Rubber Band Man - 10/109. Look What I Got - 9/1010. I Still Luv You - 7/1011. Let Me Tell You Something - 7/1012. T.I. vs. T.I.P. - 6/1013. Bezzle - 6.5/1014. Kingofdasouth - 7/1015. Be Better Than Me - 7.5/1016. Long Live da Game - 7/10~If you liked T.I. before you'll definently love him now and want to get this album. If you liked any of the singles ""24's"",""Be Easy"", ""Rubber Band Man"", or ""Let's Get Away"" you'll definently want to get this album.~"
1,Why isn't there a 0 or negative star rating,"Because this is crap. Actually to tell you the honest truth, crap is better. At least crap can be used a fertilizer or something. Crap is a compliment. How does that one guy know the word Monotonous? It sure wasn't on the T.I. Album. What the hell does T.I. stand for anyway? Total Imbecile? Go spend your money on some cow crap, at least crap makes flowers grow. The only thing that this makes grow is the nauseous feeling in my stomach when I hear the annoying anthem this dork belches."
2,At least its betta then Lil John or David Banner...,"Ive heard dis album, & it aint all dat, I'm Serious is betta....24 is a very weak single with a monotonous chorus...It figures that all the high reviews of this album are from the South..."
3,T.I,YO THIS ALBUM IS WEAKKK THESE GUYS ARE ONE HIT MAN 22'S WAS HOT BUT THE ALBUM ISN'T FOOD FOR THOUGHT BE EASY IS THE NEXT SINGLE BUT THAT AIN'T BAD BUT BEFORE THE WEEK OUT YOU WILL FORGET ABOUT THIS ALBUM DON'T BUY IT
5,I know what you heads are thinking,"how the hell can someone who single is about rims be dope well he is i know you think he is a disgrace to the south but your wrong you need to listen to this album and give it a chance T.I. is the best thing out the south since geto boys, Eightball and MJG and UGK don't pass this one overalso check out i'm serious his debut i enjoyed it more then this one9 of 10 lyrics 7 of 10 beats"
3,Decent But Not Sick,"Its an alright album, Not the best though because I dont think T.I is that great. But heres what I think on the tracks.#1.Trap Muzik - 1/5#2.I Cant Quit - 4/5#3.Be Easy - 3/5#4.No More Talk - 4/5#5.Doin My Job - 4/5#6.Lets Get Away - 2/5#7.24's - 2/5#8.Rubberband Man - 3/5#9.Look What I Got - 3/5#10.I Still Luv You - 3/5#11.Let Me Tell You Something - 4/5#12.T.I Vs T.I.P - 3/5#13.Bezzle - 4/5#14.King Of Da South - 3/5#15.Be Better Than Me - 5/5#16.Long Live Da Game - 3/5An alright album"
1,Someone Tell T.I. Game Over,"Lil Flip Is The New King Of The South ScarFace Move OverAnd For T.I. You Never Where Close From Being The King, You Just a Gold Artist And You Will Stay That Way. GAME OVER"
4,T.I too the Fullest,T.I kept it real gangster on this record. He was talking some real thangs. I could relate to this record which is hard to do now days with all these fake rappers. T.I hit many subjects and was giving good advice.
1,Crap Muzik,"I loved his last album. I loved the hit song 24's so I got this album. I was so disappointed.He has some nice beats but you will be let down by his lyrics. If you just like hot bass beats then buy this.But if you want beats and lyrics like me, you will probaly be let down.well I've said all I could. I hope this helped. I cant say anything more else but I didnt like it. But hey, everyone has an opinion"
5,Off tha Hook,"Full Album,no skits,into's,outro's, nothin but great beats, and killer flo's.To quote the man himself&quot;Set the style for Atlanta&quot;Songs to look out for:My Job,T.I. vs T.I.P.,rubberband man feat. david banner,long live da game, and all the tracks on this album.Get it!"
1,Not for a Casual Reader,"This is a poorly thought out piece of time travel fiction. It was bad when it was new and has not aged well. I am happy to have it for my library as a long missing Tucker for my collection, but do not recommend it to anyone."
4,Picks up the baton of C. Wright Mills,This is a tremendously well-written examination of the structure of power in America. It continues the ideas of Mills but with more of the empirical and less of the theoretical. A MUST-READ for anyone who claims to know how America is ruled. Simply stated--if this book doesn't get your blood boiling and move you to action then you have no right to complain about the present state of the American political system.
5,"funny, and great illustrations",I think the book was funny especailly the part when Mr. Rivera went fishing and caught Miss Belle. The illustrations are so funny and the story makes you laugh and happy.
2,Blade not Sharp,The blade on this came out of hte box dull. I have sharpened it with my sharpener and I hope it holds an edge..
4,Great for tackle box,"Great little filet knife, and because it folds, you can toss it in the tackle box with cutting yourself rummaging through it."
3,"Good Idea, not so good knife",this folding filet knife is very sharp right out of the box. but the size of the blade and the size of the handle make it very hard to use effectively. also the locking mecinism is terrible. it barely holds the blade open. and when i close the knife i can flick my wrist and have the blade swing into the open position. NOT SAFE. but other than that i have used it alot and it has earned a spot in my tackle box none the less.
5,Allegedly Good!,"I first heard three pieces of the Alleged Dances at a concert that featured Schnittke and Shostakovich, and there was nothing out of place in this piece. Now that I have heard the rest of Alleged Dances, it reaffirms my belief that here at last we have a composer of our time who is in tune with the times, who can be as classical or as pop as anyone and most importantly write good music that entertains as it does provoke.It is strange that people will call Brahms' Hungarian Dances""classical"" but not John's fabulous Alleged Dances. Adams here is far more sophisticated than Brahms, and he deserves to be up there with the greats.If anything, I was overjoyed to hear how Adams made the connection between what we call ""classical"" music and pop, reminding us that even back in Handel's time dance was the basis of music that we now call high art.Moo!"
2,Disappointing,"The second disc with works by John Adams I've been listening to, and already I can't help but wonder what has become of him. My first experience with Adams has been Harmonium, a work of breathtaking intensity and uplifting beauty - ten years later, he produces entertaining sections of noise which transport the impressiveness of old in nothing but being impressive examples of the fact that not everything coming out of instruments (or of a cow, for that matter) can actually be considered music.Gnarly Buttons seems to be a little less bad at first, but later on turns out to be just as stereotypical as most of the Dances.If you enjoy pop music performed on classical instruments, mainstream film music or light music in general, you might still enjoy this disc; perhaps your children will like it as well. Yet, bearing the name of John Adams, this is a huge disappointment."
2,Quartet is a dud!,One had great expectations for this Adams string quartet. Alas -- we get yet another (failed) attempt of Adams' to write pop tunes. Has he given up on writing concert works?
5,Masterpiece,"Why doesn't Boz recognize and pay tribute to these songs? This was from right before his ""disco"" breakout hits, but songs like Downright Women and Painted Bells deserve to be played live! Boz, you listening?In short, this is a hidden gem. If you like well-crafted and well-arranged songs, buy it!"
3,The BSC books are just as good!,"I think the Babysitters Club is VERRRY well written except for one thing. Claudia should not say ""Oh my Lord"" saying that is just as bad as saying OH MY GOD or something. NO matter what,She is swearing when she says that."
2,"Good book, but get real","I felt that this book was alright, but I thought the author is pretty naive to write that Dawn was shocked at the party when the kids were smoking and drinking. I know kids who do alot worse then that. If Dawn would just grow up, then she would realize that parties with underaged smokers and drinkers are very common. I used to like Dawn, but now she seems really babyish."
1,Well................,"The character Dawn was pathetic and the fact she was suprised that there was drinking and smoking at party is plain out stupid. Teens DO smoke, drink, do drugs, and have sex. So get over it. The author doesn't even have the charaters cus. In fact all the characters complained and were extremly immature and it was easy to tell that the author is out of touch with what goes on in the world today and the music they listin to? Come on!!"
1,This book (and the rest of the series) is terrible,"I was recommended this book and I was very dissapointed. This book seems like a take off of the baby sitters clud and I HATED those books. I'm sure there are a lot of people who enjoy the series, I don't mean to bash it, but I did not like it. It's a too touchy-friendly-lets-make-up-and-kiss kind of book....take my advice and don't bother reading this book or the series."
5,the best 1 so far,THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT DAWN'S LIFE. SHE GOES TO A PARTY AND HER FRIEND GETS DRUNK AND LOSES HER WALLET.THE PARTY WAS AT A TEACHERS HOUSE.THOSE OF YOU WHO SAYTHAT THE BSC IS DUMB...HELLO!!!!!!!THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD. SO: GET REAL!
4,heartfelt and belivable,I really liked this book. It was very sad with all the things going on in Dawn's life. I think that her and her friends are kind of selfish though. They are mean to Jill even though she is immature. There are other ways to tell her she needs to grow up. Other than that it was one of the best of all of the books.
3,dawn,"I chose this because I though it would be interesting. I also chose this it seemed like a book I would enjoy reading. I did not judge the book by it's cover. I read the back of the book first. The book, Dawn, is about a girl who is witing a diary of her own life. She talks about her friends and what she is going to do in life. My favorite part is when Dawn talks about the concert. I would recomend this book because it talks about girls my age."
3,Book,"This was a good book but dawn was wayy too immature, because of several reasons. First of all she sould have tried to understand Jill better and realize some people are different. I also think she was going wayyy over the top about every thing.She was like oh my gosh i am moving into a new building and i need moral support! Not really. She also could have tried to talk to Carol more and try to understand her. Other than that it was cool"
2,Upset,"As a baby-sitters club fan, I was completley and totally upset about finding out about the real Dawn. Dawn was my favorite charecter. Now I don't even buy the books anymore."
3,It was ok,"Well some of this book was good like the part when they went to the party, but I think Amalia's diaries are better."
5,this is the best book for young girls i've ever read!,"i enjoyed this book. it's about teenage girls, friendship, and general life in California. i reccomend this book to anyone between the ages of 12 and 16. it's one of my favorite books, and it's the first in a series of many."
5,It is an exellent book,I think that this book is really good. This is the type of book for people who out grew the Babysitters Club. There are bigger problems that Dawn faces and has to get out of. Also when read this book its in the form of a diary which is makes you closer to the characters this way too.
5,A GREAT IMPROVEMENT,"Dawn, sunny, and ALL THE CALIFORNIA DIARY BOOKS are great. even if u hated the bsc u have to try the CA Diaies. Their world isn't perfect, but fast and confusing. Real life issues. Makes u think. You'll love it. it is a little 'sad' or different from the bsc. i've read the bsc and it puts a whole new image on dawn and her friends life"
5,This is a very good book!,"""California Diaries: #1 Dawn"" is very good. I like that it is in the form of a diary. Instead of just telling what happens, you get to read about it from Dawn's point of view, with her own thoughts and ideas. I originally got this book for a friend. I read it before I gave it to my friend, but didn't think I'd like it. To my surprise, it was really good. I ordered #2 Sunny and can't wait to read it. If you liked Babysitters Club, you'll love California Diaries!"
5,A must read series!,"I have read almost all the books in the series. And I think every teenager would relate to at least one of these characters. The author takes you from a problem of feeling not good enough to becoming anorexic, and people you love the most dying from a diese, even trouble with a boyfriend etc.. If you do not think a book could relate to you than you have not look enough. Or if you just like snooping on other peoples private stuff, you would also enjoy these books. (Even though the charaters are fictional.)"
4,*THIS IS A MUST READ!*,"This book is a well-written one about a 13 yr. old grl called Dawn. She expresses what she does with her friends and family. She meets new friends like the postitive grl, Amalia. This book tells us about what Dawn's point of view of everything. This is a good chanz to find out what Dawn is thinking about her family and friends. This book is actually funny and interesting to read! If I were u, I would get this one and read it!"
5,a good introduction to the series,I thought this book was a good way to kick off the series. it was very well written and the part about the party was described in so much detail that it was like I was actually there. one part that I didn't like was dawn and her friends fight with jill. they could of at least tried to understand her instead of suddenly deciding that she was really immature. and dawn and her friends are faced with some really difficult choices while at the party that I thought helped make the book more realistic. this is a must read for people who like this series.
5,A great difference from the BSC,"At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but I read the reviews and I wanted to see how it turned out. Now I have to agree with most of everybody else: BSC is too unrealistic. The story focuses on everyday life, especially teenage problems which have something to do with High School. It seems refreshing to know that Dawn has a side different than the one shown in the BSC books. I think it's sad that Jill had to break it off with Dawn, even if she was babyish they could have tried to worked things out, but just like Dawn wrote, she wasn't sorry enough to patch things up. Now I'm getting hooked on the entire series and I'm looking for the Dawn's Journal 2 in local shops..."
1,Gallery Live Sessions,The person who claimed to have this CD really DID NOT have it. I got a refund pretty quick from Amazon. AVOID THIS SELLER IF YOU CAN.
4,Well Stitched together,"I enjoyed this one very much, so I bought all the others and was not disappointed. I really like the main character, she is real to me. Especially in the last book where she is depressed and having nightmares because of all that she has been through. In so many books the main character goes blithley on, unaffected by what they have witnessed or been entirely too close to. I have yet to do the patterns included in each one because, of course I already am stacked to the rafters with UFO's. In fact reading them made me drag out some of them and deal with them! I wish it was possible to read and stitch at the same time because I couldn't put these books down. It would be great to do like in Gone with the Wind, one reads out loud and everybody else is stitching. Much better than being blasted by the TV."
4,A Stitcher's Delight!,"When Betsy decides to figure out who murdered her sister - and to take over her sister's needlework store, I knew I was hooked on this book. But what a dilemma - to stitch or to read? The characters are a delight - and not unlike those who inhabit my local needlework hangout; and the ""who dun it"" is a joy to unravel. I felt I was in the store - and uncovering the clues. I hope there are sequels."
4,An interesting setting for this new series.,"Although I enjoyed Crewel World, I was disappointed that Margot was the victim. I originally thought she would have been a better choice for the protagonist. Betsy did grow on me, however, as the book progressed. The setting of the stitchery shop was an unusual one, and the author made good use of the theme for both the title and the plot. A good cozy choice."
3,simple but pleasant mystery,"Like so many other readers here, I too, was able to figure out who the murderer was about half-way through the book. The plot was a bit simple and the characters weren't always consistent. But it was a fun read--filled with humor."
4,Entertaining,"A very entertaining mystery! Although the only draw back was that I was able to guess the killer half way through the book. But it didn't deter me from enjoying the rest of the story. As an avid needleworker, the setting is particularly enjoyable. Monica Ferris is great a captivating the ""stash mentality"" of a stasher! Great! It also helps that r.c.t.n gets some notice and is a sign of the times! This brings the whole story closer to home for me as I also read r.c.t.n.This mystery is by no means meant only for craftspersons. I hope that more individuals who may not be interested in needlework pick up the book as well as the crafts :)"
4,American cozy,"This is, I think, an excellent example of the American cozy. Similiar to the British genre in that you have a small group of characters that drive the story. I have read all four in the series so far. What I think I like most is the needlework background for the titles. This is somewhat like Dick Francis books always having horses or racing in the storyline. Quite often too, the main character is in trouble because of something they don't know they know. A good read for a rainy afternoon."
4,"A fun ""Cozy"" mystery",This book is set in a suburb of Minnesota. Being familiar with the area makes it more fun to read. I am looking forward to the next in the series to learn how Betsy's knitting is progressing!
4,Small town murder mystery at it s best,The nuances and gossip of a small Minnesota town rise to the top in this murder mystery. New age politically correct culture mixed with traditional hobbies makes this book an easy and delightful read.
4,Crewel world,"I loved this book and found it very interesting. I would like to read some more of Monica Ferris work, Lilian Beazer"
3,Haven't had a problem yet,"These were way less expensive than the other inner tubes and offered free shipping with 25 dollars spent. So far, they are a good tube, have been using in an off road stroller for about a month now."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this replacement tire tube for my son's bike, but once we put it on and started blowing it up, green slime immediately started pouring out?! My husband didn't even get the tire blown up completely before it started leaking from the valve. Thinking it might just be a slow leak and because the green slime is supposed to fix flats, we figured we would continue to blow it up and see if it sealed itself...it never did. Now I'm out $6 and my son still doesn't have a bike to ride."
1,BUYER BEWARE - Product Died,"After 2 months of normal use, this product died. Nothing turned on anymore and wasn't even recognized in the USB plug. When it worked, it's volume was low, sound quality poor and cheaply designed. Do not waste your money on this junky product."
3,Other than a handful of good songs I'm not interested,"I prefer Blue Rodeo when the bands either rocks or is eclectically jazzy (Rob Wiseman's influence on keyboards). They lose me with the dirge-like country ballads. Lost Together has thirteen songs spread over almost 70 minutes. Good start and finish with the Dylanesque Fools Like You and the rocker Angels. In between I can find a few songs that I enjoy - the Poco inspired Western Skies - the excellent Willin' Fool, this is my favourite style for Blue Rodeo, keyboards are a key element - The moving title song. And that's all she wrote as far as I'm concerned. I neither like nor dislike the remaining songs. I just find them boring."
4,Provocative book -- A very good read,"Reading the other customer comments you can see that this book will upset many readers of 'strong faith.' In addition, there are a few that say material in this book has been written by Dawkins elsewhere before.Well, this is the first book of his I have read, and I found it to be provocative and very interesting. He tends to put down those who believe in 'something larger' besides the theory of evolution, which wasn't really necessary except to bring out loud counterarguments in the reviews from those folks.The best parts of the book were the clear, logical, and interesting examples of natural selection. It has been said that gaining new perspective is one of the most powerful things you can learn. This book will definitely give you a new perspective on the world around you, and will be a short and interesting read in the process. Enjoy."
2,Dawkins is Repeating Himself,"Let me start out by saying that I am a great admirer of Richard Dawkins. I find his work, especially 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Extended Phenotype' to be extremely enlightening and a joy to read.Sadly, in this book Dawkins largely repeats himself and at the same type manages to down-scale his arguments for less capable readers.In short, if you've read other works by Dawkins and have a healthy dose of scientific education this book will often be boring.I highly reccomend 'The Selfish Gene'"
4,Thought-provoking and entertaining,"The book of a great thinker. You don't have to follow him on every detail to benefit from his train of thought. His book is not only thought-provoking about what evolution and life are, it is also entertaining. Don't miss his story about a secret message transmitted by a virus. Learn also what could explain the evolution of the food signaling danse of the bees. For me, if Dawkins too often writes as if genes were always running the show of life, he still is a good debater and an antidote against mystical ideas. A must for all inquisitive minds!"
5,Regarding Science-Ejected Vitalism:,"Vitalism is a hugely science-ejected concept, though many CAM or 'natural health' cabals claim that vitalism survives scientific scrutiny.A few favorite quotes from this book:""after Watson and Crick, we know that genes themselves [...] are long strings of pure digital information [...] the genetic code [...is] a quaternary code, with four symbols [...] the machine code of the genes is uncannily computer-like [...] this digital revolution at the very core of life has dealt the final, killing blow to vitalism -- the belief that living material is deeply distinct from nonliving material [p.017...] there is no spirit-driven life force, no throbbing, heaving, pullulating, protoplasmic [p.018], mystic jelly. Life is just bytes and bytes of digital information [p.019]."""
3,The Blind Watchmaker is Better,"This book was good for showing how DNA is digital, but I think The Blind Watchmaker is a much better book. If you are trying to choose among Dawkins's books, I would start with The Blind Watchmaker."
5,Great Introduction for Beginners,"Richard Dawkins is a great Darwanian defender and a mayor evolution thinker. This book is a marvellous introduction to evolution and his ideas. You may not agree 100% with Dawkins, but it is irrefutable that his theories are worth considering, and what's more important, his view of life is clarifying. If you are not an expert and just want to have a general perspective of evolution or want to know what's all the fuzz about creationists a evolutionists, well, this is a really good book to begin.Just a final note, if you are familiarized with Dawkins works you may feel this book too basic. It will be better to try some of his other works."
2,This was a bestseller?,"Dawkins must not have been trying very hard in this one. A lot of different ideas - most of them repeats of stuff he's done before (and since) - the sort of thing he can apparently do without thinking too hard about it. If you've read Dawkins before, you'll know the sort of thing: natural selection, Argument from Personal Incredulity, etc. Okay, he has kind of linked everything to his title, the idea of humanity being a gene flow from our remotest ancestors, but it still has a sense of being cobbled together for a quick sale. His examples are mostly good ones, but so well known they're virtually cliches - Tinbergen's sticklebacks, von Frisch's bees, Fabre's hunting wasps. (What? No Lorenz-imprinted geese? Maybe he's keeping that for later.)He does have a facile style, and I must admit he had me smiling in a couple of places, particularly with the idea of God creating superbly adapted cheetahs and antelopes with the idea of maximising David Attenborough's ratings."
4,life is boring.,"i just read this book and had a very good time of it. i enjoyed ""the selfish gene"", but find it too be a bit dense (not hard to understand; but a lot more examples than needed to illustrate the theory). i also appreciate how dawkins is able to cover a lot of ground/history in a small amount of space; never too detailed to get boring, but never leaving anything unexplained. my one gripe concerns memes, which are mentioned in this book... i think dawkins is way off with memes, and i hope that doesn't detract from the quality of his work on the whole.so: a nice refresher for people like myself who are interested in this sort of thing but don't have the time to delve too deeply into it. i would recommend this book to anyone whith questions concerning evolution."
4,That's Life.,Dawkins leads us through evolutionary theory with a wittyvoice and an eye for wonder. A good entre to both Dawkinsand the science of evolution.
3,Nothing new,If you've read 'The Blind Watchmaker' you've also read this book. The whole book reads like a new frontend to Dawkin's standard argument. There is nothing substantial new here.
5,Dawkins tackling the same subject again,"Richard Dawkins has only veered from the subject of evolution in his books once (Unweaving the Rainbow). So it will come as no surprise that to long time Dawkins readers that 'River Our of Eden' takes down familiar paths. Indeed anyone who has read 'The Blind watchmaker' or 'Climbing Mount Improbable' has seen this material before. But what I think stands out so very much about 'River' is what an outstandingly lucid, eloquent, and rewarding introduction to Evolutionary theory it is. Dawkins is always an eloquent writer, capable of handling metaphor in ways that don't confuse the reader (Dawkins never drops a metaphor without explaining in the fullest detail). I think this should be required reading in all AP biology classes. It is a beautiful introduction to Evolutionary theory, that also exposes readers to the deep philosophical unease many people feel about the subject."
5,Where's the DVD?,"Great show, waiting for the DVD. If you're like me go to DisneyDVD.com and you can put in a request to be notified when the DVD comes out. The more requests the better chance Disney will put this out on DVD. Come on Dinosaurs lovers let Disney know . . . We Want Our Dinosaurs DVDs!!!"
5,"Please, please reissue these again!!","10 years later, this show is STILL the talk of our office! ""Dinosaurs"" was absolutely amazing back then...and it would still be a big hit ..."
4,A new name for the same great artist,"Roland Orzabal is back after a 5 year hiatus with a new album under his own name. This recent offering is reminiscent of many songs from his last TFF album, Raoul and the Kings of Spain. With Alan Griffiths and many of the band who joined him on his RATKOS tour joining in, this album is drawing it's influences from many the same places as the last Tears For Fears Album. This single and many others from the WildCats album are a continuation of the direction taken by Roland on his last album.Low Life is the first of atleast three hits from this album and hopefully the first of many new works from the artist under his own name.I would strongly recommend this album to all follows of Roland and his work. You won't be dissappointed."
2,Lost Potential,"Low Life is an incredible song. One of the best of the year. It is also the type of song that screams for a remix. It is layered, has several different sections where the song varies, and has a great beat that could be manipulated for a remix. It's a re-mixer's dream and I was very exicted to see the results. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed in the re-mixes. They basically stuck in some rapper who repeats a stupid line over and over and basically ruins everything about the song. Yuck. What a shame. Get a new remix outfit Roland!! The single version is just the album version minus a few bars to cut the time down as expected.By the way, the album is great. It combines Roland's classic melodies and hooks with a nice new, trip-hop feel. Highly recommended--just don't get the remix single."
5,Roland Keeps Rollin' !!!,"I'll leave the other [...] to try and out-do each other with their attempts at glossy, wanna-be-professional critic verbage in describing Roland Orzabal's new album. Instead, I'll use simple words like phenomenal, fantastic, and fat! to describe this killer new release. Listen to it twice in a row and it'll make you want to listen to it at least once a day after that. How does this man keep things fresh and constantly improving with each new release? As much as I LOVED TFF and having Curt Smith's distinct voice be a part of the band, Roland keeps proving that not only does he not need the TFF moniker anymore, but that he was the true talent in the band all along!! If there's anything negative I can share it's the fact that Roland keeps us waiting too long between studio releases!"
5,This book contains valuable information!,"I found this book to be filled with very useful and valuable information about an aspect of my health that I hadn't really thought about, namely how ""healthy"" bacteria impact our health. I think most people automatically think that bacteria are ""bad."" In fact, ""good"" bacteria are as essential for our health as vitamins and minerals, maybe more so. Although this book is filled with scientific information, I as a non-scientist found it very easy to understand and use. Not only is the information presented very valuable, there is an excellent resource section in the book that helps you find even more information through books, websites, and companies. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in improving your health."
1,Disappointed,I am very disappointed with the tapes. There was only 2-3 minutes of information that I found useful.
5,An excellent film for anyone interested in American politics,"An engrossing and well-structured film that succinctly explains Bush's victory in Ohio, and thus the United States in the presidential election of 2004. The film's use of three main characters to frame the narrative gives the film a personal quality, and prevents it from becoming a dry recitation of facts that poorer documentaries often become.As a non-American, I heartily recommend this film to anybody with an interest in American politics, and how electioneering there differs from other English-speaking countries."
5,Can't say enough,"Ry Cooder definately struck gold in putting together this group. Barbarito Torres on the laute is exceptional and the singing, very profession. I can see why this album has brought so much attention to Cuban Music, especially the ""soneros."""
3,"Ry, oh ry!","oh WHY did you do this? Who flies all the way to cuba, tracks down some great musicians, makes a fantastic documentary about cuban music, then plays incongruous guitar parts all over their work on the soundtrack album?Chan Chan is a wonderful piece of music, well rendered, with a bizarra addition of a blues slide guitar on it... oo I wonder WHO could've been the culprit. Whoever that guitarist is, he musta been friendly with the producer to get THAT onto the track...Track 2 I thought had escaped his attention until on the second listen I hear tuneless twanging of the parts of the guitar strings the wrong side of the neck or nut. Clearly TRYing to sound like a cowbell, and doing a reasonable job. They sound a lot like a cowbell being played by someone who's not played a cowbell much before. Even more, they sound like a pasty white guy trying to get in on the party with these consummate cubanos.Gah. That's enough for now. I'm off to listen to some nuyoricanmambo to cool down."
1,Que Lástima!,"Que Lástima ver a los maestros de la música cubana teniendo que aguantar a un músico tan mediocre como Ry Cooder, a quien se le ocurrió que una guitarra electrica (pobremente tocada con slide de blues además) va bien con el mas puro son de Cuba?. Es muy triste ver lo que músicos tan consagrados y legendarios tienen que hacer, aceptar y soportar por un poco de difusión fuera de la isla.Si busca un verdadero documental sobre la musica afro cubana busque ""Calle 54"", es en verdad excelente!!"
1,Lost 4 stars thanks to Cooder,"Great proof that slide guitar doesn't go with everything. Should have been subtitled ""How to Ruin Good Music."" The bad news is that there is a whole world of music for Cooder to butcher in his inimitable way."
4,Great music!,"The songs on this soundtrack have excellent music. The words are sometimes annoying, because they are in spanish, but it is worth buying!"
4,Buena Vista Social Club,"I learned of this cd from a Spanish language course and followed up on it. I enjoy the music very much, as well as the fact that the CD is accompanied by a pamphlet containing the words to the songs."
4,Fantastic album!,This album is superb. If I could listen to this cd all day I would! If you enjoy this kind of music then I highly suggest you also purchase Angel Melendez and the 911 Mambo Orchestra's cd.It is absolutely superb.
2,take the first Buenavistasocial club CD!,"compares with the first cd, this one is only an other average cuban cd, the passion and love is missing here."
3,Great - would be better if Ry Cooder weren't playing,"After many playings, the element that is wrong here refuses to go away - in fact, it just gets worse. Buena Vista Social Club is a fabulous album, and has brought international exposure to some great musicians. Unfortunately, Ry doesn't swing. Every time he touches his guitar, a country flavour comes into the music as out of place as mayonnaise on black beans and rice. It's as if he's mistaken slinky for a lack of attack. Ry Cooder obviously loves and respects the music of Cuba, but Tex-Mex into Son doesn't go."
5,beauty needs no understanding,"With only limited Spanish-speaking skills, I cannot begin to fully understand what Ibrahim Ferrer and Co. are singing about. It really doesn't matter, though -- the music's beauty shines brightly through the darkness of my ignorance.The Cuban folk music is truly a beautiful blend of plucked guitars, a light sprinkling of brass, and some soft piano and clean drumming for accompanyment. Although you may not speak Spanish, it is a beautiful language nonetheless -- another sweet instrument, if you will, that lilts and floats over the rest of the music.This album really brings back great memories of traveling in Mexico: the images of the desert; the poor, dusty villages; the enchantment of the Sierra Madres; the amiable, heartwarming nature of the natives -- it's all here. Every listen is a trip to a place far away but not forgotten. If you have ever taken a trip to not just Cuba, but any Latin American country, I think this music should be a part of you."
4,Refreshing and Traditional!!!,"As someone that grew up in Havana in the 50s, I enjoyed this CD a lot. I must admit that I was not totally familiar with some of the musicians on this band as I have been away from Cuba for almost 40 yrs and it wasn't until this came out that I became acquainted with them. Their music is another story. I am very familiar with this music that reminds me of my happy childhood. The harmony and professionalism shown by these masters is remarkable. It appears that some of them felt reborn by doing this recording as they appear to have been forgotten or ignored for years. I saw their video as well and they looked alive and happy like little kids. The songs were wonderful and the arrangements were smooth. CD's like this do not come along very often. It is great cuban traditional music at it best!!!!!"
5,"Beuna Vista,","Equiste, the most beautiful music I have ever had the pleasure of listening too..If you don't belive me ask Mitty."
5,Lovely CD Thanks to Ry Cooder,"I came to this page today to buy my 3rd copy of this CD, and I would like to say a few words to those who pick on Ry Cooder for taking such an active musical role in this project. Last week I also bought a CD by Ibrahim Ferrer, and while attractive, it does not come anywhere near Buena Vista Social Club. Cooder was the one who pulled off the entire project - without him Ferrer would still be shining shoes for a living in Cuba. Great artist he is - but Cooder is an even greater director."
4,Great collection of Cuban artists but.....,"Wonderfull eclectic mix of Cuban talent, but recording seems to lack dynamics and feels a little distant. Still recommend it, anything Ry Cooder has touched has a little magic in it."
4,Cooder goes Cuba,"The nice thing about this CD, is that Ry Cooder steps back and let's the Musicians weave their tale of life, hardship, love and of course their homeland. I am a big fan of Cuban music, maybe I will one day go to Cuba, though maybe Fidel will be replaced by someone more of an American puppet than he. The great thing about this CD, is that it's available for everyone, and that my friends is the Cuban way."
3,I bought this album because of the film.,"I was not familiar with this kind music and was very pleased with the documentary about the musicians. I find that I was much more interested in the people than in the music. As I play the CD, the music does not hold the same appeal that it did when I could see the players in action. I probably would not recommend this to someone unless they listen to it first."
2,Over-rated,"Sorry, but based on all the reviews I was expecting some fantastic cuban flavoured salsa. Instead this sounds like some pathetic combination of bad lounge Hawaiian and b class Mexican influenced band. If this is the best of Cuba, then maybe the US trade embargo was a good thing after all."
1,Sad,"It saddens me to think that 7 million Cubans suffer everyday from political oppression and the lack of everyday necessities and we think these productions are just dandy. Of course the music is great, but having US dollars flow into the communist government's laps in not the situation we want to have. How much of the cash do you think Ruben Blades sees off of his work...very little.Enjoy the music but don't forget the real story."
1,"No, it's really not very good","I'm sorry but this is not a listenable CD. This is the standard repetitious Latin music we pass over on the radio every day. Although the performers are legends within the Cuban music community, to a listener whose ears have been conditioned to the jazz, pop, country and classical of regular old USA offerings, it's not interesting. It is better when someone like Carlos Santana or Al DiMeola interprets it and filters it. It is not very good otherwise. I would prefer listening to a faucet drip, rats in the attic or fingernails on a chaulkboard. If I could, I would give it zero stars."
2,What Ever,"You know what,get over it,if a dedicated cubafile like me is sick of seeing this album since it's concept still here,you need a life,Cuban music has nothing to do with these,be it as it may good preforms,live life Go on ex4plore,grow,if you realy try life outside,even if Castro falls down in national papers ,a list is much more refreashing!!!!"
5,Amazing!,"I bought this cd before it became as popular as it has done in the past 6 months or so here in Australia. I love the easy, relaxing melodies, and the songs which make you get up and dance. This was the first latin cd i bought, and i was blown away by the sound produced! An excellant cd, what in earth are people complaining about the addition of a slide guitar for..?"
4,cooder is distracting,The Cubans are great. Ry Cooder's slide guitar is distracting and does not fit the style at all. His son's (Joachim Cooder) choice of eclectic percussion is at least understated enough not to be distracting. It's too bad the money will not reach those whose lives and sweat went into this music but to the likes of Ry Cooder and Fidel Castro.
5,I wish I were Cuban,"This CD with it's Cuban Heart, with traces of a Multiracial Soul is the best Music I heard in a long time. It's like falling in love."
5,"Saw the movie, bought the CDs, have tickets to see them live","Rarely in our frenetic cicadian lives does an opportunity come along that can transport us so effectively that we can stop being ourselves for a little while and we can imagine life someplace else where material everything is not within reach, where even in simplicity, music as fine as anything produced in our studios is an everyday occurrence. I think about the movie and its stars every day. I long for their simplicity. I am looking forward to their visit to Chicago this November. I will be cheering them loudly!"
5,Musical treat,"Ry Cooder had a musical brainstorm when he put together this album. We are able to hear all the greats of Cuban music on this album, and it doesnt disappoint the listener. The album can become adictive and you will want to listen to it all the time. One of the best CDs I've bought in along time"
5,Dios Mio!,"Dear Mr. Cooder... You never know quite what to expect, but you can bet it will be good. This one is better than good. Flabbergasting is more like it. There's some dead serious musicianship going on here! Not only that but it lives and jumps and hops. If you're looking for a bit of Latino spice for your music collection ese esta el numero uno!"
5,see the movie that followed the recording. pure magic.,"The reason music is so powerful is the artist allows the soul to open and feel the emotions that words can not... The world is lucky that Ry had the energy and spirit to endure to un-known and dig into history. The movie that documents the recording and so much more, gave me even a deeper appriciation for the band. ..All fans of the BVSC should thank Ry for creating such a snapshot of artists who we are lucky enough to have gotten a chance to record."
5,Smooth stuff,I must agree this is Ry Cooter's best career achievment. After having lived in Miami and having absorbed Cuban music and culture. Political ideology put aside these musician's can only stir the Cubanismo in all of us who love latin music.
4,ry cooder goes to cuba,"I RECENTLY DISCOVERED RY COODER AND HIS MUSIC HAVING HEARD HIS CONTRIBUTION ON LITTLE VILLAGE.BUT I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE MUSICANS THAT JOINED HIM ON BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB. THE MUSIC GENERATED BY THIS EXTRODINARY CUBAN MUSICANS BRINGS A TYPE OF MUSIC THAT PUTS THE LISTENER IN A SMALL CLUB IN HAVANA PRE-CASTRO.THE SOUND IS, RICH AND MELODIC AND IS SO SMOOTH IT IS DIFFICULT TO PICK OUT WHAT INSRUMENTS ARE BEING PLAYED. THE ONLY DRAWBACK TO TH CD IS A LACK OF TRANSLATION OF THE LYRICS SO THE LISTENER CAN UNDERSTAND THEM.MUCHAS GRACIAS TO COODER AND THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB"
5,Everyone who enjoys music should own this record.,"This is a brilliant work, crafted around fantastically gifted musicians and great production. It's soul-moving music. Please buy it."
4,great introduction,a truly classic album that has introduced many listeners to the various Cuban rhythms. An excellent (perhaps better) companion is the first album from the Afro-Cuban All-Stars.
3,Not the Outstanding Performance I Expected,"As an avid Cuban music collector I was excited by the reviews, but disapointed after listening to the recording. The sound is fair, but lacks the ""son"" of past great Cuban perfomers such as Blanca Rosa Gil, Benny More, Celeste Mendoza, Nico Mambiela, Trio La Rosa, and the great Trio Matamoros. The Buena Vista ""boys"" grew up hearing these great Cuban musicians of the '40 and '50s, which strongly influenced their own music. Overall, the recording is fine. I suggest listening to ""Esto Era Cuba Chaguito"", ""Guajira y Son"", ""Cubanisimas Vol.1"", ""Cuba L.A."", ""Son de Cuba"", ""Matancera Romantica"", and ""Guajiras - Los Violines de Prego""."
2,Too general for my purposes,"I found this book to be far too general for my purposes. I was looking for much more detailed product reviews. I also found it annoying that Mr. Lipper was so heavily biased toward independent juvenile products stores (e.g. the store he manages in New York). He made himself out to be an expert, given his vast experience in selling baby products to expectant parents. However he doesn't have children of his own, so he has never really tested any of these products in real life experience. Don't bother with this book if you are a first time parent and need the nitty gritty details about baby products. Instead, I'd suggest you buy the Baby Bargains book by Denise and Alan Fields. They have two very young children and have actual experience with the products that they list in their book. Also, they are not biased toward any one type of store. They advise parents to shop around. I would rate the Fields book 5 stars and can't give more than 2 stars to Lipper's."

2,Keep Looking,"I purchased this book while I was 16 months pregnant. I'm a college educated woman who didn't know the difference between a crib and a cradle. I figured this book could help. The descriptions of the products were informative and the ""must have"" and ""might want"" labels were helpful. The problem I found was that the book didn't really prepare me when I dropped by my local baby store to register. The car seat models, crib models, etc. were old. The baby industry changes rapidly along with the number of recalls. I found the Baby Bargins book (and website) by Denise and Alan Fields a better consumer guide. Baby Stuff helped me decide which items were necessities, while Baby Bargins helped me decide which brands were top rated by both Consumer Reports and real life parents. If you buy this book, be prepared to keep looking for more information."
1,Worst baby book I have read yet.,"This book is nothing more than a 200 page advertisement telling you why you should only buy your baby stuff at an independent store (which the author of course owns), and not at a big chain, yard sale, ""mega-mall"", etc.. Oh, and the author has no kids!! Lol, 'nuff said. Don't waste your money. I own a used bookstore, that's how I stumbled across this gem. I just hope no inquiring customers ask me what I thought of it or it will be on my shelves forever. p.s. Did I mention this book is written for rich and/or stupid folks only? My favorite part is on page 85, where the author recommends combs (and I quote) ""Tiffany's sells sterling silver sets for boys at $265 and for girls at $415."" Is this guy for real?!?"
4,"A good book for learning Flash MX, especially videos","As a Flash MX newbie, I was looking for actionscript for a hierarchical menu that can be moved around the stage. I was lucky to find one working in one of the lessons on the CD. However, I had to go to another of his books (0-7645-1637-X) in order to see what is in the custom component!The QuickTime lessons are about 5 min long and are well produced and suitable for the topics for quick learning; watching the video clips is often faster and more lucid than reading the text. If you have them playing in the background, you probably can pickup some tips by osmosis ;-). I read this book at the local library. The author is well organized and a pleasure to read and watch his videos."
2,You Could Do a Lot Better,"Doug Sahlin may be a great Flash user, but he would do well to stay away from creating vocal narratives. Nobody can be good at everything, Doug. Also, I guess I must have put on own spin on the term 'virtual classroom', because I was expecting there to be 'lessons' that would lead me through a series of 'assignments' that would lead to the accomplishment of a certain task, the goal of the chapter. This is how teaching in a real classroom might happen, but not here - there are step-by-step instructions for performing tasks, but they do not lead to any final goal."
2,Oh-hummm,"Doug Sahlin's voice may put you to sleep on the CD-ROM. If you manage to stay awake, you will hear & see what he is doing but trying to duplicate it is another thing! Both the layout of the book & the content of the CD-ROM LACK LUSTER. The free stuff listed on CBTcafe.com made me a lot more excited & taught me more about Flash's capabilities than this book or CD. There are many Flash MX books out there - skip this one!"
4,Significant evolution?,"Well this is the follow-up to the excellent Hard-rock bottom. Which was just as good (if not better) than More betterness. It was already obvious form these two releases that the band decided to decelerate a bit and adopt a sound somewhat softer than their earliest releases. With this one the trend is clear. It doesn't sound like a punk hard-core band anymore. It is closer to pop. Yes, believe me! Yet, it is really easy to identify this as being a No Use album. The lyrics are very good, as usual. Probably much more political than on any other release of the band. It's less catchy than usual also. Much more uniform. However, I find it nice. But probably many fans will be disappointed because it's very slow and melodic (the pop way). Anyway, it's worth trying."
4,Grows on you quickly.,"I'll admit, my first listen disappointed me. Every NUFAN fan knows that they've been progressing away from the aggressive vocal style that made most of us fall in love with them, and the latest album continues in that direction. It's hard to get past that on first or second listen, especially with some of the slightly stranger songs such as Divine Let Down, but with repeated plays you'll find that the melodies here have never been stronger, the songwriting is still top notch, and there's actually more fast stuff on here I believe than their last album or two. I'm confident that any No Use fan will grow to love this album; it may not be your favorite but it's still classic No Use For A Name."
3,A decent attempt,This album doesn't rise to the same caliber as the legendary Leche con Carne but it still does not dissapoint. I recommend buying it used.
1,"Keeping us confused, allright....","The album is horrible. Can't say ANYTHING good about it. Last time I checked NO use for a name was a punk band. Now they are.....................the Backstreetboys in disguise.Tony Sly should try singing R&B; or something, he could do choruses on the new Puff Daddy album, I mean WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS GUY!!!! I recommend a smoking and whisky diet.Hard Rock Bottom wasn't exactly a masterpiece but it had it's moments. This hasn't. If you're a guy and you like this... you have a problem. I recommend this for 13 year old girls only."
3,The politics don't do it for me.,"If you agree with NUFAN's political stances this album would be for you. The songs are similar to what was found on Hard Rock Bottom musically, but lyrically they are much more politically charged. I love their sound and there is some great musicianship displayed on this release. However, I found the lyrics to ""Killing Time"" to be in poor taste. I have no qualms about bands that speak out against the war, the current administration and the state of american society, but that song is nothing more than troop bashing. The song calls our soldiers sheep and portrays the message that their duty is worthless and that they're only commiting suicide by serving their country. Like i said before, if you agree with their stances then this would probably be a five star album for you, there is nothing wrong musically here.Recommended tracks: Part 2, For Fiona, Apparition"
1,Don't waste your time.....,"This was awful! I rented it for free, and it wasn't even worth my time! Not even tv-movie-of-the-week quality.....Avoid at all costs!"
5,Good Bookcase,"It's a good book case with nice adjustable shelves... kinda heavy (which would be the case for a wood shelf) )and the instructions are a bit hard to understand in some parts, but overal not bad. The Drawer was tricky to put in. the instruchtions set a specific spot to place the track, which made the drawer stickout a bit, but there are other small pre-drilled holes so you can adjust it without having to guess, which is nice."
1,Weather Radio is plagued with problems,"This weather radio is plagued with problems. It appears to have design flaws or poor quality control. I have returned these units several times only to get another with still different problems. This is ashame. The intent in the design appears to have been superb, but yet the resulting product is plagued with problems, such as, not receiving the NOAA test signals or alerts, not receiving the NIST clock signal, going off in the middle of the night with ""Radio Reception Error - Listen to Broadcast"", and no solution except to unplug the radio and remove the batteries. Getting replacement units from the manufacturer or returns to seller does not correct the problem. I have given up on the WX-268."
2,"Problem with ""Radio Reception Error-Listen to Broadcast"" alert","This weather alert radio would be great, except that it constantly sounds the alert tone, flashes the warning light, and displays ""RADIO RECEPTION ERROR-LISTEN TO BROADCAST"" on the screen. This happens several times a week, when there are NO alerts being broadcast. As a result, this product is unusable and will be returned."
4,You gotta get this Album!!,"Antony Santos' 12th Album, ""Sin Ti"", came by surprise since he was still promoting his previous studio and live albums. This album continues the same stuff where he last left off, including a merengue/son track , ""Camarera"".This 11-track LP has 6 bachatas/5 merengues!""Sin Ti"", ""Ahora"", and ""La Jaula de Oro"" are the really good bachatas here with the articulate production being ""top-notch"".""Camarera"",""Las Varias"", and ""Tu Gato Triste"" are the really good merengues with the continued use of the saxs' and keyboard.Overall, he has continued giving people what they want: BACHATA Y MAMBO!! YESS!! ANTONY SANTOS!!"
3,vague like all Chilton,"This book covers 3 different models (Frontier, Xterra, Pathfinder) with 3 different engines (2.4L, 3.3L, 3.5L) with manual and automatic transmissions and 2 and 4 wheel drive. Probably 1/3 or more of the material is the general information on engine rebuilding, cooling systems, body repair, etc. that is included in every Chilton book ever printed.If you own a 2.4L 4x2 Frontier ('98-'00 is best, '01+ is still ok) then you'll get the most information. The vehicle they ""tear down"" appears to be a 1998 2.4L 4x2 with auto. The procedures are ok and the pics are mediocre to poor. The wiring diagrams along with the locations of various components are probably the most useful information.The 3.3L Xterra and 4x4 Frontier have some material, but not as much as 2.4L Frontier. The Pathfinder has the least amount of dedicated material and is probably not worth the price of this book."
4,like it because it complete book even if it was little bit up,"I like that it was delivery fast, even if it was little bit up, I rate it 4 star because it didnt mention anything about the little damage on the out side other then that it was what I expected, other wise i would have rated 5 star, I will recommend it to my friends and family"
2,dated (not in a good way),"I'm not really feeling this rekkid.The production and rapper's lyrical style are dated -- and I say ""DATED"" not in a good way. As far as nostalgia, K-Solo had his place in the early Nineties, but his art has NOT withstood the test of time. This album is simply not ""up to par"" with other works from that era. K-Solo's flow becomes redundant... same ol' same ol'. Sorry, kid!"
3,I wanted to give this book 5 stars,"I loaned this book to a friend with dog troubles. She gave it back to me explaining that she couldn't finish it. The book was just too large. She was just too busy to process it all.This is ironic as Fennel's methods easily blend into ordinary daily person <-> dog interactions and are very simple.The problem is that the book is 4 times larger than it needs to be. Her methods could have been explained in about 50 - 100 pages with plenty of room left over for some illustrative anecdotal accounts.A good editor could have saved this book.The same goes for her video, which I found terribly disjointed. If I had not read the book I would not have understood what she was trying to communicate.Fennel's methods are truly innovative, cruelty free, cheap, and practical. I hope she decides to hire an editor for her books and her videos to make her ideas easily accessible.It could make a difference in the lives of many dogs"
1,Don't bother!,"I have been training dogs professionally for just over five years now and am always interested in finding ways to make training gentler, more natural, and easier all the way around. This book is simply a rehash of a theory based on wolf packs. The problem with this is that dogs are not wolves, although they share some of the same characteristics, and we, humans, are not dogs. Dogs recognize this difference between us and them, although the author does not seem to. She seems to apply the same solution to every single problem, barring physical illness or injury, that a dog could have. Her writing is not the best, and her editor wasn't as helpful as she could have been. Save your money and invest in one of Karen Pryor's books."
4,One star off for style.,"My dogs love the method. One in particular was delighted to give up responsibility for me.The big news from her is contained in the assertion that separation anxiety problems in dogs are not the product of wondering where Mommy and Daddy are, but rather frantically worrying about the dogs' children--i.e., the people who think they're the owners. And that to me makes it different from all the other books who tell you that you need to be the alpha in your household.I haven't reread the first part, but I wasn't impressed the first time by her science. It would be nice to have had a table on the four steps of Amichien Bonding. But Major thinks it's wonderful. For the first time he reminds me of the ritual of going for a walk."
5,The Dog Listener,"I have five unruly dogs that I needed some serious help with. Jan gave me the anwers in this book. After investing countless hours and hundreds of dollars on other obedience books and classes, I am trying Jan's Amichien Bonding Techniques and my dogs are finally under control. Thank you Jan Fennel and Monty Roberts! Keep up the good work!"
1,little value,"This book was disappointing at best. The actual informational content can be boiled down to 2 tips: eat a bite from your dog's bowl before you feed it, and don't pay attention to your dog right after you come home. The rest of the 300+ pages describes in nebulous descriptions how great the author is and how she solved dog problems by her mere presence and greatness. The author plows through multiple examples of dog problems and that they were solved, but without providing any details that are usable to the reader. The author boasts about getting her inspiration from a well known horse trainer. The author is a self-proclaimed equivalent in the dog training world. If she really possesses a talent, it is not apparent by reading this book. There are many good dog training books. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
5,It just makes sense!,"This is THE book for training your dog in my opinion. We have a very stubborn Beagle puppy who was showing many signs of thinking she was the alpha dog. After reading this book and applying the simple principles we have a changed dog! She is calm and responsive. We were at our wit's end and our obedience trainer recommended this book and it has been fabulous. I would recommend reading this book before you ever put a foot in a breeder's kennel. It will help you so much. It does work for older dogs too, so if nothing else has worked...try this book! This woman is a genius."
3,Dog Listener - good common sense,Down to earth advice with understandable examples of how to apply the authors ideas about dog-training. Easy to follow and easy to put into practice.
1,Bad Science,"Although her training techniques are loosely based on operant conditioning and positive training, Jan Fennell has little true knowledge of why and how this kind of training works. She also operates from the presumption that all bad behavior stems from dominance issues. This leads her to state some rather outrageous opinions as fact and to devise some very silly training exercise for things that can be accomplished much more easily."
5,A must-have book,What a great book. I'd go as far as saying it's a must-have for the true dog lover. I saw results in my dogs in just two days. Jan Fennell is an absolute genius of the doggy mind! I have read lots of books on dogs and this one is at the top of my list of recommendations for others.
5,The Dog Listener: Learn How to Communicate with Your Dog for Willing Communication,"The Dog Listener: Learn How to Communicate with Your Dog for Willing CooperationA friend in England recommended Jan to me and I found this book to far exceed my highest expectations. Ms. Fennell presents both scientific and practical information/advice in an easy to read/understand style. Applying her guidelines in training not only works, the resulting relationship between dog and companion is comfortable and stable for both. She is, however, very stern in admonishing the reader to realize her training method requires serious commitment and constancy from the human in the equation. But even folks who don't use it, will find the knowledge they acquire in reading the book will help them better understand the dogs in their lives."
5,Very Pleased,"We, and everyone else in our neighborhood, have a copy of this book. This purchase was to give our daughter a copy. It arrived without delay, and she is as delighted with the book as we are."
3,Helpful & Positive,It's ok but it took half the book to get to where the action is. I would've liked to read this book without so much personal story telling.
4,The Dog Listener,Kind of book that can be read with a comfortable feeling. This book directs me what to do with the unmanageable dog as well as why that works to dogs. It helps me a lot make my dog who was a stray dog be under control. Thanks to the author.
3,Good Points - Poor Writing,"The points covered by Ms. Fennell are excellent, but the way in which she presents them make this a difficult book to read. She uses too much verbage, and her examples are laboriously drawn out.."
1,disappointed,I was disappointed in the condition of the book. Last 50 or so pages were stained on edges and front cover was bent.
3,Got facts wrong,"The author makes numerous statements about wolf behavior that are simply incorrect. There are no citations in her work, but they appear to be based on studies on zoo wolves done in the 1950s. These studies contradict what has been observed in the wild.She does appear to support the notion of using positive rewards generally. This book is not a disaster, but there are numerous books out there that give better advice, books by folks like Karen Pryor, Ian Dunbar, and others."
4,Comfortability,"My husband wears, Polo-Shirts, for his job. I purchased this item from OuterBanks, with the Cotton Pique striped trim, variety of colors, and sizes, that suites.YES I recommend, this paricular, product."
1,Not Exact Item,"I asked for a 2nd edition of this book, unfortunately It was not and I lost my progress with my class"
3,"So-So, Not the greatest but not the worst memory book","This book delves into different aspects of memory and has some good suggestions like how to study. It also covers why we forget and classifies the types of memory. It also (too) briefly covers the mnemonic memory systems.However, if you want a good how-to on mnemonic memory systems I'd rather recommend Harry Lorayne's 'The Memory Book'If you want a book examining why, I would recommend Kenneth Higbee's 'Your Memory'Don't get me wrong, this book offers good advice and suggestions but it seems to be more of a jack-of-all-trades pulling in several different directions at once but not really being great at any one thing."
5,Total refers to more than memory techniques,"The best testimonial I can give for this book is that I read it three years ago and attribute ideas and associations I make everyday, directly and indirectly, to the diversity of content. Okay, it's written by a PHD but don't let that dimenish what you can get out of the book without being an academic type. I'm now searching Amazon for other memory books, really to learn about more about memory tricks and techniques, but I'm sure I'll continue to hold this book as the standard by which to judge the other memory books. It's much much more than tricks and techniques as it attempts to provide, as much as possible, the real meaning of human memory."
2,Not worth reading,"I was attracted by the title of this book. I expected this book to teach useful skills to maximize a person's memory power, as indicated by the book title. But in reality, the book touched very little on these topics and I learned very little from it. The book is talking a lot about experiments and other stuff."
2,6 months later it is still in the box.,"Couldn't get anyone to install it. Called 8 area shops local and national chains, and noone would install it for me :("
1,remote starter,way too much trouble. took 2 hrs to install and local shop would have done the job for 35.00 more think about this option before buying!
5,ill,Yo. This album is hot.They drop bombs and don't mess around.I can't believe more popel have not heard of this.When you want a band that just rips it up nice...Simply Saucer.It's the mad sweet old just ripping and going for it.No one wants to do that anymore...Well...Simply Saucer did.Buy it.
4,cher is cher,"i think this live cd this shows cher greatness she been around for 30 years she was around my mom,s time in the 60,s she had a talk show with the late sonny bono in the 70,s after a few flopping records in the late 60,s the 70,s made cher a star i think she did great job in the 70,s and 80,s in movies she rasied the bar the frist artist to change their image she did it frist. most these women idolize (janet jackson) models after her and MRS crow in the 90,s she start to slow down and come and go. and i would see her come and go cher in veagas now taking mrs Dion place thank you cher gloria estefan was the last preson to rasied the bar since cher and she fade out with her too . in 98"
4,A must have for Cher fans,"Cher has far too many ""great hits"" collections out there, but this is a must have, since it is an excellent live show. The opening track can give you chills; one of my favourites from the album. ""Take Me Home"" starts out with some brilliant instrumentals - soooo 70s disco! There is a bit too much of Cher talking in between tracks, some of which exposes her somewhat arrogant attitude a bit much, but I still love her. With less talk, they could have thrown in a couple more songs. The attitude is what makes some love her more, I suppose."
4,GOOD ENTERTAINMENT,"GOOD,GOOD,GOOD,GOOD,GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOOD, GOOD GOOD,GOOD,GOOD, GOOD, GOOD GOOD, GOOD, THIS IFS S TERRIBLE WAY TO CONDUCT A SURVEY BY FORCING 25 WORDS. I WILL NEVER DO THIS AGAIN."
4,Rhythmic But Rough,"The great material on this CD is spoiled, to some extent, by the abrupt stops between segments. It's not unlike someone slamming a door on one segment just before the next one begins. Apparently the recording engineers didn't understand the effectiveness of the fade controls."
5,IT~S FASCINATING,"Cher the real diva is leaving us but in return she made this very good live cd of her last tour on earth the fabouluosness as she calls it is a mixture of 18 of her favorite hits as is1.still havent found what im looking 42.song 4 the lonely3.all or nothing4.i found someone5.bang bang6.all i really wanna do7.half breed8.gypsies,tramps.and thieves9.dark lady10.take me home11.way of love12.after all13.like jesse james14.heart of stone15.shoop shoop song16.strongh enough17 if i could turn back time and her forever ANTHEM 18.BELIEVEITS FASCINATING BUY IT BEFORE THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!"
5,"IF NOT THE QUEEN , SHE'S A GODDES","I CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT THIS CD IS WORTH UP TO THE LAST MINUTE OF IT. CHER'S VOICE IS ALWAYS POWERFUL, HOUNTING AND HOPE-INSPIRATING.IT FEATURES SOME OF HER GREATEST HITS, AND SOME OF HER ALWAYS FUN MONOLOGUES. CHER KNOWS WHAT A LIVE SHOW MEANS, SHE ROCKS.CHER IS THE BEST FEMALE SINGER OF THE LAST TIMES, SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST ACTRESSES. WHAT ELSE CAN SHE ASK FOR? SHE IS A GRAMMY, EMMY, OSCAR, ETC ETC WINNER.CHER IS THE REAL AND ONLY DIVA OF WORLD MUSIC. (sorry Madonna)"
5,Great CD for serious and casual Cher fans,"This is not only a fine concert CD, but it's also a good retrospective of Cher's music career. You get the classics (""Dark Lady"", ""Half-Breed""), the '80s rock (""I Found Someone"") and the '90s dance comeback (""Believe"", ""Strong Enough"") plus some forgotten classics (""Heart of Stone"") making this almost an essential Cher CD.Cher's voice sounds great, and all the songs are worth listening straight through."
4,It's great to find organic decaf green tea!,I'm grateful to finally find a source of organic decaf green tea and I look forward to trying the other teas in this catalog. The organic mission of this company is really inspiring.
3,Fortran coloring book,"I feel embarrassed. After putting in a negative review for not receiving the shipment, it arrived the next day. It would have been nice to have received notice when the second shipment took place,but book arrived well packaged, and in excellent condition.I had a copy years ago, and wanted a new copy for when the kids I work with now come asking fortran questions. Book takes a somewhat different approach to teaching programming by providing real world analogies to explain programming concepts."
2,Too bad it really isn't a coloring book...,"Naive me, I thought this was a coloring book. What a great idea, I thought. Unfortunately ""A FORTRAN Coloring Book"" is actually a hand-written college textbook. In its defense, it is mildly humorous in spots and gives you a look back at life in the punch card days. I really wish it was a coloring book, though."
1,Tomolino 14 oz. Vacuum Amphi Mug,"I was so not pleased with this product. I had purchased a $5 mug from Wal Mart and thought this was slimilar. My cheap mug keeps my coffee hot for hours...this mug, which costs more, doesn't keep your drink warm for even 30 minutes! Even after setting the cup in scalding hot water prior to filling with your drink. What a waste of money!"
3,A Fine Tale ...Tall Too,"And that is exactly what it seems to be, i.e. a tale. It is quite an adventure, but it did not ring true to me. I found out later that Jones' biographer wrote of numerous instances where Tristan twisted the truth. Nonetheless it's fun to read, but I can only give it three stars. You can buy my copy at Bill's Books at the Amazon Marketplace and judge for yourselves."
3,With a large grain of salt,This is a wonderful story and one must read it as a story because the truth of the matter is Mr. Jones made up most of it.
2,Clear clear with Windows 98,"I'm running a Netgear network at home, all wireless, with the Netgear MR814 router and another Netgear MA401 PCMCIA wireless card. No problems with both. With the MA111, the story is a little different. Upon installing the configuration utility, it totally froze my machine. Nothing you can do about it. I had to re-boot in Safe mode, remove all of the drivers and utility, and upgrade to Windows 2000 to make it work. Not worth the effort."
2,Works for Tivo2...WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IT!,"I don't understand the other reviewer that gave this product five stars after having problems with the first one. I like my electronics to work the first time I use them. It works with Tivo for 5 to 30 minutes at a time until it randomly stops connecting to the network. The only fix is unplugging it and putting it back in. I did everything from upgrading my netgear router (which works great) firmware, to removing all security keys. Still the same problem. Tried installing it on my laptop and it kept restarting after a blue screen, maybe because I'm running XP SP2 like the other reviewer. I'm going to return mine promptly and spend a few extra bucks to get the Linksys WUSB11 instead."
2,horrible experience with installation,"the software that comes with it is horrible. Its not windows XP certified and has lot of problems in its performance. i had to install it several times and was puzzled since it used to drop the connection every now and then. finally i had to install it with configuring it to use the windows XP wireless protocol and so far its working fine. its only a day since i have got the adapter and already had to reboot my desktop, router, cable modem atleast 10 times. total crapy software/device."
4,Works Great for the Price,You can't beat this for the price. Be sure to update the driver or you might run into problems. When I first installed the adapter I had to restart my computer 2 to 3 times for it to be detected. After I updated the driver I have not had a problem since. I only use it over small distances (around 30 feet) so not sure how it works for larger distances. Either way if you want something cheap that works buy it.
1,Hated it!,"I had nothing but problems with this product. It ""claims"" to be compatible with windows 95, 98, 2000, ME and XP, but all that it works for in reality is Windows ME. I had one hell of a time trying to get it to work with my computers at home, with bascially no success. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,I HATE this piece of crap,I bought this for my sister's computer a year ago and it has been nothing but trouble since I've supported it.I'm thinking I'll smash it with a hammer and send it back to Netgear with a 'thank you' note as gratitude for them wasting so many hours of my life trying to get their worthless drivers to work. I might have been able to cure cancer or build the perfect hydrogen creation system and resolve the world's energy crisis. Instead I was tearing out my already thinning hair and praying to every diety I could remember that this thing would pick up an IP address and keep it.Once I'd get the adapter going you couldn't get near the adapter because if it lost its connection it might never get it back.If you're thinking about buying this card do yourself a favor and buy a gun instead. Suicide would be more rewarding than owning this intolerable piece of crap.I'm sure if I could find the words to capture how I feel about this adapter and its drivers Amazon would censor them.
1,Avoid this product!!!,"It is the worst computer product I ever tried.Blue screen/reboot my laptop repeatly when usingthe software (either version 1.1 or 2.0) from netgear.When the driver from WinXP is used, can only workfor less than 2 minutes.I would never buy any product from netgear."
3,"Good speed, WEP unusable","I know have the adapter working. After several hours of attempting to configure WEP (encryption), I gave up and am know using the Access Control feature of my Netgear MR814V2 router. This limits access to the router by MAC address (computer ID).Speed is good to very good."
1,Caused PC to reboot,I'm running WIndows XP service pack 1 on a Compaq desktop. It was a very reliable machine until installing this wireless USB adapter.My machine rebooted every time I had this installed. I downloaded the latest driver and this still did not fix the problem. I called there tech support and after waiting for 15 minutes for a tech I decided my cell phone minutes were too valuable and my time would be better spent returning it.
1,Crashed my computer. Cannot reboot. Cannot even reinstall windows.,"Installing this product on my rather new XP machine has led to the hardest crash I have ever experienced on a computer. Not only can I not boot to safe mode or boot to last good setting, but when I try to reinstall windows, the reinstall hangs every time.My plan is to pull the hard drives, reformat them on a different computer, plug them back in and try again - with all data lost of course.Stay away from this product!"
2,Blue screens Win XP,"I've used this adapter on three different PC's and it bluescreens XP once or twice per day on average. I've uninstalled/re-installed, and updated drivers on the XP machines with no improvement.Windows 2000 works OK. General wireless performance is in line with the other PCMCIA based 802.11 cards I've used."
4,MA111v2 not TiVo compatible,"Just as a warning, Amazon.com is now shipping v2 of the MA111 adapter. Only the original version 1 is currently supported by TiVo, so do not purchase this if you want wireless connectivity with your Series2 box. See tivo.com/adapters for the latest list. The product box will list ""MA111v2"" if you have the newest version."
2,After The Crew Have Become Tired And Weary,"I agree with the electronics fan from Washington,DC.Despite the manufacturer's literature, this device does not always work well with Windows 98. I was installing this on an older computer which will be used in a classroom. After hours of updating drivers and installing updates it only works occasionally. With that being said I did try it out on my laptop and desktop which runs XP and it ran fine. Windows 98 users should REALLY think before buying this device or update your OS to XP."
1,Crashed my computer,"I bought this product thinking that it would be the best choice in connecting to my Netgear router, but I was very wrong. Every time I tried to install the adapter, it would cause my computer to crash. I tried 3 different times and every time I got the same result. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I wish I had listened to other reviewers before trying it. It is a waste of money. I ended up getting a Linksys adapter instead and now everything is working fine. If you value your money and your computer stay as far away from this product as possible!"
1,Constantly Dropping Signal,"This product works 80% of the time, and has great reception, but drops the signal often enough that I am forced to get a new product. Ugh."
2,Overheats Regularly,"I was able to get a v1 which DOES work with my TiVo, but this adapter overheats like clockwork, and shuts down. To get a connection I need to unplug it, let it cool, and force a reconnect. This is very annoying, and I don't reccomend you buy this if you don't want to have to update your TiVo manually. That said, when it IS running, it works fine."
3,Harder than it should be.,"i should have give this item more stars, but since it was so hard configuring it i will only give 3 stars.Successful instalation steps:1. Download and install the version 2.0 of the drivers for this device from netgear.com, dont use the ones that come in the box most probably is they are an older version and will not work fine.2. Go to windows services and disable Wireless Zero Configuration, if you try to do it from the wireless network property window as stated on the user manual it probably wont work.after doing those 2 things i could succesfuly make the device work properly.of course getting that knowledge consumes me like 2 days of internet searching for solutions on MA111 v1 configuration problems."
3,You Get What You Pay For,I am using this product with Windows XP Home Edition. You should read some of the troubleshooting tips on Netgear's web page before you install this. You will need to unistall an update that you might have installed through Windows Update. Once uninstalled it will stop crashing Windows when it connects. The reception is about what you would expect from something this small. It comes with a USB extension so you can move it around to get a better signal.
4,"After an initial disappointment, I am loving this adapter...","This purchase was my first attempt with wireless, and what you've read hear is true--it blue screened my IBM Thinkpad 600 laptop running WindowsXP, crashed it and restarted it repeatedly. It caused even more unpleasantries when I installed it on a desktop I built that is running Windows98SE. However, once I downloaded the driver, version 2.0 off Netgear's website, all was well and fixed, for the most part. The CD came with Version 1.1, which seemed to be causing all the problems. Anyway, after I installed the new version and draped the adapter out my window, I was surfing the net."
4,Works on Dell Inspiron/XP,After I installed this adapter on my Dell Inspiron 5100 it didn't work at first. After reading Timothy Jackson's review I decided to try the newest Synaptics driver even though I didn't encounter the exact same problem as he did. Voila! It works after I upgraded my Synaptics driver v7.6.4. And I'm submitting this review via MA111 right at this moment.
5,"Tiny, elegant, simple to install","This little wireless adapter installed easily on my Windows ME notebook (no small feat, as practically nothing else installs simply on WinME machines). The installation instructions said I would have to change some setting during install, but it autosensed everything and I was up and running in less than 10 min. Excellent signal from basement to second floor Linksys WAP (about 20 vertical feet, two floors). My only minor issue is that the adapter sticks out in a rather precarious location from the back of the notebook. Could easily be damaged if you pick up the notebook carelessly or move around alot. In that case, a PC card adapter may make more sense for your applications."
4,Decent USB Adapter for Money,"The MA111 works pretty well most of the time. As long as you get version 2.0 of the drivers from Netgear's website, it works well in Win XP Pro. Also - I got it working with my Mac PowerBook G4. I found some instructions on how to modify D-Link's OS X drivers to work with the MA111, and it works great!My only complaints - gets very warm. When I plugged it into my HP running Win 2000 Pro, it shut down my PC. Literally. Just all shut off as if the power had been pulled. It might be my PC though, I don't want to be quick to blame Netgear. Last complaint, is that the speed is usually at 2 Mbps, not 11. However, it goes to 11 when I am using it to transmit data, so I am not sure 2 Mbps is just a mode it goes to when doing nothing."
2,Does not work with Linux.,"The product information makes no distinction between the old ""v1"" of the product and the new ""v2"" which is shipped by Amazon.The new version uses an entirely different set of drivers, and will not yet work with Linux.I was extremely disappointed to receive this as a gift, only to find that the new version will not work with my laptop system, while the older version could have done the job quite easily."
1,Doesn't work as promised,"I installed the CD, and I couldn't get the wireless connection to happen at all, much less have problems after it. It also doesn't help when the documentation just assumes you'll be connected right away. It didn't happen. I'm still not connected.I tried configuration without the CD. Windows configuration is total junk. 2.0 MBPS and pretty much can't get half-descent signal.It's a shame this ""reputable"" company produced something like this. I've had experience with generic brands that just outperform this thing. Easily. No contest. They work great and are easy to setup. This is like....doesn't work."
1,Unstable - the worst piece of hardware I have,I experienced what many users here also experienced. My MA111 is a pain in the back. Bought it after better experience with a MA101 but could not buy another MA101 - so I bought the first available one from my local store without looking at reviews. What a mistake!First my Win XP machine started rebooting time after time. After I upgraded the driver of the MA111 from 1.1 to 2.0 the machine is no longer crashing uncontrolled but I get breakdowns of the wireless conection by the dozen a working day. Intollerable! I did not buy mine at amazon - so I cannot return it for a refund.
1,Hello XP Service Pack 2 - Good Bye MA111,"Here is another occasion when I feel like an idiot for not spending an extra $9 for the Linksys adapter. The Netgear USB adapter sucks. Upgraded to SP2, it won't work anymore - and I don't have any touchpads (as indicated by another reviewer). No more Netgear for me!"
2,Caution,"I too have had trouble with this device in Windows XP Home. It crashed my computer multiple times (and I have a nice newish computer with plenty of memory). Eventually i had to reinstall windows and upgrade to XP professional. It's worked well since then, no computer crashes. HOWEVER, After 6 months of use it's connection has worn. It is wobbly and has to be adjusted just so before it will give the green light. I'm looking to replace it. I bought the NEt gear router as a set at Costco. The router seems fine, but I will be moving to a PCMCIA style Wireless card in future. Just not sturdy enough!"
3,"A pain, but it works.","I have three different types of wireless adapters - two by Linksys and this one by Netgear. None of them are perfect and this one was a pain to install mainly because it somehow needs to override Windows (XP) wireless settings and it's not always successful. Signal-wise, it works well for me but I attribute that to the Linksys booster for their wireless router which we use. It has made a huge improvement with all of these devices.Note that by default it is set up to find any open wireless connections. You might want to configure it for your home network only if that is the only place you use it."
1,"Really ""The Last Stop...""","Why was this book written in the first place? Why was it reprinted at all? Thank God I did not buy it, just read it - and am sorry I wasted all this time on a well-written piece of garbage.Geli Raubal might not have died a virgin, but she certainly was not the tramp Nagorski made her out to be. Having been a victim of exactly the time period which the ""writer"" expounds on, I have long ago stuck my nose in just about every publicaton I could read that was pertinent to the subject of Hitler . The flights of phantasy the author takes are so way out it makes you wonder what he was thinking (if at all) when he made up the story.He has written such excellent, serious books and now this.....How could he deteriorate into this garbage dump? Waste not (your money), and it is not worth reading seiously - except for a few excellent description of sexual encounters. Your choice -- not mine."
3,"INTERESTING, BUT NOT THRILLING","If the author had dropped his idea of writing a ""what if this had happened"" novel and simply published a work of history, this would have been a better book. The historical information is great and the descriptions of places in 1920s Germany are splendid. Mr. Nagorski is a fine writer. He just isn't a very good novelist. There isn't a lot of dialogue in ""Last Stop Vienna"" and what is there does not ring true. (Putting words into the mouth of a monster such as Adolph Hitler requires incredible novelistic ability to make those words believable.)The fights between storm troopers and their opponents have no sting to them. Again, it is as if you are reading a dry work of history. Mr. Nagorski creates some interesting characters, and he has an interesting plot line. He just wasn't able to bring the people or the story to life."
3,Disappointing,"Nagorski is probably an excellent journalist. He can write, but his characterization and plotting aren't up to snuff here. The protagonist (I hesitate to use the word ""hero"" in this case.) is a young man who learns absolutely nothing in the nearly 300 pages of this book. He begins as an angry, irresponsible teenager who deserts his widowed mother in the aftermath of the first World War, and he ends as a prisoner who comes to hate the man (Hitler) he once worshipped, but still shares Hitler's values and beliefs. Perhaps this would have worked in a book about private people, but once you involve a public figure like Hitler, the story you're telling will grow to fit the myth that surrounds that figure.I think referring to this novel as an alternate history is perhaps misleading. The event which makes it so occurs at the very end of the novel, and we're never really given any indication of how the event changes history as we know it. And that too, is a disappointment."
5,Nagorski's a born novelist!,"One of the most interesting, fascinating and brilliant historical novels I've ever read. Creating a fictional character who acts as the reader's lens into a past world is extremely tricky and difficult--and Nagorski wrote it all so smoothly and seemingly effortlessly. It was more than a pleasure to read. It also made me reflect on the situations today: what if things had been slightly different in the past, what if things were taken care of today in a slightly altered manner...What would this world be like now? It's a shame Karl Naumann didn't exist-and that such a perverse monster named Hitler was even allowed to live as long as he did. Absolutely brilliant. I can't wait for what Nagorski's next subject will be...he's truly gifted."
4,New & Refreshing Sound,"It is a pleasant thing to see some old school and new school artist collaborate on a project. Not only is it enjoyable for me, I can share it with my younger siblings. This is a great way to start bridging the age gap!"
4,sweet,"delicious but very sweet. If you are just looking for a suttle flavor of maple this is not it. Altough the tea in itself is strong, which counters the sweetness, I would still say that it's very sweet."
4,Glass more than half full,"It was difficult for me not to give this CD 5 stars. It does not quite measure up to my favorite Phillip Glass compositions, but nevertheless I listen to Symphony No 2 often.There are three works on this recording; Symphony No. 2, Interlude from Orphee, and Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra. It is the namesake Symphony which is the jewel of this collection. It is typical of Glass' best work. A simple theme is repeated, varied, and experimented with. The result is hauntingly powerful. The theme's beauty holds the piece together.The other pieces are not as good, but still enjoyable listening. If like I, you are a Glass fan, you will like this CD. If you are considering which Phillip Glass composition might be a good introduction, I would recommend his soundtrack to the movie ""Kundun"" or the ""Heroes Symphony."""
1,Poor quality,The red wire from the two 9-volt battery power supply was disconnected upon product arrival. Unfortunately there was no way to get at the downstream connection to solder it without breaking the thing apart. Cheap quality all around. Don't waste youy money!
2,"Terrible, High setting is hardly warm!","Should have heeded all the reviews that say that this pad doesn't get hot enough. The highest setting is barely warm. Also, the microfiber/polyester is quite scratchy and full of static. This is definitely going back to Amazon."
3,Stopped working,"It worked great for the first few months and really helped with my back pain, but it just stopped working one day."
2,poor heat,"waste of my money, it is not hot enough for anything! nerver buy it again i wish i can return it if i buy in a store. forever no heat i can call."
1,Misrepresented Product,Model 816 does NOT have a provision for adding water for moist heat as stated in the description and as represented in the photo. This is an ordinary dry heating pad with no special features that haven't been around for decades.
2,Worked great... up until it stopped working,"I purchased this product in January of 2008, and used it for the remainder of last winter. It worked well for lower and upper back pain caused by cold weather, and the three heat settings were nice to be able to customize the heat. However, this winter, it simply stopped working. The ""high heat"" light flashed on and off (as it does when it auto-shut off after two hours), and unplugging/plugging it back in did not fix the issue. Removing the cord, and re-inserting it did not fix the issue. My guess is there is something wrong in the wiring that is sending a signal that the unit is overheated and has forced an automatic shutoff. While it was a good heating pad, it only worked for 3-4 months before breaking. I'll be looking for a non-Sunbeam brand to replace this, as this was the second Sunbeam heating pad I've had that stopped working for no reason."
4,Very flexible,"got this product to us around my neck. The wires are very thin and the pad twists enough to wrap around my neck and shoulders. wish you could over-ride the 2 hour shutoff, but that is a minor annoyance."
2,Great design but NO heat,The soft flexible design of the heating pad is exactly what I was looking for! It incredibly comfortable.unfortunatly the pad just does not get hot enough to give any pain relief which is ultimatly the most important benefit of this product - I will have to go back to the terrible plastic cheapo heating pad I was using.
1,Bad odor,The pad was as described with the exception of the chemical odor which the pad gave off. I had to return the pad as the odor was too strong.
2,Works great when it works,"Have purchased 3 Sunbeam heating pads. They work great until the red light starts flashing and it stops working. Followed instructions from ""customer service"" to unplug to reset but it still does not work. The ""non-human"" customer service recommended I take it to my nearest service center over 200 miles away. This seems to be a continuing problem with all Sunbeam heating pads. Will be looking for another brand."
5,So far so good,"I bought this heating pad a few months ago and no complaints so far. The cord is long enough to allow having the pad quite far from the outlet. I read that it doesn't heat well even on the highest setting. However, I find it too hot sometimes and have to go to a lower setting, especially if I have it with me in bed under the blanket. The control is convenient and can be operated even in the dark because of the little lights. As for the 2 hour shut off, it is great. I do not have to worry about forgetting to turn it off. By the time it is off I am soundly asleep. And I can wash it in the washing machine! It is a steal for this amount!"
1,3 months=broken heating pad,I actually really liked this heating pad with it's auto shut off and hourglass size until it broke just shy of 3 months. :(
1,Heating pad that didn't work,I bought a heating pad at Amazon and when I plugged it init didn't work . I sent it back and asked for them tosend me one that did work and instead they refundedmy money. So I went locally and bought a heating padthat works. I was very disappointed in the way thiswas handled.Mrs. Olga Fox
2,Not worth the $,"I bought this about 4 or 5 months ago. When I first got it, it worked fairly well on the lowest setting. Although with in days the heat seemed to fluctuate from warm to less warm. That problem has only gotten worse with use. I now use the medium to high settings trying to maintain a constant heat. Also, occasionally it won't turn on.. it's red light just blinks. I then have to unplug and re-plug in device to get it to work. It's not worth the money and I am currently looking for something better!"
3,Great Construction limited heat output,"Well constructed and love the soft, no slip, one-piece cover; however, the heat output is not even close to my old heating pads with the removable covers that bunch up, fall off ,etc. if the heat output was more in line with the older, cheaper ones, I would give it a five. I don't like the auto off timer, but that may be a federal regulation now."
4,Very Pleased,Very satified with how fast I received this product. Heats up fast and very soft. Use it everyday.Will buy it again.
3,HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is to HOT!!! Even on 'warm', it is to hot. I would recommend youbuy something else. Maybe with a slidable switch? I still haven't figuredout 'auto off' light, as it never comes on."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"What a waste of money! I was happy when the pad arrived because I liked the extra soft cover. I used it about 6 times and it started flashing the ""hot"" light. I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, selecting the low heat. After 5 seconds the ""hot"" light starts flashing again. When we called Sunbeam, they said I must have used the pad incorrectly: Apparently you can't lie on it on lean against anything. ""One side of the pad must have air the entire time."" The fact that I never lay on it, but placed it on top of a shoulder seemed to have no affect with the rude service lady. If I had known that it was so fragile AND that Sunbeam wouldn't replace a defective product, I would have never wasted my money. I'll buy another brand next time."
2,Sunbeam is not like it used to be.,This hot pad worked for 2 weeks..now I have to reset it about every 10 minutes because it does not stay heated.I would not buy one of these again.
4,"The late, great, awesome Hiram","If you're a guitar player, you really should get all of Hiram's albums. But if you just want to listen, I prefer it when he didn't sing. Its not that he had a bad voice; its just that somehow (for me) it didn't add anything and it was always ""Girl, you're gonna learn your lesson...""But he was a stunningly cool, unique, funky guitar player. The instrumentals on From All Sides, Give It What U Got and Guitar Man are timeless. He was, indeed, way cool."
3,Disappointing,"A reasonably good introduction, but not up to the standards of other books in the series. Somewhat amateurish and self-indulgent."
4,What is a Science?,"This book represents really very, very short introduction to the Philosophy of Science. Anyone who is beginner in this field should read this text as it really will help in acquiring basic insights about the most important debates within the history and philosophy of Science. As for me, of the particular interest were the issues of theory construction, hypothesis testing and assessing progress within the scientific fields. Most interesting points are made when discussing the issues of falsificationism and theory construction. Also the book discusses in great details Thomas Kuhn and his contribution to the History and Philosophy of Science.Overall this book is worth reading . . ."
3,A series of small facts that obscure the big picture,"Charles MacDonald writes a wonderful account from the perspective of the individual soldier. Through his many, many examples, however, he tends to cloud the general picture of the battle. For example, in one skirmish he focuses on a single platoon of soldiers holding a particular ridge. The soldiers are valiant, hold the Germans longer than any unit of this size has any right to, and then retreat. Several pages later you discover that about 3000 American men died in this battle, and that the 50 or so men that had been focused on for the last several pages were only a fraction of those involved. To put it another way, MacDonald's sense of scale seemed completely inappropriate, and the actions of a few came across as important as the actions of many."
2,Hard to follow.,It was a little hard to follow the flow of the battle in this account. I had trouble seeing the overall picture. The maps were vague and difficult to interpret. The best chapters were on the personality conflicts between Eisenhower and Montgomery. The personal stories by individuals involved in the battle were also very interesting. I got lost in the many details of unit movements and who was where and who commanded who. More and better detailed maps would have been helpful.
2,"Too, too much","Look, the gent means well but unless you were at that battle or studying at an academy to go into a battle like it (where we don't know in 2010), this book is not for you.Missing for any reader is anything approaching a sense of how all these units came together in relationship to one another. Page after page of facts about this commander and that unit is nice but how did they all come together to create the battle. Tell me alot more of the latter and much less of the former. To understand the bulge in a tomb like this one needs computer graphics keeping the uniatiated reader up to date with who is crossing this creek and where that puppy runs in relationship to the broader scheme.Nice try, no cigar."
5,A Time for Trumpets: The Untold Story of the Battle of the Bulge,"I purchased this book for my wife's Grandfather who was there, at The Battle of the Bulge, as a gift. He has said it was a very well written book with a factual account of the battle as he remembers it with a few minor events that he remembered differently, but it was almost 70 years ago. He enjoyed reading it!"
5,All You Ever Wanted To Know,If you are new to the WWII arena this book without a doubt is one of the best on the subject written by an Infantry Captain who was there and went on to become the historian of that theater. Well researched and written this is a must have if you are into this sort of thing. A large book and a definite 'must' in any WWII's buffs library. Highly reccomend.
3,Exhaustive...but exhausting,"Granted, in ""A Time for Trumpets"" the late Charles MacDonald provides a comprehensive account of the battle. But he focuses far too much on troop movements (as opposed to the troops themselves) for my taste. The book starts off well with a look into the tactical minds of Adolf Hitler and his generals, but then the narrative turns into a bland procession of unit names and their geographic locations. Poor-quality maps offer little help to the reader dutifully trying to note each of these places. When the shooting starts, there are a few refreshing stories from the soldier's point of view, but these are quickly crushed under the weight of countless unit movements. Although this may be fascinating to a military scientist, the casual reader hoping to learn the thoughts and feelings of common soldiers at the Bulge will be sorely disappointed."
5,Great Deal,The price was the best I have ever found on these batteries and they work great.. very pleased.
5,Charlie now listens to me!,"My three year old Shihtzu male comes most of the time when called. You noticed I said ""most"". Sometimes he just doesnt't want to so he runs the other way when I call him. It only took three days for him to change his mind about coming! Great product. This was my first purchase from Amazon but it won't be my last...they made it easy."
5,Pet safe batteries came fast work great,This item came fast and works great. These are great for all my dogs collars and no problems so far. They work just fine.
1,Wrong batteries,I ordered the pet tag inexpensive no bark collar and Amazon paired these batteries with the product. They werre the incorrect batteries. The product actually requires an LR44. 1.5 V button battery (#3)
3,they work,"I use these batteries for my dogs radio collar, I haven't had any problems out the batteries themselves but I wish they would last a bit longer, I change them about every two months which isn't bad but wish it was longer. I recommend them."
1,Does not stop dog from barking,It just vibrated on the dogs neck. Neither one could care less and still barked. They still barked as much as they did
1,Arrived nearly dead,"These were close to useless. On installation, the light flashed indicating low battery. I got a couple of hours use out of each battery and then they were truly dead. Useless regardless of the price."
3,Special size pet safe battery?!?,"Petsafe Has quite a racket going on, making their own special batteries. I have found the charge in these batteries to be inconsistent, with some batteries lasting months, and some lasting weeks.There are generic versions of these batteries for sale, which are significantly cheaper. I've ordered some of the cheaper batteries, but haven't used them yet as I'm still using the last of these Petsafe brand batteries. Hopefully the cheaper ones work as well or better."
5,These are not for the cat collars.,I bought these as a bundle with a cat fence transmitter and collar and these were not the correct size batteries for the cat collars. They were much larger. Possibly for the dog collars??? You will want to make sure to buy the correct size batteries when buying the cat collars.
2,Not need batteries,I need to read the product information. This was recommended but the product I bought did not use these batteries.
2,"Not sure why, but the battery died within 2 weeks",I feel that the batteries may have been old or expiring. They were on my dog for 3 weeks and went dead. They dog never even went near the shock zone.Its unfortunate...for me as they are expensive.
2,Some bum batteries,"I would say out of the 4 packs I bought and using more than half, its a 50/50 chance the battery is no good. Next time I will save all bad batteries out of the box and return them. This is no acceptable for lithum batteries, more so for those that are specially overmolded and very expensive."
1,wrong,"These batteries were ""recommended"" by Amazon when we purchased a bark collar and they weren't even close to the correct ones."
1,Wrong Batteries,"Although Amazon features these batteries with the SD-105 trainer, these are NOT the batteries that go with that trainer. Be sure that you purchase the right batteries for your collar."
1,Policy prevents justice from being served,"These batteries arrived to me dead. Neither from the pack work. I see that several people have had the same problem. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!! Amazon's policy of no returns on batteries means you are out of luck! Total waste of my money! I even paid for rush shipping, so I am out even more. Lowes and Home Depot carry these batteries. The ones I bought from Lowes worked perfectly."
3,What's the deal with the module pack,I have purchased previous PetSafe products in the past that used over the counter batteries. My most recent collar purchase uses a 'custom' module for the battery which is significantly more expensive than over the counter batteries.... What's the deal PetSafe? I guess it ensures we will be buying only PetSafe batteries for the collars......
3,Needlessly expensive design,"Amazon had the best prices I found , particularly with free shipping when buying enough to get over the $25 threshold . Don't know how they made money because each package of 2 batteries was shipped separately .But Petsafe seems to believe in milking the customers for unnecessarily expensive proprietary modules embedding the batteries in the waterproof cap and O ring .I understand newer models from competitors are now available with rechargeable batteries and in fact greater range . I'd shop for them before getting collared ;) by the Petsafe system again ."
3,dog collar,"This item worked when I had a big dog but it doesn't seem to be working with puppies. I had 1 collar already, your brand but a few yrs old and the new one of yours does not work as well as the old one."
5,Good Price,I picked these up on Amazon because they were the cheapest around. I got a two pack for a little over $5 shipped. Great deal for me as my local stores wanted $12.
4,Petsafe RFA-67D Batteries,So far these batteries are working great. I have had no issues with them whatsoever.
1,don't order with other items,don't waste your money ordering this with other items. Amazon charged me for the item but didn't put it in the package. Still trying to have it resent or credited.
1,do not buy - unreturnable and completely dead on arrival,"Dd not buy - when received batteries were completely dead - Amazon ""Returns"" stated they were non returnable because made of hazardous material - this was not stated anywhere on purchase page - the more I deal with Amazon the less I like them - they're kind of bullylike and it's always their way or the highway -"
2,Dead battery,"Batteries came today, one package both batteries are dead, the other package both are good but for how long?"
2,didn't work!,"Okay, we had a doggie door already in place at the house we bought so why not get a dog? We're a family with 3 small children and what could round us out more? What we didn't realize was that the sneaky neighbor cat liked to use the ""doggie door"" on cold January nights. So, we purchase an electronic doggie door to keep said ""sneaky neighbor cat"" OUT! We install it and realize that the door wasn't working properly. We called customer service and they sent us a replacement door with very few questions asked. Installed the new door and for some reason the door doesn't like to unlock until the ""key"" is RIGHT NEXT TO THE DOOR and even then, it has to be positioned a certain way to work. I don't know if the batteries were old or not. Now, we just manually lock the door at night and hope to rememeber to unlock it in the morning."
1,Disappointed in conflicting recommendation,"I have no idea of the quality of this product, but I am greatly disappointed that it was ""recommended"" by Amazon. I purchased bark collars that had nothing to do with this product. Disappointing, and this product is on its way back to you."
3,A battery,"Not sure whether they are fresher at Lowes or not. This is just a battery folks, nothing else. Arf Arf"
1,1st battery dead,Less than a week and the 1st battery is dead. And the dog isn't a heavy barker-- so it's not the dog's fault.
2,Weak Charge,Both batteries died within 3 days. Battery that shipped with collar lasted over one month. I don't know where the best source is to get these.
2,Only Comes With 2 Batteries-Not 4 like Description Says,"This purchase only included 2 of the batteries. The item description said it came with 4, so I was displeased when they came and only had 2. Product is fine, but advertising is false."
5,Make sure these are the right batteries!,"I have no problem with these batteries. They were well-packaged and arrived quickly. However, Amazon suggested that I purchase them to go with the dog collar I was buying, and they are the wrong size for the collar. So, just as a precaution, be sure to verify that these batteries will fit the appliance you have...don't take Amazon's suggestion as truth!"
2,Wroñg battery,I purchased this as combo that you suggested and it is not even the correct battery for the bark collar I purchased. I knew There was a reason I have never purchased item you recommend to buy with items purchased.
2,Batterys,"It showed that these battery's went to the shock collar I bought, but they do not. So I have batteries that I have no use for. Is there a way to send them back for a refund. I've never had to return anything I bought from Amazon."
2,Second battery died in the packaging...,"I love my PetSafe invisible fence system, and the collar works perfectly. I ordered these batteries at the end of July and the first battery has lasted until the beginning of December, so a litte over four months - not bad. However, when I put the second battery in the collar today, the red light still flashes indicating a dead battery. Very disappointing."
2,One battery didn't last more than 10 days,"I always buy these batteries from a local pet supply store but purchased on Amazon since I use Amazon weekly and the batteries were cheaper, but we have already had to change the first battery. Previous batteries have lasted at least a 1-2 months, so I am disappointed and will not buy online any more. We will see how long this other battery lasts."
1,Battery,Wrong size battery.- does not fit in the battery recepticle. Very obvious mistake. Supplied batteries arthin and round and needed batteries are long and thick.
1,Buy them somewhere else!,"I read reviews about the batteries being dead or near dead and figured that was bound too happen sometimes, so even after the first time the battery life was poor, I went and bought more cause, darn it is convenient to get them from Amazon.My dog ran off when wearing a collar with dead batteries and now he is dead, killed by a car. Certainly I don't think their worth the price."
3,Not suited for my dog,I guess that this product is ok. I never could get my pet to be controled by it. He was able to go through the fence on many ocassions.
1,don't even need this,this was put together with the bark collar i purchased for my dog; the collar is rechargeable and i was thinking these were for replacing the batteries since they are sold together. these will not fit in the collar and were a complete waste of money.
1,Batteries dead on arrival,"I purchased this item and thought it was great. However, when I put the batteries in the dogs collar they were dead within 1/2 hour. I would like to find out how to get my money back!"
1,Did not hold enough charge,"I bought these batteries to go for the PetSafe bark collar as suggested by several reviews that said the battery the collar ships with does not hold enough charge. When we got the collar it didn't work, so I ordered these hoping to solve the problem.No such luck.I put the new battery in but there was no change in performance on the collar. Now I have a useless collar with several batteries that I have no use for.Save your money and avoid the PetSafe brand."
1,Battery didn't fit,"I purchased this at the same time I purchased the Pet Tag Classic No Bark Collar, Red, Small. These items were shown together, leading me to believe the batteries would work in the collar. Nope - wrong size. Unopened package sitting there, staring at me."
2,cheep,These batteries only last about a week or two depending on if you use them alot or alittle. The package info says they will only last two weeks. I wish I would have known that before I purchased them. I will try another retailer to see if I get longer life.
3,"Batteries Good, Short Life",These batteries are as expected and even saves you a few dollars from the local hardware store that carries these. I wish the battery life was longer because I go through 8 or more a year. Good product and does as advertised.
3,good price - but haven't tried them yet,appears to work as expected - excellent retailerThis should have been standard batteries. Petsafe doesn't need to make any more money but selling batteries that have no real advantage over standard watch batteries. Of course you can't use standard batteries on this model so this is as good as it gets. They are at lease 50% less expensive as the same batteries from home depot where I bought the electronic fence.
3,Easy to use,This style battery is super easy to change on my dogs collar. Unfortunately they only last about a month each and my dogs rarely test their boundries. I wish I could find another brand to try to make a comparison but this is the only one like it I've found. Gotta have them so I keep buying them.
1,Poorest battery life of any product I've ever used,"Ordered 12 batteries 2 weeks ago. Four came out of the packages completely dead. Two worked for 2 days before they started maniacally beeping, which made my poor dogs run frantically around the apartment while I tried to capture them to remove their collars. If you are considering purchasing these, save your money and your dog's sanity: buy from another supplier."
1,Short Lived,Service and delivery were exceptional as always. The life of the first battery was less than one month nearly 3 months shorter than the battery that came with the collar when it was purchased in early August. Very disappointing and just another reason why products with custom power supplies should be avoided.
5,Perfect,These work great and fit my dog's bark collar perfectly. The item shipped quickly and was received quickly. Will definitely order again.
1,Both Batteries Dead,You are better off purchasing these batteries from a retailer. Do not buy from this retailer. Both batteries were dead out of the package. I am very disappointed.
5,Review of batteries,These batteries are exactly what I needed to keep my dogs within range of the Petsafe monitor. I am very happy with the batteries and the price.
1,THESE DON'T LAST!,STUCK W THESE AFTER BUYING A PET SAFE BARK COLLAR THAT DOESN'T STOP MY LITTLE DOG FROM BARKING. THESE R SUPPOSED TO LAST 6 MONTHS - YOU'RE LUCKY IF U GET 2 MONTHS! I'M NOT BUYING ANYMORE PET SAFE PRODUCTS!
4,Work well,these fit the product descibed and wrok well. remember to turn off the collar at night or when not in use.
3,Weak battery,"I like the simplicity of the battery , but it runs down too quickly, and there is no way to know that it needs changing."
1,didnt order these they charged me and wont let me return them,"Don't buy from them, they wont let you return because the batteries are hazardous but they can ship them with out a hazardous label wonder if the post office knows about this."
3,A necessary evil,"Shame on Pet Safe for devising a ""proprietary"" battery. It's a watch battery glued (very firmly) into a plastic holding piece. They make my dog's bark collar work, but I knocked one star off for the sneaky, money-grubbing design and one star for the duration of use. They certainly don't last as long as they should for something they overcharge for."
1,Arrived Dead,"Like others have noted, these batteries arrived completely dead/unusable. They seem to have a finite shelf life and the lot that Amazon is giving people is apparently past that.Buy them from somewhere else."
1,Dead on arrival,"These batteries have so much problems.Both batteries in the package did not generate any juice, period.I rarely write any reviews but I had no choice for this one."
1,advertised with petsafe collar doesnt fit it,These batteries were advertised with the petsafe collar but when i tried to put them in they were not able to fit i hate them
1,would have been great if the collar I bought them for had worked!!!,These batteries would have been good had they been attached to a useful product!! The collar just plane was a piece of GARBAGE I sent it back and the batteries went in the trash cause it was already a huge pain to sent the collar back so I just said forget the 10 buck we'll call this a learning experience. WOULD GITVE IT A NO STAR IF I COULD!!
1,Poor quality control - Dead batteries every time!,"I have ordered these batteries from Amazon twice. They arrived nearly dead both times. By ""nearly dead"", I mean that they worked for 3-5 days before dying completely.I have also purchased them in the store (Home Depot and Petsmart) with varied results. Sometimes they are fully charged and work for 3-6 months; other times, I get only a few days or weeks. This is a huge problem since stores are reluctant to allow you to return batteries.In addition to failing to address the quality control issue, PetSafe does nothing to help you avoid buying expired batteries. There is no date on the package and no stated shelf life. This means that the stores have no way of knowing when the product has gone bad, and the consumer has no way of knowing if they're buying a defective/expired product that they won't be able to return."
5,These batteries worked really well,I bought these replacement batteries for a collar for my daughters dog who didnt stay in our back yard he would run off and stay gone all day. Bought the system that shocks a dog if they run out of the covered area and it runs off a collar that uses a battery to deliver a small shock. These batteries lasted just as long as the ones that came with the original collar. These are also the same size battery that goes with the collar that shocks dogs who bark. I was against the shock treatment but my daughter was more concerned the dog would get lost or ran over . The batteries work well.
2,short of battery life,"Their genius wireless fencing system allows for a new battery type that I cannot purchase in bulk on the internet. I am writing about the battery itself; not the elaborate plastic screw-in system. The main complaint is that the batteries never last the six months as advertised. This alone accounts for fraud in that the battteries last on average 2 to 3 months, if ever that long. PetSafe sees themselves as an HP printer company, making their profits on ink in HP's case, and non-enduring batteries in the PetSafe case. It is sad to see such great inventions dirtied by off-setting devious and untrue testimonials. Amazon should be more careful of product claims.If you tell me my Standard Schnauzer continually test the boundary line, I will tell you this is nonsense. He is smarter than his Master and PetSafe in this matter, and continually shows how he remembers his first sting many years ago when he was young, I was younger, batteries were inexpensive, and PetSafe was most honest."
5,petsafe batteries,The Petsafe batteries are the same exact kind you pay twice that much for in a regular retail store. They are fresh batteries and exactly what we wanted. We will buy them again.
5,Got them and they work.,That's about it. I got them and they work fine in my dogs collars. I got a 4 pack and the price was definitely better than had i gone to the store.
2,disappointing and expensive,"These batteries are supposed to last approximately 3 months. Used properly, the did not last more than 1 week and some only 3 days. I contacted petsafe, and they told me it was the collar, which seemed to work fine, but they would not replace either as I bought them on line and no longer had the receipt! I won't buy anything else from them."
4,great value!!,"Great Value!! Batteries do not last very long...maybe three months. So, it is nice to be able to find a place to purchase them at a reasonable cost."
2,They don't last long!,"Easy to install but I've had them dead out of the package or die soon after or not much charge in them, making the collar barely work."
3,Batteries only last about 2 months.,"These batteries only last about 2 months. I have two dogs with the petsafe wireless collars, and no matter the strength setting, the batteries only last about 2 months.Though, my dogs are pretty well trained to stay within the zone, so it isn't that much of a problem! :P"
1,lasted one month,"Battery only lasted a month. They should have made the device take regular batteries you can buy anywhere, not require proprietary batteries."
1,Dead Batteries,I seldom buy items with such a low rating...but decided to this time. Now I know why I don't ever do that. Both batteries out of the first package were dead when I put them in the collars. Hesitant about opening the second package. I think I will go to the local Petsmart and buy them instead.
5,Just like the ones I buy locally,"These were identical to the kind I pay a fortune for at the local pet stores and I have 3 dogs on our wireless system. We go through batteries in each collar about every 3 months, so buying them on here for about 1/2 the price is a great saver! They work just as long and fit perfectly."
1,Peice of chit,Batteries last 2 days. Don't waste your money. PetSafe is a ripoff anyway. I'll try fido's fences version. Worthless peices of chit.
1,Misrepresentation,This product was advertised that it would work with the bark collar I had purchased at the same time. That was very incorrect infomation. First off the bark collar came with batteries and they dont even slightly resemble the battery that works with the collar. Extremely Disapointted!
2,dont last,"first off. i usually buy this in stores . but amazon bundled something i didnt need for another dog related product. they dont last. my beagle runs them down with no problem in a bark collar. get cheaper , or last longer..."
5,great!,I bought this as an extra bettery for my dogs collar. The battery lasts awahile and was easy to install.
1,Dead batteries!!!,"I ordered this product for my boxer because he likes to bark at things when he's outside. I put the battery in his collar and tested it, the light came on and it beeped. The next day I noticed that it wasn't lighting up or beeping when he barked. It was dead. So, I put the second battery from the same package in his collar. Again, I tested it and it was fine. The next day, DEAD. So, I do NOT recommend this product. Seems to me they are selling dead batteries that'll have just enough oomph to work when first testing."
3,Works ok but doesn't last very long.,We got the indoor fence system to keep the dog out of a part of the house. We didn't realize that the battery had died until the dog had gone into the off limits area after about three weeks of use. We took the collar off at night but didn't disconnect the battery. So we got this second set of batteries and make a point of disconnecting the batteries when putting the dog to bed.
2,Batteries Don't Last,"I purchased the wireless fenced containment system and two pack of backup batteries. I had seen advertisements that batteries lasted 3-6 months. Not for me. I received them at the end of July, and they just died on September 23. Just under two months, with the dog wearing a collar maybe an hour a day, and almost never testing the boundaries. I am happy with the containment system, but not with the battery life."
4,Serves the purpose intended,"Good price and an even better deal with Prime ""free shipping"". I am not a fan of proprietary batteries but i'll deal with them to keep the best bark collar working, just wish they would last a little longer."
2,Good Dremel project,"The battery itself works. Not very long though. If you have a dremel, you can do I what I've been doing. I carefully cut out the plastic between the two battery connectors and removed the top metal cover plate, removed the two CR2032 batteries, cleaned out the cavity, made a notch to easily remove batteries in the future, and ordered 50 CR2032 batteries (equivalent of 25 RFA-67's) for $10. I've come to understand that it's not a problem with the batteries (in most cases) but the shock collar box. With all the time and money invested in the system, I'm not going to throw past money & effort away, but you can be guaranteed I won't be buying these again unless I need another dremel project."
5,hard to find batteries,"I tried to find these batteries at local stores, and each one were out. When they quoted me a price for them, it was about four times the amount I paid for them through Amazon.com. Now, I know you can save a lot of money by ordering on the website. Have a wonderful day and may God smile upon you. Thank you."
2,wrong battery,"this battery was listed as fitting my small Petsafe bark collar and it did not. The cost to return them was not worth returning them. My collar takes 3 volt not 6 volt and these should never have been listed with the collar I have,"
1,My Petsafe collar requires batteries to be changed far to frequently.,"I purchased an older model, new from Petsafe and it requires CR 2032 batteries. It is very inefficient. They put small batteries in the collar that require them to be changed often. A cost of $4.50 to change the batteries every few weeks makes the PetSafe collars far too expensive to operate. They should have put rechargeable AA or AAA batteries in the collar instead. I will never buy one again. Now, it's time to buy again and it looks like they are still using batteries that are too small."
1,PETSAFE 6 VOLT BATTERIES,I DO NOT THINK THAT THE BATTERIES WERE FRESH. DOESN'T SEEM TO BOTHER MY DOG WHEN HE BARKS.
1,Poor sales,"I ordered some replacement batteries and was told that they would be here last Wednesday. It is now thursday of the next week. I have emailed them and told them to email me or call me to let me know where my package is and to no affail, no call. I will never order from Petsafe again!!!"
3,This was a gift,"I purchased this for someone who loves the scent but can no longer find it in stores. It came wrapped and sealed with plastic however, when opened, the recipient could not get the top off to spray the perfume. She had to unscrew it and remove the sprayer to use it. Good thing she loves the scent but I was somewhat embarrassed."
5,Licensed Cosmetologist and Product Experts review,"What can I say? I have 2 perfumes that I absolutely adore, this is one of them. I used to love Angel until everyone and her sister started wearing it. Thats when I discovered this one. I can't find it in stores anymore so I am hoping that it has not been discontinued. That would stink. I will buy this at this price, but, it may be my last bottle. It was cheaper than this for this amount at Neiman Marcus. Just sayin'.Licensed Beauty Pro"
3,hmmm...not the best...but still good,"i got this book as a gift from my grandmother a few days ago, and i must say it's very...mediocre. some of the art is beautiful, but about a quarter of the art is done by an artist who tends to draw females looking like robots (right-angled noses, pointed lips, flat faces). in my opinion, i think this artist should have his pencils snapped in front of his face and be promptly fired (he has done art for other HTDM books as well, all equally bad, IMO). however, with that aside, i you're an artist who tends to draw only females (like me!) then you should certainly get this book, since it covers the aspects of manga women such and curves, clothes, and styling.NOTE: i strongly do not recommend this book for the not-quite-mature-yet drawer. it contains a great deal of bondage and skimpy outfits, and has a lot of excess nudity. just a forewarning :-)."
4,A great help.,"I found this book to be extremely usefull, but I recommend getting the first book on Bishoujo characters before this one. It covors many types of clothing, which inculdes not only different fashions, but materials, and states such as wet clothing. It does not, I noticed, covor different face types, as the first did, which is one of hte reasons I recommened this one second, since the first is abit more basic. there is quite alot of nudity, but it does not amount to porn and such. Most of the nude drawings are simply to tell what the body would look like under clothing and things like that. There are,however, afew pages on bondage clothing. In the end, there is a complete picture that would be considered extremely mature, of two women. There is also a page on a body wrapped in gauze or ribbon, though I am not exactly sure as to why.This book was an extremely good help. I gave it 4 stars and recommed it to the experiened Manga artist."
4,Amply Titled,"The ladies of Straight Ahead show an incredible range of talent, creativity and heart. From the resonant voices to the superb strings, these women hold their own in the world of jazz.The finely crafted ""You Touch Me"" and ""Once upon a time"" are stellar."
4,Great for the gammer who likes things to look nice.,This is a great tool for any AD&D player who likes to keep things organised and neat looking. Great but still a little easy to make on the computer.
1,"Why buy, when you can get one free?",There are hundreds of character sheets available through the internet. So why buy this when you can choose what kind you like and print it free from the internet.
2,Hooha for those stuck in the rules,"Ever since I started playing AD&D I have found the character sheets to be too small, restrictive, and limited to the rules of the book. If you need any kind of flexibility then the best idea is to get some free character sheets and then to design your own. Don't waste your money on this stuff unless you really have no intention of branching off the Basic AD&D rules"
4,The More You Listen The Better It Gets,"Most REM albums are not made for those who want a catchy tune that they are sick of in a week. REM is usually going to have to grow on you and once it does you are not satisfied until you've had your fix for the day of the album. This album is not exception, when I first listened to it I thought it was dull, I wanted more songs like ""Bad Day"", ""Animal"" and ""Great Beyond"" but now I'm really starting to appreciate the album the way the band released it. One reviewer was talking about changing the tracks and adding more fast songs, I understand it but I don't agree with his choices to remove songs like ""Make It All OK"" which I think is one of the highlights of the album. This goes to show that it's fine to make your own mix but I want to appreciate what the artist intended. In closing I do hope the band still plans to get back to more rock music soon and make albums that can be just as satfying with a much stronger beat."
1,Good Grief,"What marketing genius came up with this? Repackage the same boring songs and charge twice as much. I am embarrassed for Mike, Peter and Michael to use this type of marketing on their fans just to add a little cushion in their wallet. I'll save my money for the complete REM box set (from day 1) and hopefully it will include some behind the scenes pics and videos from the early days and not some lack-luster posters just so they can sell it as a ""special edition"" People please...be smart and do not encourage this type of marketing. Just buy the regular cd and enjoy."
3,Automatic Pilot For The People!,"I love R.E.M. I have all their albums, 30 odd singles & EP's and a heap of boots. I enjoyed most of the mellowed out Up & Reveal but Around The Sun, a third laid back album in succession, is too much of the same thing. I was wondering whether they had become too content with their lot. I need not have worried, these guys realised the errors in their ways not long after this release and returned with the vibrant, excellent Accelerate in 2008, and not a Dean Martin or Great Crooners cover album. Let's hope each future studio release is out there and challenging from now on."
3,Such high hopes...,"I've been an REM fan for a long time and couldn't wait to get my hands on their new album. I think Up is a great record; New Adventures is good and even Reveal is listenable. Around the Sun is just flat. The opening two songs are good. After that - it's all indistinct, similar lyrics, uninteresting tunes. Nothing outstanding, nothing even particularly REM sounding (other than Stipe's voice, of course).I guess I'll have to wait for their next album."
2,Stipe's solo album?,"Bill Berry is gone (and he took more than we ever knew with him). Mike Mills' bass is gone (as are his backing vocals). Peter Buck's guitar is nowhere to be heard. What we are left with is Stipe and a piano. This is basically the REM we have heard now on the last 3 albums (Reveal had a few moments but not many).Has Michael Stipe gone solo and not told us? This album starts off pretty nicely with the first 3 songs. Then, your grandfather's REM kicks in with eight Up-ish lullabies. While Stipe's voice is still strong and beautiful after all these years, it simply can't carry 3 albums in a row like REM would like us to believe. In fact, that should be the title of their next album -believe; because right now, I'm not."
1,It's Simple...,"It's simple... If you like everything from Out of Time up until now, you will probably like this one. If you are a fan of the classics (Pre-Green) save your money as this is yet another bore.Everyone that gives this 5 stars and then says it takes some getting used to and that it has strong areas and weak areas...do you understand what 5 stars means? Flawless. Try giving 1 2 or 3 stars if this is not going to stay in your cd player more than 3 listens. It should also tell you something that the cd has barely been out 24 hours and people are already unloading it on EBAY.Does anyone have any tissue for ""Justin GentTimberlake?"" This cd will go nicely next to his Shiny Happy People single."
1,awful spaced-aged adult contemporary uber-hipness gone wrong,"Never have Stipey's lyrics been so obvious and/or clumsy, the instrumentation...errr, music could've been lifted from Amy Grant's next next album. ""around the sun"" is frightening in its ability to remind folks like me who, at age 16 bought Chronic Town, that age so often equals loss: too bad R.E.M. has lost it and forgot to record it as it left."
2,May cause drowsiness,"There are 2 amazing songs (""Leaving New York"" and the title track) on this album. ""Electron Blue,"" ""I Wanted To Be Wrong"" and ""Ascent of Man"" are also extremely good. The remaining tracks are all also solid and could fit easily as a change of pace tune onto even the best REM albums. Why only two stars then? ""Around the Sun"" is a collection of change of pace songs. Throw them together, and you have a beautiful, long snooze fest."
1,Worst REM album - by a considerable margin,"I have always been a huge REM fan and will continue to listen to all their albums faithfully... except this one. I have seen some reviews that have talked about this being the return of REM writing music from the heart... this might be the case but the album lacks soul. After three listens, there was not one song that moved me at all.Save your money for something better."
3,If this is 5 stars-then what is Automatic For The People?,"People, you don't have to continue to give R.E.M. albums 4 & 5 stars out of respect for the band. Yes, R.E.M. was and maybe still is a great band, and this record doesn't necessarily take that away from them. But you must call it what it is--a mostly boring, monotonous sound which lacks the depth, dynamics and texture of their previous releases. The thing that made R.E.M. great in the late 80's and early 90's was their ability to change pace and emotions with the additions of (not so rock n' roll instruments) such as the mandolin. In summary this album lacks diversity and amplitude changes."
5,"Very Impressive, they have their ""heart"" back","I have been an REM fan for about 15 years, since I first heard them on MTV Unplugged singing the songs from their latest release ""Out of Time"" I was floored. I bought that cassette and I don't think it left my player for more than a month. As we all have grown who loved REM as teenagers, REM also have grown. I personally think change is a good thing. If everyone of their albums sounded the same over and over I would not like them.I remember the rage over ""MOnster"", how everyone said ""Automatic for the People"" was ""too slow"". Now it is on most people's top ten must have albums list! This album in my opinion is one of their best....especially check out ""Leaving New York"", ""Make it all Ok"", ""Wanderlust""...change is OK everyone. Just take a deep breathe. Try to be open minded, and you will really enjoy this album. Great lyrics, great REM...."
2,REM stopped writing standout tracks,"remember when REM used to write songs that stuck in your head while you walked around whatever setting you happen to walk around? even their more experimental stuff had tracks like that (such as Up).this has none of that. almost all of the tracks have this country twang to them that makes them practically unlistenable. sure, REM has been known to do that in previous albums, but not to this extent. and they used to write good songs.the second track is pretty good, but other than that, this is a sleeper. i agree with the reviewer who said REM is doing nothing different than bands like hootie and the blowfish...this is exactly like that. you can expect to hear this stuff on ""adult alternative"" stations, stations i typically try to avoid with every inch of my life."
1,Worst album ever,"Not only the worst REM album ever but close to the worst album ever made by anyone. Not one good song on this heap of crap. No melodies, no riffs, nothing memorable."
2,The worst album since Up!,"Total mush. I was an R.E.M. fan, but I bought this CD without hearing any tunes on the radio first and now I know why. The band must be on painkillers these days or something..."
2,Save your money for something better,"Document is the only REM album you'll ever need. Buy it, and enjoy. Buy this album, and you'll be asking why you wasted the sixteen dollars."
3,Growing pains,"Having enjoyed the realese of 'Bad Day' and having loved the video [I personally think its the best video of 2004], I was expecting a simpler, more dominant sound in 'Around the sun'. I also expected, and hoped, for a lyrically profound album.The reality is that this album appears to be undirected and overproduced. REM are the most important American band of the past 20 years but they missed the mark with this one.I feel that they could have been served well if they gave more attention to Mills and Buck. With so much electronica and synths, it begins to feel a bit like a solo album by Stipe. I challenge some one to point out where I can heard Mills bass - here he is nothing more than back up vocals.I enjoyed the album, nonetheless. I don't think that REM could write a bad album but I expected more, having looked to them [the masters] to provide some relief to the nonsense that dominates the Virgin megastore shelfs."
4,so much hate...,"Can you remember what was said about Fables of the Reconstruction? People (including the band) hated that album and trashed it pretty thoroughly, but now many people consider it one of their best. This is a great album. Turn off the voice in your head comparing it to the other REM albums you already love (but have played to death) and just enjoy it for the warm, spacious, and beautiful album that it is."
3,All I can say is that this album is fair...,"After experimenting with mind numbing noise on Monster and New Adventures... REM has turned to electronica (UP) and classicist REM (Reveal). This album is a combination of the two. The result is a relatively overproduced dull sounding album that hardly even sounds like REM. In fact it sounds more like a Michael Stipe solo album. The album takes very few risks, everything is pretty much straight down the middle of the road. There aren't any really bad songs or any really good songs. There aren't any really fast songs or any really slow songs. Everything just sort of blurs together. There are a few songs that are decent on their own. However listened to back to back the songs start to sound the same. Hopefully REM will take some notes from U2 and go back to their strengths. Straight forward, band oriented, folk rock..."
3,Contiues disapointing streak,"I'm probably not a fair reviewer of this album. My memories of R.E.M. date back to Fables and Lifes Rich Pageant during my teenage years.The band has lost something since then, and certainly since Bill Berry left the band. This is a nice sounding album, good to listen to while cleaning the house or driving. But that's it. There's no spark to any of the songs, its hard to separate them in your mind. Do I wish for another ""Feeling Gravity's Pull"" or ""Driver 8"".Basically, if you like their last two albums or are really into the Adult Alternative format, buy this. Or if your a dedicated fan. Otherwise, it's time to move on."
2,Not the REM i knew,"it sounds old, sad, and sorry. lame songs, not one is upbeat or funny, nothing like the good ol' stuff like stand or orange crush songs. just old sad songs. i'd say its a poor attempt to a come back."
3,Around the Sun,"Around the Sun being REM's 13th album and their 2004 release is an ok album and it was met with lukewarm reviews by the critics. Allmusic give it 2 stars and Rolling Stone Magazine give it 3 stars. The album spawned four singles. These being ""Leaving New York"", ""Electron Blue"", ""Wanderlust"" and ""Aftermath"". The album peaked at #13 on the Billboard 200. The booklet is quite massive with all the lyrics included and on the back of the lyrics has a massive poster. 3/5."
4,My version of Around the Sun,"I tend to agree with the reviewers that are saying this album is a little slow although in general I like it although not as much as past glories like ""Automatic For the People"" or ""Document"". So to liven it up a bit I have created my own version. For those who own a CD burner and the REM best of ""In Time"" take three slower songs (in my opinion the weak links of the new album) OFF! Those are ""Make it All Okay"", ""High Speed Train"" and ""Worst Joke Ever"". In ""Make It All Ok's"" place put ""Bad Day"" from the best of and in place of the other two slow songs put ""Animal"" also from the best of. Those two songs have the energy that this album is lacking plus they came out only a year ago so kind of go with these new songs (probably recorded around the same time). It takes it down to a trim 12 track album and automatically warrents an extra star in my review! Try it you will be happy."
1,R.E.M. Worst Album - By Far,"I've been listening to the group since the beginning, and this is simply an awful album by any standards, much less by R.E.M. standards. Incredibly disappointing."
1,they are lost...and irrelevant,"REM, lets face it have not put out a good album since they became a threesome. It's clear that Berry wasn't just a drummer but perhaps the best songwriter in the band (Perfect Circle, Driver 8 are on record as being his, but the band gets credit for all songwritng so its tough to tell unless Stipe revels it in an interview)The songs are pointless now, without any passion or power.The Who sucked without Moon. Sometimes it better to burnout than to fade away."
1,fading into eternity,"Every song on record is GARBAGE except Electron Blue.Maybe this will give R.E.M. some incenstive to make better music and try a little harder next time.Folks, time to look back into history..."
2,CDs as Frisbees,"CDs can be thrown as frisbees, if the tossing motion is careful and guided. You might be able to throw a CD through a hoop, or better yet, in a car, as a driver (Driver 8), send the platter spinning through a passenger-side window. Drop the window from the electric controls on your side and fling it: there it goes! I-95 is all the richer.This CD has three decent cuts and the rest is interminable.I have EVERY REM release sunce the band debuted with an EP in 1982.I still hope; but as time goes by, it's just plain hard."
1,STILL WAITING FOR A COMPLETE ALBUM SINCE LIFE RICH/DEAD LET,"BASICALLY WHAT HAS HAPPEND TO THE RYTHYM OVER THE PAST 15 YEARS. IT SOUNDS LIKE A 45 PLAYED AT 33. I KEEP HOPING FOR ENERGY AND A LITTLE BEAT AND NEVER GET IT. I MISS LISTENING TO ALBUMS COVER TO COVER. I THINK THE GREEN ALBUM WAS THE DECISIVE DECLINE OF REM. THEY WERE GREAT UNTIL THE 90'S. I MISS THE GUITAR STRUMMING, THE BANJO, THE REAL INSTRUMENTS. I WASTED $14 ON THIS ONE. ALMOST EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME, LIKE HE'S READING POETRY. SONGS 2-4 AND 6-14 MIGHT BE THE SAME SONG, OR ATLEAST MUSIC.....I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I STARTED DROOLING AND THEN WOKE UP.THEY SHOULD ASK MITCH EASTER OR DON DIXON TO PRODUCE AND ALBUM FOR THEM LIKE CHRONIC TOWN. ITS DEPRESSING"
2,Disappointment at the Heron House,"Where have all those ""rivers of suggestion"" gone? I am a huge R.E.M. fan but this is their worst album ever. Even REVEAL (another mediocre album) sounded better and more siphisticated. I am really upset. I thought this would have been a great album; they have been writing and recording it for more than 2 years but it seems like it took just 2 days to do it. ""Make it all okay"" is simply pathetic...what? ""turn away and shut the door""???...is this melodrama? yes it is. i feel so bad to say this things but it is true, and it hurts. I would only save ""Aftermath"", a beautiful song. that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1."
4,Good solid album,"I love the way some reviewers make grave pronouncements on REM's ""form"" over the years as if they (the reviewers) were Moses coming down the mountain with the commandments. REM is a great rock band, not the second coming. This album is, put simply, a collection of very well written, mid-tempo pop/rock songs by three guys who know that they have nothing to prove to anyone.They're all into their forties now (I think), and - get this - people change! Therefore, this doesn't sound like Automatic, Monster, Up, etc. It's still good stuff though. If you won't be excommunicated by your trendy, angsty friends for buying this album, I would strongly recommend it."
3,"R.E.M. ""Around The Sun""","""Leaving New York"" (10/10)""Electron Blue"" (6/10)""The Outsiders"" (7/10)""Make It All OK"" (6/10)""Final Straw"" (7/10)""I Wanted To Be Wrong"" (6/10)""Wanderlust"" (7/10)""Boy In The Well"" (7/10)""Aftermath"" (8/10)""High Speed Train"" (6/10)""The Worst Joke Ever"" (6/10)""The Ascent Of Man"" (7/10)""Around The Sun"" (8/10)R.E.M.'s latest effort, ""Around The Sun,"" is mediocre at best. I got bored with many of the tunes and a lot of them seemed to just drone into one another. There is some good stuff here, like, ""Leaving New York,"" ""Aftermath,"" and the title track.Overall rating: 7 out of 10."
2,"Oh, I'm so sorry...","Let me begin by saying that I really, truly am a diehard REM fan. I've adored them since Murmur (I know that might sort of disqualify me since it's not since Chronic Town) and have loved at least several songs from every album (I date myself!) and CD, even Monster, even Reveal, which several critics on this site have compared to Around the Sun. I even gave one reviewer the benefit of the doubt and listened to it several times before reaching the agonizing conclusion that it really just completely blows. Never have I heard an REM recording that was so completely forgettable from start to finish. With the exception of Leaving New York, whose hooks I can call to mind if I want, I still, after five or six listenings, can't recall a single note from a single other song on this CD. And that's really sad, and something I NEVER thought I would be able to bring myself to say about anything REM ever did. Nor did I think I'd ever say this: REM, you're finally All Washed Up."
4,Revelation,"I wasn't sure what to make of the album at first. I was immediately hooked into ""Electron Blue"" and ""The Ascent of Man."" Now, six weeks since its release and my purchasing it, ""Around the Sun"" has revealed itself like a slow-blooming flower as a gorgeous soundscape of incredibly textured melodies and some brilliant craftsmanship. Give this album a chance, don't diss it the way most music critics have--they're generally idiots anyway--and just fly with it. Now, I truly adore so much of what's on this album. In addition to the songs mentioned above, I love ""Boy In the Well,"" ""Wanderlust,"" ""High Speed Train,"" and the title tune. Beautiful stuff by passionate, consummate musicians at the latter-day peak of their powers. ""Around the Sun"" will survive in the long run and outlast all the naysayers who tried to rip it apart. Their best easily and in many ways since ""Automatic for the People."""
2,Disappointed...,"First of all I love REM. Second I dont hate REM b/c they dont have a drummer anymore. And no, they dont need to be rocking like they did in the 80's or need to make another poppy Automatic for the People. However...they still needed to make a better album. If you want to hear a GREAT non-rocking REM album - get ""UP"" instead of this one. The album starts off well for the first 3 songs...and goes downhill fast. I was really hoping that this album would be better than their last album REVEAL--and it's not."
5,This IS a strong album,"I had not listened to this band since New Adventures, which I really liked. I had not purchased the last couple of albums because people I know said that they were not good. Then I heard ""Leaving New York"". The song was very well crafted and sounded great. About a six months later I bought the ""Around the Sun"". I did not have high expectations due to the Amazon reviews, but ""Leaving New York"" kept creeping into my mind at work and I wanted the song.Anyway, I think that the CD is great except for a few songs that are just good. Too often older bands like R.E.M. get dismissed later in their careers. People seem to remember the songs that they really liked and keep expecting to hear more of the same. Well, that's just too bad. This is possibly the best CD that I have bought in the last year."
3,"Nice enough, but missing more than just Bill Berry","The album is nice enough, but has the feeling of sameness from song to song. It needs a rocker or two and some of classic R.E.M.'s jangle. 'Leaving New York"" and ""Electron Blue"" are good songs to kick off the album, and the rest of the record is very listenable, but unremarkable and a bit too cohessive. I just listened to it twice and thought it was good, not great, and in the past R.E.M. has been great. Here, they sound a bit tired - competent, but tired."
3,The Glory that is R.E.M is vanishing...,"I was so looking forward to this album wondering after sometime of reinventing themselves what the fellas from R.E.M would come up with. I have been a long time fan of this band and own all their extensive albums and love many of them except for 'Up' and 'Adventures in HI-FI'.Listening to this album once and then twice over, I was suprised in a not so good way. There are only 3 notable songs and 1 is sung with a guest singer Q-Tip in 'The Outsiders'. 'Leaving New York' is a plain dull song, I can't make out what's so good about it? 'Electron Blue' is another nice song with slow beats and a nice fitting lyric prose.The last two songs are the greatest disappointments with 'Ascent of Man' and 'Around The Sun' being so unimaginably dull. I hope this isn't the start of the down slide of R.E.M."
3,first listen,"so after a first listen about a week ago i was kinda disappointed. i think that it might have been the production that got me at first. this albums has a lot of accoustic tracks that i think would have been just as strong if they did not have the odd noise/synthy stuff in the background that sort of melts all of the sound together. lyrically there are a few strong points, but i dont feel that overall it will be one those R.E.M. gems thatll stay in my disc changer for the rest of my life, or anything. still, the album, is better than most of the shlock that is out there right now.the three stars that i have given this album is after several other listens and i still cant get passed that droning feeling i get. three stars is what i would also give an album like reveal. my fives would be hi-fi and lifes rich pageant and reckoning, if that gives my listening any perspective. if anyone really cares"
1,Bland Bland Bland,"I am a long-time fan of REM. I was once a purist, but I have come to really enjoy the group's transformations over the last 10 years (I disagree with evaluations that mark their highpoint at *Automatic* and downplay later innovations). But my god, this new album is something I could not have imagined from the group: a bland, uninteresting, soul-lessly overproduced snooze-fest. Pay careful attention to those reviews that note the album's ""polish"" and prepare yourself to hear the sounds of Buck and Mills (and perhaps Stipe himself) mixed out of existence. This could be Stipe with any old band-for-hire, and its total lack of edge or texture makes it perfect waiting-room music. Now, REM gets to make a mistake now and then, so no problem; but let's not say this is a good album. It's the sound of something good going very -- and let's hope temporarily -- wrong."
3,Into the Ordinary,"I've been an REM fan for years, but the group seems to have entered its uneventful middle age. Up still had a few surprises, and Reveal was all pop craft. Around the Sun settles into a comfortable groove. The whole thing is realtively good, but also slight. I've honestly had trouble paying attention to the entire record. Electron Blue is the highlight of the album (imo) but nothing really scales the heights of prime period REM recordings. This record doesn't really seem to have much fire in it, but it's fine if you're just hankering for some new REM music. Unfortunately, Around the Sun does not deliver on the promise of the new tracks (Bad Day and Animal) from REM's best of last year. Maybe after a few more listens something will click and my rating will go up a notch. This tends to happen with REM records (Reveal took about a year for me to ""get"")."
1,around ur- anus,"This is R.E.M.'s worst offering, and I have been a fan since I was 13 and bought MURMUR with money I earned from delivering newspapers on my bike. I wouldn't steer you wrong-this album is just not worth the money or time, and I sold my copy to the used cd dealer about a week and a half after buying it and enduring it.I was bored silly and surprised they bothered releasing it. By no means is it as good as the John Metzger review says it is;""the album that 'Reveal' should have been""-I suspect that he was payed to write that.I was also surprised that it is included in anyone's ""10 best"" list for 2004, as it is my pick for the most disappointing of that year, and I'm glad that Peter Buck has Tuatara and The Minus Five projects to work with."
5,Music for Thinking People,"Some mainstream press have dismissed this recording as ""disappointing to its fans"" and ""too low key.""The reasons critics do this are: because there are no tracks immediately jumping up the charts(though ""Leaving New York"" is as ""commercial"" as anything REM has written) and most of our esteemed ""arbiters of taste"" don't spend much time actually listening to the music before making snap judgments in time for a deadline. Actually,ATS is one of REM's strongest albums,full of georgeous, memorable melodies and intelligent lyrics. There is not a weak track on the album. My advice is to give the record time,and its intelligence and brilliant craft will draw you in. You wont be able to take it out of your cd player... or your mind! It comes out of a long tradition of masterpieces-in-disguise like Pet Sounds or Love's Forever Changes which required time, intelligent listeners and the proper perspective to grant them their rightful status."
