1,Buy the domestic version on van richter records,"The Van Richter version has better packaging, remastered songs and three bonus tracks at a much better price"
2,Not much information,"The various subjects were good, but the questions were very sparse. The age group for which it was intended, would probably not use it."
5,Sad Book,"This book is very sad, yet beautiful. It tells the autobiographical story of Jack Kerouac, who is now forty years old, famous for writing On the Road, and has a problem with alcohol.Jack in this book, feels he is on the brink of madness. He has a hard time accepting the negative forces in life, such as death, and other people's insanity. He is much too sensitive for the world the way it is. He is a man who loves animals, feels a strong tie to his family, and saves insects. He also loves people very much.This novel almost seems like a horror novel in the parts where Jack describes his mental anguish. He never wanted to be famous, to be the 'king of the beats' and all he wants is some peace of mind, yet he has people following him around all the time. Even the atmosphere at Big Sur becomes oppressive.The writing is beautiful and poetic, and hauntingly honest. The book ends with a poem echoing the sounds of the sea at Big Sur."
5,Kerouac's soul painfully exposed,"Over the past two weeks I read, as a trilogy of sorts, 'On the Road', 'Dharma Bums' and finally 'Big Sur'. The word that comes nearest to describing 'Sur' is devastating. Kerouac's realization that his past as 'happy poet' was filled with human pride and ignorance of the pain of others ripped my heart out, after my feeling his deep love of life in the two previous books. It's a truism, but as Kerouac himself said, 'truisms are all true', but one can never feel the pain of others, and only through our own pain, can we even begin to touch the feelings of humanity. But in 'Big Sur', one comes close to feeling the grit and sweat and bleeding of Kerouac's soul"
4,Tilting the bottle at Big Sur,"A very good and heartfelt book. One of Kerouac's best. Brave and awful in it's honesty... The cabin at Big Sur, Mien Mo Mountain, the beatniks of San Francisco, the fog, the surf, the canyons, the author sitting on the rocks alongside the Pacific Ocean and writing down all that the ocean tells him, the paranoid ravages of alcohol delirium tremens, the wild imaginings of all those evil forces out to get him, the agonizing, the haunting, the warlocks and the UFOs...Poor Jack suffered through it all--but by his on volition! Most of the time he was only ""marginally there"" but he still composed himself long enough for the writing of this novel. At the end of it all you wonder how he ever did it.--Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001."
5,another printed masterpiece from the mind of kerouac,How many authors can write a book that you can read off and on and go back to without having to go back and reread. Great for busy people
4,One of the best descriptions of the horrors of alcoholism.,"The opening pages show Kerouac's true gift as a writer. The first 2 chapters are marked by fluent and haunting prose that describes the hopelessness and suffering of alcoholism. As others have remarked, the book is flawed, but a must for anyone who is interested in the Kerouac canon."
5,"I've wanted this movie for so long, I purchased the Spanish version","The Spanish version of this movie ""Loca del Corazon!"" is in English with Spanish subtitles. If you can ignore the text, you have a fabulous movie. I just purchased a second one for a cousin that has listened to me rave about the film for years. I couldn't be happier!!!"
5,A golden gem! The best!,"Over the years I've owned two copies of this, and recently had to buy a third - alas, again only available in VHS. I wish they would release it on DVD. This is one I love sharing with friends. In DVD, I'd be able to give it as gifts to new friends. I enjoy watching it, but how wonderful it is to show this one for the first time to someone who has never seen it. I've done this so many times, and everyone who sees it wants it. Truly it is ""wonderful"" from the heart!! But, then Ruben Blades ALWAYS makes magic in all his many ranges of creative talents. Gracias Ruben!"
5,"Still ""Crazy from the Heart""",I originally caught this little gem on TV and was so delighted to find it on Amazon. It's a fun movie that at the same time addresses prejudices in a way that doesn't preach but shows them for what that are -- silly. Enjoy!
5,LOVE this movie!,"I remember seeing this movie on television many years ago, on one of the Turner stations, and fell in love with it. I searched the planet for the video (that was before DVD) and when I finally found it I was bummed to see that the cost was right around $100. No matter, I paid because I just had to have it. I hope it comes out on DVD so that many more people will have the opportunity to see this wonderful movie. It was the first time I fell in love with Christine Lahti as an actor and I have never turned back."
1,"vhs tape in terrible condition ,breakage thru out the movie,does not come close to the cost i paid for it","i loved this movie when i saw it on tv,however when i ordered the vhs tape the condition of the tape was terrible,constant lost of movie thru out the movie ,so bad youu could not understand any of the music in the background,like the tape had slimmage,not worth the expense of ordering this movie.i feel like i was cheated out of my money"
1,Video Purchase,I have never received this product as of 9/13/2010. I wrote to the seller twice and never received a response. I have filed a complaint with Amazon. I would not order from this seller.
5,"Cross-cultural romance -- Oh, My!","My husband and I often ask each other why our favorite movies are not very well known. ""Crazy..."" is one of these. I find that many of them have a common sensibility, namely a cross-cultural appeal. I don't even want to go there -- to that place that says such a gentle and loving movie as this cannot find its audience because of the determination of the American film culture to retain the old, ""traditional"" Euro-American bias. It's just too depressing.And where is William Russ these days? His ""Dew-ey"" is one of my favorite film characters of all time"
2,Loud,"Coleman Barks is my favorite translator of Rumi but this CD is not. Maybe it will work for the seasoned Rumi lover but for a new person I found Coleman having to rush to speak over the music. I couldn't enjoy the poetry because of the drums and fast paced music. I have no relationship yet with Rumi's poetry and just could not enjoy all the distractions. If you already know the poems the loud music may suit you. I was glad when it ended which is not what I was looking for. It didn't let me pace through the poetry, the loud drums and sitar were too forceful."
4,Can't read Rumi all the time,"Though I agree Coleman Barks Southern accent and voice are a out of place for me when reading Rumi myself, his passion for Rumi more than makes up for it. I am in my car a lot, so this set allows me to enjoy the poetry. It's relaxing, the music is perfect."
2,no redeeming qualities,"This is really awful. I gave it two stars instead of one because I think Barks is well-intentioned. But the music overwhelms the words and the musical selections seem not to have been considered in terms of what sounds might go with the words. And, a Tennessee accent may be good for some types of poetry, but for Rumi it is very odd, it has no resonance with the words. He should have had someone else narrate. Do not waste your money. Read Rumi instead."
4,Good translation; audio leaves something to be desired,"The poetry of Rumi is enchanting. Coleman Barks' translation is lyrical. Bravo!I find two imperfections in the audio quality of these CD's, though:1) Mr. Barks' voice is not the best for public reading. He sounds as if he is sitting some distance from the microphone and speaking loudly so his voice will be picked up.2) Sometimes the music is so loud it drowns out some words where Mr. Barks' volume goes down, such as at the ends of sentences.Overall, though, I enjoy listening to these readings and I plan to get more of Barks' CD's of Rumi."
2,Grating,"It gets two stars for unintentional hilarity (refer to some of the more embarrasing moments in the career of one Robert Goulet). Cast somewhere between the imploring musings of Deepak Chopra and his collaborations with 'celebs' like Demi Moore professing 'transcendence, if only one would aspire', the dictor here, is infused with a monotonous Southern accent that unfortunately renders Rumi as prosaic humdrum."
3,"Cool song, but not so necessary anymore","This single was a very nice find months ago because Soul To Squeeze was not released on any Chili Peppers albums, but only on the Coneheads movie soundtrack (or on the Live Rare Remix Box, which is now rare and pretty expensive considering it has about 15 tracks into 3 CD's). So anyway, now with the Greatest Hits compilation it doesn't seem such a necessary buy. However, the song is certainly cool and it has a special melancholic ring because it came out after John Frusciante had left the band, so it's just 3 members on the video. The b-side live version of Nobody Weird Like Me was a classic live performance from 1989-1993 and when John came back in 1998, so it can be found on many bootlegs, and even the same version. It is still a great song and it works for a b-side."
5,Can never go wrong!!!,I have loved every volume of the Unwrapped series. Since I was first introduced to them by a friend I have been a fan. I will say that I can always pick out when Karen Brigss is playing the violin. She is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Hidden Beach-Unwrapped. Keep them coming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Return,I returned this product. There should be a listing of tracks so people do not purchase the wrong thing. Very misleading. I thought Hidden Beach included artist Like Jill Scott. Not what I got on this CD. I will never buy another CD from Amazon that is a compilation unless the traks and artist are spelled out.
3,SOV Horror flick for gorehounds and partygoers,"A nucleur meltdown in Kansas City results in people turning into zombies forcing surviving residents to run, hide, and kick some zombie butt.Todd Sheets' breakthrough effort gets a lot of flack for its lack of script and rough look, but I honestly think that this is one of the funnest movies out there. Now all of the reviewers who thought of this movie as trash were of course right, and if you don't care for plenty of gore and a sensless plot, don't even waste your money on this gore classic. But if this is your thing as far as movies go, or if you just want a good party tape, go for this one. Good for a few laughs and a grossout or two.If you're looking for better scripted fare, but still want gore to go along with it, I recommend buying one of Todd Sheets later films like Violent New Breed or the Shivers.P.S - Watch for the gang fight choreography in this one, it has some of the most ""spontaneous"" stuntwork that I've ever seen."
1,Do Not Waste You'r Money!!!!!!!!!!,"STUPID, STUPID, AND EVEN MORE STUPID. Here's a little example of the acting. (Oh Gee, these things are not Human.) When reading that, read it very slow, and without any feeling what so ever! There is alot of Gore and Guts, but it's really fake looking that you laugh instead of being freaked out! Just dont waste you'r money on this stupid so-called zombie flick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Stinking Zombie Bloodbath - Avoid This Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this movie after reading the glowing...."" After watching the tape, I came back to this page to stare again at these reviews - this time with all the revulsion and horror that this movie portends to portray. I have a tape of a family BQ with more shock value and drama. Not one single moment of this film is ""campy"" or enjoyable. However, I know someone who made a movie not long ago called ""Attack of the Zombie Lettuce Growers."" It is a masterpiece! And you can buy it right here..."
5,Gift to my parents,"After watching the videos on the website I immediately knew I wanted to buy this DVD for my parents. Regular exercise and good nutrition for anyone can feel daunting. John's approach makes the idea of getting in shape and eating right feel very achievable, not difficult. My parents LOVE it and the workout card that comes with it helps them remember the routine once they are at the gym. Very inspiring..."
3,The Making of Henry,"Well, I love Hiward Jacobson so I enjoyed Henry. Can't help but feel some of it was autobiographical. Henry really is a flawed character, weak and lacking go but I found myself warming to him anyway!"
2,6 bucks,"I just received 4 chuck keys the small end has 3/16"" pilot the rest are 1/4"" it is made of cast aluminum and coated with black paint. The paint makes the shafts larger so they dont fit in chuck. I sanded the paint off mine so it wouid fit. There were no sparks and its nonmagnitic. I twisted as hard as i could and it didn't break but since it is made of aluminium Im sure it will not last long but 4 for 12 bucks is hard to beat.its a cheap lite use chuck keyUpdate.All four have broke. The heads twist off after only a few uses. They are made of cast aluminum."
5,good for any drill,"I loved this key because is 4 keys in one, sincerely i loved this item, easy to use and good price, thank you Pvh3424"
4,One song worth the price!,"I bought this just for the song ""Baby Grand"". Love, love the melody and interpretation of Ray Charles and Billy Joel on piano."
3,This game deserved better than this,"I was wary when I picked up this little book, and I was right. I am an avid Huskers fan and I treasure this game as a great game and a proud moment in Husker history. The team always will have a place in my heart. This tiny book didn't tell me much I didn't know. I guess they thought Huskers fans and others would just snap it up and not question it. Maybe they're right. I bought it. There's nothing wrong with what's here. What's wrong is what isn't here. I wanted to know so much more about everything and everyone connected to this game."
4,I Loved This Game,"The Ward, from Fragile Bits, is a unique scifi third person adventure game that offers significant gaming fun and challenges. The game is loaded with timed sequences, no less than five slider puzzles (solvable with the push of a button) and numerous other diverse puzzles and challenges. The production is beautifully designed. The game plays flawlessly with no technical problems. The story is well-developed and compelling. The Ward also provides a variety of situations for the player. In some areas you are entirely alone and in others, you must interact with other characters to move the story along. The game provides plenty of game time and is an all around sumptuous adventure feast."
1,Have No Idea,I have not received the item....so I cannot rate it. It looks really nice in pictures...but again it has not been received. This was ordered over a month ago. LAME LAME LAME
1,x52 Pro JUNK,Saitek X52 Pro is Junk. It lasted 10 MINUTES before it STOP working completely. You can go to the Saitek fourm and read first hand how many people are having problems with there Saitek X52 Pro is Junk. Read before you buy this Saitek X52 Pro is Junk. If Saitek was good before this x52 Pro something happened really bad since than...to put out a product that cost so much and to have so many people are having problems with now is really SHAMEFULL....
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"Non-functional junk. The pitch, roll and throttle axes did not even work -- that is, moving the stick or throttle had no effect. Even if those things had worked, the feel of the controls is clunky and unrealistic -- no better than a $20 stick from BestBuy."
1,Lousy,I would never buy another product from this person. He lied on the description of this product andd sold it for more than what it's worth. He never returned any emails and so I am stuck with the loss. I am considering not using Amazon anymore.
3,Feels... cheap.,"I expected more ""heft"" at this price point. They essentially feel hollow inside making the product itself feel cheap. The throttle control is really annoying as well. They put a notch in there so that if you want to go to afterburners you have to push a little harder to get over the bump or whatever method they used to create the afterburner zone. Problem is, it isn't always in the right spot and getting the throttle at 100% without going into afterburner is very difficult."
2,Get the Flight Yoke instead,"I received this as a gift and had to return it. It looks great and is built quite well, but it doesn't work well for simulators. The fundamental problem is that the auto-centering mechanism involves a concave metal ring that sits around the base of the stick. The friction induced by the movement of the ring against the base is significant, and make it incredibly hard to move the stick by very small amounts (as is necessary for maintaining level flight, for instance).In the end I got the Saitek PZ44 PRO FLIGHT YOKE SYSTEM GAME CONTROLLER instead, which doesn't have the same ""sticking"" problem, and is almost as accurate as the simulator controls at the local flight school."
5,Saitek X52 Pro Flight System is great,"I had an old Logitech Wingman Strike Force 3D and used it for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004. The airplanes were all over the place and it was very difficult to control things. After plugging the new Saitek X52 Pro Flight system, it made all the difference in the world. Very smooth and in control. I don't regret it a bit."
3,"Nice, But Vista 64 bit Users Beware","Overall, the X52 pro is very good, but the main spring could be a little more stiff, it can't be adjusted. The bad news is the MFD is very hard to get working an keep working in Vista 64 bit. If it initially works, do not uninstall FSX or it may never work again. Saitek does not have a solution on their forum. Many users have come up with solutions that work for them, but not in all cases. It should be Saitek's job to make it work correctly."
4,More than enough!,This joystick and throttle controller is more than I need! I'm a beginner in Microsoft flight simulator and this thing has alot of buttons that I still don't use! It's not easy to learn for beginners but I think of it as an investment for the future when I learn more stuff!The product is smooth and accurate which is great but it costs more than others!
4,Almost perfect,"Very nice product. It could be nicer if:1) The USB cable should be attached to the stick, not the throttle, so that it could be used separately.2) The stick handle could be more anatomic.3) They could have put some sort of lock for the reverse throttle. That detent is insufficient.4) The piece of software should be more user friendly.UPDATE: X52 Pro was used in the movie ""GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra"" to represent the 'Night Raven' and the 'Mantis' flight controls ! Take a look at the pictures I uploaded. Cool ..."
1,Waste of money,"After finally purchasing this item last week, I've come to the realization that Saitek is only interested in getting your money, not providing you a quality product or customer support.This two piece unit looks great but that doesn't make up for the fact the joystick will not function more than a few minutes at a time. Dozens of flights were interrupted by loss of power and watching the aircraft crash because of loss of control.Then when I attempted to contact Saitek we discovered their forums no longer accepted new members and they refused to respond to countless emails asking for assistance. At these prices, you'd think it would at least allow you to complete at least one sortie before shutting down but apparently Saitek has other ideas.Don't waste your time or money, buy Logitech or CH."
2,Second spring causes sticking,This controller has added a second tension spring around the yoke making small adjustments when flying almost impossible due to sticking. Another poster has experienced this as well. This one is going back and I will reinstall my old standard x52 which is very smooth.
2,here's why I'd NOT recommend this product!,"I've owned this cool..flashy looking thing for a year, until now more than 3 buttons, the rudder, and the mouse stick aren't working! 2 buttons were dead-on-arrival and the rest are broken down within time, just look for somthing better than this!"
1,Trash,"Pros:It looked nice when I plugged it in. Thats all.Cons:The first stick I received none of the buttons worked on the stick. I spent 6hrs trying to get it to work different drivers, different computers same result.I returned this stick to Amazon and they were very helpful and sent out a new one 2 days later.I plugged in the second stick and the joystick lit up for a second then went dead. No response from the stick at all.Saitek customer support is dismal and only suggest it is your problem or you can pay to ship it to them for repair.In conclusion I am returning this for a CH Fighterstick they are built solid as a rock and will last for many years."
3,Pretty contented,"I received the item on time. I had a problem with the unit. I thought I would have a return problem, but when the merchant heard that I purchased the unit through Amazon that was it. A refund was immediately issued. I do not doubt that if I purchased the unit directly from the Merchant, I would have a very hard time getting a refund. Amazon customer service is great. I recently used Google check out on a product. NO COMPARISON"
3,Saitek X52,I need a manual to indicate what all the button and controls do and if needed how to program them.
2,Can be worse but,Connections fail after 1 year. Connections between Gas and Joystick are very simple and are not made for this application.Yes you can mod them but should that be necessary with this relative expensive product?Some user also report cable break inside Joystick were cables meet a sharp round hole up to the hat.As with other cheap constructions its now very sloppy in directions.
2,Run Run Away!!!,"When I was 12, I must have worn out my cassette copy of this album by playing Run Run Away over and over. I usually got through about halfway of My Oh My before fast forwarding to High And Dry. I never (really NEVER) made it through the whole album because the songs were awful.I have heard that Slade was quite a rockin' band in the 70's. This is the album that kept me from ever finding out. I'd rather listen to the Thompson Twins. Slade had a big bag of nothing by the time this came out (I guess!)I gave this two stars: One for having a deal with CBS and the other for having a top 10 single."
4,Feel good tune.,"I still love pulling out my old cassette from high school and listening. Run Runaway is a Great, feel good tune, the drums at the start are incredible on a good sound system. If you like hard rock ballads like Sister Christian by Night Ranger, you'll love My Oh My. The other songs are hit and miss, and I agree with another review, probably not worth the high price here."
5,keep your hands off my power supply,The cd by slade keep your hands off my power supply is much beter the lp or the tape the sound is beter then i though i liked tape but when i got the cd it way beter.
4,"""Run Runaway"" got as high as #20 on Billlboard","I was on my way to Colorado Springs or Pueblo, on I-25 near the Air Force Academy, when I heard ""Run Runaway"" for the first time. (I'm surprised to discover now that the song got as high as #20.) Believe it or not, I had never heard of Slade until the Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply album came out in mid-1984; it was only then that I learned that Quiet Riot's ""Cum on Feel the Noise"" was a cover of a classic Slade tune."
4,A Lot from a Little Book,"I didn't expect this much beauty and feeling from a small graphic novel, so this book was much more than I anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised by the touching story line. The graphics are beautiful."
3,"Not a bad movie, but not too noteworthy either","I wanted to like this movie, but I had some issues with it. The pacing was slower than I would have liked, and it seemed like too many people had a motive to take the gun except for the person who actually did take it. There were a lot of things that didn't make sense and unanswered questions. For instance the cop said that he was carrying his gun while at the wedding because there was an escaped convict, but then he got so drunk that he couldn't remember what had happened the next day. I also didn't believe that people would be put in jail one day and let loose the next without anything happening to clear their name. I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but it left a couple of questions unanswered. It wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't that exciting either."
3,It's OK but sometimes it feels that I have seen this before,"Small-town Chinese policeman Ma Shan wakes up the morning after his cousin's wedding to discover that his gun has been stolen. Facing a three-year prison term, Ma Shan begins a relentless search to track it down. Among the people he encounters on his frantic mission are a powerful businessman, a former lover, and a liquor bootlegger, but when the gun is linked to a murder, the stakes get even higher...That's an interesting plotThe story is thereThe acting is wonderfulThe characters are interestingBut the reason why I'm not completely satisfied is that the movie feels a little too long for this kind of story, that I feel that I want to take a break from the movie and it doesn't keep me on my chairAnd also it feels I have seen this before from Akira Kurosawa moviesBut still it's a good film, not one of my favorites but I recommend it to all who wants new experience"
3,"Stylistically ambitious, but ultimately tedious","Jiang Wen'', the celebrated Chinese actor, spends a lot of time furrowing his brow and looking pretty blank in this movie. The credit sequence, suggestive of the extraordinary opening of ""Chungking Express'""''', is all about madly sped-up traveling shots--but nothing in what follows is speedy. The rather boneheaded detective stumbles from point A to B to A to C, without much reason or compulsion. The tone alternates between HK absurdity and the heaviness of ""characterization scenes"" meant to tell us something about a rather unlikable character. The best thing about the tedious movie, by far, is the location. The old town of Qingyan ', called Yunao ''in the movie, is quite located close to the provincial capital of Guizhou province, Guiyang, which accounts for the quite odd accents in the movie."
3,too watery,"it does warm, but that doesn't really do anything, nothing special.as the title describes, it's too watery, drips right off my toy..."
3,Astroglide warming liquid,It's not as slippery as regular astroglide; we won't buy it again. The warming effect isn't very strong either.
5,a beautiful soft album,"This is an album full of ballads and is just about the best thing he has done. (Maybe with the exception of 'Always guaranteed'. What I like is the unartificial nature of the songs. Melodic and soft, which I think Cliff did best, during the 1970's/1980's. Also of huge note, is the inclusion of his own songs. They are all amongst the best songs on here. Why Cliff did not include more of his own compostitions on albums is a mystery, as he wrote some incredible b-sides.Highly recommended."
1,This is trash,"Murder mystery that is is done by an amateur. So many things in this book made me roll my eyes in disgust or disbelief. The narrative jumps from thoughts of one person, to another (including the murderer). The murders don't make any sense whatsoever. Many things are very far fetched, the deductions by the heroine are pathetic. Too many coincidences. You need to be a giant of a man to break a neck of a young woman? What?! Just stay away from this, I will never read anything else by this author. And the main mystery of a backstory was rather lame and poorly told."
5,A riveting story,"I have developed more of a taste for historical mysteries, and I thought that this book did a particularly good job of depicting a realistic view of post-Revolutionary life in Maine. The cruelty of war and its effects on both soldiers and civilians are masterfully revealed, particularly as it exposed the lasting changes on the characters. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series."
2,You're better off re-reading the Scarlet Letter,"Adultery, a love child, a wronged and vengful husband returned, a Colonial American setting...sound familiar? Yes, the end is different, but it's not a surprising wind-up."
3,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed the book, but it did not live up to my expectations based on the 4 and 1/2 star amazon.com review. I didn't care for the resolution of the murder mystery, but I did like the story of the events that transpired to cause it."
4,Mystery set in post-Revolutionary War Maine,"Margaret Lawrence does for the post-Revolutionary war period in Maine what Ann Perry does for the Victorian era in England, that is, bring the times to life with a good story, compelling details and just enough background to teach historical context without intruding on telling the tale. I read it on an airplane trip and was totally absorbed. I recommend this book!"
3,Flawed central imagery,"I recently read Hearts and Bones by Margaret Lawrence, onthe recommendations made by my book group. I enjoyed it as an historical mystery, but I do have one important problem with the novel as a whole. Much is made of Hannah and some of the other women characters as being patchwork quilters. The problem is, the time frame of this story is late 18th century America. Most textile authorities agree that patchwork as a quilting form did not begin in this country until around 1820, when printed fabrics were becoming available and affordable to the masses due to industrialization. Ordinarily, I'd regard this as a small flaw, but inthis book, it's a pretty important theme. The image of women in thewilderness doing patchwork is a myth mistakenly disseminated duringthe Colonial Revival era around the turn of the 20th century. A flaw of this magnitude serves unfortunately as a distraction and mars the quality of the reading experience."
5,A great deal!,"This is a quality product that holds up. I've been using Viking products for a couple of years now (modems, memory, etc..) and I have had no complaints about any of their products. Amazon's price on this 32 mb card makes it a steal! Don't pass up on this great deal."
5,"Good size, good price","I use this little add-on with my HP Jornada 545. And well I have nothing to say, and that is simply because there are zero issues. I just plugged it in, and the integration was seemless. No problems, whatsoever"
5,Exactly what it promises...,"I'm amazed that an extra 32MB can be so much space. This product works well, and best of all, doesn't protrude above my Compaq iPAQ's top border. This tiny wonder is worth the investment...."
3,"good device, but too small","I got the unit free when I bougth my Ipaq through Amazon.Unit is very functional but I upgraded to 128MB very shortly after I was using my IPAQ. 32 MB is too small. If you are buying, consider a larger CF to start with."
4,Great faucet,"We bought ours over two years ago. After a couple of months the turn mechanism became very difficult to turn. We called the 800 number and Price Pfister sent us a replacement spout and a new filter for our trouble. It was the easiest correction under a warranty ever! The replacement spout has been fine since. The water tastes good and the filters are easy to find. The only criticisms I have is that the manual mechanism may be difficult for elderly folks or people with weakened hand strength to operate. (If purchasing a faucet filter for them, I'd recommend something like the Moen products). The second criticism is that the spout's dimensions make the end of the unit a bit top heavy. I wonder if the faucet would hold up to the ""kid test"" if wacked."
3,replacement of faucet,"I recently purchased a home that had been empty for awhile and when the people moved out, they left the water on and the pipes froze and burst. My kitchen Price Pfister faucet had a cracked filter when I moved in and the small opening for the filtered water sent a spray in all directions, therefore I can't use it. I would like to purchase a replacement faucet but you say you no longer stock this model. Where can I find a similar faucet and is it still guaranteed under the above conditions?Thank you for any help you can give me.Kathryn J. EwingPhone (270) 547-5434 or cell: (561) 628-6403"
1,ridiculous reasoning,From what I've read about this book it seems that the author underplays the likelyhood that humans will enhance their own intelligence through genetic manipulation and computer enhancement.
1,Unabashed Fiction,"You might as well have picked this up at a local Star Trek conference. As a Ph.D., and an active researcher in both artificial intelligence and cognitive science, I feel somewhat slighted that those of us who are trying to make real engineering progress in the AI arena are being represented by sensationalistic rubbish like this. It's widely accepted in the AI community that our entire research agenda will be made or broken by whether NP-complete problems will eventually be soluble. Kurzweil should go back and read up on Turing, especially his Ph.D. thesis. As for those who are looking for accurate predictions concerning the future of intelligent machines, look elsewhere. Take it from someone who knows, there's a LOT of work left to be done...and we don't even know what's doable yet."
3,Kooky but cool,"Kurzweil describes how the law of accelerating returns will allow us create AI and become immortal within decades. Unfortunately for all of us, increasing clock speed and transitor density doesnt create intelligence. Predicting when a computer will be able to search the chess game tree fast enough to beat Kasparov is far different from predicting when a computer will be able to simulate a human brain.That being said, this books is still a good read because these innovations will occur one day (assuming the law of accelerating returns doesnt get us killed which is actually pretty likely), but Kurzweil fails by wanting to believe that these AI breakthroughs will happen in his lifetime."
2,@Kindle Users : Poor quality of graphical illustrations,Kurzweil would have certainly be deceived by the quality of the kindle edition of his books... Some typos (a funny one on a passage about electronic books quality ;-) and almost every illustration is unreadableInteresting book but prefer paper edition to kindle one ....
2,evolution misunderstood,"Kurzweil's book is based for a large part on the premise that evolution (biological evolution) leads to ever more complex forms as if that is the 'goal' of evolution. Evolution is about mechanisms that perform well with regard to reproduction; nothing more or nothing less. This leads to a wild variety of lifeforms, some complex (and one form of intelligence) and some very simple. But some simple forms survive for millions of years. That is the 'successstory' of evolutin, not an ever growing complexity."
4,Are we the Machine?,"I am not sure there is anything I could say that someone else reviewing this book has not already said. My experience was hit & miss, reading the book in short spurts over a month or so a few months back. His expectations and theories of where computing is headed are intriguing, and you can easily correlate what has already happened and what has been announced to his theories. The title was published in 1999, but yet even with how fast computing has changed Kurzwell's thoughts flow along with the advances that have happened since 1999. Who knows what will happen, and the author could be a bit optimistic in his thoughts - but I think that is just a humans well wishes for our kind showing in his writing.The suggested readings & web links will have you reading & researching for a long time to come.I would venture to recommend this title to anyone who is interested or works with computing. Having a grasp on where we have been , and where we are (most likely) heading towards."
5,A great book.,"The Age of Spiritual Machines was a great book. It was witty, creative, funny, insightful and above all very informative. Ray Kurzweil is an outstanding innovator with a keen grasp of technology in this century and the next. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the future of human society!"
5,The law of accelerating returns,"Good on the details, good on overall perspective, good on insider insight, Kurzweil properly transforms the tired topic of machine intelligence into a thrillingly broad expose of the near future. His discussion of what he calls ""the Law of Accelerating Returns"" (Moore's Law is a current case) is especially valuable."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,This book was nothing short of a scientific revelation for me. After reading it I found myself thinking about the points made in it for weeks afterward. My poor friends had to endure my constant babbling and many bought the book just so they wouldn't have to listen to me any longer. This book changes the way you will look at the future and will put many vague notions you might have about where technology is going into sharp focus. A must read for anyone interested in technology and the future.
3,"An inventor, not a realist","Ray Kurtzweil mentions some impressive things in this, but for every viable argument he puts forth, he spouts off two bits of obvious nonsense. If you read this book, I suggest you skip the first two or three chapters--after that, he stops making so many predicitons and keeps himself a little more grounded.On the whole, entertaining but not edifying."
3,Same again,I think Kurzweil used up most of his good ideas on his first book about intelligent machines.
3,Our future,"I think that Ray Kurzweil is a little ahead of himself. Some of his predictions are a bit too far fetched if you ask me. However, some of his thoughts about privacy and e learning are going to be huge issues that we will deal with in the near future. Frankly, I find it a bit scary to have a computer inbedded in every part of my house though. I hope that we won't be as dependent on technology as Mr. Kurzweil makes it out to be."
2,magical science,"If you are interested in hard scientific stuff, this is not your book. If you like Star Trek, and science is more an outlet for fantacy than a quest for knowledge, you should be happy with this one."
5,excellent book,"There isn't much I want to say in the respect of giving away what the book is about, but I am very impressed with this work. The mere concept of machines becoming aware of their own state of being, though this isn't a new idea, is written very well. Anyone that would read this book will find themselves not being able to put it down. Definately worth the time to purchase and read!"
2,Out of date and careless research,"I had high hopes for this book as I am very interested in the future of electronic intelligence. Mr. Kurzweil is wordy without saying much and his predictions are way off. What made me suspicious of the quality of research was that in several places he referred to Washoe as a male gorilla who was taught sign language which he (Kurzweil) apparently thought funny. Washoe was a female chimpanzee who lived in Central Washington state, at the university, with other chimps who were taught sign language. A young male chimp was added to the group and she was observed teaching him sign language so he could communicate with the caregivers. So much for ""funny""."
3,"Not so fast, Ray","In this book Kurzweil assumes that because nanotechnology means everything might be produced for free, it will be given away for the ""benefit"" of humanity. But when did capitalism - particularly in its American form - give anything away for free?Kurzweil is not an economist or a sociologist. He ignores entirely the proprietary aspects of the new technologies, of which he is likely to be both a creator and a beneficiary.Only the most optimistic will enjoy reading this book."
5,A truly ming expanding view of the futue!,The author paints a picture that can't help but make people think that it is an exciting time to be alive. Personally it convinced me to give up smoking since because I can now envision a future where dying will be a thing of the past. At times the auther will lose the layman who is not familiar with this topice and the notes in the back of the book are guaranteed to lose almost everyone but none the less this has to be considered a mind expanding vision of the future. If you enjoy science fiction this is for you because in this book fiction meets fact.
4,Where are the people we love?,"I will not get into the whole question of whether or not machines as of yet show any signs of real self- consciousness or a ' spiritual life ' as we know it.I would just like to make one point which it seems to me raises questions about the validity of the whole ' spiritual machine' enterprise.We are what we are on the basis of our connection with, our need and love for other human beings. A ' spiritual machine' seems to me something like an ' individual's projection' for his own isolated self. It seems to me that the whole idea being set forth here shows a very small and limited conception of what the human situation and condition is, and what it means to really care for others."
2,"Fun for the causual reader, superficial for technologists",A two star for the technical browser and four stars for the lay reader. Mr. Kurzweil does a good job of narration.Platonic dialog was interesting approach to some chapters. You also left the book knowing how Ray thinks.Criticism. Mostly used linear projection of existent trends. Non-linear projects were surprisingly absent.A good airplane read.
4,"wow whatta developer, but it can't all come true","Great explanations of technical concepts that will influence the future by an incredible entrepreneur. Cool info on the beginnings of Luddites and some possible revolutionary influences on the brain and music. In the future... entertainment = VR, philosophical question = What is human/alive/sentient, computer = ubiquitious network, education = VR and chiplants, business = creation of new knowledge with educators as most important, arts = done by machines, health = longer life w/ implants/transplants/replants. What about ethical consulting, Ray ??? Interesting proposal for Kurzweil's Law of accellerating returns. Computers think, but humans learn much faster than artificial neural nets, hmmmm."
1,Check Out Keith Devlin's Book,"People wanting a counter-argument to Kurzweil should check out Keith Devlin's book, ""Goodbye, Descartes: The End of Logic and the Search for a New Cosmology of Mind."""
1,Highly disappointing...,"I don't understand why this book has generated so much hype (and that many stars on Amazon...). Poorly written, philosophically hollow, scientifically light, it failed to captivate me despite a very interesting subject. I find it also very superficial (maybe Kurzweil had to hurry to meet his century deadline). I want my money back..."
2,Entertaining but hard to take seriously,"His reasoning feels more like religious zeal, I just can't buy into his vision of the unbounded potential of intelligent software."
5,"Awesome, megalomaniacal, and fantastic.",Ray Kurzweil is my best writer. I love his books. He writes in a clear way and he is really persuasive. This book is the best book I have read about the future of artificial intelligence. It teaches you so many interesting topics on computational neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience. This book has been written in 1999 and some of its first predictions are about to become true in 2006. I believe in all of the Kurzweil's theories because I am writing and programming my undergraduate thesis on computational neuroscience. I am sure you will enjoy the book. It is worth the price!
5,Fantastic book,"This is a very nourishing book. There is so much in there that I can sit up in bed at night or curl up with it of an afternoon and have an enjoyable read or skim. It is a book you can keep going back to, always referring back. The herbal healing and nourish recipes are a resource for a lifetime. It would be hard to imagine needing anything else! Love it! If you love herbs and natural healing and health maintenance this is a must for your library."
5,Great for women going through the change,I found the herb resipes very helpful. She haves simple directions and easy to understand instrutions. Plane english.A great book for any women looking for an alteritve to terditional medisions.
5,classic,"this is a fantastically good book. I really like it.Home Herbalwould be a useful supplement. You do need to use fresh, organic herbs, and to like not abuse them, for this stuff to work well."
5,Herbal Healing for Women,"This is a fantastic book. The recipes and administration of natural remedies has been so helpful that I use this book all the time. Using this book as a guide I have been successful at easing may aliments and conditions including mastitis, fibroids, morning sickness, labor and hormone imbalances. I wouldn't be without this book. A must for any woman."
5,Very effective!,"I have used the ""recipes"" in this book and am amazed at how effective they are. I highly recommend this book."
4,Women ARE Natural Healers,"The information in this book is excellent and easy to understand and it was a great read. I have recommended it to others as an excellent source of information for not only themselves but for their daughters as well. The recipes are easy and they work. I especially found the cream recipe on page 100 wonderful, as my own experiments making creams were not working at all. A wonderful read!"
4,"A strong, fun collection","Having always mused over the matter of why so many poets write poems about nature when most modern poets live in cities (or at least in non-rural settings), it was refreshing to discover this book. It is a strong collection of poets mostly wrtiing in their voices about their experiences (most importantly) as we suspect they truly are. A collection like this also allows for the inclusion of some creatures that don't always get their just due in nature poetry, like roaches, or old stand-bys in new allocations (like horses pulling collection wagons or in the city zoo...you get the idea).A strong collection with a nice breadth of styles and voices, and a fair sense of humor bubbling just beneath the surface. Highly recommended, especially if you think all poetry these days is either loud and political or soft and pastorale navel-gazing."
1,"Poor Packaging, limited quality.","Yes, I know at 150 bucks you need to keep your expectations low for anything you may buy in the jewelry area. This thing arrived in a little blue/pouch bag with a small presentation type box included. Any jeweler with half a brain knows that you dont just throw any neckless in a bag and ship it out. It arrived a royal tangled knotted up mess. I worked at trying to get it apart for a few minutes but finally gave up. A blown Christmas present. Thanks Amazon. From what I could see of it, the quality is about what you would expect for the price. The clasp was thin-cheap-o along with the chain that held it all together. Once again, there are things you should NOT buy on the internet. Jewelery is one of them and Amazon should know better than letting the temporary Christmas help do the packaging not mention marketing of Christmas ""specials"".."
1,Boooring!,"A lot of nothing thru half the book. He brags about everything he was involved in, then he gets to combat and boom....nothing.All that training, brown-nosing...he says he is the best at everything, and he is sick or disabled when it comes to combat. I can see why he didn't want to accept a medal.He says he was in combat 32 days behind the Utah beachhead, yet so little is mentioned. Its like a complete month of combat is missing.I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend it."
4,The Story of a Soldier: Something for All Ages!,"I think everyone will find something to relate to in this book! For the generations of people who lived and fought during World War II, this book will bring back memories of that intense and brave time period. For younger generations, you will experience a sense of pride and patriotism as you read about those who fought for our country. Author Ivan Mehosky makes us feel as though we really know his father, Colonel Mehosky. I could not help but think of my own grandparents as I read this wonderful narrative."
2,Some Great Material but Poor Quality,"This 3-set dvd has some great material in it - interviews with John Ford and Wayne, a documentary with James Stewart, Henry Fonda, and John Ford, a Lucy show featuring Wayne, etc. However, some of the material - particularly the Art Linkletter show (of which Wayne appears only for a few seconds at most) and the Wild West show featuring John Ford, Gene Autry, and others had extremely poor quality. I would have preferred to pay more for the set to have restored footage. As it is, I have watched it and will put it in the Goodwill pile instead of adding it to my collection due to the poor quality of some of the items."
2,Vanish fluro 8# test,Not as good as vicious fluro. Has memory knots easily. It does cast well. Find it is of more use as a leader than a main line.
1,No Good,I bought this in 14lb test. It has been the worst line I have ever bought. On almost every cast it gets tangled up. It feels like having 20lb test on a small spinning reel. I will not buy it again.
2,Hard to use,I put this stuff on a spinning reel and had nothing but problems. It springs off the reel creating a rats nest. It is only good as a leader that you tie on the end of braid in my opinion.
5,Llamados por los niños entrantes,"Es más de un Elohim el que hace mención expresa del efecto que tiene el orar por los niños entrantes. De hecho, los Elohim Orión y Claridad hablan extensamente aquí sobre la purificación de miles de corrientes de vida entrantes luego de los decreto emitidos por los estudiantes del Grupo de Filadelfia en los años 50.En especial, el Elohim Claridad señala la importancia de la Pureza en los cuerpos de los que van a encarnar de manera que puedan reconocer las indicaciones de sus Cristos Internos y así realizar el Plan Divino que cada uno guarda en el corazón.Por esto, y por toda la enseñanza sobre la Precipitación, este libro es fundamental para todo estudiante de la Luz."
5,Lectura seria para lectores serios,"Este libro constituye parte de esa ""lectura seria para lectores serios"" descargada por los mismísimos Elohim por conducto de Geraldine Innocente (de manera paralela a lo que hicieron los Arcángeles al mismo tiempo y por el mismo conducto).Los Elohim, siendo los Constructores del Universo, nos dan en este libro la oportunidad de darle una mirada a cómo razonan, actúan y trabajan los ""chicos grandes"" en esa actividad que tanto hace soñar a cuántos: La precipitación de lo inmanifiesto a lo manifiesto. Para nada una actividad impulsiva ni irreflexiva como verá quien lea este libro!"
3,"Great tunes, depressing songs","I was quite disappointed in the songs on this album. I'm used to the band giving me a mix of traditional Scottish and Irish songs, along with some great tunes. Well the tunes are here and they're wonderful altho a bit lacking on the 'pipes. The songs on the other hand are uniformly depressing. Way too political for my taste. Every one is a protest song of some sort, lamenting every thing from slavery to the Iraq war. Now I don't mind a song or two like that per album but this is way too much. I hope the band got all the politic out of their system with this one and can get back to the basics with the next one."
3,Paint by numbers,Spaces too small for 62 year old eyes. Lines and numbers are very light and hard to read. I use a magnifying glass to paint. My next paint by numbers will have to have bigger spaces and be easier to read. However I do enjoy to continue working on it but cannot work on it for long periods. Completed the painting and I like the results.
5,Some experience suggested,"I received this painting as a Christmas gift. I am enjoying the journey of seeing it come to life. I do recommend that you have at least some basic knowledge of painting. Also don't be afraid to make it your ""own"" by blending and shading. Your painting does not have to look exactly like the one on the box. I purchased a separate set of brushes to do the fine detailing. The one brush that comes with the kit is very basic. Shading brushes can also be purchased separately as well as a palette for blending colors which is required for several of the details.UPDATE: I completed this painting and it is STUNNING! I am incredibly pleased and surprised. I bought a mat and frame with glass and have it hanging in my living room. YES, it is that beautiful. I highly recommend this painting."
5,"Gardin Bluebirds, paint by number",Great product and fast shipping. The painting is already completed and ready to be framed.
5,perfect for my 14 yr old,"The colors are just as pictured and it looks lifelike when finished. She was pleased with herself when it was complete. Other companies in our experience haven't always had realistic colors that blend well, but we will always buy paint kits from Dimensions because the painting turns out like the picture on the box."
5,Lovely,"This is a large and somewhat complicated kit, but it was fun to paint. I changed the black areas at the bottom of the painting to a rather dark blue and liked the result better. I didn't intend to hang this, but the completed painting turned out so pretty that I framed it and hung it. If there is one drawback it would be that the painting isn't a standard size, so standard size frames and mats don't work with it."
5,The Best Detailed Study of Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira.,"This is the 1st detailed study of Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapira, Rebbe of the Warsaw Ghetto. The book illuminates the real issues of faith and doubt in the Holocaust. Unlike most books, which were written AFTER the Shoah and by people who were NOT there, the Eish Kodesh was written and influenced by the Ghetto. Beautiful retelling of how Rabbi Shapira's ideas changed dramatically by the Shoah. THE HOLY FIRE is a great book for how to understand how bad things happen to good people.Understandability............*****Flow_of_Text..................**** Page_Format..................***** Historical_Accuracy..........*****Chapter_System..............**** BOOK*IN*ITSELF.............#####"
5,"Great Item Great price, worth every penny","I bought this charger at Costco a few years back with 6 AA and 2 AAA batteries included. The cells I recieved were from Japan so no complaints here. They are still going strong in my Canon A80, they take about 500+ pictures before going low and even more pictures if I use the flash less. They last as long as when I first bought them and the triple A's are perfect for my remote, it lasts forever it seems, must be at least 2 years since I charged the AAAs. Overall I thought it was a great bargain at 24.99, charges extremely quick, never goes hot, lightweight, stylish... no complaints here."
3,Ah: The Healing Voice,"Service was great, CD is as described. I was disappointed that there was a large sticker with Peanuts characters on the CD cover that I cannot remove. There is no plastic case, so the sticker is affixed right onto the paper. Wish I had been told about it"
2,"no english subtitle, not suitable for english-speaking audience at all","Performance was great. But without subtitle, even a Chinese-speaker can barely understand what they're saying, not to mention English speakers! Disappointing. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew."
5,The ancient Romans created a provocative architecture.,MacDonald/Pinto assert that Hadrian forged a new and innovative architectural system which integrated buildings with nature and human use. Hadrian's goal was to create an arrangement of buildings which were functional and yet challenged the intellect to contemplate the unseen world. They also make a very strong case for the pervasive influence which this complex villa has had on archtecture from ancient times to the present. This book makes one realize that Roman architecture is indeed relevant to the present.
3,Continuation of the author's PhD disertation.,"A little too dry and academic to be called gripping, it is still an interesting read about one of the great monuments and a building that has become part of the nations psyche. Also for a book on the design and creation of the memorial, I thought it was lacking in pictures documenting the building of the actual memorial. It has some, but I was hoping for more."
5,WAY COOL!,"This book is a must read for Animorph's fans! The Animorphs use their famous cockroach morph to find the Kandroma, the miniture version of the Yeerk's home sun. But when they get there, a Taxxon makes them his lunch! Just in time, an Elimist saves them and gives them a choice: they can stay on Earth and fight the Yeerks, or leave Earth and form a whole new colony of humans. Before long, the vote is two against two, and Rachel has the deciding vote. But she thinks something is going on here. And when she investigates deeper, she finds out that the Elimist is actually helping them fight...."
3,A very entertaining book,This book is good and it is a lot like the others. That's the problem. Attacking the yeerk poole has gotten kind of old. It still can have you begging for more but not like the first time around. If you havn't read it you should. Because it is good . But don't expect to not be wondering how many times the series is going to reapeat it's self.
4,Good Book,"In this book, the Animorphs meet the Elemist and are told the human race is doomed. He offers to bring them and their families to a new planet very much like earth. But will the Animorphs accept the offer...or decline it? In this book Rachel gets he grizzly bear morph"
3,The Animorphs are trying to destroy the Kandrona.,This book wasn`t bad.I do not like any of the Animorphs but I think the books are fine. I`ve only red five Animorph books and up to now my favorite one is The Invasion.
4,Don't mess with the Bear!!,"I found this book to be one of the best. I mean really! Rachel's my favorite character, and she is adventurous. Like me! After sneaking into the Yeerk pool, the Animorphs meet an Elimist. The Elimist gives them a choise, to stay on Earth and fight the Yeerks. Or to go to another PLANET! What do they choose?"
5,Leave the Fight?,"This is one of the best animorphs series book. I loved it because it introduces one of my favorite characters: the Ellimist. Rachel is stressed. Atop of having to fighting the evil mind-controlling yeerks by turning into animals, her father is going to move away and wants her to come with him. A chance for a normal life. But she can't leave now. Her friends have found an entrance to a yeerk pool where the slugs rest each three days. They go inside as roaches and are almost swallowed by a taxxon (a controlled spacial worm) when time stops. A strange man tells them that he can take them to another planet along with some loved ones where the human race can reproduce. Some have made their decision. Will the fight be abandoned?"
5,A bear of a book!,"This is #7 Animorphs, And it is COOL!! A real page turner. Get the book! It is sooooo cool! and I'm not telling you one bit of info because it'll mess up the effect.ps. if you want to talk to me about the books, send me instructions to get to a chat line. This life of mine is kinda lonely"
5,The entire series is wonderful; appeals to kids and adults,"I have read all 7 of the books in the series to my seven-year old grandson, and he loves them. When he is with his mother in Florida, during the summer, I make tapes which I send to him, so that he can keep up with the action of the Animorphs. I just sent the tape of the first Megamorph book, and we are both waiting for No. 8 to come out"
2,kind of boring,"got this hoping to get my young sons interested in learning the game... but, it's really boring for them. it's all accurate and the techniques that it teaches are important - but my kids tuned out as soon as it started.there is one with a cartoon mit, ball and bat that has little songs (you'll hate them but your kids will love them) and short scenes that can hold the kids' attention. that one played non-stop in my car this summer. I'd suggest it for kids under 7. it's called Littlest Leaguers Learn to Play Baseball -The Littlest Leaguers: Learn to Play Baseball"
4,Good Stylus and Cartridge,"If you've been using Stanton 500's or anything similar ($20-$30), you'll think this was perfection. But if you're an audiophile used to Grados, this'll be... well now to be honest it isn't bad but it's far from the ideal sound. I picked this one up because it's got a good sound, good anti-skip, won't burn out my records and while I'm not a fan of abusing my vinyls (scratching, etc.), this one was designed to handle it so you've got that option to if you want. In short, it's not bad at all.Keep in mind though that this doesn't come with a headshell. Has screws, etc. but no headshell."
5,Swept Away Stories-Secret in Scotland,"This book is an absolute delight. The story itself is engaging and entertaining, and the links allow children to explore beyond the boundaries of the book itself. This will keep a child entertained for hours."
3,Pull Buoy review,"This pull buoy absorbs some water after use, so if you're putting it in your gym bag after using it, expect it to get other items in the bag wet."
1,PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS CD.,"This cd/album is one that was originally released in the 1980's...and the material is compiled of tracs that must've been sitting around one of the older...smaller record company's shelves(like demo's).I'm quite familiar w/ the person that put this album together...and even w/ this being the second time he's releasing it,he's never given one penny to the heirs of Jesse Belvin's Estate.Enough was taken from my father when he was alive...and this guy ""I guess"" thinks it's still 1950...when it was common place to steal royalties from an artist.Most Sincerely,Jesse Belvin Jr."
5,Love this book,This is a wonderful devotional book written by Craig Barnes. His insight is very inspirational. There are two of these books which are easy reads and very biblically based.
3,A Good Guide Book,"This is a good guide book for walking around Boston and trying to understand some history behind the buildings. Too many buildings are covered, old and new buildings together. The general information about the construction date, architectural style is provided but not in detail. It is so grouped that it makes it easy to walk around the town and see good number of buildings in the neighbourhood. Information is not very detailed, State Haouse is described in two pages or so, other buildings in one short paragraph, just to give general idea about the architecture and history of the city. I found it more handy than other available books for it covers a lot and it has walker friendly sequencing."
4,Good brand history book,Book about passion for cars and engineering but not only. Gives a good political and historical perspective about european small industries after the ww2.
5,ALLTIME GREAT,"THIS IS AN ALL TIME GREAT BLUES PRODUCTION!!LOVE IT, LIVE IT, WEAR IT OUT AT PARTIES!!"
3,Big & Little Company,"The product it self is fine, it is the way it was packed I had a problem with. The package was bent in half and shoved into a smaller box. When I received the makers the were open in the box, I then emailed the shipper right away. That was almost a month ago. They never got back to me. One of the markers were dry and this was to be part of a Christmas present for my daughter. I will never use the Big & Little Company again!"
3,Cliff 1970,"This album released in 1970 unfortunately suffers from the fact that the recordings made for the album are spread over three years which highlights the difference in his voice and gives the album an uneasy feel as if the tracks were just put together without any thought or direction he does however sing songs written by many famous songwriters including Neil Diamond, Neil Sedaka and Sonny Bono. Highlights include The Girl Can't Help It and Don't Let Tonight Ever End."
5,A Wonderful Freshman Release,I thoroughly enjoy this freshman release from Steve Perry. It takes me back to when music was the best: The '80's.
5,Best Fearless Book,"This is the best FEARLESS book, Gaia is changing, for the worse, and the reader becomes very very worried that she will convert to the dark side of Loki and his ""connections"". At the end, their is a really swweet part between her and Ed. It kills me its so sweet. i just keep reading pages 202-204 over and over again!"
5,a fearless breakthrough!,"I love all the fearless books even though there are a few problems like the love triangle. But this book is by far the most important one. Gaia realizes that violence isn't the solution to every problem, and that she( like a normal human being), needs people, including ED.This is quite a breakthrough especially since we usually see Gaia having so much strength and will power. THis is a book in the series that should DEFINATELY be read."
5,Blood,Excellent book. I love the character development in thisseries. Every book teaches you a little more about everyone and theirmotivations. The story flows well and is very believable. I'm certainly ready for the next one to come out.
1,Missing song,I purchased this item specifically for the How Great Thou Art song byMichael Tait. It even shows this artist on the cover and lists the song on the track description but when I got the CD there that song was missing and was deleted from the cover listing. What happened?
3,How Great Thou Art by Tait is NOT ON THIS ALBUM,"How Great Thou Art by Tait is NOT ON THIS ALBUM!!!!!I wish I'd taken time to read the other reviews. I purchased this album ONLY because it listed Tait's version of ""How Great Thou Art"" as a song on the album.The other songs are o.k., but I'd already purchased a couple of the other songs as MP3 Downloads from Amazon. VERY Disappointed. I do not understand why Amazon has not removed the song from the listings on this album. Very misleading."
2,Not Impressed,Where did all the bad reviews go? When I bought this product one group of the people loved it because of the fact that things do not burn if your oven has certain kinds of heating problems (which many ovens do) and another group complained about the fact that the pan did not hold its shape. Well after having the pan for a while stuff cooks evenly and the pan warps. I will continue to use it but I will also be getting more sheets of another kind.
1,this item was damaged so bad I will never be able to use it,"This one stated new but it was damaged so bad I will never be able to bake cookies on but one side of this sheet, not fair to me"
5,The best!,"The first pair wore out..the replacement are equally wonderful.With teflon sheets, never a sticking or over browning . I can do a full recipe of original Toll House cookies in less than an hour, start to finish baking."
3,Should have read description,"I thought that I was getting 2 sheets based on the picture and that is my fault, I did not read the description carefully. If you are looking for this pan they have one for sell that is $4 more but you get 2 and a small cookbook. I wish I would have read more carefully, this is not a review on the product itself just to let everyone know that you can get more for your money if you look more carefully, like I wish I had."
2,Contrived,"Trying oh, so very hard to be what it claims to be, and failing utterly. It's synth- and reverb-heavy, with muddy, off-tempo vocals and overwrought and/or distracting invocations. Sensuality requires subtlety, and the sacred needs heart - it has none of either. I give it two stars for the nice tabla work; otherwise, this is uninspired, poorly produced house music hiding behind the Halloween Superstore version of a gypsy veil."
1,cheezy,"i give this cd one star for the drumming being adequate. the rest is very synthesized and just not enough for me. i think the drums might be the only ""real"" instrument on the album. the rest is cheesy synthesizer stuff. i was dissapointed."
5,"Music for the mind, Sound for the soul","A blend of Enigma and William Orbit with a dash of Pure Moods, it carries me along on a soothing ride of musical introspection. If you enjoy music of the world that creates a sense of mystery this sound will be pleasing to your ears. Beneath the Veil has a lovely joy to it that has a rhythm you will want to hear again and again.It's not a new press - 1997 - but the music sounds new each time I hear it. It is seductive and wonderful for intimate moods. I have shared this music with several friends who each enjoy it as much as I do, and friends are the toughest critics."
2,blood pressure cuff,This blood pressure cuff was still way too small for my arm. Can't understand why they can't make them bigger like they do at the doctor's office.
4,crunch crunch crunch squeal squeal squonk,"RoboChanMan, Strugglediver (Ground Fault, 2000)Strugglediver, RoboChanMan's (as far as I have been able to discern) second disc, pretty much picks up where Remote Control Militia left off. Insanely loud distorted static with a tone running through it here and there and Yasushi Tahara contributing insane, wordless howling every once in a while. The album opens with two long (sixteen minute and twelve minute) tracks, lending it a structure that RCM lacked right off the bat; all of the pieces here, in fact, are longer and more structured than the stuff on the first disc. The lengths of the pieces alone give the disc a greater sense of wholeness than the last one had, which makes the material seem stronger overall. The tracks still fall all over the map, but they don't shift gears quite as quickly. Quite pretty. ****"
3,The development of warfare from medieval times.,"This is a good read for those wanting to know how warfare developed. Since Europe controlled most of the land mass of the world at some points, the development of warfare worldwide can be linked with what happened in Europe. War in medieval times was more of a local affair. The development of nation states changed where war became one of merchants and mercenaries. The French Revolution forced war to become revolutionary. Nationalism focused war towards the goals of the nation.This is a short read on the development of warfare. I would not rate this book for everybody. It does give the history of warfare in simple to understand terms."
4,Misconceptions,"Ok, I have / use one of these & have to comment on the other reviews: #1 - The state of CA 'warning' is due to the presence of lead in the brass; nothing more / nothing less. Most brass fittings. valves, etc. contain a nominal amount of lead as it greatly assists in the casting & machining of parts in the manufacturing process. I'd venture a guess that you would have to drink 14 quadzillion gallons of water that had passed thru one of these regulators before you would accumulate even a detectable amount of lead in your blood. If you live in CA, you have my sympathies. #2 - Correct me if I am wrong, but it is my understanding that you set these valves under static load; that is inline with the hose shut off ! That is to say once you open the hose, valve, etc, the pressure reading is going to drop off to zero. Shut off the flow & it returns to your set point which coincidentally, is the pressure the regulator is allowing to pass through. That said, it does what it is supposed to do !"
4,Works great.,Works great. Much cheaper that the more know name brand. I would recommend this regulator to anyone looking for this type of product.
2,Drips,"I was unable to get this to stop dripping, even with vise grips. It is a bit disappointing. Very nice design otherwise."
2,3/4 to 3/8 th's,Does what I wanted except with the minimal flow through I'm stalled.Looking for something else now.Bob
1,Causes Cancer?,"I was surprised upon receiving this product to find a note inside the plastic clamshell packaging stating: ""WARNING: This Product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""Yeah, like I'm going to use this for my organic garden irrigation now.But I wanted to try it anyway to see if it worked, so I put on some gloves to avoid getting the oily residue that coated the device onto my hands and hooked it up. And it didn't work. Inlet pressure is 50 psi, and I set the device to 25 PSI. When the water came on, I got a high pressure spike, followed by very little flow at all. It didn't seem to matter what I set the pressure to, it just didn't work. So I replaced it with a $4.50 non-adjustable 25 PSI pressure reducer that I got from the home supply store and that worked just fine. Without oily carcinogen residue. This piece of junk is going right back."
1,one star for POOR SERVICE but good product,"My 2 yr old terrier mix has been eating this food since she was a puppy. She loves it & we love it because since switching over to this her skin is no longer pink and itchy! HOWEVER THIS SELLER IS TERRIBLE....Placed order for ""just a wee bit"" dog food. In-stock item was estimated to be delivered a week later. Well a week later when I was supposed to have received my order I instead received an email from amazon stating they could not give me tracking info because seller had not confirmed that the item had yet been shipped! I contacted seller asking when I would be receiving the order and they did not reply! Meanwhile I ran out of my dogs food and I had to drive all around town looking for a store that carried this brand! (hard to find in my area, which is why I usually order online...usually through amazon from ProbioticSmart, but I tried to save a few bucks with PetcareRx...never again"
4,kids scary movie,"The kids liked this one a lot. Only one part really spooked them. If you have kids around the 1st thru 6th grades, that's about the age range on this one."
3,barbara spear,barbara spear is an enthusiastic author and deserves much crdit for her success w/ corvette seatbelts. this book brought me closer to my family and wearing seatbelts in my corvette.
2,Tedious,"I tried reading this book twice but it was such a waste of energy that I had to give up or lose my mind.At least the second time I persisted until chapter 21, much longer than the first try which was a mere 2 chapters."
3,Good book but needs more detail,I really enjoyed this book but I really would have liked a lot more information about specific incidents. There were several times that only two or three lines were dedicated to incidents that could have been 2 or 3 pages. I hope he writes another more detailed book...because I would buy it!
2,Dissapointing,"This was disappointing. It's only 180 pages, and it's not a full sized book. It reads like a Cliff Notes of Purdue basketball history under Keady. I remember most of the big games (at Purdue) that Keady discusses in the book, but he adds little that I didn't already know. The whole thing feels rushed, like they were way behind deadline and had to get it done, or maybe his heart wasn't really into the project in the first place."
5,"Ladies & Gentlemen, Boys & Girls, Children Of All Ages...","EncycRAWpedia is a great resource for people of any age who enjoy the WWF! Through the use of audio and video clips, the user is able to hear from their favorite superstar or view the greatest moments from Monday night RAW. I can't wait for Volume 2!"
5,The best WWF CD-ROM available!,"This CD-ROM is fantastic....the videos running in the Titan Tron was an excellent idea. I really loved that. Backgrounds are great too. I think the 'soundbites' could have been eliminated from the CD though, and extra videos would have taken their place. The screensavers are fine too.The sounds going in each menu are good..and the introduction with Kane kicks ass. Nice animation there. Overall a great product, with some of the best RAW Is WAR video clips you could think of."
5,One of the greatest boxed sets ever issued in country music,"This 2 CD boxed set of George's greatest hits is one of those collections to listen to no matter what mood you are in. The 1st CD covers his early years with many of his biggest hits from those years such as ""White Lightning,"" ""Why Baby Why,"" ""Window Up Above,"" all the way to his earliest hits for Epic Records. The second CD of this boxed set features many of his biggest hits on Epic Records such as ""He Stopped Loving Her Today,"" ""Sill Doin' Time,"" ""Same Ol' Me,"" ""I Always Get Lucky With You"" and more. The only collection that spans many of the labels he has recorded for and this set has 44 of his biggest hits."
1,BEWARE! (of remakes),"I admit that I'm probably a much less rabid George Jones fan than most of the people who have contributed reviews here. I bought this collection mainly for 2 songs -- ""The Race is On"" and ""Good Year for the Roses"". You can imagine my disappointment when I played ""Race"" and it was either a re-make or just re-mixed terribly with the vocals turned up so loud, they drown out the music! Then, I listened to ""Good Year"" and discovered to my horror that it was a complete re-make! What the hell? I don't want to hear a re-made version -- I, like almost everyone in their right minds would, want to hear the original versions! I thought this was common knowledge! C'mon! This is ridiculous!"
5,FIVE STARS AREN'T ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!,"Jones is the greatest singer of any genre of music, and this proves it right here. All his essential collector hits are right in this box. For someone new to his music who may not be able to find some of his older albums, this is perfect. I can listen to this boxed set over and over and over........"
5,An excellent guide for the starter and professional alike,"Cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria is a little known form of project management. The subject matter suffers from being very dry and complex. What this book does is to give clear knowledge whilst managing to keep the reader interested as well. The book covers the history of the techniques involved as well as the day-to-day application of them. This format serves to explain the method and the rationale behind the method. All avenues are explored and the book is generic enough to apply to any and all projects.A well written, well informed guide to one of the most misunderstood and misused management tools."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a book of activities to liven up math. Instead, it is just a book of worksheets. Mostly problems where the learner uses the answer in a crossword, wordsearch, or some other type of puzzle. I'm looking for activities to work with students in groups of 3-5. Projects or activities to give us a break from lecture and homework. This is definitely not it. I was led to believe this book was for 6-12, but I would rate it for 6-8."
1,Viking CompactFlash is NOT compatible with HP Jornada 720!,Contrary to the listing on Amazon.com Viking CompactFlash cards are NOT compatible with the HP Jornada 720. (I got this info from both HP and Viking)Buyer beware...
1,"If it remembers, one wonders what and where.","The product is shipped with a notice stating that installation instructions are to be seen on Viking's web site which, for me, has thus far failed to load."
5,A little secret,All compact flash memory brands are basically the same. As best I can tell they are made in 3 factories in jakarta indonesia sub contract. I would therefore buy based on price only
5,Jolie- The World's Greatest Entertainer,"The is a great book about one the greatest personalities of the Twentith century. The books provides the reader with a concise biography of this entertainer. Jolson is a forgotten star of showbusiness who was the first super-star of the century. You will find listings of Jolson books, articles, and songs. It provides the reader many sources of research about Jolson. Along with Herbert Goldman's definitive biography of Jolie, this book is a terrific and scholarly read. I have read many articles and books about Jolson and I rank this one the best. If you want to learn about one of the greatest entertainers of all-time, (also one of the most misunderstood), please get this book. Once you learn about Jolson, you become a fan for life. Check out his wonderful Lp's and CD's and enjoy his music!"
2,Badly needs updating,"Includes now defunct restaurants like Cafe Azul in McMinnville, OR (now moved to Portland); Heathman Grill, Avalon, Augustine's-- all closed. Review of Tina's doesn't remark on new building. Stellar new places like Macmenamins Hotel Oregon and Joel Palmer House not included. Spiffy new Heathman Lodge in Vamncouver, WA not included. OK, so the devil is in the details, but this is one OLD travel companion. Update it, or stop selling it."
1,Not a Documentary,"This page seems to describe the video as being a documentary about meth and what one man went through. It is not that at all. It is one man talking about meth in front of a school for over an hour. No video clips, other speakers, or any scientific information. Not recommended if you are looking for information on meth or something interesting to watch."
3,General knowledge,"Not a well written book and contains very general information about money laundering that most people are already aware of such as off-shore banking. It is short on specifics, and long on trying to relate the author's experiences in the field. A bit boring."
3,a notable filmmaker,"T Cozarinsky, a notable filmmaker brings us a mysterious and breathtaking collection of stories that belong to a great Argentine cosmopolitan tradition: they tell of the uprooted exile who settles in a strange but proud land and looks back longingly at the Europe of his past. Just as in his past collection, Cozarinsky creates a mystical world, populated by writers, lovers, scholars, artists, and dreamers."
5,This is geat homeschool material,"I read this for my homeschooling and it is very well portrayed. Characters are given a very fair amount of credit. There is allot of pony express books out there and I have to say this one is the most: Accurate(to my knowledge), exiting, well written, Keep you interested all around good book. This man is a wonder with writing. You never get board. This is written so well, it sounds like being a pony express rider was like today being a NASCAR driver. Well I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who is wanting to know more about the ""Pony express"" or for school (naturally)."
3,"Solid Overview, Just Not As Expected","While this book provides a solid insight into the routes and hardships of the Pony Express, I was hoping for more insight into the riders and their lives together. It is a quick and easy read."
1,Inaccurate and not useful,"Yes, the premise is good. Unfortunately, I just don't have any trust for the data. For example, they list Babson College as in Maryland, but it is in Boston. So Babson repeatedly fails to appear in any list that mentions Boston-area schools. And they list Amherst College, although it isn't a business school!There is no overall list of the schools considered for the rankings, or a list of when the data was acquired, or a list of how to contact any of the schools.Don't waste your money on this book."
4,Excellent work,"I have been an Erasure fan since the late '80's, and I have always said that each album they put out is better than the last both in terms of lyrics and music. Nightbird was a plateau, I believe, but still good. This cd takes a few listens to get used to. Once you have done that, you hear the songs in a different light. The first listen is so unexpected, it can throw off even a die hard fan like myself. Give it a chance and it will grow on you. There are a few songs on here that even I can't get used to but overall, it's just Erasure showing their talent again. Also, for some reviewers below, please don't hate the song selections. They have two or three greatest hits albums already, one live, why would they want to do that again?"
2,"Great concept, but arrangements are too sparse","I am huge Erasure fan, but this was a bit of a disappointment. I have loved Erasure's previous use of acoustic instruments (my favorites are ""My Heart . . . So Blue (orchestral)"" from the Two-Ring Circus and ""Don't Suppose"" from the B-side of Chains of Love). Here, however, the arrangements all sound like they need about three more instruments to fill things out. The biggest problem is that there is no percussion to speak of, which makes the songs sound way too mellow and lifeless. A drum kit with some delicate cymbals would have done wonders.That said, if you are a fan, you will probably find two or three songs that have enough of a new twist here to make this worth picking up. ""Stay With Me"" is pretty and ""Rock Me Gently"" works well as a shorter, simpler song."
2,Just plain boring,"I've tried to make it through the album twice and I'm bored to tears with these songs. Maybe it will sound better on a cold rainy day. I so wanted to enjoy this album, but can't seem to get into the versions of these songs. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but a die-hard fan."
4,Union Street Review,"As a die hard Erasure fan, I have to admit that this isn't Erasure's best album but definitely contains exciting renditions of some of the band's forgotten songs. Someone that may not like one of the original songs from Union Street in the style it was originally written, may find a new love for the remade acoustic version. I would highly recommend the album."
3,Great accoustic album,"I`ve been a true Erasure fan since the release of The Innocents, I really love their synth-pop so it was quite odd for me to listen old known songs in dobro and steel guitar. However the songs and Andy`s voice (as always) sounds incredible. The songs included could be not as popular as others but lyrics are beatiful.My favorites are Alien, Tenderest Moments, and Home"
1,over inflected vocals are cringing to the ears,"This boring mess just made me put on the originals - which are SO GREAT. A pointless release. Another reviewer knocked the duos's last release ""Nightbird"" - however I found that the most refreshing recording they had done in ages. This feels like a contractual obligation and sounds like how an unsalted saltine with generic peanut butter would taste. Go for the originals."
2,my worst fears come true,"I've been Erasure's biggest fan from their very beginning, and have everything they have ever released, so it was with much disappointment that I evaluated Union Street. As an accomplished and trained musician and someone who considers Erasure the best band in the world, bar none, the new album absolutely, positively stinks! And I was really afraid of this. If you are an Erasure fan in any way, do not buy this record - there is not even one song worth listening to - frankly, it's embarrassing and it may be the one and only Erasure album that I get rid."
4,True Savannah Bong,"This is another adventurous and inspired release from an unusually enjoyable band. I agree with the other reviewers who suggest that to fully enjoy Erasure, one must do so with all their electronic glory; but I appreciate a band that is constantly willing to rework the formulas and deliver surprises to their audience - especially when the songs are so good in so many formats.As they did so adeptly in their recent live show at Lakewood Theater in Dallas - even going beyond this song selection and into other singles performed in this same ""acoustic"" touch - they prove to be a thoroughly enjoyable act, despite life's monumental hurdles they have overcome.The songs are solid and have stood the test of time and guitars!"
5,Great little mouse !,"I purchased this little mouse to go along with a pink netbook that I got for my birthday this past June. I love it. It matches my netbook perfectly too. I like that it is so small, it fits in my netbook bag well.But it isn't so small that a man couldn't us it. My 29 year old son has been using it while adding programs on my new netbook and he hasn't had a bit of trouble.I have been showing it to everyone. They are always wowed by it when I press the sides and the little door opens where the USB receiver is stored ..... first thing they say, WOW, where did you get that.Oh yeah .... it works Great too. I love it."
5,Fantastic Product. Small and compact.,"This mouse is easy to use, will work in any computer, and is compact enough to carry around with me. Plus, the pink color and the cause are great. I would highly recommend this product."
3,Cute but too small,My hand hurt after using it for only a few minutes and I would say I have average-sized hands.
5,Love it!,I love using this mouse the size great for on the go with my laptop. My daughter loved mine so much that I have brought her one for her new laptop for her birthdayKensington Si750m LE Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse- Go Red Edition in Pink. Could not find this type in the local stores. But found it on Amazon!
1,I hate it,"The back opens at the slightest touch. I am constantly fighting with the mouse and are looking for a much better replacement. The cursor skips and jumps all over the place. It worked great the first couple of months and thought I had a great mouse, after that, it started to act up and replacing the batteries (rechargeable) has not helped the situation. I hate this mouse and I'm glad I bought it on sale for $15.00 but I still feel it was a waste of money."
5,The best i have seen,"I have tried a dozen screen guards, some of them shine a lot, some of them are not as clear as they promise, some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble. This makes its way through all that problems. Well on the other hand it does have a catch1. Finger print magnet2. The price - THAT PRICE FOR ONE!!!And yea the best part is its static not gum, and its washable.."
1,"Dust magnet, waste of money","This is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen. I attempted 4 times, washing the back thoroughly between each attempt, cleaning the Cingular screen with a new lens cloth. Once specks of dust touch the adhesive they're there for good and the protector is ruined. I gave up because I was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than I was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid! Save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in."
1,Caveat emptor,"This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem. If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality, try Clarivue."
1,Poor Quality Product,Just bought this screen protector for my new 8525 and the small tab peel that comes with the screen protector sticker to help you align it to your phone screen did not come off properly and left the adhesive/glue residue on the screen. i had to take it off and try to wash it off with soap and water and still had difficult time. I may have had a bad qulity sticker so I just wrote boxwave to send me a new one since I was not happy with the one I recieved.
1,More anti Castro propaganda,"Over the top is an understatement for this book! Author wants us to believe that Castro has been behind every act of terror directed against the USA since the 1950's. If he hates us, (actually it is more correct to say, he might hate our government) it is because of the continuing embargo against his country.The man is nothing less than a saint! Open your eyes people, there are actually leaders in the world who honor their commitments to the people of their country and he is one of them."
4,"Bach, true Bach","A great interpretation of J.S. Bach, a little dry, a litte cerebral, very accurate to the period in both style and technique, and great to listen to. This is music of the mind that sometimes touches the heart.Tony Trethowan"
3,recorded at very loud level,"While there is nothing wrong with the performance, it's not my favorite. But that's just my opinion.The reason of my rating and my biggest gripe is the volume. I think they recorded this at the loudest level possible leaving no room for dynamics. I have this loaded on my portable music player and out of hundreds of recordings, I have to turn the volume down for this.A trend that is occurring in the music industry is to max out the loudness of a recording so that it sounds good in non ideal conditions. The result is that dynamics (volume) is lost (i.e. nuances between soft and loud). The whole CD sounds like it's being pounded. Look up ""loudness war"" on wikipedia ([...]). Unfortunately the CD falls victim to that war."
4,An interesting view of quantum theory and mind,"When read along with Herbert's previous book, Quantum Reality, this text makes a good case for invoking quantum physics to explain the relation of mind and matter and also in explaining some of the more convincing experiments in parapsychology (effects of consciousness on random number generators) which suggest a non-locality of mind. If more people took such ideas seriously and devoted time and research to them, understanding of the mind and a true theory of consciousness might be forthcoming."
3,The Emperor has no Clothes,"I read this book as a result of a blog discussion by Rudy Rucker who was favorable to the idea of a quantum description of the mind as expressed in this book. The book covers some quantum theory, but the link to the mind is so tenuous it is almost non-existent. Even some of the experiments described, whose results could be interpreted very differently, have now been disproved. The result is that a quantum explanation for thought is at best, not even close to being a useful hypothesis, at worst just not required as a replacement for more ""prosaic"" biological explanations.Roger Penrose might have kick started this as a popular idea, but Herbert's book doesn't really add to the discussion by shedding any useful light on it."
2,Much better books are available,"I read this over a few hours one weekend.I must say that this book promises more than it can deliver.In attempting to cover a huge concept,much of the text is rather superficial and diffuse,somewhat like the electron cloud readers of such books are familiar with.However,unlike the electron cloud, the diffuseness does not contribute to the mystique and there are a number of better treatises available.I did read of a couple of experiments I had not heard about elsewhere but otherwise was quite unimpressed."
5,"Excellent, high-quality memory card.",The Viking 32 MB SmartMedia memory card is an excellent quality card that works as promised. Its suppliers deliver my orders at the speed of lightening or e-mail. I've used the Viking SmartMedia cards exclusively for the last two years without a single problem. The photos are clear. I have no problem retrieving them off the card. My Olympus Digital 3.0 MP Camera D550 records about 350 photos at 640X480 resolution. The Viking price on Amazon.com is the best on the market.
3,Was Expensive But Serves Well,"I had bought this 32 MB card way back in 2002. At that time such cards were very expensive. Added to that I had ordered a camera with this card which Amazon did not ship!! So I had yo keep the card unused till I could buy a compatible camera from them.The card is still serving me well, no complaints so far!"
4,good deal...,This does it's job at a good price!.... A good deal for everyone since it is so small and light.
1,Let the buyer beware!,"This product is listed as compatible with my camera, an Olympus D-340R, in several locations on the Amazon website. However, after purchasing the card and attempting, unsuccessfully, to format it in my camera, I found by searching further (the Viking site) that the 32MB card requires some type of Olympus upgrade to be usable. The message is: Let the buyer beware!"
4,If you have hot flashes...,"...or night sweats, this helps! It doesn't get rid of all of them, but it is by far the most effective product I've used. (Do some research on vitamins C and E - those help, as well.)"
1,disappointment doesn't begin to describe,be wary of purchasing this router bit - the shaft which mounts in the router chuck is extremely short and appears to be a safety hazard to me - I really don't think the shaft is long enough for the chuck to hold the bit - how the bit performs I don't know - saw the length of the shaft and returned it immediately
4,Davenport Rolls On,"I believe this is the 6th book in the Prey series with Lucas Davenport. As with the others leading up to it, Sandford keeps it fast paced throughout and builds all of his characters, including the continual development of Davenport. The story itself has the expected twists and turns, some humor and this particular novel carries with it plenty of brutally violent acts by the killer. Along the way, Davenport encounters side issues on his job and in his life. Makes this escapism type of novels a little more real by recognizing that our day-to-day lives are three dimensional. A great read!"
3,Another good Prey-novel,"This Prey-novel, Night Prey, is not the best I have read. But it is not a bad book, not at all. Lucas Davenport is back on the force, mostly working behind the scenes. In Night Prey he is on a hunt for a serial killer who preys on lonely women with average looks, women who nobody'll notice. The killer falls in love with a business woman, and starts stalking her. She is unaware of him, and it is not until the last part of the book she discovers what's going on, and then it is almost too late. Davenport also has to deal with a dying state-police woman, who has one goal in her life, before she dies: to catch this serial killer. The character-descriptions are not as well developed in this book as they have been in other John Sandford novels, but nevertheless, Night Prey is a fast read and it will keep you entertained while reading. It is not nail-biting exciting though, something I missed with this one."
4,Movie,I am reading this book and there are parts of the plot that are very familiar. Is there a movie that is based on this book or a book that is similar? The part where the deaf students remember the guy's license plate number sticks out. I think I either read the same thing in a book or saw it in a movie. Did it seem familiar to anyone else?
5,Night Prey,"John Sandford's Lucas Davenport combines the qualities of being a hero with ample evidence of human frailty. No superhero like many of the current action heroes in literature, Davenport, nonetheless, gets the job done mixing strength, charm, and intelligence. I look forward to continuing my trip down the booklist."
3,abridgement,"I don't like abridgements generally and this was mutilated. I don't have eleven more words, I like to be succinct"
3,NIGHT PREY,In this 6th book I enjoyed the dialogue the most. The killer was sick. The storyline was ok but I wouldn't read this book again. I don't know when I will read the next book because this series is not holding my interest.
5,i have read all the books in this series,i read all the books in the series and i coulnt wait to see a new one out. i absolutely love john sanford as a writter i think he is better than any other authur in his field. if you like suspence and love mind games these are the book for you. i promise that once you start you won't stop until you have read them all. these books are great because you don't have to read them in order but the characters build on to them selves in each book. he is the best!!!!!
1,Huh?,I don't get it. I heard so much praise for Sandford novels that I was looking forward to discovering a new author. It was like reading a 'Hunter' episode..it was sooo boring. This book lacked everything! It had no character development and was extremely predictable and unimaginative. I don't like to be so harsh with a review but I cannot understand the accolades.
1,So Many Errors,"This book has so many spelling errors, it seriously detracts from the story.Many single words are spelled as two words. For two examples, pleasure it written as plea sure and pilot is written as pi lot. This is not an occasional mistake, but every time you come across the words above.Then you run into what should be two separate words combined into one word. For example, a long becomes along.This book needed some serious proofreading before publishing."
4,All Davenport mysteries are very good reads.,The stories capture the reader's interest immediately. Each book has a small reference to the stories before which means you can read as a stand alone or continue the life experiences of Davenport.
3,do the jackus,"for more than a decade ive always tried to imagine how i can cook a very delicious food or anything that could be eaten in our mouth.But since i have no money to buy for all ing or anything that could be needed for the cooking , i preferred alwaya to tyhink it for once a whuile.And i hope that somedqay there someone who could be sponsoring my habbit in cooking. So as of now Im very geatful to say htat maybe you can sponsor me for my cooking. So again thank you."
3,Not the best !,"Hi,This book is well written but some parts are really confusing and I think gives wrong info . There are lots of typos as well as wrong IP addressing in the topologies.My suggestion - look for a different book!Saurabh"
3,The animation is ok and the stories are ok,"We got this set and we were hoping for it to be a little better, we felt like the sodom & Gomorrah and tower of babel stories were too dark for our sons to watch but the other stories are good. We have other Bible stories that we like much better than these."
2,Horrible AI and slow gameplay make this a huge bust,"This game rates as the worst I've played. The controls respond pathetically slow, so forget blocking, and the dodges that you do are so pathetic looking it is funny. The AI does nothing but block, block, block, and once an eon throws a punch. However, the game is pretty exciting in 2 player mode. Get yourself Ready 2 Rumble, or if you are a hardcore boxing fan hungry for something with real guys, take a gamble on KK 2000, I heard they corrected their screw ups."
3,Split Decision,"It's kind of choppy, and the characters aren't very real looking, but I can deal with it. (I didn't pay full price for it.)"
4,"This game is realesitc, with real boxers in it.","This is a great boxim game. If thats what you are looking for, then get this game. I have alot of fun with this. You can choose from real boxers to contend, or you can make your own boxer and fight him against the greats. Go for it!"
4,Rather Pleased,"If any of you out there aren't satisfied, or are with somebody who isn't satisfied with the size of your clock, this is definitely the product for you. After purchasing this, you'll definitely have the biggest clock on the block!The only problem I've had with it so far is that people keep wanting to touch it. I can't tell you how many times I've had to tell people to get their hands off my clock."
2,Issues,Ordered it then recieved it 6 weeks later becasue it was on backorder even through Amazon listed it in stock. Was offered a 5% discount for waiting then got charged the full amount until I asked about the discount. after recieving the hand did not fit on the time piece correctly. had to buy a new one for $8 and reinstall it. Runs well now and looks great
3,Doesn't work,"hello all,I was SUPER-excited to receive this but just like all other reviews, it doesn't work. I don't care, I'm still keeping it, I may even buy working parts.. I've seen this clock on other websites for more then double the price and now I see why. My problem with the clock is that the hour hand doesn't turn, it simply falls and points to six. Everything else is functional and nice(minute hand/overall appearance.) I tried calling or following up with amazon on this but the only instructions I recieved were to return the product.. I did not want to do this so I'm keeping it and going to buy another system and hands to make it look nice AND WORK.. So yeah.. Looks awesome, even if it doesn't work... Beware. :)=Aldo"
4,All feedback is right,"This is really nice and a great value for money. It was packaged well and was easy to put togehter and hang. This is not Ikea/PB in that you have to have tools, etc. There's no real instructions/guidance.The hands are really flimsy. I did manage to bend them but was able to put it together and get it to work.From up-close, it's rough, from 10 ft, it looks great."
2,Not satisfied,"Very disappointed with this clock. I was hoping the negative reviews were just picky excuses, however, the material appears very cheap, screws were missing and the shipping box was open on one end. Not worth the money."
4,PERFECT :),"I LOVE THIS CLOCK!After reading reviews, I knew not to expect much in regards to the clock hands/arms.I simply purchased a new set which was more suited to the clock and it's perfect!"
1,Piece of crap!,"Ordered this as a gift for a friend. She recieved it in time but the clock was missing the hands and the screws to put it together. When I asked them to send the missing parts the item had gone out of stock by then. What an embarrassment for me! I do not know if the item would have worked eventually or not, but not having all parts didn't really help determine that either!"
1,Clock movement comes broken,"When I originally received my clock, it came in a beat up, flimsy box. It looked great once hung and hanging was easy. However, the clock movement mechanism had a broken shaft so the hands could not be attached. Also, the hands come very poorly packaged so the cheap aluminum needs to be restraightened prior to hanging.I requested a new clock from Amazon which came within 24 hours. Same terrible packaging, another broken movement mechanism.However, I like the look enough that I have purchased a movement mechanism separately and will fix this myself."
4,Just What I was Looking For,"I love this clock, I have been looking for an over sized clock and this was exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is regarding the instructions they could have been a little more clear. I received a blurry copy of illustrated directions, so it was a bit unclear but I was able to work it out as best as I could. Overall I love the Roman Numeral Design Wall Clock"
2,Volcanoes Jersey,"Size is inconsistent with description and label. The shirt is definitely not an adult M size, though it is labeled such."
5,Sturdy and soft baby building blocks,"I bought these for my son when he was about 4-6 months old. He just chewed on them for the first few months, but his cousins and friends who are a couple years older love to build with them. I ended up buying the Wee Wedgits 30-piece set so there would be more to go around. I also bought a huge set of regular Wedgits for my husband because he liked the Wee Wedgits, too. These are soft and quiet when they fall, unlike Wedgits which are very hard and make a loud crash. They are durable though, so my teething toddler has not done any damage to them."
5,Great for chewers,We love this. It's a bath toy but we use it outside the tub! My 8 month old loves it. We took the smallest piece out just because it was a little small. I think it would be fine but he plays with these while Im not sitting with him. He is able to pick them up and looks like he is trying to piece them together. They are great for chewing. One of my favorite toys we bought him.
2,"Phone not bad, VT crippled by Verizon","This is the phone that made Verizon start telling you that they were crippling Bluetooth. They've settled a lawsuit, and while the policy continues with newer phones-- bluetooth to headsets and such only, not for file transfer to your Palm or PC (they'd rather charge you send yourself pictures..)--at least they tell you about it now."
3,Motorola V710 phone,"The battery is not good, actually is very short, only last two days. It is not consistent with it's Ad."
1,Do your homework before buying this phone,"I am extremely disappointed in this phone. Only because of Verizon and how they have disabled the many features that this phone has to offer. My boyfriend and I brought this phone roughly 30 days apart only to find that the software on his allowed him to download ringtones, pictures, etc. utilizing a transfash. Well, I went out and purchased a transflash as well but quickly found out that I couldn't transfer the files to the new software that is now installed on my phone. Bottom line is if you have the older software you can enjoy this V710 but if you have the newer software FORGET it. I wish that as a consumer there is something that we can do about this misleading options on this phone. I only wish I could return the phone. I truly don't think that what Verizon has done is legal. If anyone has figured out a way to get around their many disabled features, please let me know."
3,great as long as you don't need bluetooth,"[...]Additionally the v710 takes HORRIFICALLY POOR photos indoors, and outdoors unless there is incredibly BRIGHT light. I have a Canon G6 digital camera so I wasn't expecting spectacular pix, but for a $500 you'd think motorola would have done better."
2,Not performing to specifications & Poor software design,"1) Not performing to specifications: battery life is very bad and charging the phone takes time - this phone doesn't really last more than 1.5 days. Poor Design for battery swapping: swapping battery is not an easy job. The cover needs to be removed and often gets stuck (I don't know why) I had to remove the antenna to remove the cover. I had to pry the battery to get it out. Replacing the battery is also an issue. I need to line it up perfectly. I found out the first time I installed the battery. The cover snapped back OK and the phone worked but it wouldn't charge. So swapping batteries is not a solution for the battery life issue.2) Not performing to specifications: camera takes poor pictures based on specifications and comparing to other cell phones that are less epensive.3) Poor user interface design for the Phone Book due to the display of multiple entries for cell, home, office, Fax, etc. with the same contact name."
1,DO NOT BUY,I purchased the phone because of the Bluetooth technology. This technology has been mostly disabled by Verizon. Do not buy if you plan to use this phone with Bluetooth. VERY DISAPPOINTED. WILL SELL SHARES OF MOTOROLA AND VERIZON AS ONLY RECOURSE. BURNED ONCE NEVER AGAIN!
1,WARNING,"anyone who has bought this phone better be careful very careful of what they do my friend had this phone for roughly 2 months. Yesterday i was talking to him and he had to use his moms phone (TXT Messaging, I have a wonderful Samsung a630) and where the to flips open, he opened it and the entire top came completly off of the keypad base of the phone. Now he has two halves of a phone instead. Although he is luky this happened because his charger wasnt working with the phone.He generally takes really good care of his phone as me who throws My samsung and doesnt care and my samsung is just fine and is 5 months old now.ITs so sad how fragile an expensive phone like this is."
4,Misleading reviews - Clarified,"I am writing this review because, I noticed that lots of people here have given negative and bad reviews on this product. I have been owning the V710 since February this year and so far I havent seen anything wrong with it. I also use a bluetooth headset (Logitech) and its been a perfect gadget.From what others say, I guess there could have been few phones that had problems and was not recalled by Motorola. Otherwise, I have had no problems and before I bought, I did a qucik survey of people owning this and they all gave me great feedback."
3,Motorola V710 cellphone,"My husband purchased 2 of these phones for each of us. We've had for over a year and it constantly gives us problems. The battery life is very short. The battery on his phone lasts only a few hours and he doesn't even use it that much.I have a problem with the Bluetooth for my car. Lately, the phone does not ring at all in the car. So, I miss all my calls. This phone needs alot of improvement.I only gave it 3 stars because Verizon service is reliable. The phone has many functions and it's easy to use but as far as reliable that it is not. Do not buy this phone. Not worth the money!!"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT FULL BLUETOOTH CAPABILITIES,"This phone is great, I love it. BUT Verizon crippled it - they disabled object transfer over bluetooth, so you won't be able to get pictures off your phone, put mp3's onto your phone, or download your contact list withouth buying a Transflash Card and Reader.This is something Verizon did because profit is their middle name - they want you to pay $.25/picture to send them to yourself. They want you to buy THEIR ringtones through Get It Now.Other than this problem, the phone is great. Pictures are a bit grainy and dark, but they are as good as can be expected from a phone. The form factor is a bit bigger than expected, but the screen is absolutely huge!For more info about this phone, there is a user community at:www.howardforums.com - it's under the Verizon heading."
2,"phone 4, features 2","I bought this phone the day it was released, which coincided with my Verizon contract expiration and ""free phone"" period, after allowing myself to be seduced by the pre-release hype. As about everybody knows by now, the device is seriosly crippled by Verizon. As a telephone, it's pretty good, though there are undoubtedly others that perform as well and can be got for a quarter the price. The absence of fully functional Bluetooth, however, overrides the features that made it desirable in the first place. And Verizon's attitude towards its early adopters have me seriously considering another carrier the next time I'm due to re-up."
3,How to buy,Does anyone know if you can buy this phone at the discounted price if you already have Verizon's service and you just want to upgrade your phone? I can't seem to find this option when I try to buy this..Thanks
4,"Pretty good, but has a few small bugs","This phone is pretty reliable and easy to use. It has useful featueres, such as bluetooth and a built in camera. On occasion, it needs to be turned off and on to communicate via bluetooth properly with other devices (e.g. headset, palm, computer). This phone does not support OBEX, which means the phone cannot sync contact lists with your computer or palm device. The data transfer is 1xrtt (?) and not EVDO as in the E815. However, unlike the Motorola E815, it can use the analog network as well in case you are in a rural area or if the network is busy (e.g. around New Year or potentially some type of disaster.The phone also has a convenient speakerphone feature.Two types of batteries are available. In addition to the standard battery, the extended battery which is twice as big requires that a larger battery door be placed on the phone.Overall, I wish that they would have been a bit more careful with the software design, but I would definitely buy the phone again."
2,Verizon Screwed this one up,I bought this for the bluetooth connectivity to my Totota Prius navigation system. I connected well BUT when I wanted to move my phone book from the phone to the Prius system it would not work. I took it to the local Verizon Wirelees Tech Support guy and he said that Verizon had disabled the ability of the phone to transfer the phone book. The Prius system (and most Nav Systems) only let you enter new phone #'s etc. from the phone- not the screen. I returned the phone. This is Verizon's problem-- not Motorola's!
2,PRACTICALLY USELESS BLUETOOTH,"Caveat!! this phone is pretty good, but Verizon has limited the bluetooth capabilities to supporting a headset only, in other words, if you want to get a file (ie: photos, addresses, messages) into or out of the phone, you can't use bluetooth to transfer them to or from your computer. You must either pay to e-mail them, buy the software/usb cable, or the extra memory card and card reader. I would have returned the phone, but I didn't buy the bluetooth fob until after the trial period was over. I've written to Verizon, but always get a corporate doublespeak letter in return, and the problem remains."
3,"Not Great, but OK phone","As a phone, it is OK. The volume (even at it's highest setting) is too low. It's got lots features like voice dial, speaker phone, ... most you probably won't use.As a camera - even though it is advertised as 1.2 Megapixels, the pictures and video are pretty worthless.Bluetooth - 99% worthless. I didn't know much about bluetooth before I bought the phone, so I assumed I could use bluetooth from my PC to wirelessly send pictures, ringtones, MP3s, phonebooks, ... and syncronize my phone up to my PC - NOT TRUE. Bluetooth has a bunch of different profiles, and this phone only supports a very small number of them. Mostly for using the phone as a modem or with a wireless headset.Overall - save your money and buy a less expensive phone. I bought 2 of these, and I like my old startacs better."
5,great PHONE,"Generally I don't do reviews but I thought this phone was getting an unjust bad reputation. My last phone was an Samsung N400 on sprint and it was bad.. battery died in a day and lots of dropped calls. So my my criteria were good battery life, great reception and speakerphone. Basically i wanted a good phone that would always be available to use. It has excelled in all areas. 0 dropped calls, have yet to have 0 bars, battery can go several days without a charge and the speaker phone is the best i've ever seen.ProsSignal strengthGreat sound qualitySuperior speaker phoneGood batteryNice LCDs and over all good looksConskeypad leaves much to be desired, but i'm getting used to itcamera is so-so at bestbluetooth - no intention of using it so i wish i could have saved some cash and got one without it"
3,Not really worth the price,"This is supposed to be the only non-pda bluetooth phone by verizon. I had to get this phone as I was limited to verizon service- other carriers weren't working well in my area.Pros:Saves last 60 calls dialed and receivedGr8 screen, signalbluetoothCons:Bulky- the antenna gets stuck everytime in my trouser pocketBluetooth probably works, i haven't tried yet, but what sucks is verizon's effort to make money everyway and not let bluetooth be used as the user wantsThe outside display gets blackened out and u have to press the button to see the time.Not too many ring tones, games etc."
3,Verizon Ruins Terrific Motorola Phone,"I went through three or four Motorola 270-C's waiting for a new CDMA Verizon Bluetooth-enabled phone to come out. I bought this one. As far as phones go, there's not much to complain about...Motorola makes a great phone. The v710 has the best reception and sound quality I've found in a cell phone.That being said, I'm sure the reason this ""high-end"" phone is now inexpensive is Verizon's miscalculation when they disabled most of the v710's Bluetooth capabilities. Currently, there's a lawsuit pending against Verizon for this very reason. I see Verizon is now giving away a free Bluetooth headset with the v710 to make you focus on what their Bluetooth will do, because it won't OBEX (object transfer) ...or much else. And, if you want a ringtone or music or anything on this phone, you have to Buy It Now from Verizon. Not me. Ever.""Verizon: We're Always Working For Profit."""
2,Don't buy it for Bluetooth,"As others have mentioned, in an attempt to force customers to use their ""Get It Now"" service, Verizon has crippled the Bluetooth so its only function is to let you use a cordless headset. In other words, Verizon is targeting this, their first Bluetooth phone, to teenagers who spend all their time talking on the phone and all their parents' money downloading silly ringtones and graphics. Working adults who want a phone they can use to store information and transfer it between devices should choose another carrier and another phone.You can find a good overview of the phone's pros and cons--as well as a breathtaking sample of Verizon's arrogance and uncaring attitude towards its customers--at http://www.nuclearelephant.com/papers/v710.html."
1,NEW MOTO E815 PHONE TO REPLACE V710 in Q1 2005,"This V710 phone has had terrible reviews because of its many bad features and numerous problems. Verizon will be releasing Motorola's new EVDO E815 phone to replace this phone very soon. I urge people not to buy this V710 phone anymore and wait for the new replacement. The E815 looks very similar but has an improved keypad, better bluetooth capability, better quality camera and a new version of the speech recognition software. The E815 has been previewed at this month's CES electronics expo in Las Vegas with great reviews. Here is something you can read: http://www.mobileburn.com/news.jsp?Id=1038.Verizon is expected to release the E815 by May 2005."
2,"If you think this phone has a lot of features, think again..","I did some research before buying this phone and I found out that to use a lot of the phone's features, you will end up shelling out way too much money to Verizon. They disable the Motorola-built features and replace them with customized features that they charge you for every time they are used.(...)The phone itself is an unbelievable piece of technology, but has been crippled by Verizon."
1,Would not recommend it,"I have owned some great Motorola phones and some pretty crappy ones. This is the worse so far. I thought you could not get any lower than my old Motorola V60, but this one takes the cake. Too many issues to mention, but here are a few:- The display in the front only works half the time.- For a while the phone would just turn itself off while you were speaking.- Phonebook entries dissapear.- Battery life is nothing short of dissapointing.Additionally, you really cant do much with the phone. Verizon disabled the bluetooth for file transfer, and even if you buy the motorola connectivity kit, there are very few things you can transfer.As for the positives, well, they are like finding a dollar bill in a cereal box. While there are some nice features, there is nothing there to change your life.As my contract just came up, I will get a new (non-Motorola) phone with a new service and have a burial seremony for this dud."
1,would be great phone if verizon didn't limit the bluetooth and file transfer,"Verizon has disabled the bluetooth file transfer and the file transfer from transFlash, so you have to subscribe to their extra services over the cell network (which they also charge for your airtime) to transfer files and programs. Even mp3 music files.totally defeats the purpose of buying this phone with ""bluetooth"""
2,MOTOROLA v710 with Verizon,"I had 2 phone for past 8 months here are some Pros and ConsCons: -I dont make that many call so my actual instrument usage is very limited insipte of that both of my phones have been replaced twice, The buttons stops working.The buttons are not very friendly, you have to press really hard.The phone stops to charge intermittently with its original adaptors.If there is even a little drizzle, or hands are little bit wet the displays goes out.Camera is no where 1mb pixel, as claimed.Phone is really heavy.Bluetooth and memory card is locked.Pros:-Reception is very goodPhone speaker is excellentBattery life is okay."
4,I'm happy with it.,"I'm sad that people aren't happy with this phone. I've had excellent reception, battery life is awesome, it comes with cool rings, and its not so small that I lose it in my purse! I think this is a great phone."
1,Bad choice...,"The Motorola v710 is an amazing piece of work... to look at. That's about it. When the screen decides to work, it awes. Great color and graphical display. The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this. The worst part about the phone by far is the charger. I have to jiggle the cord around, wrap it around objects, then pray and sometimes it will work. The sales reps spoke of it as if it were the second coming of Jesus, but they must have been lied to as well."
4,Awsome Phone!!!,"Just got it 2 days ago. It took me a long to finalize this phone. As everyone had mostly negative reviews. Here in amazon on cnet etc. Well, the camera isnt that bad. Its as good as what you should expect from a cell. Then the voice quality is superb, and its so loud and clear. You'll love it. The reception is great everywhere.I guess this is the only bluetooth (only voice) choice from verizon, and it has all other features of speaker phone and so on.I guess its a nice choice.Kaushal"
3,Pictures are crappy,"Generally, this phone is fine. The pics are awful. That might need to be fixed, though. Otherwise, it's fairly easy to use."
1,The Critical Edition of Q,"This book is truly a scholarly tome for academia. It is intended for the true biblical researcher. Lay people, those taking Bible classes in church, etc, will find no practical value or use for this book in those studies. However, this is an execllent resource for the professional Bible researcher, educator, or clergy members with a background in this type and depth of study."

1,"Looks nice, but is total junk.","I bought this watch used and with low expectations, and boy were they justified. I knew it wasn't going to be an amazing bargain Swiss watch clone. I had hoped it would be a quality-on-a-budget watch; nice enough. It was not. Even at half-price, it was an overpriced piece of crap.Although pretty, it lost nearly a minute per day, the day function didn't stay synchronized with the time, you could hear the low-quality winding mechanism grinding away as you moved your wrist (winding the watch), and the ""sweep second hand"" was more like ""spastic second hand.""Please, don't buy into the marketing hype. No quality watch maker advertises in SkyMall and also sells spring-loaded shoe insoles through their website. Anyone who knows anything about watches will spot this thing a mile away and think you a fool for being suckered into buying one.Mine's going up for sale on a popular online auction site this evening."
2,"It's not a swiss movement, despite the description","Take a look at the zoom-in view of the back of the watch: it clearly states ""China movement and case"". The product description is wrong and misleading."
2,Chinese watch with Swiss name....,"I purchased this model of Steinhausen I fainted when I found that I often had to manually set the little day of the week dial, as it did not stay synchronized with the timekeeping of the watch, this one in particular is bulky, also the Italian fake leather would fall the pin having an opportunity to loose your watch. This is a Chinese watch with a Swiss name.Does not support the money you pay for it.I would NOT recommend this watch."
4,Steinhousen TW391G Classic Marquise Automatic gold,"The watch is beautiful and works perfectly. Unfortunately, I received 2 wrist bands (burgundy and black) that were never mentioned in the characteristics of the watch. I wanted (and asked for) a brown and blacks bands. However, the post-sales service of Amazon resolved it. I am very happy with the purchase and the service. Would buy back more things without a single doubt."
1,Chinese junk watch,"The design was what attracted me. Very retro and detailed. It looks beautiful. It is just junk. After wearing it for a week I noticed a small hand laying on the bottom of the dial. I took it to my watch repair man. It happened a second time to another small hand. The repair man told me he would repair it as often as I would pay for it, but that I should just save my money. It wasn't worth more than a few bucks, even when running, because of its junk movement. Stienhuasen is a deliberately misleading name. It has no ""Made In "" mark because you are ment to assume it is German or Swiss. It is Chinese and imported by an unscrupulous importer."
1,"Run, Don't Click Away From This Product","I bought this watch from another company along with a TW691G for my girlfriend as treats following a traumatic period in our lives. We were excited to receive them along with their great-looking TM478 winders. They are beautiful watches.Our disappointment followed soon after. After using the NIST to carefully set each watch, (I'm a stickler for this,) and keeping them in their winders, we found they both lost an average of a minute or more a day. They had to be reset daily. Over time, they became a joke and we stopped wearing them except for ""special occasions."" When we brought them out, we found the month dial was one or two settings off, the hour and minute hands were far off. In short, pretty junk.Do not buy this watch."
1,MADE IN CHINA!!,"I had been admiring this watch for some time and finally bought one through the ""steinhausen"" website. It was odd that the watch was delivered from gadgetuniverse.com. I was very supprised to find out that my ""Swiss"" watch proudly had ""Made in China"" stamped on it. (Maybe on the website they meant it was made by a Swissman and not in Switzerland)Anyway, I had the watch for a week before one of the arms fell off. About the same quality you would expect from anything made in China. I returned the watch about a month ago and I am still waiting for my refund. IF YOU BUY THIS WATCH, DO NOT EXPECT A NICE SWISS WATCH!!!"
1,fraud- cheap chinese replication,I bought this watch thinking that it was a swiss movement watch- this is clearly not-- does not hold time-- is NOT well made-- wish i never would have bought watch and I FEEL CHEATED by the company that sold it
3,Made in China?!?!,"I bought this watch as a gift thinking that I was purchasing a ""proudly made"" watch from Europe. Ha! I get the watch and it's ""Made in China""! False advertising!"
2,good message wrapped in a weak presentation,"I was looking forward to seeing a movie with a good plot that showed a little of Columbia & didn't have any objectionable content. The movie was nice but rather ""preachy,"" and although the plot was somewhat interesting, the main characters were not very realistic -- their backgrounds were told more than shown & some parts seemed a little over-dramatized. While older children might be drawn in by the story & the acting, most adults probably will not."
5,Very fast delivery!!,Looked better than the photo when I recieved it.Easy to install in car and very great price.
2,Title,"Not worth it. It does not flow very well. You will not get much out of this. Not at all what I was expecting. I was expecting an actual workout that would assist with escrima techniques that you could work on, on your own. This was just like a long demo CD. Don't bother."
5,Great video and straight to the point,One of the most easy to learn videos on escrima great drills foot work and instruction and besides and one that studied under the great Bruce Lee is someone to pay attention to . I dont need to say anymore
5,The Title To Own,"If you are only going to get one Native American style drumming CD, make it this one. It is superb. Every track is a winner. It is peaceful, but also powerful. David and Steve Gordon are masters of their craft."
1,Not Authentic,"Same as my review for Sacred Spirit Drums. If you are not seeking the true sound of the music of American Indians, you may enjoy this on its own terms. Otherwise, the only thing American Indian about this album are the instruments. Otherwise, while fans of new-age dross may find something unique here to like, this is a cloying and annoying attempt that ""whitens"" true Native American music. Those are not our drumbeats, at least not the American Indian variety, so be warned.Eagle Warrior"
4,Allows me to get focused on myself rather than the world,David and Steve Gordon are masters at Native American rythems. Anybody that has done any drumming can appreciate the energy that they impart into the music. The selection of songs on the CD provide a vehicle to refocus inward and get in touch with yourself. When I am done listening to the CD I feel a new energy and focus.
5,Huge coffee table hardcover book with gray/silver C5 on cover.,"Beautiful layout, nice pictures,good read, big coffee table size hardcover book with gray/silver C5 on cover. covers up to 1997(no convertibles since they were introduced in '98)"
3,You May Not See Your Rebate,"So far, the only way I have been able to obtain my rebate is to pester the rebate company for months until they finally decide I am not going to give up until I get my rebate. Not worht it. The company uses a web site called ""wheresmyrebate"" com. Do not trust them. Other than that, the card is excelent and I recomend the card, just not the company policies."
1,Junk Card! Don't go for it,"I bought this 4 weeks back. When I try to shoot quick events (like fire works, baby smile etc,) by the time I get the picture the actual event what ever I intend to shoot goes off! It has very bad write speed. It's good for taking slow pictures of still objects only."
5,Does its job well,"Easily installed in my PDA, this little chip lets me store hours' worth of MP3s for portable listening.I can also use it in my digicam to store hundreds of photos at a time. Voila! No more lugging a PC or PDA every time I plan to take pictures."
2,Card became unrecognizeable to my Nikon Coolpix,"This card seemed like a good deal for the money. It served well enough for about a month in my Nikon Coolpix digicam, but it was always a bit touchy. The camera would do things like say ""no card inserted"" when coming back from a power-save ""sleep"" mode. I would have to turn in it off and on to get it to work again. It didn't lose any data, but would space out. After a month though, it became unrecognizeable to my camera. ""Card not formatted"" or something. It still works w/ my flash readers, but not with my camera. Dissatisfying to say the least."
5,It's a memory card - what more do you want?,"It was suggested for the camera I purchased (Kodak EasyShare DX4900), and they had a discount. It works fine, and it has a picture of a viking on it. It holds about 110 pictures."
4,As expected,"I can't say much for or against this card. It is not flashy or ""USB Enabled"" (does anybody ever use that feature anyway?) but it does exactly what I expected it to, at a reasonable price."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought the Viking 128 MB compact flash because I'm tired of waitng 6-7 seconds for my 2.1 MP digital camera to save an image. The card is advertized as having a write speed of 1.2 MB per second. When I installed it in the camera, though, it took 6-7 seconds to store a 700-800 KB image, no improvement and certainly not 1.2 MB per second which should have stored the image in less than one second."
2,Viking CF128M Incompatible with Nikon 775,"I purchased this item to use with my Nikon 775. I checked with the Viking Configurator which indicated there was no problem. When I attempted to use the card, however, my camera warned the card could not be used. The card works fine in my older HP C30. I gave the item 2 stars instead of 1 because the card worked in my older camera. I sent an e-mail to Viking but got no response. By the way, Amazon's policy on returns is a restocking fee if the package is opened. How are you going to find out something does not work unless you open the package and try it? Buyer beware!!!!"
1,suddenly stopped working,"Bought this card for my Minolta S404. Worked fine from Nov to January, although I only took about 150 pictures.Tried to take some today and my camera said 'NO CARD'. There were about 30 pictures on it from our vacation in FLorida in December, they are now lost.Put it in my SmartDisk Media reader and it could not be read.Switched cards to a 16 MB Lexar and it reads fine in my camera and media reader.Will be returning this card. Thank goodness it has a long warranty."
4,Good service,+ Seller contacted me right after the payment.+ Acknowledged reception of payment.+ Let me know that the product was shipped.+ It is possible to track/locate the product.- it took about 10 days before I received the good.Overall Very Good Service but slow.Thanks!
1,too much of a good thing,I was very excited to expand my memory for my new kodak mc3 only to find out it won't accept a memory card greater than 96mb. Buyer beware.
5,A trouble free compactflash,"Bought this Viking 128MB compactflash card (never heard of Viking before)and it just keeps on storing all my pics and displaying them when I need them without any problems whatsoever.Just remember, as in all CF units, it's best to format the card to your camera before using."
4,Viking 128 MB Compact Flash Review,"The Viking 128 MB card represents an excellent value today as Compact Flash prices finally begin to come down a bit. I use the $1/per MB rule as a basis for what represents a good value at today's prices (June 2001). ..., the Viking card comes in well below that figure and I know of no card by Viking or any other manufacturer with a lower dollar per MB price.Having said that, the only complaint is the Viking card does seem a bit slower to write to, than say a Lexar card, but unless you are in a big hurry or need to take rapid sequences of shots, this is not a big complaint. I suspect, it's as fast as most cards today aside from Lexar.Now, if I was only allowed to buy more than one... Oh, well, I guess [they] want to keep people from harding them at this price."
3,SLOW NOW,I was really happy with the Viking CF cards till I got a Lexar. It is noticabilly faster. With the Cannon that matters cause the shutter is already kinda slow. I recomend you check out the Lexar.
1,Price value NOT enough,"A few months ago I purchased 2 Viking CF128M memory cards for my new Canon S45, so I could have a spare card at all times. The price was very good and they seemed to be working fine.Today, one of the cards died (CF ERROR) after about 80 pictures, causing me to loose shots I had taken for my photography class (among others). I thought my camera was not working but I verified it was the card. I was very surprised and frustrated to find out that this situation is NOT that uncommon. How can we embrace digital photography if at any moment the storage device will fail and we can loose ALL pictures residing in the memory card?I am now afraid to take serious shots with my digital camera!I would like to know if this is a problem with all CF cards in the market?I'll have to see how responsive Viking will be to my complaint."
3,Better instructions please,"Raindrip Low-Flow Sprinkler Kit #R547DP DID NOT include instructions inside the package. Instructions printed on the box were covered by the shipping label. When the label was removed, the instructions were not readable. A search of the shippers website presented the instructions in PDF format. However, this was a picture of the instructions on the box and it was blurry (again not readable)."
3,fine for the price,Not impressed with the quility of the spikes broke three trying to attach the hose to it. Works fine used as extra heads to an existing system
5,The best book in the series yet!,"By book's end you ""can't tell the players without a scorecard."" That's because two groups of bad guys are involved, with our heroes in the middle.As for the characther development:1. The C.D./Jimmy scenes were great;2. The Walker/Alex scenes were good; hopefully they will continue to improve in QUANTITY as well as QUALITY--maybe the plot for Book #4 can be Alex-oriented?Two further notes:1. Mr. Reasoner STILL needs to start saying ""CD's Bar & Grill"";2. The shameless use of ""Lone Wolf Cigars"" was hilarious!!"
1,Did not like it,"First of all, I find it a little bit strange that the previous 3 reviews, all giving this book five stars, are written by a customer. No user name at all. Hmm...?Anyways, I didn't really like this book. When I received it I was amazed, this book is HUGE! Too big to bring anywhere, luckily it's easy to read and I read through it in two days. Keep in mind that bringing this book anywhere will be impossible, unless you carry a back pack everywhere.I like the mix between stories and photographs, but to me this is not a well written book. The grammar isn't always at its best and I don't feel like I'm getting close to the Louise and Patricia, I just don't feel for them as much as I wish I would have. I have read a lot of books on this subject and this is not one I would recommend. I wasn't moved, nor shocked and to be honest, it bored me a little.Skip this one!"
5,Perfect for American Girl type clothes,"These are just perfect for my daughter's American Girl clothes that I didn't buy directly from American Girl. She has an armoire for them, but didn't have any hangers and these work just great. I do think they're a bit pricey, though. Instead of 4 for $8, maybe 6 or 8 for $8 would be more reasonable. Overall, very pleased with the product, though."
2,perfect for doll closet...but pricey!,Our granddaughter loves the coat hangers and keeps the doll clothes well organized in the doll closet...but they are much too expensive.
4,Doll clothes hangars,Just what I needed. My husband built an armoire/closet for our granddaughter and the hangers are jthe perfect size. Can hang matching shorts/pants as well.
4,Generation doll,"The hanger are for an 18"" doll. They worked great to hang the clothing on. Easy for little hands to use"
1,Hangers for doll clothes,They are just plastic hangers but they do Not hang on a regular bar in your closet. They will only fit a doll house closet bar.
3,Had to return it... Left handed players cant play!!,"I got this game for my daughter because she LOVES spiderman!!!! I mean, its seriously an obsession!!! She and my husband both sat down to play it one night... it was IMPOSSIBLE for my husband to play because he's left handed!! The game does not allow you to change things around. You need the stylus and the buttons to play and this made it absolutely impossible for him!! My daughter was upset because it was very difficult for her. Being the huge spiderman fan she was, she politely asked if she could get another game. This said a lot!!! She's the type of kid who would suffer thru a bad game just to watch spiderman! HAHAHA So after 3 days of owning it... back to the store it went!! Fortunately my video game store has a 1 week game grace period. if you dont like it... bring it back!!"
3,Good Quality,"This game we bought used came well packaged and was in great working order , i would definitely purchase an item from these guys again ."
4,Melville's point,"Billy Budd is a novella, short but admittededly not an ""easy"" read. You must apply yourself - it is not like a Grisham novel, or even a Tom Clancy. The action moves excruciatingly slowly, because the action is not the point. The book is a character study, a study in the contrast between innocence and evil, the good and evil sides of the nature of man. So, yes, Melville describes the characters of the story in minute detail before the action is allowed to begin...because that is the point - watching them interact, watching the interplay between the serpent and the dove.The BOOK is great. That's not the problem - it is a lack of critical reading ability in our general populace that is the problem."
3,Telling story of humanity,"If you're able to look past the words into the story like Melville's other works, this is worth the read. Some sections seem long, but remember that Melville is giving you the background you need to have your own insights into what type of person the character is. The lessons learned from this book are directly applicable to life in any society."
5,Loved the service,Ordered for the Holidays and it said the shipment might not be delivered on time. Just a couple of days passed and I received it by mail. Awesome service! It was joyful to see the happy faces when the gift was opened. Thank you

4,Shop Cabinets & Tool Stands,"Liked the look of the tablesaw stand on the front. Several noteworthy plans for woodworkers inside that would make nice additions to home or workshop. For the person looking for a nice design to start with and options of planning to follow, this would add to your idea pool."
2,Stine's Horror for Kids,This is 3 short films adapted from horror icon R.L. Stine's books. Don't let the Not rated fool you. It's not scary and it's just a waste of time. If you want real horror try The Evil Dead or Lucio Fulci's sicker than thou horror films. When I was growing up R.L. Stine was probably the most popular author my classmates were into. I wouldn't recommend it for casual horror fans.
3,A very good (but somewhat scattered) book-length FAQ,"My one quibble with Dr. Vernon's book is that the smorgasboard of questions to which he provides answers seems a bit arbitrary and haphazard. For example, how about answering the question about what the current leading theories of tinnitus causation are, or what (in Dr. Vernon's vast experience) is the best treatment strategy for someone who suffers from this condition? You must look elsewhere for that kind of information.In fact, the lack of systematic exposition gives you the sense of a game of trivial pursuit as Dr. Vernon jumps from topic to topic. But it must be said that, for all that, one can learn a great deal from this pioneer in tinnitus treatment and research, and the tone of the book is positive and filled with warmth and an obvious and deep commitment to helping those with ""ringing in the ears""."
4,So far so good.,"I just got my ring in the mail and I love it. Its very pretty and simple which I wanted. I must say its a little tiny, the width but I still love it."
5,nice ring and good customer service,I really liked the ring and bought another one from them and will buy another one soon.
3,Celtic Knot Pinkie Ring,I plan to return the ring as it doesn't match the other Celtic piece I have.
2,Cute Enough to Wear On Occasion...Turns Finger Green,"It's not nearly the quality I was expecting. First day after washing my hands a few times, it started to turn my finger green. I have to constantly switch where I wear it to avoid this. It's very thin, a flimsy feeling but still cute enough to wear as an accessory when going out."
5,Great ring!,"I've had this ring for over a year now and it's held up very well! I wear a size 6 on my middle finger (I have really slender fingers) and it's been there for quite some time now. It's light and slender and now I don't even notice it on my finger anymore. My ring hasn't contorted out of shape really, its still pretty circular and I'm sort of like a tomboy (I train in Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai and keep the ring on my finger while I train). I've gotten a ton of compliments on it!"
3,Beautiful but thin,"The ring is a little bit on the thin side, I went to clean it and squeezes a little to hard when I was holding it and it started to bend. The holes in the knot are a little too small so if something gets in it like lotions or dirt its hard to get it out."
2,SMALL,"This ring was extremely small. My Husband bought this for me as a ""get out of trouble gift"" and ordered a 10, well, we took it to our jewlers and it was an 8!!!! NOT COOL!"
4,Pretty nice gift.,"It felt a little cheap and flimsy to me, but my bestfriend, whom I bought it for, liked it very much!"
4,Great style!,I got this in the mail 2 days ago..It only took 3 days to get it..it's a little thin. It fits on my pointing finger..I love the design.. I got a size 9... It fits perfect!
1,Very Thin ring,This ring is very thin in volume this makes it very uncomfortable when wearing it cuts into the skin. For the price it is ok.
3,Cheap little ring,Cheap little ring for the money I bought 2 to use as pinky rings they are very cheaply made and bend and not true to size. I like the design just wish it was sturdier and made so much better.
5,good,My son plays tuba and it is just the right thing to inspire a young player to have a collections of works featuring some of the instruments he plays along with in class.
5,Awesome book,"I love this book, and I wish her parents would let her do more things. Joey sounds like a really nice guy and he would never hurt her. She has good friends to ask questions and if there is anything that is bothering her she can always talk to her Aunt."
4,GOOD,"This book rocked, but really, if you liked it, you will LOVE all her other books!!! Check out the other ones, too!!! The other ones are my favorites, but this one is really good, too!!!"
2,Too Much Jabberin,"The CD has too much of their own egotistical laughter and not enough of the great dialogue with callers about cars. In fact, this CD is not car talk, but talk about loosely related topics such as love affairs. Very disappointing."
2,"Bloodthirsty amateur film,but...","I was not prepare to see such an amateur film like this.It seems like Demons meets Dead alive,but its not that good.Altough it has good roots,Todd Sheets have talent,entusiasm,we see in the future.It has pretty gory scenes,but there is thousands of untold answers.As I say,we will see in the future,Todd..."
4,Homage to Argento has a bit of spark,"OK, so this one has plot parts from Demons, and it takes place in a theater, but that is where the similarities in this delerious movie stop. It is really pretty good in a b-movie way. I like the creepy place it is filmed and I like the effects, though they are pretty low budget. A head tearing is actually pretty funny and gross at the same time. There is some great suspence in it, and the story is actually kind of involved once it gets rolling. Original? NO. Enteraining? YES.Another fine, fun movie from our favorite shock master."
3,When the book claims that while bad Saddam was taken down it makes an error saying that there were no wmd discovered in Iraq,"Books like On The Hunt by Col. David Hunt and webpages at google ""Saddam's WMD: Discovery and Denial"" plus webpages on the wmd discussed by Sen Rick Santorum show there were some wmd found in 21st Iraq after all!"
1,"Too ""politically correct""","For a history book, this one is disturbing; for example, on p. 217 is the ""Declaration of Sentiments,"" which I had never heard of. It follows ""The Declaration of Independence,"" ""The Constitution,"" and ""The Gettysburg Address."" So I thought it must be important; however, unlike the aforementioned documents, there is no information identifying the origin of this document. The index does not reference this ""important"" document either. On the Internet, I learned this document is from the beginning of the Women's Movement; but instead of the listed date of 1948, the date actually was 1848. Lack of fact-checking is very serious, especiallly in a history book. The book is not so much history as propaganda for the ""politically correct."" I ordered this book for my granddaughters, but I certainly would not give it to them!"
2,a quick read,"The best thing about this ""book"" is its cover. Actually, it's not a book but a pamphlet. At $9.95 and just 64 pages, that's 15.5 cents per page! For that price, she should have thrown in some pictures of herself during her dancing days. She should have also hired a proofreader to fix some spelling errors and paragraph breaks in the middle of sentences.It does give some good tips, but most are quite obvious. I could have shortened the book down to 3 lines:Cater to the stripper's vanity.Don't stink.Don't have a beer belly.Sorry guys, but if you look like 95% of the guys who go to strip clubs, you apparently don't stand a chance at dating one of the girls.If Selena writes a real book on the behind-the-scenes stripper world, I might read it. (I found the most interesting part was the glossary of strip club lingo.) But for those actually looking to date a stripper, save your money."
1,Be Careful,Careful when you read reviews. Note that all 5 star reviews fell within a week of each other. Wonder who wrote them...
2,Another waste of money,"And two stars is a gift. I've know lots of exotic dancers and I learned on my own how to get to know them and what they oftne like in a guy, though this varies a great deal. As someone said most of this is pretty obvious without having to think too much.I've read other books over the years and some of them are a lot better than this book, but none of them really live up to their billing. If you want to be able to date a dancer, you better know how to interest a fmeale in general and create the attraction. Afterall they meet dozens of guys each week and you can bet everyone of them wants to be with her, and she can have her pick. Nowhere in this book do you learn what it is to turn here head."
1,What a metaphor for a strip club!,"You look at the cover, get all exicted, spend a lot of money, then feel like you have been ripped off."
1,Book for dopes,The book should be titled how to get losers to date a girl with no self esteem and a head full of rocks.
2,Not as good as many others.,"Not a very ""enticingly"" written book. All of the photos and illustrations are in B/W. Few of the Photos show the hand or the knife, they are merely of Carvings sitting on a table surface. Definitely not going to inspire you to take up the hobby. I found Carving Caricature Heads & Faces by W. ""Pete"" LeClair and Tom Wolfe Carves Wood Spirits to be far superior in info transfer, and giving you a feel for the craft.Color photos aren't what make a book however, check out How to Carve a Woodspirit in a Hiking Stick by Skylar Johnson for a short concise and spot on B/W book."
2,Good book if you can already carve,"Book is good and has patterns etc. Problem is, if you arent already a proficient carver, this book will not really walk you through each step of the way. If you already can carve well, this is perfect for some cool patterns and photos to model your carving on."
2,Just Okay,"The title is misleading, the songs are hardly what most would consider traditional. While I did enjoy a few of the selections most were almost unrecognizable. Maybe a better title would have been Innovations on Traditional Catholic Hymns."
4,A trip down memory aisle,"Fr. Stan does a wonderful job of keeping traditional Catholic hymns alive. I don't hear many of these songs as much as I used to at Mass. This is unfortunate since this has been a hidden foundation of good orthodox theology during a time of confusion. Teachers can introduce odd teachings but when we hear these songs, we hear the clear truth.The recording quality is high and Fr. Stan has a wonderful voice. I almost feel as if I am back at my old parish back when churches looked like churches and had the acoustics to make a good singer sound like an angel.Yet there is more to this recording. There is a modern tone through out the recordings. The mix of traditional and modern are done just as they should be with hymns, reverently. This is a great CD!! I hope Fr. Stan will come out with ""More Traditional Catholic Hymns""."
1,"Better title:""UNtraditional hymns""",The title for this album is very misleading. A majority of the songs aren't even traditional catholic hymns. The musical arrangements make the music sound New-Agey and cutesy.
1,"""Traditional Catholic Hymns""?","Why is this ""Traditional"" CD full of songs produced in the last 40 years? (a mere second in the life of the Church, young grasshopper ;-) ) Frankly, liturgical music has been has been in a pretty sorry state for the last few decades. ""On Eagle's Wings"" isn't as theologically dubious as some of the other songs I've suffered through at Mass, but the words aren't exactly INSPIRED, and the melody sounds like a rather unsubtle score for a melodramatic moment in a movie. And why make the situation worse by rendering songs in jazz and rap styles, among others? It MATTERS what style music is played in, and twisting music like this just for the sake of novelty is not nessesarily good for worship. What's next, ""Death Metal Mass, to be sung by KISS""?Anyway, I'm kinda sad they didn't put ""Faith of Our Fathers"" or ""Holy God We Praise Thy Name"" on here... Not to mention the Tantum Ergo, Pange Lingua, Vexilla Regis, etc. Sigh..."
4,Windchimes & Water,"While this CD was not exactly the sound I was looking for as it falls a bit flat by sounding mostly the same the whole way through, it has little treats in it, like the trickling water parts, and best of all the windchimes that tantalize the senses for a bit. After awhile the same old flutes bore me though... Overall happy, but if you like any uplift in your massage music, I recommend choosing a different CD."
3,It's better than nothing,"It's a good listing of places to hike and it includes information about distance and elevation gain, but it doesn't tell the best time of year to go on the hike or give proficiency ratings."
1,chiefs,"my mom and sister just bought chiefs 4dvd set..it has poor movie quality ,and make sure that is states if it is english, german or any other nationality which was a problem for them..will not recommend this dvd set to anyone.."
4,Great discussion starters!,"I conduct workshops and train trainers, and this book is full of great questions to facilitate participant dialogue.My team and I are constantly on the lookout for fun and interesting ice breakers and energizers. This book is a good resource. After each question, a ""war story"" and a ""user's manual"" section appears, with useful how-to information.I recommend ""75 Cage-Rattling Questions."""
3,You can come up with these,"I wouldn't disagree with any of the other reviews, but it's a matter of personal preference where I spend my money. I wouldn't spend it on this book. Once you focus on what you want to accomplish (ie., ""shake-em-up""), you could come up with a lot of these challenges. ""If your company were a car...If your company were a footbal team.."" and so on. In a word, analogy. I've found in workshops I've conducted, whether they're on Creativity, Problem-Solving, Leadership, or other topics, I'll use this ""provocative"" technique maybe once or twice in a full day. Beyond that the novelty has worn off.Much of the text that accompanies each question is also a little repetitious - the ""war stories"" all start to sound alike."
4,Actually useful,"I was surprised at how useful this book is. When I first looked at it, I thought the questions looked obvious and simplistic, but they work very well to start off team meeting sessions. The authors provide lots of good ideas about how to use them, and little anecdotes to inspire you to believe that the questions can actually change the way you do business. I've used them for meeting kick-offs and to jump-start moribund discussions."
4,"Aspirin Helps Prevent 850,000 Deaths In USA Each Year",This book helps the reader discover the reasons that Aspirin has been called the pharmaceutical bargain of the century. The author clearly explains to you why and how aspirin works to prevent deaths. Millions of Americans who might benefit from Aspirin are not taking it. This is a tragedy since Aspirin costs less than one penny per day.
2,"Love the bottles, not the trainer...","My breastfed son LOVED the Dr. Brown's bottles and used them exclusively when I was at work. When it came time to try a trainer, we were excited to try the Dr. Brown's trainer. Unfortunately, it was not what we'd hoped. 1) It's HUGE, so a large amount of liquid must be placed inside. Otherwise baby/toddler will have to tilt his head at an extreme angle to get any liquid. 2) It's leaky. We've had lots of leak issues with this trainer. 3) If the valve isn't positioned just perfectly, the child sucks and gets nothing but air while the trainer leaks all over the place. 4) It's expensive! I really wanted to love this trainer, but in the end it didn't work out for us. We finally ended up using a Nuby silicone trainer at first so that my son got the idea of sucking on a soft trainer, then switched to Playtex sippy cups which are excellent! Sorry, Dr. Brown's..."
1,So disappointing,"I bought these cups because we had used the bottles and loved them and my son was having difficulty drinking from other sippy cups. They are easier to drink from- because there isn't anything preventing fluid from flowing right out. Even with the valve correctly placed (which is a trick), it dribbles. Not to mention that they leak from under the lid. I have made them the official ""water sippys"" because they make such a mess but I'm too cheap to throw them away. I may just give in and chuck them."
3,NOT SPILL PROOF,"This is definately a training cup. We only used them at the table. You do not want you child carrying this cup around the house or out and about. I took it on a trip to the store the first day i had them..........OOPS, it leaked everywhere. Great training cup, just not a spill proof cup!"
1,Horrible cup!!,"These cups are horrible!! At first I loved them because the liquid does flow easily from them - when it comes out. My daughter (11 mos) was getting so frustrated with the cup one day, so I gave it a try, nothing but air was coming out. I keep trying to use them (we have four and none of them work), but about 90% of the time, nothing comes out but air. then I resort to taking the stopper out and that makes a huge mess. DO NOT BUY THESE CUPS!! I don't know why I keep trying to use them, they are so frustrating!"
3,Its alright,We only used dr browns Bottle when my girls were little. So when i saw that they now made sippy cups i got excited. They work but the problem is that they are heavy for little ones to start using. My daughter is 9 months old and she doesnt like it bc she cant hold it up high enough to get a drink. And shes not a flighty dainty child she pretty big for her age. SO maybe when shes a little older this will come to good use
2,Missleading picture,"The item pictured is not the real item, nor the item shipped. Product received was the PVC 5' tall trailer guides.........NOT THE ROLLER AS PICTURED. I even called Overton, before purchase, and they were very nice and congenial, but even they couldn't be exactly sure of the identity of the item. Ultimately they stated that they figured that it was like the one pictured...NOT. Price was right, delivered proptly...so I just took it and made it work, even though it was not the item I thought I ordered, and talked to Marty at ""Overton"" about. He was very nice, but not it. Thanks anyway, Allan"
3,Thicker Than Expected,This paper was much thicker than I expected it -- more like cardstock. I used it for a family newsletter. Colors were nice and vibrant.
3,"Wow,","Wow. It's been long since anybody reviewed this song. I heard this song, and I just wanted to give it a review. Inoj's voice is sweet (how do you pronounce her name, by the ways). The beats are nice. But, Cyndi Lauper sang it way better. Inoj's version lacks the powerful vocals that Cyndi had. If you're not sure what I mean, listen to the second time the chorus comes. The ""I will be waiting"" was just too breathy. Overall, it's a pretty decent song, but I'd much rather listen to Cyndi's."
5,Great remix - - - gets you dancing to the music,"Inoj's ""Time After Time"" is a great remix. I listen to it over and over in the morning to get me going before school. After you listen to this song a few times you'll be hooked too!"
1,This is an awful imitation of the real thing.,"This song has too much bass and is too fast; it also doesn't have the necessary male voice and is meaningless without it. Don't even listen to it, if it comes on the radio, turn it off."
1,Travesty,"This song is an affront to the original. She can't even get the lyrics right in half of it. It is not supposed to be an upbeat song. It's a sad song, which is supposed to have the soul and melancholy notes that Cyndi gave it. Truly horrid."
5,Super EuroBeat!!!,"Wow just wow this is one of the best albums ever. Now if u may think super eurobeat is dumb, i did to when i first herd about it but its really a great type of music anyways this is a great album has many good songs (Well See Heaven, Lets Go Come On, Revolution, Forever Young and many more) plus some famous super eurobeat group. A must buy for super euro beat lovers."
1,Bad-Bad,I received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so I called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc. I have since returned both pads in the same box.
4,Good starter course.,"It seems most of the other reviewers here are commenting on the condition their used copy arrived in rather than the quality of the instruction received from the book which is rather more helpful to someone thinking of picking up a copy. I felt that Italian without the Fuss was an enjoyable beginner's level course. The dialogues were fun and while much might be missed one the first pass, after you finish the associated chapter you should really be able to ""get"" that conversion - even if you don't understand each word. All in all, I would recommend this BUT there are other courses that are better, albeit much more expensive (think: Pimsluer)."
5,Italian is easy!!,"If you are looking to learn and study Italian independently, then this book is an excellent tool. It is enjoyable and understandable to read. The author includes great tips about the language and culture. When ordering the book, please make sure it includes the CD. The CD is a great way to hear the language over and over again. I highly recommend this book."
1,Italian with out a fuzz,Is not incondition to can use again to much writing and notes in the answer boxes.
5,A Very Good Book,"OK, I am a friend of Doug Williams, and we have been encouraging him to write a book like this for years. I'm not really a baseball fan, but I really liked this book. It is not only about baseball, but also about friendship, values, and family relationships. I told Doug that I took it on a business trip to read at bedtime, but it was so good that I stayed up two extra hours to finish it. The book is very well written and I recommend it highly."
2,A classic but not so great to watch,This movie is really hard to watch because the quality of picture is black and white and not exactly a crystal clear picture. The sound is also not the best quality. I would not recommend this video.
5,LAWRENCE WELD DVD,I purchased this DVD for an Alzheimer center. The clients there loved it and have watched it over and over. It is fun to watch their faces as they relive happier times.
2,Sound quality was poor.,"The show streamed perfectly fine but the sound was barely audible. This was with all volume settings maxed with PC and television. Didn't have problems with any other on demand videos so my best guess was the transcoding didn't go as well as it should have. Since Lawrence Welk is all about the music, it left for an unsatisfactory experience."
4,Mom loves it!,Mom loves to view the episodes of yesteryear and my sisters enjoy watching it with her. Would recommend to the older generation.
5,Great Health Guide,"A great health guide for women with heart disease, or women who want to prevent heart disease. The text is well written andeasy to understand."
2,Bland Music,"There's just no real reason to recommend this, or to listen to it. If you want to hear creative globally-tinged music check out Material's ""Seven Souls"". If you want to hear Herbie play funky check out ""Thrust"". But there's nothing here to enjoy."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I loved ""Dilvish the Damned"" and re-read it from time to time, enjoying it all over again. This book, pretty much a sequel to ""Dilvish the Damned"" I read once. That should say something right there. There were some really cool images and I enjoyed the first half of ""The Changing Land"". However, the end was somewhat disjunct and the tone and writing of the book was very different from that of ""Dilvish the Damned"". Read this book if you love Zelazny's writing. Have you already read at least 18 different books by Zelazny? If so, maybe give this a try. If not, pass this one by for something else."
2,Poorly Designed and Difficult to Install,I purchased this item for my Breezy Ultra 4 Wheelchair. Each grip has two parts. An inner foam piece and the outer fabric cover. The foam goes around the metal wheel grip and has self adhesive edges to make it stay in place around the wheel grip. These take some stretching around the grip ring and especially past the standoffs which attach the grip ring to the wheel. But once you have struggled through this they seem to stay in place OK. The fabric cover is much more of a challenge. It is not wide enough to go around the foam core with out a lot of tugging and trying to compress the foam. I could barely get enough wrap to close the Velcro strips along the edges especially around the standoffs. After a week's use the Velcro edges started to open and had to be re-closed.Also the ends of the cover are not adequately dealt with. The grips are are comfortable to use but a real pain to install and maintain.
2,Cloth cover too small,"It is a great idea, however, the cloth cover over the foam does not fit.....more cloth is needed. Placing the foam on the rim is simple.....but it isn't possible to then compress the foam on the rim enough to bring the Velcro closures together except in a very few places. The grip posts, which attach the grip ring to the wheel, also present a problem....the foam will compress around them but the cover with the Velcro must slide around them so no closure is possible. Do not spend your money on this product."
1,Don't bother,"I was looking for a book that compared & constrasted all the different project management methodologies. According to the book's description & the feedback from the other readers, this was a very good book. I was alittle apprehensive about the book because of its age, but since the book dealt with methodologies & not the latest technology, I thought I should be ok. I was terribly mistaken. The book uses a very general tone & lacks all details. To compound the issue, the author writes about methodologies that aren't used & about methodologies that were never used. This book would have been a terrible book even when it was new. I've never been so mislead by other reviews in my life."
4,Works well,The device works. You have to talk close to the box (no roaming around the room while talking) in order for the microphone to pick up your voice. Though this is common with virtually all low end microphones. I like it.
2,Bad Product,This product went straight to the junk drawer. It hooked up easily but takes over completly on audio. When this is connected it wipes out your other audio output so you have to plug it in and then unplug it each time you need it. Maybe ok for a laptop bag?
1,Don't waste your money on this,The volume is not loud enough and people have a hard time hearing on the other end even when you speak right into it. Spend more money on something that actually works.
1,Kinda works,"This device works, but the sounds quality on it is very poor. The speaker is not great and the mic on it is very weak. I turned the volume all the way up on the mic (which they recommend as the default, which tells you something), and still had problems with the volume being to low. On the plus side, the device plugged in and was picked up right away. I tested it with Skype and except for the volume and sound quality issues, it all seemed to work."
5,The Green Knowe books are wonderful and magical.,"The entire series is pure joy. This, the first in the series, introduces us to Tolly and his grandmother and their mysterious and exciting home. I love the way magical occurences are handled in such a matter-of-fact way that lets one suspend disbelief without even realizing the matter could be disbelieved."
1,Maybe the worse Book I've Ever read,"This is seriously one of the worse books I've ever read. And I love children's fantasy fiction. I am surprised 19 people gave this a 5. REALLY?! It had a lot of potential-the plot and characters both seemed interesting, but the book is BORING. Through 90 percent of the book, we read how Tolly, the little boy, explores the house and grounds (with mundane activity), listens to birds, and plays flutes. The actions are very mundane-look at the book cover; that's pretty much the whole book. Finally, toward the end, we see a climax-one that is supposed to be scary and adventersome, but I personally found it uninteresting and not very climactic. Plus, the book is creepy."
5,---,The disc works. It plays. ...And the movie is excellent!I have to write at least twenty words? Okay:Iron Monkey is a fantastic blend of quality choreography with a plot and setting that are typical to the beloved classic kung-fu genre.
1,Yet Another Textless Kindle Book that you get for free!,"Kindle users, beware!This Kindle book contains no text, just a table of contents and a few headings. A free Kindle e-book seems to mean that you are taking risks and what you see is what you get once you open it in your Kindle. Although not every free book is defective, this is just one of the few textless free public domain e-books I've found on Amazon. The others were a free volume six of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and a free complete edition of Macaulay's History of England."
3,Some what helpful,It was very hard to navigate through. I could not figure out to post cuz I really needed some help.
2,Tortoises,"This book was just beyond me, I guess. It tried to draw an analogy between little tortoises bodies after they were born and the Crucifixion of Christ. It also kept repeating how a young male tortoise kept trying to breed an old, clumsy, ugly female, in GREAT detail, which I thought was disgusting, repetitive, and pointless. Not a good book at all, and certainly not his best work. I don't know what he was thinking on this one."
1,A morbid but hilarious book,"My brother was given this book in the 1950's. I somehow received this book in the 1970's.It is set in New York City. An impoverished and sickly mother and son - coming back after the father's funeral. Harry's main goal became to purchase and carve a grave stone for his mother - who died shortly after. Harry himself got run over by a luxury automobile (obviously a bad and blind rich person :) ) near the end of the book after staying after dark carving that gravestone in the cemetery.We made fun of the book. Everytime my nephews came over, they would ask me to read it. We all cracked up laughing hilariously - every time.On a more serious note, I couldn't help but shake my head that someone would write so depressing a book and call it a Children's book. My Mother thinks this was a great book and can't understand why it isn't a great Children's story. To me it a more of a dark horror story. With thinking like that, no wonder our Christian generation today is so screwed up."
5,Great Impact Bit Set,"This set of bits is outstanding! The bits are very durable and the case is top notch. The bits fit very snugly so when you drop the open case from the top of a ladder you don't have to play find the bits! The set includes long Torx - Mac, Snap-on Trucks have this same set for 2x this price. I was leery of the Irwin brand, having never used there stuff before, but I can recommend this set. I hope the rest of the Irwin line is as durable as these!"
5,Professional grade,"Identical to the sets snapon, matco, etc. sell. This is my second set and they work great."
2,"Pay more, get more","This thing is just okay. The on/off switch is backwards...hmmmm. It will test UTP cables...and that's it. So if that's all you need, and you don't mind off for on, on for off, then it's fine...the price is right. Materials are okay...not too fragile, lightweight. Takes a 9v, which weighs about the same as the actual equipment. The remote piece tucks into the main body so it's pretty compact. Overall I would pay a little more and get a more robust gadget with more to it.Recommended for keeping it simple, not recommended if you're doing more than testing for continuity/connectivity."
3,About worth the cost. Buy a better tester if you really need accuracy.,"The network tested I received came with a dead battery. After a $10 replacement battery (for an odd 6V camera? battery), the tester works as described.However, the tester only tests wire pairs. Not to be overly technical, but this tester cannot detect if there is a short between, say, line 1 and line 2. It also views crossover cables as being miswired (which, I really cannot disagree with that point of view).All and all, for the money, it works well enough. Would not recommend for a professional, but as someone who only occasionally gets asked to wire up ports around the office, it works for me."
3,Very Bizarre!,"DELIRIUM (aka DELIRIO CALO) stars Mickey Hargitay who is a psychologist who is also a demented serial killer. He picks up young girls & kills them in some really brutal fashions. His sexy wife is subjugated to some really perverse sexual fetishes.This is a truly bizarre film that almost defies description. I give it 3 stars only with hesitation because of the disturbing nature of the film, as well as some rreally graphic viloence & some graphic lesbian sex scenes. Anchor Bay has both the US & International versions on one DVD which makes this quite a bargain. Both versions have very different beginnings & endings.DELIRIUM could have been better, but unfortunately, it wasn't. Still, it is a very bizarre & disturbing film that would please many a horror/giallo fan."
1,Yuck,God awful film...both versions of it were total garbage! Damn the movie and damn the leather belt for snapping when I tried to end my misery!!!
3,Could have been much better,"This book is about what you would expect from an autobiography. It didn't get into Where the Boys Are or her Christmas show in Asia with Bob Hope. It did talk extensively about her early pre-celebrity years. Didn't talk much about her later years, except for her rape in the Long Island Motel. I did see Connie perform in Wallingford, CT in 1993 and would recommend her show."
3,Who's Sorry Now?,"Who's Sorry Now? We are. This was purchased as a gift. The picture sleeve shown didn't give us a hint as to how badly the copy we ordered would be. Ours is signed but not authenticated. Well that aside, it will still be a gift. Hope she likes it some anyway. Oh, way over paid for this collectors copy."
3,"Valuable publication, second-rate production","Connie Scarborough's book on 13th century women in the Cantigas is essential reading for anyone studying this field. The information is original and well-argued, and Scarborough has gone on to make a considerable mark in this area of study.However, the production of the book is quite poor. It looks like a dissertation and would have benefitted from professional typesetting. The quality of the pictures makes them virtually unusable. Even the title on the front cover is off-center!So, in short, definitely worth it for Scarborough's scholarship, but Edwin Mellen should be ashamed to be charging $100+ for such a poorly produced book."
5,Hallock's book is healing.I give it 5 Stars with a combat V,"These grunt-level stories are real and understandibly tough. The HELL of war is not hidden from the reader. Hallock writes very well as he peels off the sugar coating to get to the medicine of understanding the political,human,and spiritual cost of war. Hallock helps us realize that nobody wins; we all lose; and some never get to go home physically or spritually. I am 52 years old and a Nam combat veteran who thought he would ""get over it."" The men and women ""I met"" in this collection of 140 stories helped me to reclaim an identity that I buried at the cost of never understanding what really happened to me and my family, who lived with my numbed, distant emotions that only surfaced as anger. It's the first book that I could give my sons and daughter and say this is what it was really like for me. It should be required reading for V.A. counsellors, parents and teachers. I give it Five Stars with a combat ""V""."
5,An eye-opener that will help veterans and their families.,"I worked as Hallock's secretary, typing up his 40 interviews and 100 first-hand accounts of the wars of this century, writing the index, and the countless other tasks that go into the making of a book. What I learned about the hell of war and militarism shocked me, but most of all it taught me compassion and understanding for our country's veterans. As a nation, I believe we need to look deeply at how militarism has penetrated our psyche, devastating lives and families. We cannot afford to continue this pattern. But ""Hell, Healing, and Resistance"" offers hope and a path to healing, for individuals and communities."
2,Better than trying to find the vinyl of Rings of Saturn,"A better introduction to Photek would be the Risk vs. Reward EP. Ni Ten Ichi Ryu and the Hidden Camera are two of Rupert's best songs. This full-length is full of uninspired remixes of some older songs, and original versions of a couple earlier tracks available on vinyl only. Good for the Photek completist."
5,DISAPOINTING!!!,I was expecting a forward evolution of the photek style. this was not it.my problem with this cd is that i hate 98 style drum and bass with its stiff minmalist swing. it sounds like crappy industrial dance music from the early 80s. i would rather listen to dance hall.photek has moved with the pack. so half this cd is variations on that one photek beat that made him famous. the other half is photek experimenting with the new and improved crippled nasty assed dnb beat that i hate. at least photek uses nice textures and nice atmospheres.new photek listeners might want to get modus operendi. i guess this cd would be alright if you like this new shhhhh style.can i recommend amon tobin instead?
1,A TOTAL LET DOWN...,"With high expectations I listened to it, again again again...too minimalist, no layers.The only tracks worth listening to are 9. ""Seven Samurai,"" 10. ""Rings Around Saturn,"" and 11. ""Water Margin."""
2,Lame,This is an attempt at music. For good D&B check out Jonny L or Talvin Sign or Metalheadz. NOT THIS ITS LAME.
3,C.D. is never as good as live at a partie,"Photek rolls out again with the atmospheric yep hard sound that is his own. Tight loops of precision are what I expected, and got. Classic Photek. If you like his earlier stuff, you will like this one. Remixes are good, but I was not blown away by them. A good C.D., Photek comes through again with his own unique technical style of D'n'B. Like my opening says, if you really want to hear good d'n'b/jungle, you need to come visit Toronto's jungle scene!"
3,Middle of the line release from master of musical precision,"I bought this CD soon after I bought Modus Operandi. And I would have to say Form & Function was a disappointment, but after listening to Modus Operandi, anything is a disappointment. I suggest you stay away from this alnum until you listen to M.O. because of the overbearing mechanical precison of this album leaves you feeling dry. Too much uniformity can be a bad thing if it's not backed up with enough variety of sampling. This CD does not have much listening life to it unlike it's exceptional predecessor: Modu Operandi. Form & Funcion was good but could have been a lot better. It just doesn't sound complete, almost as it was released by Photek unfinshed."
3,"A disappointing ,middle of the line release","This Cd sounds like an unfinished product from the music genius, Photek. I purchased this release soon after Modus Operandi and I suggest you get M.O. before this one. F&F contains too much mind-numbing repetiton and lacks the exceptional sampling that it's predessor had. This is a relatively boring CD without variety. If you liked Modus though, you will like this. Tracks 5, 9,10,11,and 12 are very good while the remixes become boring after a couple listenings. Even though i ripped on it i do suggest this for any Photek fan!"
3,too dry,"I'd get Modus Operandi instead if I were you. This CD didn't do anything for me; it only skimmed the surface, never really dive into anywhere"
4,So funny!,This made me laugh so much. My family enjoyed watching episodes they grew up watching. For the price I'd say it's worth it.
5,Great Christmas Music,Greatest Christmas music from the sound of Christmas himself. The voices of the many duets are fantastic. I downloaded mine and it sounds great.
2,Great Christmas classic - poor master,"I just purchased this great Christmas classic but when I play it on my mid-fi equipment, it is very clear that it was copied from a poor master and would need to be remastered (sounds OK - not great on low end equipment). In it's present state - it is a waste of good money when played on mid to high end equipment.Regards"
5,Mark LeBlanc is the absolute EXPERT!,Mark's systems for marketing and growing your business are the BEST! They WORK! And they are simple! This is why I give this book to every professional organizer that I train. It is a must read (and use) for every small business owner.
3,50s style English mystery,"Written in 1958, this is both a mystery and a social commentary on a housewife's life during the 1950's. Louise is a stay at home mother of three little girls, the youngest only six months old. She seems to be going a little bonkers, possibly suffering from some post-partum depression. She and her unsympathetic husband rent a room to an oddball sort of woman. The book's creepiness begins when the odd renter, a teacher, moves in. Suspense builds as does Louise's nuttiness until the final pages when the crashing climax reveals all. This writing is pretty typical of the 40s and 50s style of suspenseful novels, and reminiscent of du Maurier, Rhinehart, and Christie. There's a lot of dialogue, a certain amount of action, a good deal of suspense, and no sex or foul language. Some of which makes it a little dull in places. However it's worth the read, and if you like all your ends tied up the author does a wonderful job."
5,Family Viewing,"Family Entertainment - Fun, Funny, Enjoyed. Age appropriate.New Condition As Promised. Price was right."
3,A Fun Halloweentown Sequel,Halloweentown High is another enjoyable sequel to the Disney's Halloweentown series. This particular movie is even more fun because of Debbie Reynolds' large part as grandmother/teacher. Another enjoyable Halloween-time treat from Disney!
5,"Olesya Rulin as Natalie, the pink troll",Olesya is awesome! She is quite the actress! I think she should have got an even more main part!
4,Halloween fun,"Another great Halloweentown movie. I love these movies and if you loved the other two, then get this one."
4,I love this movie,Doesn't have to be audited by an adult before letting your child watch. It is a cute movie about a family that has a problem--- the females are witches. This movie is later on in the series and follows a budding witch into high school. Really cute for adults too.
4,hey,i like it because im so so into halloween especially this movie it is so cool. witches are cool. love it.
5,Awesome,This is a fun family movie andI would recommend it to anyone and it was just what I expected
2,Halloweentown High,I bought Halloweentown I & II and my grandchildren loved them. The third one did not keep their interest at all. It was not scary and the storyline was not exciting. I also purchased the 4th one but we have not watched yet. Hopefully it will be better.
2,Lacking the old spark,"Halloweentown and Halloweentown II were great fun,but upon watching this one,I was deeply disapointed.First of all,why the heck would you bring a bunch of monsters into your high school?And what happened to the old characters,like Benny and Gort?If you like it,thats fine,but its not a favorite of mine"
3,Not as magical as the first two.,"In this Halloweentown movie, Marnie is off to High School. It seems like the timeline is off a little (shouldn't Marnie be older than a freshman in High School?). The movie doesn't have any major scenes in Halloweentown, which is kind of wierd. The whole point of the series is Halloweentown! This installment did have a good plot, but was somewhat lacking the original Halloweentown magic."
3,HALLOWEENTOWN HIGH (2004),"I was always a fan of the HALLOWEENTOWN movies, I loved the first two when I was little but the thrid effort fails. It was a limp film that did not capture the magic of the original or even the sequel. You will most likely de dissapointed by it but its nice to see the triolgy getting a DVD release."
3,Get in the mood with Das Schutzenfest,"Worth alone for their excellent cover song, the rest of this short EP has a few oddities fans of FNM's bizarre humor might appreciate and an instrumental closer they will already know from Angel Dust."
2,"Great in one way, not so great in another...","When I first ordered these, I was thrilled! It is almost impossible to get fitted sheets that will fit the extra-long twin adjustable beds. Husband and I each have one, which I make the bottom sheets separate, and use one large flat sheet over them both. Well, these sheets DO fit great, and they stay on without wrinkling up for longer than 5 minutes. They also were great and soft for the first couple of washings...here is where the review goes downhill...they pill, and I mean pill! So, it is a catch-22...great fit, yet pill-y. Sigh..."
2,Rough & stiff,I ordered these to have an extra set of sheets around. They were really nice & soft when I took them out of the packaging so I was happy with my purchase. Until I took them out of the dryer. They're stiff & not soft at all.I'll only be using these when I absolutely must. Not a happy purchase at all.
2,Deep Pocket sheet,I have a deep matress and bought these based on the dimensions given in the description. When I got them they didn't fit over the matress even though they should have. I use them on a guest matress that is not a deep bed and they work out just fine.
4,Longest Cal King sheets around!,I have been searching forever for Cal King top sheets that don't come untucked after one night! These are the longest top sheets imaginable and have never come untucked. They are very soft and comfortable. Only downside is that the bottom/fitted sheet did start pilling after only a month. I plan to use my old fitted sheets with this set's top sheet which will be perfect. Just placed an order for my 2nd set of these sheets. You can't beat the price!
2,"No where as ""deep pocket"" as I expected. Cannot get fitted sheet to go down on all 4 sides.",Not as soft as expected. Fitted sheet nowhere as deep and large as expected. Does not fit on my king sized bed.
3,Good Bargain,"These sheets turned out to be a very good bargain. I am not sure they are exactly Cal King size because they were difficult to get on my pillow top. I may try the 600 count next time, because even after washing, they were still a little stiff."
3,average quality - not ultra soft.,"dissapointed in the quailty - but considering cali-kings are tough to find sheets for in many stores, glad these were available."
1,Very poor quality,Received these sheets. Very poor quality. Thin almost sheer. Threads hanging everywhere. Packaging them up and returning them ASAP. You will not be happy. Better sheets at TJ Maxx.
4,LinenSpa Egyptian Cotton Sheets,"I am very happy with these sheets. I have only had them on the bed for a about two weeks now, but so far so good. They washed up nicely, some wrinkles, which I ironed out. They are very soft and feel nice. The color is beautiful. Great value for a great product."
1,Generous but will pill,I was very pleased with the generous size of the sheets. They fit with room to spare unlike the sheets I bought from Select Comfort for my split king bed. After washing the sheets a second time they had small balls of fluff everywhere. BOOHOO
3,Amazon price lies,"If you go to the LinenSpa website, their price is only $80, so at $40 on Amazon, they're only half off; you're NOT saving $260."
1,Not the quality you'd expect at 400tc,"I purchased the 400 tc Egyptian Cotton bedsheets about 6 months ago, I am sorry to say, I've been pretty disappointed. They started to pill after the first wash.I've finally had to throw them out because they are too rough and uncomfortable to even keep as sheets for the guest bed."
3,Short lived sheets,"I ordered these sheets because of the 22"" depth. Anything less than that is a really tight fit on our mattress and won't stay tucked in. The fitted sheet was wonderful! The first time it went right on without any effort whatsoever. These sheets were a bit noisy, but that has decreased with washing. Unfortunately, after the first wash, the fitted sheet had shrunk considerably and was noticeably more difficult to put on the mattress. This condition worsens with each wash. You can't really beat the price on this sheet set; however, the shrinkage is intolerable and I'm going to have to buy new sheets long before these actually wear out."
1,NOT as described,"I ordered these sheets specifically because the information indicated that they would fit 22"" deep mattresses, and that the flat sheet was oversized as well. Imagine my surprise when my order arrived and the packaging indicated it would only fit up to a 20"" mattress! Since I paid $10 in shipping for them (and would have to pay more to send them back), I washed them and thought I'd give them a try. I managed to get the fitted sheet on my king sized mattress, but it isn't a good fit. Also, the flat sheet is incredibly small- it only overhangs the mattress by 3"" on each side. These are not good quality sheets either- they feel scratchy and cheap. I would have been better off going to a department store. I'm very disappointed with the sheet set, and with the description of the set on Amazon. If the description had been accurate, I never would have wasted my money on them."
2,Not Extra Deep at all!,"I've had these sheets since November 2010, bought so they would fit my California King Tempur-Pedic mattress, which is not all that deep. After just a few washings, the fitted sheet shrunk so much that it was quite difficult to make the bed...with time, the fitted sheet has shrunk so that now I must get rid of it. That said, I have not had any trouble with piling which has been mentioned by a number of reviewers, and the top sheet still fits quite nicely. But won't buy this brand ever again, cannot imagine trying to get it on a pillow-top mattress!!!"
4,Nice for the price,"I purchased these sheets as finding split king sheets is difficult. The deep pockets are a little too large for my Select Comfort mattresses, and the sheets come out of the dryer quite wrinkled. However, with repeated washing, the wrinkling seems to lessen. The sheets are soft and comfortable, and I like that the top sheet covers both mattresses with a decent hang on the sides.The cost for these was well under many sets on Amazon, and significantly less than if I had to purchase 2 twin fitted sheets, a king top sheet, and 2 pillowcases separately in a store. Even then finding single sheets is difficult as most stores carry only sets.Overall, a nice set."
3,Will Fit Extra-Deep Pocket!,"I was on the hunt for a difficult to find sheet--one that will fit my extra-deep mattress. LinenSpa 22"" sheet will fit those extra-deep Stearns & Fosters mattresses. The sheets felt soft and was the only sheet set in the four years I had my bed to actually fit all the way around. I am very pleased with this aspect. The color turned out to be fine--just as I saw on my computer monitor. I do have a high-end monitor, however. The only thing that I am not satisfied with (and why I give it only 3 stars) is the fact that after washing it 2 or 3 times the sheets (100% cotton) pill. This could be due to the way my husband sleeps. My side is fairly good; his side is very rough. I'd try this brand again in a blend or sateen finish and hope it doesn't pill."
2,Great fit but...,"I got these because I have a terrible time finding sheets that are both comfortable and fit my VERY deep, Cal. King mattress. While I can find deep pocket fitted sheets, the top sheet never makes it a quarter way down the side. I mean, if a company makes sheets to fit oversized mattresses...? Okay, off the soapbox.To my delight, these sheets, both bottom AND top, fit great and stay put. The issue I have is with pilling! One wash and I feel like I'm sleeping in sand. For the price, that's not worth it. I'll see if there's anything I can do, outside of shaving the sheets with a dull razor, to get the pills off.Too bad. The fit is wonderful."
1,Add not one jot...,"I am disturbed that the readers and writer of this series seem to be claiming that her writings are on a par with and expand upon the holy scriptures of the Bible. Her invention of incidents in the life of Christ is simply dangerous. Be careful, Satan is more clever than Man, and can lead us astray pretty easily.Remember, the Bible ends with the following admonition, quoted here from the end of the Book of Revelations:(NIV) Revelations 22:18-21: ""I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.He who testifies to these things says, ""Yes, I am coming soon.""Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen."""
5,A life changing encounter with the Son of God!,"I read the books over a three year period and have shared the books and stories with many people. When asked if I believed what I read, I said that it spoke to my heart - there is no doubt that the books are the inspired Word of God. But I also point out to prospective readers, even if you don't believe in the books' authenticity, it will still change your life!"
5,Do You Believe? Do You Doubt? Do You Need to Understand?,"For those who believe, this reading experience will only strengthen their faith! For those who have doubts and would like to learn and experience what it was like to live in the time of Jesus and to follow His life and truly experience His sacrifice and love for us, I recommend reading these books. If you cannot find or afford the five volume set than at least purchase the fifth volume and read it! You cannot help but be changed after this reading experience!"
5,"Fantastic guide to Beijing slang, although not for the beginner","I am surprised seeing so many negative reviews. This book is a gem, maybe the best that I have seen on the subject. Well organised and good selection of expression and texts. It is not a complete course to spoken mandarin but rather a quick guide to the most common colloquial expressions and slang used in Northern China or Beijing. The level is quite high, so perhaps most suitable for advanced learners looking to make their spoken Chinese more local. The audio recordings are a bit amateurish but this is a minor fault. Overall very good."
3,Very decent book for intermediate-advance chinese learners,"I like this book because each lesson is short enough. Conversation is lively and fun. It's simple enough to follow. A lot of idioms and expressions to learn from. Too bad diaglogues are not prepared with accompanying pinyin.I suggest for the ext edition in the vocabulary section, when vocabulary is read aloud in recording, English translation should be read also, not just madarin."
3,Product description is wrong,"It is 1/4 inch tubing and all accessories, not 1/2 inch. Repeat, there is no 1/2 tubing with this kit. The only way it differs from the much cheaper container kit (R552D) is that this one includes an automatic timer.After looking at reviews for the included timer here at Amazon, I would probably just get the cheaper kit at $20, and get a better rated timer from another company."
2,Constant leaking at tap kills it for me,"The included 75' of tubing provided a good amount of coverage to water everything around my pool deck. The included drippers work great and they plumbed in easily and quickly. Unfortunately though, as others have commented the faucet attachment portion leaks horribly and just ends up flooding my patio. If I can't fix it with a better O ring I am going to have to return it.Update: The valve failed after a few months and I called to get warranty service. They were very accusatory and nasty about replacing it, but they did send me a new one and honored their warranty. This replacement one just failed on me (again about 2-3 months after)."
4,"Easy set up, works well!","This is a lot easier to set up than you'd think looking at the directions on the back of the box. It's highly customizable, so as you get more plants, and want more extensions, they are easy to add. The connector to the faucet does drip at bit, but thats not a big deal. There is not a single leak of any sort in my 20x15 patio, so thats really what matters. I'm getting a second kit for my front yard too, its so simple. I found this product for $35 at Lowes."
1,Stopped working after a Week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Got the product hooked it up, and it worked fine for a week. Then product stopped working, tried changing batteries no help. Allmost killed 6 hanging baskets on my porch. Would not buy from raindrip ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Timer didn't last,We used to have two of these. After about a year both timers got stuck in the On position. A set of news batteries didn't help.Very convenient while it worked but I would recommend getting a more reliable timer than the the one included in this kit.
2,Cheaply made - doesn't work,"I bought this kit at a home improvement store and tried to install it in my container garden. The timer worked for less than a day, before the moisture got to it and ruined it. The larger hose is not flexible enough to go around corners and make turns - it is stiff, brittle and prone to crimping. The system leaked at almost every juncture. Even before I finished installing it, I ended up ripping it all out and just throwing it away. Back to the drawing board, hopefully this time with a higher quality product!"
4,Great product,It works great. Out of the box ...it had problems with leaking water through the connectors so i replaced those cheap plastic gaskets with rubber ones (same size as garden hose). It waters flowers regularly and they are blooming much better than before. I highly recommend this item.
3,PRETTY GOOD ... NOT GREAT,"SET UP WAS EASY ... BUT, THE ACTUAL ""DRIPPING MECHANISMS""(MEANING THE LITTLE END CAPS THAT DRIP INTO THE PLANTS) ARE FAULTY ABOUT 1/2 THE TIME ... AFTER I OPENED THE ""DRIPPING HOLES"" A LITTLE, THINGS WORKED GOOD ..."
4,"Great Product, Wrong Discription","This is a great product, which has made my gardening life so much easier when it comes to watering.With work, life and vacation, I never need to worry.But I do have to say, that the product discription needs to be updated.This is a 1/4"" hose not the 1/2"" as it states."
3,Good For First Time User,"Chose product for inexpensive water timer capability. Easy to assemble irrigation system and test of water flow was also easy. Rated 3 stars because water timer not very accurate. Also, accessories are not available at Amazon."
5,Has it All!,This kit has everything you could need to water your potted and/or small flowers in the ground. Highly recommend!
4,Good starter kit,"This is a good starter kit and very easily expandable with readily available items at Home Depot or Lowes. I have 15 large containers (tomatoes, peppers, etc.) and ended up buying 1/2 feeder hose and using the 1/4 inch hose in the kit to branch off to each container in order to maintain equal pressure to each plant. Still - it gets you started."
1,Very Stoppable Reading,"I was hoping this book would be enlightening, but after the first two chapters I was bored stiff and only could read ramblings that went on and on. I was sadly disappointed from what I had assumed to be a great book by it's description."
3,A Beneficial but Different Sort of Read,"Others here have described this book as a refreshing and new perspective. That's a good description. I confess this book took me a while to read and digest. I've read a lot of books on church leadership, but this one was not the average leadership book. McManus' communication style is not one I am used to and he did not use traditional terminology. This is not a bad thing, but was part of why it took me a little longer to read. He really knows how to tell a good story and how to put principles into pictures. On the other hand, McManus is somewhat light when it comes to drawing his principles from actual exegesis or theology. This is a great book for leaders in the church who do not want to do business as usual, but are feeling a stiring to take some courageous steps of faith."
3,I like the spirit...,I really like the spirit of this book. Don't get me wrong... Erwin and I have different ideas on theology and philosophy of ministry but his passion for the lost and the transformation of the Church from monument to movement is contagious. I hope people who may disagree with Erwin (we're on a first name basis) at least discern his heart about the issues he brings up.My reason for only giving it 3 stars is because it becomes a little repetitive and he's very vague on the exact changes that should be made.A good read for anyone who wants to change the world.
4,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Book,"This book, and the entire series, is great fun. I find myself unable to put them down. Here is a good story of teenage life, relationships, and romance that doesn't feel the need to fill its pages with sex and smut. The age suggested by the publisher is 12 and up. I suggest these books to anyone. I should know. I'm 20 years old, and to top it off, I'm an English major in college."
4,surperb!!!,"This book is just SURPERB! I am 11 and I think that these books are wonderful I could not wait to read #2 Reality Check.I recomended it to my friends and now they are hooked aswell. I got my dad to get me the rest. Anyway to the book,basicaly it talks about Kurt 'cause he has leukemia and everyone is hopeing for him to get well.He gets better but a tragic accident kills hope."
3,Get a Life,"Recently, I read the book Get a Life, by Laura Peyton Roberts. I rated this book a 3 because the author talks about real life problems. She talked about teenage romance and a boy that has cancer. Also, she made the descriptions very detailed. On the bad side, it was too confusing. The author kept switching whom she was talking about. As a result, I didn't know who was who. I recommend for people in middle school or high school to read this book. Also, if you like realistic fiction I recommend that you read this book. I think this age and interest group should read this book because it wouldn't be interesting if you were younger and it talks about teen romance."
3,Heartful story,It was the heartful story.Each person has each personality and life and differ from anyone.I thought that I only have to pursue my gorl with my pace from this novel.Thanks.
4,It was a very good book,This book made me want to read the next 5 one and the one after that. I hope that there will be like 10 more in the series.
5,A wondreful and inspirational book.,"I personally liked this book a lot. It has great detail where you almost feel like you're there. It makes you want to keep on reading more. The characters are all very unique and different. It is very wonderful how the book shows that eight people could be brought together because of one person and even maybe even stay friends. The book can be related to peoples own problems and lives because everything in the book is quite commom. The book is wonderful and Jenna, Peter, Ben, Melanie, Miguel, Jesse, Leah, and Nicole are very cool to read about. It is sad about Kurt, but it brought all eight people together. The book is great!!!!"
3,Good Overall,Good reference for sailboats. Lacks any negative feedback about any of the boats and also only lists boats made new during the publication.
4,Just plain good,I realy thought I had just another run of mill books until I started to read the story and it just got beter as the story progressed..
1,Wasted Effort,While the text provides some interesting information all the art work is in mostly poor black & white images. The book is a major disappointment.
1,Very Dull,"I think I am being generous with one star here.David and Steve excel in some genres but should stay away from pure environmental efforts. The waterfall/stream sounds on this CD are loud, harsh, and overdone. The sounds are monotonous and just go on and on and on until you just can't stand it anymore. I have a fair number of music/nature compilations so I know what I'm talking about...this one becomes just plain annoying after a while. There is nothing soothing or serene about it at all.If you are looking for the absolute best quality nature recordings blended with music, seek out any of Dan Gibson's work and go no further."
1,Very disappointed,"This CD was the absolute worst. I wish now I would have read all of the reviews. I purchased it based on the 4 Stars and the first review I read. I didn't take time to scroll down to the other reviews. The back ground harmonic sounds are ear piercing no matter how low the volume is. It is the most monotonous and irritating CD I have ever heard. I thought maybe it was just me, but my client literally came up off the massage table and was ready to leave if I didn't change the music. I really can't say enough about how irritating these sounds were. I'm so regretful that I spent the money on this and if I could exchange it or get my money back, I sure would. Lela Beer"
5,I have to agree! Amazing!,"This along withSoothing Sanctuaryare at the top of my current meditation list. This album in particular has a wonderful ""meandering"" quality about it that is perfect for searching for that inner quiet. A great find!"
3,good compilation album,"This is a surprisingly good compilation album. A good sample of the works on both 11:11 and SK. One thing that stands out, is that the best of both of these albums causes for a distinct lack of drag-which is a good thing. The only miss for me that really stands out is Pavlov's Daughter. Some of the other tracks are very charming, other are infectious. I would suggest getting this album as a starter, and then finding the album that it came from and then pursue the albums as a whole."
4,"So good mostly, and a little grating","Regina Spektor is a great artist because she seems to do just whatever the hell she wants with her music. Fortunately it is almost always beautiful, entertaining, poignant, etc. This album has a rawer sound than Far, definitely, and plenty of cussing...which could be a higher level of honesty, or just spite towards the editors. The songs are more creative than I could ever hope to be, so I enjoy them for their genius. They have a lot of classical-sounding patterns and progressions in them, combined with that layer of whatever-the-hell-she-wants and it makes for a surprising listen all the way through. Sweet, sweet music."
5,First-rate,"This album does not swing, but instead is an exceptionally well orchestrated album that is relaxing."
5,Excellent film from many angles,"I was really impressed and moved by this film. It uses some artistic liberty in telling the story of Maria Goretti but it remains faithful to the core of her life. Some films based on lives of Saints will take an unreal approach to its story and characters and I sort of expected it here, so I was really surprised by the strength of the writing, character development, and acting! Each member of the cast fully realizes his/her character. And even though you know and expect the ending, when it comes, you can't help but cry. It's a very touching and powerful portrait of Maria Goretti."
2,Had potential to be a great movie,"MARIA GORETTI had a tremendous cast, and with an excellent Marriconne musical score, this movie could have been outstanding. This story was more about the activist priest than about the subject of the movie, Maria Goretti.A poorly-written script that deflated quickly after the first ten minutes. There were many inconsistencies where the writer took too many liberties with the actual story. It seems that an Italian-made movie about an Italian saint would be a more accurate tribute. It was a made-for-TV movie in Italy, and maybe that's the explanation, however, this had the potential to be a much finer presentation."
5,Quite a Story!,"Since I was a little girl, I have known the story of Maria Goretti. I was thrilled to know that there was a DVD made of her life. The child star was perfect for the part...the story was heart-warming yet very sad. It was a true story, well-done!"
2,Dissappointed,"Very dull, no real insight. Maria Goretti's great act is of forgiveness and of how she lived in God's love despite a hard childhood, NOT that she fended off a rapist. What female wouldn't do as well. Maria's story is of reconciliation, peace, and love for all. Acting was poor, and I found the actress who played Maria to be the weakest."
1,Want mine?,"The first one I had mysteriously stopped receiving local channels, so they replaced it. The second one developed distorted tinny audio, and then a tendency to reset spontaneously. The screen goes gray, and then the box goes through a five minute satellite download cycle. That was real fun during game 7, inning 9 of the world series.The unit gets scorching hot, and I once had to reinsert the ID card several times to get it to come back to life. These and other experiences with DirecTV have completely weened me off of television over the last year, and frankly, I am not missing it."
1,Junk,"I have had two of DTV's HD receivers for approximately 10 months. I've had 5 service calls from techs, 2 boxes swapped out and i am currently having problems with both existing boxes. One box drops the sound and the other drops the picture first and then the sound, and must be rebooted to work again."
2,Failure is very common!,"I have had 4 including a HD DVR fail within the last 6 months! 2 were replaced, but when the other 2 failed within 1 week, I was told they now required a service man to come out and check, at my expense! ($49.00) I declined and shut them off. Like all big companies, the service does drop down. Still better than dISH."
2,Sling Shot Shot,I think this sling shot is o.k. but the magnet makes it hader to shoot smaller amo and is hard to shoot also .The rubber band gets tangled after shooting.
2,Lasted 2 days,Good design and adjustability however the sling/strap broke the second day of use which equals about 1 hour. We use it to shoot small milkbones over the fence to the coyotes. Great idea bad product.
5,Back in print at last!!!,"It's incredibly good news for the legions of Avram Davidson fans that this book is finally appearing in an easily accessible and, more importantly, *inexpensive* edition. Originally published in 1993 in fewer than 1,000 copies (of which I've been lucky to own one), it has been out of print for years. When used copies turn up they go for hundreds of dollars. And they seldom come up.As the seller of one of two copies of the 1993 edition available at this writing says in his description of the book: ""The last book by Avram Davidson published during his lifetime,a collection of erudite and digressive essays on mermaids, phoenixes, silk, dragons, and similar topics."" That pretty much sums it up, except to add that it's a great read. George Barr's accompanying illustrations sprinkled throughout the text are a delight, too."
3,Not really realistic!,Jessie Johnson is so excited about going to pony camp and cannot wait to ride. When she gets there one of her prissy classmates is there as well. Jessie's horse is not her dream horse and the book makes tacking up horses sound easy. Riding is so much fun and this book makes it sound horrible and boring. The swimming scene in the end did not fit in.
4,Sublime and entrancing.,Let Andy's music embrace you. Further examples of his unique style and Carribean/South American flavor. Do yourself a REAL favor and attend one of his concerts. The experience is delighfully surreal! A treat for the ears and eyes.
5,Gr8 Quality Photo Paper!!,"What can you say about photo paper?....It's hardly anything thrilling to write about, isn't it?...Anyway....Here goes!! My pics & projects turned out wonderfully because of the paper's premium quality!! OK!! That's my review of HP Premium Photo Paper!! I highly recommend it!!! But, all jokes aside, just don't get too carried away with all your printing projects, because ink is quite costly, no matter what kind of paper you use.....Enjoy!!!"
1,Did not work for me,"My daughter has an ipod Mini and a stereo with an Ipod Dock. The Ipod Mini would not play on this stereo, although it could be charged(hmmm). I bought this hoping that her Mini would be able to play, but it didn't. So, this product is useless to me. Hope that I can return it for a full refund, including shipping."
1,Disappointing,"I brought this book to Kenya and found it to be disappointing and incomplete. Many of the words and phrases (including such simple things as greetings!) are inaccurate, obscure or out-of-date. It doesn't even include ""Jambo!"" the most ubiquitous Swahili greeting and the only word most tourists learn.Along with providing many poor choices (which were incomprehensible to the kenyans I met), the book didn't provide enough context to help you correctly choose your words or phrasing. Also -- and more importantly -- the grammar section is incomplete and impossible to follow. Swahili grammar is very different from English, and it's impossible to gain ANY proficiency in the language without at least a basic briefing in grammar.At the end of my trip, I bought the Lonely Planet Phrasebook, which was infinitely better, and everything started making sense. And no, I don't work for Lonely Planet."
2,get what you pay for,"I was ecstatic to find a double stroller cover for so cheap, but it's very poor quality plastic and has already torn. Does not stand up to the elements, and I'm quite dissappointed. It fit great though."
1,Rain cover ripped,"I recieved the item timley, however it was ripped and It could not be used. I thre it away. I still do not have a rain cover. So one star is all it gets."
3,dan,"Okay for the price, but thin plastic tears easily, and we have to just keep taping the tears. We have one for our single jogger that we bought at babysRus several years back, and have had no such problems with."
4,Overall a good book.,"I believe that One Last Wish by Lurlene McDaniel is an excellent book, in that it gives people the piont of veiw of what it is like to be sick or dealing with a really tough health issue. Usually people can't understand how people are feeling, until they have experienced it themselves, but this shows how people feel, so others don't have to guess."
3,CCNA prep mistake,"This is a good book, but not great, I am an IT professional and use Cisco all day ansd live in the IOS was looking for a book to help me get ready for the CCNA this isnt it.... Look into the sybex book by Lammle"
3,"Agree with Ivana, buy the Sybex book too.","This book does not cover the exam and sticks too close to the Cisco ICND course, which the exam does NOT! Get the Sybex book instead or in addition to this book. Oh, I bought the Sybex CCNA e-trainer and it worked great with both books."
5,Outstanding insight into the Life of a Modern Muslim woman,I think this book provided wonderful insight into the life of modern American Muslim women. This would be a great book for those who are non-Muslim and wondering about the reasons for the conversion of many American women to the wonderful religion of Islam. I think this book is a must read!!
3,Easy Read: Islam,"I enjoyed reading about the different women that came into Islam. I liked the honesty of the stories. I am really amazed at this mother who chose to present different women coming into Islam. It was an easy read for me. I still have this book and I bought this book a few years back when I came into Islam. I believe reading stories about women coming into Islam brings a new perspective about Islam and women. Many times people say women are oppressed in Islam, but when reading different accounts from women it shows the total opposite. Many people need to read about Islam and not about cultural norms. Many times people pick up a book and automatically think its Islamic or apart of Islam, but this could very well not be the case because every culture is going to have it's own norms. This is not the case for this book. Nice read!"
2,Old and busted,"I have always found this book to be cumbersome, difficult to navigate, poorly organized, and lacking in sufficient detail. But of course for years it was basically the only game in town, so everyone relied on it. Those days are over. I recently purchased Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards, and it is an outstanding book. If you're trying to decide which one to buy, definitely get Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards instead. And even if you already own Time-Saver Standards, do yourself a huge favor and buy Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards anyway. It covers everything that Time-Saver Standards does plus numerous other topics, all with much better explanations and details. To top things off, it has FAR more graphics and the entire book is better organized an easier to navigate than Time-Saver Standards."
3,Great Book poor service,"The product I received is great, especially because I'm a student, it has quick references for almost all of the information I need. It has great little sketches and all kinda of information I need.It took almost week longer than said April 16 -May 3 was my expected delivery date and I did not receive it until May 11. I felt that the 18 day shipping window was too broad for it to have still come late."
4,A Great Beginner's Handbook!,I graduate college a couple of years ago and started working in the securities industry (The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp). This book has assisted me tremendously in understanding with not only the function of DTCC but also the US Securities Industry as a whole!
2,Too Fundamental for me,"The book might have been a help thirty years ago. I was surprised by the recent publication date. These days even the fundamentals have become more complex. Most of the questions I need answered were not addressed. Unless you don't even know what a bond (for example) is, you do not need this book."
5,Working great.....,"I replaced my worn tensioner pulley when an idler pulley disintegrated on my '03 GMC Sierra HD2500 diesel. I also replaced the other idler pulley as well. Although the mounting tangs on the back of the pulley were not exactly as my original, it is working great. The original had one circular tang on the bottom and one elongated at the top to mate with the engine block. This pulley has two circular mounts protruding but fits without a problem. It may be made this way to work with several different vehicles."
5,Entertaining at its best!,"Williams Sonoma has put together another ""must own"" for anyone who entertains! This book covers not only recipies (broken down into specific menus), but also table setting ideas, floral arranging, wine suggestions (VERY helpful) and napkin folding for the extra special touches sure to make your next get-together a unique and much talked about occasion! Highly recommended!"
5,Fantastic CD,I have borrowed this cd from a patient friend for a number of years and finally decided it was time to buy my own copy. I have always liked hearing drums played. The skill of the drummer in combination with the native american melodies makes for an outstanding album. Some pieces are mellow and others have a more pronounced beat. All are great. My cd arrived very quickly and was in excellent condition. This is one of my favorite albums.
5,Wonderful,This CD was playing in the background during my Reiki Master course and my attunements and it is truly wonderful. I will always keep this musical pearl close to my heart since it is truly one of my biggest favourites! I can recommend it to anyone who likes native rhythms and sounds of nature in a soft ambient musical surrounding.
1,Indian Welk,"Although this may sound pleasant to some people I would imagine it's an insult to others. Just another example of the exploitation of the true Americans. It's like there was a Lawrance Welk of native American music only worse. An equivelant might be buying a Metallica cd and hearing Madonna music coming from the speakers. You expected something with some real spirit but you got watered down syrupy bubblegum music instead. It's not the real thing. Besides that I'm a professional drummer, and I'm definitly not impressed with the drumming. But having said that, if you just want some pop music to listen to and delude yourself that your listening to real native American music then this is for you.It would probably be better to rename it and put a different picture on the cover that would be less insulting to the people it's making a mockery of and more suitable to the disco minded crowd it's apparently trying to foster."
4,Cute Halloween movies for kids,"This is a fairly typical made for TV movie, but that doesn't make it bad, it's actually a pretty cute and fun film. The kids are not allowed to celebrate Halloween because of their mom, but then Grandma comes and reveals an amazing secret - that she is a witch and that the children have magical powers, but that these powers had to be recognized/activated before their thirteenth birthdays (the oldest child is almost 13) Resentful, the girls go with Grandma against Mom's wishes, and have a blast in Halloweentown as they try to figure out what is going on, and learn a few things about their family history.The sequel isn't bad, but the first movie is definitely better. Overall a pretty fun movie for kids."
4,Hurricane Sandy arrived in NJ,Everything arrived in good order but Halloween was cancelled and we were without power for almost 2 months. So there is always next year.
4,Halloween Classics,"I'm glad these 2 films have come out on video. They're something anyone would enjoy. You become interested in the Cromwell Family from the first video, and the story becomes more interesting as the films progress. Fpr instance, Marnie's mom doesn't like Halloween; the film tells you why."
4,Straberry's Mom,"10/21/05Halloween Town 2 was a great movie that was related to the first. The special fetchers are great and so is the story. It is about Kalabar's son named Kale who tricks Marine into giving him her grandmother's spell book. If you don't get it then watch the movie yourself.Maggie H., 4th grader, Holland, PA"
4,great,Good movie fast delivery my soon to be 6 year old loves the movies. She was excited that I bought bought them for her
2,Movies,I got my package a week late. Then the movie wasn't even I the DVD slot. It was floating around in the case. The packaging was way to large and even partly opened when I got it.
3,For Experts Only,"This book is not an overview of popular cinema of the Nazi era. It is an examination of 9 separate topics pertaining to the popular cinema of the 1933-45 era. While these chapter/essays are arranged in chronological order, reading this book does not give anyone a cohert picture of what Nazi Popular Cinema was like.Some of the essays are good, such as the one on two comedies of 1933 and the fate of Nazi era actors after the War. However, the more abstract the topic of an essay, such as how set design reveals attitudes toward ""modernity,"" the less interesting it is for the general reader curious about the topic of Nazi Popular Cinema.Thomas Elsaesser's ""The Ministry of Illusion"" or (to a lesser extent) ""Entertaining the Third Reich"" would be far more helpful to the American reader who is seeking to understand the controversial films of the Nazi era."
3,Lotions are better,"Loved the lotion version of this, however, the oil itself is a bit too strong in smell - like melting candy on your skin except in a very very tooth-decaying kind of way. Worse yet, in one hot summer day, I woke up hot and sweaty and it broke me out.Absolutely love the lotion - right amount of scent, right amount of moisture."
1,Rip off - does not work,"- Unit was defective, it did not turn on initially then after adjusting batteries it started beeping and did nothing (even after adjusting sensitivity which is the only control available on unit).- It was not the unit described on website. There is no digital/analog switch, no belt clip, did not detect anything except continuous beeping. This item looks and feels like $1 mini radio from dollar general store.DO NOT BUY......RIP OFF"
1,Horrible,"This book was extremely difficult to read. It was literally a struggle just to reach the end of the first page. Not being a philosophical engineer, I was not able to determine what was happening most of the time. The sad thing is that CJ is usually a very good author, but this book was just terrible."
4,An even better read when paired with a good historical book,"Seemed like a good time to re-read (probably for the 4th time) after finishing the Worst Hard Time by Timothy Egan. The characters still ring true, and having more of a historical background made this great novel even more powerful"
3,WidgetsExplorerPack125-Eval_for_5YrOldBoy,"Our 5 year-old grandson enjoyed the Widgets Starter Set, so we bought him the Explorer Pack. It was a great disappointment for him, as he could not assemble the complex models shown in the Instructions, and would get frustrated at the difficulty of wedging blocks (with his little 5-year old hands). Conclusion: the Models shown are much too difficult for little ones. There should be a lot more simple models with simple assembly. This set is suited for children much older."
5,A fascinating and detailed work of historical fiction,"""Sgt. Bellnap's Secret"" chronicles the life of corrupt Washington lobbyist, Leon Placke, as he uncovers and conceals several historical documents, which threaten the careers of many political bigwigs. Haunted by several visions of historical figures, Placke mends his ways with tragic results. Mr. Reiner's novel is a combination of fine historical research, a bulls-eye view of today's political climate, and a page turning tale of tragedy and redemption. This novel effectively demonstrates how government has failed its constituents by ignoring the lessons of our founding fathers, a lesson few of us can afford to ignore."
5,Fantastic and Outstanding CD By Frankie Ford,"Frankie Ford is an Icon and a fantastic entertainer. He should have been into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame long before now. The Big Boys at the Hall of Fame they usually recognize the big stars when they are long gone and are not here anymore to share in their achievements. With Frankie's New CD ""That Can Be Used Again"" it is a work of art. Frankie recorded two of my songs I wrote. ""Lady Waiting"" and ""Whenever I"" and he did an outstanding job performing my songs. So as I critique his latest works it is outstanding. And what a fantastic CD that should be listened and purchased by anyone who likes music. Frankie Ford is the best."
2,when watching these you will be the first out . . . of the room,"I certainly wasn't expecting any lurid, overtly sexual context in this set. I was, however, expecting more than the nebulous contact noticed here. A little more heat would be desirable for any future releases by those involved in this production. It was a good effort. simply one that fell on its face and never got up."
5,"Stimulating, Provocative Discussion of the Mind and Memory","I really enjoyed this book. Dr. Khalsa has apassion for his work that carries over into hiswriting. In straightforward fashion he moves from a very good discussion of how the brain works to a well organized plan for how anyone can employ nutritional, stress reduction, and exercise techniques as well as pharmacological therapies to prevent brain degeneration, optimize performance, and even reverse the course of such conditions as age related memory loss and Alzheimer's disease. I began reading this book to educate myself. I came away a ""convert"" to Dr. Khalsa's program. He convinced me to make some lifestyle changes that no doubt will enhance my overall well being and quality of life. I can think of no higher praise for a book than this"
5,Amazingly Insightful,"Dr. Khalsa has some amazing insights into our health. He has confirmed for me the things I'm discovering about my body and the American health system. Before reading his book, I was already doing the majority of the things for his Brain Longevity Program, but found that even at 34 yrs old, I was starting to have some memory issues. As he vividly describes the functions of the brain, various body chemicals, I think my excessive exercise has caused high cortisol levels. I will integrate his medicinal tonics and mind/yogic exercises to complete the program and begin doing that within the next couple weeks. I'm looking forward to improving my memory, brain functions. I love his case studies where he gives examples of all walks of life. This book is very well-written!!!"
5,very informative,"I have learned alot, besides helping my knowledge about the workings of the brain in reference to nutrients. I know this info. will help my mom and dad coping with their ageing problems. I have a book and mailing one down to them in Fla.. I am going to hi-lite pertinent info. Thanks. Joe"
2,"Well written, factual and interesting.","This is a well written, interesting and easy to read book. The explanation on how the brain works was a revalation, and the guidelines for preventing brain degeneration should be compulsive reading. My main impression is that prevention should begin at the earliest possible stage. One criticism is that Dr.Khalsa occasionally made wild assumptions. For example, that telelphone numbers were a specific length so that people could remember them easily. In fact the size of a phone number reflects the number of people who need phones and this is growing with the advent of the internet and mobile phone numbers. But, I suppose this is a growing field and we all have a lot to learn."
1,Inaccurate information about how the brain actually works,"According to the information that is accessible to me about how the brain works, this book provides inaccurate facts.In The Amazing Brain by Robert Ornstein et al. we are told that the information moves from the axon to the dendrites.Brain Longevity says that the information moves from the dendrites to the axons.Does the author know something new about brain function?"
4,Alternative meets mainstream,"Refreshing to find an MD who is open to scientific knowledge not controled by the AMA and the Pharmaceuticals. The author does a good job of summerizing the efficacy of drugs available and safely used in Europe by the anti aging crowd for years but denied by the FDA. A Google search will take you to the sources to buy via the internet. Yoga, nutrition, exersice and vitimin/mineral supplement info and effect is artfully presented with a scientific explaination as to why it works. Clinical evidence is presented as necessary for credibility."
5,must read,"Khalsa is very knowledgeable, describing improvements that range from 100% transformation of the individual to modest improvement, which is worth any cost.Scientifically sound and fascinating reading. I recommend it to everyone."
2,Needs an Update,"Before using any of the supplements indicated throughout this anecdotal book, I would need to check recent scientific tests that showed many supplements to be ineffective. This book has a lot of marketing of the doctor's treatments and does not seem trustworthy. A complete revision seems is order. I bought it because a friend who used it when it was first published did find it helpful, but she also tried many other things and worked with a local doc."
5,awsome! awsome! awsome!and fun.,i am bratz biggest fan. i'm planning to get it for christmas.but i really don't like it when they made twiinz with valintina and oriana.i guess they want kids to make choices.ethier want twiinz or triiipletz.my opinion.anyway this toy is awsome!i perfer triiiplets.'cause i already have twiinz.this time i want something different.and that is different.i always wondered if they would come out with bratz triiiplets.they rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Triiipletz,"They release them as twins and then OMG! remembered they had a third sister, making them triplets? That just doesn't make sense! Although I guess it makes the original twin release collectible?Dumb."
1,"Great program, Lousy video","I have been to 2 Appleseed events so far and I plan to go to many more. I was hoping to use this video to loan out to my friends resulting in bringing them to an Appleseed event as well. It looked like it was made by a reputable production company and I expected a documentary/instruction sort of video but what I got looked more like someone's vacation home-movies. The production was mediocre at best with occasional sound problems (mostly caused by wind but that should have been edited out). I understand that they did not hire actors but they could have done some additional 'takes' offline to make a better product. The DVD was purple on the bottom (manually burned) and printed with an inkjet printer. For the price, I expected more.Thanks to Amazon for a simple return process. My only loss was some time and disappointment."
5,"Easy to Read, Full of Information","This textbook is packed full of information, but is integrated with numerous examples and pictures making it read fast and painless. It is well organized, and was a useful tool for me in my public speaking class."
4,Not Surround,"This is indeed a fine sounding disc, but it's not surround and it does not require a DVD-Audio player. The tracks are stereo 24bit/96kHz, which play fine in most DVD-Video players.This is probably Leon Russell's best album, and the hi-res remaster is by far the clearest sound I've ever heard for this title (that includes the original vinyl and the CD). If you can afford the out-of-print prices, it's a must-purchase for LR fans."
2,Dining Room Chairs,I waited a long time for the delivery of the chairs but luckily they came before Thanksgiving. To my dismay one of the chairs had to be returned because the legs were wobbly...the replacement chair took forever...now I am finding 9 months later that the two chairs out of six that we use the most are now also wobbly. They are beautiful chairs but I don't know how long they will last.
4,"practical, and to the point","This book is written for people who counsel others (psychologists, sociologists, psychiatrists, etc.). It was written as a very practical guide for those who do ""short term"" therapy, typically consisting of only 3 or 4 sessions.It gives scenarios, and solutions. The author is unapologetic with the language, (in other words, he can be very BLUNT.) This however doesn't detract from the valuable teachings contained therein.I like its brevity, and lack of ""fluff."" The author gets right down to business and stays there."
1,Disappointing Book,"This book was very disappointing. The idea behind the techniques is a good one, however the execution and context of these is off. They come across as disrespectful and patronizing. The authors' style of presentation of the material is annoying as well."
1,medicore at best,"As a therapist I was excited about possibly learning some great techniques...Most of this stuff is real airy-fairy, bordering on New Ager stuff....Not real life useful techniques..."
5,Not just another nature versus nurture book,"So many nature versus nurture books came out during the late nineties and early 2000s. Ridley, Pincher, and many others have written interesting and quite different books on the subject. All of them are pretty good and, interestingly, differentiate themselves well from the others. This book by Paul Ehrlich, HUMAN NATURES, sets itself apart from the others not by presenting the skull of Phineas Gage, which almost all of them discussed, but in wonderful discussions on race--of which there's really no such thing--cultural evolution, and his gargantuan reading lists and endnotes. With a thumbs-up by none other than Jared Diamond, it's a far harder task to avoid this book than to buy it and read. Well, you won't be disappointed reading this book. Highly recommended... - lc"
1,biased crap,This book is too biased to take seriously. The author's good intentions and politically correct stance skew the truth that shows from the scientific facts listed in the book. The author will say one thing then a couple of sentences later will say the exact opposite. Unreliable crap.
5,Fascinating Book!,"Paul Ehrlich does a great job of looking at why we humans are the way we are. He explodes a lot of the myths about genes being the sole determinate of agression, peacfulness, and many other things that we attribute to genes. Even after I took a break from reading I found myself thinking of the concepts that he states, and I couldn't wait to get back to the book. His views of sexuality are very thought provoking."
4,Another Great Cd By The Crabb Family,"The Crabb Family along with The Talley Trio are my favorite groups. All 13 songs are written by the father of these singers, Gerald Crabb, who is an extraordinary songwriter. I really enjoy 9 of the 13 songs. This cd has nice upbeat songs, ""Greater Is He"" and ""The Walk"", and also nice slower songs like ""The Cross"", ""I Could Tell You Had Forgotten"", and ""Lend A Hand"". Overall a great cd that you can play again and again. I think my favorites are ""Wounded Soldier"" and ""Who Will Survive The Storm"". Their singing is as always very soulful. The lyrics are great."
3,Kinda boring.,"After reading the autobiographies of Aerosmith and Motley Crue, this was pretty boring. They take the whole 'artist' aspect out of being a rockstar. Rather than four guys doing what they love and getting lucky, it's Gene & Paul starting a business called ""Kiss"" and hiring two other guys who passed their interview. These two men would be resources to help the company reach it's goal of making it's members rich. When they became too much to 'manage', they were let go and replaced.The only interesting rockstar-like thing they do is bang a bunch of women, but they barely mention that in this book. Cool, if you're a fan or if you've run out of Ambien."
2,Not that exciting,"If you are looking for historical information on how the band was formed and the background into the songs...then this this is your book. If you are looking for the dirt behind the concerts, band members, drugs and sex...you will not find it in this book"
2,Just ok,"Thought this would have a lot of potential to be a great tell all. It ended up reading more like a book about how great Kiss is/was. Gave me the feeling that Gene and Paul edited the book and only allowed certain details. The book repeated itself a lot. A better choice should be The Dirt, or Walk This Way."
3,Flow and printing errors,At times the flow of paragraphs was confusing and out of sequence. And some words were combined within the body of sentences. But I did enjoy the book in its entirety.
4,kiss biography,"interviews done with kiss before they "" sanitized"" their history. interviews stated in '79, then diskography of later kiss disks."
2,"Imagine a $50,000 Miata; Enjoyable but a Lousy Value","Car Talk's been on the air for a long time, and they must have plenty of great material for compilations like this. Unfortunately, what went on this edition, while funny enough, just isn't worth the high price. Save your money for blank cassettes and just record the regular show is my advice."
5,GRINDING,"The song WAITING, is, lets say the kind of song that you will listen over too again and again. No lie! The thing is this, it is great back ground music, but if you have a FULL-STEREO System at home or like to listen on GOOD HEAD-PHONES, it will shine and get you caught up in it. GREG"
2,"Cute, but didn't fit my small head","I have a hard time finding hats that fit my head. Apparently it's smaller/narrower than the avg head :-( I bought this because I thought it was really cute. When I got it, it was really cute, but when I tried it on, it was too loose, so I had to return it. It your head doesn't fit the hats like this at Target, this probably won't fit you. Fit the same as those ones."
5,Good quality but stiff!,"Our dogs chewed up my wife's hat and this was the only one I could find with out the compression band. Yet, after washing it, it still feels stiff. My have to rock wash it."
1,Don't buy this unless you have a huge head..,My heads not small nor big and this item does not fit mg head at all falls right down on my face. Don't waste your money..
2,holey hat,"For some reason there were a bunch of wear holes in this hat. Not what we were looking for, but it could be what someone else wants."
3,TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Tarzan - Volume One DVD,"Hey, it's 5-Time Undefeated Olympic Gold Medalist Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan - what else needs to be said?The disc quality is good at best, with fair sound and picture. My main beef with the disc is that the movies are NOT in widescreen, and have been edited somewhat for content."
5,Original (colorized) full versions,"Nice to get four movies in one pack for a decent price. I used to watch these on Saturday mornings while folding clothes, so it was nice to see them again."
5,An Endearing Collection of Cat-Keepers!,"I fell in love with the beautifully photographed cats and kittens in this wonderful calender. Wish there were more like this! I even have the cover picture on my wall, near my bed, to help me relax (as this darling kitten is doing) and fall asleep. Kudos to the camera man and cats both!Anna Marie Fritz, author of ""Funny Feline Fotos,"" and other amazon books."
4,Cute,"This calendar is cute, but a little plain. You get the standard cute cat pictures for each month, but the format of the months is nothing special and not in any way decorative. Each month is a plain white format. Still, it's just a calendar, so 4 stars."
3,Billy Who ????,"I must say I was a little hesitant to purchase this title for my 15 year old who is starting out on drums. I didn't even know that NSYNC had a drummer, but he seems to like the video (which makes me believe my money was well spent). The play-a-along CD that comes with the video seems to be the best part of this video. He always puts it in his system and plays along."
3,Berry Interesting...,"On this DVD, Strawberry Shortcake has grown up and can drive a car... and then travel around the world with her friends. There are some new characters I'm not familiar with, such as Banana Candy, Peppermint, Tea Blossom and Tangerina to name a few. Not my favorite Strawberry Shortcake DVD, but still berry cute and teaches positive messages. So far my favorites are ""Berry Blossom Festival"" and ""Let's Dance"". Overall, I would recommend this DVD for any Strawberry Shortcake fan."
4,Funny,"This is no better or worse than the other ""middle years"" Strawberry Shortcake videos, which all have relatively good story ideas, funny dance sequences, and amusingly well-developed musical scores by Andy Street, who clearly knows what he's doing. In the stories, the girls are always sort of fighting with each other, which will certainly give the dads a laugh and make it easier to watch the requisite 100s of times. Avoid the newer series, in which the characters all look, sound, and act the same and the music is bland."
1,Slow Read,"This was a slow read, as the reader has to contend with typos and questionable grammar structures throughout the book. There also seems to be a lot of bad language just for shock value. These problems served to be a distraction from the plot, which showed more promise than it eventually delivered. The book is also over-priced, but that is apparently normal for this type of publishing house. The writer shows promise, just needs to work with a legitimate publisher and get some editing help."
5,Lynn's Review,Have been buying the First North Americans series for my adult daughter. She has encouraged me to read them also. We are both pleased with Michael & Kathleen Gear's series. Nicely written. It holds one interest and invites you to read and re-read each book.
5,Great storytelling,The Gears are really great storytellers of an era that we know very little about. They get you into a story and grab your interest to the point that you have to know what happens next. So far I have read 9 books in the series and have not been disappointed once.
3,ok but came late,Ordered it for halloween it didn't come in time for my party so I bought another one then it came the next day :(
1,A book to promote the author?,"This book doesn't help to understand why there was a war for water and seems that it tries to layout that because of the Water War Evo Morales is President or something like that. If the author has a personal problem to be recognized for what he did, please don't write a book, go a press interview. Lost my time reading this book."
3,Not assorted colors as advertised,It says a set of 5 with assorted colors but they are all yellow. It's not a big deal but I wanted assorted colors.
5,Donna White's Beginning Golf for Women,As a beginning golfer this video was very helpful and help clear up several issues .I am a person that has to see it to understand and this video did it for me.Well done and easy to understand.Helped with my grip and swing and made for a women beginner..I highly recommend it.
5,A must have for any Computer Graphics developer,"Packed full with many interesting solutions to problems in Computer Graphics developed by active researchers in the field, this is a must have for any serious Computer Graphics program developer."
2,"Good songs, bad mix","The songs are great. The musicians are fantastic and the vocalists are capable (despite the occasional sour note), but the mix ruins this album for me. The drums desparately need more and better compression, and the choir consistantly overrides the music. In fact, the choir is so loud compared to the music that I cannot comfortably listen to this CD. That's unfortunate because when judged only on the songwriting and performance this album would have merited at least 3 stars or perhaps even 4."
1,If I had it to review!!!!,I ordered it several weeks ago and have not received it yet! I would think that you would make sure I got it before you ask for a review....
5,Pink Floyd meets the Cure,"guitar playing that's sonic,atmospheric,and gentle with a angel singing the vocals.a collection of hippie guitar work and etherial music that's refreshing yet sincere.can't get enough of it-can't wait 'til the next one comes out."
1,RIP Bill Blass,"Both the designer and the fragrance are gone. If you're lucky, you'll get one of the last bottles of the original. I'm glad I stashed away two of them. I tried to acquire another online, and it turned out to be the reformulated version--a pale shadow of its former self. If you like designer knock-off fragrances, the new version will do. If you were around in 1978 and want to cherish a good scent memory, the new version of this fragrance will disappoint just like all the other old classics that the perfume industry has watered down.It had oakmoss in the base. That's probably one reason they changed it. The wicked perfume cops decided that consumers need to be protected from oakmoss. Thank you, but I'll decide for myself whether or not to use a product if it gives me a rash."
1,Do not bother with them,"After a single use, the gloves ripped on the right index finger. My gloves usually last a full season, these did not last through one single workout. I was excited to get these gloves only to have to archive them after one use. I will definitely think twice before I purchase Reggie Bush gloves again."
5,How about 10 stars!!,This is by far the most informative and encouraging book I have read on this subject.
3,Few diagrams,"You will find few visuals in this book. I need diagrams that help show how to massage the lymph glands..Information mostly in written form, not visual"
1,Maybe I'm missing something...,"640 x 480, 30fps, 24 bit color. Sounds great! I bought the camera with the idea of using it as a long duration digital camera. (2-6 hour seminars) I didn't expect wonders, but this thing (is not imprssive)!I finally captured in color using Fire-I software from the web, and then Windows Media Encoder. It still only captures at 7.5fps. Granted, it takes 4 shots of the same frame to make 30fps, but it's still 7.5fps (it just takes up 4 times the space.)Fire-I could capture 640x480, but WME was stuck back at 320x240. The preview seems to be 30fps, but the capture isn't.The hardware MIGHT be OK, but the software sure isn't. I'd say it borders on false advertising. My search for decent drivers/software to make this work will continue. Without it, this thing is a waste of money."
1,Don't waste your time with this one...,"Don't purchase this product. It's a waste of money. I'm still using it, but I wish I had the extra cash to get a different walkman. The case is bulky and heavy. The radio and tv tuners often produce static. The cassette player plays poorly and often reverses direction in the middle of playing a cassette. Also, sometimes, it plays cassettes slowly and not up to normal speed. Overall, I am disappointed with the quality of this product for such a high price. SONY has made some really poor electronic products lately, and I have stopped purchasing any of their electronic products. They must be concentrating too much on the PLAYSTATION to drive their company sales."
5,Ranks as one of the best books I ever read,"I enjoyed this book immensely. I read it over ten years ago, but it was a memorable book just the same. Also, enjoyed Sentenced to Prizm by the same author."
4,Porcelain handles not included,"We purchased and have installed this faucet approximately 1 week ago and it works fine, but the photo on this website shows it with porcelain handles. Those are sold separately. It comes only with the Chrome handles. It's very nice, but just be aware of that."
4,A Great Read!,"I first read Maxine Hong Kingston's Woman Warrior when I was in 10th grade and I fell in love with it! I am Asian American myself and I could relate to various aspects in the novel. However, a lot of the novel can be confusing so I was not sure if I had gotten enough out of it. So, when I saw this book, I had to buy it! I wanted to know her thoughts and feelings about the book and everything else. I was not disappointed! This was a great supplement to her novels and a great read in general. If you are a fan of Maxine Hong Kingston, this is a definite must have!"
3,pants too short for 5'7,"(Writing this on my boyfriends account) Pants are too short for 5'7 and taller. Size 3 is true to size, however wearing heels with pants looks silly. Also pants are very flared and a little too wide legged for me. I thought about returning them but they look alright with flats. I got them for work so its not that serious but heads up if youre taller than 5'7, these are not for you."
3,Run very small!,"I've always been a size 5, but I ordered up just in case. Even then they were extremely small on me. The style and fabric was fine, but I was upset that a size up still ment 3 sizes too small."
3,small,"had to return, cut too small. nice quality pants. the sevens for me will be too big. overall the pants are really nice. excellent material nothing cheap about them."
1,DID NOT FIT,"TOO SMALL!Returned them, also they were baggy from the thigh down but the waist was too small...I'm actually in good shape and these pants were just strangely made, in my opinion. Perhaps a size up, but then the pants would have been VERY baggy in the legs and not like the picture."
2,sizing is bad,Not true to size. Cut too small. Also too short. Returned for credit--did not ask for exchange. Maybe next time.
5,I want more!!,I love these -they are easy wash and wear -did not have to iron look great comfortable I want more!
4,Lots of light for your cash,"This is probably the fastest wide zoom you'll find for 200us$It's not as sharp, wide or as fast to autofocus as the Pentax 16-50 SDM, but this will get you a long way for a lot less."
4,sharp after adjustment,i purchaced this lens and found it to be well built. after some testing i found it to front focus so bad that i couldn't adjust it on my K20D with the in camera focus adjuster. i took the lens to the sigma usa site with the k20d body. 20 min later they gave the lens back and now it is as sharp as my pentax DA* lens. i think that you jump at this lens at this price. if you have a problem sigma will back it up. this was the second time i went to sigma with a lens and walked out with a perfect working lens in less than a half hour.
5,"Excellent video, most helpful!",My friends and family learned alot watching the video. It does give you hope!
2,Disappointing!,"While this video could give hope to parents of newly diagnosed children, it delivers very little information about the new laws. Only references to the law being passed and why the law is needed are mentioned in the video. It lists sources at the end of the video where you can get additional information, however, a quick online search can deliver the same for a lot less money."
3,Autism & The New Law. Resources for Treatment. Hope for a Cu,"I found this video vague and not very helpful. It shows the passing of the new laws but not how it effects the individuals. The list on references/sources can be found on any Autism publication. For good general information on Autism I suggest the book, ""Autism, Facts and Strategies for Parents"" by Janice Jansen. This is an excellent source for Parents of newly diagnosed children as it is bias to treatment. For informational videos try the University of Indiana web site who list hundreds of video on Autism, brief synopsis of each and how to obtain them. Jayne, Mother of 3 y/o boy w/autism"
5,"Did not expect it, but loved it!","I really love the cast in this movie so I decided to buy it. I was not expecting this movie to be as crazy as it was! But in all honesty I think it was well done, and I really enjoyed it."
2,Asi del principio,This movie is a very realistic example of how many young adults live. But I find too strong and too X-rated to bring a good message.
4,Good to go,My boy loves it. not sure if he will play it again after he is finished with all the levels but for now he is really in to it
1,Defective profduct,"ok...i bought this game for my nephew who is in another country asking for it specifically for a psp sony. I bought him the psp and the game and a few others. everything else was ok, but my nephew tells me that spider man is defective. So, great rip off for my money...i am never buying from this company again. Now i can't return it ofcourse since it is overseas. Nice con"
1,Not much help,No video and the audio moves too fast even for an experienced guitar. Don't waste your money on this one. I'll give you mine
5,Diagnostic advice mixed with humor,"Click and Clack diagnosed my intermittant start-up problem in about 2 minutes, via this book.As a result, I could talk to my mechanic more intelligently, and I knew what I was in for before I called the shop. I don't fix cars myself, but this book enabled me to be in charge of the process.You get a great diagnostic tool, and some cheesy (but still funny) humor, all for under $15. Not a bad deal."
5,Car Talk 2009 Daily Calendar,"This item arrived promptly, and was in great shape. I would definitely order from this supplier again."
1,The Most Boring Daily Calendar of 2009,"As much as I adore Click & Clack on the radio (I listen to them weekly on NPR), I can't believe how very boring this calendar is. A total waste of money and a bummer of a Christmas gift!"
2,A Disappointing Read,"This book could be half as long as it is if all the failed attempts at being funny were removed. The authors seem more concerned with trying to amuse their readers than with providing them with helpful information. While some good information exists within the book, it's buried among lame attempts at humor. I found myself being annoyed over and over again by these unfunny intrusions.If you're looking for a lot of helpful, well-organized information on car care, I'd look elsewhere (e.g., ""Lucille's Car Care"", by Lucille Treganowan, which I highly recommend). And to the authors I'd say, ""Either be stand up comics or authors of helpful car books, but don't try to be both!"" (because you're failing miserably at it!)"
3,It's okay.,"It works well. You can hear great, and there's no echo. Also I bought a converter cord so that I could plug this into my laptop for gaming....the drawback there, is that after extensive playing, my ear was a little sore. So overall I wish they would have made it more comfortable."
1,The plug has broken on me twice,I was given this headset a while ago and it worked ok for over a year. Then the male plug failed in my phone and both became useless. I bought the same phone and headset again. Guess what? 2 months into using them again the headset jack broke again inside the phone. Do not buy this product. Now I have another useless phone and headset.
1,Must have tiny ear and low expectations,"It's a cheaply made product, can't be adjusted, and not worth wasting money on. And I could barely hear the other party, so I just threw it away and wrote off the 10 bucks -- not even worth taking the time to return. Buy something else if you actually want some function."
2,Very disappointed with this headset,"This headset is a horrible fit for the ear. Item does not stay positioned properly on the ear, and is unable to be used comfortably with small ears. I would try another brand with a different type of ear holder. This one is not acceptable, nor usable for comfort. I would send it back if shipping was more reasonable."
2,Not compatible with Samsung Epic,"The device says that it's compatible with most phones, but the plug is not compatible with the Samsung Epic and does not include an adapter for the plug. Because of the way the plastic is sealed I'm not even able to return to the retail store it was purchased from after opening.Since it's spent money I went ahead and tried on the device; did not feel real comfortable."
4,It works great,"I am on the phone all day running meetings. The meeting attendees use to ask me to speak louder because they couldn't hear me. My old headset didn't work well. So, I researched and purchased Plantronics M220C for the cordless phone. No more complains. Everyone is happy - the meeting attendees can hear from well without me speaking loud. The reason for 4 stars (rather than 5 stars) is the ear piece doesn't fit well and at the end of the day, my ear is in pain."
2,OK and that's it,Poor fit and cannot hear or transmit well. I also purchased the Plantronics MX150 at the same time and glad I did. It is the one for me. Excellent fit and the transmission and receiving is high quality. I guess it still holds true that you get what you pay for.
1,"Nice looking, broke immediately","I thought heard a glitch, an ""open circuit"", a worn-out connection the first time I used it. I wiggled the unit and the problem went away... for one week. It's useless and too cheap to be worth returning. I'm sure the problem is in the factory connections near the plug-in jack."
2,Volume too low,"The volume is way too low. The headset isn't really usable for me because the volume is so low, I can only hear the other person if the room is quiet."
1,Doesn't work,It makes terrible squealing sounds particularly when first connecting. After that you can hear but the sound quality is terrible. And the fit is bad.
2,Plantronics M220C,"I purchased this headset specifically because the complaints about it were that the earpiece was too small. Unfortuntately, the sound was great but the ear piece so large it kept falling off of my ear. I sent it back and ordered the Plantronics MX505 and it is fabulous - great sound and fit."
5,Got more than I hoped for.,"I purchased this headset for home use to free up my hands while I cleaned, cooked, etc. It's absolutely perfect for me. I liked how light and comfortable it was to wear around my ear. The earpiece is actually very flexible, too, making the right fit easy to attain. The mouth piece doesn't smash up against your face as some other head sets I've owned. Callers can hear me loud and clear without any static on the line whatsoever. Granted, you do pick up background noises (although not to loud) so this wouldn't be a good purchase for a business where you'd like to have noise canceling features on your headset. You do have volume control through your handset, so no fiddling with your earpiece trying to find and adjust the volume. For as little as I paid, this was definitely a good buy. I would recommend it for home use."
4,PLANTRONICS EARPHONES,"THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT,IT WORKS WELL WITH MY CORDLESS PHONE AT HOME,THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE WIRE BREAKS AT THE PLUG IN SECTION ,IF THEY COULD GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE SUPPORT AT EACH END IT WOULD BE A PERFECT EARPHONE"
2,Not the best product,I received the headset and used it about 6 different times and every individual on the other end said they could hardly hear me and it sounded like I was in a stadium (echoed). So I said enough and went ahead and returned it.
2,Loose and floppy,"I was expecting this to be similar to my platronics bluetooth that I had for my work phone. This one is much longer, does not have a cushioned earbud, but rather just speaker that sits loosely on your ear. It does have a loop to go around the ear, but that alone does not seem sufficient to keep it secure. Minimal head movement causes the thing to fall off. I am not using it."
2,Returns Department my next stop!,"The cord is much too short. The whole point in having a headset to begin with is to be able to move about my desk while I am talking. This headset is marginal at best. I would agree with a previous reviewer that once I figured out from the minimal directions how to switch the headset earpiece, it was comfortable to wear, but tended to pull out of my ear at the merest movement. I am returning this item!"
1,Poor quality and design,"Aside from the poor sound quality, both sending and receiving, the headset is uncomfortable. I would not recommend it. In fact, I used it for a day and then had to buy something else."
4,great product for the price!,"This is very comfortable to wear on my ear. I can hear on my end very well, and on the other end, they can't even tell that I'm on a earphone. Great product for the price."
5,"Works Great, Avoid Leaving It Out...","This works Great and doesn't hurt my ear at all!! You can work the plastic part that goes around your ear so it is not as stiff and is Very comfortable on your ear. The only draw back is I have a puppy, this evidently smells like me when I take it off, and well, err, uh... well she has eaten two of them!! But A Great head set and evidently tastes good too!! I guess I should be happy, the last puppy I had ate a $250.00 Logitech TV remote. That by the way, was his last meal in this house."
1,Poor Volume,"Sadly, with my phone and it on the highest settings, I can not hear anyone, nor can they hear me. Perhaps my phone is just to quiet for this device. But for me it's useless."
3,Ok but hurts after a while,"This earpiece doesn't work well with the phone I have (A Panasonic DECT 6.0P cordless). The volume is pretty low but the folks can hear me just fine. I'd continue to use it but, like some other reviewers say, it isn't comfortable for long phone calls (an hour, 90 minutes, 2 hours)."
1,Too much static,"I got this to use with my cell phone (Motorola Tracfone). I did not want to mess with batteries in a bluetooth so I opted for a wired earpiece. Tried to use it once. The volume is too low. When the volume is turned up so you can hear it there is too much static. I have not looked for another yet, but will spend a little more next time and get an earpiece that works. It's not even worth the effort to return it."
1,Not the normal Plantronics quality,I own 3 other Plantronics headsets and each of them is great. This model is an inferior product that should not bear the Plantronics name. You would expect a wired headset to be clear and loud. This on is neither. Ironically my other Plantronics units are all wireless and work wonderfully. Look beyond this unfortunate model.
1,Most uncomfortable headset ever,"I don't know how this headset has any positive reviews. It is quite literally the most uncomfortable headset I have ever worn. The plastic piece that wraps behind the ear is so stiff and uneven that it rubs and irritates my ear so bad I can hardly keep the thing on longer than just a couple minutes. There is no soft ear bud type cover for the actual ear piece, just a horrible round hard plastic piece that just hangs next to the ear by the part that wraps uncomfortably behind the ear. It hangs so far from the ear that it's very hard to hear clearly, unless you use your hand to push the thing closer to your ear. Then the horrible design of the round, hard plastic ear piece hurts where it is pressing. Just an absolutely horrible headset design... I highly recommend looking for another style."
5,Mobile Headset review,I have used this headset previously and am pleased with the replacement. Earpiece comfortable and clip on wire moveable. Shipping was fast and item brand new.
2,Broke after 2 days,"I had one before that lasted for about a year until the cord snagged on my fence and it snapped across the top. Ordered this one to replace it. Call quality was fine...not exceptional but better than most. Two days after I got it, the cord caught on a cupboard door and it broke on top in the same spot. It does take some time for the plastic to loosten up and fit my ear. It is quite uncomfortable until it does that. Either way...I'm moving on."
4,stopped looking when i got these,"Prior to getting this one several years ago I had used many others from reputable brands, and they were all disappointing. The primary complaint I had was that the volume seemed attenuated. The secondary complaint with some of them was the need for the head wrap or the loose boom mic or whatnot. After getting this one, I've stopped looking and have gotten a couple more, even for a friend with the same complaints. It's probably not the most comfortable inexpensive set around but it sits firmly on my ear and the volume is the best I've come across; as well for the mic, I've not gotten any volume complaints with people I've talked to. I use the headset a lot for conference calls and whatnot and is a necessity for me to have. Although not a requirement, I do wish it had a true volume control knob and mute switch, which would have made it perfect."
5,The best headset I've found specifically for cordless (not cell) phones!,"I've been through way too many headsets trying to get great sound quality both on my end and for the person on the other end of the phone, and this one takes the prize so far. The model number is similar to but NOT the same as the similar one made for cell phones...but this one truly is optimized for cordless phones and does a great job. The only complaint is that the ear loop on it is less than completely comfortable, but it's a small price to pay for great sound and mobility. I use it with a Panasonic 5.4 GHz cordless phone."
2,Unusable: volume too low and pinches my ear,"On the positive side, the headset is extremely lightweight, and I'm told by people that I've called that the sound quality is very good. Unfortunately, I found the headset unusable for my needs for two reasons. First, the earloop pinches my ear and I can only wear the headset for about 30 minutes before it becomes unbearably painful. Second, I could only use it in very quiet environments because the volume of the earpiece is too low. I would recommend this headset only if you have very small ears and plan to use it in the quietest surroundings."
2,Not recommended for all day,"Sound quality is good, and it's fine for occasional use, but I need a headset that I can wear for hours at a time - this one is just too uncomfortable."
2,Avoid!!,"I recently bought this headset at a chain electronics store. First, a nonessential plastic cover was missing from the box, which only hurts aesthetically (you can see the awfully cheap plastic innards) but doesn't alter functionality. However, it definitely does hurt your ear and has way too low volume. I used to have hours-long calls with an around-the-head 'standard' handsfree but with this one my ears protest.Also be aware that it looks much cheaper and flimsier in real life than in the pictures. Yet, I must admit it's extremely lightweight and has a decent sound quality."
3,OK but I've had better,"This little headset is ok but I've had better. If you don't fit it just right it can be painful after about 20 minutes. Also the there just isn't enough volume control. It only has two settings which is a high and low switch. Even on the high setting, I sometimes need more volume due to my surroundings. I have normal hearing so I know it's not a problem on my end.A final word of caution, this will drain the battery in cellphones/cordless phones at about double the normal rate if you talk alot. For example if your cellphone battery normally lasts 10 hours of talk time, you will only get about 5 hours of talk time with this headset before you must recharge your phone."
4,Plantronics M220C Mobile Headset for Cordless Phones,Good headset for the price. Wish it had voice volume control.Especially like the earpiece that easily fits over the ear.
1,Crap-Ola,"Don't buy this, it's uncomfortable as heck and the call quality is below par. It looks real nice in the picture but that's where it ends. You know the old saying ""form follows function?"", someone should have told it to plantronics. (who usually makes pretty good stuff)"
2,Do not advice to buy,"It's hard to be able to adjust to my ear (normal). The microphome won't stay close enough to my mouth in order for people at the on the other end to hear me. After trying a few times I found out the it helps to use the clip on the cord to attach away from the ear you are using to pull against it.It brings the microphone closer to my mouth.I would buy a bluetooth if I new it would work with my Panosonic cordless phone. Overall, for the price it's okay!"
1,Loose Fit,"Usually I love Plantronics product but this is just ill-fitting. There is no pressure at the earpiece and the whole thing just dangles from your ears. The earpiece actually is just some hard plastic peace - so if there would be pressure this would cause discomfort I asume. Since it was cheap (ok, what do you expect then...) I will maybe not even hassle with shipping it back..."
2,Volume too low and a ton of echo,I have been using this headset for a few months now as well as my officemate. The earpeice is not the most comfortable but is fine for short periods of time.The biggest complaint is that it picks up ALL noises. We have had multiple complaints that we can hear other people talking and even dogs barking in the neighborhood.
2,Not what I expected....,Very floppy..does not fit in the ear canal so it just flops around. The sound was ok but it is just not a secure fit and you can't get it to fit.
2,not what expected,The bud that goes in the ear is a hard plastic and hard to fit into the ear and unless you hold it closer to your ear it is hard to hear out of...although people can hear you clear.
2,Poor Fit,Very poor fit on my ear unable to adjust for my ear. Not enough protrusion for ear bud to be incerted securly in ear.
2,Volume too low!,"Positive: Good looking, comfortable, voice quality is good (natural sounding, no noise)Negative: Mic's volume is too low! People on the otherside always complain my voice is to quiet! (I used it with Uniden 485 cordless phone.) Volume of the speaker (headphone) is quite loud, I have no problem hearing other people's voice."
1,"very uncomfortable, poor volume","I recommend AVOID. This item is poorly designed -- it's very uncomfortable (the ear-hook is odd and stiff, there is no soft cushion against the ear), the volume is poor and can't be adjusted much, and the cord for some odd reason comes out on the inside of the mike boom. (Whose brilliant idea was that?)I can't explain all the great reviews, which induced me to buy this, so I won't even try.Consider the M175 if you want a really nice headset at a reasonable price."
2,Not the greatest,"This product could have been better. It doesn't stay in your ear, and the construction of it all together is just shotty."
3,Didn't work well for xbox 360,"I got sick of xbox 360 microphones breaking, so I decided to buy this to see if it would work.Unfortunately it didn't work that well. I got sound and the microphone worked but I got a lot of feedback and echo. Worst of all it was supposed to block outside sound, but it didn't do this at all.I know that it was designed for xbox so I am not going to give it 1 star. I don't have a home phone so I haven't tried it for that."
3,Plantronics M220C Mobile Headset fo Cordless Phones,"Overall, not a bad headset. The headset itself is very light and sound is pretty good on both ends, though it might be a little on the soft side if you're hard of hearing.It's not the most comfortable headset out there. I've found that how you actually put it on makes a difference in comfort. Instead of just foldiing it over the top of your ear, it goes on easier and is more comfortable if you put the open end of the ear clip to the top of your ear and rotate it into place."
4,Multitasking Made easy.,"Headset cordless phones allows you to enjoy your conversation and frees your hand...Multitasking made easy. You can cook and talk, do house work and talk, even shave and talk!!!Good Voice quality.Only drawback is, the headset hurts the ear in certain positions."
4,Fine for a wired headset,"Still I'm aiming for setting myself free on the next round. Even though I'm stuck in front of this screen most of my day and this wired unit is not bad I'm moving upcountry for the next round.I use three different wired headsets - one double headset for Skype and making recordings, then this one which I change off with a Panasonic traditional style headset. While the Platronics is smaller that the other two my voice doesn't come across to the other end as well as either of my two other headsets.Bottom line is the Platronics is a bit more comfortable, but doesn't perform quite as well. Somewhere between 3.5 - 4 stars."
2,ouch,"I just bought it and am already planning on returning it. Sure it may look nice and even comfortable, but it definitely wasn't comfortable for me. I probably won't even bother listening to the quality now that I hear it sucks up battery power."
3,Quirky and holds your interest,"A middle aged Hollywood film producer finds meaning and connection through coming to the aid of a starlet who's career is over and her life at crisis point. Like Coupland's other works the skill and interest value in this novel lie in the authors observations of the details of early 21st century life and the commercial, over hyped and the past 24 hour history compression, that is US society. The characters are quirky and largely well rendered, but the story meanandered a little too much for me and at times seemed a trifle sentimental. Reminds me somewhat of the dialogue in a Tarrantino film - largely vapid but still amusing."
4,Fast & fun to read,"The only other Coupland book I've read is Microserfs, so I picked this one up just for the heck of it. I'm glad I did, because it was a great read. Coupland's style -- skipping back and forth between present & past & between character viewpoints -- can be a little jarring at first. However, once I got into the book, I found the style to be one of the best parts. It kept me interested and made a relatively simple plot exciting."
3,"Decent read, but no ""Generation X"" or ""Life After God""","Douglas Coupland is my favorite author. I have loved all of his books--until now. The quirky characters in ""Miss Wyoming"" often made me laugh, but the novel as a whole did not bring me through the depths of emotion that his other books have. I don't feel like i'm a better person for having read ""Miss Wyoming."" I realize it's a lot to ask of a writer to change my life, but in the past, it was a challenge that Coupland had no problem meeting."
4,"Great characters, but . . .","I've read most of Coupland's other works and love his quirky characters and settings. The character development is right on track in ""Miss Wyoming"", however the actions of the characters do not always match what we've come to believe is their motivation. I found this frustrating at times. Otherwise, I did find the characters very intriguing. The story of John's mother Doris was particularly well told."
4,Not Microserfs,"Dennis Coupland's Miss Wyoming was not at all what I expected, but it was well worth the wild read. Part social commentary on the cult of celebrity and part gonzo Hollywood buddy book, this is a fun story that has some very poignant moments. From the aging movie producer in recovery to the crazy mom of the former child beauty queen, the characters are well-drawn.The locations lack detail and panache, but the real story here is the people. This book leaves you wanting just a little bit more."
1,Totally Trashy!,"If you are addicted to reading the tabloids then you'll love this book. If you're looking for depth, and intellectual stimulation stay away!"
3,I don't know what to think,"I hated it, then I was indifferent, then I briefly liked it, now I'm indifferent. I think I agree with the other posters who said the characters were not well developed. It's one of those works where you shouldn't think too much; otherwise you'll spoil it for yourself and the author. At the end of the day, if a novel brings me to Amazon to read other reviews, it must deserve at least 3 stars."
3,Mediocre,"Some descriptions were cute and unusual (""his eyes were the pale blue colour of sun-bleached parking tickets"" - p.5), others were just plain ridiculous (""the doctor and nurse inspected his body like it was a skimpy Christmas tree"" - p. 98). Overall the book was ok. Not ""ok good or ok crap"", just ok. I liked the way the storyline skillfully jumped from place to place, without ever confusing the reader. However it read more like a pre-teen novel, its inhabitants caricatures rather than real people. A pleasant read, yet highly forgettable."
4,The Coupland Touch,"The book didn't have the philosophical bite that others do but Coupland excells at, as another reviewer mentions, pointing out absurdities of modern life and the common struggles we have.I heartily recommend this book although as a first Coupland I'd start with Microserfs or Generation X."
3,"Not his best work, but still enjoyable","This book is a pleasant enough way to kill a few hours, even though it drags in places. Not as informative or as entertaining as most of his other books."
2,Would the real Miss Wyoming please stand up?,"Haven't we met before? Coupland's latest work is a depressingly entertaining story, but it's full of character styles, locations, anecdotes and analogies that are getting a little stale. Stale because they have all been used in his other books (can you say ""Peter Mayle""?). Also, Miss Wyoming is organized in a series of flashbacks which can have some effect, but in Miss Wyoming, end up confusing things. I'm not exactly sure why the story was written this way - it's almost as if Coupland dropped his final draft down the stairs and then hastily organized the pages back together. It's time for some fresh stuff, Doug."
4,Wonderfully entertaining; touching characters,"I looked beyond the sometimes self-conscious pop culture references (there are loads) and found two characters drawn with sincerity and tenderness. Anyone who's ever fallen in love, or suddenly felt lost when everything seemed OK, or wanted to totally reinvent themselves, will be able to relate to John and Susan and their journeys."
4,"Same unique style, different scenarios","What I perhaps enjoyed most about ""Miss Wyoming"" was that Coupland tackled new subject matters. No self-absorbed twentysomethings. No plans to save the world. Instead, there were unique characters on their different personal quests. And I love the amazing detailed descriptions only Coupland could devise (John's pale blue eyes are ""the color of sun-faded parking tickets.)"
5,Coupland's best fictional work,"Miss Wyoming is simply a great book. While I enjoyed Microserfs for it's witty and satirical look at life in the mid to late 1990s, but this book has much more depth. Life After God, a super book, shows the depths that Coupland is capable of. Again, he does not abandon the style that brought him this far. Colgate and Johnson (who seems supiciously like Don Simpson, if Simpson had lived and found redemption) are fully drawn and lively characters. You care about what happens to them. Colgate's Jonbenet/Tina Yothers (okay, not a beauty queen) life rings true. Johnson sets out like John Sullivan in Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels. The results of his journey are different, but just as important. The love story and mystery work well. Miss Wyoming works as satire, love story, and social commentary. A terrific read."
3,"Good, but not great","Douglas Coupland is my favorite authors. I eagerly await each new release and snag it at its first availability.""Miss Wyoming"" is a good book. I liked the characters and the discontinuity of time. But it wasn't as strong as his other works. I liked ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" much more.A must-read for a Coupland fan, but not one of his best."
2,Please go back to the suburbs!,"I have to admit, I was very disappointed by this novel. I have read Douglas Coupland's previous books, multiple times, in fact, and I have loved them all.My favorite characteristic of his books has always been the flashes of brilliant insight that he seems to find in the austere desert, a suburban mini-mall, in the woods. The Hollywood backdrop for this story rang hollow, and didn't provide for that same kind of insight.I was also disappointed in the dialogue--usually I find his wording to be charming and intelligent, but here it sounded like the unedited prose of a precocious 10th grader."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I have read all of Douglas Coupland's books and this is the first book that I gave away before I could finish it. I was so anxious to get this book that I pre-ordered it from Amazon before it was available for sale (that should expalain what kind of a Coupland fan I am). I found the story to be unbelievably boring! I usually appreciate Coupland's rambling style, but this time his rambling didn't go anywhere. If this is Coupland's true impression of what society is like now, we're all in trouble."
2,Awful. Douglas Coupland's (Only) Flop,"I've now read severl Coupland novels, and this is the only awful one I've stumbled across. Microsers was great, Girlfriend in a Coma was hard to get through, but once done one could see it's magnificense. Generation X, though cheesy, was fu. Miss Wyoming is completely different from anything else Coupland has written. In a bad way.Save your money. By something else."
2,Not typical Coupland.,"In this novel, Douglas Coupland veers away from what he does best. This work is predicable and mundane. I believe he was trying to take his story telling in another direction- a more mainstream direction, but he fails. The characters are poorly developed, the plot is thin and predictable. Having said this, I remain a huge Coupland fan and if you bored of the formula of Generation X and Microserfs, perhaps this is hte novel for you."
2,"Wow, this is bad","This is my first DC book and probably my last. Using the tired jumping back and forth in time gimmick did not work, I could barely keep track of who was who and where their cliff hanged three chapters ago, was Susan nine or post-crash or is this the present? What a nightmare of a novel. There is the expected assortment of larger-than-life eccentric characters who are unbelievable or do unbelievable things. The worst sin is after all the building and dragging, there is simply no plot!"
4,A Quick Fun Read,"I really enjoyed this latest book by Douglas Coupland. It is fun and funny despite dealing with some rather depressing lives, and reminded me a bit of the best of Tom Robbins. The character of beauty queen Susan Colgate was most interesting, and the one who Coupland spent the most time fleshing out. His look at the whole beauty pagent industry was clearly well researched, and just made my heart ache for the girls treated like living Barbie dolls by their mothers. Unfortunately, the rest of the book felt a bit rushed, as though he just wanted to get it done. I wish he had spent more time with the character's of Vanessa and Ryan, the girl genius and her is-he-or-is-he-not-gay boyfriend. (Maybe in a sequel?) Mostly I was just so glad that this wasn't as dreary and painful to read as Coupland's last book, the dreadful ""Girlfriend in a Coma."""
2,Normally a fan of Coupland,"But this one didn't stick. Microserfs? A-plus. Gen X? That book was rich with character and story telling. Miss Wyoming just doesn't quite do it for me. I actually didn't even notice when this book was written, but i assume after those, but it feels like one of those writers that....I don't want to say has run out of stories to tell, but isn't writing like he loves it anymore. Maybe I'm being harsh because I know he's a great author"
2,Very far-fetched,"Pickard doesn't have a real ""feel"" for the South. Some of the mannerisms and customs she described were laughable. Southerners don't sit around and drink Mint Juleps unless it's the Kentucky Derby. I never heard of an 60's era Underground Railroad for blacks such as she described. If something like that were going on in a small town, everyone would know about it right away.The mystery in the plot was good. Pickard had me guessing as to who the villains in the story were. That's the only good thing about this book."
2,Bof,I read it in a few hours because the storyline was so predictable and I didn't care mot read the details. A real page turner...
1,loses its momentum,this book started off great with a personable character and premise. however it began to get formulaic and with the civil rights story attached to it too messy. it also seemed to me as i was reading that the author was writing it as though she hoped it would be made into a movie. i skipped to the end around chapter 18. she had me until then. three old men as the villains didn't do it for me. it would have been more interesting to treat each story in a separate book: one for the mysterious disappearance and death of her parents and the second for the stalker fan.
4,Short but will make you sweat!,"I bought this Compilation 3 DVD online and found me a rebounder in a mall for $40. I didn't think I need the entire Urban rebounding collection 'coz this DVD already has 4 routines. If I want something short but intense [in my opinion], I'd do Shannon's Interval Bound. My heart rate is up and I'm sweating like crazy at the end. It's easy to follow, easy on my knees and it really works. When my weight wouldn't go down anymore but I know I'm eating properly, I'd go back to rebounding for a week or so and that would break the plateau. I also do Tracy's Kickbound as an add-on to the Speed Interval training from Abs Diet 2 DVD. I use my rebounder all the time if I know the routines I'd do would have some high impact moves [even though the workouts are done by different instructors or from different programs]. I highly recommend this program. I only gave it 4 stars because my DVD has poor quality."
3,Not bad,"If want something new to change up your workout, this is a fun option. Its no tae-bo though. You may need to do a couple diffent workout routines to get a decent workout."
2,Good exercises but poor DVD quality!,"I have purchased many exercise DVDs at the local stores or online. There are times when I notice the DVD quality is bad. Unfortunately this is one of the cases. I hope they improve in the future. Otherwise, the workouts are very nice."
1,no useful,It is nothing but boring video for rebounding.I think i just wasted my time to watch this.Don't buy it.
3,does not look like the picture,"I love that this ring matches my great grandmother's antique garnet bracelet but one drawback is that the metal work, while gorgeous, is two toned. I don't know how to describe it. Halfway through the detailed part of the band it has bright silver work and then it has the silver metal work with a blackened background. I wish that all of the metalwork had the blackened background because it looks more antique that way and it matches my bracelet. In the picture all of the metalwork is the same, if it looked like the picture i would be so happy."
2,I don't recommend this ring.,"Although this ring is gorgeous, and very ornate (for such a small ring). There was one drawback. It turned my finger green. I only wear sterling silver or white gold jewelry, and I have many sterling silver rings, none of those rings have turned my finger green. This lead me to believe that the ring was not sterling silver as it states on the website. I would not recommend buying this ring, or any jewelry from the silver insanity company."
5,Great Mixer at a Great Price!,"My son is 22 months old and wanted a concrete mixer for Christmas. It's very hard to find a decent concrete mixer at a decent price. We love this one! It's really big, great for indoors or outdoors. It has large tires and rolls extremely well. The mixer part is metal and has a handle to turn to make it go around. We felt it was a great buy and is going to be a lot of fun this summer in the sandbox!"
4,Spiderman 3 a good game,"This game is pretty good.It has fun fighting,and the missions are not half bad.But I would say that the graphics are not as good as i would expect.They are OK,but nothing as good as PS3,or 360.Overall you can do many missions.You can fight bad guys,take photos,and you can unlock alot of new moves.You get to go all around Manhattan doing missions.Also this game does not stick to the movies storyline.You get to go and do anything you want to do but some of the missions are related to the movie.Overall this is a good Game"
1,"my spidy sense is tingleing, this game was garbage","This game was bad the story was too short the game got boring quickly, the graphic was ugh, this was a really bad game part1 and2 is way better. I liked part1 the most it was real fun and exiteing, part2 was real great the quality was great the graphic was great and the storymode was great to kinda weird but it was great. I beat all the spiderman games and this was the worst game id ever played, this was just a little upgrade from part2 but this had bad quality and graphic, this game sucked i got ried of it long time ago boring and terrible game."
2,freezing !,"the game plays great when it dosent freeze ,and has to be restarted so i can attemp to play again. getting no where fast with missons cant get to the save point before freezing acures,thout it might be my console but ,issue only happens with this game.thank you anyways."
3,"Good start, then it gets boring","For my son of 4-5 this was a chance to be spiderman. Then after the web slinging got boring for him, I play the game and am slowly getting sick of the long distances you have to travel to find the next objective. You seem to be going from one side of the map to the other all the time.This will be one game that you will play but never finish. That's not to say it's boring. This game will have it's moments, but they are short lived at times.Just because I found it boring after a time doesn't mean it's a bad game. I am at the demand of a small child with a short attention span. He would leave the room and I would play alone. Which defeats the whole reason for getting a Wii in the first place for me which is a father and son time.Older kids will like this game."
3,SPIDER-MAN 3: not the best game ever,"After playing Spider-Man 2, I couldn't wait for Spider-Man 3 to come out. Little did I know I was in for a disapointing game. It was just like Spider-Man 2, but dumbed down a little bit. The freedom of Spidey wasn't as much as it was in the second one. I read some of the other reviews and they say that the graphics are bad. You must have the PS2 version or something. I have the XBox 360 version and the graphics are stellar. I love how they came up with more things with this game. Such as being able to take pictures and stuff. I also liked playing as black-suited spider man. Now, that was fun. I think this game could have done better but was better than most super-hero games."
1,spiderman three the wost spiderman game ever made for the ps2,this is the wost spiderman game ever made for the ps2 it suck so so so bad it made the frist spiderman game look good. in this game you are slow at ever thing and can't fight. the fighting moves sucked and you can't even tie bad guys up. IF YOU WANT A COOL AND FUN SPIDERMAN GAME DO NOT BUY SPIDERMAN THREE IT SUCKS.IF YOU WANT A COOL SPIDERMAN GAME BUY SPIDERMAN TWO.
2,Sucks but not bad...,"Good game. Unfortunately, I've run into some bugs that make the game unplayable at certain stages of the game. If you're looking for the same game play, I'd recommend Ultimate Spiderman or Spiderman 2."
1,This is not a Chinese Holy Bible,This book is a story about FENG SHUI. It is not a Christian Holy Bible.
5,Great Item,I had been searching for a month or so for a classroom inspirational banner that was large enough to matter to my second graders. I found that with this banner. It arrived in a timely manner and it looks great in my classroom.
4,Rachmaninov rendered by a robot?,"This recording was very interesting to listen to. After a few hearings, however, I became suspicious and started also to listen to the audio recordings Rachmaninov made of the same pieces and of the earlier releases of Ampico rolls on LP's (I have these already for 20 years on tape). There are noticeable differences, and the audio recordings do sound more ""human"". Particularly in the Humoresque Op.10 nr.5 I find the sound too robotical. The broken chords in the fast sections Rachmaninov plays more with a ""wigling hand"". Generally Rachmaninov's audio recordings also contain much more improvisation and are nicer too listen too. Anyhow the CD is a very interesting edition of old music coming alive anew. I hope Wayne Stahnke will continue this series. There is still much to be transcribed (Hoffman, Busoni, Rosenthal, Friedheim, Godowski, Paderewski, Chalov to name a few...)"
1,Rachmaninoff Undergoes Surgery,"and during the procedure, the patient died. There is no music here. Digital sound, yes; music, no."
3,Where Does This Take us to?,"Wonderful music most brilliantly played, with no coughings or whatever. Many of them are celebrated pieces too. But I won't for a moment suggest any serious piano music lover to really compare it with Rachmaninov's RCA recordings even if you have the heavy hissings of the latter on the other side of the balance. You will probaly more fun if you could just concentrate on what this technology could achieve."
5,I cannot remove the CD from the cd-player.,To write about this CD serves it absolutely no pupose. One MUST hear the passion that this man expressed in his work. Truely amazing.
5,Digital grand piano reproduction sounds better than life.,"Amazing technology. Rachmaninoff's recorded performances from old 78s etc. are digitally remastered so that they can be re-played on a digital grand piano, resulting in a truer-than-life rendition of EXACTLY how Rachmaninoff sounded in live performance."
5,God Bless Technology!,"This recording is absolutely amazing and crystal clear. I had heard Earl Wild perform the Kreisler/Rachmaninoff, ""Liebesleid"" on Phillips Great Pianists of the Twentieth Century Recordings and was absoluty taken by it. But to hear Rach perform it himself in an acoustically perfect enviroment on a $150,000 dollar piano, blew my mind. The recording was amazing."
5,Rachmaninoff University.,"This album and it's companion is an amazing example of technology used in the service of art. Having heard many other recordings of Rachmaninoff, I have to admit that it was difficult to truly hear through the noise and hiss what was actually going on. Even the piano roll recordings seemed lacking. Upon hearing these albums,I felt it was as if Rachmaninoff had risen Lazarus-like from the grave. Pianists especially should find this bewitching and inspiring. Learn from hearing his perfectly timed trills, the meaning and integration he brings to the left hand, his sense of drama which engages you from the first note, and most of all the sounds- the variety, the nuance, the power. Believe me, if he were playing in front of audiences today, we wouldn't be hearing about the demise of classical piano!"
5,A wonderful way to experience Rachmaninov...,"This CD is a must-have for anyone who loves Rachmaninov, especially for those who are interested in hearing how he played his own music but find the sound quality of recordings made in that time period unacceptable. The pieces performed on A Window in Time were actually recorded by way of piano roll, which Rachmaninov apparently often did. The piano rolls were replayed and recorded on a modern roll-playing piano, so the sound is fabulous. And, of course, Rachmaninov's playing is impecable. I highly reccomend this recording."
3,"too much talking from the author, not enough life of Ms. Robinson","I had looked forward to reading this, after having studied all about Banastre Tarleton, the British Dragoon of such ill-fame. But this book is not nearly the good fun read of the best of the Tarleton bios. I was quite disappointed that the author spent some wasted times panning the excellent bio of Tarleton. Her own book seemed rather boring, and how to make that exciting life of La Peridita boring must have taken some effort. Still, it is a good enough bio for anyone trying to understand that period, and the way women were badly treated."
4,What a woman,"I got this as part of the research I was doing on the era. It was well put together, and full of information of the people, the times and the issues of the day!"
2,"OK, but uncomfortable","This works fine, but I wish I had tried it out in person before (or instead of) buying it:- the way it rides on the ears is uncomfortable - especially if wearing with (sun)glasses- the neck strap rubs against my collar, so if I turn my head, it pushes the thing, rubbing more against my ears- the way it sticks out on either side is a bit goofy looking."
4,sonyfan,"I bought the srf-h11 to replace the sfr-h5 ( which broke due to loose set screw). I used to have a sfr-hmoV( digital model) but did not like all the static and poor reception so I took it backI use it when hiking and found the FM reception to be fantastic at elevation, sound is clear and unit it reasonably comfortable to wear. ( though I take it off during commercials to give my ears a rest). AM performance is very good.The mega bass is about the best I have heard from a sony product.If you climb mountains and like to have music to take along I recommend this unit."
1,not worth the $40,"I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk."
3,just OK,"I wear these to football and hockey games to listen to the game details on the local radio station. For that it is fine.My problem is the way they fit, it is very uncomfortable to wear sunglasses also, which is a problem at the football games.If I were to buy another set, it would not be this type that wrap around the back of your head."
1,Sore ears and goofy looking,I have been using radio headphones for years and I swear the quality and selection gets worse over the years....what was Sony thinking when they developed these things? No padding on the ear holes?.....strap on the back of the head? Forget it if your wearing any type of eye glasses..... Bottom line:uncomfortable...analog tuning(something I thought went out years ago)...stupid strap behind the head...goofy looking... decent reception....don't waste your 40 bucks
1,Old Technology,"I bought this radio to use while I workout. The radio has a cicular dial (not digital) to change the station. While you move, the station slips and will change on you. You need to hold the radio with your hand to listen.Definitly not a good radio for excercising."
4,Sony Sports Radio Walkman,"After a great deal of searching for a wireless AM/FM headset to wear at the gym, I found this to be the best unit available. I would have appreciated knowing that it is quite dated, as the promotional materials enclosed within the packaging had an expiration date of 5 years ago, but apparently nothing better has been developed by Sony since then. The stiff plastic ear grips that hold the headphones in position are not entirely comfortable if you're sweating through several hours of aerobic/cardio work, but they do keep the unit in place."
5,SONY solid quality and great cool design!,I have had this for 2 years. I use it mainly to walk the dog at the park. To catch up on news or just plain good music. Also a necessity for ball games commentaries for baseball and football games. Watch the game and hear the color at the same time. Crytal clear reception and great battery life. I highly recommend this product to improve your lifestyle. So get yours today. Thank you amazon for delivering safe to my door!!
1,Sony Headset,We did not even open the package. This was a gift for my husband and when he saw it he said that it would have to be sent back because he had tried them on before and said that the earpieces are very uncomfortable.
3,Great for Water Walking,I am about to order my fourth Sports Walkman. MY use is unique because I wear this device in the pool during water exersising. The radio is water resistant but over time the moisture does take its toll. However the tunes keep me moving so that I maintain a certain Babe factor at age 57!The one AAA battery is great and lasts a long time. I am not a channel surfer. Keep it on a great dance station to keep me moving in a great indooor pool at the local Y.I will miss this item if it is ever discontinued. In fact that one that I am ordering is a spare!
2,lost sound,"The unit has many positive features, however the signal is easily lost indoors and often outdoors as well. If it were not such a hassele I would return the unit and continue my hunt for one that is better functioning."
5,Sony Sports AM/FM Radio headphones,"lightweight, stays on during strenuous exercise, the analog tuning allows you to easily pick up stations (at the gym or while you're outside). This is the 2nd time I purchased this. The first pair was stolen."
1,Not -- Good,I wished I had not purchased these for my running routine.. They are bulky and weighty. The stations do not lock in at all. Overall I should have shopped around. The ear placement actually hurts and I will not use these any longer.. Wished I could get my money back...
5,Love This Story,"I am sooooooo Happy that they FINALLY put this on kindle! I have ALL of the other books in paperback except this one, because it was out of print.I love Vera and Marcus' story! He was in love with her since he was 18 and she was 28. But the dynamic of their friendship and subsequent relationship is so awesome to me. After all that she endured and his long ago statement that the only woman he would ever marry would be Vera, makes their coming together all the more exciting to me.Since I am such a romantic, finding this story is such an encouragement to me. It also made me pay more attention to the dynamic of me and my best friend. He's a lot like Marcus and me like Vera, but I never paid attention to his actions until after reading this book.Ms. Schuster has definitely made my year with the release of the kindle edition!Happy Reading!"
2,I must have been reading a different book,Let It Be Me was not what I expected it to be. It received great reviews from some of the other readers so I decided to buy it even though I have never read anything by Melanie Schuster. Once I started reading it myself I was not feeling the characters in the book even though the story line was ok.The book moved really slow and it talked more about Marcus's family memember marriages then Marcus and Vera's relationship that's the reason why I gave this book only 2 stars out of 5.
2,An okay read!!!,"I skipped over this book more than once, after reading some of the reviews decided to go with it. It was written very well, with very, very few errors not noticeable, however through the middle I just became uninterested. The going back and forth after he professes his love and she as well to him she continues to second guess the relationship, and this drags on & on...... The fact that it mentions that she believes that she cannot be with child and its mentioned multiple times just affirms that she will in the end huge give away. They have no intimacy to after more than halfway into the reading and it leads you to imagine that when they get together is going to be that kind of love and basketball romance that Stella got her groove back what a disappointment."
3,Loving it,"I enjoyed this one, Marucs was too funny calling the two workers ""Will and Grace"". But Paris was right in her match making this time, and I would love to read about her and Titus, that's the next one I will get. But my favorite is still with Martin and Ceylon, when Donnie and Angelique's story comes out on Kindle I will ge that as well, I have been looking and all I see are the paperback editions but no Kindle editions :(. Ms Schuster, please put them on Kindle."
4,worth the wait,Very enjoyable. Loved the bringing together of Marcus and Vera. their story was very warm and believeable. Can't wait for the next story when they bring Big Bennie other son into the picture.
4,I Like,"This entire series was a great read. I typically find myself a little disappointed when reading sequeled material, but this was not one at all! I love black love:-)))))"
4,Too Real to Be Fiction!!!,"I am 3/4 of the way before finishing this novel and decided to go ahead and write my review on it. This is, overall, a very good read. The beginning was rather slow. The book did not actually pick up until about page 80 when the actual love attraction was revealed by Marcus. I felt several parts could have been omitted in the book. There seems to be quite a number of characters in the book and Arabesque books ususally don't try to cram 50,000,000 characters into one book. That's the major reason why I like to read these little romance novels, because you don't have to play detective to find out who everybody is and who is related to who. Overall, though, the book is very enjoyable. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Schuster's novels. Keep up the good work!!!"
2,Vera & Marcus!!!,"To be honest, Let It Be Me was probably my least favorite book of The Cochran and Deveraux Series that I've read so far. I think the biggest issue I had with this book was Marcus. I really don't like his character very much. He comes off as being a hot head and a jerk at times. I mean, he goes off on his brothers when they are only trying to give him good advice. He orders people around and tells them what they will and will not do like he's their slave owner of something. I guess I wasn't very interested in Vera and Marcus's story anyway. I had to read this book to get to the next because I'm very interested in Angelique and Adonis's story. I've been very pleased with this series up until now. Looking forward to giving a better review on the next story."
2,Not for Epson Artisan Printers,"HP must have changed something about this paper when they redesigned the box recently. I have been using this tri-fold paper in my Epson Artisan 810 printer for 2 years with great success. Now, all of a sudden, this paper will not feed into my printer. I have tried everything possible and no luck. I even ran a side-by-side comparison with the last of my old stock of this paper....the old stock works just fine and the new stock refuses to feed. It makes no difference if I have the ""Thick Paper:"" setting on or off.I am now going to have to find a new paper to print my business brochures because I am certainly now going to throw out a great printer. Very disappointed in this new batch of paper. Returning what is left to Amazon."
5,Tri=fold paper packs from HP,"These came to me very quickly, and I was able to finish these announcements way ahead of time. I already knew what to expect, as I started the job with the same product, just needed more to finish and Amazon's price was only about 60% of my local retailer."
2,BEGINNERS ONLY!,"This product is for people beginning to learn how to play guitar.However, I gave it 2 stars because, if you are a beginner, it might be a good starting point."
2,On the Technical Side,Bastard Out Of Carolina is an intense and important film; however my comment concerns the DVD edition's shortcomings. I own both the DVD and VHS versions of this film and am extremely disappointed that the audio transfer for the DVD is NOT stereo. The tape has a clear stereo mix but the DVD's audio is a shoddy mono track although the packaging states otherwise. The DVD is also presented in a fullscreen rather than widescreen format. For these reasons I cannot recommend the DVD version of this film.
1,Please give me mind-bleach...,"This is a movie I wish I could unwatch. I regret ever watching it, and if I wasn't sick and stuck in bed, I probably wouldn't have been train-wreck drawn into it, praying it would end WELL... but the abuse of this innocent little girl not only still gives me nightmares eleven years later, I still cannot watch a movie with Jenna Malone or Ron Eldard in it. (This was the final straw that I stopped watching Lifetime movies altogether.) Just can't manage it. The level of abuse heaped upon this poor child makes me physically ILL, and that her mother allowed it to go on, and in the end, chose to give the child away to save her life, and STAYED with that monster? No, no, NO... it makes me weep now to think of it, and I haven't seen that movie in over a decade. How can anyone ENJOY watching this?"
4,Interesting but disturbing movie,"Wow! This movie is really intense in parts, some scenes were VERY graphic. Let the viewer beware! This is not a movie for children. It tells the story of a girl who is physically & sexually abused by her stepfather and her mother doesn't protect her. If you like these kind of movies, I would definately recommend this one; the actors are wonderful and the story is very compelling. I did think the pace of the movie was slow in some parts and also some of the characters weren't developed fully enough. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Heartbreaking,"This is one of the saddest films I've ever seen. There are at least three separate parts in the movie where I feel nauseous, angry, and depressed all at the same time. To me, a film that evokes such emotion is worth watching.The acting and the storyline are perfect."
2,packaging,"The information about the movie on the DVD case is written in Korean, which is very disappointing. I do not speak or read Korean! There was no information provided that the DVD case would be in another language. Otherwise the movie fine."
3,Not bad. Just a little intense.,This movie was very sad and it disappoints me to see that happen. But it happens. A girl named Bone gets physicall and emotional abuse from her stepfather. Not recommended for children.
1,Nauseatingly violent.,"Psycho stepfather beats stepdaughter, useless waste of a good soul mother does nothing to stop it. Typcal Lifetime movie garbage. I applaude Mr. Turner for refusing to show it. We know there are people like them in the world and we don't need to be reminded of it everyday, yet LMN gets off on programming this kind of movie. Disgusting, VERY DISTURBING trash, period."
5,This movie,this movie was awesome. not because of its content or what it was about. but because we dont realize how often this does occur. i feel like one out of ever 4 children are sexually or physically or even mentally abused. This movie had really made me think about what kids really go through and each time i think about it the more i feel like i need to become a teacher and tell kids. DONT BE AFRAID!! its not your fault just tell someone!!
5,Unique blend of women's victimization AND women's strength,This emotionally intense but wonderful movie weaves the story of abuse of women alongside women's strength provided by family. I found it unique in this respect. It made me wish I had lots of female relatives living nearby to provide strength and support. The reviewer who gave it one star because the subject matter was filthy should remember that if we don't talk about these issues we will never change them.
4,"Good acting, but sad story","I watched this movie for the first time when I was about in 6th grade. (I know it's not a children's movie).Just like my title says, the acting was good and well-done. Ron Eldard played a convincing abuser, and the depiction of the South was pretty realistic. It just saddens me how stupid Anney was and how she let Bone repeatedly get hurt just because she wanted a husband. I can't believe she even forgave him after the rape. Anney's character was absolutely foolish. This movie goes to show you how abuse become a viscious cycle, because if you notice, there is an indication that Glen was abused by his father. Therefore, Glen sees Bone as a threat because she gets a lot of Anney's attention, and Anney's the only one who loves Glen despite the fact that he can't make anything of himself. It's sad that this actually happens to people all the time."
3,Review,because has no CC! It skips ALOT. and not always want to play even put it other DVD players still wont play at times.
1,If you are fluent in German,"This book would still be a bit difficult to understand as two of my housemates are from Germany, both grad students (1 in linguistics)and they wont even buy it from me!! I am going to try and return it to Amazon, hopefully they will take it back. As it doesn't explicitly say so anywhere - I will say it here... This book is entirely in German!! just the covers and index are in English to fool you into buying it."
4,A must read for open minded voters,"Senator for Sale is a must read in the next two months. I would certainly recommend it to anyone who says/believes that Bob Dole has the ""character issue"" advantage over Bill Clinton! The book shows, with sufficient documentation, the Bob Dole will sell his vote to the highest bidder -- often making people VERY RICH in the process.Did you know that long before the Whitewater people went to court, one of the Doles closest business partners was convicted and did jail time -- for illegal activities directly associated with the Doles? Why hasn't the ""liberal media"" picked up on this?On the down side, Hilton is a lawyer who writes like a college sophomore... not exactly the heights of prose! It also hardly touches on Dole's personal life -- another area where Dole hardly has an advantage on the ""character issue.""Nevertheless, I still recommend Senator of Sale"
3,Failed after 9 months,"I bought this to replace my noisy Yamaha pedal. It took awhile to get used to, but I (was) very happy with it until it started recently making noise and playing less smooth. I isolated the sound to the rocker bearing. After some research, this part seems to be of faulty design and is the limiting factor in an otherwise sturdy pedal. You may want to contact DW to see if they've updated this part since May of '11. The 5 year warranty does not cover 'moving parts', so I guess I now need to buy a $30 replacement part. Not what I was expecting from the 'industry standard'."
5,Buy 1 and your done,"Solid Drum pedal for any genre is virtually indestructible. I play funk, rock, jazz, and hip-hop. I started drumming with my friends' who plays in Heavy Metal and Punk Rock bands, and it's taken ""I don't know how many years of abuse,"" and it beats as swiftly and smoothly as the brand new one I just got a month ago!"
3,Hospital Gown,Was good for my purposes which was as a Mardi Gras costume (escaped nursing home patient with a walker) but the gown was on the small side if I were going to really use it. My back side was all exposed. The gown fit from the front and I was able to ties the ties as tight as they would go but it still left my upper and lower back open.
2,The Gown that could have.,"I was hopeful, looking for something that would be convenient for a low price to be used for my mother at the nursing facility. This is for a very small person and I mean small. I am saving it for either a Halloween costume for a niece or nephew or a cover-up for them when doing an art project."
1,Asesino de la música,Es una recopilación esperable de lo que se puede pensar del cacique de la difunta. Un gran profanador del vallenato. Tristemente un músico sobrevalorado Ideal para regalarselo al peor enemigo
5,Con sentimiento,Diomedez Diaz is one of the best vallenato artist I have heard! My favorate song is *El culpable soy yo* His music brings me back to the days when I was in Colombia and all the parandas (parties). It was one great year of my life. This music is very alive in colombia and I recomend it!
1,NOT SURE YET,"well, I bought one of these and right now I'm havin a ton of trouble with it,,when I hit ""cable"" the screen goes blank,,it won't learn commands,and it won't go to full brightness when I hit cirtan devices,,it also doesn't have a code for my LG dvd player and it won't accept any commands from the original remote,,,I have an older CEMILION and it was much better but I decided to upgrade? the problem is I love the sleekness and design of the newer oneI'LL send this one back and try again,,(good thing is I didn,t get rid of my old one yet),,RADIO SHACK,,,,,STOP SENDIN EVERYTHING OVERSEAS!!!!!!any suggetions anyone[...]"
1,Kamelion 8-in-1,Eats batteries like a fiend. Never could get it to work properly with all my devices. Junk!
1,Never arrived..,"Maybe it is the post office's fault, but I use a PO box only as I cannot have a physical mailbox at my home. I had purchased multiple items at once, Amazon said they would be shipped together. I provided a physical address expecting a large box - but when the items finally shipped and I got Amazon's notification - one box went via UPS and the other via the USPS!!I never got the item they sent via the post office, however Amazon did refund my purchase amount. I probably will stop purchasing from Amazon as I can't give a safe shipping address when I don't know their shipping method!!"
2,American Doll - NOT,I researched on line for American Doll clothing. Ordered what I thought was AD clothing and recieved something from Carpathian? I had to send it to my niece since time b/4 Xmas was too short to return.
4,It Happens,"This is a well written novel abounding in true to life situations that are sometimes serious, sometimes humorous, and always a teaching gem. It's about a woman who marries an up and coming successful businessman. At a critical time in his life he feels God calling him to become a pastor. The wife reluctantly goes along. She truly loves her husband, but she is at odds with the situation. After all she didn't have any call to be a preacher's wife. Her struggle and the husband's reactions are the teaching gems. The plot thickens toward the end with an ending that, unfortunately seldom ends as this one did. A very good read."
2,Not for me,"I can't get through this book. I really hate reading books that are written in the first person. It gives a limited view of the world and of other characters and often leaves you feeling overloaded with one person's baggage, trapped in their ordeal with little perspective on the situation from any other view. I recently have read too many books written in this style. It leaves me drained of spirit and feeling dredged. I'm glad that other people got something out of it but it's just too depressing for me.I love the Mitford books and the Phillip Gulley books because while there are a lot of terrible things that happen there are all sorts of perspectives that make it seem more healthy in the end."
5,Samson took the words right out of my heart . . .,"The author has penned a wonderful story that touches, inspires, and captivates. I found it to be very well written and easy to follow. I didn't want to put it down (""I'll just read one more chapter!""), and I was sorry when I finished it. I have felt so many of the emotions and struggles that Poppy experiences, especially wanting to run from a less-than-satisfactory marriage. But it's all about grace and learning to lean on God during times of adversity. I could really relate to the story of Poppy's spiritual restoration and growth.Samson's prose has a ""Jan Karon-esque"" flavor to it. If you like the ""Mitford"" series, you'll like ""The Church Ladies."" I hope there will be a sequel."
5,Sit down with a coffee and relax!,"When I first began this book, I didn't really think I could finish it. But then as I took my time reading and really think about what the author was writing about, it really shook me. As the plot twisted and turned, my heart went with it and I couldn't put it down. Lisa Samson told it like it is, no sugarcoating for her. I was reading the last chapter on the subway and I was trying not to burst into tears. Pick up your copy today!! and take a few days off to read this book, read it slow, enjoy the writer's metaphors and description, you'll be tranported to Mount Oak."
2,Buyer be aware that this is a DOS program.,"Buyer be aware that this is a DOS program and they should make you aware of what operating system it is, although DOS is on the picture of the program, I missed it."
5,Just as good as the first.....,"The second DVD is full of fun, fantasy and friendship, just like the first. If you have seen the first one and loved it, you are garenteed to love the second one. It's great for the whole family. The on-going adventures of Saga and Sugar will entertain you!"
2,ZZZ!,This cd is mostly a bunch of pointless noodling. If you are already in a deep coma...and you want to stay there...then this is for you! I'm a big Metheny fan...but this is NOT the dynamic Metheny material that most of us love.
3,Not worth the $50 I paid for it!!!!,"The pictures posted on the advertisement for this costume make it seem like a much higher quailty than it really is. The material is a very light see through material, the straps on feet would not stay put, the hood was way too big (and my son has a head in the 90% percentile,) and the ears are freakishly huge more like a kangaroo than a racoon."
4,Good but he's done better,Not bad but he's done better. A whole lot better and i do mean a whole lot better. better better
2,Ink for $5 ??? I knew something was wrong!,"Sounded to good to be true. A $38.00 ink tank for $5.00 well I purchased it, installed it and work great for the first week! Then started to loose color in my printings, finally after 2 weeks cartridge was dried as a bone.Never leave feedback to sellers in the first week - looks like the partial refill and resealed box to make it look new was enough to fool me. Well... you live and you learn now no more ""too good to be true"" New ink offers for certain!"
4,Swings Better Than Most,"Many of the Christmas albums the proclaim themselves swing seem either to include a few swing numbers mixed in with other styles or simply feature mediocre selections; this one lives up to its name and includes many better-than-average tracks. Louis Prima's ""What Will Santa Claus Say . . ."" starts things off on the right track with the real thing and plenty of fun. Satch's ""Cool Yule"" is classic. The ""Jingle Bells"" featured here is the better of the two Glenn Miller versions that float around. Can you go wrong with Ella Fitzgerald? A few of these selections pop up on dozens of compilations (Satcho's, Ella's, and Deano's numbers), but there are some pleasant surprises here, too. In particular, Pete Fountain's ""Medley"" is a delight and swings with the best of them. If you're lookin' to swing this holiday, this is probably the CD to get."
5,Really Fun Holiday Album,"A great collection of upbeat, happy and swingin' tunes from (my guess) mid -to- late forties to fifties. Even if you are a ""modern"" rock&roller, this is definitely a ""hip-o"" record for the holidays. No sad songs here, but Lous Prima swinging with Santa, Louis Armstrong having fun in New Orleans, Kay Starr swinging with the Santa man, etc. It's funny, but all ages of hipsters really dig this album (very rare with everyone's diverse tastes). No joke, buy this one."
1,Broke the first time I used it,I got this product to nip off the pointy ends of 16D nails that were poking through my side of a common fence from my neighbor's property. The product broke on its first use--the bolt holding the cutters together came loose. Would not recommend this for use on 16D nails even though it is advertised as being able to handle them.
4,Primer on Secular Humanism,"This book answers the ""what"" of secular humanism, but not the ""why."" So, if you're looking for a ""debate"" or treatise on why humanism is the better philosophy for humankind, you may not find everything you want in this book. What the book does offer is an explanation of specific humanist ""tenets"" and what implications arise from them. The book covers the definition and history of humanism and then goes into specification application as it pertains to: unity of ""mind"" and body, origins, science, reason, ethics, freedom, happiness and democracy."
3,i im a big fan of you giys,I think the album wide open sapaces .is going to chage the way musick cogracthlashin on your new song reedey to run and i like your buk matt ross san diagol califora
4,Worth reading,Very interesting and well written history of the Chatsworth clan which is still in the headlines these days with the current Duchess being one of the Mitford girls..
2,Title is way too broad,"I finally got around to reading this book, which has been sitting in my basement for years. I was disappointed. It should really be titled: The Footnote In German Historiography. Its scope is limited to the evolution of sourcing in 19th and 20th century European histories.A book should not be titled ""The Footnote"" unless it is going to deal with the footnote's fascinating history in book design, English usage, and scientific and legal literature."
2,Interesting topic - boring book.,"This book was a disappointment to me. The development of the use of footnotes in the study of history is an interesting enough subject. However, the book was tedious to read.There were some bits of wry humor in a few places, but considering the subject, there could have been much more.The author assumes the reader has a very detailed knowledge of the academic pursuit of historical studies and that the reader shares the same love/hate relationship with the footnote as generations of historians have consummated.Perhaps the book reads better in its original German. At any rate, I would pass on this one."
4,One person's journey,"This book was a refreshing look at the environmental devastation happening on earth. It is a book that gives hope and I don't believe is meant to speak on a scientific level about these problems. It is one woman's journey and how she has connected global warming, deforestation etc. with the teachings of Darwin and the importance of oral histories and legends."
3,Step Forward and Step Back,"However, Alanna takes a step back from the subject. The book is written by a journalist - and it feels like it. The book could have been so much more with more soul, feeling, emotion, and conviction dripping from the words. The final chapter makes an attempt at this. I get the feeling that the book was edited so that it would not offend anyone.It doesn't. But this is a book with a subject that should attempt to make some waves. Perhaps, if the reader already has a connection with Darwin or with some of the locations described in the book, there would be more of an impact.For me, I think the book only lightly touched the more important journey. From I can gather, the writer was recently divorced and on a journey to heal herself. The title of the book ""Dancing at the Dead Sea"" described an enchanting inspired moment at the Dead Sea. Later, Alanna dipped into piranha-infested waters to cool down - facing one of her grandest fears and conquering to the melodies of ""pings""."
5,Good little monitor calibrator,"I used this on a desktop monitor and on a laptop. The desktop monitor came with calibration software that I had run through and created a profile for at the time. After the Huey ran through its calibration, and it is quick, the difference was very subtle. However, on the laptop, which was uncalibrated, it made a large difference. Now I know that a picture viewed on either will look the same. I work with a lot of photos and take some myself so it is important to know what it will and should look like."
1,Pantone huey,"Pantone huey MEU101This product did not perform as advertised. Pantone is in the process of replacing this unit with an upgrade which, hopefully will solve the problem. I understand this product is being taken off the market until their situation is resolved. Pantone is being very upfront and responsible in this matter."
5,Good value,Easy installation. Does what it claims. For the best photo printing results you will have to calibrate your printer for the paper you are using. Fortunately that step is free. Go to your paper manufacturers website and download the correct driver for your printer/paper.
5,Huey RATES,"This calibrator was recommended to me at a class, by the instructor, who is a well-known professional photographer. He rated it as among the best, and least expensive. I have used a Spyder in the past, and had multiple problems. The Huey came out of the box, went on my monitor, and it WORKED. It was under $100 and self regulates, updating for the light in the room, regularly and it reminds me to calibrate if I forget. This is the best product I have used in a long time"
3,Works OK with some limitations...,Pros:-It's fairly easy to use-It's fairly easy to setup-Takes the guess work out of tweaking graphics card or monitor controls-CheapCons:-Does NOT work with multiple monitor/extended desktop displays. Pantone tech support says that you maybe able to set the primary display to your 2nd monitor and it may tweak it seperately but it's not supported of the box. Their solution was to buy a more expensive Pantone product-Real time light sensor adjust mode seems to screw up the display after it's calibrated. The contrast became really harsh after I turned it on. I've left it turned off since I don't have any natural sunlight in my office.
5,"A Photographer's ""Must Have!""","I was constantly disappointed by the difference between the colors on my monitor and the output of my printer or commercial printers. After calibrating with the Huey, the colors match perfectly! The setup is quick and easy.If you are at all serious about digital photography, you need to calibrate your monitor. The Pantone Huey is an inexpensive and accurate way to do just that."
3,Good for the money,"It was simple to set up and does calibrate the monitor. I haven't taken my adjusted photos to a lot of places, yet; so, I can't comment on how accurate the calibration actually is.The one gripe I have with it is that it only supports one monitor and they didn't clearly state that in the promotional documentation. I should have really bought the next model up... Eventually, I will have to do that and toss this one."
3,A little disappointed,"It is better than not having it but still leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe it is my monitor or just as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for and it is much less expensive than Pantones other calibration products."
1,"Wanna live in ""The Matrix""?","It's cheap for a reason. I followed the steps, retested, and tried all the options. The end result was the same on all four computers I tried: it gave this wierd green tint, like the Matrix movies, but less subtle - and not at all what I want. Horrible product, and you'll get raped on the return fees..."
4,Pantone Huey Monitor Color Corection,The device was easy to use and set-up was fairly simple. I expecially like the fact that the device continually adjusts the monitor for changes in the light falling on it.
2,THE huey MUST BE COLORBLIND!,"I notice a little difference in what my prints look like compared to my LCD's default settings, so I figured for $80 why not try the huey. Hey it from Pantone and GretagMacBeth and they make quality stuff and have reputible names...I thought. My grey's turned to tan's and prints look awful. I gave it an extra star though because it's cool that it adjust to the lighting in your room. It's still crap though and I wouldnt waste my money if I were you..but hey you monitor might have better results than mine, I'm no expert."
2,"Not accurate and not adjustable, thus not recommended","The huey is easy to use, but doesn't produce adequate results. My screen was far too bright and red, and the huey program simply doesn't offer enough adjustment options to make it work. You can't adjust the gamma level, or really do anything with the brightness, contrast or colors. You are given a selection between 10 presets, with 8 of them being completely unusable, and two of them being semi usable. If you want more options, Pantone expects you to pay 40 dollars to upgrade to the Pro version. This is simply unacceptable. I could not recommended this product to anyone. Buy something else that actually works."
2,Was not satisfied with the results,"Setup and installation was easy. Following the istructions during calibration was straitforward and relatively easy to understand. However, after calibrating several times (8 total) I was not satisfied with the result each time. After my monitor was ""calibrated"" all colors looked washed out, almost like there was too much blue. Also, my monitor appeared too bright for my liking, even with auto-light correction turned off. I'm not satisfied with this product and I am returning it."
4,Good inexpensive monitor profiling,"I use a Nikon D70s, Powerbook 15"" and Apple 23"" display to produce photographs for both print and web display. The Huey has helped me get consistent color actoss displays and various forms of publication. One thing that has definitely improved has been the reaction to the web versions of photographs. I suspect that formerly my photos looked very different on the monitors of others. The Huey has helped me see what others will see and therefore do a much better job of correcting photos. It also let me experiment with color profiling enough so that I suspect I will now move up to a more (expensive) sophisticated device.As to the product itself, it was very easy to install and set up. The device was plug and play and I experienced no problems with the included software. My office has big windows, so the light does change and therefore the Huey's ability to modify the monitor colors automatically has been a big benefit."
2,not work on macbook pro,"when i calibrated my mac book, it's quite okay, but looks a bit blue. i thought coz i'm too stuck in my previous screen color. Went to the system preference, wanna play with the Huey preference. It turned out Huey dosen't WORK in Intel-based MAC....what kind the program doesn't work on Intel-based MAC????"
4,Both extremes - Windows beware!,"Short and sweet: works great, and as-advertised on my Mac from Tiger through Snow Leopard.I just updated my PC to Windows 7 and Huey fails to apply any adjustments at all. Completely incompatible with my graphics card (older ATI Radeon) although it worked fine with Vista. I just finished installing the ""Windows 7 Compatible"" HUEY drivers... didn't change a thing. Maybe you'll have better luck with later graphics cards, but be warned... Microsoft and Pantone are at it again.UPDATE: Bumping my review back up to 4 stars as the problem I was having does not appear to by Pantone's fault. Turns out a lot of graphics-related stuff stopped working with Windows 7. When I disabled the 5-year old Radeon and went back to the Intel on-board graphics, everything, including the Huey, worked as before. Microsoft and ATI apparently don't believe you should keep hardware longer than 5 years."
4,Great for my laptop computer,"Great performance for the money. Purchased this for my laptop so I can edit photos while on the road. Unit folds (in the stand) and the base is designed so that the cord wraps around (in a grove) and the USB plug snaps into the bottom. Calibration was a breeze and it even reminds you to re-calibrate, which is something I am really bad about remembering.Not quite the quality I would want for my main editing workstation but it gets you really close, it is small, and it travels well. The ideal solution for what I needed. For this particular need I can't imagine buying anything else."
2,it is good as long as you get a good one,"I ordered 6 of them and 4 were in very poor quality. Basically, the 2 good ones performed nicely. However, the rest 4 of them are in very bad quality and turn the monitor into dark red, light yellow, or bright red! I think Pantone should improve their overall quality, cause 4 out of 6 is pretty rediculous!"
1,Colours don't match,I bought this wanting to match on screen colours with printed pantone swatches. It doesn't work. The on screen colours are extremely washed out and dull compared to the pantone swatches. I am very disappointed.
1,Disappointed,"I received my huey earlier this week, installed the software, and ran a calibration on my iMac G5 (OS 10.4). The screen turned pinkish. I ran the calibration MANY times and every time got the same result. After a couple of hours, I put everything back in the box and sent it back for a refund."
1,2 strikes - it's out,"I ordered Huey to calibrate my CRT monitor. The original (manufacturer's) monitor profile was pretty accurate, I was mainly interested in Huey's ability to automatically adjust for ambient lighting.Calibration with first unit created strong yellow cast.The replacement unit sent by Pantone created even stronger green cast. I tried it on 2 different displays, under different lighting, same results.Their customer service was trying to be helpful - no complaint there. But I had to return the calibrator. It simply does not work."
1,Failed after one calibration,"I purchased this item in April and used it to calibrate my monitor. It seemed to do a good job. Then the software prompted me to recalibrate after 2 weeks. After running the program to do this recalibration, everything was magenta and my cursor arrow was electric blue-green. I ran the program several more times with same result. I contacted Pantone - they said the item was faulty and that they realized this was a problem with a number of these units and they promised me a replacement unit. They told me the new units would be in by early July. That didn't happen, then they gave a later date of July 21. It is now July 30 with no new units. I can't recommend this unit to anyone. Maybe the new ones will work, if they ever come in."
3,Huey is just OK,"I have tried the Huey and it made two perceptible differences. The screen is now slightly pinker (less green) and more linear near the black point. The images look washed out, lower contrast. I'm not sure I like it or not. I have done many tests on the monitor and I prefer the look I've had with the profiles I generated by hand using Adoba Gamma and other programs. Huey changes the screen when I turn on the lights, as expected. Whether it stays ""the same"" for editing is questionable. What I don't like is that I can't tweak up the color in the profile it produces. So, it's OK I guess. Wouldn't wildly recommend it except for people frustrated with trying their own adjustments."
1,Damages the LCD screen,"The Pantone Huey can leave permanent marks on the LCD screen. It uses rubber suction cups to stick to the LCD screen surface, and when you pull it away it pulls the delicate LCD layers along with it. One of my LCD screens survived this, but another now has an array of bright spots in the upper middle portion of the screen, exactly where the suction cups were attached. Yes, I followed the instructions and used minimal force when handling it. Pantone support didn't bother to return my calls or emails.Never let this product near your LCD!"
3,Just basic calibrator,"This ain't no professional calibrator.Just for amatuers.Price is good, though."
1,Distorts images.,"I have the Pantone Huey and I recently installed it because I purchase a Samsung SynchMaster 2233 for my Mac. I couldn't get the settings just right on the Samsung and I needed something to help me out for all the photos I take. I tried this product and followed all the steps perfectly. I tested it out with a few of my photos like a before and after. The pictures appeared to be darker in many instances almost to the point where you couldn't see them. So pictures also seemed distorted, like certain materials turned out to be blotchy. I didn't like it and returned back to the custom configuration that I figured out. I wouldn't get Pantone. There are better companies out there, or just play with it your self in advance mode."
1,Worthless,Spent an entire evening after installing trying different settings and all produced a picture on the monitor (and same printed on upscale printer from digital camera)that was clearly worse than what I started with so sent back.
1,Toy,"Ive heard good things about Pantone calibration in the past but this misses the mark by far. I thought finally an affordable calibration tool. Well I was wrong. This thing would not stay on my LCD monitor. When I finally did get it to stay and I did a calibration it just didnt seem right. Then the monitor changed on me due to the ambient light adjustment. That feature is a gimmick at best. No way do I want my monitor in constant flux when editing images. If you do buy this , turn that feature off and maybe you can live with this product.Back to the reseller this goes. Anyone have suggestions on an affordable calibration tool?"
3,Pretty good when it works,"I have used a Spyder2Express for several years, but it failed to work at all with Windows 7 on both 32- and 64-bit Home Premium versions. Customer support was not at all helpful. I tried the Pantone Huey and really liked it. However, after a couple of weeks, my display got messed up and I tried it again and it could not correct the display. It said it corrected it, but it did not at all. Thank goodness I ordered it from Amazon and the problem showed up within 30 days!One thing that bothered me also, was that you calibrate your display, presumably so your display will accurately reflect what will be printed, but there are about 8 different user settings that drastically skew the settings away from ""perfect"".I spent several hours pouring over reviews on Amazon and have ordered the Eye One Display 2 and hope that this will be the last calibrator I buy. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLO31M/ref=oss_product"
1,Green Color Cast!!!,"If there's such a thing as ""0"" (zero) rating, that's what I'll give this item. I calibrated my monitor as soon as I received the Huey today and now I have a reeally bad green cast on my monitor! I did some research on the Pantone website and it appears that they have already received reports about this problem. As to why these defective items are still out in the market is beyond me. But what I do know is that I am one dissatisfied customer of Pantone!"
3,Just didn't work for me.,"I looked forward to receiving the Pantone Huey, installing it and using it in my photography. hobby. For whatever reason it did not fulfill my needs and never seems to function as was discussed in the literature.."
3,Died after warrranty expired.,"Worked Ok for about a year. Major nuisance was that I could not get it to save settings, so had to recalibrate more frequent than I would like. After 13 months it just stopped working. I thought Pantone direct retail might give me a break on a new one but all I got was the cold shoulder."
3,Okay but not for the MacBook,I do light photo editing on a Mac Mini or sometimes on a MacBook. On the Mini I use a Samsung LCD monitor and the Huey has worked very well. I got my Huey at Circuit City as a closeout so the price was right. Calibration was simple and quick. Post calibration I no longer have any surprises when printing a photograph. Occasionally I'll edit a photo on the road using the MacBook. Calibrating MacBook's screen doesn't work out so well. Post calibration the MacBook screen has a heavy greenish cast. If you are using a MacBook this is not the Colorimeter to buy otherwise this is a good unit.
1,pass on this one,"Ok, so I had to get a colorimeter and went with this one. I should have spent more money on a better one. This one didn't evenly meter my screen. I actually had to manually recalibrate my screen after using this.Now after installing this program on my computer i get a popup all the time telling me it's time to recalibrate my monitor with the Huey. I don't have a way to turn this off, and I can't open the program up in the controls panel due to ""an error with the program"" So now I'm stuck with this crappy software. Don't get this colorimeter spend the extra money and get a spyder."
2,The Chambers Crossword Dictionary,I was very disappointed. As I use the Chambers Dictionary a lot I expected more from this book. It is just a thesaurus and not a very good one at that.
5,Best shampoo EVER!!!,"Love this product, everyone should try a bottle at least once! Great for all types and lengths of hair I recommend to everyone!!!"
3,Don't feel the difference....,"Honestly, I can't feel the difference. For the higher price, I won't spend this kind of money again on this type of shampoo. Girls might like it but I personally don't feel the difference."
2,Didn't work,"Make sure you buy this at a retailer that allows returns if it doesn't work. I bought one last week after a presentation. It looked and worked great at the presentation. I bought it because I had an immediate weekend-long project where I needed correct color. When I set up my new Eye-one/Display 2, all I could get was a ""fail"" on the emissions test, over and over - and never did get to testing my Mac LCD monitor. No response from the Eye-one ""support"" to my e-mails.I brought the gadget back to the store that then told me I had moved it during the test or the screen had gone black - and that was the only reason it failed. Neither of those were true. ...However, I did get a refund. So, beware. I'd like to give it a 4 or 5 on the basis of what I saw the demo do, but for how the one I bought worked, I'd give it a zero. Had the ""support"" even bothered to respond, I would have tried to work with them rather than doing a return since I really did want it to work. Average the scores for a 2."
5,Easy and Useful,"This little bippy has helped me get colors right for graphic and web design. It creates ICC profiles which can be loaded in on design programs.One bummer: As of July 1, 2007 there doesn't seem to be a Windows Vista 64 bit driver."
2,Short and to the point,"Beyond Appearances is not a good Santana album. It is dominated by synthesizers and drum machines. ""Brotherhood"" and the instrumental ""Touchdown Raiders"" are the only good songs on the album. The rest of the album plays like a soundtrack to a bad `80s movie. Two stars for the two good tracks and Carlos' superb guitar playing. Buy it only to complete your Santana collection."
5,"One man's junk, another man's treasure.","I guess I'd have to give this one 5 stars because the track ""say it again"", which another reviewer said was ""fairly bad"", is probably the one track I have played more than any other in my entire Santana collection."
3,Typical overpriced scholastic textbook,This is a textbook required for a college course. The type (font) is relatively small and the pictures are in black and white. The text is simply written and touches the surface of most subjects affecting education today. The price I purchased this at was at lot more reasonable than sold at college bookstores and the shipping was fast. I had it within a couple of days. The book includes a DVD which I have used in the course.
3,Discover the Hovercraft,"This was informative but limited. More information on how a hovercreft actually operates could have been included. However, this is a ""break the ice"" article which would inform the reader the very basics of hovercraft operation."
2,A rambling tome,"Joel Kovel's book sounds like a college lecture: rambling and with a lot of ""sophisticated"" intellectual words.His eco-socialist program is extremely confused.Apparently, the author believes that a ""Green"" economy is compatible with high tech, using an obscure Christian community known as the Bruderhof as an example. Kovel's criticism of Murray Bookchin is very weak, perhaps because he and Bookchin are so similar?Kovel also calls for a centralized planned economy, while claiming it could be run in a democratic fashion. How come no such system ever existed anywhere in the world? Further, one wonders how the eco-socialist program should be implemented, and by whom? Most people don't want to give up their high standard of living...Frankly, this book was a disappointment."
1,...,"Although I liked the authors' other book, this one was a huge disappointment. The projects were mundane -- and you could come up with much more on your own. After all, just think of the main characters in your favorite Bible stories (e.g., Joseph adn the coat of many colors), and design a boy with a multi-colored coat -- made from polymer clay, quilling, paper, or whatever. I just wasn't remotely impressed with anything in the book, and would have been much happier just using my imagination. This book is going back ... I'd strongly suggest that you save your money, and buy the book about Christian values (which shows much more imagination on the part of the author)."
3,Its too simple,"I thought this book would have a big selection of crafts, but when I got it I was very disappointed. Its very simple and small. Dont have a variety of crafts and only have few pages."
2,out of date but some good info,"This book takes you behind the scenes of TV. It discusses things like commercials, producers, and how shows get started.The only thing is one chapter is on the future of tv. It says imagine that you are in the year 2000. Well 2000 has came and went."
3,Interesting Observations,He lead a great life and found peace in not a house built by man but in the cathedrals of evolution. His poetic understanding of where peace can be found and not just look out your window is extremely thought provoking. A window of peace and tranquility found in the simplest of life that make up Planet Earth.
5,Super high quality videos,"I'm not sure what software/plug-ins are required to play what's on this brilliant CD but for the asking price, I say go for it! The Jimmy Cliff video of I Can See Clearly Now is unbelievably good!"
3,Brief Couples Therapy Homework Planner,"I purchased this book with the Assignment's ""disk"" in August 2008. My computer is new technology and does not accomodate old technology, i.e. a diskette. I contacted the publisher John W. Wiley & Sons Inc., and requested they send a CD-ROM and they report that it has not been updated to CD-ROM as yet. I am appauled that they are selling old technology with their books! I expect to receive the new CD as soon as it is updated. Get with the times, guys. It's the 21st Century!!"
3,Very user friendly,This workbook comes with CD that contains all the handouts for easy printing. Nice to not have to make up your own handouts.
2,Marks on the cover page,"This particular book that i received had marks on the cover! The rest of the book is fine, but still, if I saw this book with marks at a store I would NOT have picked it up. If I can spend the same money to get the same in good condition I would obviously choose that over the one I got.. Overall, I'm unsatisfied with this purchase. I don't think I'll buy another of these since I can't trust the condition it'll come in. At a store, I could've bought the same in excellent condition."
3,Introducing Captain Haddock,"Herge, The Crab with the Golden Claws (Methuen, 1941)And finally, we meet Captain Haddock! (Yes, I'm reading them in order-- for the first time ever.) Of course, he's not the Haddock we come to know and love this early on, but at least he's here. Tintin, Snowy, and the detectives stumble upon an opium-smuggling ring that takes them to Africa aboard the Karaboudjan, Captain Haddock's ship. Haddock is a drunken sot when we meet him, having been supplied with all the liquor he could possibly want by mutinous drug-smuggling crew members, but still shows signs of the bravery and rashness we'd come to associate with him in later volumes of the series. Still not Herge's strongest work, but it's getting better. ***"
3,A must for Herge completists,"You shouldn't leave out The Crab if you're studying the Tintin books, although there are better, more profound stories in the series (I would recommend The Calculus Affair, Destination Moon, and Explorers on the Moon).I would beg to differ with the previous reviewer regarding Captain Haddock's drunkenness. While there is much laughter at Haddock's expense in the Tintin books (he bears the brunt of the numerous pratfalls portrayed in the adventures), he is, in essence, a functional alcoholic, a man with his own vices but also possessing a kind of heroism. The endless physical slapstick in the Tintin books has a cumulative effect and becomes exceedingly hard to take after a while -- it hints at our mortality."
5,The best christmas album for 1998,Vince has a wonderful and unique singing voice and I have enjoyed both this album and Let There be peace album. Breath of Heaven is a brilliant collection of christmas songs from a top Country star. The song are well done and I now consider that it is far better than Mariah Carey's christmas album. Briliant Vince. get this album and his christmas Video.
1,Vince Carries a Baby??,"I have seen Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song) performed in church by a woman with a very lyrical voice, and it was just captivating. Why doesn't Vince have Amy sing that one song??? He is just great on all the other songs but DOES NOT need to be performing this song. Men just don't have babies!! The logic just doesn't fit. For this reason alone I will NOT buy this album...the rest of it is very good."
4,A Breath of Heaven,"Vince IMHO is Americas's premier country baladeer in general, with this compilation of him crooning popular Christmas songs, he rightly joins others (Frank, Nat,Bing etc.) that have also added to all our Christmas's over the years; this album is a must in this category of Christmas standards.For the most part I like the blend of combining the orchestra with Vince's voice, but because I am biased to wanting to hear more Vince, on some songs the Orchestra is a bit overshadowing. I bought six for stocking stuffers :-)"
1,Bunch of crock,"I have been interested in transmission meditation and currently a student. I thought reading about a different form of the same concept would broaden my understanding and awareness. This book is just a bunch of crock and hocus pocus. The author is quite full of himself going so far as to allege that he is overshadowed by the divine. His proof is a photo of himself illuminated at a conference in comparison to the unilluminated present. Hello? Photoshop? I'd rate less than one star if it was an option. There isn't anything illuminating in this text, it's just an ego ranting."
4,excellent overall,"This recording is welcome because it refrains from the usual ultra-romantic performance style which tends to contaminate the Requiem in particular. I like the pure sound (no vibrato) of the chorus and orchestra, and I am very happy with the generally brisk tempi, which I much prefer to the slow, Wagnerian tempi with which the Requiem is usually saddled. I wish the soloists would also sing without vibrato, or at least not so much of it. I find Patrice Michaels' voice uniformly beautiful with impeccable pitch; I do not admire the other soloists as much. I do however recommend the recording, which is well worth the modest price that it is selling for."
2,Not very good,"While the St. Clement Choir does sound beautiful and grandeur, the orchestra and conductor are the weak links to this recording. Randall Swanson's choice of speed is often too fast or too slow, and his handling of the orchestra is terribly weak (there are few mistakes when it comes to keeping the orchestra together). As fot the orchestra, it's not very dull, but it's not very pleasant either. The timpani sounds too corny, the woodwinds are too soft at times, and the brass sometimes loses boldness throughout. The magnificient strings make up for it, though. In conclusion, this doesn't do Mozart's Requiem justice.Go for either Neville MarrinerMozart: Requiem / McNair, Watkinson, Araiza, Lloyd; Marrineror Peter SchreierMozart: Requiem"
3,Needs to be updated,"This book is okay for a general overview of the kinds of vegetarian cuisine offered at Disney World. Unfortunately, since the book was written in 2003 and there have not been any subsequent editions, much of the information is outdated. Some of the restaurants listed no longer exist, and for those that are still around, the menu has changed. I really wish the authors would write an updated edition! For more current menus, you can visit the Disney World site directly (not all restaurants list menus) or you can visit [...] and click on the vegetarian section."
1,"good husband, great marriage","This book was previously published as, ""It's (Mostly) His Fault."" While the title may have changed; the premise has not. Also, when an author makes the disclaimer, ""This is not male-bashing"" as this one has, get ready to be bashed in ways you have not even considered. This is the worst book ever on marriage. The only reason I gave it one star is that 1/4 star was not an option. I am sure he will profit from this book for obvious reasons. If you are serious about improving your marriage, a much better book to read isThe Secrets of Happily Married Men: Eight Ways to Win Your Wife's Heart ForeverReviewed by: Married over 30 years in MD"
1,Fooled,"This book is exceptional.This used booked is so well used that I will not be giving it to my husband to read. It has a TON of notes written in all margins, above the title headings, below the title headings, and on the sides. The notes are specific to the couple who used the book last, it so distracting that a person can't help but read the notes. Well, this detracts from reading and learning. He wife's suggestions, her hightlighting subtitles for him to read is so personal, that I wouldn't have offered this book for sale."
4,Fun toy for babies,"I bought this for my baby when she was about a month old, and she loved it until she was around 5 months - when she started sitting unassisted. She would stare at herself in the mirror and eventually was able to reach and pull down the toys.My only complaint is once she began to reach for the toys and get them down, she would naturally chew on them. The pictures on the hanging toys are stickers and even without teeth my baby would mouth the sticker and would end up with loose pieces in her mouth."
4,Great Interactive Toy/Learning Tool,"My grandson enjoys it very much. He especially likes the mirror feature with the lights. The music isn't to our taste, so we mostly leave it off, but he really likes to kick and pull on the hanging toys. It was a two-month birthday gift, and he is now 11 weeks and uses it every evening."
5,Chair Yoga Program,This is just what I needed to get involve with Yoga. I believe i will be able to do the stand up version soon.
2,At times too quick to follow,"Our seniors group still need to position ourselves right so we can see the video. The moves make you look away a lot.......Anne Pringle is wonderful in this DVD. She is slow and deliberate and explains her moves in very simple terms. My seniors are in their 80s and they found this helpful.HOWEVER, her male partner whizzes through the movements and uses Yoga jargon that my seniors don't understand. They get lost when he is on and also frustrated.In the end, they didn't like the DVD and always want to go back to Anne's Stretch and Strength Chair excercise DVD.This DVD might be more appropriate for a younger crowd."
4,yoga for the rest of us,"If you are beyond sitting on the floor, as I am, and are looking for a calming work-out, stop here: You have found it!"
2,All the trains are in bad moods!,"My 20 month old son can't get enough of this video. However, I was annoyed by the fact that so many of the stories feature characters who are complaining. Also, Alec Baldwin isn't too great as narrator."
4,the new thomas,"Oh, how I remember the day I walked into my local K Mart and seeing this. I so excited and I ended up getting for my sixth birthday way back before the turn of the century. I was disappointed to see George Carlin go, but I thought Alec Baldwin was alright at the time. When I first saw Cranky, I thought it was a freight car on a steel riser! The episodes were good and the new characters were a nice change. This was one of the big changes Thomas went through right before 2000. The new cover was a big attraction to a six year old."
3,A O.K. Thomas video,"I thought that ""Cranky Bugs and Other Thomas stories"" was a pretty good movie and the animation was a lot better than previous Thomas videos. But, there were a few downsides about the movie. One, was the new narrator, Alec Baldwin. I thought that he should have had a larger variety of voices for the engines and that his narrative tecniques weren't as good as George Carlin's or Ringo Starr's. The other was that the story lines weren't that great and it seems that the storys always originated from accidents each time, which isn't all that interesting. Otherwise, I thought it was pretty well done and I think it would be a good Thomas video to add to your collection."
2,Cranky the Crane is Crummy,"My son has enjoyed every Thomas video he has seen, except this one. The Cranky the Crane character makes him cry every time. When he is older, he might appreciate the story line and not cry at Cranky's angry outbursts."
2,"Good overall, but narration poor","We were dissapointed with the narration on this one. Baldwin doesn't have the voice quality, inflection or ability to give each charactor a unique voice. However, the story where Toad goes into a muddy ditch is one of our boys favorites."
4,It dances!,"Wind it up and it dances around my desk. Fun to watch, and it can hold up a reminder note that I need to see later."
3,"Classic Moroder, but doesn't stand the test of time","I absolutely loved this soundtrack when it first came out, but 15 years later I can see its flaws. Much like Mutt Lange today, Giorgio Moroder has an instantly identifiable sound, and since he and partner Pete Bellotte wrote most of the songs the same theme runs through. The only artists on this record able to rise above Moroder's synthesized prison are Billy Squier, with the brilliantly arranged (by himself) ""On Your Own,"" and, surprisingly, Loverboy, whose ""Destruction"" is a nice change of pace. An excellent capsule of who was hot in the rock world circa 1984, but if you're familiar with Moroder's other work you won't find too many surprises here."
1,Sucka$$ mp3 download,Charged $8.99 and download failed. My order shows download complete. This is the first and last MP3 I will ever download from Amazon.com! There is no way for me to download now and I've been ripped off $8.99. Merry freaking Christmas!
2,"Oh dear me, Cheap CD-R from Amazon","Please be aware this is a cheap CD-R, the sound and mastering are fine the music is so so (that's just a taste thing) but the packaging leaves a great deal to be desired. There is NO artist information (this is a various artist CD and I want to know who is performing each song) or ANY details on the recording or mastering. This is bad enough but to top it all off they have the track listing on the back in the wrong order!"
3,Midge Matching,"This book is essentially a pattern book. Little if any information is given about actually fishing midge patterns. In fact, the author spends a great deal of time telling you that he doesn't know much about the process anyway.The real point of the book is that fishing midges requires exact matching of midge patterns to current stream conditions. That is, sample the midge larva in the stream (little attention is payed to dry patterns), examine them microscopically, and tie up a matching fly using the included patterns. Little, if any, entomoligical data is given in the book.The patterns are interesting, though, and the many photos of midges quite good (photography is hobby of the author and an entire chapter is devoted to taking photos of these creatures) although, again, with no entomological data on what is being photographed. Don't look to this book for many tips or ""magic"" solutions that will help you catch fish."
2,Not-so-good guide,"This guide of the Wildlife of Costa Rica is actually a guide not very complete of the birds of the country.As biologist, I've always worked with many field guides, and this one has dissapointed me in many ways. It lacks illustration of photographies of the animals, it does not include any kind of plants (they are part of the wildlife as far as I know), has not any geographical dispersion pattern map in which consult the distribution area of the species, the dimensions are extremly unconfortable (specially considering the light content of the guide), and it's not exhaustive by all means.I'd not recommend to buy this guide to any naturalist interested in a field guide for travelling in Costa Rica."
4,"Good overview, but lacks in details...","This book gives a good introduction into wildlife in Costa Rica, but don't be fooled by the words ""Field Guide"". It is a little bulky and heavz to carry around and if you are interested in a specific species it lacks some details you might be looking for. It does not cover all animals found in Costa Rica by far, but for a country that contains more than 5% of World's biodiversity this might not be expected either. For the general tourist coming to Costa Rica it gives a lot of information for bedtime resume of each day."
3,bit bulky for a field guide,"this guide was a bit bulky for a guide, especially if you are travelling to a place like costa rica to hike around. the pictures were vibrant although i expected them to be more brilliant.its a good guide book for the tourist that isnt exploring the place by foot."
4,"Great, positive music!","I am not a deeply ""religious"" person, but I have been a fan of FFH for a long time because of their positive messages. Great harmonies, catchy melodies, and positive messages make for great, uplifting music that makes your depressing days seem a lot better!"
5,"after Aristotle and Sun Tzu, meet Lu Chi","Well, you know the saying, the pen is mightier than the sword, so I guess Lu Chi is mightier than Sun Tzu. This book was written about 1700 years ago by a Chinese noble.The words are very inspiring and quite beautiful. This is a writer's book, one to own if you are a writer, or one to give as a gift that will be appreciated, if you want to make a writer happy.Here's a sample:""Caught between the unborn and the living, a writer struggles to maintain both depth and surface.""andon rewriting:""Perhaps only a single blossom from the whole bouquet will bloom.""This is a very short book, but one you will revisit."
2,Lu Chi must be rolling with laughter,"Mr. Hamill's translations leaves much to be desired. And completely misses the point by trying so hard to make one.The translation is stentorian and saccharine at the same time. Exactly what Lu Chi wanted author's to avoid.This is great book for wannabe writers who want to strike up conversations at Starbucks. But to serious writers, look elsewhere for cogent advice on craft.My copy is on the way back to Amazon."
3,Literatura española contemporánea,"To whom it may concern: this is one of three copies I received of this book. It was out of print, but I was trying to help my students. It is one of the best anthologies on modern Spanish literature -- I refer to the contents and the inclusion of a ""vocabulary"" to help everyone along. The paper itself is full of acid, so it will not last very long. A shame.I am not referring all three of you from whom I ordered a copy (I needed three copies), but to the one of you who did not send the book, at least not yet. In my rush I failed to take account of the particular invoice related to the book not received. So, while that is my error, I am in fact still short one copy as of 2/7/11. It was promised before the end of January. I wish something could be checked about this, but it is beginning to look like this will have to be ""chalked up to experience."""
5,Tons of knowledge,This books covers wide range of technique and knowledge. Some of them are pretty new to me and probably not on other books. It simply describe the concept/physics and comes with a lot of beautiful color pictures. I consider myself a beginner to midlevel rider. It is fun to read this book even I can not do those tricks/jumps yet. Definetly get this book if you are serious about mountain biking.
5,great info,I found all the information very constructive and useful and the instructions were easy to follow.
4,Great for experienced riders with intermediate skills looking to improve,"I've been riding mountain bikes since 1992 and since I'm also a road rider I made up for lack of technical skills with power and cardio. Now that I'm in my 50's I can't rely on cardio quite so much so I've been learning to ride more efficiently by taking corners faster, braking less, and generally preserving momentum. I find the advice in this book to be a great help and on top of that it's a pretty entertaining read. I'm watching videos on youtube to supplement the material in the book but the book is great for the theory behind what I'm watching."
5,Excellent book and transaction!,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend that I ride with frequently. However, I read it myself before I gave it to him. Great book! Really, really well laid out. Strong empirical look at technique. Fun book. Great transaction from this seller. Early delivery."
5,Is it too late in life???,"I'm going on 53 and got my first mountain bike 1 year ago. After a rude introduction to single track, I decided to try and learn some skills. This book looked like a good source of info, so I ordered it. My first impression was that I'll never risk most of the moves shown by the pros in the book. It's definitely geared toward all-out riding. But I went back to the book and got more selective with the chapters. I then realized that all the basics are there. Not only are the techniques shown, but there's great explanations of why they work. It's almost like having a video. So what first looked like an intimidating how-to manual, now seems more like Pandorra's Box. I look forward to practicing whenever I can spare the time, then getting out and enjoying some terrain. The deer trails above my home have taken on new meaning."
4,Excellent book for technical skills. Style is a bit hard to take.,"This is one of the two best books available for mountain biking instruction (the other is William Nealy's). Excellent sections on technique and generally good explanations of technique. It is aimed at the already competent rider who is looking to improve.It has two minor weaknesses- first that McCormack's fawning style of writing gets a little hard to take (sure, Lopes is an amazing rider, we just don't need to get it rammed down our throats every 3 paragraphs). Secondly, some of the photos are a little hard to follow (e.g. the ones that show leaning into corners are inconsistent with the text). Overall, however, it is an invaluable book.I suggest also looking at Nealy's book. It's less technical than this book, but explains some basic concepts that are left out by Lopes/McCormack and is a lot more lighthearted and fun in its approach while still being crammed full of information."
4,Excellent,A fantastic source of information for anyone wanting to improve their mountain bike riding skills.
4,solid tips for better riding,Great book to get some high level tips. It will definitely help improve your riding for intermediate riders looking to take their skills up a notch. The only criticism is that it was not very detailed on instructions/techniques. Definitely and easy read and worth the money.
4,Comprehensive and concise...,"As a rider starting from the bottom, this book makes it that much easier. Has all the answers you've been searching for in one location. The pictures in the book are useful in visualising the words and concepts, without detracting from the actual information.Very well organised book, and easy to find the information you want. Which comes in handy when you want to refresh your memory on certain aspects.Now its just a matter of hitting the trails and practicing."
3,"Good book, but video would be better","I thought this book was pretty well done, but I find that I can't learn this type of skill very well from reading about it. Video seems to work better for me. Brian Lopes is certainly well qualified and has some great stories in the book."
2,Android Kindle Version,Android Kindle Version problem: Many pictures and diagrams do not zoom which is a really important feature needed on the small smartphone screen. I have Motorola Atrix running Android 2.2. Pretty disapointed about this.What happens is you double click the picture and what you get is Chapter graphic text instead of the picture.
3,Downhill not xc,"This is an excellent book if you are just getting dh or you you just want to improve your cornering. But he also trys to tell you how to climb and eat right during long endurance xc races, and it just doesn't work to have a downhiller trying to teach an xc racer how to climb and eat."
2,Interesting Idea...but not one of Anthony's best,"The idea behind this story is an interesting one, but you can tell this is his first novel. The idea is that a large comet(s) are exploded and diverted in such a way as to bring some additional rain to Earth. The ill conceived plan goes drastically wrong, and the earth is once again deluged with non-stop rain. Cilivization and the environment break down, and Anthony's band of misfits - being led by a man with a vision in a Winnebago - try to survive.If you are a die hard Anthony fan, you should read this to help you understand his evolution as a writer. If not a die hard fan, you may want to avoid this one and try some of his other Sci-fi - like his Orn, Omnivore, and Ox trilogy, or Kirlian Quest Series."
3,Reliable high-concept science fiction,"While the writing might not quite match that of Piers Anthony's more recent works, I like that this book stands alone. Too many science fiction and fantasy works today offer subtitles like ""Book Two Billion of a Multi-Billion Part Saga in Nine Hundred Stages."" If you like high-concept science fiction, then look no further. After rainbows of ice formed around the Earth, they began melting, leaving an unlikely band of people to save themselves and each other. I enjoyed the frequent action sequences, and the growing relationships between the characters. I especially liked how the attitudes toward the transvestite character slowly changed, and how all the survivors learned to work together."
2,Not All What I Expected....,"Well, I asked for it... I assumed our hero from Foyle's War would be similar in all his features..... but as good an actor as he is, I don't think he did himself proud in this movie that should just as well never been made in the first place."
5,First Rate Movie,"If you love BBC mysteries, and Michael Kitchen, you will love this one. Dandelion Dead is a true story which makes it even more intriguing, especially when acted by a very young Michael Kitchen First rate movie and first rate seller. Highly recommended"
1,What is it?,"A word of caution to prospective buyers. This disk is not in the ""field sequential"" format. I have a Sony XBR52HX909 set with the requisite player and glasses and the image produced by the disk is a quivering mess (not in 3d). Significantly the packaging does not display the official 3D logo now used on proper field sequential disks. Exactly what format it may be is unclear - apparently it is not anaglyphic either.In any case I have seen this program in 3D as a TV telecast and truthfully it has very weak content. If the 3D worked it would serve as a demo and not much more."
1,Doesnt work!,"I received it, placed it in my PS3, played it and it doesnt work in any 3D format. Any other 3D media is automatically recognized by my PS3 and PN64E8000 Samsung. It is not like I am running this on some obscure system or outdated software!!! If it only plays on obscure equipment why not say somewhere does not work with traditional 3D equipment??? I dont understand how Amazon lets them do it, the transportation cost they end up paying to take it back is more than the DVD?!?!"
1,Did not work for me!,"I have a brand new Toshiba 3D tv. I can watch Blu Ray 3D, Comcast on demand 3D movies, Side by Side or Top-Bottom with no problems, but this DVD did not work. It looked like a mess on the screen. Too bad because I wanted a copy because Comcast was showing this on their free on demand movie channel and the 3D was amazing. The Movie was not good, but the 3D had scenes where Walter Cronkite seems to pop out of the screen. You do not see many pop outs with todays movies in 3D. I'll keep searching."
3,Adequate Shoulder Rest,"We bought this for our daughter. I think it is fine, although the Kun seems to adjust more easily. We had a Kun on her 1/4 size violin, but when she graduated to 1/2 size, the Kun didn't fit anymore. We could have bought another Kun, but she wanted a red one. I will say that it is a very nice shade of red. Otherwise, I would get the Kun."
5,Finally a practical tool to help marriage work!,"Blissful marriage is a comprehensive book which realistically addresses many facets of the typical marriage. I especially liked the chapter devoted to using questionnares to help in identifying a compatible spouse; I felt the process could be very revealing and useful. Both authors convey their message simply and easily understood which is why this book is so appealing and enjoyable to read. Also helpful were the case studies presented towards the end of the book where both partners of the marriage were given advice in finding a practical solution to many common problems facing marriages today.I would highly recommend this book to people of all ages, either young or mature adults contemplating marriage or married couples sincerely trying to make their marriage a blissful experience!"
3,"Great book, bad kindle edition","Enjoyable read, but the large number of spelling mistakes really put me off. There were plenty of we'11, A s, t hat."
3,You Downloaded This For Free? Consider Yourself Fortunate...(Rating: 5 out of 10- -2.5 stars),"...because paying anything over 10 bucks for this would not be a good idea. If you were fortunate to remember to download this New Years Eve 2007, you would understand why it would be a free download. I didn't do so, and ended up paying for the CD (yeah I know...). The album itself sounds like a demo for Kweli and Madlib. To be honest, it doesn't sound like they show very little cohesiveness on the 9 tracks here. Neither of the two are not at their best. Only a couple of standouts here, which are ""Funny Money"", ""The Function"" featuring Strong Arm Steady, ""Happy Home"" featuring Candice Anderson. ""Soul Music"" is a good vibe that features some uncredited singers. The overall product could have been much better sounding (even the quality sounds cheap). Madlib fans should search for other sources for his production. Kweli fans who are on the fence should just head straight toEardrum. Peace"

2,Good recipes but blase layout,"Part of learning something new is being able to keep your eyes focused on the text. Unfortunately, even with some of the titillating recipes, I found it very hard to follow it. There are no photos, no quick reference at the top of the page to which section I was in (i.e., Kennedy).HE should redo this book with photos to make it a keeper and a classic, like the recipes itself.By the way, meeting Mr. Hanny briefly, I can see why he has bloomed to 300 pounds. With recipes like these, one could sit around and easily gain weight just by looking at the food!"
5,Highly recommend,"My whole family loves this book! Its a great combination of wonderful recipes, mixed with historical snippets about our country's presidents...and to think, you really can eat like royalty! Even my 14yo and 12yo daughters thought it ""rocked""! And that's saying something, from my perspective...."
5,Secrets from the White House Kitchens,"I love this cook book. History comes to life with each recipe. The amazing, rich photographs, using period china and silver, create an authentic mood that puts the White House, as a home reflecting the tastes of its families, into historic perspective. Oh ... and, yum!"
4,Man On The Moon - Collector's Edition Track Listing,"1. Man On The Moon2. Fruity Organ (Non-LP track)3. New Orleans Instrumental #2 (Non-LP track)4. Arms Of Love (Non-LP track)Warner Bros., Germany - 0936240710-2"
5,Pretty Shaker,I was looking for something unique and pretty. This salt shaker looks so good on my kitchen table. I like the handle. But it's all about the design you pick. I would recommend this item!
5,Cute and authentic,"My son loves the fact it actually makes the sound of a woodpecker pecking wood, it makes him laugh and smile."
3,Where are the downy sounds?,"I collect these birds... I am a huge fan! As a bird enthusiast, I really get a kick out of these birdy plushes. The downy woodpecker is one of my favorite birds, but I was sorely disappointed to hear a mere ""tapping"" sound when squeezing this bird. Downies have an awesome quick beat ""chirp"" sound that would have been so much better! When I hear that chirp outside, I know it's a downy. Bummer that this birdy doesn't have the classic downy sound.Otherwise, this plush is cute, well-made and I love the booklet it comes with."
2,The Living End.,"This movie fell short of my expectations. After reading other reviews I was prepared to be thrilled, but frankly, I wasn't. I really was dissapointed because I very much enjoy the directors other films, but this one fell short. Sometimes gay films get decent readings simply because of the homoerotic material. While there are some very powerful scenes in the film, there is a lot of lull time as well. The first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes were the most interesting visually and narrative wise. (...)"
2,Sub-Standard Transfer,"I don't mind watching an almost experimental movie about two doomed HIV+ handsome men who try to come to terms with what's left of life for them, but I DO MIND not being able to see a clear film transfer! I don't know if it's just MY copy (and I doubt this), but my tape looked like the film stuck in the film gate during projection when the transfer was made AND THIS HAPPENED for at least half of the movie! It was so distracting that I could barely keep up with the plot. This was the most amateurish, SUB-STANDARD TRANSFER of a film that I've ever seen. It reminded me of the really OLD days when my super 8 home movies used to stick in the projector when the splices weren't good. WHAT HAPPENED with this otherwise intriguing film????? If it weren't for the transfer, I'd give the film 2 more stars."
2,Just wasn't that impressed,"I could say that this movie shows it's age, but then again, I wasn't really a fan when it first came out. Two HIV Positive men, meet, are drawn to each other, head out on a rampage causing as much distruction as they can. At the time it was controversial due to a rape scene. The movie can lead to some interesting discussions and is probably more fun to watch with some friends than by yourself."
3,gregg araki rules,two gay dudes both hiv positive robbing killing living dying that sums it up and it is WONDERFUL SO WATCH IT AND LOVE IT DAMMIT
3,Very low-budget and a bit out-dated,"It's hard to believe this film is only ten years old, because it seems a bit tame by today's standards, compared to how it was perceived when it was released. The film is shot on an almost non-existent budget, the acting is weak, and the chemistry between the two protagonists is not the strongest. Still, it has its moments, telling the story of two HIV-positive men who have nothing to lose, literally, including their lives. As with most low-budget, independent films, it takes a lot of patience to get through some of the quirks, and perhaps a few viewings to appreciate what is really going on."
1,Video On Demand version is Un-Watchable!,I Cannot hear anything the Characters are saying because there is someone doing very loud commentary over the Video on Demand rental version of this movie!! To say I am disgusted and frustrated is an understatement! Geez!
5,Relive Your Childhodd!!!,"Now you can enjoy this Rankin/Bass classic in the comfort of your own home. Thanks to the private collection of Nick Shaffran, a clean 16mm print was acquired for the making of this Delxuco/Balck Bear Press release. The print was restored and color corrected, leading to a perfect transfer. Not many original prints of this quality exist, which is unfortunate because the original negative suffered water damage due to lack of interest, making preservation impossible. It's been rumored that this near extinction drove a loyal fan in stealing the only working print from the TNT Vaults after being broadcast on ""TNT's Monster Vision"" a few years back. Sound good, then get from Amizon.com!"
3,"Fun for its time, but not quite a classic!","I remember watching this movie years ago when I was a child on a Sunday morning show after Popeye reruns, and thinking this was a great movie. Now the release of the movie left me kind of upset. Granted the animiation of Rankin/Bass is unmatched, the sheer absurdity and somewhat blatent sexist movie of the Francesca, the super-stacked/Little Annie Fannie type robot and Alan Swift/Jimmy Stuart character falling in love in about a blink of an eye! All in all, the movie is fun but very outdated... the younger audience wouldn't enjoy it, but its camp! That's why I bought it!"
3,Should have been more,"I completely agree with Joe brando's review. This is a disappointing release, most especially for the lack of even a mention of Gail Garnett, but also because the featurettes appear as rushed and shoddy things. You have to wonder why they even bothered. If you still own the previous DVD -- keep it. There was a nice booklet with the original release that really makes it overall better than this one. But both versions don't properly offer an anamorphic 16X9 transfer, which they should, and it would be nice if the soundtrack were ""stereo-ized."""
4,Brings back great memories,"How do I start this review?This movie made an impression on me since I was ten years old.Saw it at a school function.Loved the ending so much, I wanted to find this cute movie.I have been searching for over thirty years!Finally found this classic.""Mad Monster Party"" rocks!Creators Rankin and Bass produced this gem.All the characters are well known.Frankenstein, Wolfman, The Mummy, Dracula,Dr Jekell& Mr Hyde, and others,make their appearance in this comedic puppet feature.A synopsis of the story is as follows.Frankenstein has made a new explosive discoverywhile working in his laboratory.He can retire now and lead the life of leisure.Frankenstein calls to all monters to his island to find a replacement for him.From then on, all gloves are off!Which monster will win the position?It becomes a free for all, to say the least.People of all ages will enjoy this colorful DVD.Come join the party, you won't be disappointed."
5,MUST have monster movie!,"Old school stop motion filming meets Universal monsters, you just can't go wrong. I enjoyed watching this film and my kids think it's the cat's meow. You've got great voice talent piled into a fun movie not meant to be an epic just for fun. We have this on our Halloween time movie list right next to all the classics. Good film for kids of all ages. If you like the old Rudolph or Frosty movies you'll love to add this one to your collection. Enjoy!"
5,OH GOD!!!! IT'S GrrrRRRREEAAAAT!!,Mad Balls rock! Need I say more? This movie is SOOOOOO bad that It's GOOD!IT's SOOOOO good that you have to rent it today! OR buy it here! BECAUSE I SAY SO!
3,Better for Boomers,I was highly intrigued by this video & had to have it. I LOVED anything rankin/bass as a child -- how come no one has made a movie about these guys & their animagic shows?!? -- & wanted to share this with my kids who both love spooky stuff. they were bored stiff within the first 10 minutes. Definitely a smart purchase for those born in the 60s & early 70s but not for our kids.
3,It's funny and bizarre...,"I can see why it wasn't a holiday special for children, like Rudolph and Frosty. :) ...a little adult humor in there. But the monsters are funny. :)"
1,very boring,"I hought it would be more like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. It was not, very boring. I wouldn't recommend this:("
5,Mad Monster Party,"I really enjoyed the fact that I was able to share a memorable movie with my kids, as my own mother had shared this classic movie favorite with my sister and myself. Great Condition and addition to any movie collection also arrived right on time as promised Thanks again."
3,Good movie --not quite great,"Despite having ""Frankenstein"" himself (Karloff) to actually provide the voice of the Frankenstein mad scientist this 60's live animation entry still indeed lacks something! But it is indeed enjoyable all the same and a good addition to any horror film fan's DVD collection! One great part comes when a very King Kong-like monster appears on screen and snatches up scientist, monster and other spooks all in a single hand!"
4,Very entertaining but booklet was not included!,"A classic and worth the purchase, but it DOES NOT come with the 24 page booklet, which is a shame. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."
5,CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC,"ahhh the memories. this was a childrens classic somewhat like Rudolph , and Little drummer Boy, with animated puppets. very very funny. featuring puppets of old stars like Phyllis Diller, and Boris Karloff. Old and young will get a kick outta this. And wait till u see Francesca OOOOH LA LA baby (hahaha)"
5,Mad Monster Party,This is a really awesome film to have. This is old school stop motion puppetry from the 60's. I watched this as a kid in the 70's and 80's and now my 7 year old son is now enjoying this movie. A real treat.
2,Mad Monster Party 2 cents,I recall enjoying this as a child but now that I am older I frankly find this film to be bland. The stop motion is pretty static and the music frankly is terrible.I find the music to be unentertaining and lacking any creativity.The monster cameos are nice but that's not enough to really bring in enough reason to sit down and watch this film. Rakin/Bass generally is good but this seems to be a lack luster piece.
3,Not as good as I remember it,"The songs and the plot are so so, but the characters are quite good. Other Rankin and Bass productions were better."
2,"Sorry , But I found it boring.....","Well I bought it because I thought it might be intresting since I really "" LOVE "" Animation......? But for me this was very boring right from the Start......? Even the jokes are lame & sometimes I even noticed the Strings more than once.......? I belive this would be better for KIDS 10 Years old or younger.....? Pherhaps I just watched it on an BAD Day......?"
3,Mad Monster Movie,"I ordered this at my husbands request. He said he watched it on TV as a kid. It is not as good as the other movies made by the same makers( Rudolph the red nose rain deer, Santa Claus is coming to town). It's very slow, the claymation is great but the story line is lacking. I wish it had been better."
4,Mad Monster Party,"Great for claymation fans! However, some children may find it slightly boring because of the singing scenes, not a lot of action. This would depend on the child's ability to follow the story line."
4,"Great Goofy Fun, w/ celebrity voices.","Only my California friends know this one, but if you like the irreverence of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", you'll like this one. Phyllis Diller is hilarious doing her typical schtick as the Bride. This has good camp-following potential. I thought this was no longer available. Thank goodness I was wrong!"
4,Halloween Classic Collection!,"If you enjoyed ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" then this one should be addition to your Halloween collection. ***notice: no subtitle or close-caption for the hearing impaired but great visual effects!"
5,Classic,"I grew up watching this iconic film as a child on local TV in Los Angeles. Purchased this DVD to share with my kids during the Halloween season and truly enjoyed seeing it again. A classic Rankin/Bass production, the same makers of many of the famous Christmas Specials like Rudolph and the Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Clause is Coming to Town, etc.! Wonderful claymations with a funny plot and many funny ""one-liners""."
4,What a party!,"A great claymation film from 1968. Features big names like Phyllis Dillar and Boris Karloff just to name a few. The mad scientist ( Boris ) sends out invitations to his party to all his monster friends to his big bash to announce his successor and his deadly discover that can devolve matter. The movie pics up from there with the antics of the guests trying to second guess each other..... What happens , you have to watch and find out!"
2,Not as good as the Christmas ones,"I was real excited when I saw this for my son. He loves all the Christmas ones so I thought he would really like this one for halloween. Now I know why this isn't on t.v. on a yearly basis. It's quite strange to say the least. My son seemed to like it because he loves Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. So, if he likes it, then I got my monies worth."
2,OUTDATED claymation and dull story,"When Rankin-Bass first came out with their claymation features we really enjoyed them. In fact, we still watch those Christmas specials. HOWEVER...they are cute STORIES, which is why we tolerate the outdated claymation. With this movie you get outdated claymation and a bad story."
2,Not as good as the others,"Hard to stay interested in this movie. Rankin and Bass has so many other great shows, I would not count this as one."
2,Nostalgic weirdness,"From the makers of Rudolph and Frosty comes an animation classic from 1966. The songs are absolutely HORRIBLE, but the movie itself is interesting from a animation-fan point of view. Baron Frankenstien is retiring and wants to put his nephew Felix in charge of all the monsters. They try to kill him many ways because he is a normal human. He is helped by Frankenstiens buxom assistant Francesca to escape. Slow in parts but answers the question, ""why was there never a Halloween special from Rankin/Bass?"""
2,Wish it was better...,"Our family loves Rankin and Bass shows. We were looking forward to this ""lost gem"" and were wondering how did we miss this holiday show? Unfortunately, this movie will disappoint most R&B fans. The movie is not clever and has waaaay too many sham ""hollywood pleasing"" songs that are poorly written. The movie is simply...odd, especially for kids."
2,Fun for a collector...,But that's about it. Thought my kids might like something fun for Halloween. Had read a bit about this but didn't remember seeing it. Now I know why - long and boring.
1,Mad Monster Party Review,"I wanted this dvd bad!! I had not seen this movie since i was 7..maybe 8...and i guess at that age, ANY monster movie was good to me!!! Unfortunately now at the age of 50....this movie was not good...i liked the stopped animation..but the storyline was horrible!!! It sure took me back to a more innocent time in my life, and for that reason alone, i found it charming...but now that it is in my dvd collection, and i have watched it once..it will probably be another 40+ years before i watch it again!!!!"
4,I looked forward to this every year!,"My brother and I watched this every year growing up together. It's one thing even at our ages now, that we still enjoy watching. We were very disappointed when they stopped airing it on T.V. If you like Rudolph and all the other classics, you'll love this."
2,Very disappointing,"I was just amazed how bad this was especially since it is a Rankin Bass movie. I totally disagree about this being a family film...it is not! They have one scene where two women get into a fight but first their clothes are removed down to their underwear before they begin fighting - not to mention that one women's boobs are so big and pointed that they could literally poke an eye out!Bad music, worse dialogue and the story line makes you snooze. The song that Phyllis Diller does is just about the worst I have ever heard.This movie is over 90 minutes long and that would be about 85 minutes too long."
4,"Mad, I tell you!!!","Despite the presence of Harvey Kurtzman and Jack Davis from the original Mad, this picture isn't quite the clay-animated Mad movie one could have hoped for.That said, it is a fine family entertainment as a sidedish to the classic monster films of the 30s. It should be as much a part of one's Hallowe'en tradition as dancing The Monster Mash or getting nauseous on candy borrowed from the kids' baskets!"
3,"Good for collectors, okay for the youngins' for Halloween","Most of the youngins may not appreciate this movie to it's fullest, due to the dated material, and the slower pace of stop animation with clay characters. It could be worth the buy if you're looking for a good more wholesome Halloween type movie that the kids can watch, although don't expect them to sit through the whole 95 minutes without wanting to move on to something else. Even I, who grew up with this stuff, found myself a bit lacking in the attention area with this one.However, as a novice Rankin/Bass movie collector, I definitely feel it was worth it to add this to my collection."
5,"Corny , but Classic Animated Ghoulish Nostalgia","This video ranks 5 stars primarily for nostalgic reasons. If you saw this wacky animated Halloween special on TV any time during your childhood, you will remember the voices of Phyliss Diller and Boris Karloff, the classic monsters, sexy Franceska and the dancing/singing skeleton band in funny Rankin/Bass animated form. You will also remember the corny humor.For those who have never seen or even heard of ""Mad Monster Party"", if you saw Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas you will see, and hopefully appreciate, how very ""Pre-Burtonesque"" this animated feature is.Reviewers can debate the quality of the animation or the sound or any technical imperfections this movie may have (remember folks..it was 1967), but one thing is for sure, it's a cult classic that kids and adults will still enjoy.The DVD image restoration shows improvement but it's too bad the sound wasn't enhanced. The accompanying booklet is also a nice addition to this classic."
5,Taking me back to my childhood...,I purchased Mad Monster Party just before Halloween 2010. How fun it was to see it again. I bought an extra one for my sister and when she received it in the mail she could not stop laughing. We use to impersonate the characters when we were kids. Too fun.
3,not same as picured,"The DVD is as advertised. I was dissppointed it did not contain the extras pictured in the item discription, just the DVD. Did enjoy the DVD though. :)"
1,Don't you want French poet's letters in French as well?,"As usual, the English-speaking American reader is apparently too much of a monophone (let alone Anglophone or, heaven forbid, Francophone) to allow for the original French letters to be included in this abridged and edited publication of Rimbaud from Modern Library. The reader must rely on what appear to be lovely and credible English translations by Wyatt Mason of the French Symbolist poet's letters, but is the reader able to know it for sure? When any reader bothers to read Rimbaud - and no less than his personal letters - the original French text accompanying the English translation should be, ahem, de rigueur [of rigor]. Either wait for a complete French-English presentation of these interesting letters or read right now instead Wallace Fowlie's Rimbaud: Complete Works, Selected Letters that includes the French text facing the English translation."
2,i agree with mr jimjames above,"Definitely read Kneel Down and Lick My Feet. It is short and to the point, and drew me in immediately (you can find it in a short story collection of modern Japanese writers called Monkey Brain Sushi). Unless, of course, you have hours and days to spend lazing on the beach. Not enough to it to keep my interest. Her characters are rather transparent, and though I haven`t read the authors` works in Japanese, she reminds me a bit of Yoshimoto Banana in that they like to bring up big issues but not delve into them. Yamada starts out simply showing us how glamorous Koko`s NYC life is, as if that is the only thing needed to draw us in."
3,This book reminds me of people I met in Japan,This was my first book focused on relationships. I say that this book reminds me of people that I met while living in Japan because the main charactor lacks substance or and desire for self developement. There are many women like this in Tokyo. I was able to finish the book because the author throws in some revelations that kept me interested and hopeful for Koko (what's up with that name??). One thing that I find interesting about the story is that all the black people in it are messed-up.I feel that the book is about the lives of people that live to fulfill their immidiate desires and to that end it is a really good story.
2,Not as good as Kneel Down And Lick My Feet,I was dissapointed after reading her only other translated works
2,translation,"""Trash"" is a great, touching novel, but the translation is not good.I was very disappointed when I read the English version."
3,Kneel Down And Lick My Feet,"I agree with the last reader. ""Kneel Down And Lick My Feet"" is the best of Amy's so far."
4,Excellent Beginner book,I strongly recommend this book for the adult beginner (or child) who is familiar with Raffi's music. Mr. Sun is the first song I officially know on my guitar...LOL And I am proud to strum it for the ever impressed 4 year old in my home! :)I definitely found the music and layout of the book to the benefit of a new guitarist.
3,Not bad as a practice pad,While this unit has some pretty good tones (and some not so good) and a pretty good built in drum machine it's use in a live situation.. not so much. In bypass mode this unit pretty much sucks all of the tone out of my rig (Fender jazz with Ampeg SVT-3 pro head and 4x10 Ampeg cab). A great practice amp with headphones and great scratch pad for creating but pretty much useless live unless you are at the garage band level. I only paid $40 used so it's worth that for sure.
3,"Not a system, rather a list - you'd better already be a coach","I'm a parent of two sons. One naturally runs well, the other very slowly. Well I was hoping to find something similar to other sports training DVDs I've purchased in the past: An organized breakdown of the key concepts or skills required to achieve a certain athletic result, like pitching a baseball. What I found on this DVD instead is simply a comprehensive set of exercises or drills. I don't doubt that they are good drills. Although I found the production value to be much lower than average, that could be overlooked. But because of the lack of some sort of conceptual framework for applying the drills to the complete behavior of running quickly and with agility, for me as a parent, the DVD is already gathering dust after just one viewing."
4,Rhetoric Retold: Retold,"Glenn accomplishes what no other feminist author has ever attempted--she has written a history for rhetoric that includes women. Before we have seen separatist books about women in rhetoric, but never a book that places Sappho on an equal level with Homer. Glenn is the first to reintegrate women into an area of study where they have thus far been denied.Glenn's history of rhetoric is itself a wonderful piece of rhetoric. I recommend this book highly--and not just because she is one of my professors at Penn State."
5,great shoes,great shoes. some of the most comfortable shoes i have ever worn. iv had my pair for about 2 years and they are still good to wear around.
3,They were dry,When we got the cattails they were dry. Followed the directions and now they are getting taller and looking good. No actual cattails but we have hope. All is well
2,"More ""good"" than ""collectible...""","Maybe I missed something, but I thought I purchased a ""collectible"" condition book here for my dad, who loved this title when we owned our own bookstore. The cover was gray and scuffed, the spine had dents, and worst of all, the pages are smelly like mold or mildew. It hit me as soon as I opened the box. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. I've ordered from Abe's and told friends to, this is the first problem I've had."
1,broken - zero stars,"The VHS I received does not work. I contacted the seller, and never heard back from them. Not a satisfied customer."
1,Item Defective,"This item was sold to me as new in the box, but when I received it the box was damaged & the unit never worked on any system I attached it to. I have not been able to contact the shipper for a replacement unit, so I will be looking elswhere for a replacement. This is the very first time something like this has happened with an Amazon order."
3,good but....,very good phone for a small business. however I got this phone because it said it had vm built into it and when I recieved it I found out I have to pay for that service from my provider?!
5,"If you never read another romance novel, read this one.","From the very first words on the page, I was totally engrossed in the story. The descriptions of the characters emotions and the surroundings made me feel as if I were there. It was wonderful to read a romance novel, without having a picture perfect hero and heroine. I loved them all the more for their imperfections. I came to care about the supporting characters as much as I did Jason and Mary. Word by word I moved through their lives. I laughed when they laughed and cried when they cried. A truly wonderful novel. Celeste DeBlasis at her very best."
4,Good band,"I used to shoot marksmen sling shot as a kid. They're fun. Just don't shoot your eye out. And don't aim at other people unless you want to get a beat down.To ensure that the sling shot band retains a long life and doesn't crack up and disintegrate prematurely, coat your slingshot bands with a thin layer of ""silicone grease."" Its also called ""Plumber's Grease."" Find it in any hardware store for a couple of bucks. It's a non-toxic and rubber safe grease that protects rubber. Anything made from petroleum, even vaseline, will eat up rubber.For long term storage of your bands, coat them in silicon grease."
5,perfect replacement,My slingshot bands had dried and cracked since I had last put my slingshot away. This Marksman replacement kit has me back in business. Look out you bad old tin cans! And thanks Amazon. Ya done well. Quick delivery even during the busiest season.
5,So I was like...,"I bought a sling shot locally, but the rubbers it came with snapped shortly after. So, after lots of research and extensive investigation, I've stumbled upon this god given product.What a dream come true, after casually applying saliva to both ends of the stick, I slid that rubber right on, next thing I know I am shooting tricks at high precision targets."
5,great turkey keep away,use to keep wild turkeys and the like oit of our yard. Great to scare off and not harm them. well made and pretty powerful. can get small ricks out several hundred feet
3,sad thing about rubber and hot weather,"Installed it on the sling shot, tested it out, everything OK.Skip one year forward and had a need to use the slingshot. Third shot and one side broke. The rubber had degraded to the point where it disintegrated around both connection points."
3,Easier Said Than Done,"The price is right and the goods are well made. However, at least on the Marksman slingshot I have, the tubing was a bitch to put on no matter how I moistened the slingshot frame. I could not get it as far down as ""instructed"" and my finger is still sore from trying. I suggest you wrap the tubing with cloth and try that. Even less than all the on, though, it seems as if it will still shoot. One other thing, the pouch is narrower than the original, and crowded by the tubing, so I'm not sure how well it will shoot. But there are pigeons to chase, so I'll give it a shot."
2,dont buy it looks very cheap,the pouch is very crusty and hard not good for using with ammo. and the band looks very weak. look for a better replacement band this one sucks. i changed my mind from my other review.
4,Personal Mike,We bought this for members of a non-profit organization to record family histories. Good sound. The small size made people comfortable talking in front of it.
1,Stopped Functioning After a Little Over a Month,"We bought this microphone to use for Skype a little over a month ago. During that time we took a two week vacation, so we had only used it 4 times. We attempted to use it last night and it stopped working. It worked fine up until then, but it's not worth it to replace a $10 microphone every 6 weeks."
2,GE Microphone Review,The microphone portion of this product is flimsy and cheap. (It does not stand upright on its own.
1,Terrible!,"This is a mic that requires ""power"" from your source (computer) that being said, it never worked nor my computer recognized it. I bought because of how cheap it was but as they say ""you get what you pay for,"" returned it."
4,worth it,for the price u pay this item is worth it. people always say they are able to hear me clearly and i don't have to be so close to the mic.
4,works great,I bought this mic for online meetings for an online class. It worked great. The mic tip can be removed.from the base and plugged directly into the mic connection. Recommended item.
2,you will sound like a robot,I bought this mic to be used over skype while playing online games. The audio quality is terrible (you will sound like a robot) and it will pick up all the background noise from your speakers even though it looks like a directional mic. After having this for a couple weeks I got tired of listening to my friends complain about being able to hear an echo of themselves so I bought a headset. Don't buy this for communicating with other people.
3,microphone,"at the very begging it was nice and the sound was loud and clean but after a while it lost its ""power"" and you have to talk very loud"
2,Ugh,"Okay so Ive been searching around looking for a working microphone that goes with my laptop, i saw the positive reviews and though oo maybe something that will actually work...but I was wrong, the stand part wont even work im not sure whats wrong with it, and the portable little microphone, it works but not to my liking or sound quality. I was highly disappointed and as much time (and money) that im wasting, I might as well buy a laptop that has a webcam AND microphone. Thankfully the laptop I have now was a prize because i would never buy a laptop without a microphone/webcam in the first place."
1,"Boom too loosely attached to base, always falls down","I haven't even bothered testing the audio quality of this microphone, because if I did, all I'd really be doing was learning what smacking into my desk sounds like. You see, that's all this microphone does: it falls down. The boom is not attached to the base tightly enough, and/or the detachable mic is too heavy. Either way, it won't stay standing. It just falls over. If it were plugged in, it would fall over and make an amplified thwack sound, instead of a light tap. So, yeah, that's why I don't deem any further testing necessary. I'm returning mine. Thank you, Amazon, for making that so easy."
1,Low Quality,"I had wanted to record my voice and make CDs of myeself and had baught the cheapest mic I could, which was this one. I had made a giant mistake, for when I played the recording of myeself I heard the voice of a three-year-old.To make an honest joke, this microphone is sexist, making the voice of a girl into the voice of a baby as though mocking our natural high-pitched voice.All joking aside, it may not have been sensitive enough to capture your unique voice as your unique voice, but it sure was quick to record background noises such as my breathing.This microphone is enough to make an optimist scream at its low quality.A more expensive microphone would be more expensive, but better worth the money than this one."
1,Instructions,I received no instructions on how to use this mic that I purchased. I check the entire packaging. All I can see is you plug it in and use it. There is no software. So the money spent on this item was useless
4,Good Items but...,It is a good microphone but the bad thing is that you need to be close to the microphone in order for it to be heard. Hope that helps you.
3,For completists only,"These two episodes are definitely the lesser entries of M:I's merely average seventh season. Instead of fun episodes like ""Two Thousand"" and ""Break!"" Paramount instead chose one average and one dismal episode -- ""Puppet"" has a strong cast (including villain Roddy McDowall, and backup scum Val Avery and John Larch) but a fairly slow plot and little visual style or gadgetry. ""The Pendulum"" only has some nice exteriors and sets to recommend it (Dean Stockwell's performance is particularly beneath his talent). Nevertheless, this is probably the only way a Mission completist can buy these episodes on tape, so if you're a collector, pick it up."
4,It gets good,I've read the other reviews for this book. I agree that it starts a bit slow but Ms. Gayle's writing style and the way she creates a world for you to visit is well worth the trip. For anyone who has family issues (and who of us doesn't) there is a lot in this book to relate to. And I guess I'm just a big fan of the authors so I enjoyed seeing how the characters got together in the end. The reason for four stars instead of five is because the beginning is perhaps not up to the stellar openings of her other books but its worth reading on.
2,Thumbs Down!!!,"This book, in my opinion, is not one I would recommend to romance book lovers. The book seemed drawn out right from the beginning. To me, it took a long time to get to the plot of the story. I could not manage to move beyond page 37. The author tries to incorporate pieces of historical fiction into contemporary fiction, which, in my opinion, do not mix well at all. These are two separtes genres that the author is trying to join together and it literally takes away from the novel. I will try other titles by this author but this one just did not do it for me!"
2,Tried to...,"I tried to like this workout. I just couldn't get into it, the instructors were either to over the top or didn't seem all that interested in their class. While I like that the workouts are shorter in length, I just felt it could have also been more intense. I have a busy life so I like quality workouts in the amount of time I have to workout."
5,Good Use Book Supplier From Amazon,Book was as advertised. It was delivered faster than I had expected and that was very good for me. I was kept informed by the seller so I knew the book was enroute to my home. I almost always check with Amazon for rare or out-of-print books which interest me. I have never been disappointed by the service I have received. Ron
4,Non PC,"This is the first in a series of books written by Sax Rohmer and published in 1913. The writing is breathless and compelling - lots of adjectives and action - the ""hanging off the end of a rope at the end of the chapter"" kind of writing. I enjoyed it, if for nothing more than the blatant racism which is SOO non pc and of its era. Dr Fu Manchu is an evil genius, the Yellow Peril, that must be stopped at all costs. He is so much of a caricature that it's like reading a comic really - a hoot. I don't think I'll bother to read any more as I suspect it's more of the same - but it is definitely worth reading, just to remind ourselves of how far (or not) we've come."
2,Not for the unknowing,"If you do not know a lot about being a Polysomnographer, this book will not help you. It is NOT for the lay person. A lot is assumed.Dyane"
3,Death of a Prankster,"""Death of a Prankster"" is the seventh Hamish Macbeth mystery by M. C. Beaton. Andrew Trent, a rich old man, who is a terrible practical joker has called his family to his home telling everyone he is dying. It is a practical joke, but comes to pass as he is murdered. When Hamish Macbeth is told that Mr. Trent has been murdered at his home, he hesitates thinking it is just another practical joke. But Andrew Trent has been murdered. Hamish Macbeth investigates finding several people in his family that wanted him dead. Was he killed for hate, or was he killed for money? This novel is good, but some of the local Scottish flavor that is in the other books is absent in this one, but if you are reading through the series, as I am, it is worth your time."
3,An average book by an extraordinary author.,"This book has a good plot, but the plot is over shadowed by the amount of descriptive detail that hovers around a hippie with pink hair.A good book, but not the greatest. I recommend Death of A Gossip or Death of A Snob."
3,Not one of her best,"In this book we see Hamish called to Arrat House on the demise of the master of the house, Mr. Arthur Trent. Hamish has had a previous run-in with this man because of one of Trent's endless practical jokes, so Hamish is not sure if it's a real murder when he's called or just a prank. It turns out to be real, so Hamish sets out to find a killer. We see the odious Inspector Blair and more of Priscilla in this book. I found the plot a little thin, and it's missing a lot of the unique highland flare that shows up in Ms. Beaton's other books, but well worth a read if you're reading the series as I am."
3,"Not her best , but still enjoyable","Hamish McBeth is called to a strange murder scene. Inveterate practical Joker Andrew Trent has been murdered by a guest in his home. The live in couple already have him laid out with candles on his billiard table. Apparently, the deceased got all of his relatives to visit him by saying that he was dying. After tormenting them with various cruel practical jokes, he is found stabbed to death in one of the guest's rooms. They all hated him enough to kill him, but which one actually did?This wasn't the best of the series. The characters are not very sympathetic and are pretty two dimensional. Hamish and Priscilla's relationship has no real place in the story, and the ending really doesn't resolve much. A quick read, but not up to her usual standards."
2,not hamish at his best,iam an avid fan of the agatha raisin series and hamish macbeth;this novel had no really likeable characters;ok not one of the beat in series.
3,"A good book, but......","This is a good book, but something that reviewer RUBE WADDELL wrote stood out. James's belief that he is the only person that should determine who should and should not be in the Hall of Fame, does stick out and displays itself with a rather ugly glare. I found James to be a little over the top with his brutally candid opinions of players, but I suppose that is what makes the book a good read. The statistics are solid and make for interesting reading. I would have to agree further that James does have political aspirations within the game of baseball. The good thing is that the right people are running the HOF, and James is not amongst them."
4,An excellent manual for new boaters,"I gave this book to a friend who just bought his first boat and he refers to it all the time - uses it for practice too. The pictures and illustrations are very clear - which is the most important part. You never have to ask ""how did that piece go there?"". The key is to practice a handful of knots so you can do them in the dark, or in a storm, when you really need them."
2,Not for Climbers,"The photos in the book are for the most part good. However, it probably tries to cover too many areas. If you're a climber it's missing key knots and hitches-- munter - mule and klemheist for example. Plus, the water knot is just plain wrong. The picture is of a fisherman's knot -- totally different. I've ended up using Luebben's 'Knots for Climbers'. Some of the photos are hard to follow but it includes everything and doesn't appear to have any mistakes."
5,Book of Knots,"This is a great book - has just about everything in it, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow."
2,Got em all this is the best.,I have a bookshelf full of knot books and each of them have something to recommend them but my favorite is Morrow Gide to Knots. It has almost all of the knots in it you would ever want to tie and it is so clearly illustrated and explained it makes learning them easy. Want to learn knots? Take a rope and Morrow and put them in the bathroom.
1,the lost book............,"This was a horrible experience, since I placed this order and did NOT get the book. This was an important purchase, since it was for school and my daughter needed the book for her class in high school. I waited and waited, and even emailed both the seller and amazon but the book never came. I never received a response from either the seller or amazon addressing my problem. I finally had to ask American Express to cancle my charge, since I did not receive the product. I had to place an order from a different source. This was a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE and WORST SERVICE I ever received by a resaler!!!"
1,Waste of money,I was very disappointed in this yoga dvd. It says 30 minutes and it's more like 20. I didn't feel any different after doing any of this. I even tried it with an exercise ball to make it a little more difficult and that didn't help. Save your money and look for a better dvd.
1,For someone injured or a VERY early beginner,This tape is for a very early beginner or someone who is hurt and cannot do actual yoga poses. I am sorry I wasted my money on this. Not for anyone who has done yoga before...
1,Waste of money,"This routine, although composed of useful easy poses, is way too short, about twenty minutes, and yee moves ahead quickly, so the benefit of the stretch is lost. By the time you breathe into the pose, he's already moved on. Do not buy."
3,"I wanted to love this, but it just isn't what I wanted","I want to give it 2.5 stars. I have pretty bad back problems, bulging discs, one surgery and countless epidurals under my belt, and thought that a good back sensitive yoga program would help the essential core strengthening I need to get healthier. BUT even though I've been out of work on disability for a few months due to the fact that I can't sit for more than 3 hours (taking a 10 minute break each half hour) and can't stand for more than 10 minutes. This video was too darn easy. The stretches were nice and relaxing, which was a change from the other beginner yoga dvd's I tried which were too intense for my back. But strength from this one? Not going to happen for me, I'm already flexible enough that doing this program didn't do anything to me at all. Next time I am going to try to rent yoga back care dvds before buying."
