5,Erector set,"This was bought as a gift for my nephew. He blows legos out of the water. This erector set was more challenging for him, which is what I was wanting."
4,not bad,"not bad at all, and congrats to a great band on their way to better things, but i highly recomend their live album - live at the matterhorn over this, infinitly superior. and lets reggae up the next album boys, lose the drum and bass, etc. peace."
2,Generally lukewarm,"I could not agree more with comments made by aortiz. This is generally OK stuff but it never cooks. It never rises to the very high standards that Gato is so capable of meeting, as he did with Que Pasa. I, too, would love to see a duet CD with Gato and Carlos Santana. Carlos's incredible talent is sadly wasted on Supernatural, his latest CD, and it would be wonderful to hear these two great masters together. They are a natural fit."
5,Great. Best of '99 Smooth Jazz,"Gato...hit or miss in my opinion. I love this CD. It's more than smooth. It's slick and very sexy. I have never gotten so into a CD as i was with this. I have the cheesy 70's material from him, and it pales immensely next to this music. I love everything with the exception of the bad version of Auld Lang. It just doesnt fit. I love the song Blue Eyes. It takes me to Argentina, and puts a colorful fruit drink in my hands. It makes me feel like i'm standing under a waterfall. How can any song do that you ask? Listen to this one and find out for yourself. Enjoy it. This disc might be the last one to take you on such a journey...at least from this artist. A-"
3,"Nice, mellow release from the Master","A nice, mellow, tame release from the Master. Those looking for Gato to ""get down"" will be slightly disappointed. Memorable tracks include: ""Seven Servants"", ""Eclipse"", ""Rosa"" and ""Encounter."" ""Auld Lang Syne"" is sure to get airplay as the year draws to a close... - Still waiting for a Gato/Santana duet album."
4,Happy with SVM intro,I wrote my review of this book on the ai forum.You can see my write up there at the link below:[...]I liked the book overall.
4,Fun!,"These were hard to solve, but not impossible. I had a good time with them when solving them alone, or with a friend. And there were still some I couldn't get!"
1,Save your money,Rip off. The leap frog ABC's were great. With this computer generated production they tried to pull a fast one. It is a waste of money.
5,Best Notation Software,"All I can say is ""DITTO"" for the quality of this software program from the reviews I read before buying it. It is more than what I expected. I bought this as an upgrade to Sibelius Student and I think this is the least inexpensive way to get the full Sibelius version. What can I say? I am happy to the max."
2,"It's OK, more of a novelty","The Misfits are one of my favorite bands. Amazing lyrics and intense thrash music, what a perfect blend. In general I think some tribute bands are interesting or even good, so I kind of had high hopes for Ms. Fits. While the band is kickin, the vocals are weak. In all fairness, it's impossible to compete with Glen Danzig... but this singer is pretty bad. With a good lead vocalist, Ms. Fits might be worth checking out. The singing on Hatebreeders and Green Hell is awful to be blunt. I'm not sure if by the end of the CD I get used to it or the vocals improve slightly but the stronger cuts are toward the end of the CD in Angel.... and Astro Zombies. Those are the highlights. The lowpoints are more frequent. It's a shame because the band has the cool factor down- they have Misfit-esque stage names, they have a good look, and like I said the band musically is tight. The vocals pretty much make it a difficult listen for me though."
1,Waste of time,"Just adding a female singer doesn't make doing an album of covers worth while. They may be fun live, but if you're not gonna add your own twist to the songs (sorry, a different gendered vocalist doesn't cut it), why try to repackage and sell an album of songs that were done extremely well the first time??For an example of a really good Misfits cover with a twist, look for Idiot Pilot's version of ""Hybrid Moments"". Their style might not be your cup of tea, but at least they put some effort into making the tune their own."
1,lame Knock off that just knocks off.,"Misfits are an amazing band, Ms. Fits needs to start a real band get some talent and stop mocking the Misfits."
4,Keeps you guessing,"Shroud for a Nightingale is a well-written, well-plotted mystery that will keep you guessing. A young student nurse dies during a training exercise, another is found dead in her bed. The first could have been the result of a practical joke gone bad, the second, a suicide. Or they both could be murder. P.D. James will keep you guessing until the end as to the truth about these deaths and the truth about the nurses, the doctors, the instructors at this very deadly hospital."
3,"Interesting plot, guessed the murderer...","I did like this one, even though it bounced between points of view more than I usually like. The funny thing with this mystery was that I guessed who the murderer was before the book was halfway done. I don't usually guess that (and I don't usually try, liking to just follow the book's revelations), but I knew very quickly who it was. I'm not sure if it means James let it slip early, or if I was just quick to pick up on things. Or if it was a lucky guess.That said, it was an interesting plotline, and a good book. I do think I like her writing more as the series progresses - I can't tell if that means her writing is getting better (I'm going from her earliest books on), or if I'm just getting more used to her style.Am liking it, though, and definitely continuing the series."
1,Oh no!,"I feel so bad for PD James and so horrible for disagreeing with other readers but this novel was sub-par at best. It was incredibly predictable and very poorly written given PD James' talent. I gave it 1 star because I know she is capable of so much better! But as they say, every author has one bad book in them... this means I can enjoy all her others..."
4,Such a Pleasure to Read,"Adam Dalgliesh was called in to investigate the murders (or were they suicide or mischief?) of two student nurses. We follow Adam Dalgliesh through a tunnel of twists and turns as he set his intelligence and determination to crack the case to work. There are enough suspense in the book to keep the heart pumping. DonÂ¡t be in a hurry to flip the pages though, take time to relish at the pleasure of the prose, weaved beautifully into the story."
5,Great Murder,"Typical of P.D. James - another excellent murder mystery featuring one of my favorite sleuths, Adam Dagliesh. The complex plot builds throughour the book leaving one wondering who the villan really is. P.D. James is a master at this type of mystery. Read it and enjoy like all the other novels starring Dagliesh."
4,Very English,Excellent dectective story. The characters are so very English. The saying they use seem so typically English. Good twists and turns.
5,Complicated Murder,"P.D. James writes mysteries for ordinary people. Her characters are relateable and her hero is dynamic. But don't expect cell phones or computers. Her stories are strictly old school, which is what I love about them.The murder is in an atmospheric former home now used as a teaching facility and residence for nurses. The death scene is so well fore shadowed the tension builds until the deed is done. Author James knows how to move a story forward with simplicity and yet keeps the reader guessing until the end.This is a keeper."
4,Another Great Whodunit,"Once again PD James proves why she's one of the reigning queens of the classic mystery novel. They're fiercely intelligent, witty, and intricately plotted,not like so many of today's recent entries which mostly involve serial killers with a vendetta. Here, Dangliesh is called to a hospital where two nurses have been murdered,or was it suicide?"
5,Chilling Read,"I was not able to put ""Shroud for a Nightingale"" down. I have ready many of PD James' books. This one tops my list. Her character portraits are superb and so is the action. The cast of characters are diverse. The setting sinister. I'd call this a must read!"
4,A truley funny book,I loved the book. It was cool how the stories were true. The stories were funny and were all fact. The only thing the book lacked in was how big the book was I wish it had been bigger because I really enjoyed it. I highly recomend it. I know I'll be reading of Brown book's.
4,Classic 40's & 50's,"Four classic war movies with our old time favorite actors.If you like this stuff, it is cheap entertainment for four date-nights!"
3,Not a bad deal.,"Not bad, but get TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: World War II - Battlefront Europe (Kelly's Heroes / Where Eagles Dare / The Dirty Dozen / Battleground) (2009)instead. For the price, it is still a bargain, but I don't think any of the movies are outstanding except for Gunga Din. If you like Gunga Din, get this and consider the other movies as a bonus."
4,Great Bargain !!!,To put in short words. Four entertaining films for the price of one. You wont regret buying them!!!
5,Great glasses,"Avid shooter. Needed ballistic glasses for out door target shooting. These fill the bill.They give clear,color true,no distortion vision. The ear piece is adjustible and they fit well (I am a big guy) Hard to get stuff to fit comfortably. These fill the bill. They are also great driving glasses. Best of all they do not cost a ton of $$$. Amazon as always,delivers."
3,Great movie - but not sure about this version,"I am a fan of Chinese movies. And I own a reasonable collection of Chinese DVDs, mainly purchased in China. Several friends recommended this movie to me, but I was a little disappointed in a couple ways -1. The music seemed out of place for a 'classic' tale. The music seemed too modern and electronic.2. Some of the dialog seemed poorly dubbed, and I am referring to the the Mandarin soundtrack. I am not sure if the 'original' theatrical version was in Cantonese or Mandarin, but Donnie Yen's dialog in Mandarin seemed to be an over-dub of some sort.I will probably buy a different version and make a comparison at a future time."
5,Something really special,"Carl Perkins invited rockabilly music. This luxury cd from Bear Family Records, 31 tracks, include Carl recordings for Sun, Columbia, Decca and Mercury from 1955-1990. Digipack comes with the 46 pages booklet with nice pictures, complete biography and discography and a tribute from Colin Escott.Bear Family Records always knew how to deal with rock'n'roll - sound is AMAZING - perfect mix and mastering.If you don't have a box sets of Carl Perkins, this is the only compilation worth having. This is the real thing from the guy who inspired The Beatles - and he was a damn good guitar player, singer and songwriter."
5,Powerful!,"Perfect for heavy load soldering jobs. Could take a while for it to fully warm up ,but that is expected."
2,Reduced Quality,"I'm giving this a low rating and I won't buy Weller again.The problem is the tiny, vulnerable power cord.It makes this a throw away tool."
5,Does what it should,I bought this to solder connectors & wires for my hobby grade R/C from Traxxas. Takes a little while to heat up but once it does I can easily do a few connectors in a row as the broad tip holds heat well. Worth the money.
3,Good Solder iron for large areas!,"The iron heats fine. The tip is rather large so for smaller solder joints, it is a no-go, but for larger areas, it is ideal."
1,Shoddy quality -- will return for full refund,"I wish I had done more research before buying these head phones on sale for about $50 (which looked like a fantastic markdown from the $150 list price). After about a month, the left ear piece fell off the head band, and simply did not appear to be secured very well. The incident led me to speculate whether the ear piece was intentionally removable for DJ work, but I tend to think the headphones are just defective (and thus, the fantastic markdown!). The noise-canceling features seemed OK. I didn't notice any predominant hiss that other reviewers have mentioned. I intend to return these to the store and get a full refund."
1,Very Disappointed - they're not worth even $20...,"The picture on the box is deceiving: these headphones are quite small and fully sit on your ears. They sit on my ears with too much pressure so I find them uncomfortable. My head is more or less average size :-) so I suspect many will have the same problem.The noise suppression works, but it isn't worth the trouble. As pointed out by another reviewer, there is a very noticeable hiss that is quite annoying. The annoyance of the hiss is worse than the improvement caused by the noise suppression, so I found them to sound better with the noise suppression turned off.That's leaves me with $50 headphones that are uncomfortable and have a now useless battery box attached. Mine will be returned.I have used Bose, and I thought this was too good to be true. It was."
2,"Sound Good, product quality poor","This is a good product if it simply sits in one place - like on a desk. If you intend to travel with it, BEWARE! - The pouch is very compact and you need to literally stuff the headphones in it. The pouch does not provide any protection. Also, within 3 months of purchase the headphone band snapped. The actual ear piece is connected to the band with a ultra thin plastic connector - which will break if you sneeze! Buy this product only if you want a light use product that sits on a desk. Sound quality is good. The noise cancelling feature is OK, I have seen better."
4,Frequent Flier's Best Friend,"These were a Father's Day gift for my husband. He was thrilled to get them - he is a frequent flier and was going to fly the next day. He loves the headphones! These are especially suited for him as he sweats easily and these sit on the ear, not over the ear as most other noise cancelling headphones do. And the price was right!"
3,"Great sounding headphones, but poor mechanical design","Pros: These headphones sound fantastic over a wide frequency range. The noise cancellation is good for the price. They fold up nicely so they're good to travel with.Cons: Mechanical design is very bad. The noise cancellation DSP is housed in an external package that hangs from the headphones, which gets very annoying. The ear cushion comes off very eaisly. Worst of all, the left ear piece snapped off after only about 6 or 7 months of normal use. Very disappointing."
3,"Good price, good sound, middle-of-the-road noise reduction performance","I have been looking for a good pair of noise cancelling earphones to use at my cubicle at work. These have a bright, warm sound, and the sound is good whether or not the noise cancellation is on. In a low noise environment, these might only add noise when switched on. In a higher noise environment, they do reduce noise. They are on-the-ear and seem a bit tight on my head. They are also a little awkward to extend. The battery holder was difficult to open and the switch is also difficult to turn on/off. Comes with gold plated adapters for larger stereo jacks and airplane jacks and a carrying bag."
3,Faulty switch,"These headphones have decent noise-canceling quality. My problem is if I touch the on/off switch enclosure at any time while the headphones are turned on, it sounds like I am rubbing my finger over a microphone. It's really loud and disturbing, especially once you're used to the quiet the headphones have created. It's not hard to accidentally touch the enclosure either, so it's not an infrequent occurrence. I thought the microphone was in the headphones, too, not the wired switch enclosure. I am going to return these to see if they are defective."
2,Book review,"The book was not what I was looking for. I was looking for a book to help me design and duild a simple low power transmitter. The book had a realy good section on Oscillators circuets and what type of oscillator works best for what type of application. Other then that, the rest of the book was pre-cand Low Power Tranmitters circuet designs, to build. Don't take this as bad. It just did not work for me. The transmitter circuet designs look good, just did not fit my aplication.The book was well ritten and easy to read.If you are looking to design and build a simple low power AM transmitter, I have found ""Basic Radio: Understanding the Key Building Blocks"" is a good place to start."
3,Nice book BUT...,"Great information in the book, but some of the items to build the projects are hard to get. I need to say two more words to Submit....ha ha"
4,Takes me back to the old daze!!,"I used to go and see Twisted ... Sister back in the day at ""Speaks"" in Island park...still one of the best live acts that I have ever seen! Twisted was so raw and powerful (and don't forget LOUD!), I still remember being at their shows...the audience would go absolutely wild for them. They were without a doubt THE best club/bar band of the late 70's early 80's. I wish I could go back and see them at ""Speaks"", but I can't, so this CD is the closest that I can come....and it really hits the mark. I feel like im back at the club when I put this record on...the sound quality isnt that great, but it is powerful and energetic like an old school Twisted show. So for all you S.M.F's, pick up this record...you wont be disappointed. And by the way, the first 2 tracks are new releases and they are excellent! So buy this CD and PLAY IT LOUD MUTHA!"
4,Live CD looks pretty good,"I downloaded the live CD and ran it on three different machines, all with good results. The defaults in Santa Fe Linux makes for an attractive desktop and most of the applications appear to be quite good and useful. However, unlike SimplyMEPIS the live CD is just that and it does not have an installation routine -- you have to purchase the full version. I was sufficiently impressed by what I saw that I am entertaining spending the money. That event is contingent upon the answers to a couple of questions that I have posed to Santa Fe Software about SMP for my dual-Athlon rig. Overall, this distribution looks promising to me, a Linux user for better than ten years."
3,Something is wrong with last review,"I was just on the site and you can download a Live CD, But I understand it cant install. So how were or why were you trying?Now if you like you can go to the site yourself and read the forums. Dont buy Mandrake. It isnt even close to this Buy Lycoris LX or SuSE personal edition.. They are a desktop linux distroAfter what this man posted I have to wonder about his motivesCheck the site yourself http://www.santafelinux.com/"
5,Best Scarf pattern book!!,"I am selling scarves so I am always in search of pattern ideas. With most books I find that either the patterns are too basic (or just plain ugly) or they are too advanced for my level. This book has a good balance of neat, unique patterns that are easily made by a beginner to moderate knitter."
5,Recommended,I rather buy a corded trimmer. Its better is not like the others that you have to charge and dont last anything. But this is a great product. I'm planning to buy a second one.
1,"Bulky, loud and difficult to use","Wahl usually makes good products, but I would not recommend this one. The trimmer is very big (about the width of a baseball in your hand) and difficult to use because of its size (hard to see where you're trimming). It is also very loud from the ""vacuum"". I would recommend getting a beard/mustache trimmer that's smaller and easier to use. Mine has been sitting in the bathroom cabinet and I haven't used it in months. I will be buying a different beard trimmer soon."
5,Love These,Nice feel against my skin. No Panty Lines whatsoever!!! It is a little early to report on the durability but thay are holding up to machine washing without any problems yet. i have owned these for approx. 2 moths
4,Very pleased!,"The pot rack arrived quickly and exactly like it was described. I also picked up some extra hooks because I knew I would need more than the ones that came with it.The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish it had come with the hanging hardware, and instructions for hanging. I'm a new homeowner and have to learn things as I go, so it was frustrating to try to figure out the best way to hang the pot rack without it falling on my head while I'm cooking.In the end, though, after I had gotten it up, it looks great in my kitchen and displays my prized pots and pans perfectly. I think it would go well with any decor, because it's not too frilly or fancy, but at the same time it's so well made that it looks classy."
4,Historical Writing,"What you have to understand, and what some of the previous reviews fail to understand is that this is a piece of writing from 1644. Matthew Hopkins was a witch-finder. It's not filled with poor grammar. It's written in Old English. I'm using it for a grad paper on the fallacy of gender biases in witch hunting. It's a good resource giving a view of the Early Modern European thought processes of witch-finders. It's not a good resource for understanding what a witch is considered today or for understanding modern Wicca."
2,"A great find, but could use some more info.","I was amazed to find a book by the monster Hopkins on Amazon, and quite excited. It probably should have a preface containing, at least, when it was written and what Matthew Hopkins did, because knowing that heightens the impact of the book."
2,Discovery of Witches,"Didn't care for it too much. There is another ""Discovery of Witches"" by Harkness and I didn't know there were two so I got the wrong one. Got the other one at the library and don't care for it too much, either."
5,Silk Guachos,"The product was excellent, just as described, and the elastic waist fits perfectly, even though I didn't know this company sold maternity clothes!Also, the shipping was prompt and efficiently done, and the email communication very pleasant. A good place to shop."
3,"Cute, but might need to be tossed out with the bath water...","Okay, I bought this book, thinking it might make an interesting writing resource. Plus, I enjoy reading good pickup lines...They are usually good for a laugh if anything. But this book was not quite as funny as the author and title suggests. Also the book is printed with 3-4 LARGE pickup lines per page. (To make it worth the price, they should have at least included much more...Ahem...Material). While its no doubt cute to read over once, it lacks any practical application and has zero re-read potential. I recommend it for only the truly desperate."
3,"Good lennon voice, but the material lacks punch.","I was excited to hear about this one when it first came out, but i was disappointed after receiving it. Great lennon voice and that's it. They do sound like the beatles vocals, but this material would have been thrown out before it reached George Martin's ears..."
2,Should be called Kids Pitcher!!!!,"I bought this thinking a friend could use it in his show, but, the thing is really small definitly not what I expected. This is a kids scaled down version made for kids and young teens. Not For an adult magician. I returned it."
4,blues god,"God Mcdowell at one of his best live appearances with astonishing sound recording quality, unforgetable moment eternally within my mind and heart through this good designed disc"
2,Witch costume,I guess I got what I paid for. I ended up removing the inner liner as it was so off. I also had to sew some of the embellishments in place. The top was too short also. It almost seemed like it was sewn upside down. The hat was awesome tho and I did win a costume contest so i guess it wasn't all that bad....
3,What is the content?,Someone please give a useful review of this book! What does it cover? Etymology? Clan history? Geographic distribution? Coats of arms? How many names are covered? When was it originally published?
3,Curse of the sequel catches up to Agent 47,"I won't waste your time with talk about graphics, etc. Because we know they are awesome. I am a huge fan of the cold and methodical character known as Agent 47. But on this outing the writers went with the old 'each mission is a piece of his memory' leading up to the present. This is a notch above using time travel as an easy wrap-up to the story --but it's still a tired plot device.Someone reviewed this game and mentioned how great it was to see 47 look at himself through a glass darkly (e.g., his own memories). But really, he was far more introspective in the second Hitman game ""Hitman: Silent Assassin"" and in that game he shows his humanity to a greater degree.Hitman: Contracts is 'okay' but not great --definitely not what I was hoping for after Hitman: Silent Assassin. My rating is 4.5 stars in everything EXCEPT for the story writing (which so important to immersive enjoyment) that the game overall gets a 3-star rating."
3,Could have been better,The story line for this game was great it reviews his past missions. The graphis werte superb and the guns got better. But the game was for lack of a better word good. Not great not fantastic. The game is not worth 50$ it is worth 30 or 20 but not 50. The controls are bad too. The people who made the game should have left the orginal setup alone but if you do buy the game the training i would reccomend. Because you will need it
4,Could Have Got Better!,"First of all this game did not live upto the expectations.The main reason is SOME LEVALS OF THE FIRST GAME (Codename 47) IS BEING REPEATED (WITH THE SAME OBJECTIVES).Only little differences here and there.The new missions which they have out in is good.Now Briefly-Pros- Improved movement,Artificial Intelligence,GraphicsCons- Some levals repeated from the first part,Too easy compared the other games of Hitman.I would recommend this to anyone who is a first timer or who has already played Hitman."
2,Maybe a waste of money...,"I have been a fan of Hitman ever since it came out. I own and completed 1, 2, and Contracts. Everything about Contracts is fine--graphics, gameplay are good by today's standards. As a stand-alone game, it's worthy of 4 stars...BUT if you have played Hitman 1, then you have already played 7 of the 12 missions that Contracts contains. That's right--CONTRACTS HAS 5 NEW MISSIONS--THATS IT!!If you do not own any Hitman games, get Hitman 2. It has 20 missions that are long and diverse.If you own Hitman 2 and you don't own Hitman 1, then get Contracts. You'll probably like it and it's not a bad game.BUT if you already own Hitman 1, Contracts is a questionable buy, especially at the requested price."
3,A blast from 47's past,"Contracts begins where the original Hitman ends: Agent 47 must break out of the asylum, aka cloning facility, he was created in. Yes, the original Hitman's wonky controls and camera are history, and you can actually save limited times during missions, just like Hitman 2 Silent Assassin.There are multiple ways to play out missions, but the stealthiest choices require precise timing. Among the scenarios are revamped versions of five levels seen in the first game in the series.The AI has been beefed up, making these sprawling levels very challenging: enemies are as watchful as cobras. Furthermore, you cannot disappear by simply stepping in the shadows (like Manhunt), and any unnecessary movements will get you lined up in somebody's crosshairs.Yet even with these good points, I can't help but be disappointed with the game. I still felt like I was playing nothing more than a glorified expansion pack."
5,Wonderful!,This is a great beverage that I have enjoyed for about 2 years now...I was very disappointed to recently receive an email notifying me that is no longer available...PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!!
5,Rob Thompson,"I tried the Big Train low carb vanilla mix. It was lower in total carbs and calories, but it tasted horrible. I then tried the no sugar added. It was very good -- almost the same as the regular. It does have a signficant reduction in carbs, but the total calories are only about 10% less."
1,never sits right after consuming!,"I've enjoyed other Big Train products, but this version of their iced coffee tasted too much of dry coffee creamer. Ugh."
5,The runner's Bible,I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS PURCHASE I CHECK OUT THE DETAILS BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM I'M STUDYING OLD DAY LITERURE AND THIS WAS EXACTLLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR FROM THE DISCRIPTION POSTED ON LINE.THE SELLER WAS EXCELLENT IN ALL THERE PARTS SHIPPING AND ETC. ANOTHER GOOD BUY.
3,Sounds of Silence,"This is a comment on the dubious selection of audio clips by Amazon, not on the artist... Bravo!!! Absolutely mesmerized by the assist in evaluating The Book of Heart -- comprised about 30 seconds of no sound, whatsoever. Certainly enough of nothing on which to base this review."
2,THIS CD HAD A HONORABLE MISSION BUT IT FELL SHORT.,I AM TRULY A ROSEMARY CLOONEY FAN BUT I FELL THAT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY THIS PROJECT GOT SIDE TRACKED. SOME OF THE ARRRANGEMENTS WERE GOOD BUT AS A WHOLE THEY FELL SHORT. OF THE 14 SONGS LISTED I ONLY LIKED 5. IT'S HARD TO ALWAYS TOP WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE IN THE PAST.
5,Finally a good book about Genetic Engineering!!,"I am just a high school student, yet I undersood this book. It is great!!! It is not too technical, yet it covers what it needs to. Sections on plant, animal, and human genetic engineering make this book worth reading. No matter if you are a student with just an intrest, like me, or a genetic engineer yourself - you will enjoy this book. I get it a ten!!!"
4,Noisy but full of sense!,"Ok,ok...Here it is; completely,simply, and all noise. If your little virgin ears are not only open to FNM or any other rock/popband, you must like this album. First,you have to know that Patton recorded all this during Faith No More's tour at his hotel,after the shows. You also got to know that all those soundshave been created by sampling around him,and with his voice,ONLY!But wait,I have to say that it his noise,no musical melodies here. If you think you're ready to hear melodies made with everyday's sounds (because I assure you that the most you listen to it,the more you'll find that there's some melodies in it,no jokes!)you must buy this album!"
1,"Mike, Please come back to earth....We miss you!","Let me preface this by saying, this is not music, it's noise. Anyone could pickup a mic and make crazy sounds into it and formulate these ""songs"". Don't get me wrong, I love Patton, FNM, Fantomas, and Mr. Bungle, but you cannot seriously listen to this album. Here's an alternative, turn you TV to white static and keep hitting and unhitting the mute button, it will save you $15 and you'll get the same satisfaction."
2,"Patton, you're my hero, but this thing....","I haven't bought this album, and I won't, but I've been listening to some mp3s from it, and I'd have to say I have no bleeping idea what the hell this is! It's like Patton was bored one day and sat down with his recorder and made some funny sounds. I think I could listen to this once or twice as a novelty, but then I'd just get annoyed. I only gave it two stars because it's Mike Patton. At least his other solo album is some sort of music. He needs to spend more time recording with Mr. Bungle (so we can get a record sooner than every four years) and stop fooling around. If you're into Mr. Bungle, pick up the FANToMAS record or look for the Secret Chiefs 3 records. The FANToMAS has silly noises, but at least it goes along to music."
1,What the [heck] is this?? Read this honest review,"The guys who gave it 4 and 5 stars are just high on Angel Dust (get it..get it Angel Du..nevermind)You can simply retitle this album: MTV presents The Boredoms Unplugged (If you know who the Boredoms are give yourself 2 points). Mike Patton...with a tape recorder...making moaning, grunting, farting, kissing, hissing, barking, and any other noise you could make. No music...just a man and his mic. Don't quite know what the hell your trying to accomplish there Mikey ... I just hope others don't get dupped like I did. Kids flat out...This [stinks] ! Unless your looking for a new wacky sounds cd to play out side your house for Halloween night."
2,"Yeah, a four-track recorder ...","... combined with about 50 different Pro Tools filters! Some of these people are under the impression that he's making all these weird noises with his throat tissue. Additionally, you think this is experimental and new, try going back 25 years to a band named ""Throbbing Gristle"". Same stuff done with early synths with more screaming."
3,What gets my poverbial goat here is...,This is an experimental ambient noise album.Why are there track samples.This is an experimental ambient noise album.If you are into experimental ambient noise you don't have to hear it to know if you will enjoy it.You have to know three things: It is experimental. It is ambient. It is not music by any definition.There are plenty of bands i would like to hear before I invest capital in them. Some of them don't even get track listings. I will miss out on deciding to purchase some music that I would have enjoyed because of this wasted bandwidth and server space. Is someone going to listen to all of these and land upon some sample of thirty seconds of clicking and a chirp which makes this album a must have?
1,Don't waste your time on this poor product,First cable received from Amazon caused apps to intermittently flash and pixel signals to intermittently drop out. Everything worked OK before installing Trip lite cable. Substituting a Eizo or Viewsonic cable for the Trip lite DVI cable made problems go away. Amazon promptly shipped replacement on request which was more defective than the first: it was so bad it could not even produce an image on the monitor. What good is a lifetime warranty on a product that never works in the first place. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Sordid underside of 1950's glamour,"This movie is based on a real-life scandal, the sting operation against call-girl operations in New York in the early 1950's that entrapped margarine heir Mickey Jelke, who had fallen in love with one of the targeted courtesans. It's a fascinating, if ultimately somewhat depressing, look at just how tawdry life in the chichi ""cafe society"" of 1950's Manhattan could be under the glittering surface. There aren't any really 100% sympathetic characters in this film, which undoubtedly causes some viewers a lot of problems. The costuming, particularly the gorgeous women's clothing (the ""New Look"" era is my favorite costume period along with the Regency and late Victorian/Edwardian eras), is first-rate."
5,Zachary and his special angels...............,"This book is a treasure and a must read for all animal lovers - adults and children. It is a great teaching tool as well as a great reminder of why buying a puppy from a pet store isn't a good idea at all and why rescue, and the people who give so much to rescue are true angels among us. Ms. Arsenault captures the pain and anguish suffered by this sheltie and doesn't sugar coat the work and love and blood and sweat that went into making him whole again..............."
3,A Real Eye-Opener,"Zachary's story not only makes a chilling case against the puppy mills that supply pet stores, but also answers all your questions about what animal rescue really does. Written in simple language accessible to children in primary grades, it is a classic story of the ""Black Beauty""/""Lassie Come Home"" genre, and should be mandated reading for anyone who owns, has owned, or might own a pet."
3,Who can resist these fiesty beauties?,"Alright, the matches are from the 3rd and 4th seasons:Vicky Victory (w/ Justice at ring side) vs DaisyBig Bad Mama and MTV vs Zelda and Mt. FijiCheyenne Cher vs BeastieGodiva vs NinotchkaMt. Fiji vs Star and BeastieBig Bad Mama and MTV vs Cheyenne Cher and Vicky VictoryAlso included are the comedy skits and the usual rap video entrances by the ladies. This dvd fits along nicely with the other GLOW releases. Its still too short...only being an hour long. Can't really say anything else about this. If you're a GLOW fan you already know what to expect. Show your devotion, buy the dvd, so we can get even more GLOW!"
4,Data Smog filled with Good Information,"Mr. Shenk does a fine job of informing us of the potential pitfalls of the information explosion. He uses excellent examples of how too much information stuns some people, makes others tune out all information or disbelieve most information, prevents others from discerning from true and false information, creates in some people a constant anxiety that they are not up to speed, or drive some people to seek the simplest solution from an ever more complicated world.Mr. Shenk also provides several rational antidotes to this data smog. From limiting one's access to information, using care in output amount and distribution, to working with government to control data smog, Mr. Shenk provides reasonable solutions.Since the book only focuses on the bad side of the information glut, one needs to be careful when reading the book not to forget the huge benefits in productivity and standard of living that are achieved with increased access to information."
4,Effects or information through technoloy,"David Shenk's broad insight into technology, covering mostly the computer and internet, covers the many possible causes of stress, addiction, confusion, misunderstanding, etc.... and most importantly our thought process. If you have ever been afflicted or affected by these or any other of technologies problems. David Shenk gives his own practical solutions to such problems in part 4 of his book Data Smog. ""All technologies introducted into our human ecosystem come with a raft of expected and unexpected consequences."" If you decide to read the first 3 parts of Shenk's book, he will explain the direct effect technology has on the whole of society. He certainly will unveil the many indirect effects of technology. ""Above all else, it is imperative that in the coming years we strive to keep the quality of our thinking as great as the quality of our information."""
4,"What happened to this innovative, inventive band?","""High Flying Kid Stuff"" is an extraordinary release that actually deserves five stars, but the production leaves much to be desired. Listening to this music takes me back to the days of childhood innocence when the world was still fresh and new, and not the nightmarish place you conclude it to be the more you grow up. Although an underlying sinister element and adult themes are evident in the music, Julie Shields keeps the tone light and happy, as her vocal style is somewhat reminiscent of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Please do not interpret this as insulting or demeaning, as her style offers a nice juxtaposition with the occasional heavy sounds, although interpreting lyrics can be difficult. If someone could tell me whatever became of this band, I would truly appreciate it."
5,Hard to find... worth the leg work,"This was one of those discoveries that happened in my own back yard. I know as well as anyone that the Kansas City area isn't the Epoch of new and innovative music so imagine my surprise when this Overland Park based trio blew me out of the water.The whole album is almost like a whispy video game dream with lots of creative high notes. Missle Command is the perfect mini-epic. Birthday is the perfect mantra for melancoly folk, and King of the Wide Eyed Girls is just funky cool.If you buy one Shallow album, this is their best. (3D Stereo Trouble would be my second place pick...)Currently Shallow is disbanded (the drummer moved to the coast I think...) but the heart and soul of the band carries on. They've since refocused and renamed themselves as the Capsules. Reverser (by the Capsules) is also very good, but far more mellow in tone."
5,A great punk album for any punk fan,"this is just a great punk band. when i got it i was sorta not expecting to much rock outta it, but when i heard it, it was great, a must buy for any rock fan."
5,Just Plain Genius,Now alot of people out there may not have heard of this band but that doesnt mean they arent good. In fact they are one of my favorite bands and i have to say Jeff Ott is probably one of the reasons they are so good. his lyrics are as thought provoking as they are fun to listen to. This is a definate buy for any true punk fan.
1,Unlistenable,"I bought this a while back on the recommendation of a friend who praised it as the be-all, end-all of indie punk. I tried. Believe me, I tried. The messages, lyrics, ad ideas may be right on, but the music itself is bland and only so-so, pretty basic acoustic folk. And the vocals? God almighty, I can not get over how terrible Jeff Ott sounds on this thing. The sound is mixed horribly, the vocals are mixed WAY too loud, he sings completely off-key, it's just, well, words simply can't describe how utterly bad the singing is. I tried many times to like it, honestly I did. I just can't. It seems to me the good reviews of this CD are more because of the messages than the music itself. I appreciate good songwriting, but only when it's put to good song. It's a shame, because I really liked Crimpshrine (Ott's old band) but to me, this CD was wasted money because it is completely unlistenable, it's just not pleasing to the human ear."
3,So-so,"While it's impossible to find Mars bars in the US, I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. The shipping process occurred in a very timely fashion. I was a little surprised as to how the bars were packaged - all loose inside the box. And while the taste is wonderful, the candy bars were quite stale. So, I guess I will have to get my Mars bars fix when across the ocean."
5,mars bars,"The mars bars are one of the best candy bars you can find. Unfortunately, you can only find them in the U.K. and Europe.I'm glad I found a website I could find them."
5,great candy,cant get these here in usa. gald I found them in our neighboring country canada. Love these... thanks for still making them!
3,Not a true Mars Bar,I ordered these for a friend who loved the old American Mars bars. While these were good they were more like a Milky Way and contained no almonds.
3,"Strong, but not great","Being a fan of turntableism, I love the instrumental portions of this album. Swamp's rapping could use a little work, though. It's interesting and different, especially ""worship the robots,"" but they aren't going to be the next club hits. ""Worship the Robots"" is interesting and fun because the lyrics were written into Simple Text, a program on a Mac, and it is Simple Text that does all of the rapping. Interesting and something completely different. Overall there are some tracks that are catchy and fun, but others just don't hit the mark."
1,JUNK KEYBOARD,"JUNK--THERE IS NO ""NUMBER"" KEY GROUP PAD AND RETURN BUTTON KEY BROKE IN LESS THAN (1) MONTH!!!"
5,excellent for dexterity issues and seniors,"As far as sturdy, this board is definitely rugged and damage resistant. I purchased one for my mother who has arthritis and has problems with buttons on traditional keyboards being too close together. Her eyesight is also failing, so have the big letters was a huge plus. The keyboard does take some getting used to if you're used to traditional keyboards. My mother quickly learned however to become a two-finger typist on this board. Not having function keys is the only problem, although if you're not setting up windows xp for the first time (where you HAVE to have an F8 button to accept the license), there is not much need for function buttons. Overall, this keyboard is extremely helpful and well worth the price for the value it provides for an older person with motor or vision problems."
3,Frost at Christmas,This is a very easy book to read it is very 1960s and quite humorous Inspector Jack Frost is so politically incorrect.
3,Frost Books,"I bought the Frost series because I loved the BBC series ""A Touch of Frost"". While the series is very true to the stories told in the books, the books lack the personality and charm of the TV series. I was highly disappointed."
3,A caricature of the series,"Another frost mystery. Not so well done. This series may develop into a caricature of itself if the author is not careful about exaggerating the faults and pettiness of the commanding officers. Frost is investigating a local junkie's death, unpopular Detective Inspector Jack Frost watches things go from bad to worse as he stalks a runaway teenager, a burglar, a hit-and-run driver, and a tabloid criminal known as the Hooded Terror."
4,My first Frost book won't be my last!,"Having seen the tv show from the UK, I was intrigued (but not surprised) to learn there is a book series behind the program. The book keeps you guessing not only about ""whodunit,"" but also about whether or not the crimes are inter-related. Frost's character is amusing, as is his co-workers' reactions to him. I think there is more than a little shock value in Wingfield's humor. All in all, an entertaining read! I can't wait to get started on the rest of the novels!"
2,Coarse tone and surface noise of the direct-from-LPs transfers,"See my (not very favorable) review under this set's other entry:Purcell - Trio Sonata No. 9 / Handel - Trio Sonata Op. 2 No. 8 / Viotti - Duo in G major / Spohr - Duios Op. 67 No. 2 & 3 / Beethoven - Sonata Op. 30 No. 2 & Op. 47 ""Kreutzer / Franck - Sonata in A major - Gioconda De Vito (2 CD Set)."
2,Rough cut,"This Dado set by Delta produces rough cuts and edges with significant bat wings (.005""-.010"" deep). I also had problems with mounting the blades on the arbor (center hole too small). The set is only suitable for general carpentry."
5,Almost like being there!,"Ive seen portions of the old paintings in other publications, but there's nothing like this VERY COLLECTIBLE piece. Its a treasure, because of the painstaking care in preserving the original authenticity of the works, and allowing you to closely examine the ""before"" detail, and then the ""after"" restoration detail. Most of all, the book allowed me to gain an appreciation that I never had for this great artist. Thanks"
4,An excellent book.,"The image quality in this book is excellent. I have never been to Vatican. So it's hard to judge whether the color is right. I just try to use this book to study anatomy after Michelangelo. For some parts of frescoes, this book provides enlarged pictures. Some images show the frescoes before restoration, although not in detail. In general, it's a great reference book for my study."
1,Halloween Queen,"I gave this video a try because it was such a reasonable price. It was a disappointment. It was far too basic, even showing you how to carve a plain jack-o-lantern. Seriously??? There were some demonstrations for more complicated designs, but there just wasn't much to the demonstrations. At one point, the person carving the pumpkin was pushing the carving tool toward her other hand - one slip and she would have gouged her hand - not a very safe demonstration.There were a couple of cute ideas for pumpkins, but nothing that I hadn'e seen in books. I thought the video loops would include a jack-o-lantern that I could play at a party. The loops were very weird and exactly the same as the loops that appear on a similar halloween craft video."
3,"Complete, but short and lacked detail","I was probably a little too optimistic about this DVD. i bought it instead of a book because my spouse never seems to get around to reading a book. Plus, this would be easier to share with the school staff. I felt it was a complete summary, but unfortunately it lacked depth and detail. I felt more examples for prevention strategies could have been given especially for home behaviors."
4,Pyle PLD53MUT DVD/CD/MP3 AM/FM Receiver with 2.5-Inch LCD Screen and TV Tuner,This purchase was done in a very pr0ofessional manner. The item is as expected and it arrived on time.Very happy. I would shop again.
2,problemas con el articulo,"Me encuentro disconforme con articulo Pyle PLD53MUT debido a que con sÃ³lo un dÃ­a de uso el control remoto se daÃ±o y no funciona y el radio tiene muchas funciones que solo con el control funcionan.Al control remoto le cambiamos la bateria y no dio resultado esperado, trate de conseguir un control nuevo a mediados de noviembre que estuve en Miami y Orlando pero nolo conseguÃ­;llÃ¡me a los telÃ©fonos de pÃ¡gina de pyle y no hubo comunicaciÃ³n.LlevÃ© el control donde un tÃ©cnico en electrÃ³nica y considera que el problema es con la radio.Soy amante del buen sonido siempre he tenido una sola marca reconocida para todo el equipo. No tengo queja con PYLE por el sonido y el video ya que los considero de buena calidad y buen diseÃ±o"
4,A moving and touching tale,"This book seems so modern, yet it takes place just after WWII. It is the story of a poet and intellectual, Hilary Wainwright, who lost his wife during the war and, so he thinks, his newborn son. He left his wife in Paris just as the Germans were moving in, and now after the war he returns to a ravaged France after he's told his son may still be alive in an orphanage in Normandy. It is short, expertly written, moving almost to the point of melodrama (it's only slight flaw, perhaps a feature of the time)and it will have you devouring it in one sitting. I really can't tell more without giving away the simple story line, read it..it's wonderful."
3,"Interesting Story, Non-Interesting Character","This book was difficult to read because I simply could not find anything to like about the main character Hilary. He came across to me as self-involved and truly a pathetic man. While he experienced a traumatic event in his life, I felt he let that dictate the course for the rest of his life. I feel readers would benefit from having an introduction or foreword added to the book giving some additional background on the history of the time period and attitudes of people living at that time. Our book club selected this book and it did spark some interesting discussion."
5,A Masterpiece!,"Finally, a book that explains idioms in a way my son can understand-clearly and unambiguously. Because he has an autistic spectrum disorder, he tends to be very literal. He has read this book from cover to cover and is starting to incorporate idioms, usually correctly, into conversation. In addition, the author presents the history (if known) of each idiom, something children(mine) who enjoy factoids love.This book should be required reading for speech therapists, teachers, the language-delayed, and those learning English as a second language."
4,Interesting,"Fairly good source for origins of idioms. Not all are here, but many. Some ""conjecture"" as to origin on many, but they do seem logical. A good over-all (particularly sufficient for elementary level) resource & nice leisure reading."
4,Idioms,"I have this book at school where I teach. It's a good source for idioms, but of course, far from complete. This particular book was bought as a gift for my son-in-law who needed a list of idioms"
3,Good but incomplete,"While this is a fun book to read through, if you are using it to look up common idioms, this is not the book for you. Many of the common idiomatic expressions we use in our family are simply not in the book at all. This has been a source of frustration as we have tried to look up explanations for the origins of these expressions as well as meanings of common expressions."
5,Wonderful,This is a great compilation of Shirley Caesar songs. Her voice is just so soothing and uplifting. If you like Gospel you need this album
2,no diagnosis help,"While the DVD shows very well how to easily open and replace components in a carb, it fails to show how to diagnose lean conditions in 2 strokes and lean/rich in 4 strokes. The presenter blips the throttle 6 or so times and tells us it is lean because it didn't ""take"" or rich because it felt ""fluffy"" (or some similar term). I was very disapointed that I could not return the product since it did nothing for my understanding of diagnosis."
2,Doesn't cover multi-carburetor tuning,"This video is informative, but it focuses on dirt bikes and ATVs with a single carburetor. There is no material on synchronizing or tuning a multi-carb engine."
3,Umm...,"A noble undertaking, and historically commendable, but entirely too operatic and self-serious, I think, to really convey what Partch was trying get at. Buy the CRI Harry Partch discs instead."
1,Save Your Money,"I found no humor what so ever in this book. Erroneous Scouting information. Poorly concieved, poorly written and poorly laid out. 50 pages of nothing for $7.95. Somebody thought he had a good idea and should have kept the thought to himself. Would not even make a good campfire starter. Save your money."
1,Horribly dissapointing,"As a Woodbadge trained adult leader, I have to say I am completely dismayed by this book. There are enough real-life events on any given Scouting event to twice as many pages with humourous anecdotes. This book contained little more than humorless stories with even worse punch lines. Seriously-- a story about a kid getting carsick all the time culminating in a punchline where he took medicine for it may be funny to a first grader with a poor sense of humor, but hardly worth the effort to read the page where the story appeared. The only things remotely funny in this slim overpriced pamphlet were the fake ads in the back of the book--and they weren't all that funny.. I recommend that everyone save their money and avoid this rubbish."
1,I Guess I Just Don't Get it...,"Though I pride myself on my sense of humor, I didn't find anything at all funny or entertaining about this book. It took about 10 minutes to read. It might take you a few minutes longer if you actually find one of the stories worth reading thoroughly. I didn't. There's no story longer than one page, yet it still managed to lose me before the end of every ""story.""Maybe if you're 11 or 12 years old, this might be funny, though I can't vouch for that. It is definitely juvenile, if nothing else. If you're an adult scouter looking for a memorable story or a scouting-related laugh, look somewhere else.I read the book and immediately threw it into the wastebasket. I've never done that before."
1,A five minute read,"I bought this book for my 9 year old scout. Having read it, it doesn't rise to ""silly"". It would take him 5 minutes to read it, learn nothing, no laughs and no re-read value. I wasted eight dollars."
4,A Madcap of Tales,"I recently read this book and got a great chuckle at these short funny stories. I read the stories to my scouts and they really enjoyed it. A must read to younger Boy Scouts, especially at a campfire or troop opening."
1,poor use of ink and paper,"This book, if you can call it that, is the search for cash on the good name of the Boy Scouts. Save your money. This person was clearly a warped scout indeed if they can rip people off with such a poor work. No Eagle values or OA honor here. Stay away!"
3,"""Interesting"" is the word...","As an avid fan of Fischerspooner's last outing, the underground smash, #1, I can say that their latest endeavor (Odyssey) is a bit of a departure from the banging beats of its predeccessor.Is that a bad thing? Yes and no. Sure, ""Odyssey"" has its fair share of entertaining electroclash moments, but #1 thrived on its ability to get your pulse up, with such hits as ""Emerge"", ""Sweetness"" and ""Mega-colon"". ""Odyssey"" shows how Fischerspooner is approaching a more ambient, Postal Service-esque sound; I enjoy The Postal Service, but I expected something a bit more uptempo and ostentatious from Fischerspooner.Any avid fan of Fischerspooner will be loyal, and enjoy it. But those looking for the uptempo clashes of the last album might be a tad disappointed."
5,Blazing FS,"Fischerspooner rocked in 2001 with their #1 release which made 80's new wave/synth pop hip again based on the sole strength of Emerge and The #15.In 2005, Fischerspooner capitalized on their assets and conjured an amazing album which relied less on new wave/synth pop but more on their personal creations of electronica dance rock. The superior Just Let Go picked up where #1 left off and resulted in a stunning anthem-like track. Cloud, co-produced with the famed Mirwais Ahmadzai works equally well with a familiar satrt-stop beginning, retro-electronic and a dream-like chorus. Other winners include the sexy Get Confused and Emerge Part 2, A Kick In The Teeth.This is definitely a great electronic/dance album not to be missed."
3,GOES DOWN EASY,"More catchy and tuneful, but far less adventurous than their first CD. It all goes down very easy, but there's nothing as freakin' cool as Emerge, or as haunting as 15th, or as funny as Mega Colon, or as sonically stimulating as Invisible. What we get instead is lots of pop songs and pop song structures. They're playing it very safe. Casey's dead pan, over-processed vocals grow tiring after awhile, but kudos to FS for not abandoning their sparse electro sound pallet; even with the `lectric guitars, it still stays true to the FS vibe. They're touring as a ""real band"" this time around and not as a lip synching performance art act, as before. Guessing there'll be no spitting up blood this time out. As for Casey's blond, back-lit perm... Yikes!"
4,One of my favorites this year,"I didn't care for Fischerspooner's first album. This one in comparison, in my opinion, is much much better. The sound is more polished. It's more electro-pop which seems to work better for them. The songs are memorable and have melodies. Some favorites include ""Cloud,"" ""Never Win,"" ""A Kick In the Teeth,"" ""We Need a War,"" and ""Happy"". The reviewer who compared them to Postal Service is spot on, which is another great cd worth checking out. I was pleasantly surprised by this one and it gets a lot of play in my cd player. Check it out!"
4,Great electronica album,This record by FS is more organic... less Kraftwerk and more AIR.You can listen to the entire album (streaming) here:http://www.heavy.comThen buy it! :)
4,Definitely better than #1,"I didn't really like #1 other than Emerge, but Odyssey proves without a doubt that Fischerspooner is going to stick around. I definitely see the similarities between A Kick in the Teeth and some Postal Service songs... It's a really beautiful song, and I think it should have been a single instead of Just Let Go.Overall, the best tracks are Never Win and A Kick in the teeth, but Cloud, Get Confused, Just let go, and Happy are also really good. For some reason, Just let go kind of annoys me, because even though it's a really strong track, the best parts are the guitar riffs, but they're really short and underplayed, so the song just seems to be going in two different directions. I think their next album will be very interesting to hear."
5,Yum Yum and double Yum!,"A must have for Champagne lovers and Cocktail fans alike, there are some delicious celebration drinks here and they make a great change from the usaul wine and beer nights!Next time you have reason to buy some Moet et Chandon or reach for some Cava Brut, consider how you might make them even more special with this book. Perfect for parties, Birthdays and Christmas; heck any celebration really!"
4,Traffic and Weather by Fountains of Wayne,A bit unusual for this 63 year old but I do like the latest trends in current music. I would recommend this to my friends and family too!
4,FoW continue to burst with great music...,"When I first bought TaW, my first reaction was, ""Not bad, but nothing stands out. In fact, this sounds like all their past stuff."" Granted, FoW haven't changed their formula for witty lyrics, loud guitars, and catchy hooks and choruses at all. But after a period, the album really grew on me! To those of you that are longtime fans that haven't found the album all that special, give it a chance! And to those of you that are new to FoW, if you're at least familiar with bands like Cheap Trick, The Knack, and Material Issue, definitely give it a listen! By the way, just saw FoW at the Copley Square Park here in Boston. They really put on a great live show!"
3,Sorry - it's a disappointment.,"Long-time fan here, and I'll be brief: it's not a bad album, but it's a let-down. I bought their original release in '96, I had most of ""Out-of-State Plates"" from bootlegs before it was released, and my copy of ""I want an Alien for Christmas"" is the original CD single. So I'm not some casual fan. The album just sounds like we've heard it all before. A few catchy tunes, but overall nothing that great that stands out. Just so you know where I stand, I rank WIS as my favorite FoW CD, followed by their debut. This ranks behind them, near Utopia Parkway. Just my $.02!"
5,We Belong Together,"I had a similar reaction to Traffic and Weather as I did to XTC's new albums (back in the days when they were released semi-regularly): Mild dispappointment.And as with those XTC projects of yesteryear, continued listening revealed that the songs on Fountain of Wayne's latest are ear candy of the highest quality. Funny, catchy, and varied, I especially appreciated that the songwriters add the little details that give the songs weight and meaning. Great stuff (and they're a terrific live act, too!)"
3,You can tell it's become a job.,"I personally really liked their previous album, ""Out Of State Plates"". Considering that it was a collection of leftovers and demos, some of the songs were outstanding. I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of their next studio album. I waited and waited, and finally came ""Traffic and Weather.""I found it very anticlimactic. On a first run through, some of the songs sounded like they had some promise, but none of them grow on you. There's no depth to them. It gives me the impression that they were contractually obligated to do this album, and they begrudgingly tossed a bunch of songs on it. The schtick that worked for them on previous efforts just feels forced here."
3,"Next, please...","Let's see: the Gap, Dockers, Subaru, King of Queens, Doritos... are these guys getting kickbacks for product placement?That aside, the slice-of-life quaintness has now become twee and a little annoying.In retrospect, Welcome Interstate Managers did have a couple weak tracks. Traffic and Weather reminds me of those. Nothing here measures up to ""All Kinds of Time"" or ""Red Dragon Tattoo"" or ""The Senator's Daughter"" or ""Radiation Vibe"" or ""No Better Place"". And they've used cheezy 80's synth solos before, but not with such lackluster abandon. I've seen them in concert twice and they were swell, but now it's probably time for the group to point their Survival Car in a new direction.p.s. rhyming ""Window"" and ""Pinto"" is kind of funny, but rhyming ""van"" and ""gentleman"" is just lazy."
4,Spend the money !!!,"It isn't on par with ""Welcome Interstate Managers"", but it's bright and bouncy. The lyrics are witty and sometimes down right wicked. It's just good fun and well worth the investment."
4,Ripley is back!,"I'm sure all true ALIEN-philes already bought and read this book! But perhaps you're not one of these guys, so I'll tell you what I think about this novel! Of course, this novel tells the story of the movie in a much more detailed way - which is a really good thing, I think (To be quite honest, I had to read this book to be finally able to understand the causal chains of some of the dialogues in the movie!). In my opinion the development of the relationship between Ripey and Call is the highlight of this book! It's much better described than in the movie. But I also felt some scenes quite differently when I saw ""ALIEN: RESURRECTION"" at the cinema than A.C. Crispin writes in the book (But I felt the samy way about Alan Dean Foster's first three ""ALIEN""-novels, by the way.). But I'm an ALIEN-phile which means I still love this book! My suggestion for you would be: watch the movie first (because that's the REAL thing!), then read the book, and finally make up your own idea!"
5,Alien Ressurection is the BEST!,"I loved this book from start to finish. I loved how it described the clones and Gediman and Wren's motives very well. Christie, Distepano, and Vreiss were awesome. Purvis, Call, and Perez were O.K. Hillard, Elgyn, and Johner were complete idiots. and Ripley was definentley the best. I enjoyed the cool descriptions of every character and exciting scene. The way the Newborn was described is great. I loved this book"
5,WOW,"NOTE: I am reviewing the song ""The Story"" because it's the only one I've heard all the way through (I got it for free with itunes free weekly single).Amazing talent. I'm considering buying the whole album."
4,A great album,"Brandi Carlile had produced three records prior to being signed. So this album sounds far more mature than one might expect from a 'first effort' out of the gate. But, this isn't her first effort.It has a slightly softer edge than ""The Story"", but is every bit as compelling.This is one song writer singer who will be around a long time, and I'll wager she'll become far more important as the years pass."
4,Just as good in concert.........,"So Saturday night I go see Jamie Cullum live at the 9:30 club. Brandi was the opening act. When I saw her come onstage with ""The Twins"" and two other band members, I honestly thought the worst. By the third song, I was making my way back to the concession stand to get her cd. I was amazed by her vocal range and the emotion in each song, especailly on Closer To You. In concert, she did the Jeff Buckley cover of Hallelujah. I only wish that was on this album, but her performance was so strong, I can close my eyes and remember every note of that song on that night. I was really happy to see Jamie that night, but I was fortunate to come across Ms. Brandi Carlisle and her band."
5,Incredible voice!,Brandi's voice is one that can give me chill bumps. It's music that you sing along with at the top of your lungs and wish you could grasp her range. They're songs that you sit in the drive way and listen to so you can sing the rest of the song before you get out. I love the lyrics. They are so heartfelt. I would love to see her in concert.
5,Awesome from-the-heart singer,"I first heard Brandi as she sang background (What Can I Say?) at the close of Amy Grants' ""3 Wishes"" TV show in 2005. She sounded so good for that one minute, I found her album and bought it. Recently my wife and I got to see her 'open' with Shawn Colvin in a small, 300 seat venue and the two were spectacular together. Shawn even brought Brandi back out for a duet. Brandi has an amazingly honest and emotional voice. I, also, bought a copy for a friend and a couple more for Christmas this year."
5,"Really, REALLY good","I got tired of all my music CDs and so I went looking for more. Assorted searches on Amazon and following the leads for ""customers who bought this title also bought..."" brought me to Brandi Carlile's CD. I'd never heard of her, and the cover photo was a bit misleading (when it arrived, my husband asked if I was now buying punk music), but I ordered this based on the snippets of song samples--they sounded like what I was looking for.As another reviewer stated, I can't stop listening to it. I bought several female vocalist CDs in a period of about a week, but this is the music I always reach for. Every song is great on its own, and the more you hear them and get to know them, the better they get.Buy this CD!"
1,What a load of tripe,"Based solely on the clips of the first four songs, this album sounds like a total waste of money. The clips all sounded the same, and what they sounded like was a white teenage girl going ""wah!"" If I wanted to hear that, I'd go to the university cafeteria, tape the banal chatter of the local Delta Delta Delta sorostitutes, and pay some drunk frat boy to strum 3 chords for background music. Yeech.Who knows, maybe the other clips were better. I kind of doubt it, but maybe."
4,very good,"I tried to distract from my usual preferencies by ordering this album of Carlile,whose name did not ring a bell. to me and was not mistaken"
5,Destined to be around for a long time.....,"What a phenomenal debut album! It really blew me away, not only upon first listen, but by the fact that you discover so much more each and every time you listen to the album. The lyrics are powerful, but its her soulful, rich, magnificent voice that really gives you goosebumps. She is a true musical and lyrical talent who is destined to be around for a long time! There are hints of the Indigo Girls and Melissa Ethridge in her vocal quality, yet she remains unique and original. I HIGHLY recommend this album!!!UPDATE: I saw her perform in concert last night and she was even better in person, if that can be believed! She sounds incredible live and the audience was truly blown away. If she's ever playing in your area, I HIGHLY recommend seeing her play live....she'll knock your socks off!"
3,"Great voice, great first effort","I don't know how old Brandi Carlile is, but she looks WAY too young to have that powerful of a voice. I heard the song ""Follow"" on my local public radio station and knew I had to have the CD.I sort of hate to draw comparisons, but Brandi's voice reminds me of Sheryl Crow mixed with Stevie Nicks--a bit gravelly and very sensual without trying to be so.None of the accompanying instruments are overbearing or overplayed, and I love the use of strings and minor keys. Nobody is trying to be a hero on this album; the sound engineer and producer both should be applauded.I think it's worth a listen. None of my friends have been sorry after giving this CD a try."
5,Great Album from Start to Finish,"I had heard the song The Story and was instantly interested to hear more of this artist. I listened to this self titled album and I can't get enough of it! Comparable to Patty Griffin and Melissa Ethridge, but shines on her own as a great artist with a strong, soulful voice, great lyrics and ability to keep me eager for more.I highly recommend this album."
5,Awesome talent,This CD will embrace and move you. She has a powerful voice and a distinctive quality that I don't know how to describe other than to say it sounds like Seattle rock and Nashville country. Very moving.
5,Elvis Who?,"This release is a miracle. Phil Schaap and Sony Music have done it again. When you take into account that no two tape machines play at precisely the same speed at any time and there was no timecode on the original,I continue to marvel at how well Schaap and his engineers at CBS Syncronized this. The sound is so clean it's as though this concert was recorded yesterday. You are put right in the front row! The Bass drums boom. The horns Blare. There are some flubs, miscues and so forth, but that's all right. There is a warmth and presence to this recording that blows the lid off most of the digital recordings I own. Hearing this release begs the question ""Is digital really better than analog?"" Put this on,relax and go back in time!"
4,where are the liner notes?,The back cover of the CD mentions new extensive liner notes by Phil Schaap. Where are they? Inside I find only a listing of the track breakpoints and a miniature version of the original liner notes. Nothing by Schaap.
5,elling at newport,rhese song on this are some great jazz music if you real want to remember some songs by one of greatest performer
3,Ellington At Newport 1956,"I would have been satisfied with the live content, as indicated by the title, on a single disc. Two discs with studio recordings duplicating the same titles and adding others was irritating and detracted from the ambience. I transferred the real stuff to a single separate disc for satisfactory listening."
4,Ellington at Newport,I purchased this item primarily for use in a college jazz history class. The quality is excellent and I'm delighted to be able to bring this historically important performance to life for my students.
2,To much emcee talk,"I recently bought this CD based partly on the reviews from this site. I always buy music CDs for the music. However, I was dissapointed with the amount of emcee introductions and talk that make up such a measurable part of the first CD. I would much rather have music. Dukes got a great singing voice, but do I really want to hear him introduce every bandmember EVERY time I listen to this CD? I would much rather have a studio recording and enjoy great uninterrupted Jazz. The other disappointment were those shrill, piercing horns on some tracks. I found those sounds irritating and anything but enjoyable."
4,Awesome.,I bought this strictly for the solo on Diminuendo/Crescendo in Blue. Was pleasantly surprised to discover that the rest of the album was just as good!
2,The African Colonial State in Comparative Perspective.,"I'm sorry, I just couldn't get started with this book, and that's a shame because I have a feeling it has some worthwhile information in it.It ""sounds"" like exactly what I was looking for; but it's written in that ""textbook"" fashion, I mean really boring, a struggle to try to read and I gave up on it after about 50 pages."
3,3 good stories,"The first story was weak, pulling down the rating. The other two were very good, especially Eagle's. She never fails to deliver."
3,Strange person,"This doco introduces American poet Charles Bukowski to missed a master passed round a globe comprehensively by dismantling his routine life substantially.Personally, his ""Born into this"" left a dual impression-both as a poetry and for a personality of an author not eligible for a military service in a war time.Educative surely."
5,Like is a Bunny From Heck,"Bukowski: strangely charming, funny, introspective, out of control. Bukowski cronies: thoughtful, candid, coolsville. Famous guys: strangely out of place, Bukowski could have been Ronald McDonald to all except Waits. This is a moving piece of work about a difficult character. A fascinating peek at the creative process told by somebody who understands it, not glossied up like some Errol Morris hollywood job, just what it is. Dullughan should take on James Ellroy next."
4,Good,"The seller was quick and the item was great but the price as a little high and I was disappointed to see it on Netflix for free,"
5,Bukowski Rules,"This biopic is truly a must for avid Bukowski fans. The man was a legend in his own time, though he roamed under the radar for decades before being published. His lifestyle was so typical 1950's southern Californa that it brings back images of growing up middle-classed and Catholic in my own mind. Buy it!!!"
3,earcovers,"Love these = however, one broke the first time I wore it.. the innards are plastic and now it won't stay on. Hope the others last better...second one seems to be holding up."
4,They're ear warmers,Work fine. Well constructed. A little tight. If you have to wear them a long time you might feel slightly uncomfortable. Altogether just as good as more well known brands.
4,good basic warmth,The Gorgonz 7700 were what I expected and wanted. They made a great gift to 2 friends who also were pleased with fit and feel of product.
5,Excellent for cold weather,"Snuggly, adjustable, collapsible, and warm.I debated springing for the more expensive models, and I'm glad I didn't.I don't know what's better about the others models, but these are just great."
2,Basic Fleece Ear Warmers,"I had bought these for may Husband, He did'nt like them Because, He Said they did'nt fit. They were too small, he is not a large man. He said they were not very soft. So I don't think these should be only sold children."
1,Oh man...,"Oh no. No no no... Please don't consider this CD. If any of you actually knew where Cardcaptors came from and what it originaly was, you would never EVER buy this. The original Cardcaptors was actually called Card Captor Sakura and it was a cute and lovable show from Japan and focused on Sakura and her quest to collect the Clow Cards. What was released in the US was some sort of hell spawn. The music is no better."
2,...,"I have not actually heard the Original songs apart from one which was occassionally used for the American opening credits...and I have to say it was better than this. As much as I like Cardcaptors/Cardcaptor Sakura, this music is...let's say...not that great. For a soundtrack CD, wouldn't it be better if it had soundtracks on it?"
1,If you ever knew...,"If you knew what these songs really sounded like, they sound like (...) that was probably made by Britney Spears or something.Something that would make you die! No, these songs are not like Sailor Moon where they actually fit. They don't at all.When you listen to this, it might sound good if you're a britney spears fan.. or some nsync fan or something. I, for one, am definately NOT an American pop fan. Gosh, just go buy the original Cardcaptor Sakura cd! The music is far better than what you hear from Cardcaptors. More like Cardcraptors. Don't buy it.I haven't watched CCS yet, but I will, seeing how Cardcraptors turned out.. yuck, gross. If you hate the introduction song of Cardcraptors, you'll hate the rest of the (...) songs they came out with."
3,could be better!,"I really think they could've done a better job with this CD. It's not too bad, but save your money, and buy the original japanese Card Captor Sakura soundtracks. They're WAY better. ^^"
2,It was ok. I heard better.,"This total disappointed me, cause the songs weren't like on the TV series as said. So I like song Tell me that's #2, Invisible me that's #3, and Ordinary girl that's #8. There's more but these sre the best I think. OK later fans"
1,IS THIS A POKEMON CD????? IT SUCKS!,"I'm still wondering if I bought the cardcaptors cd or the newest Pokemon CD, since the music sounds the SAME! It seems to me like this people just took the lyrics+music for the newest Pokemon music project, and put it on the Cardcaptors cd. It has NO creativity, no imagination, and the track we are expecting ""Ordinary girl"" does NOT sounds like the one on the episode ""the third element"". Pretty similar, but IT'S NOT THE ONE on the episode. It sounds good for a RADIO EDIT, but NOT for the album version. This cd simple [isn't good], so if you want to buy the newst Pokemon wanna be cd, buy this cd."
3,It was ok. I heard better.,"This total disappointed me, cause the songs weren't like on the TV series as said. So I like songs( Tell me, that's #2, Invisible me, that's #3, and Ordinary girl, that's #8. There's more but these sre the best I think. OK later fans."
5,Awesome FAST Laser Printer,"I have 4 of these printers. I am a teacher and have 2 of the 1710n and 2 of the 1710. They are great printers, very fast. First page comes out within seconds. The toner lasts quite a while... as a teacher I know this as we do a lot of printing in my classroom."
1,Don't waste your $$$,We have 6 of these printers in the office I work and they have inspired me to write this review. They're lousy... They fail all the time - paper jams are difficult to resolve and this is the case with all 6 - so I know it's not just the one model at my desk. This printer is no good. All 6 in the office suffer the same issues. Spend your $$$ elsewhere.
3,Not sure if meant for parents,"I am a parent, and using this book to teach my 4th grader. Contents do not drive step-by-step learning process, it rather felt like an instruction book for grade teachers.If I knew how to teach writing, then I could use this book to know different techniques and material to improve."
3,don't get two,This product works great however you cannot have two of them in the house. The remote transmission reaches over 70ft though several walls in my house and one remote will turn on both machines. They should have a warning about this on the description.
4,Works well so far,I use two of these Ace Lamson units on the same frequency to turn on two separate lights at the same time.I can switch the jumpers if need be.I can find the 12-volt batteries at local hardware stores. No problem.
2,Issues,"I received one of these as a gift a few years ago, and liked the product. Finding it very functional, I decided to purchase 2 more. There were quality control issues with the 2 units I recently received. One plug-in receiver unit didn't work at all. The plastic on the jumpers used in the plug-in receivers and remote control transmitters, on both units fell apart when resetting the codes (strange). I replaced them with my own jumpers. I didn't bother to return the one defective unit, because I was able to use the transmitter as an extra."
5,Very Handy,"I use this to turn off lights in 2 rooms and it works, better than I would have thought. Also the little remote allows me to have it in the kitchen and I can make sure all unnessary lights aren't on when leaving.It arrived quickly and was in new packing. Also obvious that the insides were brand new.Amazon Verified Purchase"
3,Does Not Contain All Original 33 Stories,"I misunderstood that this collection contained all thirty-three of the short stories as originally published in 1911. It does not. Beware that the table of contents depicted in the ""Look Inside"" function on the webpage does not correspond to this edition of the book."
3,33 short stories of mixed quality,"COUNTRY OF THE BLIND is a collection of 33 short stories hand picked by H.G. Wells as his best. The stories were written first published between 1894 and 1906 in both magazines and other Wells' anthologies. Most of the stories are science fiction, though a few are not. Among my favorites were ""The Stolen Bacillus,"" ""The Lord of the Dynamos,"" ""Under the Knife,"" ""The Sea Raiders,"" ""The Crystal Egg,"" ""The Man Who Could Work Miracles,"" ""The New Accelerator,"" ""The Truth About Pyecraft,"" ""The Magic Shop,"" ""Empire of the Ants,"" and ""Country of the Blind."" ""The Crystal Egg"" and ""The Magic Shop"" both appear to have influenced Stephen King's NEEDFUL THINGS. Other stories were uninspired sleepers."
2,Disapointed,"This was not as pictured. The picture is of the one piece unit with a ""male"" connector. I was looking for the pictures model as my surgical supply store said the item was not available by their distributor. What I received was difficult to connect to the lower leg bag and was also much less comfortable than the unit I wanted...the picture lies!"
1,Not very giant of paper at all,"The product lists itself as a giant paper pad, but there's nothing giant about it. It's a standard 11 x 14, but not large enough for floor projects. I purchased a Giant paper pad at toys r us instead."
4,so musical a discord,"I enjoy this CD of compositions by Mrrs Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn. The title, ""Such Sweet Thunder"" is derived from a line in Shakespears' Midsummer Night's Dream and sets the stage for a work based upon the playwright's characters. All of the songs are captivating. I like the sultry stride of the title cut in which the trumpet of Mr Ray Nance makes me quiver with joy. A bit of ragtime is noticeable to me in ""Lady Mac"" in which the solos of Mrrs Russell Porcope and Clark Terry err only in being too short. I am impressed with the way the band comes together on ""Up and Down..."". The notes are from the original liner by Mr Irving Townsend. He annotates each song briefly, and provides background to the motivation for this unique blend of English Drama and American Jazz. It you are interested in the music of Mr Duke Ellington, or in the sound of Jazz Music played by an orchestra, this CD will interest you."
3,Such Sweet Music,"This album by Duke Ellington, was quite amazing. Duke's extensive knowledge of the big band and how it functions harmonically is quite breathtaking. This album shows how amazing jazz music can be if done properly."
4,Hildegard Von Bingen: Saints,Unfortunatelly I did not receive the book yet. The number in my house address at Amazon was reported wrongly. Now it is corrected.
3,Dictionary A to Z,"This is not the most comprehensive dictionary on earth's mysteries and sacred sites, Mainly focusing on the British Iles. However, it is pretty good referrence for those that need a starting point or for those that want to understand some of the language inferances and symbols of Neo-Pagans and Earth-Based Religions."
5,Absolutely love this book,Very easy read and so informative .i preaching out of 1peter right now and this book has really helped me by keeping things in context .knowing the culture is so very important because apart from that knowledge you will be preaching things that are simply not true. One small example is many believe that it was Rome who persecuted the Christians . Actually that's a yes and no . During the time the scriptures of the New Testament were written Rome really could have cared less about Christians . The persecuted were such mainly by Jews not Rome . Rome did not go rounding up Christians in a way that most of us have been taught . With that said Rome would kill a Christian unless they repented and offered a sacrifice . To see how this all happened you really need to gt this book . Plus the information about the emperors are amazing . I really can't say enough good about this book .
2,Poor dates recorded on Kindle version,I am curently reading this book for a class. The dates are wrong. The kindle version has BC when it should be AD. It will have the century then confusing with the date. Book version is much better.
5,new testament world,Albert bell has created a true work of study for any disciple who desires to learn the truth of the Bible. I am greatly please and service was excellent
2,Not What I Expected,"Gun in hand, formula of flesh and bury me were 3 excellent songs but the rest of the tracks on the album just sounded like filler. not really my kind of stuff i guess."
3,what happened?,"The Fire Whispers from the video sounds better than the one here, this version sounds incomplete like alot of the songs except gun in hand. I also heard a version of Dead Eyes with different lyrics that goes: ""dead eyes will warn you!"" which also sounded better and more finished than the new one. Where can I download these tracks? Anyway, on And We Are Bled of Color sounds kind of cluttered to where it's instrumental rather than a heartfelt passionate expression of emotion."
2,This CD is nothing new or exciting at all,"Kudos to these guys for getting a chance to do something big, but the music itself is actually quite boring.There is nothing on this CD that hasn't already been done by bands who have more experience, like Funeral For A Friend."
3,New Roots,"Stutterfly had an indie record, which recieved much credit. The biggest song of their indie record was ""Gun in Hand"". I was excited when I knew Stutterfly was signed to a lable. Now that the new cd is out... I'm not so excited. The single ""Gun in Hand"" has been totally redone and is 5 times softer. The screams are all faded out into the background. If you were a Stutterfly fan before you won't be happy in the least, if you're new to their music it won't bother you so much. I was dissapointed."
2,its....half assed?,"hmmm i like screamo and all but ive heard these songs before. its another example of a major label exploiting a samll town band in a desperate attempt at finding the next big thing, and who would have known, the big label has yet again screwed another young band. its a real shame."
1,It bad acid for the head,"First song is ok, but the rest gets worse and worse. When I listened to the album the 2nd time, I got the feeling the 3rd time may actually have the album ""poor toxic waste"" on my brain. Though this was released in the mid '80s, this is NOT sound anything like real '80s music. It's an exaggeration of the late '60s and '70s."
1,NO MANUAL,"I am taking this back tomorrow. You spend $50 and they can't even supply you with a printed manual! You have to go out to the web and download the manual. They do give you a 'quick card' for quick installation, but nothing else.I purchased this after reading all the reviews for this and other like programs listed on Amazon. I am attempting to replace Norton, which I am very unhappy with since it let viruses in for the second time in two months on our other computer. So it's back to the drawing board for me."
1,Another rebate scam,"I agree the product works. However would you be happy with your car mechanic who did a good job changing your oil, charged you retail, then followed you home and mugged you for $25? I've waited 10 weeks for the rebate and just found out (no they never called) they claim something was missing from the package I sent which included an old CD rom, UPC, reciepts, etc. I say BS. I am ever so careful to send exactly what companies request for rebate yet continue to gleefully get scammed. Not this time. I'm taking them to small claims to get my @#%& 25 dollars. If you care whether or not a company does honest business regardless the quality of their product, then think twice about this company. The product may work, but they are just another rebate scam artist as far as I have experienced."
3,Great but eats up memory terribly,"I have just upgraded from 2005 (which I loved) to 2006 with a clean install of 2006 to avoid problems. Read the manual, did everything correctly. It installed just fine. The 2nd day I am unable to open more than one large application at a time, such as Outlook and Firefox both at once. It eats up more memory than both of these apps together. My task manager says it is using 69,692 mg of memory just to run in background. I may have to turn off real time scanning to remedy this. What is the use of having the suite then? I have a Dell P4 with 756mg of memory. It has always been adequate to multitask before this. I may have to dump this 2006 anti-virus for another program. Even AVG and free zone alarm would eat up 1/2 of the memory as this. I guess you have to sacrifice safety for memory and the ability to multitask since I use my computer for work. Unless you want to upgrade your memory a lot, I wouldm't recommend this."
1,Poor Tech Support and poor function,Software loaded but could not update itself nor register with Trend Micro. The website was minimal help. Tech support took a full week to respond to first email request for help and then asked to repeat my problem. A second week went by with solutions that did not work. I ended up removing the software and installed a competitor's software. One star rating is generous.
1,"Trouble, time wasted, and poor support.",I have used previous versions of Trend Micro products for 2 years and bought the 2006 version instead of just renewing old license. I run XP Pro. Everything has slowed down including their own system scan which now runs all night and takes over 11 hours to reveal NO INFECTIONS FOUND! Searching for program conflicts is time consuming and unproductive so far. I'm uninstalling. I don't recommend.
2,A CPU hog,"I have a notebook with a 1.6Ghz Pentium M and I downloaded the trial to check it out on my new re-installed XP and I am happy that I did. It is eating up all my CPU power up to 100% when loading pages like this, I noticed because the webpages loaded so slow.For the technical people, it is the tmpfw.exe that uses all the cpu power.I have used it for 3 days, and I am going to try something else. Too bad because I had been using the 2005 version on my desktop PC which is a 3.2GHz so I might not have noticed if it used much CPU power.The high CPU usage also caused my notebook to eat through my battery after 1 hours surfing. I can normally get 4 hours from it when I have disabled the speakers and have the screen light on less than full power..All I will say to you, is download the trial first. and if you like it, buy it. But do yourself a favour and try it first.I give it 2 stars because I really liked the software before I tried it on my notebook. But sadly it is mostly useless for me."
1,Trend's Customer Service scores ZERO!,"I had the 2005 version, which expired. I spent 72 hours, 40 phone calls, and unnumerable emails trying to get my subscription to renew.My email went unanswered (for 3 weeks).My calls were routed to people in Pakistan, who were only setup for technical help, not order fullfillment.My complaints were ignored.Buy this product if you only need a year of protection and don't plan on requiring ANY help, or if you just get a kick out of talking to a Pakistani.Otherwise, steer clear of this one. The company's focus is on getting your $29.99, not on keeping you as a happy customer.Doubt it? Email alin_liu@trend.com.tw, the CEO's assistant, and ask them."
2,2006 Version now as flawed as Norton,"After years of sticking with the Norton family of products and their enormous drain on system resources, I made the switch to PC-Cillin with their 2005 version and removed every trace of Norton. I was extremely impressed--it was finding things that Norton didn't, and my computer was running faster than I'd ever seen before.When my year of updates ran out, I eagerly upgraded to the 2006 version. I was impressed with the great new features and sharp improved interface. Unfortunately, I also noticed an instant drop in the speed of my system. Everything--not just internet--is now at a crawl. It freezes up at least once a day. Looks like I'll have to find a new brand for my antivirus/internet software next year."
2,not good enough,"PC-Cillin found plenty of stuff when my computer was infected, but AVG anit-virus from Grisoft (freeware) was far more complete in its cleaning capabilities."
5,Great product; great support,"I spent over an hour uninstalling Norton and only a few minutes installing PC-Cillin IS 2006. PC-Cillin is much more efficient than Norton (faster scans, less resource drain, etc.). The only problem was the ""Direct"" connection option on the firewall prevented my connecting to the internet. I selected another option and submitted my case to Trend Micro. Within 24 hours, they provided me with a simple, workable solution that took less than two minutes to implement. My grown son and daughter are avid Trend Micro fans. Dad just joined them."
4,Good,"Decent protection, plays well with my PCs, no teck issues to speak of. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is their customer support and tech support people are idiots. Which is ok I guess because the product is realitively trouble free"
2,Terrible,"Terrible product, confusing, not easy to use like McAfee. Not meant for a basic computer user."
3,PC-cillin 2006,"First, I didn't know I was buying the ""old"" version until I saw it on your e-mail. It said 2006, so I assumed the version was current.Second, the PC-cillin box says ""Free Phone Support."" When I tried to get phone support, I was advised to go online, and no phone support was available. This is dishonest!!!Some problems with the product:it automatically dials in to the Internet, tying up our phone even when we're not home. This is not explained in the product literature or the tutorial. Also, I had to e-mail Trend Micro for help with viewing the turorial.That my opinion as of now, it may change after using the product for a longer time.Thanks."
1,Get Norton,I've been running PC-Cillin for close to a year now. I just picked up Norton the other day and discovered that I have three viruses on my computer. Thanks a lot PC-Cillin.
5,Cyber Security,"I had a trial period with this product, I was super pleased.I decided to buy it after expiration of trial. No complaints.JoAnn"
4,Think I made the right choice,"This is the first time I have ever used any security other than Norton. But with the all the unfavorable reviews on Norton decided it was time to change. My husband's new Dell computer came with PC-cillion installed, so thought that was a good recommendation and gave me a chance to see if I would like it before buying. Decided that I did like it and was easy to use. So ordered it and loaded without any problem and I have been able to successfully use it from the start. It is easy to use, doesn't have a couple of the shortcuts Norton has, like one click to identify addressed one wants blocked in their email, but other than that it is great. Works as fast as Norton and seems to do a better job without all the popups. If I can use it anyone can and I definately recommend it."
1,"Product may be good, but..................","Buyer beware. If you encounter a technical issue with this product and require a refund, you're out of luck. They will send you in endless circles attempting to get a product refund. There are many other good products out there that do the same thing. It's really easy to purchase, but impossible to get a refund!"
5,Works well!,"I've used TrendMicro since it came with my laptop about 4 years ago and would never switch to McAfee or Norton. TrendMicro's software is easy on the RAM and doesn't slow the computer down like its competitors.I chose not to use this software's anti-spyware and firewall functions only because I'm satisifed with what Microsoft gives me. But, I'm glad it was so easy to turn it off -- again, unlike its competitors."
2,Internet Security,Wasn't what I really wanted but you came through and had this item. Nice to know that you have a great return policy. Thanks again.
2,This let a virus in,"beware this software let a virus in, and yes I updated every day. I changed to windows one."
4,"Satisfied customer, more or less","As a former Norton user, I found PC-Cillin Internet Security easy to install and generally easy to use. However, I do have one criticism. Because I am a frequent internet surfer, the scan identifies a large number of ""cookies"" from sites I have visited. The list identifies the ""cookies"" by numerical code, requiring me to click individually on each one to identify the source. Then, instead of allowing me to save as approved the few connected to sites I frequently visit and delete the rest with one or two clicks, I am forced to identify and delete each one individually. What a waste of time!"
1,They owe me $120 - never paid,They shipped the wrong size and wrong color. I sent both boots back and never got a refund. They owe me $120. Amazon said I didn't resolve it according to their policy so they are absolved. I am upset - got no help from anyone.

4,Exhaustive,"The book is well written with an exhaustive list of references. However, while well written the book also paints a distorted picture of what is really going on in some of the ministries mentioned. Truths and valid arguments are intertwined with errors in scriptural interpretations on the part of the author. In certain places he pulls out sound bites and fails to give the who counsel on the subject presented. The reader should be well learned in scripture in order to properly digest the content of the book."
3,"Good Points, Long Read","I recently (or should I say, over a period of months) read Hank Hanegraaff's recent book Christianity in Crisis 21st Century. It is a book in which Hanegraaff exposes the falsities of Prosperity or ""Faith"" teaching. He points out many well known teachers of these practices and bring to light the trouble with their preachings (things that many overlook and may not know are contrary to what the Bible teaches). It is a book full of what seems to be well researched information.Hanegraaff is very straightforward and direct in his beliefs. He makes no attempt to make friends or sugar coat things. While I believe in the importance of truth and not covering up fallacies that can be detrimental to the faith of many, I think he might lose readers because of his approach. The length of the 427 page book might scare a few readers off as well. I do believe that many things in this book are well worth reading, I just think it could have been done in quite a few less pages."
4,Christians should pay attention to this book,"This book was a shocking revelation to me. I have not spent much time listening to many of the prosperity preachers on the Pink-Haired Lady Network, but their popularity is undeniable. What little bit of time I have spent listening to them usually ""sounds"" good. It is deceptive, but their constant asking for money to ""plant a seed"" always gave me concern, along with some of their claimed miracles. Many good people are being led astray by these people.The book is a bit dry at times and repetitive in places; otherwise, I would give it 5 stars. Nevertheless, it is definitely worth reading."
5,Christianity in Crisis 21st Century,It is an eye-opener. It challenges my faith. I need to be careful of false teachers
5,A shout out to the Church.,"This was an absolutely breathtaking book Hank Hanegraaff has written. I have seen the enormous effect of the Faith Movement in Tulsa, Ok. They say this is the heart of the Bible belt, well, it has definitely been corrupted. Thanks be to God that His light will shine through me. I am not going to let all these people continue to be decieved. Why should you? Read this book and watch with discernment, and present the truth to those that are in a whirlwind of deception. I strongly recommend all readers of my review to read this book. You will gain massive understanding of this movement and how fatal the effects are. I can almost guarantee you have already been exposed to this type of movement. I was, didn't even know it at all, and I thought I knew what discernment was. Those who trust in others information should always DIG to find the truth and real meaning of God's word. Love you all, Ray"
1,Study to show thyself approved...,"Mr Hanegraff has demonstrated a very critical summation of just about every minister that comes to mind. Each christian should study Gods word for themselves, and ask the Holy Spirit to do what Jesus said he would send it to do, teach us. Let's get off of Hanks ""SOUR"" milk, and get to the ""MEAT"" of Gods word with the LORDS instruction, insight, wisdom and GRACE. None of which Mr Hanegraff has demonstrated in this book, or his radio program, which I stopped listening to many years ago."
3,Informative but harsh,"This is an interesting book exploring the teachings of the Word of Faith Teachers. It looks at the people behind the doctrines and cites Benny Hinn, Kenneth Copeland, Hagin & Fred Price to name but a few. Hanegraffe delves into detail and does an excellent job doctrinally to disprove certain teachings.I would say however that he is somewhat harsh in his writing tone and one concern that I have is that one can become too careful in Pentecostal issues that they don't receive anything (only that which is genuine)."
1,"Critical spirit, maybe this guy would be more productive spending his time discipling","He is write about Kenyon, he was a nut. But hank bashes anything charsmatic, and the problem with that is there the only ones that experience revival.From what i have read of counterfeit revival his other book ,he belives that the devil heals people and delivers people from drugs.Thats garbage theology.If this guy meets jesus in heaven he would write a book.False Jesus.For revival check out my book on kindle,Revival Kings newsletter"
2,Book Review,"I did not enjoy this book, it was hard to get into, and i didn't finish. It may have just been me, or the time, but It was a hard read."
1,Christianity in Crisis - very dry,I tried reading this book. Quite a few times actually but I just couldn't get into it. I was very interested in hearing what Hanegraaff had to say because this is something that comes up in conversation at work a lot but his style of writing left me wanting more. I'm sure it has some good content in it somewhere but I just couldn't get into it.
5,Pertinent Information for all Christians,"Christianity in Crisis, 21st Century, by Hank Hanegraaff focuses heavily on the so called ""prosperity preachers.""Being familiar with most of those Hanegraaff examines in this scholarly book, I've watched and observed on TV at one time or another. In the beginning, some of these preachers were dynamic and actually focused on the Bible--but something happened as they gained popularity. They seemed to spin into a downward spiral.This book points out the many problem areas in these ""ministries"" including and most importantly, the way the Bible is misinterpreted to ""prove"" the erroneous points each of these preachers have used. Hanegraaff definitely shows how dangerous this kind of preaching is, and how it can lead believers astray.What I liked best is the way Hanegraaff ties things up in the last section called ""Back to Basics.""Marilyn Meredithhttp://fictionforyou.com"
4,Postcards from the Fringe,"The ""Bible Answer Man"" has written an update to his previous volume that exposes many popular fringe preachers. Most names will appear familiar to anyone who has done some channel surfing. The book is a who's who of disfunctional Christianity. The book is both helpful and discouraging. Most evangelical Christians try to maintain unity around the authority of Scripture and the Personal and Work of Christ, while agreeing to disagree on less vital doctrines. The problem is that there remains a lot of groups with cultic characteristics the rest of us might prefer to ignore. You wonder how anyone takes them seriously, but many do. So Hank has provided a service in explaining what sets these folk apart from the rest of Christianity. I would have added the 1611 KJV-only adherents, but I suppose most readers have a few ""isms"" they'd have liked addressed. Hank represents evangelical Christianity and gives a reasonable critique of fringe groups. We've been informed and warned."
5,Huge Eye-Opener!,"This book has been a huge eye-opener for me. I had never really paid much attention to the ""Faith"" movement until I read this book. It is filled with quotes from various ""Christian"" people, like Joyce Meyer, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, & John Hagee - to name a few, who have taken God's Word and made it fit their ""agenda"". It makes me sad to know that these ""leaders"" have misled so many innocent people. It's time for true Christians to stand up! I am glad I read this book. Every Christian should read it and tell others."
4,"Same Story, Different Names","The revamped version of Hank Hanegraaff's book Christianity in Crisis is a renewed warning to gullible Christians for the 21st century. Much of what is written is not new. The errors are the same ones we've been facing for several decades, but the names of many of the false prophets have changed. Also, there is a new generation of evangelicals who have not been properly grounded in the basics of the faith and so are susceptible to the disease of an anthropocentric and Christless Christianity which seeks wealth and comfort above truth.Hanegraaff is tough but biblical. He names names and reveals error, but does so without vitriol."
1,Old and In the Way!,I'm not sure the text has been updated since the original copyright in 1954. Certainly the current nutritional advice is at odds with much of what this simplistic book recommends. And it doesn't even mention exercise! Common sense tells me to take advantage of more recent scientific studies of arthritis.
3,Great Extras,"I think this is a alsome DVD for people that like music playing while they are doing there stunts etc no motorcycle sounds, I personally Much prefer listing to the sound of the motorbikes like in the extra's section of this DVD."
5,True gospel music,"These sisters are filled with the Holy Spirit. I stumbled upon their music via internet radio. The clear excellent singing coupled with great musical accomplishments truly uplifts the heart and points the listener back to the word of God, the Bible. Everyone who's heard me play these CDs (I have all three available) have really appreciated it. It is hard to find authentic gospel music nowadays. This is no fluff; it strengthens the heart and mind and helps to build character."
4,Be a player in the world to come,"At first glance Engines that Move Markets appears to be directed at investors. I would argue that this book is equally, if not more, valuable for entrepreneurs creating any venture aimed at somehow changing the world. After all, true entrepreneurs are by definition ""change advocates.""Technology has, is, and will continue to change the world around us. Engines That Move Markets explores the impact of some great technological inventions of the past two hundred years.Chronologically, Nairn explores the historical context of major innovations ranging from canals and railroads to the PC and the Internet.Do you want to know what the Next Big Thing will be? More importantly, do you want to be part of creating the future and the fortunes that will be created? If you do, this is the book for you. It will stimulate your mind in such a way as to let you be a player in the world to come, instead of a mere spectator.------------------Michael Davis, Editor - Byvation"
4,The Murder Room,Was hoping it was a movie of a play of the same name but it's not... still a good movie.
4,The Murder Room an external appreciation,"Super movie,great story & Samantha Bond is a knockout.Don't hesitate to get this;worth watchig over & over."
2,Bad choices for your soundtrack,"There are maybe three songs on this CD that I would listen to. I have watched the show occassionally and they have played some really good music before. They have played Barenaked Ladies more then once and a lot of other really good groups. Get a clue if you put a mixture of sounds like R&B, alternative, etc. you will sell more CD's and have happier customers."
3,Just a comment,"The Cd is cool. I like the songs ""Kiss Me"" and ""Home to Me"" especially, but I was wondering why there weren't more songs like ""Say Goodnight"", ""I'll Be"", or ""On My Own"" that are from key scenes and turning points in the show on the CD. All in all, I'd give the CD a 3."
3,A few good songs but not many better known ones heard on,"I like the songs on the CD but there are SOO many good songs that were left off. EDwin McCAin, Billy Miner, Jewel, etc. would have been better assets to this CD than the lesser known artists that do appear. For the Canadians who wanted ""On My Own"" that song is from the ""Les MIserable"" musical soundtrack. Try looking there."
1,Advertising for free,"It's a little bit suspicious that Columbia/Tri-Star distributes the television series and puts out a CD full of bands signed to the Columbia record label. This CD is a blatant excuse to promote a bunch of homogenized, sappy mall rock bands to teenagers who are spending mommy and daddy's money. Wait til you have kids and they ask to ""borrow"" $17 for this crap. What a waste of money. Don't be fooled. Go out and buy Sixpence's album if you like ""Kiss Me."" And all this comes from a HUGE Dawson's Creek fan."
2,I'm really dissapointed...... :-(,"I bought the cd and to my surprise the best songs weren't in it (I'll be, bareky breathing, out of my head, have a little faith in me.) I'm very dissapointed. Next time the recording label should ask the listener what they want to hear, instead of putting songs randomly."
4,Cool but could do better,"I really loved the cd, but I wish that maybe Edwin McCann was on it or Bille Myres with ""kiss the rain"", but other then that it is a cool cd."
3,I think that they missed a few...,"There were so many excellent songs from the first and second season of Dawson's Creek that they missed, especially a few that were fairly well-recognized. The most notable omission has to be Edwin McCain, and many other such as Marc Cohn, Tal Bachman, and John Hiatt. A bit disappointing -- I was looking forward to this CD, but doubt that I will purchase it."
3,Why no EDWIN McCAIN???,"You would think that when someone decided to put together a cd that is supposted to reflect a great show, that it would have some great songs on it.......which this one does. BUT it seems like it is missing a few songs that were played at pivot points during the show. Like ""I'll Be"" by Edwin McCain, that was played in the show when Dawson and Joey got together, or ""Kiss the Rain"" by ""Billie Myer that was played during the same show!!! Oh, well, at least Heather Nova made it on there!!!"
1,Where's Jann ?,"Where's the good songs ? Thought we'd get a ""soundtrack"" ( = sampler with songs appearing in the show) and not a mix of stuff nobody's interested in at all. And why the hell did they leave out Jann Arden's ""Elsewhere"", the greatest song I ever heard ? Do they want to sell that thing or not ? I think: not."
3,Right outta teen beat,"I should have known better than to give into this temptation. But Kiss me is on the radio... and I can stand it. I also like Chantal Kreviazuk, Sophie B. Hawkins and Paula Cole. I find it very appropriate to listen to while I'm at work. But when gummi bear Shooter comes on I have got to fast forward. I also find it a kind of drawback that there weren't any soundclips from the series on the CD."
5,One Great Soundtrack,I am one of those older people who watches the teenagers weekly. Every epsiode there was a song that played and stuck in my head. I was thrilled when they put them all together in this excellent soundtrack. It is a great variety of music!
2,Disapointed,"I was a little dispointed with this soundtrack. I mean, everyone goes on and on about how good it is but I just can't see it. I only like one song, Life's a B!tch. I'd say it was a waste of money. I shoulda saved it to buy something else."
5,The BEST Soundtrack!,"This is the BEST soundtrack! The best of all, is that you play many scences from the show in your mind when you listen to these songs!!!"
2,I am disappointed with the songs that were chosen.,"Dawson's Creek is my favorite show and there is always awesome music in every episode. However, the only good song on this CD is ""Kiss Me""...all the rest are songs that I have never heard of. Why couldn't all the good songs have been put on this CD? I have been awaiting the release of a soundtrack since the show began, but I don't think I am even going to buy this CD. I've never even heard of half the artists! :-("
3,good but not so amzing!,first of all i have to say i find the tv series fantastic! the soundtrack is not so bad 'cos there are some good song u'll love. but anyway i can't say it's one of the best cd i've ever heard..it's not true! in fact there are songs that are so boring ...i can't explain! and so this cd is good but not fantastic as u might expect i'm sure there is a masterpiece....''i don't want to wait''performed by paula cole is the best track in the album... 3 stars aren't so many but...nevermind! in the end:good but not amazing!
2,a bit too sentamental,"I think most of the music on here is pretty good by it's self, but together it's all way too depressing and sentimental."
3,Dawson's Decent But Not Breathtakin',"I'm definitely skeptical about this whole CD as it isn't so much a soundtrack as the Creek crew taking songs they like and putting them into episodes AFTER the fact, but still it's a decent compilation. Nova, Shooter, Wood, Hassman, all real good stuff. All of these female solo acts can sound alike though. And I was disappointed to find a pic of Dawson behind my CD...I sure do like that Katie Holmes."
4,I was very surprised at how good this CD really is.,"Before I bought this CD, I didn't think that it would be very good. I only liked a few songs on it, so I thought that I wouldn't get it. But then I thought, this is Dawson's Creek! It has to be a good soundtrack! So I bought it, and, with the exception of a few songs, I think it's an awesome CD. My favorites are ""Feels Like Home"" by Chantal Kreviazuk and ""Life's a Bitch"" by Shooter. Bye!"
4,"Pretty good, but missing a few.","Overall, I'm pleased with the CD. The songs are nice and mellow and the selection is pretty good as well. I do wish that a few songs such as ""I'll Be"" by Edwin McCain and ""Lover Lay Down"" by Dave Matthews Band were on it (although that one is pretty new). Even songs by Swirl 360 or the New Radicals would have added greatly to the variety. But, it's still great and worth the price (the pictures aren't bad either!:)"
3,can we contact the record company?,"I haven't bought the cd yet, but a lot of the songs on the show are not on there, and i was wondering if we can email to the record company and request some songs to be put on the next cd. I really want to hear ""on my own"", the song sang by joey in the episode ""pretty woman"". If any of you know how we can do this, write pls!"
3,Where's Jewel???,"I'm the biggest Dawson's Creek fanatic! I ran out and bought the CD the day it was released and listened to it straight through. Most of the songs were pretty good, but where the heck was Jewel's ""Hands""??? That and Edwin McCain's ""I'll Be"" were two of the shows best songs and weren't even on the soundtrack."
2,Songs From Dawson's Creek,"I always believed that if you were to call something a sound track, it should actually include material that actually WAS FEATURED in the show which it represents or at least capture the mood of the series. In my opinion this ""soundtrack"" fails to accomplish either.It seems like a ""put something out there and see if teenagers will buy it"" plan, that capitalizes on what people would see as adolesant ignorance. I hate that.So why did I give it two stars? Well, Sophie B. Hawkins has a pretty intellegent song featured on it. Also, Chantal Kreviazuk is a gifted singer/songwriter and anything with her in it can't be all bad. Even if she didn't actually write ""Feels Like Home"" she sings it with a passion that is laking in the other tracks. I was wondering what either of these artists were doing in this line-up.That's only the second and third tracks, it's all mind-numbingly downhill from there."
1,Ew Ew Ew - What a Waste!,"When I first found out that Dawson's Creek was releasing a soundtrack I was estatic. Finally all my favorite songs from DC compiled on one CD. Boy was I wrong. They totally forgot about all the awesome songs from the first season and even from this one. ""Say Goodnight"" Beth Nielsen Chapman, ""Broken Road"" Melodie Crittenden, ""I'll Be"" Edwin McCain, ""Kiss the Rain"" Billie Myers, ""I'll Remember You"" Sophie Zelmani,""Have A Little Faith In Me"" John Hiatt. I could go on forever with all the awesome songs that they left out. I am arguably the biggest DC fan and was very disappointed with the turnout of this CD. It is just a shameless plug. One of the very few good songs on it is ""Kiss Me"" but that song has already been played out and if you really wanted the song I suggest getting the ""She's All That"" soundtrack or Sixpence None The Richer. The only song I can tolerate is ""Life's a Bitch"" Shooter. Overall I say it's a waste of money."
3,It was good...,"Well... what can I say? I have never been extremely impressed with sound tracks from a tv show... but this cd is definetly worth a listen. Shawn Mullins ""Shimmer"", and Chantal Kreviazuk's ""Feels like home"" are superior over the rest, but all in all not a bad cd."
5,Creek Your Collection Out!,More great songs from this AMAZING show! Reflects the 90's sensibility and youth that was SO important to this show. Great Soundtrack!!
5,This is a wonderful soundtrack!!!,"At first, I was skeptical about buying this CD because I had not heard of many of the songs, but once I bought it and listened to it, I loved it! Even if you can't pick out the episode that some of the songs were on, each one reminds you of a moment or a character. I would recommend this CD to any Dawson's Creek fan!"
4,"Dawson's Creek ""Kiss Me"" & ""Did You Ever Love Somebody""",Amazingly dynamite CD. The best songs are by Jessica Simpson and Sixpence None The Richer. Go buy the CD now. There are some other super songs from our favorite show.
2,Disappointing,"There were a few good songs including London Rain, I Don't Want To Wait, and Kiss Me, and the rest were mediocre. If you're expecting recognizable music from the show, you're in for a huge disappointment, but the music itself isn't terrible, just nothing that stands out."
4,A good soundtrack,"I think it's a good soundtrack, except that most of the songs on it are kinda sappy. My favorite is ""Feels Like Home"" because it sums up the way a lot of us feel about a true love, or wanting one."
3,It's a good cd,"It sounds like a good cd I just wish it would of had the songs ""She's the One,""Billie Myers ""Kiss the Rain""and Edwin McCain's""I'll be""but I do like the song""Kiss Me""by Sixpence None the Richer and the song ""I don't want to wait""by Paula Cole so I guess other than the fact that it is missing those songs it is a good cd."
3,What r they smoking???,I was really dissapointed with this cd!I don't understand how they could miss so many of the key songs that the show is really about! I mean half of thease songs Ive never heard of! And Dawsons Creek is my absolute favorit show in the world. I think they should come out with another Cd and put in the songs that people want to hear!
2,I was suprised that the songs from key moments were gone.,"I really was suprised that my favorite songs from the key moments of the show were missing. Like ""Kiss the rain"" by Billie Myers when Dawson and Joey make up, and ""Say goodnight"" by Beth Neilsen Chapman at the end of season 1 when Dawson and Joey kiss. Overall I had not heard of 80% of the songs on the cd. Even though I am a hardcore show fanatic, I opted not to buy the so-called ""soundtrack"" Scott Engle, 14 Belleville, KS"
2,OVERRATED!,"I LOVE Dawson's Creek, but this soundtrack was disappointing to me. It seems to be more of a plug for new songs than any representation of memorable songs from the show. What about Meredith Brooks' ""What would happen if we kissed"" from the episode of Dawson's first kiss and Pacey's experience with Miss Jacobs or Jann Arden's ""You don't know me"" from when Joey was pining over Dawson? Even ""Tubthumping"" could have been included from when Pacey walked into class and Miss Jacobs was his English Teacher? Those great songs from the first season were excluded to make room for plugging new artists. Sure, they played ""Kiss Me"" on the episode when Joey and Dawson finally kissed again and they included the theme song, but just as I was afraid of, this album is a plug and not much more. It makes me sad because I absolutely LOVE the show, but I could make a tape of better songs than this to represent the show. It is unfortunately OVERRATED."
2,Not as good as it could have been.,"When I heard there was a 'Dawson's Creek' soundtrack to be released, I was excited. Then I got the CD as my excitement vanished. The CD, apart from a few high points (Sixpence None the Richer, Shooter and Shawn Mullins) is flat, with little difference between the styles of the songs picked. There is such a huge amount of great music used in the series that you would expect the soundtrack to sound better, but it fails to deliver."
3,Where's Edwin McCain?,"I would have rated this 5 stars if it had included I'LL BE which captured Joey and Dawson's relationship perfectly. The other songs are good, makes you think of the episodes in which they were featured and the carefree spirit of adolescence. If you enjoy the show, this CD is a good collection of the songs that help make it such a teen hit today."
3,Like the idea...,"One of the reasons I watch Dawson's Creek is because it always has some GOOD music in the background... I love the fact that they made a soundtrack... Any Lucky Penny is a great song! Sophie rocks, too... The ONLY song I pass up on this CD is Paula Cole... can we say PLAYED OUT! Other than that song, the soundtrack is fabulous and I recommend it!"
4,A Great CD Which Compliments The Show Nicely,"This long awaited album features a good selection od songs from the TV series Dawsons Creek. The mood and style of the music captures the feel of the show. This album steers clear of the more well known bands and opts to provide the listener with newcomers, much like the show. Although the CD is good, I think it is a shame that (speaking from a UK point of view) the international theme from the first series wasn't included, and that some of the bigger songs that have appeared on the show (Tubthumping, for example) were not included on the album. However, besides a few minor complaints, fans of Dawson's Creek will most likely love this CD"
5,"A fine, touching selection of music from the brilliant...","drama series! It subtly captures many of the themes and emotions from the show and immortalizes them on CD. Followers of {Dawson's Creek} will love the album -it brings back alive tender, memorable scenes and events in the lives of Dawson, Joey, Jen, and Pacey. Personally, I cannot pick out any specially favourite tracks. They're all precious; each song is so full of feeling; and they all have themes relevant and appealing to the target audience. Each tell a tale of an experience that all of us can all relate to. Although it doesn't include some songs I felt should've been, I'm quite happy with the album as it is. Even if you don't watch {Dawson's Creek}, it is worth a listen. Certainly, I'm looking forward to future compilations form the TV show!"
4,A not for all teens quiet albulm that is easy to relate to,With songs like 'Life's a bitch'and 'Cry Ophelia' this album is easy to relate to. Most of the songs voice a time of uncertainty that everyone has experienced. It has that kind of soft but powerful effect that makes you want to listen ot it over and over. The slow somewhat quiet tracks mightn't be to every teenagers liking but it was to mine!
5,Excellent book on the topic,"The history of psychosurgery is intriguing to anyone interested in the brain, and it begs two questions (1) How did it happen that surgeons once found it fashionable and helpful to cut the frontal lobes, and (2) What do we know now about those ailments that were once treated by psychosurgery? Valenstein's book provides a comprehensive historical review that answers the first question, and provides important cues to answer the second, including some of the current views on brain and mood disorders. Valenstein's personal biases against some of these theories do not show through, and he maintains an even perspective. The sciences is treated seriously but remains accessible. Background information on the various figures involved in psychosurgery are also provided when needed, but never turn into annoying biopics. I really enjoyed reading it."
4,Contemplation,"This little book is nice to have for little snippets into the mind of Beethoven. There are several biographies of the great artist; but this little book provides Beethoven's writings on things like God, Nature, Art, etc. that give the reader things to consider. It's great to pick up for an inspiration, light reading, or even daily thought."
4,Amazing Story of What Love Can Do,"Yes, the two main people in this memoir are self-indulgent, but there is one, and only one, thread that holds them together: Love. It cannot be sexual attraction, because one is gay and one is straight. And the thread of love holds and holds and holds and finally snaps. Marion Winik's writing held me from the first chapter to the last and never snapped."
3,No Longer a Fan,"I'm sorry. I'm aware of all the favorable comments regarding this book, and no one should question Marion Winik's writing abilities -- ""First Comes Love"" is a well crafted book -- but, being that it is a memoir, I must confess that I no longer like or respect her as a person. This is not a love story -- it is an expose of a woman who decides she is going to have what she wants, regardless of anyone else's needs. Neither do I see her as someone I should admire for courage or long suffering. Sure, she finally decides to care for him as he dies. That is the least that she should do, as far as I'm concerned. She robbed him if the rest of his life."
2,just okay,"I somehow thought this was going to be a body sculpting DVD, not a group class taught by an Aussie. Which is fine, it's just not what I thought I was going to receive. Also, it's kind of lame and low impact, but they do all do it (the class, which has varied people in it) I just don't know how much it does in terms of burning calories, etc."
2,Dissapointing Cash In Single,"I adore Ms Lear and have to have everything she does, hence my purchasing this single, also the promise of a 'music video' to her hit single Love Boat from her 2001 CD 'Heart' was tempting. Well firstly the remix of 'Copacabana' is so bad it seems like it was a rush job in an amateur studio and ruins what is actually a very good cover of the Manilow classic (the original can be found on the excellent compilation CD Forever Glam, another track from Heart 'Do you wanna see it' is included as well. As for the so called 'video' it is a television clip of the beautiful Lear performing the song for some European television show. Forget this dissapointing cash-in single and save your money for one of Amanda's excellent CD's or the new track 'Paris By Night'."
5,Great Film. Daniel Day Lewis at his best,"A great film of perseverance. Academy Award winner Daniel Day Lewis and Brenda Fricker were terrific. Wonderful acting. At times, it was hard to understand the hard accents."
5,A Religious Experience,"Mahalia Jackson's contribution to this recording is simply too beautiful for words. It is faith restoring. Her partnership with the great Duke Ellington as well as her solo version of ""Come Sunday"" should be heard by all people of faith regardless of their faith."
5,The Yogi Bear Show,The kids and I love it. Now I can share a blast from my childhood with my kids and they absolutely love it.
3,"""The Yogi Bear Show - The Complete Series""","I will get straight to point. If you are a huge Yogi Bear fan then you are definitely going to love this DVD set. However, I am personally disgusted by how little time, effort, and money went into packaging this 4 DVD set. Seriously, a toddler could design a better case. When a company charges this much, the very least they can do is design a simple case where the DVD's can be accessed without having to remove another DVD and play the ""I need 4 hands to juggle everything"" game. How much more would it actually cost to have a case with a degree of quality?"
2,Somewhat Dissapointed In Yogi,Im somewhat dissapointed in Yogi Show simply because there isnt enough yogi! They show snagglepuss and yankee doodle as well. I much enjoy Yogi more than them and have always tedisome to have to change it when they come on after Yogi.Its Decent But If Your Like Me Then Dont Approve-Steveo
1,UNHAPPY PURCHASER,"THIS ITEAM IS DEFECTIVE, WHILE VIEWWING THIS DVD, IN THE PLAYING MODE, THE DVD WOULD GET STUCK,( FREEZE MODE ) THEN, CONTINUE TO PLAY THEN GET STUCK AGAIN, ( FREEZE MODE ) THEN CONTINUE TO PLAY AGAIN, AND GET STUCK, AGAIN, AND AGAIN, THEN PLAY GOOD, AND I KNOW IT ISN'T THE DVD/VCR MACHINE, BECAUSE ITS A BRAND NEW SONY I JUST GOT LAST WEEK. THIS DVD SET IS MISSING THE OPENNING CREDITS THEME SONGS, AND THE CLOSING CREDITS THEME SONGS, OF EVERY EPISODA WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE PUT ON EVERY EPISODA . AND FINALLY IS MISSING THE INTERDUCTION, OF THE OTHER CARTOONS SHOWS THAT WAS LINE UP , FOR EACH EPISODA . THIS ONE IS BEING RETURN BACK TO AMAZON"
3,Yogi Bear,"While the cartoons were enjoyable, I must say I am truly dissappointed. This was not a series they reproduced, it wasn't even an entire show. It was merely a few cartoons put together. I must state my extreme dissappointment in this. And, the title is so mis-leading. ""The complete"" is hardly complete......"
2,Yogi Bear DVD not as expected,The Yogi Bear DVD we pirchsed wasn't what we expected. We really weren't looking for the other cartoons in the shows. We wanted strictly the entire file of Yogi Bear. We were disappointed to see the reat.
4,Enjoyable Yogi,"We bought this set for our 3 year old daughter. She thoroughly enjoys it. She is very picky. She only watches the traditional cartoons, not the computer animated. We have watched a few of the episodes with her and enjoy them also. It does have other cartoons with it (Yakky doodle and Snagglepuss). She likes those also. I just wish it had the holiday Yogi's that I enjoyed."
1,Not satisfied,"I felt like I was tricked when buying this dvd. It says the complete series but it's only disc 1 of 4. How would I know how many discs there are suppose to be. Not to mention, I wasn't sent a backing slip so that I could return it."
3,Just O.K.,"This product looked good and was a good price, but the first time someone sat on it, the seat cracked. I also paid for 2 day delivery and it came 5 days later. It was such a hassle to get reimbursed for the shipping difference (I got it through Amazon) that I just gave up. The company did replace the seat, and the 2nd seat was fine, but they wanted to charge for the seat replacement(after some discussion, they conceded and did not charge for the seat, but did charge shipping). Overall, after all the hassles, the product is o.k. for the price."
1,caregiver,"Don't bother to buy. This ""chair"" is so uncomfortable I would not ask anyone to sit in it, even for a brief shower."
4,Sturdy and well made,"Excellent brakes. Allows us to roll the patient right into the shower, safely and quickly. Assembly was easy, I would recommend this chair to anyone"
3,More magician instruction manual than enjoyable reading,"This book basically shows the secrets behind Houdini's tricks. If you ever watched a special on TV about magician's tricks, then there's no surprise here. Not very entertaining; more along the lines of a ""how to"" book."
2,The book hardly covered the base as it was in the 1950s. I think it should have included pictures of Dealy Hall where sailors hu,Should have included Dealy Hall where sailors hung out in the cafateria and the old White Hat club as they were in the 1950s. Book was greaat on history but little of what the base looks like. I served there in the 1950s and 1960s.
3,WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE RATING THIS DOPE ALBUM?,"I got this CD off of [website]. I'd not sorry I did.'LUNE TUNZ' (pronounced LOONEY) has hip-hop beats over rough and rugged lyrics but also cartoon sound effects which makes this album kinda interesting. I can't find mine right now,I believe there are 13 tunes to listen to,all of then BANG. They sound like ONYX meets YOUNG BLACK TEENAGERS. ""How Many Lumps?"" you want of this?!!"
5,Love it,"Good size, good price and it looks to pretty among some of my crystals. I am very happy I bought it."
4,GREAT BALL TEENIE STAND THOUGH,"THIS WAS AN IMPULSE BUY. NEVER SHOP WHEN MELANCHOLY. KIND OF REGRET BUYING THIS. 60% GLASS AND 40% CRYSTAL. I FOUND ONE FOR $2 MORE ON AMAZON AND IT IS 100% QUARTZ NO LEADED GLASS. ANYWAY THERE ARE NO DEFECTS, IT IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE MY HUSBAND PICKED IT UP 3 TIMES LOL COURSE SOMETHING THAT BIG SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING INSIDE TO LOOK AT HE SAYS. THAT JUST MADE ME FEEL DUMB FOR BUYING IT. ANYWAY JUST MAKES ME WONDER WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN LOL HAD I WAITED A LITTLE LONGER AND FOR JUST 2 BUCKS MORE. WELL,I MAY BUY ANOTHER STAND. THE ONE IT COMES WITH IS NOT VERY SECURE. IT HAS AN INDENTATION OF A CIRCLE BUT IF YOU SHAKE THE TABLE IT WILL ROLL OFF. I LIKE THAT IT WAS PACKED VERY WELL. BRAVO!"
5,"Great Ball, Wobbly Stand","This is a gorgeous crystal ball. I absolutely love it. The only problem is the stand is quite wobbly and the ball basically rolls off if anyone walks by. I decided to purchase a bronze stand separately for this crystal ball that ended up costing more than the actual crystall ball; I think I spent aout $60 on the ball and the stand together. But it looks so much better on the bronze stand and is stable, too. If I were to purchase another crystal ball I might look into the stand it came with more. I have seen some crystal balls displayed on little pillows made of velvet which is very attractive and probably less expensive than a bronze stand but I could not find a pillow I liked (and didn't want to make one). Also the box it came in it somewhat warped. Still I give the crystal ball 5 stars. I ordered the ball and do not care about the stand or the box enough to remove a star from my rating."
2,Maybe it's just me.,"Maybe I'm just one for modern hardcore hip hop beats like ""Tech N9ne - EBAH"" ""Boondox - Death of a Hater"" ""Project Deadman - Body Bag"" ""Stevie Stone - Mosh"" and many others, but I can't get into Blaze's beats. Maybe it's because I listen to a little mainstream rock and almost solely underground hip hop and underground metal. I do love a good hard beat that sounds sinister, but I absolutely love Blaze's vocals and flows. He is the best vocalist on Psychopathic, but I think Boondox is the best overall besides possibly Twiztid."
5,Never thought I'd see the day......,"I caught this one when it was first broadcast on Showtime 327 years ago..and have only a 15th generation bootleg vhs dub to remember it by.I never,ever thought it would make it to DVD..being a long forgotten concert by an artist whom critics have always loved to hate,and who hasn't had anything in the top ten in more than a decade...This is a pleasant surprise indeed! His rabid and loyal fanbase will gobble this up in record time,So I won't preach to the choir....If you are a passive fan or just want to enjoy a great show from a great performer,dust off your parachute pants and pre-order this gem!...Now,if I could just score that KISS concert that HBO aired in '79............."
3,For Hardcore Fans Only,"As has been stated by another reviewer, the sound quality is lacking on this dvd. Whoever did the mastering made a poor attempt to ensure the sound and video were in-sync. DO NOT attempt to listen/watch this in 5.1 - it's maddening! At first I thought Rick WAS lip-synching! And the lack of audible crowd noise was disturbing. Listening to the stereo version helps with the audio-sync problems, but doesn't cure it completely. Unless you can overlook these serious problems, DON'T buy this, and DON'T pay full price!"
5,Great Artist Cheap DVD,This DVD is so cheap the description on the back cover is copied straight from Wikipedia and some of that language I put on wikipedia myself. So you can imagine how strange it was to look at the back of this DVD in the store and read the exact same words I composed. There are also typos.
5,Kickin' Rick,I first watched this concert in 1982. It was and still is the best concert I ever saw. So much energy so many great songs and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Rick Springfield.
1,What a bummer,"I love "" I WON'T WORRY "" and listen to it often. I thought I needed more of this and ordered this CD. Were the previous cd is a cool mix of SRV / DICK DALE and the SHADOWS, this is a horrid mix of MERV AND THE MAGIC TONES and the SHADOWS. No BLUES anywhere to be found, dumb lyrics, horrid songs and he even seems to have lost the abillity to play the guitar.Absolutely nothing of interest here if you are a guitar nut like me. Buy ""I WON'T WORRY"" and enjoy this mans immense talent, but stay clear of this offering. I am not sure what happened here, but it is a huge dissapointment."
2,Hamish Macbeth-Series One,"This CD is disappointing. I expected murder mysteries written by M.C. Beaton. They aren't. They're just stories written by others. There are characters in these episodes that were not created by Beaton and there are some of Beaton's characters that are not at all like the originals. Some of the Scottish accents are so thik I found dialogue difficult, sometimes impossible, to understand.Richard"
3,Depends on one's taste,"This is neither a detective series nor a comedy. It's an odd mixture of the two, with a dash of soap opera, featuring a lot of Scottish scenery and a handful of characters who inhabit a single community somewhere north of Inverness. The hero is a policeman who is very human, and even breaks the law to protect his friends and defend his manhood. (An outsider mocks his name, so Hamish--twice--kicks in the headlights of the man's expensive car. Then, at about 125 pounds, he thrashes the larger bad guy.) Other characters in the series are only mildly entertaining when intelligible; some of their dialogue is lost thanks to heavy Scottish accents. The first two episodes are especially weak. The last two are quite good, the best being ""Wee Jock's Lament."" So, it's a matter of taste. People seeking gentle dialogue and local color will no doubt enjoy this much more than those who prefer A Taste of Frost and Fawlty Towers."
5,Absolutely terrific.,"This is a series I watched, rewatched and rewatched. I love this series so much I now desire to travel to Scotland and see this beautiful place."
2,Disappointing,I am a big fan of the Hamish Macbeth murder mysteries and was expecting something even a little like the books.One of MC Beaton's books has a character who is a murder mystery writer very disappointed with the filming of her works. I wonder if this is where she got the idea.
3,Hamish Macbeth - Series One,"I love M.C. Beaton's Character Hamish Macbeth and so was thrilled to hear that there was a BBC series that featured his character. I did enjoy watching the series and would order another season if it was available. But I was disappointed that these stories seemed to be more superficial than those in the book and the characters seemed more stereotypical and less interesting. I am hopeful that it is just taking some time to develop this series and by the time the 2nd season is available, I'll recognize all those characters that make Beaton's books so fun to read!"
5,Lorrie Morgan Christmas in London,Strong voice with great songs. There are a couple of songs that only Lorrie herself can sing. One of my favorite Christmas CD's.
3,Just so-so,"While the protagonist, Ben Kincaid, is quite likable, the plot as well as some of the other characters in the book are a bit out there. I don't want to give details of the story, but to me many of those twists and turns seemed to have been introduced by the author for the sole purpose of bringing the plot to a conclusion - without much regard for logic or probability. The result was that many of the characters appear to be almost cartoon-ish and that kept interfering with the thriller aspect of the story, i.e. suspense was hard to come by.It was not the worst book I ever read by a long shot, but I will probably not buy more by this author. As someone who loves well-written thrillers with good and credible plots, this one was lacking a bit too much in that area."
4,Blind Justice,This book kept my interest and I wanted to read the next chapter to see what was going to happen. This is a good mystery and loaded with humor which makes it even better.
1,Underwhelming,"I don't even remember why Brazilian Duos was recommended to me here on amazon. Perhaps it is because I enjoy Bonfa, Deodato, Gilberto, Gismonti, Nogueira and some other Brazilian musicians that amazon's computer decided I would probably like this as well. I don't.I bought this several years ago and listened three or four times before deciding to shelve it. Then recently, I listened again hoping to find something I missed. I didn't. It remains underwhelming. There is nothing special in her voice, in the music, or in the arrangements. Despite that I am more than willing to try something new, I just can't find anything on this CD that inspires me. I'm not saying its bad music, I'd rather listen to this than a lot of other music that's out there. All I am saying is that it doesn't speak to me!Perhaps there are other Luciana Souza albums that I would like more, but after my experience with Brazilian Duos, I would have to hear them before buying."
5,I remember this well!,"I remember loving this book as a girl. It was one of my favorite library finds!I'm looking forward to reading it again, and passing it down to my daughters."
3,Stirred memories,"I got this for a lovely niece. Now out of print, on-line searching turned up this copy. ""Good"" turned out a bit more ""fair"" than I had hoped for a gift, but the book is old, so I perhaps should have expected yellowed, brittle pages. The story still is lovely."
1,The phographs are nice,"But there just really isn't any substance to this book. The projects are very simplistic, so in that regard I suppose this might be a nice project book for a beginning collage/assemblage enthusiast, but if you have any experience, this book isn't for you. It does have some nice photographs of vintage ephemera, which I plan to cut out of the book and use in my projects, but for me, that is about all this book is good for."
2,for timorous housewifes,"the real coverbook is different from that you can see on the AMAZON's page!!!this is a very bad thing 'cause if I had seen it before, I'll never chose it.the contents are mawkish and impersonal, often banal.the explanations are insufficient and vague.he is right for timorous housewifes."
5,If you like great music in small packages....,"Firstoff I have to express my obsession for Goldfrapp, and as you know, they scored this film. However, THEIR SCORE IS VERY, VERY SHORT on the album-DO NOT BE FOOLED-but if you are a fan like me, it is definitely worth the price. On ""Mona and Tamsin on a Rock"" Alison even adds about 4 seconds of new vocals that immediately send chills down the body. Her voice is angelic. So besides the excellent score, ""The Swan"" is a great moving track. I live in a little hick-town and probably won't get to see the movie until it's released on DVD. But I read the book and it was nothing short of amazing. I hoped this helped!"
1,"Wouldn't know, never got it....","I did not receive my product. A month later I email them asking when I should receive it, if they knew where it was. I got an ""oops"" and a ""it was lost in the mail"". This does NOT meet the expectations I have when I order off of Amazon."
2,Six Minutes of New Music???,"Okay, I miss the old Goldfrapp. I think, though this electro crap is great fun to dance/drive to, I yearn for the good old Felt Mountain days. From the previews, this album seemed as though it would deliver the goods. It did, all six minutes of them. And what's worse, the so called ""goods"" were those little ditties that Goldfrapp used on their website as sonic wallpaper. Don't get me wrong, the songs are lovely, but they're 39 seconds long. Nearly everything else is *song does not actually appear in film or #song does not appear in film in this form! So you are paying a good 16.99 for six minutes of music. Lovely music, but hardly worth it."
3,A good mix of piano-jazz and contemporary music,"A good mix of piano-jazz and contemporary music. Not too hard, not too soft."
1,Microphone died after 4 days!,"The first set I bought lasted about 2 weeks before the microphone went out, the replacement lasted 4 days before the microphone went out. Also they were very uncomfortable, made my ears hurt and were ill fitted for small ears.Overall a huge disapointment, my first one with plantronics products. I definete ""DO NOT BUY"""
4,Nice sound quality... headset a little snug,"I purchased this set after returning the Pc USB Stereo Headset Multi Media with in Line Mute for lack of sound quality. This set is a huge improvement at a fraction of the cost. The only downside is that these are a little snug on my ears compared to the Logitech behind the head headset. All in all, I would buy these again for the sound quality alone."
2,"SNAP!, CRACKLE, POP!","When I got home and pulled these headphones out of the box I thought, ""Gee, what an awesome design! They have to be quality headphones."" But dont let the package fool you... these headphones gave me the most terrible sound quality. The sound was much more high pitched than that of any other head peice I ever had. It hurt my ears and there was nothing I could do about it. I searched for software to adjust the headphones, but not to my surprise there was nothing. That was the first of my concerns. Second was the light, rapid, clicking noise that I just could not get rid of. While these sets aren't too expensive, i learned a valuable lesson.... you get what you pay for."
1,Non Adjustable Headband Is Uncomfortable,"The headband on these headphones is a fixed size, so they are held in place by the pressure of the earpads against your ears. They were uncomfortable after 5 seconds, so I can't imagine wearing them for any significant length of time. I'm not sure what they were thinking - one size fits all is not a good idea for headphones."
3,CD2 Is Better,This Is Decent And Binge(Live) Is Brilliant But In The Live Version Of Last Resort Coby Is So Oviously Exausted That He Skips Most Of The Words And He Tries To Interact With The Crowd But The Crowd Are Too Lazy.It Dosen't Look Bad In Your Collection None The Less.
5,Greatest artist of the grunge period,Fantastic performance from one of the greatest songwriters today. Some great covers as well. Wish there was more camera shots from away. Too many neck and above shots. Small point though.
5,Vedder Than Ever,Someone should follow Eddie Vedder with a video camera every day. Loved the insight into the man and his music.
3,A Little Lacking,"Eddie is a great talent but I thought this disc was a little disjointed for my taste. It's part concert,part documentary, part singing with others. It's also short at 60min. It was a very different crowd he was playing to than I expected to see. Certainly not a crowd you'd see at a Pearl Jam concert.When Eddy dished SUVs & Hummers the crowd went awfully quiet for a bit.Hmmm. I guess I feel the stuff he's done with Pearl Jam is really hard to follow, some of that stuff is amazing."
2,"Great music, poor presentation","Obviously, the music is great. Eddie is a wonderful singer and has become a very good guitarist in the last twenty years. However, the DVD is painful to watch. Way too many close ups of Eddie's face. This is not 1992 and we are not sixteen year old girls. The editing is rough and thoughtless. He stops to tell a pointless, self indulgent story while tuning a uke, and then goes directly into a song on his Martin acoustic? Amateurish. The songs that play while Eddie sits in his hotel room, brooding and writing? Embarrassing. I recommend looking around for audio recordings of his recent solo tour instead. And go buy Ukelele Songs, it's amazing."
5,Great DVD made in the same style as PJ's Immagine in Cornice,A few years ago Pearl Jam put out by far their best DVD withImmagine in Cornice - Live In Italy. I like how this solo DVD is similar to that one in the way that it doesn't just film the concert itself. The film makers have put some effort into showing Eddie performing out in nature scences. It keeps things interesting.
5,awesome show!!!,Good audio and video quality. Eddie is the King! I recommend to anyone who like good music and great spirit.
5,Awesome,Totally Awesome. Totally Awesome. You will want to watch it over and over again! Acceptable for anyone who likes music. The two bonus cover songs: ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER and BLACKBIRD in the dvd EXTRAS are indeed a bonus!
5,Only Five Stars,This blu-ray will only get 5 stars from me. Merely for the fact that's all the stars you can give. This release is nothing less than amazing. Since I was a radio dj when Pearl Jam first hit the scene I was tuned onto PJ before most(Ten had a slow build up). I was a fan of Vedder's vocals from the start. This release does not disappoint.
4,Bluray,"I have the Bluray (only available at one retailer until June 28 when it's released to everyone else) and mine has audio issues, notably at the beginning of ""Girl From the North Country."" Anyone else have these issues?"
5,Naruto continues,"The second in the Shippuden Naruto series. Suitable for teens and possibly younger, but watch it first. Due to some violence.So far probably my favorite arc in the new series, but there are more to come and I can hope... ;)"
5,Naruto Shippuden,"well the dvd itself was in great condition, the price was amazing seeing how i live in hawaii and the anime well let me say im a huge fan of naruto :), i own every dvd, book, poster, figure, playing card ETC ETC!!!! lol love naruto and i enjoy every episode of it, i only wish i could speed up the release of the next one lol i have seen all shippuden episodes just not in english yet hehenaruto foreverbelieve it :)"
3,It's ok.,"t's certainly not one of my favorites, but it wasn't too bad either. I watched the whole series once and that was enough."
2,"Bronson is suave, but what happened to J. Lee?","Not a great film by any means, but mildly diverting. However, all credibility is lost in one key scene.J. Lee Thompson, director of GUNS OF NAVARONE and the original CAPE FEAR is amazing example of a man whose considerble skills deteriorated over time. This one is OK, but he degernerated even further in his later collaborations with Bronson.The film lost it for me during a scene where the assorted characters are making an exchange of goods in a drive-in movie. The marquee says something like ""Western Double Feature"" and if you look at the screen, it's the same 20 second loop of a cattle stampede.So the other moviegoers drove in not knowing the names of the movies they were seeing and were staring at the same 20 seconds of film run over and over again.I know from fond memories that drive-ins were make-out hangouts back in the day and we didn't always focus on the movie, but this is ridiculous!"
5,Great 70's fare...,If your a fan of Bronson and 70's movies in general then pick up a copy of this very un-Bronson movie and immerse yourself in simpler times.
5,Bronson,"I am a big Charles Bronson fan. I've enjoyed all his movies. St. Ives was one that I did not have in my collection and needed to get. I also, enjoy Slueth type movies as well."
3,Not Bronson's best.......,"St.Ives is definately not the best Bronson film that I have seen. The story and script are weak. The film's strong performances come from Bronson, Houseman & Bisset.A great character actor like Maxmilian Schell is wasted by Director J.Lee Thompson. J.Lee & Bronson have come up with much better stuff. Lalo Schifrin's typical 70's score is a highlight of this otherwise dull and listless flic."
3,Forget the Cats and Sacks,"Not bad Elmore Leonardish (or is that Leonardesque?) caper finds Charlie as the ""go-between"" in a twist-filled ransom deal that involves crooked cops, a daring elevator shaft stunt, and the lovely Jackie Bisset. Plus America's favorite old fart as an intellectual deviate who's hung up on silent films. Made by Mr. Bronson and Mr. Thompson back when both artists gave a damn, and therefore, far less enjoyable than ""Death Wish IV The Crackdown""."
3,Ok tool,"I like this tool, but it has some drawbacks. First off it's plastic, I'd prefer metal, and it needs to be nailed into the casing when measuring large openings by yourself. That being said it still works great and makes working by yourself much easier. It's overpriced for a simple piece of plastic though."
4,Nice Stout Tool - NOT Aluminum,"This is a handy little tool and I look forward to using it. One small disappointment relative to the other reviews, this one is not made out of metal. It is solid plastic. Still stout, but not aluminum. (I didn't see any disclaimer that the existing reviews were for a different product)."
1,not as handy as it looks,"found it hard to line up with casing and extremely hard to hold on to with the molding, I was expecting a miracle and didn't get it, I am back to the original way of marking with level then cutting to fit. Thought this was the answer."
1,For amateurs not pros,"This might be useful for a DIY newbie, but any pros thinking it's something a tool junkie needs to hang trim- forget it. Just another solution looking for a problem."
2,Agree with pointless,"This is a gadget. How much it will help you probably depends on your skill level. I do not know of a single pro-trimmer that uses this thing. Most pro-trimmers do not even use a tape measure for installing casings anyway, so this ""toy"" only adds a step. I highly doubt it will give you ""perfect miters every time"" so do not expect it will. Perfect miters are elusive to the best of us at times and it takes experience, skill, an accurate saw and a good blade, and a few installation tricks to to get the ""perfect miter"" that won't open up. Given that this tool ranks #4 in sales must mean something, but I would not expect it to deliver on all it claims it can do for your casing work. Bench Dog is makes some excellent products but I am not so sure of this one."
2,Trouble holding tape measure,"Am I missing something? I have the toughest time keeping the end of a tape meaure in the slots provided on this tool. The problem is that the raised part of this tool, which rests against the door jamb/window frame to mark the reveal, prevents the end of the tape measure to hook into the measuring slot because the tape is resting on top of this raised part so it can't slide securely into the slot.The tape measure tab end keeps popping out of the slot. The slots are also not long enough to fully seat the tab end of a standard tape measure. I really like the idea of this tool, but find it difficult at best to use because of this problem. Any comments to successfully utilize this tool are appreciated"
3,Not as useful as I thought,"I don't really ""get it"" ..maybe I'm not using it right...but haven't really found a place to use this yet...but it's still in my carpenter's hand box. Instructions appear to have been written by a pastry chef...not a carpenter. I do some casement work, but mostly cabinets. Maybe you'll have a better use for it."
5,Quite Useful,"I was somewhat surprised at some of the past reviews here. I've owned this tool for 2 years, and I've found it to be quite useful. I'm not sure what kind of miracles some here were expecting. It's just a simple, basic layout tool, that is well designed, virtually weightless and performs a number of useful functions for doing finish work. I have a lot of lay out tools, many of which can do some of the same things this tool does, but if mine came up missing today, I'd have another one by tomorrow. I have the plastic version and it is very sturdy, not flimsy at all, but I would love to find one of the aluminum ones."
3,not like it used to be,"this is the second one of these that i have owned because someone stole my first one, my old one was powdered coated aluminum, this new one is cheaper plastic, it works fine but i don't know for how long, i have had it now for about 3 weeks and it already shows signs of wear, i belive i might need to get a new one sooner rather than later, still a great tool just cheaper quality. So far i have not found a replacement that is aluminum. They just don't make em like they used to"
2,Would not trust in a presentation,"As a Grad student, I needed a laser pointer that would fit well with occassional powerpoint presentations. Cost was important, but apparently I did not pay enough. After about 2 weeks the laser became erratic, failing to operate at times and giving a low quality beam in others. I tried changing the batteries, but the only thing that seemed to work was holding the button down at just the right pressure. This surely is not optimal for a person who has other things to worry about during a presentation. Save time, embarrasment and your money by buying one of higher quality."
1,What a piece of s#/7!,Do not buy it! It is a piece of crap. I could not even open the thing to put the batteries in. The battery cap is like crazy clued to the body.
1,poorly made product,button fell off within minutes of receiving item. Definitely would avoid this item.
2,Replacement batteries impossible to find.,"I bought this item for my cat. The cat just LOVES laser pointers! I bought this item due to the fact that it uses AAA batteries. Simple to find and replace, right? WRONG!!! I have tried to replace the flimsy and weak batteries that came with the pointer (the brand is Powtek, ever hear of them?) to no avail. It seems that well known brands such as energizer, duracell, eveready, etc. will not work. They are just slightly too large for this item. I thought all AAA batteries were the same size, but evidently this is not the case. The Powtek brand AAA batteries are just slightly skinnier than the well known, and therefore easy to find brands. So go ahead and get this product if you plan on throwing it in the trash once the batteries need replacing"
1,Button breaks immediately.,Piece of junk. Broke about 2 hours out of the box and became useless. Don't buy it.
1,Complete piece of junk,"During my first talk (a job interview), the button broke off. This then creates another hole where the laser light shines out from. A great way to blind yourself, as well as disrupting your talk. Do you feel lucky?"
3,ok... at first,"I got this laser a few days ago, and after 3 days it has stoped working. It will go on every now and then, but it is pretty inconsistant. This may be due to the button or somthing inside. Also, amazon claims it has a range of 1,500 YARDS. but the package says 1,500 FEET. No big deal, since when it does work it is pretty bright. All in all, you get what you pay for, if you want one that will last, try the sharper immage ones, i bought one 5 years ago and it still works to this day."
4,Perfectly good for the price,"After reading the other reviews of this product, I was a bit leary, but decided it was worth taking a chance on since the price was low. Frankly, I'm quite pleased with it. The product description says it has a range of 1500 yards, which is clearly incorrect, but 1500 feet, in low light or darkness, does sound accurate. The unit feels solid, and the on/off switch clicks solidly. The colimnating optics aren't the greatest, so the beam does tend to spread out a bit, especially at distances greater than 500 feet, but this isn't meant to be some sort of fine scientific instrument, so that's no big deal. I did notice the beam flickering a bit after a bit of use, but I replaced the very poor batteries that were included with a good set of name brand batteries, and the beam became much more intense and rock solid steady. I recommend this unit!"
2,Low quality !,"Although this laser pointer is cheap, it is certainly low quality. Only 5 MINUTES after the package was opened, it began to malfunction. I have to press the botton really hard, and on the left side instead of the center, to make it work. Also it is very light and feels more like plastic or aluminum than 'solid brass'. Haven't got a chance to test standard AAA battery compatibility yet, but this was pointed out in other reviews. Conclusion: NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,ok if you like to waste money,I purchased this laser pointer and when Iopened the box and tried it it work but after awile the button came out and the coating on the brass scraped off andthe clip was like plastic and broke after a few days so like I said if you like to waste money buy this pen.
3,He hates this stuff.,"I LOVE Fromm pet foods and agree with an earlier review about my dog's coarse hair becoming soft and smooth after eating Fromm, but this particular variety is his worst enemy. He puts his tail between his legs and delays eating it until late in the afternoon when he just can't stand the hunger pangs anymore. Unfortunately, I had purchased a 30 lb. bag and he is a small dog. We made it (barely) through a third of a bag before I sold the remains on the cheap to a friend. Her dogs didn't care for it either, but her somewhat overweight dog ate it anyway (because she eats anything).Our local supplier of Fromm said that this variety is the least popular.Ironically, one of my CATS loves it! Must be the fish in it!Anyway, I haven't given up on Fromm foods for my dog, but I will never buy this variety again."
1,Not For My Dogs,Two dogs threw up the first night I fed. None of them liked it. I had to doctor up just to get them to eat it. One of my girls got the shakes and tremors like she'd been poisoned. Scared me to death! Thank goodness I only got one bad to try.
4,Perfect for large solder joints,"I purchased this iron to solder leads and ground wires to potentiometers, switches and output jacks on electric guitars and basses. It works perfectly for this type of solder job - but beware... do not use this for fine work or on items that require low temp solder joints. This baby gets very hot! I gave it 4 stars because the iron stand is nearly useless and cheap."
2,Didn't work for craft / charm /collage jewelry soldering for me,"I finally got around to trying my soldering iron today. I'm not using it for electronics, I'm using it for crafting collage jewelry and I'm using Silvabrite solder. It may be that Silvabrite has a higher melting temp that other solders, I have not tried this iron with any other solder but the tip won't melt silvabrite. You can get the silvabrite to melt if you put it halfway up the tip, but this is primative and the results look equally primative. Definitely need to be able to work with the tip to do nice work. I am going to look into a more expensive iron as soon as I post this review. The lady that taught me told me to get a variable temp iron and I didn't listen because I'm just too darn cheap. Oh well, it was an under 20 dollar lesson!"
2,The Tip died on me.,"This finally came in the mail, and I used it immediately.Takes a few minutes to warm up, but gets pretty hot after warming up. A few solders into my work, and I noticed a spherical dent in the tip. I continued working.As I soldered some more, the spherical dent grew bigger and bigger and bigger. The iron did its job tonight, but the dent is huge now, and I doubt it'll last me two more projects.Now, I have to buy tips or another iron."
2,Comes with Chisel Tip NOT Pointed!,"Disappointed in that this iron comes with a CHISEL TIP. Nowhere is this listed in the description and the product image is deceptive; unless you really look closely, it looks like a pointed tip."
1,horrific photos...these people need to be prosecuted!,I was horrified and sickened by the photos of blatant abuse to pit bulls! I cannot believe this book is being sold and these people are not being prosecuted.
4,Not necessarily informational...,"of the breed or the A-typical APBT owner, I myself having bred/rescued over 5,000+ of them in the past decade. But for those of us who simply adore and identify with the breed the photography is good. Furthermore, it is especially refreshing that is not a stereotypical ""ABPT Horror Story"" and is more uplifting, albeit moderately."
3,GRRRR....,"This book was a terrible disappointment, though the photography was very well done and the author was well intentioned. I know several APBT owners who aren't backwoods trailer trash or thugs. Joseph drummed up the cream of the crap with some of the APBTs owners he interviewed in this book. Also, for anyone that cares to know, Pitfalls Kennels DOES NOT health test their dogs. They are just backyard breeders on a huge scale. Stupid people all over pay them hundreds of dollars for sub-standard ""rare"" blue pit bulls. Thanks for giving these jokers lots of free advertising with your book."
1,Unfortunately We Are Robbed Again...,"...of the dignity of the idea that we own the most beautiful canines in the world. I was so very excited to see this book on the internet. I purchased it with a gift card, and had it mailed to my home. Imagaine my dismay when I received the book and opened it up to find photographs of dogs in cages, beside trophies, and men with big gold rings on their fingers! Where are the precious pits that I know and love?I think you tried, but missed the mark. I mean WAY missed the mark. This book is not for true fans of the pit bull--just people who think the dogs only position in life is to entertain their owners."
2,A Major Disappointment!,"I was delighted and excited to see this book sitting on the shelf, but when I opened it I was just as disappointed. It portrays this wonderful breed in every unattractive stereotypical manner imaginable (except for actual dog fights). One comes away with the distinct impression that the ONLY people who own this dog are those with rap sheets, scary dental work, multiplicitous tattoos, and Chateau du Trailer Park addresses. This book would merit only ONE star if it were not for the fine photography."
5,Great Book / Great Photos,"Well done, and very well worth the price. This is not just a book of photographs of Pit Bulls, this is really much more than that. Marc Joseph (the photographer) did justice to this breed, and to their people. The interviews, and the main text are great, too."
3,Cool Book,I bought this because I love James Frey and it is a cool book to look at but it's more of a coffee table book than the normal captivating books I've read by him.
3,An inside joke?,"On this EP, John Zorn and Yamatsuka Eye are poking fun at old klezmer 78s. Somewhere in the thick blanket of crackling static is the sound of Eye chanting while Zorn plays harmonium. If you can make out what these two guys are doing, it sounds pretty good. It's a spare, improvised recreation of old Jewish folk music, emphasizing the ceremonial songs and chants.But the static is too thick. And the album is too short. The songs aren't really songs, either. Zorn and Eye have cut their improvs into chunks of random length. If you own everything by Zorn already (like me), you might as well buy this. It isn't a complete waste. I still listen to it once a month. There's something authentic about it that keeps me interested. But if you don't like weird music, sound effects, or experimental ethnic stuff, don't bother with this CD."
4,Fire! Fiyah!!,"I can't get that song out my head. Very good album, a lot of filler though. They definately step it up on Meanderthal. If you're reading this and don't already own this go get it. Like tomorrow."
4,yeah,aunque no le di 5 stars me gusta este cd esta por la mazeta y tiene pal de cantantes como don omar y los bambinos hector y tito puede que no te gusten todas las canciones pero si te gustan como 10 es una buena inversion no se arrepentiran canciones favoritas (agarrala y gata fiera)
4,same thing!!,"For those of you who have bought the debut album, this is a great extra! Videos / Acoustic Performances / Live Performances.. its got some good stuff. For those of you who have been holding back for some reason & haven't bought this album already, I'd suggest to buy the 3DG Special Edition (CD+DVD) release, which includes this DVD. Nothing out of the ordinary.. the usual stuff that most bands are doing nowdays.. release an album accompanied with a bonus dvd, Some videos thrown in, with live performances, interviews.. bonus tracks! Money Making schemes basically.. Though I'd like to add, It's bands like 3DG that are actually worth paying the amount for!"
1,Beware!!! Description is misleading.,"Description states this the plug is white,that the harness will fit all Deltran Battery Tenders and is suitable for 12 volt systems. I have a 12 volt battery Tender Plus and the plug on this harness will not work. You cannot tell from the picture but the plug on the harness is completely different from the plug on the Battery Tender Plus. The desscription needs to state the plug is a different style, not just a different color. Amazon needs to be sure items have enough detailed/technical descriptions to avoid buying incompatible components."
4,Works with slight modification,"I bought this to install on a motorcycle so charging with the SuperSmart Battery Tender charger would be more convenient. When I first installed the battery lugs and connected the charger, no lights were lit on the charger. Turns out that the plug-in connector was wired backwards (at least for my Battery Tender). No damage was done to the Battery Tender, thank goodness! I changed the colors of the battery lugs and switched them upon reattaching and all is OK now. Would have rated 5 stars except for this problem."
4,"Good Show, Worth The Price","This is a very good Lucy show collection. Considering the age of this show, the picture is not bad at all. There are 36 episodes with this very good price."
1,Really bad,I can't figure out why some people like this album. The songs are pathetic even when not compared to the originals. I highly recomend buying the first Nativity in Black instead of this. Even Naitivty in Black 2 is better than this crap. I wish I could rate this lower than one star. Take my advice as I am a true Black Sabbath fan.
2,Awesome,"The actual product in the image unfortunly wasnt what i received, although it was at least the second one aka Hell Rules 2, got it fast with ok idea shipping.Besides that every thing was great."
2,must love death metal to enjoy this?!,only 2-3 good covers that are not death metal other than that the musics not bad buy the vocal suck the chrome off a trailer hitch(yes that bad/hard to listen to).
1,"Wow, people listen to that?","I have to agree with A Kid's Review, being a long time Sabbath fan, that ""stuff"" is like the worst excuse for music I may have ever heard. I would give it a negative infinity if I could. If Ozzy was dead, he would no doubt be rolling in his grave! Wow!"
5,Excellent death metal tribute disc,"This CD is really good, these for the most part unheard of death metal hardcore bands remake Sabbaths upbeat hard rock songs into heavy death metal songs. This is the best sabbath tribute album i have heard. My personal favorite is Hate Theory's brutal version of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. The other songs are really awesome but Hate Theory just really did this nicely with their lead singer screaming on top and their bassist singing in a low melodic voice in the background, i suggest any sabbath or any death metal fan to buy this"
2,A trip to Mars with a few science roadbumps,"I liked the book, in general, but about every fifty pages Bova's superficial science knocks me right out of the story. In the middle of the story, there's a meteor storm, which affects the characters like a machine-gun attack. AARGH! This ancient meteor-shower menace was already a cheap cliche (and unrealistic, to boot) back in the days of Flash Gordon. Then there's the ending, which makes me wonder if Bova paid any attention to what he described his characters as drinking. If you're not a science nit-picker like me, however, it's a good read. (And I really like the half-Navajo main character.)"
3,An okay ride with some interesting twists,"Bova rarely fails to entertain and he certainly does in Mars. His Native American hero is well drawn, but some of the other characters never quite click...they're a little shallow and predictable. All in all, the story feels real and so does Bova's rendition of the Red Planet"
2,Boring with a capital B,"Mars is a decent book at first, with a realistic view of what a trip to Mars would be like. The main characters are interesting enough, with conflicting relationships and problems. As the book goes on, you began to get bored though. One of the subplots about some of the characters being sick is ridiculous, and a major subplot is left unfinished at the end of the book. After finishing this book I was highly disappointed."
4,An entertaining travelogue,"Overall, this was an enjoyable read. I view it more as a travelogue than a novel. I liked the feeling of being along for the ride and the discussions of the technology needed to get to and live on Mars. The novel had a ""You are there"" immediacy that was very rewarding. The charactors, with the exception of the narrator,are fairly flat. Bova is no Frank Herbert in this respect. People seem to have one facet or intrest and that is all. What attempts at ""hidden agendas"" or insight Bova wrote into these people was so simple or silly it was a waste of space. Still, worth reading for the feel of a trip to mars. Of note, Bova never informs the reader what year the book takes place in."
3,Women Writers Are Different,"I just started reading this book and already I am upset at the ethnic and gender stereotyping. Women writers seem to create stong women without creating weak men. I find women to be more comfortable with political correctness, it seems less strained, less self-serving. In The Sparrow, for example, Mary Doria Russell gives us people who are different and unique, not sterotypical. I am a woman, and I prefer women SF writers for that reason. I do not want to dream of a future where we take all this unpleasantness which actually limits us. Hopefully, Bova is over this by the time we Return to Mars."
3,"Weak characters, but better science than the Moon series.","The science is much better than Bova's work in Moonrise and Moonwar, but again weak charecterizations and some implausible events made the story hackneyed and tiresome. Events become too convenient for the story's progression and the interplay of the characters too coincidental to be real."
1,Awful!,"Boring characters. Endless detail. Little action. Worst of all, INACCURATE! It is impossible to develop scurvy in a month. If the author messed up this familiar medical condition, how realistic can one expect other technical aspects to be?"
3,Good book but lacks action.,"I would give this book 3.5 stars if I could. It's got the standard Ben Bova elements such as:1. Interesting characters2. Multiple points of view, and multiple stories overlapping3. Politics, I mean real political machinery at work.4. Good pacing. He makes standard, mundane human activities very interesting and readable.5. Real good hard science.The only problem that I find is that the story has not exciting climax, to me. Once it's a forgone conclusion that they will find the remnants of life on Mars, the last 1/4 becomes a bit anticlimatic. I find that I need a little more space opera-type action for me to give the book 4 or 5 stars."
2,More a Textbook Than a Novel,"This book fell far short of the standards I had for it. The narrative jumped not just between characters, but also between planets and time periods. There's very little adventure or excitement and what really enraged me was that a character description in the book lied about one professional who is enraged and plots to make the protagonist pay for ruining his life's dream to study the Martian volcanoes, but yet he does nothing! He fumes and is enraged, but that is it!Parts of the book seemed too much like a textbook for my taste, and even got redundant with the author constantly reminding the reader that Mars' sky is not blue.Add it all together with stereotypical cardboard characters and it makes for a most dissatisfying read, not as bad as Allen Steele's Coyote Trilogy though."
3,Good but Flat,"A fascinating sci-fi novel about the first manned expedition to Mars. The story's more about the science than the fiction, which makes it very interesting to this reader, who suffers from a deplorable case of science deficiency. My only complaint was the poor development of the characters. I just didn't really care if anyone lived or died, which is a shame in an otherwise interesting novel."
5,A book showing the hardships of a mission to Mars,"This book is an excelent review of the mistakes all human beings can make. I thought it of an example of carelessness that human beings can and will have. In my opinion, Bova writes in a true, life-like style."
3,not bad,"while a good book, it never ties up all the loose ends. The book hints from the first chapter that the human race might have come frome mars. good, but I've read better."
4,Hard SF with a human touch,"Mars isn't everyone's conception of what science fiction is supposed to be: this is no sweeping, epic space-opera populated by intelligent robots and raygun-wielding starship captains. Rather, Mars is a story of exploration set against a brutally inhospitable backdrop. A realistic take on what the first manned mission to the red planet may actually be like, Mars presents challenges that are personal and environmental rather than the product of some moustache-twirling villain's skulduggery.Anyone fascinated by the scientific and sociological implications of space exploration will find Mars an absolute delight. Those looking for Star Trek will be sorely disappointed."
3,Interesting but predictable,"This novel was well researched and well written, but it was missing something. It was rather anti climactic and set itself up a little too well for a sequel. The characters are well developed and the story flows very smoothly. You could skip this one and you would not really miss that much."
1,Arrived Damaged Twice,"My toilet seat arrived both times, damaged. It was broken near both hinges, both times. Perhaps this item is not meant for shipment or maybeit's just very cheaply made."
1,THIS DEVICE NEEDS SOME RETHINKING BY SONY,"This does not do what it claims. The directions are impossible to understand and it does not work as stated, e.g., the directions state the front S Video/plugs-in are outputs but that has been changed on the unit. This cost me [money] which is lost!"
2,Lied,"I bought this dvd because I had read about it on the website of the person who created it. They lied. They tell you that you will see things that you never do. It is just a bunch of home movies, and most of them are crappy clips. It seems as if they are putting Manson down throughout the film. Oh, and it seems as if they finished the film, then got more content, and instead of re-doing it, they just added the stuff to the end... after the credits!The person responsible for making this film should take some lessons before making another.I like Manson a lot, but I feel this was a waste of money and time."
4,Having some fun!,"Just listen to Leon and Dr. John on ""Frosty The Snowman"" and you just know this is going to be fun. With his distinctive voice and with instruments like the dobro and accordian in the background, Leon has prepared a pleasant addition for any Christmas collection. ""Try to listen to ""There's No Place Like Home For The Holidays"" without smiling, if you can, you probably don't like Leon Redbone or Christmas music to begin with. Docked a star for brevity (29:41 is short for an LP!) and the dippy ""Toyland"" (What is this about anyway?) this CD is a keeper."
2,Christmas Island: Not up to par.,"I thought song selection was relatively poor. In sum, not a positive product from the Great Leon Redbone."
4,"com""YULE""ation Cleric : Bha Dha ""BING"" Buttered",""" Basic tracks recorded Decemeber 28,29 & 30,1987"", you know you can just tell there is still some lingering seasonal spirit echoing about. As with the first song"" White Christmas"" this must have been conceptualized as a `What If' production. Take late 8o`s tech and apply to what if Ol`Bing Crosby, The Christmas Crooner of Old, had recorded now in his prime.Great impression gratulated by Great crafting.This to my ear stamps the seal of favored seasonal songsmithing upon many a rendition to be dug here.Generalzations of individual tacks may be discernible from~~~~Merrily Mix~~~~1#1\2,2#1\2,3%,4#1\2,6#1\2,7#1\2,8%,9#,10#1\2,and 11$1\2~~~~only one bahhumbug,and I hated that song even as a kid.Post Script: What a guilding of artists, from Dr. John all the way down to Santa and the Islanders.Of course postcard artist,Leon,throws the shouldering throughout and buttered the bellower you bet`ya.****buyit*saveit*sharemost*giveit*donateit****"
5,Best Xmas Album Ever!,"As you can see from the title of my review, I simply love this album --- and I hate Christmas songs! This is a completely secular collection of lovely and delightful holiday songs that are a joy to listen to. This is the only Christmas album I own. I am so happy that they have re-released it after it went out of print. What is even better, there are two additional songs on this version. BUY IT! It is essential."
3,a Redbone white Xmas,"Leon Redbone's self-contained mystery as a wink from American classic music 1800's 1900's and stopped somewhere about the time of motorcars and musicals made a mark. The grumble and grin of his Xmas CD is at once old and new. As always, Leon strings and sings like Grandpa sittin' by the fireplace and the kids rollin' their eyes thinking,""What the Hell?"".and then the realization oh what fun this is our tradition now!Leon's version of ""Frosty the Snowman"" is what children will know, ""Toyland"" will make baby-boomers weep and buy too much!This stands as a classic Xmas CD that will bring families together.Leon Redbone? Yes!"
4,And Now For Something Completely Different...,"Released by Private Music in 1989 (after being first issued by August Records), Leon Redbone's Christmas CD gets yet another chance with Blue Thumb. My advice? Get a copy while it's still in print. Redbone's vocal stylings are such that you'll either love him or loathe him. I find his singing infectious and it works marvelously on this holiday offering. Especially charming is his vocal duet on ""Frosty the Snowman"" with Dr. John, who also plays piano on many of the tracks. In addition to accompanying himself on guitar, Redbone is joined by other musicians playing banjo, accordian, slide guitar, violin and clarinet to wonderful effect. While I still listen to bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" and Nat ""king"" Cole's ""The Christmas Song"" along with the other holiday standards, Redbone's music is a refreshing alternative to the Christmas mix. There is much to enjoy here. RECOMMENDED"
4,Snowman is an Island,"Who would have guessed that Leon Redbone, that fedora and dark glasses-wearing blues anachronism, was capable of producing such a sweet and charming Christmas album? Not I, that's for sure. Yet, here it is, making a fine addition to anyone's holiday music collection.Ably assisted by Dr. John, Terry Waldo and a trio of lovely violins, Leon handles the usual group of standards, a couple of rarities and one new original (That Old Christmas Moon) with style and aplomb. His White Christmas, with those violins gently wafting in the background, is enough to melt the iciest of hearts and the Dr. John duet on Frosty the Snowman is fun and marvelously infectious.At under thirty minutes in length, the disc may feel a bit sparse, but it never overstays it's welcome and offers a nice alternative to the overproduced, mass marketed product that poses as Christmas music these days."
5,Love Christmas,My mom had let me listen to a Leon Redbone album she had and it was love at first listen. I knew I had to have his Christmas CD and I was not disappointed.
5,Wonderful Christmas CD,"My favorite Holiday CD. Perfect blend of dixieland, blues and jazz combined with his unique voice makes for a wonderful collection of Christmas favorites."
4,Have a yule that's cool.,"This is a compilation album of ""swinging"" Christmas music. Most of the songs date from the '40s and '50s, although there are a few more recent ones. The style of the music is a mixture of jazz and ""adult pop"" (by which I mean the kind of music Frank Sinatra did, although he isn't on here). It's a very enjoyable album."
1,Horror Horror Horror,"Not one movie is watchable or interesting. After I checked the Horror movies out (after 5 years), I tossed the whole thing in the garbage. They're bad TV Horror movies, and not even bad American TV Horror movies, for the most part just bad Western Italian Horror movies. Do not buy this."
4,Nice collection of horror B-movies,"I have always been a fan of horror and thriller movies, although they almost all where boxoffice movies up trough the 80's and 90's till today, I also longed for some old classic B-movies.This is the perfect box. The funny thing is, that the movies that suck the most, are actually some of the funniest. And on top of that, the good B-movies are really okay.The only downside from this buy is that (living in Denmark, Europe), the danish taxes was higher then the actually cost for the box... hmm, but that seems to be my own fault.The only reason I wont give it 5 stars is, that I miss some more good quality B-movies in this pack, maybe som more Christoffer Lee and Vincent Price would be nice.Finally I know how it all began! :)"
3,Fair Selection If You Don't Already Own The 50 Movie Packs,"If you already own the ""Tales Of Terror 50 Movie Pack""and ""Drive-In Classics 50 Movie Pack"" you already have80% to 90% of the titles in this ""Horror 100 movie Pack""."
2,folding seat cane,"The item that was delivered, advertised as a Rubbermaid product, bore no signs that it came from or was manufactured by Rubbermaid. The product seemed sturdy enough but the seat was very small."
5,Awesome,"The best, and most easily understood books on the subject of humility that I have ever read. A must read for anyone desiring a closer walk with God."
2,Too fast and unorganized!!,"This collection of the former Robin's trials and tribulations in his new stomping grounds of Bludhaven was a little too chaotic to really enjoy. It seemed like there were about a two dozen storylines that Chuck Dixon wanted to tell and he crammed it in these ten issues. While some elements were good, others are washed out or completely rushed. Scott McDaniel's are was the same way. It was so frantic that the action was hard to follow at times. Overall, a disappointment."
5,Nightwing rules.,"The former boy wonder shows that he is no longer just a sidekick and proves it to his own mentor. Nightwing is becoming one of the greatest characters in modern comics, aided by the the compelling storylines of Chuck Dixon and Scott Mc Daniel's superb artwork."
4,A treat.,"In parts of this admirable and satisfying 19th century piece you might easily believe you'd uncovered a parallel universe Bellini, so ""Norma""-like are the melodies and ensembles. Not all, but most of this ""Saffo"" is a treat, made the more so bysumptuous vocalism from Louis Quilico, Tito del Bianco, and the ever impressive ""Queen of the Pirates"":Leyla Gencer.The sound is fair enough."
1,"Luckily, I listened at a friend's house...","... and didn't buy this repackaged sliced turkey! This is a mediocre piece of music, third-rate even by 19th C standards. It's horribly recorded, with shuffling feet and hacking coughs overwhelming the cellos and other bass instruments. The orchestra is ridiculously tinny and out of tune; I've heard better in plazas in provincial market towns of Argentina. The singing is ""period"" style, all right -- and a very bad period it was for singing, the mid 20th C, period! There is no reason to re-release such a travesty except greed.I had to save these comments for amazon, not wanting to antagonize my friend."
3,Curly's Last Hurrah,"""Three Little Pirates"" (1946) makes this particular Stooge compilation worth having. Despite ill health, Curly delivers his last classic performance - highlighted by the famous ""Maha-Aha"" routine. The remaining shorts pale by comparison. ""Uncivil War Birds"" (1946) is a dreadful Civil War spoof with no laughs. However, ""Back to the Woods"" (1937) has Moe, Larry and Curly gaining extra comic mileage from decidedly thin material. The overall print quality is good, but Columbia should have provided a decent 35mm master of ""Three Little Pirates."""
3,Interesting collection.,"This is a pretty good tape, with two good shorts, to one bad one. THREE LITTLE PIRATES, great short, and the best of these three. Curly was sick at the time, and here he gives his last great performance. Curly has a serious stroke on the set of the next short, HALF-WITS HOLIDAY. UNCIVIL WARBIRDS: A pretty good short. Again, Curly is sick at the time. The title, however, is too similar to UNCIVIL WARRIORS. BACK TO THE WOODS is a bomb. Too slow. The other two shorts here are okay, though."
5,Great!,Exactly what my nephew wanted and had been looking for! Thank you for this beautiful book! It is awesome looking!
4,Make Your Mark,"This is a great book, easy to read and packed with ideas to help individuals make their mark. Until reading MicroBranding, I had never thought of myself and how others see me as a brand. Yet I am amazed at how T. Scott Gross' information pertains to all areas of my life. In both my career and personal relationships, I have unique qualities and I need to be able to articulate them to others if I am to be successful. T. Scott Gross also recommends that we develop personal mission statements to keep ourselves focused on our goals in life. He gives lots of examples and stories and is quite entertaining. Lots of great networking tips and ideas too!"
5,Microbranding will become the new buzz word of 2002!,"As with Mr. Gross' previous book Positively Outrageous Service, I found Microbranding to be extremely well-written. It is not only grounded in apllicable, impactful content, but also written in a manner that is entertaining and fun!In my business (and my personal life), I have found that we often complicate issues until they either become too big to tackle or lost in the confusion. In MicroBranding, Mr. Gross clearly explains that this need not be the case when building a personal or local brand. Using real-world examples, he illustrates that building a powerful microbrand is both attainable and necessary. Understanding that you simply do not need a global brand to compete in your niche is one of the powerful pieces of information I gained from reading this book."
2,To listen to this.........,Don't like the sound of her voice. Wish I had not wasted the money. I wonder if these people listen to their recordings before they are sold?
4,This will work for most People,"This guided meditation is actually hypnosis which does not work on intellectual people. However, I find Denise Linn's voice to be soothing and professional, she's the best! The music on most of the tracks could have been better! It's like scary holloween music but on the second cd, it's very enjoyable.Also, If you have never done the fast breathing exercise Denise linn guides you through on the 3rd track, then this cd is worth buying for that reason. The first time I did it, my vibration sped up, and it nearely induced an out of body experience. Also, I have played this cd for a friend that went under automatically to a past life, so it does work with some people if not most."
1,Hard to read,Some info is outdated.Thiss book was required for a class otherwise I would not have purchased because it was hard to read
4,great gift item!,My kids have always loved the doodle bear. It washed great (right in the washer) and is like new every time. This makes the perfect gift for any child ages 3-8.
4,Fun,Very cute and fun. Make sure to use Spray and Wash when you wash it. Sometimes the darker marker doesn't want to come out.
2,Slow read,"I got all the way through this book because I figured that Ursula LeGuin saw something in it and I can see how she did, but it's mostly lacking the interest I find in her work. The habit of having a storyteller for every tale makes the characters distant so that you don't end up caring about them, and the scenery less vivid. This technique is supposed to give them the universal wisdom of fables but what the stories and characters tend to achieve is either common sense or a sort of vague mysticism that doesn't really accomplish the amount of depth it would need to have this style work. Well written and seemlessly translated, but overall a plodding read."
2,Dino Shines in Billy Wilder Misfire,"Dean Martin's inspired self-parody remains the best aspect of director Billy Wilder's failed sex farce. After a promising start, ""Kiss Me, Stupid"" quickly goes downhill - partly due to the horrible miscasting of Ray Walston (a last-minute replacement for Peter Sellers, who suffered a near-fatal heart attack six weeks into shooting). Scattered among the wreckage is Kim Novak's memorable performance as Polly the Pistol. Wilder and Martin obviously enjoyed working together, but they collaborated on the wrong project."
3,Potentially great but ruined by Walston,This Billy Wilder movie is potentially great but ruined by Ray Walston's poor acting. The movie is much more sexually explicit than most movies of its time period. Kim Novak is great as the sexy waitress subtly dodging the fingers of the men who are trying to fondle or pinch her well-rounded ass. But Walston's jarring portrayal of a jelous husband almost ruins the picture.
5,Great Comedy,"I bought this film because I like Kim Novak. Though her acting was good, I was not too crazy about her Marylyn Monroe impersonation. I discovered Felicia Farr for the first time in this picture and I hope to find other films she was in. The film is funny, acting and narrative is good, set is great. Dean Martin plays a great Bacchus and Ray Walston is very funny as the jealous husband."
4,Glad I bought it,I bought this movie because I never saw it any where before and didn't know if I would ever see it anywhere I like to see all the pictures dean martin is in
2,Poor Mr Martin,A rather unfunny film that has dated badly. Some moments but really misses the mark. Avoid.
2,Kiss Me Stupid,"This movie is intriguing because it was written by Billy Wilder and stars Dean Martin and Kim Novak. It may entertain hard-core fans and its subject matter was considered racy for its time, but the story never fully transcends conventional 1950s influences."
5,KIM NOVAK BEAUTIFUL,"Maybe if one thinks in a blonde beauty, Marilyn Monroe appears in the mind, but Kim Novak was as pretty as her, or maybe more. She was also an excellent actress. You must see this funny film!"
2,Loses pressure,"I bought two of these for my homemade press and they have seen constant use, I bought them at the same time. A year later, one is still fine but one seems to have lost it's macho, and will gradually slide downwards and I can't find anything about maintenance on these, anywhere. It mean it was cheap at walmart, but I'd hate to be changing the oil under a car and have these thing slowly descend onto my chest. Like I say, one still holds the pressure (usually just a few minutes are required for what I do, but the other 'deflates' pretty quickly. So, I wouldn't buy this brand again."
2,ok product,"i bought this item and i really enjoyed it when i got it and it worked just fine for a while than i found out in a couple of months it water pump works when it wants too and then at times dont work at all, and now the pump dont work at all but the lights still come on and work but no water comes out, and i took care of it like the paper that came with it said too and still had problems with it, so to anyone that wants to buy this item dont waste ur time and money on it cuse it dont work all the time and it doesn't give any solution to where to buy the pump at so to me it was a waste of time."
3,Sony should be embarassed,Word to the wise. Wait if you can and hope for a better product. Technology will leave this one by the wayside shortly.This could be a much better product. Take your standard CD player from any modern computer add a 400 cd carousel and ship it. Basically that is what Sony did.With all the technology available they should have some way to download play list directly to the machine. Who wants to type in the Artist Label for 400 CD's? If you don't play the machine in 30 days all of your information is gone.I only wish I had gone to Electrical Engineering School. This product would be so much better.
4,Worked out fine,came in quickly in good shape and is working fine.had one like it prior and like it for my use
5,sony cdp,"I had the previous Sony CDP that held 300 CDs - it was fine. This one is better - -not only holds more CDs, but is much easier to label and organize the CDs ( and holds more info). I would buy it again."
2,Sony CD400 CDP-CX400,"Had this model above for 5 years. Started skipping during playing any CD ..not scratched. My CX300 model is 8 years old, and works great. When you check the sony site for service, if not under warranty, it's about 195 bucks for an exchange, and 122 for service.I sure would like to know what's the problem with these? Don't exchange! Buy a new one for about 220, and smash the old one....make sure you video it and post on YouTube!"
3,"Great changer, horrible problems though.","I received the changer as a requested gift to replace a Technics SL-MC410, which was great btw, just not enough capacity. The only improvement in the Sony is more discs, but the only initially perceived benefit was it's ability to play mp3 discs. This is where the first major problem is: the lag time between tracks is HUGE. Playing mixes is incredibly frustrating. Even changing from disc to disc is infuriating, it takes longer than any changer I've used. Also, to add discs or even open the door requires stopping the item playing at the time. Overall, the capacity is impressive, but do NOT purchase this item based on its ability to play mp3 albums."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,"I OWN THIS CD PLAYER! I BOUGHT IT FOR THE 400 CD STORAGE. I ALSO OWN THE 200 STORAGE PLAYER. THIS 400 HAS SKIPPED WHILE TRYING TO START PLAYING A CD. WHEN THIS HAPPENS IT SCRATCHES THE CD.SINCE I BOUGHT IT NEW,I HAVE DAMAGED ABOUT 20-30 CDS.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PRODUCT!(MY 200 STORAGE HAS BEEN FLAWLESS!)"
4,"""The Last of the Mohicans""","Sony is the only one I could find with a mass storage CD player but that's okay since I was replacing an 8 year old Sony mass storage unit. Unfortunately, the first one AMAZON sent me was defective. They could not have treated the situation better though. They immediately sent out a replacement and had UPS pick up the defective unit. The replacement works great. Sony could improve this unit a lot by having the ""store bought"" CD's display individual song titles. That is done on the MP3 copies that you install into the unit. Other than that, I find the unit just what I need. The MP3 capability is the biggest single improvement over the old unit I had. It takes a lot of time to convert a bunch of CD's to one but that's not the unit's fault and it's well worth the effort for the sake of increasing storage capacity."
5,CD jukebox performs magnificently!,Ample storage for 400 cd's and easy programming for artists. and music types to play in blocks at the touch of a button.I've hooked it directly into my Bose system for a truly great listening experience.
3,Sony CDPCX455 400 Disc MegaStorage CD Changer,"Nice unit, convenient method of storing CD's. Works flawlessly. Sound quality is good not great."
4,Great DJ Unit,"I have used the changer serveal times since my purchase. It works great. Setting it up with track information was easy.My dis-like about the changer is, if you carry it with cd's in it, they will slip out of track if the unit is tilted.I am a mobile DJ and I can't see myself unloading 400 cd's and reinserting them at a gig. I don't unload it but carry it very level and with caution."
5,awsome CD player!,"This cd player is great I have over 400 cds and it's great not have to look for a cd to listen to, it's already in the machine."
4,Works for Us!,"I read previous reviews, and am a bit puzzled by the negative ones. We've owned one for three years, and its performance has been flawless. I did have to resort to setting up a Microsoft Access database to keep track of the CD collection, but that's not difficult. It takes some work to organize and maintain any type of filing system; CD changers are no different. Not one of our CD's has been damaged, BTW.We're planning to buy a second one.jw"
1,Not for Home Theater,"I bought a CDP-CX455 as a way to put all my gear into a cabinet out of the way. Sony, in its infinite wisdom, decided for the first time in 5 years to NOT have discrete codes for power on/off. Thus, this device is not suitable for remote location. Having MP3 is nice, but not having the discrete codes is a product killer. I have returned mine and gotten a CDP-CX450."
1,Product should be removed from the market,"My husband and I bought this CD changer two years ago and it has scratched about 100 of our 400 CDs. When we called Sony customer service, they told us that they were not aware of the problem. After spending $400+ on a changer that we can no longer use (or return), we have removed all CDs that are usable and purchased a new CD/DVD player. We are now in the process of replacing all of our damaged CDs. I would not recommend this product to anyone and I was very disappointed with Sony's customer service regarding the product."
3,Mega storage cd changer,"1st., The things I like about this CD player: It holds 400 CD's, so I can have easy access to all the CD's, some I haven't played for some time: You can play all the CD's by the same artist with the touch of a button: On all disks shuffle, the unit plays continously: A great storage unit.2nd. The things I don't like about this unit: You have to enter all the disk info my hand including the name of the album and the artist, using the jog, it takes for ever, using the computer keyboard helps but it is still a project. For the 400 hundred CD's, which I have, probably took me between 15 and 20 hours to enter the info. If you don't use the unit for a month, all the info is deleted, I can't imagine having to through all the time and effort to re-enter the info again.3rd. Would I purchase this unit again, probably not, for the reasons stated above."
3,CD player started skipping after 5 years,Just to add to the credance of the other reviewers who complained their player started skipping; so did mine. Very unfortunate because it is way out of the warranty period and even out of an extended warranty.
4,redue of origional review,I am fully satisified with this product. It had a hum when I first got it but the retailer did a good job on making good
4,Sony 400 disc cd player,"I'm very pleased with this item. It works as depicted. The instruction book could be done better, as it took a while to figure out some of the functions."
5,Music for anyone of any age,"This soundtrack is one that will never leave my side. The movie it came from taught me the joys and hopes of innocence and dreaming, and this soundtrack constantly reminds me of it. My only regret is that it will be passed over as childish and silly, so I write to those people: do not overlook little nemo. watch it, just once, and remember what it was to dream."
5,Good resource,"I have recently taken on the position of nursery coordinator in a church which has let this area of ministry ""run itself"" for a number of years. We needed to esablish a new set of nursery policies and procedures.This book provides useful advice for organizing (or re-organizing) your church nursery, including tips on recruiting nursery caregivers, health and safety considerations, room equipment and supplies, and programs for the kids.It includes many reproducible forms and notices which could be used directly from the book, or adapted for your church's needs.Additional items are available for purchase, including a poster set, CDs, cassettes, picture cards, and activities.This book has ideas and suggestions for a nursery that cares for babies 0-24 months. Some options for preschoolers is provided, but it is not nearly as extensive for that age group."
1,Is this for real,"Not knowing the author personaly, I question his authenticity. It would seem to indicate that he is a self made hero. This man has claimed to have been a POW which is not true. This makes me question the truthfullness of the book and wonder if it shouldn't be in the Fiction section."
1,Disappointing self-agrandizing rant,"Unlike Mason's ""Chickenhawk"" and Spalding's ""Centaur Flights"", Maverick is less a story of military aviation and helicopters than it is a story of his personal prowess in all things masculine. His halty, broken writing style is rhythmless and without style. Worse, the author's constant second- and third- person references to himself were particularly grating, especially given the tone and color of events he relates. This is one storyteller who no doubt finds himself alone at the bar soon after he begins his tale. If you liked Mason's guileless style of self-baring, you will absolutely hate Marvicsin's self-deception.I gave up after one hour's sincere effort to plow into the story. This is one destined for the wood stove when the temperature again dips below freezing."
5,Was the book fact or fiction,"As for the persons that gave the book one star I bet they never have been to Vietnam or met Denny in person. I have a autographed copy of Maverick because I use to know Denny as we were in the same area in Vietnam and again met him in 1996 at his work. To think the book is fiction is to not know Denny or much about Vietnam. I have read 99% of the books written about Vietnam and Maverick rates in the top 2% of the books on Vietnam that I have read. If you knew Denny you would know that everything in the book is true as he is not the type person to add fiction just to make a story more interesting. Heck there was no need to add un-truths as there was plenty of truths to fill several books! As the note Denny wrote in my copy of Maverick says... ""This book was written so no one would forget""""You were there no excuses needed"""
5,"... says ""Hidden Messages"" scores a direct hit!","Did you know that there are better ways for parents to communicate with their children? Thanks to Elizabeth Pantley's book ""Hidden Messages"", parents will find that the answers are just a few words away.Throughout the book, parents will discover how their own words and actions affect their child's behavioral development. The book includes sample situations and dialogue between parents and their children, and discusses the ""hidden messages"" that the parents have just expressed. Elizabeth further helps parents to understand their own actions and gives them ideas on how to change their behavior and how they communicate with their children.""Hidden Messages"" is sure to become a staple in every parenting library. I highly recommend it!"
2,"Ho-hum. Pretty common sense, little useful info","Oh please. The examples were all cheesey, and it was so obvious what the ""hidden message"" was. Parenting would be EASY if all you had to do was be as obvious as the examples given. I bought the book expecting a more complex treatment of hidden messages and child development, but all we get are a bunch of vignettes which are pretty easy to avoid in your own life if you're paying any attention at all."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK!!!!!,I could not stop reading this book! The short stories make it so interesting that I couldn't wait to read the next. I think all parents will be able to relate to many of the stories and learn so much!!!
3,its OK,Its ok its kinda cheap and hard to keep the fake nickels inside the cap but its an easy trick pretty self explanatory
1,Not worth a dime.,"Does not work. Tried several ways to get it to work, no luck.Save your money. Not worth a nickle or a dime."
2,Disappointed,This was a gift for my grandson who fancies himself a budding magician. He said it did not work. Since it was so inexpensive it was not worth returning or complaining about.
4,easy to learn,easy to learn and preform great trick to make people think! a lot of fun with kids they look on in amazement
3,OK for the money,"I've seen higher quality versions of the same trick. My kids were able to figure this one out pretty quickly because there was a pretty visible line where the two halves attached together. It was also difficult to get everything together tight enough to keep the top nickel from rattling.That said, the price is right and as long as you don't let your audience spend too much time examining the parts afterwards it should go over just fine."
4,Add this one to your Christmas collection!,"I just got this cd the other day and have already listened to it several times. I like the variety of the tracks and can picture this as background music for wrapping presents, baking (which I dont do) or for Christmas gatherings. I especially like the Nicolette Larson singing One Bright Star. I personally would have added the O Holy Night from Jewel- but Martha didnt ask me."
4,Lexar Media 64MB Memory Stick (MS064260,Holds all my Medical data.Dont buy it for keeping your music or pictures.
5,Great! Lasted longer than my camera,"I was very pleased with this memory stick. I upgraded from the standard 16 MB memory stick that came with my Sony camera and I had no problems whatsoever with the memory stick during the time I had my camera. I don't plan on buying a Sony camera again, but I would definitely buy another Lexar memory stick."
1,Avoid Lexar at all costs.,"I bought one of these for my new digital camera. 4 days and over 50 MB of photos later, this Memory Stick had a fatal error, taking all of my photos with it. I tried to retrieve the data several ways and all failed. Buy at your own risk. I'd go with a different brand if I were you. I lost photos I'll never get back, and when I returned the stick, the guy at the store told me that this happens more regularly with Lexar than other brands."
4,Very Nice!,"As a fan of the Tzadik label, I always know it's going to be something different or special. Stolen Memories is a special record and a fine record for people ready to try something new. While it might be a klezmer record, there are enough different sounds here, that others will like it too. ""Wave Hill"" is a stand out track with a haunting repeating melody line, many Steve Reich fans would love. The stunning piece builts slowly, but never extends itself too much. Other amazing tracks are ""Skating on thin air"", which sounds almost like something of an ambient record and the title track ""Stolen Memories"". If I have to say anything bad, it's that ""Donut Ask, Donut Tell"" seems out of place. Not because it's bad, it's a cute little song (only vocals on the record) but it's doesn't fit the rest of the record.If you are reading this, you probably already know a bit about the music or Guy Klucevsek, so just know that it's great and another beauty from Tzadik"
2,Pretty bad pointer.,"This pointer felt kind of cheap. It was not at all like the picture. It was a lot uglier.The laser heads were useless and they weren't very good. The picture does not come out clearly, there are blurs around the image.The laser dot was not very bright. It could have been brighter. It should be smaller also.I bought a laser much thinner and shorter than this one that uses smaller batteries in china. It meets the whatever health requirements and the dot is a lot brighter."
3,"Pointer good, 42 picture heads disappointing","This laser pointer gives a good laser point for presentations up to 500 feet and is comparable to other laser pointers I have used. The pointer is compact (approximately 3 inches in length) and fits comfortably in your hand. The 42 picture heads, however, are not as impressive as advertised. The quality of the pictures in the heads (i.e. Zodiac signs, arrows, and symbols) is low. Instead of a single picture, there are faint duplicate images that blur the quality of projected image."
2,"Amusing Toy, but Very Shoddy Construction","This is an inexpensive and amusing toy. However, the mechanical design and is extremely shoddy. The activation button began mal-functioning immediately, making turning the pointer on a hit-or-miss proposition. While the button initially responded about 90% of the time, the response has now dropped to about 10%.I will be replacing this pointer with another and not buy any product from this maker again."
1,Worst Laser,"This laser, having a short life span. the many tips are low quality, and i wouldn't reccomend it to anyone"
4,This laser pointer is a good one.,It is a good laser. It does not shine the best but then all you have to do is pull the batteries out and then put them back in. It shines really far at night. The laser does work its best during the day but works the best at night. Some of the heads do not shine very bright but I had only three that did that. Their was only one head that was backward. What I mean is happy was yppah. If you are looking for a good laser but you don't want to pay a lot I would get this one...
2,"O.K., but nothing great","This laser pointer works well when you first get it, and you are stunned with it. A few problems with it are that the batteries are hard to put in, and next to impossible to get out. Another thing about it is that the switch failed on mine. When it worked, I needed someone to help me pull out the switch to turn it off. Oh, and one more thing. DO NOT JUDGE YOUR PURCHASE ON THE OVERSTATED RANGE INFORMATION!!! Right on the box it says Range-1,500 FEET! When you can get it to work, it's good, but it's not worth all the trouble."
2,Buy a real pointer!,"I bought this thinking it would last me awhile...well, it didn't after normal business use for two days...it decided not to wake up the third morning...so I changed the batteries -- guess what -- it wasn't the batteries.The inserts are nice, but to be honest most were not clearly etched and produce fuzzy images.If you plan on needing a relabile pointer -- buy a high end one that does one thing point...and not something that you can impress your nerd/gearhead friends with."
1,THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.....,"I thought this was a good item beacause since it can point 1,500 feet.but when you press the button too hard the laser goes out. and it does not shine bright. if you want a good laser pointer buy the pen shaped one beacuse it is very worth it. not like this."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I was looking for an inexpensive laser pointer and I found it. The only problem is that it is cheap, not inexpensive. The button sticks and has to be pushed just so or the laser is not very bright. The 42 tips were cute but not very functional since the red laser doesn't always shine its brightest. It works as a cat toy but I wouldn't rely on it for anything else."
3,Inconsistent quality,"I just bought three laser pointers from two different sources through Amazon, and the quality is not the same. Two from performancepda_com were ok ($14.95) and one place that did not come with 42 head which cost <$9.50 was useless. Terrible quality of the laser beam. Cannot see far at all and the beam was narrow. Overall, very poor quality for presentation purpose. If you use for fun, then it is ok."
1,SUCKS,"I NEVER EVEN GOT IT AND IT TOOK FOREVER FOR THE STUPID SELLER TO GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY. CON-ARTIST. I BET HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY OF THESE THINGS. DON'T BUY PLEASE, FOR THE SAKE OF ALL SANITY DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"
1,BATTERY COST TOO EXTREME AND DNOT LONG LASTING,I have had these wristwatch 2 way gmrs radios and purchased a battery. These batterys do not last long and go dead in about a year. The cost is $18.00 plus shipping to replace a battery. Well you can buy a new set of radios complete for that on ebay. So why are these batterys so extreamly expensive? I do not know. Anyway i got rid of the radios that use these batterys. These are not recommended and is my opinion as a user of this product. These should last as long as a standard cell phone battery and cost only a few dollars. Not recommended at all.TOYTREKER
3,Charles David Red Patent Leather,"I have been waiting over 2 week s to received a return label in the mail as my printer is down. I have called atleast 4x regarding this label.I am still waiting. The shoe is well made, Great price but not my style."
3,Vato Loco,"This is not mr. lil one's best album but it is one of the best albums he has ever come out with, even though his last album the boogieman was better than this one, but he did a great job in his new album, the track 10 should be a classic song for the whole latin hip hop industry, the track 9 with shadow is good but i am surprised that he really made the track 12 ""sorry"" confessing all his sins to God, in my opinion track 12 is the best song i have ever heard from mr. lil one since he came out with his first cd, i am a big fan of him, buy it homes 619 pa' la raza......................."
4,this alt-folk-country-rock stuff doesn't stink...,"I admit that I'm resistant to bands that challenge my notions of what 'indie music' is all about. I was worried that Ida would be too country, too folksy, too cheesy, too something for me to enjoy. Yet I find myself completely enthralled with Ida. In fact, I'm almost embarrassed to say that I only ever heard of Ida just 3 weeks ago for the first time.There is something simple and gorgeous about each track of this cd. The female/male harmonies are perfect and moving. I will say that I am much more partial to the tracks sung by the woman in the band. The male vocals tread dangerously into that headachey-alt rock lilt that gets my hackles up, but still, they're not terrible.I'm impressed with the lyrics and overall instrumentation of this album. Keep in mind that I am pretty much a rocker who would choose Brian Jonestown Massacre over Rilo Kiley, but I can't stress enough what a refreshing surprise this album is for me."
4,title of review,"This band isn't much about rhythm or melody, they're all about harmony. Their songs are mostly driven by the dense harmony of the guitar chords, and the chords that drive these songs just sound like I've heard them all before. They have nothing new to offer, no new ideas, they're just rehashing and going through the motions. It's lovely pleasant music, but for someone who's familiar with the band's discography, I don't see this release being very worthwhile."
1,"worse than bad, it was CRAP!","This has got to be one of the WORST TV productions in recent years. The subtitle ""The truth behind the legend"" is a joke.The narrator (ghastly, reading from a script) makes endless stupid mistakes, which even if the idiot script writer had put in the script, he should have known to correct (like substituting ""empirical"" for ""imperial"" and ""Victorian"" instead of ""victorious"" - I'm not kidding).Some of the photography of the Roman homeland were clearly Greek islands!I mean, how bad can it get?Why waste our time and insult our intellect showing Stonehenge and saying a wizard stole it from Ireland?I think it should have been titled ""The Story Of Geoffrey of Monmouth, The Lies Behind The Legend""The writer of this silly ""epic"" clearly never read more than the guidebooks put out by local entrepreneurs trying to sell the Arthur legend on their own patch. Not a scrap of truth or evidence anywhere in view.Uuugh!"
3,Not Keen on Keane,Damian Lewis is spectacular as ever. BUT this was the most depressing story I have seen in years. The only reason I didn't pull the plug was Damian's performance...he never fails to rise above the material.If you are a Damian Lewis fan I RX.
3,Thumbs up for Damian Lewis,"Great acting job by study Damian Lewis as he portrays a mentally ill man, however, I wished for more back story about the divorce and missing daughter."
2,So Minimalist It Almost Isn't There,"A very unbalanced man who ""may"" have had a daughter abducted abuses drugs and sex and then befriends a desperate single mom. The fact that he stands over her little girl in the shower could mean he is confusing her with his own daughter or that he is a potential pedophile. I didn't like the non-ending and didn't feel like it added any resonance to this very incomplete character study."
4,Powerful performance,"Damian Lewis is so unrelentingly heartbreaking in this film. Watch it when you're looking for great drama, but not for comedy."
2,"great concept, tedious execution","On paper, this film sounds like it will be a great psychological drama, but its execution is a bit creepy and very slow moving. The movie's running time is only 100 minutes, but it felt like it was 100 hours. Nevertheless, it offers a fast glimpse at the always cute Abigail Breslin. Damian Lewis's performance is awe-inspiring and he attempts to carry the film, but the result is quite unsatisfactory."
3,This is a quirky movie.,"It starts with Bill Keane looking for his daughter at New York Port Authority. She has been missing for a few months. You wonder while watching if he's crazy from losing his daughter or if his drinking and drugging over the loss of his daughter is caused his descent into madness. Or maybe he's mentally ill and there isn't a daughter. Maybe it's all in his head. He meets a woman with a daughter around the same age as his. I don't want to say more so I don't give too much away.There is a lot of close-ups of his face and the movie is mostly dialog with little action. If you want to see something different, here it is."
1,An aquired taste,There is nothing action packed about this movie. Nothing at all;dont waste your time seeing it if you are looking for fast paced thrills;if you have doubts about what i'm saying you can try watching the first 5 minutes and see if you like it....it's like that throughout the film.This is not so much a bad film but it depicts life in that it's slow and quiet with moments where you wonder why does the character go on. It's not a wham bam film and those who like such films shouls not even try this one on for size.Not recommended for all viewers.
3,Low Carb Pizza Crust Mix,"This spreads out in a pan and sticks together pretty good. If you put enough ""stuff"" and pizza sauce on the top it isn't half bad. Since I put very little pizza sauce it lacks a lot to me. I shall continue to use it and prefect my own ""stuff"" to make it good."
3,Not So Bad,"If low carb is a must for you, this crust isn't bad, but it is very high sodium. About 1800 mg's for the entire pizza. A rolling pin won't work with this dough. You have to press it all out in the pan, which isn't so bad. It serves it's purpose as a pizza dough though. Mind you, Netrition.com sells this two bucks cheaper than Amazon."
3,A little disappointed,"I have to say, I was disappointed with this CD. Am I glad I bought it? Yes. I bought Becky Taylor's first album, when she was 11 or 12. I thought she had wonderul potential - her voice was sweet and angelic, not pretentious and overzealous like her counterpart - Charlotte Church. So, I was greatly anticipating her second album, now that her voice has matured. The album was decent, her voice has gotten darker and is still quite lovely. She is definately a pop voice, not classical crossover. What I was really disappointed in was the songwriting. None of the songs really inspired me. She does a sweet arrangement of Bette Midler's classic ""From a Distance"", but not much else is memorable. This CD is good for a background music, but not much for serious music lovers."
4,Inspiring story of a retired English couple,"Before we began barging, I read all of the Cooper's books, as did my husband. I admit, a few of their adventures - their Mini pushed over the bank by pranksters, their brave trip at sea in their flat-bottomed boat and the trip through Eastern Europe - made me think twice about what we were doing. In the end I realized they had the same dream we did, and adventures and all, it is a wonderful way to see the world."
2,A Disappointment,"This is the first Doig novel I've ever read, and I'm afraid it will take a great deal to get me to try him again. This book was a real disappointment - from the characters I had a hard time caring about to the unbelievable dialogue. Who talks like that? Seattle may be oh, so hip, but pu-lease! Doig throws in so many one-liners and cultural references, it's like listening to a Dennis Miller routine. Yeah, I get 'em - it just becomes ridiculous after a while. I almost threw the book down when I came to the line ""I came, I saw the paperwork, I don't concur."" Yuck.The best parts where those describing the land - Montana, Seattle, Alaska. The book was good enough to get me through a flight to D.C. and back, but to compare this writer to Wallace Stegner causes me to wince."
3,The First Time I've Been Dissapointed by Mr. Doig,I wait for Mr. Doig's books and have never been dissapointed until now. Unfortunately I got stuck on someone driving from Seattle to White Sulpher Springs going through Choteau. Didn't make much sense and I kinda of lost it after that. But I will not give up as I re-read many of his books every year.
3,Dissapointing Doig,"Having read Dancing at the Rascal Fair, I was very dissapointed with this work. Like the comments posted, I found it trite, cliched, and hard to get into at first. The problem with setting anything in a particular place in present time is getting the details right. Doig failed at this. I found the dialogues between Lexa and her sister painful to read, they were so focused on a comedy routine. Nothing about this book made it any more special than any other tenth grade fiction class work. I urge others to give Doig's other works a read; they are worth the time. Mountain Time definitely is not."
2,A Stylistic Exercise,"After reading four prior Doig novels and loving three of them, I felt that this would be another good read. I was wrong. I found it hard to care about the characters and felt that Doig was relying his overly-stylistic prose rather than developing a story. After reading the other bad reviews, I tend to agree with their characterizations, but will now have to finish the book as I just began the backpacking trip which I is where I tossed the book down in disgust. As an avid hiker and one who has traveled the country Doig writes of, I found the trip account unrealistic and painfully uninformed. The only reason I didn't choose 1 star is that ""I hate it"" is too strong a statement for a book I couldn't care about."
2,Not Stegner,"I wanted to like this book. And in places the novel is satisfying, for example when Doig's characters are involved in nature (especially the trek to the fire tower). Especially pervasive throughout is a dialogue that just doesn't work - people don't normally converse the way Doig's characters do - at least not throughout the entire story. The repetitive, ""so-hip"" banter between characters becomes annoying almost from the start. The characters too were so extreme that I felt each person developed into a caricature, or stereotype that was so hard to become involved with, or develop sympathy for.I would have quit this book mid way but for the hype on Amazon. Especially the comparisons between this author and Wallace Stegner. Compare this book to say Crossing To Safety, and you can see just see what an unbelievable stretch this comparison is. And it may have set up expectations in my mind about Doig that were unfair to him."
4,My first Doig,"Whether its because I'm a fifty-two year old guy who has had to deal with remarkably similar circumstances of ashes and irony, a distant daughter, moving on in life (to the Northwest)- I was able to look beyond the occasional too-hip dialogue and sometimes hyperbolic character or two and become unexpectedly engaged. The trek into the ""Bob"" was a joy."
1,Could have been told in a short story format,"It has taken me about three months to read this 400 page book. This story is told in a time-span of about two weeks in April of 1137 in about 15 chapters and never once leaves the original site where it began. As the chapters changed, I thought we were going into a new month. Yet, we were only going in to a new day. If you like to be completely strung along and bored for hours/days/weeks, then this is the book for you. If you like action, fantasy, intrigue, and real meaty History and adventure, this is definitely NOT the book for you!"
4,Markers,I emailed the company about the marker issue and they informed me that any of the washable markers on the market will work on the bears. I hope that helps someone make their decision. It sure helped me. The company replied to my email within hours. Very good customer service!
3,doodle bear... OK,"daughter loves it, but i think it is a bit annoying to have to wash it and dry it each time you want to start the drawing over... and my daughter keeps asking.. IS IT DONE YET?? wish they could come up with a better way to wash it."
3,My View on Doodle Bear,"While observing how my daughter liked drawing on it, and appeared to have some fun, she quickly tired of it within a week or so. Washing the bear is all it says, the marker really does come out. So no problems there.The doodle bear now just sits on her bed. Not all children will react the same with this bear, but just had to add my 2 cents.Good price also. Would've hated it if it costed more with 'our results' on this toy. All in all, I'd give it a shot and see how your child likes it. Especially if he/she likes to draw.:)"
4,yay,yay they are so cool i have wanted one like since last year i finally got 1 last night there fun because i cant draw on bears in my room because it dosent come off but doodle bears do in the washer draw and put in the washer and its clear again my sister got drew the purple one i got penny the pink one they are so ausome for a present or somthing there just cool!!!!!!!
3,I really wanted my daughter to love this toy!,"I waited excitedly for this arrive and my daughter was very happy to receive the bear. She played with it for a few minutes...drew a few pictures...and then set the bear down and lost interest in it completely. She is very creative and loves to draw, but this was just not interesting enough to hold her attention. Maybe because she's 3 1/2...it seems like a toy that maybe an older kid might enjoy more. I guess I was just hoping this would hold her attention for more than 10 minutes.Great idea though!"
2,MommyTeacher,"My daughter had to have this toy; received it and has not played with it at all. She said it is not soft, she doesn't want to sleep with it or snuggle it, so she doesn't want it. She is 4 years old, so maybe it is really for an older child?"
2,Not that great,"It does wash out, but I'm not that interested in it. I haven't played with it that much."
2,Mixed feelings,"My daughter really wanted this bear. She loves to draw on it and really likes it. I, however, do not think the quality of the markers it comes with is very good. They do not show up dark enough on the bear. The other thing I did not like about this toy is how often you have to wash it. My daughter will draw all over it which takes about 5-10 minutes and then she wants to start over. When I tell her I have to wash it she gets upset. It takes forever to have to wash and dry it so she can play with it again!"
5,"Letters,Love and Longing","Mr. Oz manages to tell a story of great passion without a hint of sentimentality. He sets this amazing story within the political context of 1970-s Israel and perfectly places each character within this scene. The characters in this novel are memorable for their failings as much as their strengths. Brilliantly writing in each of their voices, Oz reveals their ties, lies and love for each other. I encourage everyone to read this beautifully written book of letters from a truly gifted author."
2,A Little Boring,"The title of this book is quite well chosen. It's the black box of a relationship which have suffered havoc. In the book you witness, in letter form, the various parties involved in the wreckage of the relationship and you get to hear about how life proceeds in the wake of the break-up. Amos Oz, I think, is a narcissistic person, and you get to hear about his glory and his follies, from his ex-wife and the other parties. If you have broken up with someone, and you are filled with angry feelings, bitterness and regret, then reading this book can possible have a cathartic effect upon you. But I found it a little boring."
5,The Israeli Tolstoy,"Black Box is an epistolary novel, composed of letters of the main and minor characters. Oz uses this form to great advantage. Rather than having one stable viewpoint, either from a first or third person narration, the reader gets the benefit of multiple perspectives. This allows Oz to show the unique virtues of each character, even thought they come from divergent backgrounds and have different moral and intellectual strengths. The overall impact is a deeply humane novel, where Oz allows no one character to be a villain, even as they recount their villainous deeds. In this way he accomplishes what Tolstoy does in Anna Karenina: every character is given full reign to do both good and evil, but the totality of their experience makes them likeable, even loveable. In Black Box, the simple act of writing a letter becomes a vehicle for delving deep into the human experience."
5,Very amazing story-telling,"A very unique book. Once you get into it you just cannot leave the plot.I first read it, three month ago - and Just last week finished the second reading.If you want to know a new world of people and the life of a family that will make your day - this is the book for you."
3,"Frustrated, but incredable!","This is how I feel about this book. You won't believe one thing though. This is one of my textbooks for Comparative Literary Studies. More specifically, Middle-East Literary Studies. I know I can draw a lot of comparison between Israli literature, and Arabic Literature upon Oz's novel, and others. Still, I feel frustrated about this book personally. I think in one point, it may be realistic about the letters' cruel intentions between the couple, and the harm they did to their son. One thing I hate the most about this novel is the lawyer's writing. It's boring, monotone, and hard to understand! It's as dead as a stone!!! Other than that, I think this book deserves a four out of five, withouth the letters from the lawyer!"
5,Streetwise Rome,"There's no disputing the point that there are more complete, more dtailed maps. However, that misses the point. One does not ordinarily need microscopic detail in negotiating an unfamiliar city. What one does need is a broad outline of the city that can be speedily referenced to orient oneself. For this purpose (primarily that of the tourist), Streetwise is THE superior product. If you need detail, buy a Mapsco. If you just want to quickly figure out where you are, Streetwise is the way to go"
3,Very very small,"This is an accurate although not completely comprehensive map of Rome (missed a few streets in the heart of the city). It is compact and durable, but the print is way too small for these 47 year old eyes (I do not wear glasses to read). Fortunatley, I copied and enlarged the map in sections before leaving, keeping the laminated original for backup. I would look for another."
2,What a disaster,"They have got to be kidding??? What a cheap pile of not only substandard recordings, but a hodge-podge of random songs with no flow or feel to their sync. This lad could be the voice of a generation if he would stick to what he has produced so far, and not CHEAPENED himself with this sell-out money making Walmart sale rack junk. What the he11 is that cover??? Grotesque and cheap, he looks like some boy band juevenile punk getting his first woody.We expect WAY more from you Josh. You have a genious musical talent. Quit letting your lame management sell you out this way! You'll be on the slippery slope with Ricky Martin and Clay Aiken - UGH."
2,CHEAP,these stands are not that great they fall apart very eaisly and dont keep their height and needs to be adjusted several times to maintain its height.
2,"nice inexpensive stand, some problem with secureing it","it is okay, having a bit of problem secureing it. for some reason the screw went around and around does not tighting it I let it along pray no one would touch it."
5,"Rich, dramatic, colorful, authentic, and always evocative","Each successive album has advanced my appreciation of Alasdair Fraser's musicianship. Here he's joined by talented guitarist Tony McManus in arrangements and variations that embrace the full possibilities of the original melodies, all the while evoking the authentic Scottish idiom. Their performance of Sleepy Maggie will make you think you are hearing the tune for the first time. In my humble opinion, Fraser's best recording to date."
3,Ronnie is always Ronnie,"Ronnie has no problem standing alone....he's driven to live a rock and roll life, and this is what you get from his compulsion.....good stuff, great slide (which you would expect from the title), hard & raw (even with Bernard trying hard to give him some class). He had no problem standing alone while he was in the Faces and throughout his 17 year Stones ""apprenticeship"" so by 92 he had it down. On this one he uses Charlie Watts, Bernard Fowler, Ian McLagan & Chuck Leavell from the Stones machine, but there is no doubt it's Ronnie throughout....this is what rock really comes down to....no MTV, no FM playlist, just the real thing.By the way, there is a live Slide On This with most of the tracks from this CD....it's got more guts to it and if you like the studio version you will probably love the real thing."
4,"Not his Best, but still good","Woody is a MASSIVELY under-rated talent, songwriter, musician, singer. Nothing comes close to ""Gimme Some Neck"" How come that album didn't take off used to baffle me; but I now realize that it was because the songs on it were too sophisticated for the average listener.A lot of his records only have a couple of songs that I like on them, and a few of them have no songs that I like on them.This record had only 2 songs that I liked: Testify & Josephine - and I was stoked to buy it brand new on vinyl back when it first came out just for those 2 great songs- and then he went and did them even better on the ""Slide on this Live"" record. The newest version of Slide-on-LIVE has a lot more material than the original release and as I recall those were the only 2 songs I liked on it."
2,Wood's Weakest,"Stretched out thin across too many guest musicians, SLIDE ON THIS seems one of those Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame all-star jams that sound good in theory but fail in practice. Wood's solo albums are far from perfect, but they're always pleasing and honest. Best when unpolished, e.g., I'VE GOT MY OWN ALBUM TO DO and NOW LOOK, SLIDE ON THIS comes across sounding like a Donald Fagen solo album.SLIDE ON THIS does have a few high points, though. ""Must Be Love,"" ""Knock Your Teeth Out,"" and ""Show Me"" especially stand out, but beyond these peaks there's little to listen for. Overall, a middling effort, but not a total loss. Like it's predecessor, GIMME SOME NECK, the second half is the strongest, but it sure takes some patience to get there."
1,WHO IS THIS SINGER,"Who is this singer, he sounds awful, I like blues, but this is something i would never buy"
5,Perfect for the DS9 fan!,"This book is essentially a transcript of the final 2-hour episode... which was nice to revisit in written form. The touching goodbyes made me teary-eyed as ever. If you are like me and really miss the best Trek show, pick this up as a souvenir, you won't be sorry."
3,Don't Waste Your Time,"Not quite as painful as Diane Carey's ""Dominion War"" books, but she fails to really get into the minds of the characters as we see them on the show. Tolerable. Read only if you are a completist -- and have read almost everything else. (I remember Diane Carey being a far better author than these three adaptions show. Maybe she's just not good with DS9.)"
3,It was a pretty good book,"The show showed the same thing. I thought I might be able to get some more out of reading the book, but did not. I finished it, so it must have been worth reading"
1,ghost from the past,"Diane, I wrote to you several years ago when""Ghost Ship"" was released. I told you about the cover graphics,remember? Your talents do not lay in the rewrites of shows. You are a creator of stories and you do it very well. Stay with your original plan to create new stories. That makes the best reading from you! The upside down Galactica on ""GHOST SHIP"", is what I wrote to you about years back,remember? Stay away from the fast stories and easy books and just be you. Your Civil War stories are a very fine read too. Best Regards: Zack"
1,"hey, let me add my ONE star to the rest!",Well. I should have read this site before buying this dumb thing
4,I like the book...but,"I noticed a couple instances in the book similar to http://www.jcandco.net/archives/2004_03.html David Schleifer's books also mentioned at http://www.maccenter.com/ The battlecruiser series shows so many things prevalent in both this book and others like it, yet it was written in the eighties."
4,Not bad for the book version of a TV show,"Carey is a good writer who gets into the heads of the characters and, I suppose readers. This novelization is well done, in my opinion. Granted, I have seen the ending a while ago, and I don't think I have watched all of it, but it seems to follow what I remember of the epizodes closely enough. Sure, I do not agree with all of the Carey's interpretations, but I enjoyed reading this novel regardless. If only Carey ended her love affair with the word ""leer"", I would have considered springing for five stars."
3,A book worth reading,"Diane Carey is one of my favorite authors. I really loved reading her books. I never saw the episode but got an opportunity to read the book. It is adequate enough to tell me what i needed to know. Not super but it's a book worth reading.Keep up the good work,Diane Carey. I wish you keep writing novelizations."
2,"well, it's better than the TV episode...","I give the book 0 stars for plot, and 2 stars for trying to compensate for the idiotic plot. Since this is a novelization, it clearly wasn't the author's fault that she was hamstringed by a bad plot, and she does make some effort to paper over the plot holes here."
1,Simply a Disgrace,"Like Equinox, Diane Carey Fouled up big time, I Wont even go into how bad this novelzation was, Hey Diane, If Your Reading, STOP NOVELIZATIONS OF EPISODES! Go Back to Writing them, Not Disgracing the fine episodes that were shown on TV....AND GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT! GET THE ENCYCLOPEDIA!"
3,A few Good Hits,"It's got All For One, Slow Down and Beatdown which brought back memories of high school parties."
5,The Best White Tea,"I am no connoisseur of white tea but I use FOOJOY SHOUMEI as the standard to compare the rest. This tea has a naturalsweet undertone that makes it a pleasure to partake. I like to just steep it to a golden yellow and savor it. Othe white teas I have tried have a slightly bitter taste,I have tried the much more expensive and similar priced ones and this beats them all hands down. White tea kills more bacteria on contact in lab studies (google it) than green so its part of my fight the flu season regime as well. Did I say the price was unbeatable? Lets keep that our little secret."
3,Floaters,"Taste is ok.Tea not so white as it darkens after brewing.Comparable to a light black tea in color and taste.The nags float,so you have to use the spoon to push it down to brew it properly.Decent price but will not buy it again.Don't recommend it if you are looking for a delicate and good light white tea taste."
1,Not as good as store bought tea bags,The packaging looks the same as the ones you can buy in Asian stores but the tea is weak and lacks the strong body of the store bought bags and it cost more. The only reason I bought it online is the local store didn't have it. But I was very disappointed in the product. Next time I will drive to Portland and buy it instead of buying a poor imitation like this
3,Grffiti World Street Art from Five Continents,I ordered Grffiti World Street Art from Five Continentsbut I have not received it?
2,Graffiti World,"The color photos are cool. It's too bad so many photo's are missed credited or listed as ""unknown"". Big mistake if your trying to catalog or archive anything especially art. This deprives the artist his place in history and the credit he deserves. It also prevented this reader from learning something new . I enjoyed the CMP and Cope stuff. Over all there wasn't enough I liked about it for me to recommend this book. The up side is I just got hip hop files and I love it :)"
4,Worldly,"I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and would recommend this for any urban artist. It captures so many excellent murals and other types of graffiti from around the world. Just when you think you've found your favorite artist, you turn the page to find another. Regardless of how you feel about scripture on walls, trains and buses, the art and freedom that exudes from each picture is awesome and beyond the descriptive word. They just are!"
5,Great book a must have,I got this book last year the WHOLE thing is art down to the cover (I had framed). It shows many styles of art from walls to ships postboxes the list would go on .........anyway great fo the end table or for ideas
5,graffiti at its best,this book is packed full of amazing graffiti from all over the world...most of my friends didnt appreciate graff until they saw this book
4,Good Gift,I bought this book for my sister on her birthday and it's awesome... but some of the art in this book is not as spectacular as I thought it would be. The book is very enjoyable regardless.
3,Ripped Cover,"The book is rad, there is better street art out there than what is in thisb book but it was still worth the purchase. It was delivered in a heshen bag with a ripped cover."
1,Graffiti World,"This book is no different than any other graff rag on the market. Just like all graff mags, all of the photos in this book were contributed from random corners of the globe. In fact the author still has a post on Art Crimes where he's encouraging graffiti artist to mail in their submissions. Strangely I didn't find any mention of this in the book (?) or maybe I was in such a hurry to get through it I didn't catch it.I found much better interntional graffiti in Graphotism's International Graffiti issue # 15 and for half the cost. This book gets 2 thumbs down."
1,No good.,"Horrible. Not happy with Seller. I never even received the book, way after it was supposed to be shipped."
5,A Great Pictorial Documentary of Street Art,"Beautiful, glossy images, with many styles and influences..."
5,Very enjoyable book.,"If what you're looking for is urban art throughout the world, that is exactly what you'll be pleased to find. I bought this as a gift for someone else, actually, but I couldn't stop looking further through its pages.I find that there are very few books like this, so when I originally discovered it I thought of what a gem it was. When I think of graffiti, I tend to think of a specific spot on the NY subway system that I've taken for years; just before heading underground the train passes by multiple buildings that have work all over the sides--it really is a beautiful sight. But I never thought about such things across the world existing, and found out in this book that they do exist.If you enjoy artwork in general, or have ever considered any graffiti to be beautiful in its own way, I would recommend this, even as a passing interest, because it will expose you to the ""world outside of your own"", in many senses of the phrase."
5,Great Product,"This book is definitely worth buying. Its a great overview of the most popular artists. Of cousr some of your favorites might be missing, it covers 5 continents! The images are stunning, I had a hard time NOT tearing them out and framing them! I keep the book on my coffee table, its a great conversation starter and my friends always enjoy looking at it."
5,Daughter loved it!,"We used this book to aid in learning about archaeology in 1st grade science. My daughter really loved this book, and even called it her favorite for awhile! It really sparked her interest in archaeology and made her decide that she wants to be an archaeologist (among several other things!) when she grows up."
4,Fun Introduction to Archaeology for Children,"I read this to my children as part of our homeschool curriculum. My students are kindergarteners and a 3rd grader. All three of them greatly enjoyed it.It is written in a style very similar to the Magic School Bus series. Like those books, there is a main body of text that can be read independently of all the little ""extras"" (dialog bubbles between the characters, side bars, charts, etc), or you can take the time to read all of the information presented. Either way works well in this book.The illustrations are bright and colorful, and the information is presented in a meaningful, yet easy to understand, manner. After reading this book, there is a sudden interest in archaeology in my house!This is a great, simple introduction. It is certainly not comprehensive, but it serves its purpose as an introductory text well."
5,"""It was Cool""",I am 10 years old and I think this was a really good book because it teaches how we learn about prehistoric man!-Brigida
3,rethink this purchase,"The Doors is one of those bands that is the stuff of legends, but if you like the band don't buy this paticular album. Look into their original albums, there are some amazing songs on them that most people haven't heard. Most everyone has heard Light My Fire, and if you like it that's great, but my favorite Doors songs most people haven't heard. Do yourself a favor, get Morrison Hotel, or any of the band's original albums. You'll be pleasantly surprised from the amazing songs you haven't heard.By the way...listen to Land Ho! I love it."
1,Forget Magic Stick.. Get the Blue One,"The blue Memory Sticks by Sony or Lexar play MP3 files just dandy. I should know, I've owned a Clie the past 2 years and I have been enjoying MP3s on my 128 MB Memory Stick since I bought my Clie.All you need to do is put the MP3s you want to listen to in the MSAudio folder on the memory stick. In fact, Sony's manual even gives instructions on how to do this! For the price of ONE Magic Gate Memory Sticks you can buy TWO blue Memory Sticks of equal size! Don't believe me, visit cliesource.com and ask all the Clie users there."
1,Music Protection????,Sony acts as if the ability to block MP3's is a virtue. Otherwise it functions like all of the other memory sticks out there.
4,Bought a CLIE? Get this or you won't have the MP3 feature.,I bought a top of the line Clie recently and all the advertising and paperwork says all you need is a memory stick. WRONG! You need THIS memory stick. Without the Magic Gate addition the MP3 software will not copy any music or sound files to your Clie for use. If you buy any music playing hardware that uses a memory stick make sure it says Magic Gate or the equipment will not work.
1,Should've stuck to photography,"While seemingly self-deprecating, this author manages to insult every culture other than her own and paint a very clear picture of herself as a spoiled, prejudiced, ignorant woman.The flagrant anti-Semitism is the worst aspect of the book, so prevalent I didn't want to finish except to see whether she'd redeem herself at all (nope), but all the troubles-with-the-incompetent-help anecdotes paint a very clear picture of an anachronistic, selfish woman who should definitely have stuck to her shopping.The worst story of all: the day a woman flagged her car down because her husband was dying of a heart attack, and the author didn't take him to the hospital because his nose was running and that disgusted her.The positive reviews excerpted in the book are all quotes from her friends and social circle who should have read it first. In sum: not worth the 1-cent used-book price."
1,I destroyed brain cells reading this book,"I was living overseas with my husband when I found this book. So, I was very excited to read something that was relevant to my own experience -- and maybe have a good laugh. Looking back, I kick myself for spending money on this book (especially the premium price charged for English language books in the country I was living). The author's observations and jokes are not only boring, but just plain dumb. After the story about trying to hire servants in India and discovering that one of the candidates had six fingers on one hand, which would make finding white gloves for him exceedingly difficult, I should have stopped reading. I kept thinking, ""You lived in all of these wonderful, exciting places, and THIS is what you took away from the experience?!"" Unfortunately, I chose to finish the book. It only got worse. Save yourself the pain."
3,funny but annoying,"I find the book has many laughs but it is also very annoying in its seemingly off-the-cuff political remarks. George Bush is of course the devil and Keenan never misses an opportunity to tell us how pro-Palestinian she is while displaying a very unappealing, old-fashioned, old school British (even though she says she's Irish) anti-Semitism. She loves Syria and disses ""Jewish moneylenders."" The fact that the fab crowd of England are used profusely in the blurbs to sell the book and their consensus is not only is this book hilarious, but also important, makes me think this smug silly attitude is acceptable in those circles. Makes one pause...."
1,"When life gives you lemons, some can only see lemons...","I loathed this book. I loathed this book so much that I binned it in the subway - with 20 minutes left to go in my journey.It is a tale of a privileged Sloane Ranger 'trailing spouse' following her husband around various diplomatic postings. With a large income, plenty of idle time and the chance to explore highly varied cultures, the life of a trailing spouse should make a pretty interesting read. Instead, the reader gets page after page of whinging, loathing and misery. Enraged at the author's haughty tone and bleak portrait of life in Central Asia, I could feel my blood pressure rising in the subway. At the interchange, I shocked fellow travellers by loudly thumping it in the bin and storming away... to make the most of my day."
3,The final phase of the Peninsular War,"Ian C. Robertson's ""Wellington Invades France"" provides a detailed account of the final year (1813-1814) of the British campaign to evict Imperial French forces from Spain and then to complete the military defeat of Napoleon by invading France. Ian Robertson is well-versed in the era and has a number of books to his credit on this general topic. This particular history is so detailed as to be a very daunting read to all but the most dedicated student of the British Army in the Peninsular War. The prose tends to be very dry, although it is supported by nicely chosen quotes by witnesses to the campaign and by clear diagrams of the actual battles. The interpretation of events is fairly standard. The casual reader without background in the Napoleonic Wars will find this a challenging read."
2,Poor Quality,The quality of the picture is very poor. Best stick to getting one from Paramount studios. This one was only worth the $5 I paid for it.
5,Excellent,This was exactly what I expected. Brand new and excellent quality. It also arrived much faster than expected. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
3,"It was the number one show, for its time","Given the level of humor, I wonder why I loved ths show and why I still can watch it with some amusement. Perhaps it's because the plots, so incredibly obvious, were based upon the simple premise that the hillbilly's did not know modern civilization. So, we thought ourselves better than them(at least). Of course, the show had a subtle message...ok, they have a lot to learn, but they also had a heart and a sincerety to them that was endearing and rock solid. So, in the end, could we depend upon them to show character or the modern day(for the time) Angelenos that they met?This collection was so inexpensive for me to get, less than $8 for over 1,000 minutes of shows, that I couldn't refuse."
3,Prett good,"SO, for 7.99, it is a pretty good collection of shows. The gripes I have range from the poor pixelation ( and I am by no means an expert or even picky to this usually) I own a bunch of old tv show series and none of them have the poor pixelation that this series does. Also, the sound and dubbing is pretty messed up on various episodes. I also wish that a few of these episodes had been the color versions. In the end, however, this is a good collection of great classic television for 7.99!"
5,AN EXCELLENT TETS PREP TOOL!,THIS BOOK WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF PREPARING FOR THE ARRT'S REGISRTY EXAM. THE BOOK INCLUDED ALL TOPICS FOUND ON THE EXAM. THE BOOK ALSO INCLUDED ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS. ALSO THE BOOK INCLUDED A PRACTICE 200 QUESTION EXAM BASED ON THAT OF THE REGISTRY. I AM PURCHASING A 2ND COPY FOR A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS ALSO TAKING THE EXAM.
1,"Nope, Not Chrome",".....and the ""plastic coated chrome-look finish"" water spotted almost immediately and couldn't be cleaned or polished into an appetizing appearance--big yuck. The horizontal style should be an improvement, however I found the filter much more difficult to remove than the older white vertical Pur I'd replaced. The final straw was last week, when an overwhelming stench issued from the filter--I'm assuming perhaps the indicator failed and somehow the filter became contaminated....I loved my old clunky vertical Pur, and I do believe overall Pur makes a good product, but this one is not it."
3,CHROME IS NOT CHROME,"This is a plastic appliance with a chrome finish. It is not made of chrome, and it, like all the other Pur filter products, will not last for very long because the plastic is prone to cracking. As a matter of fact, according to the instructions, you should not run water of more than 100 degrees through it. In other words, if you attach this gadget to your kitchen sink, your hot water cannot exceed 100 degrees. Water under 100 degrees is not very hot. The unit works, and it works pretty well, but not for very long. It is almost impossible to get more than 30 gallons out of a single cartridge."
1,Defective product and terrible customer service from PUR,"I purchased my PUR filter at Costco because I could get replacement filters in packs of 5. What I discovered is that after the first two filters, my dispenser unit started showing a red light after only a few weeks. I purchased two gallon jugs (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) and EVERYTIME I turned the filter on, filled one of the jugs & kept track of the amount of water I had filtered. I discovered after 14 gallons, the light blinked yellow, and after the 15th, turned red. I contacted PUR from their website, but I'm apparently not important enough to even respond to.As soon as I'm done with these filters, I will purchase another brand of water filter. Maybe if I encounter a problem with their product, they will respond."
2,I don't think the belt is from Gates,"I threw away the sleeve the belt had so I cannot confirm it. But I don't think the sleeve had the Gates logo on it. The belt itself does not have the Gates logo. But the description of this product on the Amazon web site says ""Gates"". I don't know why.Does Gates have manufacturing plant in Mexico? Because that is what I see on the belt I received. Also, it does not look like a Gates quality, to me."
5,tea time any time,Wish this was more widely available. Makes a wonderful tea to drink at night when you don't want to risk being kept up.
4,Dub Tractor - Hideout,"Dub Tractor continues his blend of slow, contemplative rhythms and mesmerizing harmonies with HIDEOUT. ""I Woke Up"" has the guitar-haze of a sunlight filtering through gauzy curtains, while ""I'm Like You"" is almost pop-like in its construction, though it's more like a bubble popping than anything you'd hear on the radio. The soft construction of ""Droplets,"" with bouncing guitar strums and reflecting drums, is like rainfall on a pond. The pop element is much more apparent on ""I Forgot"" and ""Faster,"" with their gentle meanderings. The title track, at the end, could almost be a lost Cocteau Twins track, but without Elisabeth Fraser's voice, unfortunately. This album wouldn't have been out of place on Morr Music, but it seems perfectly at home on City Centre Offices."
5,Track Listing,"1. Joy to the World - John Schneider2. O Holy Night - Dionne Warwick3. It Came Upon a Midnight Clear - Tony Orlando4. Everyday Should Be Christmas - Marilyn McCoo5. Deck the Halls - Neil Sedaka6. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen - Nancy Sinatra7. Away in a Manger - Billy Davis, Jr.8. Auld Lang Syne - Maureen McGovern9. O Little Town of Bethlehem - Micky Dolenz10. Gift of Hope - Mary Hart"
4,Personal,"This is a great album with a strong personal touch. The songs are really emotional - not that sappy, honey-laden fake emotion we hear too often, and not the indiscriminate, inarticulate ""everybody sucks, life sucks, I hate everything and aren't I ironic?"" kind either. (Two guesses who I'm talking about). This album is real. Sampou sings her stories like they actually mean something, and knows how to make the lyrics tell the story. Even though this isn't my usual musical cup of tea - the blues-rock with folk sensibilities and minor key guitar work doesn't really get me moving in most cases - I love this album. Buy it, and forget about the top-ten ""singer songwriter"" fakes."
1,Terrible,"I like Randy Newman. So, I purchased a cd not realizing the cd has curse words. The website needs to state whether the cd has curse words or not. Therefore, I am not very satisfied."
5,Randy Newman National Treasure,"Randy Newman is a national treasure -- severely underrated in our society as witnessed by the few reviews on Amazon for this ""Best of"" Collection. It's beyond outstanding, as is Randy, plain and simple. He is a genius if there ever was one. He'll go down as one of the best the industry has ever seen."
5,The Best of is the BEST of,If you're a Randy Newman fan as I am then this is THE collection for you. Am planning to drive from Jersey to Nevada and this will be one of the CDs keeping me awake along the way.
4,I like it,"I love Randy Newman, I like his Faust album better, but this is a wonderful collection of his best singles as well as stuff he released in other albums. Doesn't have the theme to the popular TV show ""Monk"" though."
4,Short People,"I bought this for only one song: ""Short People"". This song created a stir, and passion, in the country when it first came out, and I bought it for someone who never heard it."
4,"Great, creative music","My uncle gave me this CD and John Zorn's ""Naked City,"" after I played him Fantomas (a CD everyone should own) for the first time . Amazing. At first, I was just plain confused, but I quickly started seeing structure in the apparent chaos of this CD. Mind altering stuff...being a musician, it slightly tweaked the way I approach music. I've only heard Amazon's samples of ""Symphonica,"" but I have to go get it soon."
3,Not good for the hearing impaired,The voice is neither loud nor crisp even at the higher of the two volume settings.
3,Be Aware That This Clock Crows,"I needed a good talking clock. This one fit the bill. The voice is a bit cartoonish, but I don't mind. What I am not crazy about, is that this clock crows loudly when the alarm goes off. Who thought that was a good idea?"
1,talking alarm clock,"The clock is smalland handy--BUT--spoken times are sometimes hard or impossible to understand. Some times are garbled and the talker has trouble with fives and nines. I have had previous clocks,one for many years, and this is the most difficult to understand."
1,Talking Clock,the voice is very hard for my mom to hear and understand. she hears the hour but not the minutes.
5,Served its purpose very well,My mother was legally blind in the last years of her life. This clock was one of the tools she always relied on and had nearby. Always served its purpose.
3,"does the job, but a couple oversights","This clock works as it should. It announces the time on the hour, and on demand, when pressing the large button.That's straightforward, but there are a couple possible oversights, depending on your use.1. The volume is adjustable, but the loudest should be twice what it is.2. There are other little buttons (time set, alarm etc.) on the front panel. If someone is groping for the larger ""time-announce"" button, it's possible to press one of those others, in the process. Not a good thing, if one accidentally sets the alarm for 2:00am.3. All time is announced digitally (i.e. minutes after the hour). Some older folks don't process that as quickly as a sort of analog announcement -- e.g. ""18 minutes before 5"" versus ""four forty-two.""Bottom line, in light of the above, think about your user's issues. For an 87 year old blind person with hearing aids, this product might not make the grade, as it would for a 30 year old with perfect hearing."
4,Great clock,Bought this for my brother who recently lost his eyesight. Button is easy for him to find.
4,Perfect for the Blind,"The curve talking clock is easy to handle and easy to use. It is particularly useful for the blind who cannot use a braille clock or watch. Unfortunately, the clock is not waterproof, and when some water spilled on it, it ceased to function and could not be repaired. We then had to purchase a new one. Waterproofing the talking clock would be a big asset."
2,doesn't Serve my purpose,"Talking Clock with EZ Talk Button - SpanishI purchased the clock for my grandmother, even on the highest volume level she has a hard time hearing it. There was no way for me to test it before purchase so needless to say we'll have to get another one."
1,talking clock,"I had to return this item as it did not work. It was light weight and for a person who could not see, would be easy to knock off this hospital table. It was returned on June 3, 2011 and still have not received a credit."
5,LIFE SAVER!,"When my uncle's clock like this died we were heartbroken! We took it all over traveling with us, because the crowing sound is such a unique alarm! Also, the snooze button is big, and I love the large numbers and vocal announcement of the time. We bought 2! The shipping was fast, and we would definitely recommend this alarm clock! Runs off of batteries, but you rarely have to replace them! Very sturdy made!"
1,Impossible to set the time......,"The voice on the talking clock sounded like an angry 8 year old. I never could figure out how to set the clock and not only did the alarm go off at 3:00 am, there is a rooster crowing sound that went off also. I actually thought my neighbors got a rooster for Xmas.Save your money on this one!"
5,The Continuing Adventures of the Cabbage Patch Kids,"The junkyard gang is in for a big surprise when they challenge ""The Girls"" to a clubhouse building competition, and get more than they bargained for! Join in the fun with 4 great Cabbage Patch songs: ""Junkyard Rap"" - ""A Little Preparation"" - ""We Can Do What You Can Do"" - ""A Strawberry Milkshake""."
1,Too Wide to fit most stairs,I really like the 24 foot and this works well with outside jobs for our home on a hill. I got the 16 ft for working on interior stair and the base is too wide to fit what I assume is average staircase pitch. You could also say the problem is that the legs do not extend far enough. Either way it did not work. Measure first to be sure before you buy it. Werner should be made aware of this issue.
5,"The safest,lightest, extension Ladder","I needed a light-weight extension ladder that I could safely use on sloping ground so that I could paint my house. I had a heavy fiber-glass ladder, but it was awkward to handle and tricky and probably unsafe to place wood blocks under one leg. So I bought a 24 foot aluminum ladder from Amazon that was easy and light-weight and has the most safe means to extend either of the legs. The leg extension is not some clamp on device, but instead it is permantly built into each leg using a pin to select the length needed to compensate for the sloping ground. It is the Werner D17242EQ Equalizer 225-Pound Duty Rating Aluminum Extension Ladder with Integrated Leveling System, 24-Foot. I would definately recommend this ladder if you want a easy to handle and safe ladder."
3,Damaged product,"I think i got the broken Werner D1716-2EQ that Timothy got. The ladder is a great concept, one that I thought of years ago, but as Tim said, it arrived at my house unwrapped with a very bent lower rung and a couple of dents in other rungs. I was not a happy camper, now I must wait for UPS to pick it up and for my money to be returned. Hopefully I will not have to wait 2 weeks for the refund process to be completed."
5,Shaky Shaky,"The ladder is a little shaky when extended all the way up but you get use to it. I like the leg level, no more rocks or pieces of wood to level it. The ladder was delivered without a scratch, and it was padded at all corners. This came out cheaper than buying it from the big box store. It already paid for itself, I power washed the whole house, and cleaned all the gutters."
2,Disappointed,"Ladder arrived with 3 bent rungs!! One of them was so badly bent it is cracked. There was no packaging at all, just the bare ladder itself with the shipping label on it! That means it travelled with no protection at all..BAD IDEA AMAZON. This ladder was also scratched pretty bad, and one of the plastic endcaps was torn off exposing a deep cut in the aluminum underneathe. It also wobbles quite a bit when extended, and the leveling system is not as easy as it appears. The only good news is it is light and tall. For $300.00, I was burned. I will be returning it, but this is a hassle and I need a ladder to do my gutters. They better not give me any trouble returning it."
2,Not bad,"My first introduction to writer Steve Thayer is in the book Silent Snow. There is no question that Steve has a sense of place. He really fills in the atmosphere of Minnesota's twin cities and really engulfs you in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Unfortunately, at least for me, I felt immersed in cliche characters. The tough reporter married to the brilliant news anchor doesn't spark any originality but that's nothing compared to the background story. All the characters were dug out of a James Cagney film. The cold-as-ice broad, the dirty cop and the tough tenacious reporter with a nose for news. After a while I didn't care at all about the situations. In addition, writer Steve Thayer falls into the melodrama. ""I'm sad, I'm happy, I'm worried"" type situations give the characters no complexity or interest.If you want fluff, this isn't bad but I can't justify giving it high marks for character, story, or plot."
4,Well written....,"I read 3 of Steve Thayer's books recently, 'though not in the right order. The plot of ""Silent Snow"" has been well outlined by other readers. ""Saint Mudd"", ""The Weatherman"" and ""Silent Snow are loosely connected. You need not read them in the correct order, but it helps. ""Saint Mudd"" had the best and most believable plot. ""The Weatherman"" is the weakest of the three, with a very unsatisfactory ending. Kept me guessing to the very end. ""Silent Snow"" was a great read, but again, a very strange and unbelievable ending. However, all 3 are tense, and I lost several hours of sleep since I could not put them down."
2,"good plot, awful writing","I am in the midst of reading this book, and wanted to see what other reviews have said. Living near NJ where the original kudnapping occurred, I usually appreciated the Lindbergh story. I want to get through the book, but the writing and details are so farfetched, repititiuous, etc, I hope I can do it."
2,Not gripping,"I was disappointed in this book. The characterizations of the protagonist and his wife are so limited that I assume they must have been introduced in some earlier work, one I haven't read. Some subsidiary characters were better described, but over all the book lacked cohesiveness. The present day kidnapping was much less well developed than the Lindberg story (which was well presented) and the motivation for the current crime seems extraordinarily contrived. Moreover, unlike the Lindbergs, the husband and wife never really seemed to miss the baby!"
4,Silent Snow,"Like the others, I too guessed who it was quite soon into the story, but that didn't lesson the impact for me. It was a well written and entirely enthralling book.Unlike the others, I liked this book MUCH better than the Weatherman if only for the characterization. His portrayal of the people involved is much more interesting in this book as well as the little tidbits of history that make you want to go look up books on the Lindberg Kidnapping case.I hope to see more Thayer books out there. I hope that Ric Beanblossom and Mudd stay out of books together. I hope that poor Andrea acquires some sort of character other than that of an oversexed doormat."
4,GRIPPING AND SUSPENSEFUL,"Top investigative reporter, Rick Beanblossom has it all...a great job, a wonderful wife and a brand new baby boy.During a savage blizzard, and on the anniversary of the Lindbergh kidnapping his life will change.Someone has kidnapped Rick's son, and to find him he must retrace the original crime of the Lindbergh kidnapping, and come full circle in the present day to bring his son back alive.""Silent Snow"" is an original thriller, blending historical fact with amazing suspense, that will leave readers breathless. The pacing is fast and the plot is chilling and surprising.Steve Thayer, bestselling author of ""the Weatherman"" has taken a chance on creating a different type of suspense novel and he has succeeded.Readers looking for an intelligent thriller that will keep them turning the pages should enjoy this!Nick Gonnella"
3,Silent Snow,"I liked the Weatherman much better, but this was good reading. It did make me look up the history of the Lindberg kidnapping. The scarecrow business at the end was a little much. Whats up with that?"
2,Thayer tips his hand.,I was looking forward to Mr.Thayer's new novel Silent Snow. Richard Beanblossom was one of the most interesting sleuths to enter the suspense\mystery genre in recent years.In this novel the bizarre characterizations are still there but the plot is easily and quickly solved by the reader (by page 30). The only thing that kept me reading until the end were the interesting references made in the storyline to the Lindberghs.
3,"Item great, but had problems","When I received this item it did not have the power cord. I contacted the company that shipped it and was told they do not have spare parts, but I could contact Optoma. After doing so, the only response I received was that someone from customer service would contact me in 24-48 hours, and I was never contacted. I tried three times to get the power cord with no luck. I was given the opportunity to return the projector, but decided to keep it becuase I had spent so much time researching the item and it works great! I would recommend the projector to anyone, but beware if you do not receive everything that is listed."
5,"Welcome back, Mr. Holmes.","I was pleasantly surprised to catch this on PBS the other night. I approached it with serious skepticism, believing that no other actor could ever come close to portraying Sherlock Holmes as well as the great Jeremy Brett did. Rupert Everett did an outstanding job here! His portrayal is a bit similar to Brett's in some aspects, but he also brings his own unique style and characteristics to the role. The rest of the cast seemed fitting, and the director manages to recreate the period quite nicely. The story is actually pretty good... Not great, but good. The film is so well directed that it works out to be a most enjoyable Holmes mystery.I really hope that this will be the first of many new Sherlock Holmes adventures starring the very talented Rupert Everett!"
2,Not quite the bottom of the barrel,"The best thing that can be said about this handsomely produced Sherlock Holmes imitation is that it isn't the worst that's come out lately. Not half as bad as, for instance, ""Sherlock: Case of Evil"" or the gawdawful adaptations of Doyle's stories with Matt Frewer as Holmes. But it's pretty bad. Emphasis (as has become a clichÃ©) on Holmes's substance abuse, particularly in the beginning. But the most astonishingly bad thing about the story is a particular plot twist which, of course, I may not reveal, but which is one of those which no good writer would ever exploit as a surprise solution."
2,Don't Bother,"I always appreciate attempts at recreating Sherlock Holmes. As a huge fan of the stories, this movie definitely falls short. Contrary to the stories, Watson is portrayed as a fumbling idiot rather than a war veteran. Even the plot is lacking. A solution that has been done countless other times. Honestly, I found the BBC television worth more merit and true to the original stories than this.Appreciate the effort; but it just didn't cut it. I want to like it so bad...but it just doesn't happen with this one. The acting is poor and the story line is terrible. Very sad to see a classic fall short."
1,Simply Dreadful...,"Rupert can be such a funny and wonderful actor--e.g. in the recent magical version of AN IDEAL HUSBAND. But Oscar Wilde is not Arthur Conan Doyle. And, Rupert, you are no Jeremy Brett here. Not that he really had to be. But to play Sherlock--pastiche or not--with absolutely no intensity, no intellectual vigor, no excitement--is to kill the main characteristics of Holmes. Rupert seems to be slumming here--lots of posing and looking mournful--and makes the detective the last thing he should be...ordinary.A well-mounted production in many senses. Good character actors in support. A modernized story with fingerprinting and sexual perversion. But, without a believable Holmes, who cares? To make matters worse, Watson and Holmes seem much too young here. Watson is too short. And the relationships among Holmes, Watson and Mrs. Hudson are nowhere near as close and warm and devoted as they should be.This production is just terribly misbegotten."
3,Sherlock Holmes and the case of the silk stockings,As Sherlock Holmes go this was okay. Did not like the actors as well as some that I have seen.
2,Worst Holmes film I have seen so far,"Arthur conan Doyle never delt with such crude subjects. I didn't like Everetts Holmes, he was creepy and rude. Watsons fiance was also crude. Watson was wimpy. After seeing all of the Brett and Rathebone movies I was excited about a ""new Holmes"". Good thing there isn't a series of these. Even the cartoons are way better."
2,Watch Jeremy Brett instead,"Despite its lavish costumes and good score, this production can do nothing to mask its poor casting. As the title role, Everett is awkward and frenzied . . . not like the cool, calculating Holmes we all know- he seems less like a brilliant (and frightening) genius and more like a raving drug-addict. (Not to mention the terrible violin scene...) The script does little to capture the spirit of the Conan Doyle stories.Take my advice and watch Jeremy Brett instead. Or better yet, go read the books."
2,Not Jeremy Brett,"This is not Jeremy Brett, and as such it can never be a great version of Sherlock Holmes. But if you have to settle for less than the best it is not horrible. It is also not a story that Doyle wrote; it is an original screen play using Doyle's character. Which is why the plot sort of does this kind of flop on the descent toward the finale. Keeping these things in mind, it's ok."
4,Pretty Good Homes,I enjoyed this movie. It's not the best Sherlock Holmes movie and I've seen quite a few. But Everett was no Brett. He wasn't trying to be.Now if Brett had not played Holmes people would be giving it five stars.And for the Cocaine Doyle had Holmes using it in some of the Early Books. As at the time Cocaine could be bought from almost any Drugstore.So I guess you either like this verson or you hate it.I like it for the references to the occurances in the first books.And Doyle would have been lynched if he used the sexual killings in his stories.
2,Not thumbs up; Not thumbs down,"It was great to see a new Sherlock, even though this Sherlock was very unSherlockian. He had the wrong guy detained, recklessly endangered a girl, and just seemed to be too much of a slacker. But, it is good to see any effort in the post Brett world. We need new Sherlocks -- as imperfect as they may prove to be."
1,I was very disappointed with the product.,"It did not fit as well as the original. It stuck out slightly and did not bed down into the rubber seals. Also the wiring for the bulbs was wrong: the amber light stayed on all the time and none of the bulbs worked as in the brake light, turn signal, etc. Only the the casing was damaged on the original so in the end the only way I could get it to work was to use the new casing and subsititute my old circuit board and bulbs for the new one. So I basically payed for the casing as the new circuit board/ bulbs did not work."
5,Murder in Portland was a good movie,"There must be something in the water in Larado, TX. I thought the movie was well made and the acting was very good. I can see where some might not like the subject matter. Most of these people don't have lives and all they can do is dish on other people work. This movie is a great buy for $30 and a steal at the used price. The folks who made this film must be doing something right they have 4 movies out and seem to be selling. I some think that anti-gay people are writing thes reviews to get people not to buy gay movies. This is a great little movie and well worth the money."
1,?????,"No- really... did i just sit through this? i'm afraid so. and i'd like to warn anyone who hasn't yet--not to. This was probably one of the first times i bought a dvd because of the reviews.And it will be the last. C'mon people! did we watch the same movie? All of the actors were unattractive, except for the undercover cop, the runaway looked 14 years old. watching him have sex with the store owner was brutal. And the editing was so choppy and noisy that i had a migrane 20 minutes into it.Forget about the fact that i spent 30 bucks on this. I am very bitter. How can anyone have the balls to sell this? let alone make this movie. i laughed outloud several times during this film, and not because it was funny but because i couldnt beleive the lack of talent involved with this. Really, it was that bad. sorry....."
1,"Maumee, Ohio please crawl out of your hole","Many people enjoy films because they allow us an escape...no one would deny that. But only a simple-minded lunkhead could enjoy such a worthless piece of dretch as Murder in Portland. And only a simple-minded lunkhead would try to ravage the integrity of a reviewer simply because he/she didn't enjoy a film, especially one of such low quality. You don't have to be a tired queen to know that this film is the pits. You only have to be a tired queen to accuse someone else of being one.If your name is Biff...this movie may be for you. If you have any type of criteria by which you qualify a film, you'll throw this out of the window after viewing it."
1,No stars are too many stars!!!!,"If you are a true masochist, into heavy-duty self-flagellation, and if after you have beaten yourself to a bloody pulp, you still believe that you have not endured enough agony and pain - watch ""Murder in Portland"". On behalf of the State of Washington as well as for the benefit of its entire gay and lesbian community, a truly perfect selfless act of kindness would be to never allow Gael Richards to direct another film, to permanently pad-lock the studio door of Richard Anthony Films Production, and to burn the original negative as well as every copy of ""Murder in Portland""."
5,How Little We Knew by Dee Miller,"Dee Miller did an excellent job in capturing the emotions that a victim of clergy sexual misconduct goes through with this excellent book. In her honesty about the horrific sitiuation that she, herself had to endure at the hands of her perpetrator and then that of the governing church body, was emotional but yet educational. This is a must read for all church leaders, regardless of denomination. It becomes an educational tool when one sees how a situation was so very mishandled, but then can learn from these devastating mistakes. Yet it becomes an even more powerful book of suppport for fellow clergy sexual misconduct victims, when one may very well see written on paper, the emotions he/she may be feeling as well. Ms. Miller is able to articulate on paper, what other survivors may have been experiencing as well regardless of the denomination. A must read for clergy sexual misconduct victim/survivors and for all leaders of any faith communities."
3,Some good stuff,This book was o.k. It follows Jung and Freud very well. There are a lot of symbols meanings available. I had trouble relating many of the meanings to me and my dreams. One good thing was that its not one of those books that tell you your fortune or what's in the future. Also it has a good introductory about important aspects of dreaming.
2,Mediocre,"The introduction is somewhat comprehensive, aiming to cover the main dream theories. The dictionary, however, is very basic, lacking major symbols like elevator and providing very rudimentary explanation about other important symbols, such as theft, bag, etc.Overall, the explanations lack depth. As such, the book might be a good start, but it's not suitable for people who are looking for serious comprehension of dream symbols."
2,Okay,"I had average expectations for this book. I understand that different Psychologist have different ideas about dreams and what not, but when I read this book and compared it to others it didn't make a whole lot of sense. It has a few accurate descriptions . Another weird thing I noticed was just about every dream symbol in this book seemed to somehow be translated to possibly meaning something sexual. Liker EVERY other one. I found that strange."
3,THE GUY WHO WROTE THIS WAS A VICAR.HE LIVED IN MY HOUSE,"ok this sounds weird but the guy who wrote this book was a previous owner of the house i live in, both me and my partner were having weird intense dreams not long after we moved in, then we get a box of these books delivered to my house, and reconied the name, he was a local vicar, the neighbours told me he went slightly mad?..the book didnt really explain too much about the murdurous dreams i was having, but just found the whole thing a bit weird....."
5,Of special note...,"This is a great CD set. I love Andrew Parrott's understanding and appreciation of this musical highlight. Emily Van Evera's appearance here is exceptional and I am constantly in awe of the tone quality in her voice. The only, only drawback to this recording is that Parrott occasionally uses a guitar as part of the continuo in place of a contrabass. This touch seems more historically based, but my modern ears prefer the basso continuo. Other than that, this recording is a gem!"
1,GARBAGE,THIS ITEMS GETS TO HOT WITHIN AN HOUR OF JUST SITTING THERE AND FELL OFF THE DESK ACCIDENTALLY VERY LIGHT FALL AND BROKE ONLY HAD LESS THAN 2 MONTHS. SHOULD BE TOUGHER THAN THAT!
2,Design detracts from content,"While the content is mildly interesting (though not particularly original), the fonts/layout make it difficult to read."
3,"Not enough history, too many stats. Pharmer's Almanac.","I read this book under the impression that it was going to be a history of the band and its members. The story was too brief and the facts were unnecessary, if I want statistics I'll read the Pharmer's Almanac."
4,"PHISH in text, Just as good as LIVE",Mr. Budnik does a great job describing the wonders of the band Phish. He explains each song in depth including all covers. The set lists in the back are a great supplement but not needed due to the real Phish Phan already owning a copy of the Pharmer's Almanac. Anyways it has a great history section and a must for anyone who loves music. Phish is one of a kind and so is this book.(Dustin C. Blumenthal)
2,"Cute idea, but only get it if you have the rest","If you're a Phish fan who already owns all the other books about the band, you'll want to read this one, too. Dean has some good insight here and there, and was the first to get a book about hte band off the ground. But this is really just one guy's take, its wrought with errors (typographical and grammatical, leave aside factual for now), and it's years and years old. There are a half dozen newer and more complete books, including the all-for-charity Phish Companion and the multi-volume Almanac."
5,PLEASING AND BEAUTIFUL,I have enjoyed this precious book. It is beautifully done. The artwork is something else and the story is choice.
4,Miss Hunnicutt's Hat by Jeff Brumbeau illustrations by Gail de Marcken,A very good children's book. The message of the need to be accepting is well presented. The illustrations are interesting and very colorful.
4,Atomic Opera - Penguin Dust,"The album starts with ""Make a God""---it basically kicks you in the face with it's heavy groove and continues through all kinds of facets... The chordal/music structures stick and seem to weave between the sounds and elegance of Allan Holdsworth, mixed with the guts of King's X, flavored with the energy of the Galactic Cowboys. Frank Harts vocals sounds like a mix of Chris Cornell and something you can't put your finger on. If you like soulful and gutsy singing, this is for you. If you want a variety of the groove, instead of the same old bag of junk, check out Atomic Opera and give yourself something of a new sensation. Don't deny what your ears have yearned fo. You bes not be disappointed!"
1,Dated material,His style is reminiscent of the old crooners like Bing Crosby. The songs don't benefit from his style of delivery. He should be bringing a new style to them.
4,Men love this fragrance,I initially thought this product was too strong but there was something about it I liked. My boyfriend LOVES this scent on me- so does every man I pass. That makes this scent a keeper
5,intriguing subject with driving plot,"Really found this a fascinating topic, particularly since the author is a face finder herself."
2,Trico Exact Fit Wiper Blade,"Well the blades work great at first but only last less than a year. When you buy the whole piece set is very easy to install, literally in seconds but the actual blades don't last that long."
5,MUST have in my Library.,Excellent reference on how the law works--and doesn't! I will keep this handy for review in the future. You should too.
2,overpriced,while the item was in good shape the seller was way overpriced. Item showed new price of $7.95 and charged me $20.00 for it. Seller was taking advantage of an out of stock item.I've always had a problem with these kinds of selling tactics.
4,What.....No Stevie????,"Stevie Wonder has to be the epitome of stylistic uniqueness among song writers, African-American or otherwise. He is also one of the most proliferate, with a body of work that spans nearly 4 decades. The influence of his genius upon the music world is unquestionable. How, then, could this musical phenomenon been omitted from an otherwise outstanding collection?"
3,No James Brown???,They really have a History of Black Music Compilation and leave out James Brown? No James Brown? Uh...what's going on here? One of the most important figures in music of this century and he's excluded...for shame
1,What is this book really about,Reading the back of this book one would think that the stories would be interesting. Boy am I sorry that I even bought it. All three stories at least mention the scandal about the gentically experimented children that were adopted out but that was it. None of the people in the stories were involved in the scandal. The stories involved matchmaking grandmothers.
1,Truth in advertising?,"I have to agree with the previous review. The blurb on the back of the book is TOTALLY misleading. If you're looking for something like what the book is supposed to be..try Iris Johansen's ""Last Bridge Home"" or Kay Hooper's ""Evil"" trilogy."
2,Terrible transfer,"I was very pleased to see that all of Eva Braun's home movies have finally been released on DVD, but I was GREATLY dissapointed upon viewing each of the 3 volumes. The video transfer could not be worse. The same film clips which always appeared vivid and well balanced colorwise in all other places I've seen them are often amazingly dark or washed out. If I could find the web address of the manufacturer of these discs I would ask how they were able to take such good quality film and ruin it so completely. It looks like third or fourth generation source films were used. A total waste of time and money. I'm hoping someone else releases a complete version of these films that we could at least see clearly. AWFUL VIDEO QUALITY."
2,"I agree, terrible transfer!",Many scenes in this video are very dark. It is sometimes hard to make out where people are standing and chatting. I have seen some of the footage in these home videos in many other documentaries and they really do come out much sharper.They must rerelease this archived material again with better picture quality!
1,"Yes History Fan , Terrible transfer !!!!!!!!","I agree with History Fan ,, what he said at 2004 is correct and i can't say more ... this DVD collection is no more than a third or fourth generation VHS source films and it could not be worse in quality .."
2,Not compatible with all memory stick readers,"Be careful when buying a memory stick that is non-Sony. Some may work great. However, I bought the Lexar translucent 128 mb. It worked fine in my camera, but I have significant problems downloading the images with my Dazzle 6 in 1 reader. I have spoken directly with Lexar and Dazzle product support. Lexar has admitted some problems and Dazzle also said that some of Lexar's memory sticks are non Sony compatible. Rather than try to save a few dollars, it is worth it to stick with the Sony memory sticks unless you are sure the brand works with your particular reader."
4,Excellent device (so far),"I purchased the Lexar memory stick for my Sony Vaio PC. I also purchased a Sony PCMCIA Memory Stick Adapter (MSAC-PC2) for my IBM Thinkpad 600E. The adapter worked fine, was recognized instantly by XP, and now I can transfer large amounts of data back and forth among my laptop and my home PC without any problem.XP recognizes the memory stick about the same as when you insert a CD--it pops up a dialog box asking you what program to use to view the new media."
3,Standard quality but LED waste power,"Hi,I have a Sony DSC-P71 Cybershot that I use with this memory stick. The memory stick has a LED that light's when it writes. But when it is inside the Cybershot you can't see it. And the Cybershot has it's own LED anyway. So I think this memory stick is wasting batery life.Thank-you"
2,Not Durable,"And my little guy is NOT a destroyer. But my little guy LOVES it. So, buying another one. Maybe one day they will make it with more tear resistant fabric."
1,Not a strong toy,This toy lasted less than 5 minutes with our minature schnauzer. Our dog tore the covers off the little balls with absolutely no problem.
5,I've been waiting for this!,"I've been waiting for a band like BDL to come along...they have the perfect blend of energy, intensity, great songs, incredible lyrics, vocals, acoustic guitar...everything! Every song sounds different, says something different. I can't stop spinning this CD!"
5,Tremendous!,I heard Big Dumb Love play about a year ago. It was an amazing performance. I am ecstatic that other people across the nation are finally able to share the experience that I had.
3,Pretty Good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"People don't give Ebony the props she deserve. She is a good artist but sometimes she dosn't rap to the beat. Her album was actually good. You will only skip 3 songs. The rest of the album is hot. This ia a pretty good debut album by a female rapper and Ebony Eyez deserves to be heard. I would really suggest you hear the album before u buy it though, then maybe you can decide. I'd give her a chance. Also check out Trina's Glamorest Life, that's the stuff right thurr, right thurr. HAHA!!!! Check this CD out though."
4,this girl shoyuld have blown up,she was'nt messing with the right people surely la reid was smoking crack to turn her down but still ebony is one of the better female rappers i heard in a minute but she's slept on this is a hot cd maybe she should have woerked with nelly.
5,Just as described and on time,"This are a nice shoes for a girl, I bought they for my sister and she was very pleased. Please don't send my any physical advertising."
1,"got this for my girlfriend who is hawaiin, its totally off base I used to live in hawaii for years","stupid book written by a lazy author, dont waste your time, might as well be a 1st graders book its got so few words in it"
5,Dis haole's goin bak home,I grew up in Hawaii and really miss talking pidgin. I can't wait to show my family why I say things that they have NEVER hear of. Like hanaokalele broke your okalele:)
5,Ho' Brah!,Choke pidgin in dis' book eh. Mo' books den kalihi! haha! definitely a must have fo' wen go learn speak bird! shoots!
3,Hawai'ian Pidgin,If you are a haole and do not have a Hawai'ian friend this book does not make much sense. Some of the more self explanitory things were somewhat funny.
4,"Nice, but too short.","Overall good story. The usual young lady falling in love with a ladies' man 10-15 years older. Abby is portrayed as innocent but not stupid. Calhoun is the usual tough, not wanting marriage man. However, I think it was a little too rushed at the end. Out of nowhere Calhoun comes and offers Abby marriage. Not a surprise of course, but I still think it lacked a little closure. Also, there were other characters involved with too much information on them. Good story, but needed more to be great."
5,This book was great,"This book made me laugh.Though the ending isnt great and it isnt as good as Evan(also by Palmer)it's worth reading.The drinking scene when Abby and Justin are drunk was just so well wrote I could picture it in my mind.I also hope you read Ethan and Evan which are wrote in similarity and refer to one another once or twice in each book.I love this series but please read the reviews for other Palmer books before you buy them,Palmer's later books are a little boring.But I give this series 5 stars."
2,Worst one I've ever read,"Love Ms.Palmer but this one was not good. Abby was really immature for a twenty year old. There was to much conflict between them during the entire book and she kept trying to get back at Calhoun. One minute she loves him the next she's trying to forget him, that was really tiring, it was like make up your mind already. In the end I really didn't care if they got together."
1,Bad customer service,"I purchased a see-thru hard case for my new MacBook Pro. The description said that it fits all 15"" Macbooks. It didn't fit mine (the box my computer came it said it was 15"", but it really is 15.4""). I called the company to get a return authorization and got a message telling me to email the request. Well I have emailed them 3 times over 3 weeks and have not received anything back-no ""we're busy, we'll get to soon"", no nothing. This is no way to treat a customer-"
1,AWFUL COMPANY/ DO NOT SUPPORT THEM/Misleading/Poor customer service!,"DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE A MACBOOK PRO MADE IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. I was not aware of this when I searched "" macbook pro case 15"""" which is the aluminum model that most people have. When I took it out and see that it didnt fit my macbook, I contacted them and received no response. Then after a couple days I contacted them again. They told me they wouldnt not take it back. One of their ""return policys"" is that they dont except any returns on this product if the shrinkwrap is taken off -- thats the ONLY way you can see if it fits your computer! What garbage. Oh, and they dont cover return shipping--basically they've found every loophole to steal your money. Now I spent $30 on a case that doesnt work. Money down the drain. I will contact amazon to let them know about this misleading ad."
1,Great case - didn't fit,"This case was exactly as promised with one major exception, it didn't come close to fitting my new 15"" macbook pro (purchased 7/09). The seller was great and I returned it. Apparently the new Macbook pro's are a little bigger. They don't have one to fit the new style Macbook and that's too bad because otherwise the case was great, both sturdy and stylish. I got this one at a discount because it had been opened and I imagine the same thing had happened to the previous buyer."
4,MacBook Pro Hard Case,"Fits nicely, all plugs, ports, etc. are accessible with the cover on the computer. Does have a couple of rough/sharp edges, but they generally don't interfere unless you bump it from the side. Vents in the bottom allow heat to escape so computer doesn't get too hot."
1,Get Incase Instead.,"This is a hard cheap polycarbonate that cracks easily and doesn't fit correctly. The only thing it has going for it is that it is orange. Get the Incase instead, it lets you have access to the battery check button on the bottom, has more ventilation holes on the bottom, a nice non slip feel, and it is flexible and more durable, and it fits. Just wish it came in more colors."
3,MacBook Pro See-Thru Case,"I was a little disappointed with the fit of the case. Even after fitting it on, to open the case requires a lot more effort, I have to turn the case up to get to the button. Maybe I'll get use to it since I only had the case for a week, but a butoon extention would have been appropriate. I'm confident that it will provide greater protection for the laptop, but would only give it a ""2"" for value. For nearly $50, I expected more."
1,MacBook Hard Case,Bad Customer Service by AMAZON.COM. I have asked AMAZON in several occassion to let me return this item since I got the wrong case for my daughter's MACBOOK but AMAZON has ignored my requests for a refund !!!!
3,Protects well but has 2 major problems - Dust magnet and Electric Static Shocks,"Although I no longer use this with my MBP, it did protect my computer from bumps and kept it looking new. The Speck case does scratch easily on normal surfaces too. Aside from being overpriced, there are two major problems with it, that have forced me to remove it permanently from my laptop.The case attracts a plethora of dust which is never good for computers. To combat this dust magnet problem I put the entire unit inside an InCase sheath which costs about $35-40. However upon removal from this sheath, static electricity would build up on the Speck case and shock me as well as the laptop. Electric shocks are NEVER a good thing for expensive computer equipment. The only way to prevent this was to touch part of the metal on the computer to ground it. Another way to.prevent this is by leaving only the top cover of the Speck case on to protect the rear of the LCD screen."
5,Great Product for MacBook Pro,"The Speck Macbook Pro 15"" See-Thru Hard Case fits my MacBook Pro perfectly. I was nervous about purchasing the product but once I received it and installed it I was impressed with the product. Definitely dresses up my MacBook Pro quite a bit. Good product!"
4,Awesome Design and Excellent Protection,"In very few words, it gives your Mac a renewed & good-looking design and, at the same time, it offers an excellent protection against dust, fingerprints or scratches.It fits just perfectly and preserves the original shape of the laptop.Awesome !!!"
2,Hussam Alhuzaimi,Cool looking but not the case is not that hard enough to avoid scratches especially the black color
5,"Snappy cover, works fine.","We have two Speck covers on MacBook Pros, and two more on MacBooks.The oldest is twenty months (back when mainly red was available), now we distinguish our computers with a variety of colors. No problems after repeatedly taking them off and on (batteries and memory problems.I recommend it to most Mac Notebook users. We have none of the typical scratches and dings we've seen on previous computers.Jay"
5,Great product,I purchased this cover to protect my MacBook Pro after it was scratched going through airport security. It installs with ease and really dresses up the otherwise boring aluminium finish.
3,"Fair protection, but expensive...","Fair protection. You may like the color. I don't. Not enough shock absorption. Actually none I think. You may be disappointed because of the quality of the product when you open the box, but it works. It still feels like a cheap $20 case."
2,Overheating an issue,"The manufacturer claims that the vents allow for adequate ventilation. I used the case for 1 month without an issue, but today experienced performance issues associated with overheating. I removed the case, the MacBook was noticeably cooler shortly afterwards, and the issues went away. I can't be certain that the case was to blame but overall, I don't think the price is worth it, and I don't feel confident enough in the ventilation to ever use the case again.Also, the case changes the weight of the balanced screen, making it move due to accidental shifting more so than if the case is not on the computer.I took off the case right before logging into amazon to write this review, and for the first time today, the computer is not hot to the touch, so I'm pretty confident the case is to blame."
5,love love love,"If you are looking to protect your computer and add a little color into your life, this is your product!!! I always get compliments on my computer. But I am more concerned with how thick the plastic is to protect my hard earned investment... Sleek, strong, stylish. BUY IT!!"
3,Nice but not issue-free...,"I wish they would say it does not fit the newer models. I just bought a new MBP and purchased this to protect it. It fits great, but the bottom covers all the ports,rendering them unusable. Oh well, at least the top half fits."
3,Modification needed,"The case fit my Macbook Pro well, except that when I would lift the screen, the top half of the case would snag on the bottom half at the right hinge, lifting it off the computer. As another reviewer mentioned, this can be fixed by shaving off a little of the Speck's plastic, but for such an expensive item this should not be necessary."
1,Web order page needs work??? Order by phone for right item.,"The product looks ok however when ordering online the choices are vary hard to determine for application then when you get the wrong item, you have to pay to ship it back at your expense and they if you want the correct item it is double the cost!!! Go figure! I personally will not be a returning customer."
1,Horrible Service,"Horrible Service. The covers do not fit most mac book pros and they are terrible about giving you your money back. I would not reccommend this company to anyone! In fact, I am warning you against them! No wonder they try to be cheap! Horrible quality~!"
1,MISLEADING! Doesnt fit!,I purchased this case using my iPhone so I never saw the small print that says it wont fit my MacBook Pro that it only would fit older models. Why on earth dont they tell you that right in the title? What a waste of money! The company never returned my request for a return and I see that they will charge me 30% re-stocking fee + return shipping to send it back! I'm furious! What horrible a customer service solution to an issue THEY could have avoided with proper marketing!
5,Pimping your MacBook Pro and protecting it at the same time,I am using this Speck product now for some months and am very happy with it.In the beginning I had to 'shave' a bit along the front and sides of the case to remove some sharp edges but now I cannot even remember my Macbook Pro without it.It is easy to install and once it is on it is doing a great job giving my Macbook Pro some extra protection.On top of protecting my computer it looks great as well. It is almost like pimping my computer and when I open up my computer in a group I always get questions about how I got my computer looking that great.I recommend this case to all who want to protect their computer.In my bag I tend to have an additional neoprene case around it in a my case as I travel by plane regularly where people are less careful when they try to squeeze their too big over sized bag in the small overhead bin.
4,"Fits like a glove, but I think I have fat fingers.","The top portion fits perfectly but the bottom one doesn't. I got a second one to check and it does the same thing. This leads me to believe that it's my MBP that's slightly off. Other than that, it's perfect."
5,Terrific investment in a Mac Book Pro - a Speck case,"I first learned of Speck cases for Macs from my brother-in-law, who found them to be a worthwhile investment in the higher cost and better quality of a Mac laptop. So, after buying a 15"" MacBook Pro, I purchased a clear Speck case. I am very pleased. Installation was a snap ... pardon the pun ... and the case definitely protects the nice aluminum case of the Mac. The case fits snugly. My brother in law had issues with an earlier model of case: the DVI plug could not be fully inserted into the laptop side because the Speck case prevented a snug fit. Current models fix that problem by simply leaving that side of the case open. Much improved. My only complaint about the case is that dust and debris tends to collect down in the case near the edges of the laptop. But, that's a small price to pay for protection. And the clear case looks great on the high-end Mac Book Pro. Buy one."
3,"Good, but not great.","This speck case does wonders for the macbook pro visually, but I had some initial problems with it. It didn't quite fit so the back corner chipped off. Also, I was saddened to know that dirt and grime get in your case even though you have a case on it and it scratches the Macbook Pro. It's still pretty good though because I know I'd have way more scratches on it if I didn't have this case on. I hear Incase's new one is also nice and it's softer so it won't scratch. Either one I guess you'll do fine with."
3,Excellent but expensive!,"This product is definetly the best way to protect your macbook pro from scratches,I bought the orange one and its really sweet it brings a cool look to mbp.Its easy to put it on it took me only 30 seconds to start using it..But I dont think this simple plastic cover is worth 40 dollars and I feel like I wasted my money..."
2,Would be great if it was usable,"I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop. Everytime I opened the lid a POPPING sound would occur. Turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing. I took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed, same issue.I'm not telling anyone not to buy this product. Just be cautious.. and I hope you have better luck then I did."
1,It TOTALLY scratched my MacBookPro!,"As soon as I bought my new MacBookPro about 7 months ago, I decided to purchase one of these covers to protect it against scratches. (Bought the red one) Unfortunately this product has done more damage than good, because it has scratched my ""baby"" around the edges so bad, that I'm thinking I might not be able to resell my MBP without having to give a big discount. I'm going upload a video review to show you what I mean. It is specially bad on the back left and right sides, close to the hinges. I'm SO disappointed with this product, because even if I don't use this product anymore, the damage have been done!!!"
4,Pretty Good,"Case arrived a little scuffed up, but not bad. Lower portion needs to be filed w/ nail file for smooth opening. Good purchase and product otherwise."
5,Great Protection,"I've used this case for about 6 months now. It provides great protection for your machine. I don't have to worry about anything getting scratched anymore.At first, I was worried about heat dissipation, but some tests and keeping an eye on the temperature gauge I have no worries anymore.The case is also a real eye-catcher. I've had people ask me where I got the red mac and had to point out that its a case.The only bad experience I've had with the case was with the plastic that holds it on. A piece of the clip broke off that hold the bottom left corner on. I haven't had a problem with it coming loose though despite the broken piece."
1,JUNK!,"Within a couple months my ""protective"" case was split, cracked, the rubber feet lost, etc.. under normal use and without any falls or drops of the computer.Simply made of cheap junk plastic, for $49!!!!"
2,cheap plastic shell.,Removed it from my Macbook Pro after two weeks. Makes your Mac look like a cheap laptop.
4,Great product. Tight fit.,Perfect fit for the Macbook Pro. One of the best cases around. Really nice color selection. Only downfall is some dust accumulation but besides that is a very good quality product.
4,Great Cover,"Great protection, perfect fit, easy installation. The only complaint is the color. I have a grey macbook pro so the color doesn't quite pop like a white macbook would."
5,Cannot ask for better,"I got the Red one and it snapped into my 15"" Macbook Pro easily. I have just had it for 2 days now so I cannot say anything about dust getting in the case and scartching the notebook. But as far I can see, there is no way dust is going to get in coz it is snapped real close. It also looks real stylish. Now I can stick my Ferrari stickers on the case. Awesome"
1,Stupid Purchase,"This product costs over $40 and is less worthy than a grocery store fruit container, really, which is given away. It's not plastic as people say in their reviews, but it's made of a thin acrylic which makes it pretty fragile for what it is intended to be."
3,Different! I must admit.,"Have only played it a few times, but some of the arrangement are pretty wild! I can just about pick out the melody, which is what I like to do. However, It is clear to see that Mr. Cables and his crew are extremely talented musicians, so I must not simply put it aside.....I will keep listening, and I know it will continue to grow on me."
1,Badly organized,"This book lacks a thorough description of grammar, choosing to selectively omit concepts when the author fiunds it too difficult to tackle. The reader is them left to figure out those concepts by himself because they were too hard to explain -- go figure! The book is also using words not explained in the glossary, and the exercises need words that have not been introduced. The CD does not cover all dialogues. The book does not have a comprehensive overview of declensions or conjugations in the running text, and I was missing a place to find declensions of pronouns etc."
5,WOW!!,"Enough said...well almost! This is the best neuro-ophth review book out there. My neuro score on the OKAPS sky rocketed after I read this book. The BCS book stinks, but this book rocks. So easy to follow and review you will wonder why you ever wasted your time with any other book. The book is organized into very high yield bullet points that really pinpoint exactly what you need to know and none of the filler that you don't care about. Diagrams are easy to follow. No real pictures is the drawback, so will need an atlas or the like for pics. The section on visual fields was amazing! If neuro is your weak point (it was mine) or a strength, this book will help you regardless."
4,good one !,"you need this one. loaded with info, small, current and high yield. the price makes the value exceptional. it does fall short on the explanation side, so it is not a reference text in any way but it is a great review manual."
5,Touching Story,"Very nice, heartfelt account of a moment in time that few experience. The extrapolations provided are meaningful and worth reading. Thank you. It gave me something to ponder."
3,Good Old Movies,"The Gene Autry/Roy Rogers DVD I ordered and played was good, typical of his movies. However, it would be very helpful if more information could be displayed BEFORE ordering videos. That is, if they are B & W and the year they were made. Not enough information is available so that the purchaser would know the titles of the movies on the DVD in case they already would have them in their library."
4,Top Chef Season 2,"Another Great season although I believe Marcell was Robbed..I have never seen another contestant treated so unfairly..The winner (imho) should have been eliminated when the other contestant was...Anyway, that aside, there is a lot of creative input and is very entertaining to watch..There are plenty of good characters and situations..Please hurry up and release all these seasons on dvd...Thankyou..."
3,It's all about the bus...,"I was going to call this season a train wreck, but I think a bus wreck is more appropriate. There are bodies under the bus every episode. If you enjoy the carnage, this season is for you! Unprofessional, mean spirited slackers, the lot of them. In 9 seasons this group is the worst, but the drama is extreme, think ""Housewives"" in chef's coats, but like most wrecks, it's hard not to watch."
4,"Great show, but this season's contestants are irritating","I am a big fan of Top Chef, but contestant Betty makes this season almost unwatchable. The winner is also pretty hard to like. But, the challenges are interesting, and there's always a twist! This is fun for cooks and avid eaters alike."
4,Good Sharpener,These burs work well. I had long used the rotary sharpening stones and these are better. I used the first bur in a small pneumatic die grinder and it did not hold up under the high speed. I read another review which talked about keeping the speed down on a rotary tool. This is neccesary and should be part of the package instructions. Another vendor of a similar bur with an angle guide suggests using it with a power drill. The drill is a bit clumsy but is handy for field use. I am now using one saw with a carbide chain for cutting railroad ties and these diamond burs are probably the only inexpensive way to sharpen the carbide inserts.
4,Worked for me,"Much easyer to use than a file. The life of these were a little less thanI would have liked. Evan so, I like the perfomance as far as sharpening andmaintaining my chain saw."
4,guide not needed,"I purchased these burrs to use with the chain saw guide tool - which is no longer available. However, I discovered, that by aligning my Dremel tool with the angle of the saw tooth and holding the angle as I apply the burr, the chain sharpens just fine. It only requires 2 - 3 passes of the burr without applying any pressure against the chain. I think the guide would have made this process appear to be more difficult than it really is."
3,Busta,"Good for a single, a few remixes thrown in, not bad for a couple of bucks. Busta has that fire"
5,Ultimate Splinter Tool!,"I work with wood on a regular basis and pick up a lot of splinters. The tweezers are fantastic for getting at buried splinters. The tips are very sharp and accurately mated. They allow you to probe into the skin without the trauma that would be sustained with cheaper, sloppier tweezers. Because it is so well made, I make sure to holster them in the soft case they came with. This is a well made tool and in my estimation is worth the expense."
2,Pretty but Dumb,"While the artwork has its own rather kinky charm and the fictive story line is obvious enough (unless you've really gone off the deep end of Devil's Reef), Lovecraft novices are still liable to come away from this book with misconceptions, and some old-timers are likely to find the blend of tabloid style and speculation vulgar. Does anyone still believe, for instance, that Sarah Susan L. was doing anything outside the 19th century norm in dressing little Howard in a frock (not a dress), or that this had the least effect on his psyche? It's rather like the film Amadeus - where does the fun stop and the misinformation begin? If you want to get close to Lovecraft the man, go with S.T. Joshi's mammoth bio (Necronomicon Press) or Peter Cannon's splendid collection of memoirs, Lovecraft Remembered (Arkham House), and if you want really good comic adaptions, try something like Esteban Maroto's Call of Cthulhu(Cross Plains Comics)."
2,Nothing exciting here,"For any dedicated devotee of HPL there is nothing new here except for a few clever twists in his life. Things like HPL's cat being called ""Necro Man"" instead of ""Nigger Man"" are cheesily ""correct"" and irritating. Any objections to Mark Twains writings too ? Save your money for ""The Art of HPL's Cthulhu Mythos"" due out in Oct 06 !"
2,Meh.,"I would give the artwork in this book a full five stars, but for anyone with any legitimate love of HPL's work, the story is pathetic. The overall concept is fine, but the dialogue is pretty blah, and the insertion of a love story left me cold.Lovecraft has been my favorite author since the age of 14 and I really wish that when someone chooses to do an adaptation of sorts that they would cut out the speculation and just work with the information that's available - really, it is more than enough.I really did love the artwork, though."
1,Why is there no zero stars option?,"As a woman (who incidentally learned to read when I was two years old), I found this book to be apalling and insulting. What the book boils down to is that we'd be better off if we didn't read, but the evil patriarchy has imposed literacy on us so we need to know how to read, but reading is against the female nature so we're even worse off.Please don't waste your time and money on this dreck."
5,The alphabet versus the Goddess,"Very good book, interesting and comprehensible. You don't need to be a scientist to understand the subject.I would suggest also reading ""When God Was a Woman"" and ""The Chalice and the Blade"", because the theme is related."
2,"Nice try, but. . .","This sounded like a great theory. Literacy battles goddess worship throughout the centuries. There's lots of interesting historical info, especially on the conflict between religion as preached by its founders (Jesus and Muhammed, for example) and the brutalities inflicted by subsequent followers of the religion. But the author never connects his historical illustrations to his stated theory. Here's an example of his typical argument: the witchcraft persecutions peaked in the 15th century. The printing press was invented in the 15th century. Increased literacy therefore led to persecution of women. Right. The book never comes through with any real proofs. Right brain/left brain is old stuff and that's all he really ends up with. Summary: a big disappointment."
3,An interesting history book,"This book has an interesting topic. Analyzing the left and the right brain to decide masculine and femine power in the world. His thesis is that with the advent of the written culture(writing is a left brain function),man who's left brain is more developed, is able to supress the woman. This is interesting, and he sticks to his topic in the first quarter of the book, but past that he just goes into history. At first it has a relevant topic to his thesis, but after a while it is hard to see the link. He never goes back to his thesis in these history ventures, and this makes it hard to see why he is using the examples. The history is interesting to learn about, but he picks and chooses his facts, and does not state the full picture. This was a decent book to read, but I was a little upset with him straying from his main point. -RM"
1,Pathetic attempt at science,"This book has an interesting thesis, unfortunately, it is riddled with inconsitancy and pseudo science. The first couple of chapters deal with the evolution of the human brain. However, Shlain doesn't have the foggiest idea about what evolution is or how it works.The concept is good and I think that their might be a case for a less sweeping version of it. But this book isn't worth the time."
5,Excellent-One of the most thought provoking books I've read.,"L. Shlain's theory has been almost inpossible for me to stop thingking about-I'd love to see/hear someone dispute it, my guess is it would be incredibly hard to do so. A very easy read,yet keeps you guessing and thinking the whole time."
5,"Incredibly insightful, brilliant, and thought provoking","I thought Shlain's 3rd book, Sex, Time, and Power, was one of the most brilliant, well written books I've ever read. The Alphabet Versus the Goddess has managed to impress me even more. Shlain's astounding theories are revolutionary, and he backs them up with excellent scholarship and sound arguments. This book should replace Western History textbooks, and is a must for any writer or artist, regardless of whether s/he is interested in gender studies. It not only elucidates why we must become more whole brained thinkers/feelers, it paves new directions in the fields of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. It is undeniably history and herstory, woven together in an exquisite work of art."
1,"garbage in, garbage out","Anyone who has studied even a smidgen of cultural anthropology would realize that Shlain's argument carries no weight. Where are all the pre-literate societies which practice goddess worship and treat women fairly? The fact is that the inequitable treatment of women is just as much if not even more prevalent in pre-literate societies as it is in literate ones.Shlain is exploiting the naive and undeserved attention which so many people offer for no other reason than that the author has before his name those magic letters ""Dr"". He should reserve that title for his working life. If his ideas had been forced to stand up under their own strength then the precious resources of paper and ink which were wasted on this book might have been saved for a better purpose."
2,"Shlain's theory is quite interesting, but a bit farfetched","Shlain's book made for a good read, however it seemed hard to agree with what he was writing. He spent a lot of time sifting through history to find facts (ideas) to try and prove his thesis. Should we go back to being an illiterate society so women can get higher status?"
3,keep an open mind...,"The issues discussed in Mr. Shlain's book are undeniably intriguing; however, several points he makes are incorrect. With only a little bit of research, I was able to disprove some of his assertions (for example, the relationship between goddesses and animal symbolism). Often Mr. Shlain seems to find convenient proof in order to substantiate his claims. This book is definately worth reading, just try not to blindly accept everything he is saying as fact."
1,Hooey.,"Is this guy serious? What a crock.a. Coinciding events do not suggest a causal relationship. It's like saying the passing of the Haley-Bopp comet caused me to fail my math exam. b. If the new religions wanted to make themselves look as different as possible from existing religions, for political reasons, it would make sense that they would replace the matriarchy w/ a patriarchy in people's minds, people like simple black/white answers. c. Women may have been worshipped in those good old days, but they were hardly treated well -- sacrificing of virgins to the Euphrates every spring is not exactly something I'd like to go back to.Women -- learn math and science, get paid better! Now that's empowering."
2,I wouldn't recommend it,"I wouldn't recommend this book for the sole reason that th author is based on a simple division of our brain as left/male hemsiphere and right/female one. It does have some fundament. But his theory looses its ground when we consider writing as art (thus both related to the right hemisphere and to women); and when we have major litterate civlizations such as minoans and elamites whose religion was exclusively of GODDESS worship. Thus goddess (woman-centered society), litteracy, art, civlization are all in the same basket and linked to each other --not separeted."
2,The only book I've ever stopped reading,The theory was fascinating but the scholarship is atrocious. How anyone could give this four stars (without being paid) is beyond me.It did give me some intersting jumping-off points for my own theories but he cannot support any of his own. Most of what he purports is based upon the story of Moses AS THOUGH IT WERE HISTORICAL FACT! Come on! I have never written so many derrogatory remarks in the margin.I did like the brief history of human evloution and some of the origins of Judaism but that's about it.Don't buy this book for more than a few dollars.
1,Why isn't this a picture book?,"I think this book would have been a lot more persuasive had he presented it as a series of images. Of course, then he couldn't have engaged in the level of analysis that the use of written language afforded him. Hmmm... that is a conundrom, isn't it?"
5,"The most stimulating, provocative and fascinating book.","""The Alphabet..."" is the most stimulating, provocative and fascinating book that I have read in my recent memory.It has repeatedly sent me to the dictionary, encyclopedia, and other sources, motivated me to make notes, and caused me to recommend it to a large and diverse collection of family, friends, and acquaintances. In my view, the circumstantial evidence marshalled in support of the author's thesis is remarkable and persuasive, even if causation is incapable of absolute proof. The depth,breadth, and clarity, as well as the erudite and delightful choice of words and phrases, makes it a ""must read and continue to contemplate"", irrespective of the ultimate validity of the underlying thesis. I'm part way though reading it again, and find it even more illuminating the second time."
2,short and sweet review,"the songs on this cd are terrible, but the score is actually very good. So unless you are a really big fan of score music, I would not recommend spending money on this cd."
4,"Crystal clear scores, excellent songs, but a bit lacking...","Looking back on my first review, I would like to make some modifications and change my ratings.While the songs are excellent and the scores are good, the scores lack some of the scenes and cues from the movie itself which I desired to listen to; particulary the opening sequence.Otherwise, the Sting songs; in fact all of the songs (save the annoying ""Lamma Lamma"") are great and the score is mostly lively, yet still somewhat lacking.In short, the New Groove soundtrack is good, but there are definately better pieces with the advent of the Atlantis and Shrek scores, both of which are avaliable at Amazon."
5,The Greatest all time Christmas Album,"This is the only Chrismas CD I listen to more than once each Christmas season. My family first got this in 8 track form. This album helped me get through the first Christmas after my dad died. I have owned it in every possible format from 8 track, album, cassette,and CD. Thank you Charley Pride."
4,UMMM it's toner,"It makes portions of white paper black thereby showing sometimes graphic or explicit images and text.Save your old cartridge and refill it for the next time, you can get 2-3 refills out of the empties before the cartridge dies and needs a proper rebuild."
4,Very good 80's compilation,"I think that this CD is definitely worth adding to your Christmas collection. It does lack a few songs that I would have liked to have, but it is definitely worth owning. (especially if you can get it for less than $10)"
2,Not so sure?!?!,"While if find most of the songs on this CD are great and from the 80""s (they) forgot a few. One of them being Sting's ""Gabriels Message"" and how on earth could (they) forget the most memorable 80's Christmas song...""Do they know it's Christmas time"" by Band-Aid. That WAS the 80's! (...)"
2,Edge of Christmas Redux,"All of the songs on this CD have been released over and over again on various compilations over the years. Most of them are on Edge of Christmas. Come on VH1, get with it. I won't be buying this one."
4,A pretty decent collection for the money.,"And I'm sooooo happy they didn't include ""Last Christmas"" by Wham or that cheesy ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" track.My favorite tracks, by far, are the Waitresses and George Thorogood selections."
2,Where is..,"where is Do They Know Its Christmas Time? by Band Aid, that is one of my favorite christmas songs, along wiht many of ny friends. Yet its not on many cds.. this really isnt a complete 80's christmas cd."
1,Misleading artist listings!,"These songs are found over and over, great as they are on other compilations. Amazon makes it very difficult to compare apples to apples by not clearly listing all of the recording artists."
4,Good but not a keeper!,"The Snow Garden was a good book written by Bethany Campbell, it was a cute little story about a guy named Ty Marek and a lady named Hedy Hansen but though I enjoyed reading it I didn't think it was a keeper nor would I want to read it again, it was good once but I don't feel the need to read it again."
5,Charming!,"Beautiful socialite Haley Caufield couldn't believe she woke up naked one morning to discover the very handsome and much-sought-after wealthy Sacramento, California bachelor, Adam Harrington! Haley and her cousin Jay are the owners of the almost defunct Sacramento Builders and Adam is the son of Martin Harrington of Sacramento's building empire of Harrington Construction. Even more shocking is the fact that Haley and Adam are married and she can't remember it happening! Haley moved to Sacramento to escape one scandal and now she's created another! Her only option now is to make the best of it, but can their differences make a successful union?THE MARRIAGE MISHAP is a fun, quick and easy read! As in all of Judith Stacy's books, this is another uniquely touching tale of love found and the difficult quest getting there! A+"
2,Very Scottish -,"Wish I could say that this is a great series, but we bought the entire series and only finished about half of the shows. Beautiful Scottish countrysides and villages, but the stories were not well written or played. Also the quality of the film left a lot to be desired."
4,"There's nothing ""out of this world"" about From Another World","Before buying this album, I had not heard any of it or knew much about it. I had keep seeing this album pop up on websites and thought it looked interesting. I had may assumptions of what this album problably sounded like.Being a collector of early electronic, exotica/lounge and jazz records, I assumed I would hear something similar to recordings by artists such as esquivel, les baxter, attilio mineo and the like. It seemed like a must have. Upon my first listening, I soon discovered to my discontent that this was not a very outer spacy recording at all. This was a classic big band record.After a few listens it grew on me. It is an interesting experience, full wonderful orchestral sounds. If you are a fan of big band, this is worth listening to......but don't expect to be transported into space."
2,Good for a year.,"Pros:Very cheap when I bought it.Many pockets to hold various things.Cons:Lasted about 6 months before any problems.Made of flimsy and weak materials.Don't even think about putting a laptop in here; has no padding at all.Has a useless Velcro strip inside that just tears up everything inside.I purchased this item November 2008 to hold my school books. It was good for about 6 months. It held all my books and papers. After 6 months things started to come apart. The pencil and pen holders had holes from the tips, the shoulder strap padding was flattened and was coming apart; it felt as if the whole bag changed shape. Only buy this if you cannot afford anything else. After a year it just was not usable anymore."
3,BriefCase,"I thought this would be a thicker material. Very thin. I purchased this item for my son, he likes this type of style instead of a backpack for school."
4,nice for the price,This bag will work perfect for what i want.but if you are looking for something to carry alot of stuff or heavier stuff you may wh=ant something a little stronger. It is made of cheeper matterials. I needed somthing to keep up with a couple of folders and a note book that kind of stuff so it is great for that I am happy with it for what I wanted just make sure it will met your needs
2,product seems cheaply made,"This is a very basic and not terribly well constructed bag. May be worth the $14.99, but $10 shipping? No way. My husband ordered this along with another product from Roni's Casual Wear. Informed later that second item no longer available, and credited. Disappointed. Would not have ordered this item individually given shipping cost. With both items, combined shipping was more reasonable."
4,"Great set, but be careful if the seller is amazon","We have a set of 12 of this flatware, and love it. SoI bought this from amazon for my sister because of the free shipping, oneida would have charged me for the shipping. It arrived minus the extra teaspoons. amazon customer service was great about replacing them, but the replacement set also came minus the extra teaspoons. finally they let us make a complete set from the incomplete sets and return the rest."
3,"Right church, wrong pew","Although the article was brand new, it was not the correct pattern of flatware, which I believe was due to an incorrect description of it in the first place. Thus, I had to return the item at a high postage rate due to its weight. I am not at all happy about this and will pursue how the problem came about."
3,Target Steamer Set,"For the low, affordable price I paid, the pot is great. It serves its purpose. There was fast delivery."
4,Good horror,"See storyline above.I really enjoyed this book involving Chase Dagger and Sara the shape-shifter. I must also mention Einstein the macaw, quite a bird in itself. There is mystery and there is horror and there is action, blended all together in this above normal tale of superstition. You really get to like most of the characters and their unique personalities. Lee Driver (aka Sandra Tooley) has written a very entertaining horror novel that will keep you in your seat till the sun comes up. I look forward to the next Dagger Mystery and hope that Sara tags along.Highly recommended for horror and mystery buffs."
5,YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE,"FULL MOON BLOODY MOON is the second Chase Dagger mystery; the first was THE GOOD DIE TWICE.Chase Dagger is back, but this time he will need more than luck to catch a killer that has been around for more than 200 years.... Knowing that Oct. 13th a Friday was not even here yet, the worse was yet to happen.FULL MOON BLOODY MOON has the same unconventional and fetching characters as THE GOOD DIE TWICE. Einstein the bright red macaw that has a big mouth, Chase's right hand woman, Sara, Simon the mailman who knows everybody's business. Padre and Skizzy are also back as well as some new characters. FULL MOON BLOODY MOON is a ferocious horror-filled ride that will stick with you well after you have finished reading the book. Mixed with sex, violence and plenty of fast paced action. I hung onto every word.Lee Driver (aka S.D. Tooley ) you have done it again, keep up the good work."
3,"Story is Captivating - Characters, bit typical and 2.dimensional","The plot of the books are good. If one is a fan of fantasy in a modern setting with combination of shapeshifter, werewolves etc. then this series is perfect.Elegant writing style, capitures readers' imaginations and well paced.One bad point is that the characters are all a little typical and two dimensional; you have the sweet shy heroine whom everyone loves, the hero who is dark and brooding and somehow always around sweetheart; the beautiful, daddy's rich little girl, jealous ex gf who seems a little exaggerated as a diva and whom, of course, everyone hates; the best friend side line copper and...at least in this book, Spagnola, the typical bad ass cop who's fiery and acts before he thinks whilst, in the light of the hero Dagger, makes him look like a rash idiot compared to Dagger's cool and always perfectly calculated moves....seems a little too much."
5,Great Book,"Great book! Full of suspense and humor. If you like Laurell Hamilton or Kim Harrison, you will like this book."
3,I plan to pawn it.........,"I'm only giving this album 3 stars because if it were any other band, it would be pretty unbelievable, but The Boredoms can do better than this. 2 tracks, both about 20 minutes, and really, both are fairly unremarkable compared to tracks from Vision Creation Newsun, Super Ar, Pop Tatari, hell, just about any other Boredoms CD. I found myself at first rationalizing my purchase and saying, ""Any Boredoms CD is worth owning"". By the end of it I was pissed. The last track is a bunch of sitars droning in a cave with no deviation (for 20 minutes, no less). Do yourself a favor and get one of the other three albums I've mentioned - they're awesome. This is highly disappointing, especially after waiting for a new Boredoms album for 5 years."
3,Not what you'd think it is.,"While the cassette version of Maps in a Mirror is worthwhile for a completist or fanatic, it's not quite what most people would imagine it to be. The tree pulp version of Maps in a Mirror is a fairly large tome, and if I remember correctly it has around 50 stories in it. The tape version of Maps in a Mirror has 8 stories, including one previously only available in Polish. As a Card fanatic, I don't really mind. I just don't want anyone else buying this thinking they'll get a box of 20 tapes of Card's short fiction."
5,Intense read,"Next to my Bible there is no more dog-eared copy of a book in my house than ""Maps in a mirror"". My wife and I have read through this book three times a piece. From powerfully chilling to heart wrenching sadness. Thanks Mr. Card you have thoroughly impressed me again!"
4,A horror story worthy of anything written by Steven King,"The original version of the story Lost Boys (later expanded into an inferior novel) is to be found here, and it is truly a frightening story. The events unfold, and before you realize it, you discover that the story is autobiographical.Also here are: CLOSING THE TIME LID--a wildly delicious time travel story--KING'S MEAT--a touching, and ironic tale of life on a planet that has been taken over by wierd squid-like aliens, who prey on human flesh--and of course the CLASSIC short story, UNACCOMPANIED SONATA. Words fail to discribe how touching and beautiful, how sad, and wonderful is this story of a future time when everybody gets to do whatever makes them most happy."
5,A True Master of Short Fiction,"In the Maps in a Mirror collection, Card shows that he is a true master of Short Fiction. Along with Bradbury and King, OSC is one of my favorite authors of the short story. I was glad to see this newly issued collection on the market. I spent quite a bit of time and effort collecting the previous seperate paperback editions of Card's short stories.This collection will take you everywhere. From fantasy, to science fiction, to horror, and art. I highly recommend Maps in a Mirror. Get it today, and you'll be hooked on OSC!"
5,The Most Creative Mind,"Is there anyone out there with a more creative mind than OSC? Can't imagine it. After reading Treasure Box (disappointing), this completely restores my faith in OSC as one of our nation's true literary gifts. He has such a unique ability to generate characters a reader can relate to within the first 2-3 paragraphs. Have no idea how he does it. This is a masterpiece of short stories. Can't recommend highly enough. Have told everyone I know to get this and purchased volumes for my daughter and others. Read this collection!"
2,Umm....,"I read this when I was much younger (About 15, I'm 26 now), and it deeply impacted me at the time. Reading it again now completely turned me off Card's writing, he seems to be arrogant and condescending at the same time. Some good stories though, so I gave it the two stars. But now even Ender's Game has been tainted in my eyes."
3,Erm...,"While I appreciate the weirdness of most of the stories, I must admit I'm giving the book a three because its writer is a pretentious jerk... good stories though! Keep it up, you scourge..."
4,"Interesting, but...","Ben Goldberg is a helluva clarinetist and composer, John Schott is a skilled drummer, and (sorry!) I forget the guitarist's name. I no longer own this disc, which says something. It's dark, moody, rich, intelligent, and free, taking Goldberg ever further from the mainstreams of jazz and Jewish music. It is, however, simply NOWHERE NEAR AS ENGAGING as the New Klezmer Trio material, and I'd recommend MELT ZONK REWIRE or SHORT FOR SOMETHING long before recommending this. This IS a fine album, and Goldberg is someone well worth knowing, but come to it later, if you need MORE. Buy MELT ZONK REWIRE a.s.a.p., though, if you're interested in explorations at the juncture of klezmer and free jazz, of just love the clarinet in jazz contexts."
5,Worth every penny,"OCZ stands behind their products, so purchasing anything manufactured by them is a no-brainer. The memory works great and I highly recommend OCZ products."
4,Not as good as hoped..,"I personally LOVE InuYasha for its witty characters, great plot, and terrific execution onto film..but I found the first movie a bit disappointing (although I still like it) after watching the second, third and fourth movie. The first one was boring because it felt like an elongated episode, whereas the second, third, and fourth movie actually looked like MOVIES..and the antagonist of this movie was killed off way too easily. The reason why I felt like it was just an elongated episode and not like a real movie like the rest of the InuYasha movies was because the plot was just too simple..it was an episode plot..but it was still an OK movie. Just not as good as the rest"
5,Inu-Yasha,I like when Inu-Yasha uses his big choppy sword to kill Menomaru. It was cool like the mongoose likes the muffins. Mongoose Man outie like the mongoose leaves the stadium! Play ball!
4,Like Moths to the Flame,"The first Inu Yasha movie was interesting enough, but it ran like more of an extended episode than anything else. The art style was decent, but it was noticeably different from the regular series. The voice actors maintained their characters well, but ultimately, the movie is just adequate. If you're a fan of Inu-Yasha, you'll like it. If you are not a fan, then this movie will not indoctrinate you."
1,my item was in terrible condition,I ordered a dvd and it arrived in terrible condition. It doesnt work at all. It skips and freezes all throughout the movie. I kept trying to move on past the bad parts but they kept re-occuring. Absolutely horrible.
3,"Same Old, Same Old","Sorry to all of the other fans out there, but I just don't see what is so overwhelmingly good about this movie. It seems like just another way to get money from adoring fans (just like many of the Harry Potter movies...*cough cough*). There is no real substantial plot, and the way Kikyo and Sesshomaru walk in and leave just as quickly shows the creator's desperate need to try and break up the monotony. Yes, there is good art and the voice overs are good, but the movie lacks any of the humor, characterization, or originality of the television shows. They beef up the ""bad guy"" to almost Naraku-like proportions, then when the baddy finally reaches full power, Inuyasha defeats him with a single stroke. Devoted fans are probably still going to check this movie out just for the heck of it, but be warned that it is an average movie and nothing of great consequence should be expected from it."
4,"Inuyasha, The Movie 1 - Affections Touching Across Time","Inuyasha, The Movie 1 - Affections Touching Across TimeQuick service. Delivered on time as promised and product came in as shown in picture.Thank you!!!"
1,i don't like it,"i don't know why a lot of people like this, but i really don't. it seems like the plot of a hundred other animes out there, it's really predictable. and why do everyone have long hair?"
1,I agree with everyone who gave this one star...,"InuYasha is stupid and childish, and it's TOO sappy (and yes, I'm a GIRL and I don't like sappy stuff...*gasp*!) with not enough of a good storyline. I WOULD NOT reccomend getting this movie, cuz your only wasting your money and your time. Try watching REAL anime, like FullMetal Alchemist, instead of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z and InuYasha. You'll thank yourself.To conclude, if I could give this a BOMB rating, I would, because there is absolutely nothing good in this good for nothing piece of trash they call a movie."
1,wrong size,"Though I followed the model number, this plate is too small for mymicrowave. Very frustrating to have ordered this. Won't order again."
3,good tray,This was ordered as the numbers mentioned the one needed to replace mine..but it is 1 inch smaller all the way around which is okay but the larger size does go better in the microwave..
2,Buyer Beware,"The two model numbers listed are NOT the same size. WB39X10003 is 12 1/2 inches in diameter and WB49X10002 is 13 1/2 inches in diameter. One of the sellers claims that GE has discontinued WB49X10002, but I found that you can still get it if you search the internet. Regardless, the product page should explicitly point out that if you are looking to replace your 13 1/2 inch plate and you order this product, you will receive a 12 1/2 plate."
2,mine doesnt get hot enough anymore,"mine came as a small kit with different tips, the solder tip for electronic type stuff doesnt heat up as good as the other tips, idk why, but i would get another iron. owned it for maybe 8 months, and rarely used it."
3,How People Live,"This is actually a classroom edition so the content is okay but not as good as I expected. It was only available as a used copy but I gave it a try. It should have never been re-sold, it was in very poor condition and we were extremely disappointed."
4,Living Legend,"Williams is a living legend. Critics claim he lacks emotion but cannot dispute his flawless, superhuman technique. I only wish he would stop using that Smallman guitar for his all his recordings/performances. He does use a Gaetano Guadagnini from 1814 on this one for the Giuliani Concerto which sounds suprisingly good. John Williams is doing a tremendous amount for making guitar recordings accessible to non guitarists and for lending credibility to the guitar as a serious, magical and enchanting instrument. Bravo! Mr. Williams."
5,"Terrific music, superbly performed","The Arpeggione Sonata of Schubert sounds terrific in this performance by John Williams and the Australian Chamber Orchestra. We were privileged to hear the piece performed live by these performers in Penrith [outer Sydney suburb] around the time that the CD was recorded.While ""it's never the same unless you're there at the game"" as football fans know, the recording is as good as a recording can be.Highly recommended."
3,"Good, great, excellent, but...","No one with ears can fault Williams's, as always, excellent playing, but what's with the pairing with the Giuliani Concerto? Do we really need to hear that recorded again and again? Enough already!"
1,"Schubert: ""Arpeggione"" Sonata: Guiliani: Guitar Concerto","This CD was so very dissapointing. the Arpeggione was good, however, the Guiliani was lacking. I must say, overall, a waste of money. Classical guitar is very enjoyable, but I cannot say that for this entire CD."
5,Una obra maestra,"Esta es tal vez una de las mejores peliculas de los ultimos aÃ±os, con la gran fortaleza de ser contada en una narrativa clara y nostalgica, con cambios en los colores de fonde y dandole la mayor iportancia a la historia y no a los efectos especiales. Indispensable"
5,amazing,my favorite movie of all time. It combines excellent acting and vivid images. This film is silient yet has the power of a movie with dialogue
4,a parody of communist bloc?,"I went to see the movie waiting to be entertained (yes, having in mind those films of Jeunet/Caro) but while the movie keep rolling i catched this feeling of watching a sort of parody on the recent history of the communist/sovietic society. Politics and economic frustration permeating throughout the film. I might be taking this too far but that's what i got from it. Just think of it as another way to read this funny and entertaining piece of art."
5,A must read for investors,"This book by Michael McDonald is an excellent one for obtaining an insight into the workings of the sometimes confusing stock market. His method of presentation makes it understandable, especially for the average non professional investor like myself.How many people who invest in bonds really know how they are priced, or what fair value of stocks is, or how lump sum pensions are calculated? This information alone, based on stacking the money theory, is worth the price of the book.His analysis of market timing versus buy and hold is a must read, plus learning about the Elliot wave theory and how to use it, along with contrary opinion, and if the market is in a trading range, gives you valuable tools to use in guiding your investment decisions.Anyone new to the market, as well as serious investors who have been in the market for sometime, should have this book in their library to take advantage of McDonald's expertise and experience."
1,Much more a pack of writings to entertain or promote himself than to educate the readers,"This is one of the worst trading/investment book I had read for long. The book title is completely misleading. I guess that the author, in 2002, had predicted a range trading market in coming years and so he wrote a book to backup and document his hypothesis to sell to his brokerage customers. I dont mind whether he made it right or wrong. However, I am very disappointed of how messy and disorganised his book is, that I really cant understand how he reached his conclusions with very brief coverage on Chaos Theory, Elliot Waves, Contrarian Indicators.....In short, I strongly recommend you to give it a pass not because of the outdated investment advice but the absence of applicable learnings."
5,The classic reference text,"Robert Hand's classic text is the authoritative astrological reference for professional astrologers and the simply curious. The author's starting point is that astrology is not a belief system but a knowledge system, and that when understood and practiced correctly astrology has explanatory power. Every science ultimately rests on its 'predictive validity'. In other words, is a body of knowledge able to say in advance what will happen under certain conditions yet to arise? This text does precisely that. The author describes the inner and outer experiences most likely to occur during a particular planetary transit. His clear no-nonsense explanations elevate this book head and shoulders above the many derivative texts written since."
5,You need to have this book to do astrology.,This book is the same as the daily horoscopes on astro.com. Robert Hand is a wonderful astrologer. I really recommend that you purchase it. You will be glad that you no longer have to shift through a dozen others to get inaccurate readings in the end. Probably the best transit book on the market.
5,the greatest astrology book in my collection,"My neighbor/mentorloaned me this book a year ago. I just now gave it back, it was so good. I refer to it almost on a daily basis. Mr. Hand has done an outstanding job in collecting the various pyschological effects that transits can have on us. I am able to plan very accurately according to the descriptions in this book. It let me know what to expect in all my Plutonian transits I have been having lately and, this is the greatest part, it has saved my marriage from collapsing. My wife and I figured out that the Pluto/Venus/Ascendant combos was causing the strife in our life and so we decided to wait it out instead of ending it.Thank you Mr. Hand"
4,The Bible of Transit Interpretation,"This book is a must for your astrological reference library. Written by the world's greatest living astrologer, Robert Hand, and Charles A. Jayne, it is an invaluable ""cookbook"" of transit interpretation for the budding professional astrologer-to-be. As a professional astrologer myself, an astrology teacher and a contemporary of Hand's, I would venture to say from my own personal experience, that virtually every professional astrologer in the past two decades has cut their teeth on this book. Hand is learned, profound, and sometimes downright uncanny in his interpretations. As I recall, he wrote this book in collaboration with Jayne, while Saturn was transitting his third house. This transit would be a classic for giving someone the discipline it takes to write something as tedious yet invaluable, as this book. It IS the Bible of transit interpretation."
5,The Astrologers Bible,"This book is a ""must have"" for anyone studying astrology. I purchased this book in the 70's and still take it from my bookshelf to consult when I need some additional information about a particular transit. It is well written with a psychological perspective, which helps an individual comprehend the manifesting trends. It is a definative 5 star resource."
2,"talented, but not timeless","Many fingerstyle acoustic guitar players seem to gravitate to displaying their technical talent rather than writing great songs. Preston is a great player, but the compositions are rather empty. It seems that in most cases a catchy guitar riff generated the songs, not the desire to write a good song. Many of the sounds and riffs are simple guitar tricks that sound cool but are generated by and limited by the instrument. The showing off grows old quickly. Check out Laurence Juber or Michael Hedges if a you seek acoustic guitar work with more substance that is more about the music and less about showing off an instrument."
1,RIP OFF!,"This laser pen stopped working after the first set of batteries ran out!! Whenever you push the button, it doesn't work!This is a total RIP OFF! It doesn't work at all, even with brand new batteries."
3,I5OO YARDS OR FEET,YOU SAID IT WOULD BE 1500 YARDS ON THE PACKAGE IT SAYS 1500 FEETI DOT THINK IT IS THAT GOOD
3,Mindless Fun,"It's a typical Ripley's book. Full of fun facts and images. It state however, that it's for 9 and older. I would probably put it a tad higher on the reading level. Probably should be at least a 5th grade reading level. My boys enjoyed the book overall"
4,A great listen only for those of the avante garde sound.,"This second offering from former Faith No More singer, Mike Patton is an album with an overall moody sound. Patton recreates a feel from an Italian anarchist cookbook, if you can imagine that happening. Patton composed the songs and performs on them with an all-star cast of friends and acquaintances in the hard rock and experimental jazz arenas. I would advise anyone who is a fan of patton's work with Mr. Bungle or anyone who is looking to broaden their musical taste horizons to purchase this album."
5,specialtreat,"experimentation with very little if any guidelines is what makes this so beautiful.i discoveredthis record almost a year ago by shear accident and almost everyone i know hates it.they are to used to'structure' and as great a thing structure can be it isn't ment to be applied to everything all the time.this is a great piece of work from patton i was fortunate to see mrbungle not to long ago and meet mike for a little amount of time but it was worth every second.meeting one of the only people i look up to and respect that is alive,it was nice.it is odd.not for the everyday FnM fan."
1,"My God, it's horrible","When Faith No More came to here on their last tour, I was lucky enough to go backstage and meet Mike Patton. When he was asked about this CD, he said he ""didn't want to talk about it."" It's not hard to imagine why. What can be said about a bunch of random noise created by outstanding musicians? Every musician creates an experiment now and then, but this is certainly not a successful one. No matter how musically adventurous you are, can you really claim to enjoy this? I can't. It's horrible. Mike Patton may be a genius but this recording is putrid anyway."
3,"bazzled, but delighted","I've been a mike patton fan since 1995, and only heard his solo project recently from a friend and online...all i can say is HOW THE HELL DOES THIS MAN DO IT????????I was somehow confused with his album but also tempted to explore the depths of music even more....thank God for this talented human being!!!!!"
5,almost bach,"If you listen to Zorn ( masada,redbird etc...) you will appreciate any work that Mike Patton has done in the past and in the future. Mike ( multi-talented ) Patton has done everything imaginable with his mind and voice ( or has he ? ) I think that the best is yet to come... California ?"
1,Anti Guest Music,This CD is perfect for removing those unwanted guest from your house and living room. Played repeatedly at any level you can enjoy the random samplings of everyday noises interrupted by cacophonic blarings of jazz.If you liked the noisy interludes from Mr. Bungles you will definitely appreciate this disk. . . it contains less than 5% of desirable music.
1,Goin' Against The Grain,"Everyone seems to love this cd, when in reality there isn't all that much music on it. there are a couple decent tracks but for the most part it rots. everyone knows mike patton is an awesowe singer. he doesn't really do much on this album at all. buying this album basically means that your obsessed with mike patton and you will basically like anything he does, and you most likely dress like the guy and emulate him in every way. thats my take anyway. as far as saying that it is genious in the avante garde world, it is really about as bad as it gets in that genre. not worth purchasing."
2,too overrated. in virginia. and all over.,"Lotsa people on stage can work really well (ie Sigur Ros, Spiritualized and the Arcade Fire) but it's not working when I saw you in KY it was sloppy.The only salvation is that the simplicity of this album carries through.Amber's voice echoes Rachel's in Mojave 3 & now that I think of it Nathan's is too similar to Neil Halstead's.Virgina's Mojave 3.TouchÃ©"
2,Save your money,Buy the synthetic one. To me its pretty much the same. This one even though it is supposed to be human hair does not hold heat to well like human hair should. The cheap one looks about the same as this one but its just synthetic and you cant try to put heat to it
3,Capleton (San Francisco),"PROS: Capleton's presentation and intro was good, to include song choice. Not sure about the size of the place but it seemed a bit small. the band was okay but not impressive.CONS: This performance is by far, inferior to the Capleton's performance in Brooklyn (Prospect Park, from the Still Blazin tour). I did not like the acoustics. There were times the band played lazy, as if they did not know the program. Overall, the sound system, engineering and mixing were a flop."

5,INCREDABLE RING.,"i had purchased a copy in england after charles and diana were married. the ring i bought from amazon.comis much better. better quality, and the colour of the stone is perfect,all the surrounding diamonds also look real. very brilliant, wear this and i promise you will be noticed. the stone is around 4 carats maybe a little more,this fact should have been mentioned in the description. i love this ring and will not do the dishes with it on. i think i will buy the dodi ring he was going to give diana before they both died.there is a listing through amazon.com"
2,Disappointed,"I couldn't wait to read this book. I'm not new to writings about China and the period following the Cultural Revolution, but was disappointed in this work. The author's observations seemed so self-serving and calculated to garner as much sympathy as possible...overkill, in other words. In fairness, I was moved by passages near the end describing the manner in which his family pulled together in their quest for higher education. At the very least, this book should make anyone thankful for all we have in the U.S."
2,A disappointment...,"I have read many memoirs of the Cultural Revolution and was rather disappointed in this one. The author is certainly intelligent and well-educated; however, he is also arrogant and self-centered. Reading this book is not a useful way to learn about this troubled period in Chinese history. It seemed to me that the author's main goal was to entertain a Western audience. If so, he was successful. I question the veracity of much of his story. For a well-written, educational and accurate portrayal of this period, I recommend Liang Heng's ""Son of the Revolution."""
3,"Enjoyable, but ......","I found Da Chen's story enjoyable and have great respect for the sacrifices he and his family made that enabled him to come to the US. Having said that, I found the book to be a little simplistic with respect to the historical context as compared to other ""memoirs"", such as Wild Swans by Jung Chang."
5,Colors of the Mountain,"To me, this memoir was better than ""Angela's Ashes"" or maybe it was because I knew so little of rural life in China. I am constantly amazed that out of such poverty and humilation, these people can have moments of true happiness and have an insight that few of us ever understand. Da Chen lived a life where most would give up and adhere to the system, and I admire his eagerness and willingness to study and learn in an effort to change his life. It is a book that touches your very soul. Anyone who enjoys memoirs or biographies will truly enjoy this book."
1,Color me bored,"Hey, I thought this book was going to be interesting. To me it sounds like it was written by some ""privileged"" kid who woke up one morning and found himself on the other side of the fence! Yes there is a little color, and a bit of humor, but over all not much substance or compassion, especially when he talks about how he and other people treat animals. May I suggest ""Waiting"" by Ha Jin. Does anybody have a cigarette?"
1,Fiction desguised as autobiography,"I was excited to acquire the book after reading all the positive reviews. I wish I could get my money back now. It is, at best, a fiction desguised as autobiography. The story is full of holes. For instances, three years of great starvation ended in 1961,not 1962 as stated in the book and Cultural Revolution started in 1966, not 1962, as stated in the book's front jacket. Then there is the ""heartbreaking"" scene of him lacking 3yuan to pay for tuition because pigs were not ready for sale. Tuition and books were free in China. A landlord's family would not be allowed to have pigs. (My grandparents were landlords. Everything of any value was taken away.) The college entrance exam was very competitive the first year it was open in 1976 after 10 years of the Cultural Revolution. By 1977, the second year the exam was offered, the competition was not so fierce as Da Chen led the readers to believe."
1,Autobiography or Incredible,"It seems to me that there are many holes in the ""autobiography"" presented by the author, Da Chen. I found them incredible."
4,Coming to understand,"As with many recent memoirs, ""Colors of the Mountain"" is a warm-hearted, plain spoken, attempt at understanding a childhood -- one more difficult than most of us can possibly imagine. A born artist, Da Chen seems to have spent most of his life in America determining how to come to grips with this impossible youth. Most reader criticisms have to do with the book's flawed factual details -- but what writer is going to remember the names of office-holders and bureaucrats from when he was nine years old? The more important point is that Da Chen made something out of this remarkably trying childhood and became a remarkable man and writer. That is why the book was written. I look forward to the sequel."
5,Think for yourself and READ THIS BOOK!,"I'm sick of the reviewers that are China apologists that have attacked this wonderful book. If you're such defenders of that cruel government, why are you living in the United States? Da Chen's story of how he survived the cultural revolution and brought honor to his family is inspirational and TRUE! He lived it, not YOU! The ending is especially touching as to the relationship between a father and his son. Again, don't listen to the negative reviews and read this book. You won't regret it!"
5,quick email response and shipping,Very smooth transaction. Book was in great condition and was shipped very quickly. No problems at all. Thanks!
3,The bankruptcy of the Chinese Communist system.,"One wonders why the communist system was swept into the dustbin of history. Da Chen tells you why. Intellectuals were purged in Mao's society and people learned very little. In fact, school was not even required of everyone. Only after Mao joined Lenin in a masoleum did intelligence and ability matter much.Da Chen relates his early life story about his early Chinese childhood in the rural south of China. He was discriminated against because he was a son of a former landlord. Peasants lorded it over him and his family. Da Chen relates his experiences of the Cultural Revolution and how the school system was devastated by the purges and reeducation.Da Chen escaped this poverty by using his intelligence to shine in the reform education system after Mao's death. He received a state education in English and went on to emigrate to New York. A nice rages to riches story and the tyranny of the Communist system."
1,Does not light up,"The clock's purpose is wonderful, giving you three different pieces of information but it does not illuminate so you can't read any of it!!!"
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I bought this clock mostly for its function, but also I loved the design.For me, personally, I had difficulty getting the time set; however, my BF got it done with ease.The reason for the 3 stars is due to the fact that the time doesn't adjust for daylight savings time."
3,Good could have been better!,Tara has become Max mistress for the last year. In this romance title the hero tells his heroine from the beginning his love for her. Though she knows that her mother and sister thinks he is using her because she only sees him a few weekends or a week when he is town. Most of the times he is there they are in bed. She begins wondering if that's all she is to him a bedmate. Eventually he ask her to come and travel with him. Before she does so she finds out she is pregnant. She runs away after telling him about it because she did not like the tone of how he spoke about the baby. This is basically the author's way of bringing conflict to the book to give it a happy conclusion. I felt the conflict did not have merit since she knew he loved her and shared private stories of family and past loves with here. Okay read good amount of sexual overtones.
2,"Okay read, nothing special",Save me from silly young heroines who don't know what they want. And for a man in his 30s - who's apparently been around the block enough - not to know what the woman in his bed wants is pathetic.But I liked the author's use of secondary characters and filling us in about their lives - hence the 2 stars.
3,crime classics,the price was great and the movies are ok...the perfect thing for a day when you're snowed in or it's raining out.
3,Good value for the price,"Enjoyed most of the movies and the quality is good. A few movies were lame, but most were good with actors like Edward G. Robinson and Frank Sinatra in gripping performances. Even better, if you can buy at a discount."
2,"Disappointing if you're looking for E, G, Robinson","I found this DVD on Amazon by searching for Edward G. Robinson. As you can see from the cover shot, he is pmominently displayed. Out of the 50 movies there is only one in which he is the star. Only one of Frank Sinatra as well. In fact only one each of anyone you are likely to have heard of before. If I slog through all 50 I will probably find more of Robinson as a 2nd banana or bit player. I know that as a kid I saw a lot of him in movies."
1,Old movies,Enjoyed watching the old movies and seeing famous stars as they were in their early days.
3,Your money's worth,"I have purchased several 50 packs in this series, and while this is not 5 starworthy, it's still a good value for the money."
4,By far the best X record,"This record displays all of the qualities which made X one of, if not the, greatest band to come out of the LA punk scene. This, their third full legnth, benefits from the rawness of the first album, ""Los Angeles,"" but thankfully avoids the keyboard playing of Ray Manzerek and thin, boring production of ""Wild Gift."" A great record musically and lyrically by some of the greatest punk songwriters ever!"
4,Solid 1982 Album From Los Angeles Punks X,"Released in 1982, ""Under The Big Black Sun"" was my first exposure to the band X. I first discovered them by seeing their video for ""The Hungry Wolf"" on MTV that year. It was the best period for MTV because they were not so dictated by the corporate types out there. MTV used to play videos by a lot of punk bands back then. This was before Michael Jackson came along and ruined everything. Maybe it is because of the video and the fact that this was my introduction to the band X but ""The Hungry Wolf"" is my favorite song on the album and makes for a storming opening track. Full of attitude and that galloping, tough rhythm, ""The Hungry Wolf"" has always been one of my favorite X songs. There are other great songs on the album too and they are:Under The Big Black SunBecause I DoBlue SparkThere is not a weak track on the album so check out this record from the earlier years of X."
5,Fond Memories,"Charlie and the Angel has been my favorite movie since I was a child. I have collected many of the Classic Disney movies, and my own children have grown up watching them. Now my grown children are buying these movies for their future children. Going to a theater to see the new Disney movie was a treat when I was a kid and I have very fond memories of spending time with my family at the movies."
5,Loved it.,Brought back lots of memories. Will watch over and over. The best show I have ever seen in my life.
5,One of my favorite Christmas CD's.,"This is not just a hodge podge of various artists thrown together like some other Christmas CD's. The songs are similar enough to hang together and different enough to be interesting. They are performed with both skill and emotion. I loved the rendition of ""Little Drummer Boy"", one of my favorite Christmas songs. Leo Kottke's guitar playing is wonderful, as usual. The CD is roughly 35 minutes long. There are no vocals. If you are one of those people who enjoys instrumental music, then I highly recommend this CD."
3,repeat collection,The songs here are found on other Windham Hill cds making this redundant for those who have the other cds.
3,Frustrating,"I don't know - maybe I got a different album. This album is one of those frustrating ones that you end up never playing because of a few songs. The baby crying one? Oh my. What were they thinking. I am all for exprimental tunes, but the baby has to go. That is the one that immediately comes to mind.Half of the album is wonderful, brillant, catchy. The other half is tedious and annoying.I bought this used thinking it would be a steal, but now i may burn the few tracks i like and resell it.darn."
5,"Not your usual business book, thank goodness!","This book is like a light going on. It talks about taking risks, trusting others and yourself, and puts forth the radical notion that says ""why the heck can't you do well and love what you're doing?"" The thing that really impressed me (and I've tried it in my business and it works!) is the counter-intuitive idea that actually saying no and turning down some things can lead to bigger things. This is not a book I just read once and put away. I keep it in my briefcase and refer to it from time to time. People centered business, starting with your own person. A very fresh take. Highly recommended."
2,A brief REVIEW of this Book,"Isn't it amazing how this book receives 5 stars by every reviewer - lucky author. Not one critical comment ! Reviews or publicity blurbs ?Put simply, I like the idea of life coaching. The book had some good points. But I was annoyed by the motherhood statements peppered throughout the book(Go out and play in the rain; Be somebody; Think BIG etc etc...which are pretty meaningless and could have been left out). Were they to pad out the book or 'dumb down' the book for us the reader ?The author could have provided a more pithy book without the non-statements or added more meat..."
2,Two nuggets,"One situation was somewhat similar to mine. The rest were not very helpful. All the situations seemed to ""magically"" turn things around in 6 months ending in a big promotion. I found this a bit patronizing. Need more examples of tactics, so what can I do differently..."
1,Vastly disappointing - a trite waste of time,"I read Amazon's excerpt and a couple of recommendations I thought I could trust before buying this book. It's worthless, obvious, hype-yourself-up, tired ""advice."" I resent that it is not worth the cost of shipping to return this book to Amazon, because I would otherwise do so. It doesn't rate space in my collection of thousands, nor would I give it as a gift to anyone I wanted to keep as a friend. I don't believe it would be of any actual harm, but I wouldn't want to waste their time. I'm donating the book - perhaps it might help someone who has lived such a stunted life they don't already know this stuff."

2,Poor design and execution,"A friend of mine has this box with the 15's in it. i have to say, this is the sort of thing you expect to find on clearance at Walmart because no smart shopper would buy them.There's barely enough air-space in this box for even one respectable 12 inch sub.. much less two 15's.A person could figure that two subs in a box for the price of most good/empty boxes would be a tad bit questionable.The only purpose i can see this serving is that someone with a single cab truck and a wide bench seat wants to say that they have 2 15's in their tiny cab. Save yourself some grief and humiliation and get a similar sized/shaped box, and throw in a shallow mounted Alpine 12 or something."
4,"good, worked as expected",This sensor worked as expected; my FLL team used it for various missions. I did not find anything wrong with it.
5,An inspirational adventure of our ancestral past and present,"Inanna Returns invites the reader to travel back in time to discover our ancestral beginnings in a story very different than that presented in the history books. Inspired by the works of Zecharia Sitchin, and enhanced by the author's own multidimensional experiences with Inanna herself, this book tells the story of the first humans and the ""gods and goddesses"" that created them.The characters come to life as we learn how 500,000 years ago in ancient Sumer our galactic ancestors genetically-engineered the human race for their own uses, then presented themselves as gods. The epic that ensues is rife with sibling rivalry, love, war, and cosmic secrets as the author expertly weaves the tales of Earth's history into an exciting adventure that captures the reader from beginning to end, with the promise of a sequel."
2,Big Disappointment,"Truely atrocious writing makes this book a chore to get through. I hoped Ferguson might give this ancient story some credible modern context, instead she gives us a bad soap opera. Individuals looking for someone or thing to blame for their problems will find that Ferguson has provided the ultimate excuse -- humans can't be better because our higher DNA functions have been turned off by Inanna and her family. But, don't wory, they're helping us fix that now. Forget Ferguson's mess and check out the ealier texts on Inanna -- the writing is better and so is the story."
4,"Great on content, just a little dry","If you're the ultimate policy wonk on 2nd Amendment law, you'll want to read this book just for John Knox's insights into the character of Justice McReynolds who wrote the decision in U.S. v. Miller, 1939. Unfortunately, Knox was no longer clerking for McReynolds in 1939, so we miss the inside story on that landmark decision, but after you've read this book you'll better understand why Miller makes so little sense."
5,Latin flavored zaniness is catchy,"This would be Esquivel's last large orchestra recording for RCA (until they released his unreleased LP in the late 1990s). All the tunes are Latin themed. Again he dazzles the listener with cool orchestrations and unusual pans across the stereo spectrum. All the top notch players are on board again from Bass Flute to screaming Trumpets (whatever happened to Louis Valizan, Esquivel's lead player?). Only available as an import and super hard to find, so get it if you find it! It is hard to put back on the shelf once you have heard it!"
3,The Damn! Show,"I ordered this dvd for my husband, he likes YUCKO THE CLOWN. On this dvd there is not enough YUCKO and the other sketches are not very funny. Check out YUCKO THE CLOWN on YouTube for funny interviews and better continuity on the YUCKO performances."
4,Amazing Book,I have an original print (1898) of this book. The descriptions of battles and participants of the actions is amazing. Many of the illustrations are in color. Who knew that the first officer killed in the Spanish-American War was Navy Ensign Worth Bagley and that he was the only naval officer killed in that war?While the condition is not perfect it is a fasinating book.
2,Blah,"I try to be a fan of his nonfiction, and this works most of the time. I tried to be a fan of his fiction, but it's terrible. Simple laguage that isn't lyrical or flowing at all. Sparse to the point of sounding like a high school student wrote it."
4,A true pleasure to read!,"In this slim volume of short fiction, Barry Lopez quietly evokes landscapes: of the earth, of the mind, and of the heart. Some stories, such as ""Stolen Horses,"" are simply told; others have a multi-layered richness. In ""The Mappist"" (my personal favorite), a man solves a mystery of pseudonymity as he tracks down a skilled mapmaker who alternately worked for the U.S. Geological Survey and secretly hand-drew elaborate, knowing maps accompanied by passionate text. Here, the reader glimpses the shape and color of the past, present, and future and what it means for two men who see them all in the lay of the land. ""The Letters of Heaven"" confronts the humanity of saints, and how one man reconciles passion and God. Not all stories are equally successful; in the title story the brutal conclusion seems oddly out of place, as though it belongs to another story. Still, these stories are artfully told, in language that sometimes startles with its simple beauty."
1,Light Action in the Caribbean,"Awful, just plain awful and disappointing. I am glad others were able to provide positive reviews, I must have read something else entirely. The stories were depressing and had no point."
2,"Eubanks Does It All (Well, For This Film)","Actually, this Grade B film wasn't too bad (nor too good), considering it's just that: Grade B. As I read somewhere, when the writer decides he's also going to be the lead actor, that's kind of sign the film may not be that great! I wonder if Corey Michael Eubanks also sold popcorn at the theaters during showings?This is pretty routine but it had a few intense action scenes, such as the beginning. How many people are escapees using a bus? And getting away! Come on!!!!After that interesting beginning, the film bogs down deeper and deeper and - snore - deeper, mainly because of the dumb romance angle with the typical no- brained, jealous, spoiled bully boyfriend.There are so many ""Payback"" movies, like Mel Gibson's, that surely you can find one a lot better than this one."
3,Coffee Table book with some good stories.,To be fair this book was never meant to be a in depth study on histories unsolved mysteries. It basically takes 25 stories and gives them a few pages each of basic information. Somewhat like a long wickepedia insert. There are a few cool stories such as who wrote Shakespeare's plays. But even that has been done in many other books. This book is for the person who does not read much into the weird or alternate histories. If you just want a fun easy to read book about some of the stranger moments in history then its a good buy.
5,Unsolved Mysteries of History by Paul Aron,"What a fun way to learn history!As in his earlier book on American history, Aron presents both sides of subjects that have puzzled historians for centuries. The chapters are concise, informative and clear. Especially interesting are the bibliographies which are also fun and show how historians have struggled to solve these mysteries."
1,"badly written, needs work","The author brings up controversies on which there realy isn't any disagreement. Did any of the Tsar's children survive? Their corpses have been found and DNA tests proved their authenticity. While his son's body was not among the bones it is unlikely that the kid survived. If he did, why didn't he leave russia, and claim the money which the russian royals stashed in swiss banks? The Tsar's son was a hemophiliac and couln't have survived into adulthood, as there was no treatment for hemophilia in those days. Why doesn't the author think of this? Was there a King Arthur? Maybe there was a celtic chief named Arthur or urther, and some silly monk used his name when writing a story. There's nothing to debate about. As for the other issues, the autor merely skims over them. He doesn't make any sensible conclusions, and the writing is poorly structured. Any high school student reading this book will know more about the material than the author."
1,was sent wrong book,it was the wrong book so i dont know what the one i wanted was really about the experience was not agood one
3,"True, Authentic Facts","Paul Aron has compiled some interesting stories based upon research in a number of areas. But for me, the greatest mystery is his editor's obvious lack of literary competency. The book's title, 'Unsolved Mysteries of History', is the most baffling, eye-opening example of tautology I've ever seen. By definition, a mystery is something 'unsolved' and historically placed. Perhaps when the book was proof-read, the editor was overseas in a foreign country at a particular time."
4,Great practice,"I love almost everything about this dvd... the lovely setting (on the beach)... the background music (Japanese flute). Diane gives very clear detailed instructions that I could follow the practice without looking at the screen. The practice is mixed between easy relaxation and invigorating poses that challenge your core...just right.The only con is that there is no chapter but overall the dvd is so good that I could ignore that issue. However, I think it's worth mentioning."
3,Slow pace and relaxing,This workout is approx. 1 hour long. It is unusual because you start out seated and do poses like seated forward bend right away before you progress to a few standing poses at the end. The pace is slow and relaxing.
5,The Greatest Compilation since the NOW line !,"This 2 disc set, in my opinion, is the greatest compilation since the ""Now Thats Music"" series. The only difference is, this compilation is for us DANCE MUSIC LOVERS! This cd combines many types of dance music, including progressive, trance, house... and more!I have listened to this cd many times [before it was released] and I'm here to say that this is a must have for all you party kids. This cd will be loved by all, glitter boys and raver kids alike ! Grab this cd as soon as possible !"
5,Awesome Guitar Teacher!!,"The advice given on this dvd is awesome!! Arlen Roth's style is a combo of country and rock. So get ready for a lot of Country/Rock licks. It's almost to much country for me! But thats me. The details on soloing are what matters! You better have some music theory training in your back pocket before trying this!! Some of the advice given is so deep in theory I had to stop the dvd and think for a few minutes before continuing. I've been playing 40 yrs. with adv. music theory in my back pocket. So beware!! You could probably grow into this in time, but it would be an adventure! This is not beginner friendly!!"
1,"A Bad, Bad Movie","Wow, the acting was unconvincing, the dialogue was terrible, and the plot was ridiculous. Even if you were desperate for entertainment I wouldn't recommend this movie. Why bother to argue about the message of the movie when the movie itself was so poorly executed. Watch ""Generation Kill"" instead. It at least has some real soldiers playing soldiers and giving direction/assistance."
1,bad,"just horrible. did not know middle east had the same vegetation of canada? That is the ""good"" problem. Acting, directing, and stupidity are the real problems. ""so if the shi* goes down so be it"" and ""No buts thats and order"" such realism and awesome dialogue!Also what a title. That must have taken years!No life or commen sense in this crap of a movie. I hate war movies that have no life. Sorry guys but it bothers people when their friends and fellow soldiers are hurt or killed. They have a job to do but to go on with the trying to be witty FRIENDS, the tv show, style comments just falls less than flat.Do not rent or see this. just hit your head on wall for a few hours and you will be better off. ""so why they mad we here?"" "" because nobody likes to be occupied because it is like living with your parents"" ACADEMY AWARD FOR WRITING HERE WE COME!"
3,Modern Combat,"the films action sequences are good but thats pretty much all the it has going for it. Based on the war in Iraq, it follows a team of US Soldiers into battle against the terrorists. Its a rent first movie."
4,"Welcome Back, VI","I am an unabashed fan of female detective novels, and Sara Paretsky is one of my favorites. This is a terrific read - one I hated to put down. As usual, the characters - even minor ones - were vivid, people you knew or might know. I eagerly waited for the story to unfold. Too often, when a popular novelist decides to ""raise our consciousness"" with social issues, the result is a failure; not so in this case. Paretsky draws a picture of Coolis, a fictional prison, that made me uncomfortable. I felt concern - even as I eagerly turned the page to see the plot unfold. This is a well-crafted piece of work and a satisfying mystery."
4,Another Great Book from Sara Paretsky!,"I always enjoy novels by Sara Paretsky. Hard Time, although an excellent book, it may not be as engaging as her others, but it is definitley a very different book. V.I. is actually put into prison and you get a frist hand account of her horrors and dangers within. Definitley action packed, with a little more violence than usual. Overall an excellent book definitley worth reading."
5,I really loved this book,I just want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I like reading about the good fight V. I. is fighting and all the hardships she has to endure. My life is quite tame so that makes it all the more interesting for me to read about it in a book. I couldn't put this book down; I found it to be adventurous and suspenseful. I've read all the V. I. books and this one is my favorite. I'm so glad she's back!
4,As good as ever,"This is a good read in the Paretsky/VI tradition: plenty of pace, readable, and gripping. The author has lost none of her touch, and the characters, not least VI herself, come across as very real. To take one example, VI has to earn a living, and so we get a detour to Georgia. Also, the prison scenes are vivid and well drawn, if very disturbing.Note the emergence of the ""wise priest"" figure at the end: and VI becoming a regular attender at mass. Are we to expect a Chesterton/Graham Greene/Piers Paul Reid type of scenario in future?"
2,I Agree with James!,"I considered writing a lengthly review but ""James"" in ""New Rochelle"" did it for me! Thanks James. I will only add that, although I will certainly read the next Paretsky novel, I surely hope she refrains from the endless, rather gruesome, prison descriptions."
4,"Good dogs ,smart women, and good detecting","Having enjoyed most of the V.I. Warshawski stories I looked forward to this long awaited novel.I couldn't put this book down and lost most of a night's sleep.This reader identified with the angst of aging,desertion of friends when needed most, and the companionship of two great dogs.The P.I.comes across a body in the road,and subsequently all sorts of strange things happen to her. She is harrassed by the police,deserted by her assistant,framed, and eventually meets someone to help her.This is quite an adventure;some of the jail scenes are out of the believable range. I found this one of the best reads this year. I thought that some of the excessive feminism of earlier novels had disappeared. Now V.I. express insecurities and doubts,strengths and weaknesses,loss and gain. A very good story with plenty of action."
1,HOGWASH! Unbelievable story-line!!,"Is any reader with any sense of credibility expected to believe that this ""tough talking, justice seeking"" P.I. has allowed herself to be so compromised by just about everyone whose path she crosses? Anyone who is supposedly as strong willed and righteous would never have allowed herself to be so abused to accomplish the same end she could have in so many other ways armed with the data she had available to her. This is my first V.I. and, unless anyone can tell me that this was the worst of the lot and that previous efforts by Ms. Paretsky were more worthy, I will never purchase another."
2,"After waiting 5 years, I was disappointed.","Sara Paretsky's book ""Windy City Blues"" was the first female detective story I had read since Nancy Drew and I loved it. Unfortunately, as I read through her entire series, her books got darker and more bitter. ""Hard Time"" is no exception. The plot gets buried in bitterness, against so many people, associations, and even class systems. Because of this, the book was a disappointment."
1,Hard read,"Paretsky needs to let V.I. grow up. A character in a continuing series is interesting and believable only if allowed to mature and grow, i.e., learn from their experiences. Throughout the book V.I. reminds us her body is aging -- at least something is changing about her. I found the characterizations extreme and the plot predictable as well as melodramatic. Paretsky needs to choose another vehicle for a diatribe about prison issues."
3,Okay but....,"Maybe I am too picky by half, but this was my first Parensky novel, and it really didn't inspire me to pick up any more. This book is too long - I felt that the prison sequence was necessary, but that the ending was just tacked on for a climatic confrontation between the bad guy and VI. The minor characters were entertaining, but I felt the villians to be one-dimentional. Entertaining, but not very substantive."
2,Could have been better,I was alittle disappointed in this book. It seemed to drag on and on and the story was very preditable.
5,Hard Time,I believe this was the first book with V.I. Was glad to get to read it having read several later books. Paretsky is my favorite author. V.I. is very exciting character. Always really takes her jobs seriously and really is exciting.
2,Bummer,"Have waited for another of Paretsky's page turners, still waiting after this one. Had to wake myself up to turn the page, what could have been an excellent plot became very convaluted, too many twists, turns & people going nowhere. We all know she can and will do better next time."
2,My first Paretsky novel and probably my last.,"It took me a third of the book to figure out it wasn't going to get any better but by that point I had to hang in there to find out how it would end. But getting to the end was so boring and tedious. I guess I just don't ""get"" this V.I. character. I found her to be abrasive and with a huge chip on her shoulder. How does this girl manage to maintain any friendships? And she kept getting herself into absolutely ridiculous situations--does she have a brain in her head? I found the whole plot difficult to believe and boring to boot. I think V.I. needs a new line of work, not only for herself but also for her friends sake."
2,Good reading but dubious issues,"I liked some things about this book, however I am astonished by liberal ideas that Paretsky tried to squeeze in. Why is being rich bad? Why should everyone help an illegal immigrant? Why should we support illegals? Half of prison contingent is illegal, so let them work, they came to this country, broke our laws, and why should they not be punished for it? How come good neighborhood and beautiful houses are shameful, but criminally entering this country and stealing from people are not shameful? I think that Paretsky has some perverted sense of justice. I did not like a lot in this book, and I think that maybe better editing was needed. This was not supposed to be a book with social doctrines and divide and split ideas. It was supposed to be easy mystery/detective story."
1,This one won't keep you up at night,V.I. is hard to like. A bitter abrasive character whose only kind words are to a child. A silly plot and hurried ending make this a big disapointment. I haven't read a less satisfying book for a long while.

4,"C.D. Collins is a wonder, a true American original.","C.D. Collins is a performance poet who has set her lyrical and sometimes wry observations on life, death and dysfunctional families to the complementary rhythms of the band Pincurl. Even if you don't like poetry, you'll dig this. Don't worry--this is not Rod McKuen. This stuff rocks!"
5,For fans of fusion and erotic funk,"This album involves various styles, but most of the tracks are a blend of 70s-everything. Tracks 3 and 5 are perfect for intimate moments with another human being. Highly emotional atmospheres!"
4,BLACK but WHITE,"a interesting stylistic interpretation of sounds from the seventies,grooves on a Barry White style,the final touch of Monsieur Ludovic is omnipresent, but not as resolute in his variations as 'the' Tourist album."

1,Where's the soul??,"Why did I bother with this CD? It's truly hard to sit through even if you're just looking for background music. Monotonous and trite, each track, built on programmed beats, is more empty than the next. I've heard it all before. The last track finally gives us a glimmer of originality , but its too little too late."
1,review Brazilian street soccer,I thought this would be a documentary on Brazilian street soccer. Instead it is a compilation of amateur shots of street soccer without any commentary. Easy money for makers of a useless product. I feel really cheated. This is an outrage of how to get people buying a product which is totally worthless. Please do not be fooled. I was fooled and I will advice everybody who thinks on buying: your money is waisted on something you do not want.
3,Connecting Heaven to Earth - Angels and Fairies,"This is a book written by an author who believes the difference between angels and fairies is simply a question of size. She goes on to discus the types of angels and a wide variety of angelic beliefs. She cites areas in the Bible that mention angels and details their work and purpose.It's an interesting book, recommended primarily for those who are curious about angelic origins and their connection to fairy."
1,Poorly written,"This book was a disappointment. It contains some basic information but very little of use for anyone other than a novice. Worse, many of the captions and passages are just plain wrong."
1,Not For Fisherman,"A waste of money if you are looking for a serious book about Big Game fishing. The section entitled 'Playing The Fish' extends fully to all of one-half of one page! If you don't know which end of the rod to hold, this book is for you."
3,Not a handbook,"The book is not a handbook, Wonderful photos and discriptions but this book belongs on a coffie table, not on a boat as a handbook."
3,worked ok,"having some issues with growing success. some dead plants. but, new at whole process of hydro, product does well, and was as advertised"
2,Not a good example of his work,"Not one of my favorite Zorn records. There are nice moments, and the CD has a nice spare, quiet sound, but hardly ever gets beyond that, which is the big fault. Zorn's style doesn't lend itself to much development, and there is no solid focus at the core of the CD to maintain much interest through an hour or so of this short, whispy bits. The ultimate effect is one of boredom. Any other film music CD of his would be preferable and display the same style that is both over and underdone here."
1,"interesting concept, unreadable execution.","I agree fully with the persons who couldn't get into this book. It was poorly and bizarrely executed. The unending pointless exchanges between characters were barely understandable. I found myself rereading dialogue many times just trying to follow it - and it was often meaningless to the overall story. Finally I gave up and skipped to the fairly banal ending. This was a sadly mishandled story, unworthy of the time taken to read it."
2,Pretty Good Game,"The game is pretty fun, but it is very frustrating to set up and having to keep setting up! I don't play very often and when i do maybe 1 game! I say this is not a keeper"
2,Try to Find this on CD-ROM,"This game requires way too much setup. It is difficult to take out the number card without accidentally pulling out the prize card underneath it. The only fun part about Concentration is, of course, trying to figure out the secret phrase. This would be a perfect computer game for the memory part of the game. I know I've seen in on a 512k version 10+ years ago, but I haven't seen a new computer version. I couldn't imagine an 8 year old having the patience to setup this game and play the memory part, but then again maybe an 8 year old has an hour to waste on setup whereas I do not."
4,Concentration: the older years.,"I think concentration is a very wonderful game, because I love Rebus puzzle.I never watched the old version of concentration,I only remember watching ''Classic Concentration'' which AlexTrebek hosted on NBC 1n 1987-1991, and the show was a lot of fun and I think I became inspired by the show, so that's why I recommend that you buy this game."
5,Brain Power = Concentration,Concentration - a great game! It's a lot of fun to play and adds brain power to your memory. Just like I remember it from the 70's. I love it!!!
2,Outside of expectations.,"This album is a bit of an enigma-- John ZOrn and Yamantaka Eye in duet typically perform with a fire and energy quite uncommonly found-- this record instead is largely an ambient album, with atmosphere and noise synthesis far outweighing energy.This isn't to say there's not quite a bit of interesting music on here, opener ""Eep Man"", featuring lounge sax and Eye's punctuated screams is certainly catching, and ""Propoltion"" is fantastic, but mostly its Eye chanting (""Test Tube""), moaning (""Thank You For Not Thinking"", ""Pulp Wars""), babbling (""Damascus"") or whimpering (""Yoga Dollar"") over samples and ambient sounds. And then there's the infamous ""Bad Hawkwind""-- 18 minutes of sampled and looped Eye screaming that seems kind of amusing at first but starts grating.Its not a bad album, but its not particularly good either-- if you're interested in exploring the partnership of these two, check out the live set thats part of the Zorn 50th birthday concert series."
3,1/2 good,"25 minutes of really good Eye and Zorn. The 18 minute Bad Hawkwind however is just plain bad. 18 minutes of hardly changing white noise. I like stuff like Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music and the first two Earth CDs, that noise is interesting, the song Bad Hawkwind is just plain boring. The rest of the CD is great, if you don't mind buying the CD for about 25 minutes of music."
5,FUSION OF HIP HOP AND DANCE AT ITS BEST,"hausmarke and dj thomilla from the legendary german hip hop crew ""die fantastischen vier"" are really going new ways. after spinning together in many clubs in germany as the ""turntablerocker"" this is their first cd. and it REALLY ROCKS. fusion of HIP HOP and many different dance styles like funk, house, drum and bass,big beat, elektro and some latin. most of the tracks are just instrumental, and that's good like this, it's just the concept of those two geniuses, which goes way beyond hip hop."
1,"""worst of class""","Again, Corel fails to step up to the plate and provide anything innovative to designers. A lackluster effort on the part of the Canadian software company (do they not talk to their customers???). Stick with CorelDRAW 8.PhotoPaint is throwaway software stuffed in the box so you don't feel too cheated. Go ahead, feel cheated anyway. If you've ever used Photoshop, this poor-man's clone is apt to leave you frustrated and (possibly) violent towards the developers.Hopefully Corel will focus *all* its efforts on DRAW and not on all the silly extras in the box next time."
3,Interface,I've just installed CorelDRAW 10 on my PC and my first thought is : TOO MUCH. There must be about a billion options on the screen at the same time. The interface is confusing (unlike Adobe Illustrator 10). I'll give it a try but I doubt it will replace Illustrator...
5,COREL IS THE ONLY TOOL,......here is the deal. What takes 2 hours in Illustrator/Quark and Photoshop can be done in 10 minutes in CorelDraw. Just because it's capibility enhanced Corel 10 has improved its colour issues in this version and now IS the best overall illustration/layout tool in the business of Graphic Design. It took Adobe and Macromedia 5 years to catch up to the technology...
4,Top notch power - you'll need the service pack though.,"I've used Corel Draw since version 5 and I've always been pretty happy with each release. CorelDraw 10 has all the features I've ever dreamed of and I find myself very productive with it.The one complaint I have of version 10 is stability, however. I've run it on 3 different PC platforms and find I must reboot after and hour or so of heavy use. I believe there are some big memory leaks in version 10.There is a service pack now available for version 10 so I'd recommend downloading it and appylying it."
1,Expected better....,"Based on the review I thought this book would be a great book, but it wasn't. This story is boring and there is nothing in it to grab at your attention. It took me forever to finish this book, and when I did read it I skimmed through a lot of the paragraphs. I have read a lot of Anne Mathers book and this is not one of her best."
3,Don't buy if you expectin season 3 and 4,"The anime series is alrigth but suck since it finished in a point where nobody happy. Please let email funimation to dub the rest, until they do because japan have fifthy more episode."
5,Another version of this CD,"This CD is also part of a compilation:Caldara: Medea - Stradella: Motets / Piau, Lesne, Il Seminario musicaleFor a lower price, you will get the CD featured on this page, andStradella : Motets / Piau, Lesne, Il Seminario musicale"
3,IT'S A PLAY,"First I will say it is unfair for me to review this film as a white male who watched 20-30 minutes and turned it off. The movie is a play with your basic overhead shot. It also shows characters with ear/mouth pieces hooked to boxes. There is music and comedy with some sexual references. Our main character has a hunk of a bf which she uses for sex, but the guy is a lot of talk. Her family fixes her up with a man who has wealth, but he may not be the legal businessman he pretends to be. It was at this point I couldn't watch any more. The fact that it was done on a stage for a theater distracted me from the film as well as the severe lack of action. Worse than Sister Act 2 in my book. I am sure there is a niche for this type of stage drama-musical-comedy, but it was not my cup of tea."
1,Lame writing.,The Last of the Texas Rangers out of print SF-Action series still rules. The Whistlers contains some of the lamest wrting style I've ever seen. At least the rangers novels have some wry humor interlaced within their grim pages -- to leaven up the reading a bit.
2,too basic,"Purchased this item for the elderly parents as an alternative to the expensive PC system we'd bought for them to use for web and e-mail - and which was too complicated. This system seemed simple enough and covered all my parents' needs.We were very disappointed. This unit IS simple to set up and easy to use. However, this unit is truly basic. It runs an outdated version of Internet Explorer (version 3 or 4). The home screen feels old - the closest equivalent would be the original version of Prodigy back in the late '80's.More importantly, because it runs an antique version of Explorer AND has no memory, many web sites won't load or will be missing large chunks. If you want to read foreign language newspapers or sites - forget it - this system has no extended fonts.This system has potential, but they need to upgrade the software. I would not recommend purchasing this item unless all you want is e-mail capability; you will find it frustrating if you use it for web-surfing."
2,"slow, but easy; expensive, old name 'webtv'","this is the old 'webtv' that everyone knows. it is slow compared to other internet items; its either 33k speed or 56k depending on which you buy; the custoner service is ok but LONG time on the phone on hold; the price is about $$$ a month on a credit card, thats the Only way they ley you pay. i got tired of the monthly credit card bills so it sits under my couch now for 2 yrs. i am now using cidco email device with earthlink, for $$ bux a month, all paid up for a yr., in one payment. otherwise a fine item for the internet-frightened, to get started."
1,Just like the Yugo..........,"Do you remember the Yugo? It was the cheapest car that you could buy in America, and it was proof that you got what you paid for. This is the same with MSNTV. There really isn't very much wrong with hardware. It does what it was designed to do. The problem is that the software does not permit it to do very much.WebTV came on to the market back in 1996 and I had the service for several years. More recently the product has been re-branded as MSN TV. The only thing that has changed is the name on the box. The technology, I am sad to say, is virtually obsolete.Look at it this way: if you enjoy watching television on a 5 in. black-and-white TV with poor reception, you'll love MSN TV.With generosity, I give the service one star.By the way, this review is being dictated using the IBM ViaVoice software that I have installed on my iMac."
1,Didn't work,"We bought this several years ago to have batteries for a digital camera. Simply put, the batteries didn't hold a charge very long, so my wife always had the thing drawing power in a wall socket. Even at that, we could only take a few pictures before they lost charge. I'm trying again with Duracell, but this one fails."
1,"Charger get thumbs down, batteries get thumbs up",From day one this charger never worked! It just blinked which means there was a problem. I finally broke down and bought a different Energizer charger and it works great! The batteries that came with this particular charger work fine in the new one. BIG thumbs down on this charger!
2,charger works ok but ...,"It comes with 2 2500mAh AA batteries, and 2 AAA batteries. not the advertised 4 AA batteries. I personally have no need for AAA batteries. I specifically ordered this charger because it was supposed to come with 4 AA batteries."
5,its perfect,Bought this for a family member after purchasing them a digital camera. It's easy to use and travels well. They still use it with no problems. We also own the same charger for our Wii and it hasn't failed us yet. The 3 color option for the charger I found a bit odd. But now that I leave the charger plugged in all the time. I did try to match the charger color to the room! The charger has a green light when it's finshed charging and red light while it's charging
1,Waste of money,"I've had this for almost 6 month and i really regret buying this piece of junk,i cannot blame the charger it is doing its job but the batteries doesnt hold long enought charges and it runs out of juice pretty quickly,ive bought rechargable duracell batteries and it hold longer charges and it last longer,dont waste money on this just buy duracell stuff."
3,Caution - on what the unit DOESN'T DO !,"Received the unit in good shape. After programming the unit and reading the instructions. Only after calling the help line, did I found out that the unit will NOT DIAL OUT FOR EMERGENCY by pushing the pendant button. You have to purchase a $39.95 + $8.00 S&H to get the pendant that does that OR get the Model #200. The Model 100 can't ONLY answer the phone with its pendant."
1,FAILS EVERY OTHER TEST CALL,You need to be right next to the telephone set in order for the pendant to trigger an emergency call. More than 50 unobstructed feet it fails about one half of the time.
1,"""EMERGENCY"" PENDANT THAT ONLY RECEIVES CALLS","The Telemergency ClearVoice 100 Emergency Telephone is NOT an emergency system at all! The Pendant only receives incoming phone calls--IT DOES NOT PLACE A 911 CALL FROM THE PENDANT. Further, the rather worthless Pendant has a range from the base unit of only 20 feet. Many other brands have a TWO-WAY transmission range of 600 feet or more.If this system does what you want it to do, fine. But may I suggest a cordless telephone system for a wee bit more?Should you desire a TRUE emergency system, check out theFreedom Alert II Newest Dect Model 600 Foot Range-FreedomAlert, available right here on Amazon.com. Now THAT is a REAL EMERGECY SYSTEM. Please trust me on this one!L. Brown, Virginia"
5,Very good karaoke,A must have fof both karaoke and Carpenters fans. A very good selection of songs and the voice overs are very good.
2,Sophomoric sampler,"2 1/2Expected eclectic surprises abound, but the early score compilation is far from required, basically offering crude outtakes of what he would further articulate."
4,One Of Petra's Heavier Offerings,"Throughout their thirty-plus years as a band, Petra has had quite a number of member changes. With that, of course, comes a varied musical styling on each of their albums. ""Wake-Up Call"" falls into the heavier category of Petra's catalogue of albums. Although their last studio album, ""Jekyll and Hyde,"" is probably their heaviest album, ""Wake-Up Call"" is not too far behind. This is shown through powerful arena rock tunes like ""Sleeping Giant"" and ""Midnight Oil."" Other heavier tunes on this album include ""Strong Conviction"" and ""Underneath The Blood."" Of course, no Petra album would be complete without a couple of ballads, and the tunes that fit the bill here are ""Just Reach Out"" and ""Marks Of The Cross.""Fans of Petra's ""Beyond Belief"" album and ""No Doubt"" will definitely enjoy this album. It has a very good balance of powerful arena rock and lighter ballads. It's one of Petra's best John Schlitt-era albums and is definitely worthy of purchase.Highly recommended."
2,Not one of their better moments.,"I have been a fan since 1986. I enjoy most of Petra's output. This disc has its moments, but overall it is pretty dull. I hate to say it but its true. On the positive side ""Midnight Oil"" and ""Underneath The Blood"" are pretty good. ""Reach Out"" is a catchy, uplifting tune. The rest is pretty forgettable and by this time in the 90's sounding more than a few years out of date. Not essential."
5,they rock,i love doodles bears. they are so cute and you can draw about anything on them. sometimes i write phone numbers so i dont forget and i write things on it that i dont want to forget. also i draw things that are just fun! this doodle bear isnt just fun its also usefull! i got it a week ago and its still fun. its not only for 6 year olds. you can play it when your 13 or over. because im 13! anyway doodle bears are great. you should get one for yourself!
4,Article 99 Film Review,Article 99 is a fresh story that needs to be told as it keeps on the lines of the truth. The story its self is very enjoyble and with a cast that is so well put together this film never goes down hill. It will keep your attention from start to finish as you will be left thinking about this truly magnification story that will stay in your head for weeks.
1,video doesn't work in usa,mars doesn't realize when they see a usa adress so they send a different county move to usa i will not ever order moves from them again
1,NOT Happy about wrong DVD being sent article 99,I am far from pleased. The DVD would not play as the wrong region was sent to me....so I had to send it back. Have not found another one and have yet to see my credit return....very frustrating and time consuming. Unnecessary postage....yuk I need region 1 united states I believe
1,Bane Review,"Wow what a LOW budget stinker. Basically, they use a cheap sound stage somewhere in the UK, with British Actresses to bore the hell out of you. I almost thought about turning it off but since I paid 3.99 I thought 'Lets ride this out'. I rented it on Amazon Video on Demand I didnt want to totaly waste my money, sadly I did."
2,"Structure fine, colors not","There's nothing wrong with the manufacturing or quality - the item seems well made and its structure is basically the same as shown in the picture. But the colors are nothing like what is shown. In reality, it is much darker, less kid-like. The ""red"" coral on the right is really a deep purple; the ""yellow"" smokestack looking things are really green; the ""light blue"" flower like things on the left are really a dark copper/burnt orange; the small ""purple"" flowers are blue and yellow; the ""light purple"" brain-like looking things at the bottom are blue and a little purple, but much darker than in the picture; the little ""yellow"" flowers are red. The remaining parts are a couple shades of deep, deep forest green.It was for a 7 year old, so I am very disappointed."
1,Horrible product.,The color was a little bit more dull than in the pictures. Disapointing but I decided I would still keep it.Bad idea. Should have returned it. As soon as I started to rinse it before putting in the tank a horrible rank resin smell took over the whole kitchen! It was so bad there was no way I was going to put it in my tank with my fish. I had to put it out on the porch it was so bad! No way would I buy anther one. Horrible waste of money.
1,"Inaccurate picture, careless packaging.","This product was cracked in half probably before it was even shipped to me because it doesn't even fit in the product box. The amazon box was not smashed in, so I don't see how it would even be possible for it to be broken in shipping because it's some tough plastic! I feel like I got ripped off, just sending me broken things and knowing shipping back would be to expensive for what it's worth.As for the product itself it's not as good looking as the picture, or as bright, the colors are different and seems to be hand painted by someone who is in a rush or not getting paid enough for what they do."
3,Itz a nice look for a 55 gallon tank or simalar..,I would like to have it come in a 15inch or simalar size due to me having a 110 gallon tank. But it gets the Job done.
3,Mystery solved,"More a series of notes than a well-structured treatise and somewhat repetitive. However, the Book provides a good insight into who these Knights were, where they came from, how they operated, and why the Church and Kings were so keen to get rid of them. Without having this background, a cultural tour of the Baltic States and Poland makes little sense and the history seems mind-numbingly complex."
1,The Teutonic Knights,I found this book lacking in terms of being a military history. It was a good political history of the knights and their kingdom. Details on militay campaigns and battles were lacking. A good understanding of the political underpinning of military situations were presented. Perhaps such insights are more important in understanding the rise and fall of the knights than military operations.
5,The true story of the Christian order of Teutonic Knights of central Europe during the medieval era,"The Teutonic Knights: A Military History is the true story of the Christian order of Teutonic Knights of central Europe during the medieval era. Covering roughly the 1200's through the 1500's, including the order's rise and fall, The Teutonic Knights examines both the order's strengths and its inequities, which have been to some degree exaggerated by propagandists, nationalists, secularists, and Protestants. A handful of black-and-white photographic plates illustrate this meticulously documented historical text, embellished with a bibliography and index. The Teutonic Knights brings the era and daily life alive, as surely as it illuminates power struggles between factions, Christian orders, noblemen, and nations, and is a superb contribution to medieval and military history shelves."
3,Two favorites not included,"I was disappointed to see that two desserts that my Italian mom made every year were not included. They are Struffoli (honey balls) and Pastiera di Grano (Easter Wheat Pie). My former landlord used to put in ""his order"" months before Christmas and Easter for them since he hated the bakery ones.The butter listed did not indicate salted or unsalted, but according to the list of ingredients used in the beginning of the book, it did only list fresh unsalted butter. It would have been better to specifically list the correct ingredients since unfortunately, most people do not entirely read the preceding pages.The lack of pictures was not really a problem for me, though it would have been nice to see some of the finished items."
5,Excellent Cookbook,"I love this book, in fact I also bought the Cookie Tray one, the recipes are excellent."
1,Still waiting,"Several weeks have passed, and still waiting for Amazon to ship the book that was listed as in stock and available"
3,"I think this should read 1/4"" TRS connectors.","According to Pyle's site, the PPSN827 has 1/4"" connectors on it. NOT 1/8"". But, considering the 1/8"" is repeated here in the description of this item, it has me double-guessing Pyleaudio.com."
3,Scholarly Read about Marlowe's Era,"This is a scholarly book about the life and times of playwright Christopher Marlowe. It is not an entertaining easy read. I read about 20% of the book before giving up. It's erudite, but still comprehensible. It just wasn't that interesting to me.In the first 82 pages, I found maybe two pages worth of information about Marlowe as a person. In contrast, there are maybe 10 pages about the town he was born in and at least 40 pages about the educational system he grew up with.I would not recommend this book for those who read biographies for just for fun. Nor would I recommend it for someone who wants to read about famous gay people. The author concludes that he probably had little contact with women, so he was either celibate or had homosexual sex.I've read and enjoyed detailed biographies like this, when I have had a greater interest in the culture and times. For those readers, this is probably a great book."
1,FAKE SPOONS. BEWARE!,"The spoons in this set are practically flat, which defeats the purpose of them altogether. There are many better inexpensive options you can get instead. Read reviews first though. Otherwise it's impossible to choose a good set that won't rust or fall apart quickly."
3,Cheap,"My ex and I bought this less than 3 years ago at TJMaxx for about 20 bucks to go with our Florida/tropical decor. After several runs through the dishwasher, they have tarnished and cracked and I'm looking into buying a new set now. They we're nice for a short while as they obviously serve their purpose, but don't expect them to last long."
1,...and the truth is ugly,"I'm glad i only paid 4 bucks for this. 30 min. of alternating between the E and F chords with three guys shouting about injustice, animals and hatred. ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZ. Victory records has got to be the worst the label on earth, seriously. The cover looks like really bad death metal artwork (or similar to the Laughing Dog/Ear Bleeding Disorder split 7"" for those who know that). This is the kind of music that makes people hate straight-edgers."
4,Not to bad,Good hardcore CD. This cd is all hardcore with some powerful tunes about animals (the singer being a vegan) and some straightedge tunes.
2,not what i expected,"i expected these to fit like the seamless kinds, but they have a thick band at the waist. product did arrive on time, of course."
1,never received them,I never got them. I believe they were out of stock and I received a refund. Too bad because they looked nice!
4,Not quite what I wanted,"Recd item quickly. Nicely packaged. great item. Wasnt quite what I wanted. My fault, I didnt read carefully."
5,The Best Panties yet...,These are truly the best panties I have ever purchased. I will buy them again and again. Feels like wearing nothing at all.
3,Synopsis,"In this collection of novellas, Kimberly Zant delves into hidden desires and pulse-pounding suspense, each so seductive, you'll want to savor every word.The Prey: Emerald was not immune to Reece's charms ... even when he was her student and definitely off limits ... When he reappears in her life, ready to take up where they left off, she finds him impossible to resist. But someone else from her past has returned, as well, with deadly intentions.The Shaman: A savage attack draws special agent Charlotte Boyer to the reservation where she encounters the shaman--John Greywolf, who is as mysterious and dangerous as his namesake.Seduction: Tall and dark-with the looks and build of a male super model-the brooding gaze that hides Cole Macquire's dark past only makes him infinitely more dangerous and irresistible.Rating: Contains explicit sex, graphic language, and graphic violence."
3,Zorn adds another Filmworks!,"On the Filmworks discs, you can never be sure what you'll find: surf guitar, covers of Ennio Morricone, freejazz, waltzes of death, punk rock, pipe organ stuff... This one is no surprise. There are two halves to this cd. The first accompanies a Jewish documentary and is based on the feel of Masada/Bar Kokhba, with such players as Erik Friedlander on cello, Anthony Coleman on piano and Marc Ribot on guitar. The second half is the soundtrack to Latin Boys Go To Hell, about discovering sexuality. It is all percussion, with Kenny Wollesen and Cyro Baptista. This made more sense after seeing the film, and is evidently a great soundtrack. Check it out!"
5,Hitachi's Greatness !!!!!!!!!,"I bought this TV from Circuit City, after debating what brand should I get. Actually, Sony, Panasonic, and Hitachi were my best choices, but after seeing the picture on this set, nothing could tell best than your own eyes. I was amazed how deep were the colors, brigh was the picture and most importantly how fast do they service you, and over all 10/10. Plus it's a great value for such a beatifull set. My recomandation; BUY IT !!!!!"
1,Hitachi projection TVs are garbage!!!,"If you want to throw away a lot of money, this is the TV for you! You could just mail your money to me as it would be a better use of it, but I doubt you want to do that. I fell victim to a Hitachi projection TV. It is a little over two years old and is ready for the landfill. Don't believe me? Search Hitachi projection television and see for yourself. They are great televisions when new, but once they hit the two year mark you should start looking for a new TV!"
1,Don't buy a Hitachi HDTV,"We have had this TV for three years. Two days ago red swirl lines appeared across the screen. It is impossible to get someone to come and take a look at the TV and Hitachi customer service was no help. After reading other comments from customers, it is clear that other Hitachi customers are having the same issues. We spent 2 grand on this TV and are extremely disappointed and will never buy another Hitachi."
3,WWII Propaganda,"Rather lengthy scenarios on why U.S.went to war during WWII. Demonizing Japanese and Germans involved. Actual accounts of some key battles is good. Overall, a good but not spectacular collection of important conflicts in Europe and the Pacific."
1,"pure dribble,all in dark,rotten audio","This is the biggest bunch of dribble I have ever seen. I think the whole film was shot in the dark. Even if meg ryan tryed to show something you would sure never see it. This has lousy audio, you can't hear snything and all of a sudden they try to break your eardrums with some car sound of something else dumb. I have no idea why meg ryan made this mess, If she needs money this bad mabe she should take up bartending"
1,"""In The Cut' should've been left on the floor","In the Cut we get to finally get to see Meg Ryan In The RAW. Meg looked fantastic, but what a disappointment!! If Meg wanted to do a nude scene, I'm all for it, but she wasted it on this dark, depressing, and very boring film. It was slow and very predictable. (...) If for what ever reason you have to see this movie, rent it. Buying it is a waste of $20. Watching it is a waste of 2 hours. Meg if you're reading this do yourself a favor and get Ashley Judd's agent to get you some roles in some good movies. Meg is one of my favorite actresses but this film is a stinker."
1,Horrible,"This movie was unbelieveable, overacted, and dull. I think Meg wanted to show a different side of her, and she did.... A naked one. This would have been greet during the HArry Met Sally Days but now this 40 something is not so hot. Skip it and save yourself money/time."
1,About as bad as it gets,"Weird, slow, boring. I guess it's supposed to by a mystery thriller, but I wouldn't call it a thriller. I've been falling asleep all movie long. The ending is marginally interesting, but also weak and not thought through. Get this only if you want to see Meg Ryan naked (unless it was her body double). Otherwise this moive is pretty worthless. One of those horrible ""all-star"" movies with Meg Ryan, Kevin Bacon, produced by Nicole Kidman pretty much for the three of them to enjoy - not for anybody else."
2,Mark Ruffalo shows he is in the cut.,"This review is for the Unrated DVD version. Mature adults only. Same plot we have seen before in hundreds of other who-done-it crime-drama films. No suspense here. Mark Ruffalo showing his erected thing in bed doesn't really bother me, but maybe that is where they got the title of this film from. Hey, how about the phallus-double Jane Champion had to cast. Simulated work of course. But sex scene was crucial for the film since it contained ""the clue""."
1,Would the real Meg Ryan please stand up?,"Unfortunately, they don't let me put 0 stars, but that's what my rating is. It should be negative stars! This is by FAR the MOST GOD AWFUL, WORST movie around!!! Meg Ryan is known for her adorable, cutesy roles and she certainly does a 180 in this movie. Seeing her in this role, of a school teacher by day, slut by night was such a shock, it ruined the entire movie. Add to that the boring plot and not so wonderful costars and you've got a night from hell. I would definitely not waste a cent on this movie!!"
2,Amazingly TERRIBLE movie...SO SO BAD!,"What is amazing about this terrible movie is that the movie itself was well-executed. There was suspense, and the acting was well done. However, the story line was...non-existant? There was zero character development, and the audience was not compelled to care about anything in the movie even momentarily. And then, the movie just ended...stupidly. This was so bad that it's not even a rental. It is just breathtakingly terrible and is completely irredeemable. So so bad.Everyone leaving the theater was making fun of the member of their party who had chosen the movie. People were saying things like, ""Was that as bad as I thought it was?"" and ""J-Lo should have been in this one."" That pretty much says it all."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"This movie is terrible! It contains nothing but sex scenes, sex talk, and a few murders going on in the background. Don't waste your money."
1,"Beautiful Meg, Horrible movie.","This is an example of a less than mediocre detective's movie. The characters are phony, the dialogues false, come on, an english teacher does not speak like that, and her would be lover wouldn't speak like that either. Neverteless Meg Ryan's character is a visual attraction in this movie. Terrible plot and terrible direction."
1,What a Freaking Bore!,The title says it all. Don't bother watching unless you enjoy being bored to death.
1,Porn with A list Actors,"Horrible piece of crap all around. The story and acting were both awful. This was merely a soft core porno with a-list actors that should have never been made.In fact, I enjoyed ""House of the Dead"", ""Swimming Pool"", ""Feardot.com"" and ""Gigli"" more than this movie. Now, that is bad."
1,The worst movie I've seen in years,"Fortunately, I saw this movie on DVD so I could fast-forward through the worst scenes.The movie has awful characters. Meg Ryan plays the part of a women desperate for sex. The detectives are foul-mouthed. The only likeable character is a black English student. Yet later into the film he tries to commit rape.Why would anyone pay money to produce such trash? And why would Meg Ryan agree to play a main character that no one will like?"
2,Mark Ruffalo's Performance Cannot Save This Film,"This film is shot wonderfully, has some real good music and features a fine performance from Mark Ruffalo. But, it is way too weird - the unrated version is way out there for a mainstream film.Meg Ryan, trying to break out of her nice girl image, is Frannie who cries throughout half the movie. She is a teacher who wants to sleep with a student, but does not seem to sleep with anyone until Ruffalo's Detective Malloy asks her questions about a gruesome murder.Frannie suspects Malloy, but Kevin Bacon's John Graham is a weird freak who she should also suspect.I am not sure what Jane Campion was trying to accomplish here, but it quite a tangled, sexual web that she weaves. Also, the flashbacks to Frannie's father ice skating do not make any sense to me."
1,Meg Ryan: PORN STAR,"I used to like Meg Ryan and looked forward to her movies. No longer. This movie was one of the WORST I have ever seen. Meg Ryan has lowered herself to the typical Hollywood sicko depths. Besides her X-rated performance, the director has no clue. After the movie I was left saying - What Was the Point??? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,If a man had directed this there would have been protests,"Jane Campion -- I loved you and you betrayed me! Seriously, I can take my share of grizzly violent scenes in the context of a good film, but this sultry-slasher-wannabe fell totally flat for me. The series of gruesome sex crimes felt degrading and exploitative without even creating that much suspense. Meg Ryan wasn't bad in the film and I don't blame her; I just couldn't relate to the fact that her sexually frustrated character kept making stupid choices. Note to Jane Campion -- you can do better -- go on a retreat and meditate on what you can contribute to the world of film!"
1,in the cut,"I think this picture really damaged the reputation of a lovelylady / Meg Ryan. How could she take part in this absolutely faul movie with so much unnecessary filthy language.The script was the usual bad cop / assistance too the good cop,which has been made God knows how many time.To see Meg naked !!how could she ?? what a damage to this lovely lady of You've gotmail, , Kate & .. , etc ..how did she see the tatoo on the cop's hand in that dark basement , of this filthy bar ?? For me Meg lost it all.bad story so much unneccary bad , bad language. What do we seenext Julia Roberts in the new version of ""Deep Throat""??"
1,worst movie this year (2004),This is yet the worst movie of this year. I thought that as the years advance Hollywood would push to make more intelligent movies? What happened? Are we regressing? Call me at 156-38-3461.
