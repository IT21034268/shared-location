5,Great stuff,"I have 2 buldging disks and a few ither joint problems bettween my left arm and my legs. This stuff doesn't make anything quit hurting but it does allow you to maintain your flexibility. So if your like me and could careless about if your hurt as long as you can get the job done this stuff helps.If you just start using it, it can take a while to start helping, me personaly it took almost a month before I started getting results. It may not be instant but it's worth the time."
2,Kind of dissapointing.,"This books seems rushed. Rushed probably to coincide with WWE's rebirth of ECW. It reads like a transcript of last years DVD of the same name, thrown in are full results from all the supercards from 1993 til closing. That's all. There's really nothing new written for the book. The ""Hardcore History"" book that came out a few months ago reads so much better. It really captures the ""outlaw"" history of the organization, with lots of stories I hadn't heard before. There were a few errors in the book, (probably edited by a non-wrestling fan) and even captions of pictures are mis labled... ""Sabu"" looks a lot like Eddie Gilbert!?!If you've seen the DVD, don't waste your time with this re-hash. If you really want to know about the product ECW, get the other book. Really dissapointing because WWE has really put out some great autobiographys and ""legends"" DVD's. Compared to their prior products, this really sucks."
4,stnadard joseph lai/godfrey ho hack job,"NOTE: won't play on my 2010 imac, will play on my xbox. i'm guessing this has to do with the region-free aspect of the video. not sure how our windows loving friends will fare. took off a single star for this for compatibility reasons.as far as the movie, it's comically awesome... as is almost every other movie these two guys put out... enjoy!"
3,SOME GOOD COVER VERSIONS - BUT BEWARE!,"I Bought this CD primarily for Co.Ro.'s ""Beacause the Night"". I also wanted to hear Sonia's ""Bette Davis Eyes"" (which is good but she tries too hard to sound like Kim Carnes - doesn't quite pull it off) and Jackie Moore in a different song than her early stuff. Although there are some good cover versions my two BIG complaints are that the songs are mixed into each other and several of the songs are at a different volume from others."
4,Liked it.,Decided to install this product after my plumber wanted nearly a thousand dollars to install it THis is not a project for the novice.Took me 2 days but I was happy with the results. Works great so far.
1,Buy something else,"I installed this on the return side because I had very little room on the supply side. Install was simple. I did not buy the install kit. I wired it directly to my furnace. Everything worked fine, except there was zero change in humidity. Air was moving, pad was wet, the unit was draining. But no change in humidity at all after 3 days. Will be sending this back, and installing a steam unit."
1,Flow thru humidifiers an environmentalk atrocity,"Flow thru humidifiers are an environmental atrocity. Mine wastes between one and four litres of HOT water per hour. So I calculate that since the beginning of the heating season my humidifer has sent at the very least 2000 litres of hot water (and perhaps much more) down my drain. So much for the energy saving of my new high efficiency furnace!And furthermore, this humidifier does a truly lousy job of humidifying my house, whose humidity level is now at 20%, and it is not even that cold outside, causing us to feel dry, wasting further energy in heating costs, and damaging my valuable musical instruments. With my previous drum humidifier I was able to keep the house at or close to 50%."
1,cyallanoid was bad,Had to buy a new part for product. It arrived broken and didn't find out until we had it installed. It cost us another fifty to get part but it was cheaper than Uninstalling at paying to ship it back. The cyllanoid was bad.
4,Townes Van Zandt doing his favorite cover songs,"Townes Van Zandt is one of the greatest songwriters to come out of Texas. This album doesn't even have one of his songs on it and it's still one of my favorite TVZ albums. Strange, but true.Here are some of the artists he covers on Roadsongs: Mick Jagger/Keith Richards, Lightnin' Hopkins, Joe Ely, Bruce Springsteen, A. P. Carter, Bob Dylan and others. This is a great album and as the name suggests great driving music.For those who care. The version of Dead Flowers that Townes covers on this album also shows up on The Big Lebowski soundtrack as well as the movie (It's the song that plays after The Dude and Walter scatter Donnie's ashes)."
5,Vey comfortable,"I had a pair of Clark's muckers a few years ago that were absolutely wonderful. i finally had to stop wearing them as the souls wore down but they remained waterproof. I was a bit disappointed that they don't come in wide sizes but found that by ordering the next size up, (I wear an 11W, I ordered a 12M) they fit just fine and are very comfortable..."
5,"Great, Great, Great!",I love my Ice Mucker's! They are so comfy. I've already had them out on really wet grass and my tootsies stayed nice and dry. I've also taken several hikes with my dogs and they do great on dirt trails too. I live in So Cal so I thought that they might get too hot. When the weather is under 95 they are perfect. Over 95 degrees and my feet always get too hot. I'm going to get another pair!
3,"Comfortable, but did not hold up","I loved my Clarks brown Muckers and I wore them a lot. But, I rather expected them to last longer than they did. I had them for less than two years before I noticed that the heels were worn down to a sponge insert. I took them to a shoe repair shop and I was told that they could not be repaired. Now I have to decide whether or not to purchase another pair."
2,Clarks Shoes,I wish I had tried them on in a store first. The size 8 is too large and I have a feeling the 7 1/2 would be too small. Other Clarks in Size 8 have fit well.
4,good waterproof shoes,very roomy and comfortable. love that they zip.only problem is they are a little big in the heel for me.
5,comfortable and new,"This is a very comfortable show.It keeps my feet wet and warm.I have a pair i bought ten years ago, and they are still going strong."
4,Ice shoes,"I recently purchased the shoes to get me through the rest of the winter, since my old clarks were falling apart. Waited until they went on sale. They have done a very good job of keeping my feet dry, but not as warm as I would like them to be. Terrific on ice and snow. Great traction. Light weight and comfortable. Great for running the dog out. I ordered a 9 and they fit great. I would buy again."
1,not a dog toy,This object looks good on a shelf. Just don't let your dog near it. Lasted less than ten minutes before the stuffing was out and the ball was riped to shreds. I have an eighten pound terrier not a wild animal!!! Save your money!!!
1,Ethical Fleece Ball,"I just received this product 10 minutes ago. Opened up-gave to my doxi and the squeeker is already dead. Come on-these products have been getting less and less reliable over the last few years. I will not purchase this product again. For example I still have one that is 4 years old, rather flat and dirty however the squeeker still does - if pressed properly work. Also in the time it took me to come in to my office room and type the first few sentences-I went back to look and guess what-in 15 minutes the product was disembowled and the squeeker stuck in my dogs teeth-he couldnt get off and what if I was not at home. Never again. Used to be a good reliable product. Not now. I am sad about this as my dog loves these balls but what is the point if they last 10 minutes and then become harmful."
2,Disappointing toy,"This squeaking toy arrived with the squeaker not working. My dog still enjoyed playing with the ball, but she tore it and removed stuffing very quickly. Wasn't a good value."
3,Beautiful Cards,"These cards are special. Amazing how they seem to capture exactly where you are at, and what is the key message for the day every time. A real special rare experience. Highly recommended."
4,"works good, could be improved","Works great. However, I'd like it if the cups were a little bigger than the intended size and then had a second line inscribed. This would make them quite a bit easier for prep-ing liquids that will sit for a bit until they go in the pot."
4,This is not the soundtrack to the Underdog Movie,"The keywords associated with this product might make you think it's the soundtrack to Underdog, the 2007 movie.UnderdogIt is not, it's the soundtrack to a different show, read the product description."
5,Shivers down the spine...,I have read other books by Joyce L. Rapier and read them out loud to the family but Whisper My Name is a book to read while hidden away by yourself...There are ghosts and graphically described adult scenes and murders and mayhem and earthy gritty language that makes ya blush...so get under the covers and prepare yourself for some down and dirty good reading.Good job Joycey!
1,Not very good.,"This outdated text should be put to pasture. When was this thing written, 1995? In computer terms it may as well been written in Latin. Thanks for describing Win95 and all about 10base2 thin for us. Very helpful. The most recent ""edition"" was to inform us that our latest threat comes from ""terrorism."" Nice. If you want to know the history of network computing, buy another book. If you want to config your NT 4.0 network, buy another book. In short, buy another book."
2,"Decent book but extremely technical, not for a beginner.","This book would be good for someone who has been into networking for a long time, but I am only a student. It is very well written, but very difficult to understand. It is extremely technical and assumes a lot of previous knowledge, which students don't have. I know I shouldn't blame the writer for that because I'm sure for someone with more expertise, this would be an excellent book. I gave it two stars because I had a very hard time understanding it and most of it was way over my head. I'm just glad I got it inexpensively at Amazon rather than pay full price with the school. Whew. I hardly used it at all for my assignments. But again, I'm sure for someone with a good solid networking background, it would be a very nice reference book."
1,Not Recommended,I bought this book for a class in Network Management. The content in this book is very basic and does not provide much useful information. I do not recommend this book.
2,"A ""C-"" at best","As a history of the A-2 and G-1 jackets, this book falls well short. The authors present a weak history of these sought-after jackets that is frequently interrupted by rather dull accounts by former members of the military reminisincing about their personal jackets. Not enough attention is paid to the 20+ wartime manufacturers and the different contracts for the A-2' jacket . In addition, the authors make several technical mistakes in identifying certain models of jackets, such as the A-1 that the author frequently calls a ""pre A2"" or not mentioning the first version of the G-1 called the M442 or misidentifying a D-1.The authors are also well out of date with the current companies manufacturing high end reproductions. If one is interested in these jackets and their history, they would be better severed by starting with the Eastman catalog and Internet sites of History Preservation Association, Lost Worlds, and Aero Leather Clothing."
5,trekking boots,"These are the best cycling boots i have ever owned! these are my FIRST cold weather cycling shoe. These are awesome as far as i am concerned... they are comfortable! sleek! and they keep my feet warm without making them sweaty! the zipper over the laces make a great vent. 0 complaints about these... i thought they were kinda pricey... But they were worth every penny! they shine nicely and clean up pretty good too! Stiff but not too much so, walking is quite comfortable."
2,"Redundant and Rambling...""You just said that!""",I found most of the content to be redundant and rambling. Very hard to focus on the message when he tells a story like my mother....on and on and on....... Points buddy...get to the points. This book should have only taken 40 pages to say what he need to...this was the longest 118 pages I have ever read! Not entirely about systems nor details on the best way to physically lay them out for purposes of selling the business.
1,Nothing new here,This book presents no new ideas. All of Brad Sugars' books are based on ideas that are stolen from other people and packaged in a uniform fashion. This book is simply a rehash of better written books such as The E-Myth Revisited. Don't waste your time.
1,Don't waste your money on this pointless collection of bromides.,"I don't often abandon a book before finishing, but this mind-numbing collection of useless information was too much to expect anyone to read. Let me share a few tidbits:""Know how much you're spending so you can look for ways to improve and systemize.""""There are many excellent computer systems available that run everything from invoicing to bank account balances. Use them. They will save you time and money.""""Stress is a fact of modern life, and so is competition.""This book reads as if the author read three business books, jotted down the key ideas on individual index cards, then arranged the cards into the outline for this book. An author who has applied these ideas would do more than simply list them - especially those which appear to contradict each other.Save your money, and use it to buy a better business book."
1,"Poorly Written ""Ad Book""","This book read like a student trying to turn a 2 page essay into 12 pages... Redundant, rambling, and filled with ""filler."" Then the entire last few sections of the book are basically an extended advertisement for the author's coaching services. This book was tacky and a waste of time, I recommend looking elsewhere."
5,Instant Systems,"Excellent book. A must for any Business which wants to improve their efficency and effectiveness. Systems are simple, but need to put into place. Once you have a system in place, you dont need to rely such much on the employee. The sytsem runs the Business. Systems can then be easily updated and improved. REad the book and improve your systems which will in turn improve your Business."
3,Meh.,"I use this paper to print handouts for photography workshops that I teach. It doesn't hold shadow detail very well, which is surprising for a glossy paper. I wouldn't recommend using it for images that you really care about.Snapshots for the fridge or something to mail to the family? This is perfect."
1,WORSE PRODUCT EVER,This product is not what it claims to be... High Gloss is NOT what you get... I basically got a HIGH priced pack of computer paper... and really it wasn't even good computer paper. This in NOT Photo Paper
1,Not up to Canon standards...,"This particular paper was not up to Canon's usual standards.. I've never seen the 4x6 papers packaged in this manner either.. I suspect this paper was old, or other paper packaged in Canon box. The seller was less than honest as well, charging $21.96 for a 1 lb. 2oz. package.. Wouldn't purchase this again."
4,"Inexpensive, high-quality paper for home photo printing","This paper works very well for my photo printing needs. I've used it with myCanon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One Photo Printer, and I'm very happy with it. It's not quite as glossy as theCanon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II 8.5in x 11, but it works quite well for what I need.One thing I really appreciate about this paper is that while one side is glossy, the other is basically like card stock, so you can write notes on the back of photos, or you can fold your photos to use them as cards. This is good quality paper, for a very good price. I'm very happy with this style paper, and bought it in this, the 8.5 x 11, and in the 4 x 6 sizes. As far as I'm concerned this is all I think I'll ever need. It covers all of my home photo printing needs."
5,Good photo paper,"This is a reasonably priced product that produces very good photos. I am happy with it, and it's a lot less expensive than buying smaller packs. I found that Canon photo papers work best with Canon printers, so I don't buy other brands anymore."
3,Very thin,"I agree with Carol. It is the thinest (is that a word?) glossy papaer I've every used or seen for that matter. If you plan to use it as a card... forget it. The only positive thing I can think of is its use for lamination. I laminate glossy papper for covers on technical manuals. The this paper make the cover less bulky feeling. I guess its OK but I won't buy it again. Oh yes, if your printer is having trouble feeding heavy photo paper you may want to try this."
5,Only paper that works on my Canon MP970,Printing of color photos may be not be possible on different manufacturer's papers. The Canon paper works just fine in my Canon MP970 photo printer.
5,Awesome Single weight paper,"This paper surprised me a bit, but i love it. Back in the days of film you could buy double or single weight glossy paper. This was before the days of resin coated paper. I used to love the look and feel of single weight glossy kodabrome. This awesome new paper from canon really reminds me of that. I like it for industrial photography styles and even for text and photo combined pages. It's also great for graphics and maps. The greatest part about it is it's cheap enough and good enough for real proofs. Love it."
2,cannon glossy paper,"I will not buy this paper again. Photo quality is not great, even with the best print settings. Will purchase Cannon Glossy Photopaper II which is what came (samples) with my cannon printer. The difference in quality between the two papers is amazing."
4,Great & cheap,I bought this item because I had just spent $15 at the local department store for about 20 pictures and knew that it had to be a cheaper way. I purchased this and was about to print all the pictures from my sister wedding for less than $10. I had taken over 200 pictures and it was worth the money. Thank goodness I have a canon printer and the pictures are as good as the local department kisok has but not as good as actually odering it. So for the price and for time that it saved me. I will definitly buy it again and now I have no problem with the children trying to print random pictures nor pictures that they always need for school.
3,canon photo paper,Cannon Photo paper is it's usual high quality - this one is 170mg - so possibly a little too thin.
5,Beautiful prints,"I can print really beautiful glossy photos on this paper.It is not thin. I think the thickness is the same as regular photo paper from e.g. CVS. It is fine if you will put it in frame, on a wall or into an album."
4,Nice photo paper,I'm a scrapbooker so I print a lot of photos. I buy this paper over and over again because I love the quality. It's glossy and the paper is relatively thick compared to some other brands of paper I've tried. I do also use a Canon printer and my photos come out really nice with this paper.
2,"Good, but Won't Last","I owned this heater for a year and used it regularly. It worked very well until recently. Maybe that's its normal lifespan, but I'm not a fan of planned obsolescence. Now it just blows lukewarm."
3,"Ok, not great","I really like A3 and have several of their CDs. This, however, isn't their best effort. Very middle of the road."
1,Pass on this one,"I didn't even finish this book because I got so sick of the apologies and the ""but I do like children"" stuff.Hey, it's ok to not want to have anything to do with children. Why should anyone feel the need to apologize for not liking them or not wanting to be around them? If you were looking for a book to validate your more hardcore childfree views, this book isn't the one that you were looking for!"
2,Misses the mark,"It seems that Miss Brady laments the fact that she's single a lot more than the fact that she's not having children. Although it is VERY sad for her that the opportunity never arose to marry and procreate, it was quite tedious to read paragraph after paragraph of self-pity. Only after she reached menopause age did she make peace with her childlessness. As someone who is childfree by choice, I purchased this book hoping it would somehow ""affirm my womanhood."" It didn't. Unfortunately, Miss Brady narrowly speaks to single women without children, which of course, is her experience. Those who are unable to have children or have chosen not to would do better reading something more specifically targeted to their situations."
1,Perfidy,It is very badly written and does not attract the reader. The author keeps interjecting with his own subjective views which makes reading difficult.
1,"Should be labeled ""FICTION""","Its another fictitious account Hecht later alluded to in interviews (would never come out and admit the story is 90% fabrication) but smirked and avoided the question when asked directly. Once said of the events ""some things are true but never happened"". Call it WWF on paper.Hecht was a screenwriter (and wrote STORIES for a living) - someone just took one of his ""works"" a little too serious and ran with it as facts. Anything to further the victimization of one group and keep the rest in some sort of indentured servitude to them. Its been overplayed and is getting old....time for a new storyline.After painfully wading through this garbage, I tossed it in the recycling bin. Would take alot to make it into even a bad movie."
2,Meh.,"Approximate size of the thing is from the Z to the M key on a standard keyboard and just about as wide as half a key (this is what you get when people don't keep tape measures by the computer.) SW: KotOR's name is written on the blue blade and has various trademark/copywrite info engraved on either side of the hilt. Nothing special to hold it up or sit it up. It might look good with some taller figures (12"" dolls or the such) or placed on small hooks. Otherwise, not even a good lil toy. With the current price and free shipping, it's technically free compared to the $45 the game itself costs in normal stores."
3,Neetoe-freetoe(as we used to say in school),"It's just a silly prop(I'm not buying it just saying.) It could be played with, if your drunk, high(be carefull with that!), or just plain silly like me. It's mainly a novelty used to put the KotOR into perspective(well, scale perspective). Oh, and I think it probably stinks, most plastic toys out today do. Some kind of safety thing I guess."
5,Best RPG ever..period!!!!,"The people at Lucas Art have outdone themselves!!! In short this is without a doubt the best RPG game ever. I must admit when starting the game it was a bit complicated to figure everything out, but by the first hour you'll get it all down. If you want to buy a Star Wars game this is the one. It may however spoil you its that good. I can't wait till the next game from this company comes out!! Its a bummer when the game ends, you just want it to go on forever."
4,Texas country-folk's main attraction delivers live,"Imagine John Wayne with a guitar ... conveying toughness, pride, humor, and above all, integrity without having to raise his voice and rarely changing the pace of his words. That is the kind of talent and charisma Guy Clark possesses. His guitar playing is wonderfully intricate and his lyrics rank with anyone else's best. Slices of life like ""Texas 1947"" and ""Desperados Waiting For A Train"" perfectly convey the feel of those little Texas towns a few miles south or north of any main highway."
5,Great oil for Harley's,"You can use this oil in for the engine oil, primary, and transmission in Harley's. My Streetglide seems to run cooler using this full synthetic compared to the dyno oils. With Mobil 1 you cant go wrong. It is a high quality oil and a good price. A lot cheaper than royal purple."
5,Harley must have.,Best price for this item anywhere. A must have for your bike if you do your own work. Will purchase again in a few months.
4,The only oil I'll put in my bike,"After switching to Mobil 1 in my 2009 Sportster, I'm sold. Oil temps dropped immediately and noticeably. The engine starts faster, runs smoother. I'm sold."
5,Truely Amazing Product.,"I had been using an Amsoil 10-40 synthetic in V-Star 1100 and it seemed OK, but the gear changes weren't the best. When I had the bike in for service, they changed the oil and when I got it back, the clutch felt like it was slipping and the engine was noisier then usual. I'm assuming they put a convectional Yamalube oil. So I used this Mobil-1 20-50 VTwin oil. OMG! I never thought oil would make such a noticeable difference, but it was instant. The bike ran cooler, quieter and the shifts were crisp and smooth. The 50 weight looks like molasses coming out, but works great in a v-twin. Highly recommend."
5,Best By Far!,"I have been riding for 38 years. I know bikes and I've tried all the oils. Mobile 1 V-Twin 20w-50 makes my 2008 Softail Custom run smoother, quieter, and 15 degrees cooler than the Harley oil that came in the bike new. I change it every 5000 miles and it looks nearly as clean coming out as it did going in. It doesn't blacken or break down in the 100+ degree Texas heat with me riding it like I stole it! It's worth every penny and then some!!!"
5,The life and times of our 35th president,"A look at the life and times of our 35th president, the Kennedy clan and the mystique of Camelot. Follow his trip to the White House, his marriage to Jacqueline, and the 1,000 days of wonder that were the Kennedy Presidency. Volume 1: The Man Who Would Be President, 1917-1956 Volume 2: The Race for the White House, 1957-1961 Volume 3: The Presidency and the Legacy, 1961-1963"
5,The Best- bar none,"Mary Jane Lammond has once again produced a truly unique and exquisite recording of traditional Gaelic songs. Regardless of what your musical taste are you will enjoy this CD. I highly recommend her first CD also. To those of you who are new to Mary Jane Lammond you should know that she sings exclusivly in Gaelic.You do not (!), by any stretch of your immagination,need to understand Gaelic in order to appreciate Mary Jane Lammond anymore than you need to understand French to appreciate Edith Piaf. Listen to the samples of this recording only if you are prepared to buy."
5,A superb album by a superb artist,"Although I unfortunately have not yet heard her very first album, ""Land of the Trees"" (or yet heard her 4th and newest album, ""Gaelic Songs"" which is currently only available through a Canadian label), this is undoubtedly a brilliant album by a talented singer--there is an excellent balance of traditional and contemporary, as with Suas E!, and every one of the songs sticks in your head after only one or two listens... already I can sing most of 'A Mhairi Bhoidheach' from memory, and I don't know Scots Gaelic! It's one of those albums that sticks with you; that you'll listen to over and over again. And the fact that while she is not only a talented singer, but also helps bring attention to the Scots Gaelic language and the Cape Breton culture, only serves to make her music more meaningful. Listen to this album, if you haven't already!"
5,Brilliant,"Brilliant! Mary Jane is brilliant! Her voice rings true on her recordings and as you sit across from her in a workshop! She brings all listeners to the Gaelic tradition (even my moody middle school students love her)! Oh and to ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" reviewer from 2000, have you listened to her traditional Gaelic Cd of songs from Nova Scotia? Did you? Hmmmm?"
3,RAW REVOLUTION,"Sugar Free and using Agave Nectar, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Soy Free are very important to us. However, we did not like the flavor very well."
1,Usually like these...not the last box though,"The last box of these bars tasted ""off"" I wasn't sure why at first, but about half of the bars in the box were not sealed in their wrappers. They may have simply been rancid."
1,Is all raw food this gross?,"The best thing I can say about these bars is that they are less disgusting then the Chocolate and Coconut bars. But, they are still pretty disgusting. If you are not a raw food fan, these are not the food bars you are looking for."
2,Acquired taste,"The taste is NOT what you would expect. I have had better tasting products. For it to be a heavy, chocolate tasting bar, it tasted more like the agave nectar than the chocolate. Very disappointed."
5,Great meal replacement/ treat!,"I absolutely love these bars! They are a great meal replacement - they taste great, fill me up, and keep me satiated. I wish there wasn't so much fat in them, but it's ok because of all the high-quality ingredients. Love the 100-calorie snack-sized version too! All the flavors are great, but the Chocolate Cashew is my favorite...."
5,Great!,"These bars are really good as a snack on-the-go or even as a sweet treat after meals. I've just recently started diving into the organic and health food market, and so far I'm impressed. At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like these bars - organic is one thing, but ""raw"" seemed like another. I've been used to that certain taste of sugar and additives that usally go along with snack bars like these, and thought for sure the difference was going to be a lot bigger. Certainly, it tastes a bit different, but it's a different, REAL* food taste that I can get used to. These bars have the necessary sweetness that cover up the fact that these things are actually kind of good for you. From one junk food lover to another, these things are great!"
1,"I could do a better ""one finger"" than Swizz","With the exception of a track by Primo and another by Timbaland, this album is produced exclusively by Swizz. And I got to tell 'ya, I could do a better ""one finger"" beat than he does. Most tracks sound like a 7 year old playing around on a drum machine and then looping 4 bars of it. If you're looking for simplistic beats, this (and anything from Cash Money) will provide lots of them. If you've grown up a little and want some depth and artistic flavor in your ear, skip this.Now as far as rhymes on the album... not terrible, not great. The hooks are uninspiring, very annoying, and provide little depth to the lyrics. Most tracks have (what I call) a ""group yell"" hook. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about if you've heard 'Wild Out'."
2,"LOX ARE GARBAGE,EVEN WIT RUFF RYDERS","Even though the Lox are back with the Ruff Ryders camp, they still sound mad similar to when they were on Bad Boy. The only tru banger on this album is the DJ Premier produced ""Recognize."" Other than dat, this album ain't worth two cents. there are much better albums than this junk for everyone to buy."
3,Its Aiight!,"Dat new LOX is tight. Its a couple of tracks on there. Its bout' on the same level as 'money, power, respect'. They come out hard and real as hell on dis album. You have to be a LOX fan to appreciate it."
1,Wack&wack belong together,The Lox were wack with Puffy and now they are wack with Ruff Ryders.both are Lame.Puffy&his Bad Boy crew Recycle any and everything.Ruff Ryders&Swizz beatz are Lame.every alum release by them all sound the same.the raps are wack&the music sounds like a Poor mans Casio.the only cut that works comes from a outside Producer Ryde or dye by Timberland.who is very overrated.yes he has beats but what else? don't be surprised when Ruff Ryders play out that you see The Lox going to Cash Money or whoever is hot.
5,best rap group album of the year right now,"lox new album we are the streets is off the hook because every song was banging on the album and just kill the lyrics over the beats produced by timbaland, premier and p killer while the guest lace the joints and lyrics on the album while the hook on album was blazing hook and i am true lox fan and this album will tell you that the real lox killing the industry right now and this album is going to sell more than double platium for real"
3,"Please, Work Harder","First off, this CD has awesome beats, but the lyrics make you wanna concentrate on the music, all throughout the CD. The first single ""Wild Out"" is tight, but the lyrics are not good. Other songs on the CD are ok, but this is better than their last CD. I would buy this if you have 15 or 18 bucks that you want to buy a decent CD."
5,The Lox is HOT!!!,"I don't care what anyone says, The Lox are one of the best trios in the rap game today. Every single one of them, whether it be Shiek, Styles or Kiss, bring the heat on every verse on every track, and with Swizz Beatz on the production side of things, you got one dope album!!! If you ask me, Shiek, Kiss and Styles are the best in the Ruff Ryders clique. What sets them apart from other rap groups is that they all have their own unique styles (no pun intended). Each of them come hard and it just seems like they all put a lot of effort into this album, and it pays off because you don't have to skip tracks because every track is tight. The beats on this album are also some of the tightest around. Don't listen to other people who diss The Lox just because of their previous relations with Puffy. Go buy this album today if you already don't have it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed..."
5,This cd is goin off!,"This cd is hot, By listening to blood pressure, you can tell why jada kiss is going solo.This cd i a big, monster step impromevment over their last one.With money power respect being the only good track on their last album, fans of lox will definately notice a change when they here this stuff if you like gangsta rap, check this out."
3,O.K.,"These guys hollard about getting off Bad Boy and they spit this mediocore album. I expected a lot more hearing how Puffy orcastrated the Lox's style and they finally getting off the label. The album drags after the ""Wild Out"". The album starts to sound redundant."
5,Wow!,"I heard this album was good, but wow. The Lox keeps it real. They didn't go commerical on this album, this is straight street. With these three how could go wrong. Best songs are2. F*ck You5. Breathe Easy6. Felony Niggas7. Wild Out8. Blood Pressure (Jadakiss Solo)9. Recognize11. Y'all F*cked Up Now12. Scream L.O.X.15. Ryde or Die, B*tch (produced by Timbaland)18. We Are The Streets"
3,it would be a five star joint if it wasn't for swiss,swiss is garbage and the sooner them catz at ruff ryders figure that out the better off they will be cause i ain't felling that cat.word is bond he really needs to get his casio playing a** on. get a roland and come better. but as far as my guys the lox go they are untouchable. yo you catz keep ruff ryding and soon puff will be asking you for a job. and yo them premiere and timbaland tracks japped out take notes swiss.stay up one
3,Puff or no Puff they are still the same old LOX,"Ok, woo hoo... they left Bad Boy. But these guys had already sold there soul before there 1st CD. (doesn't this usually happen on the 2nd CD) It's some banging tracks, some wack tracks, and some aight' tracks. Ruff Ryders are not going to make these guys superstars like they're hoping to be. Radio might give them air play, but the underground scene doesn't respect them. I'm not ""hating"" on the guys, but i thought they were hot in the underground scene and on mix tape. But Bad Boy put them in shinny suits and now they're street thugs? come on ! Help me out, was it not a cool idea to be called a thug back in the day, but its the thing to be in 2k. This is one of those CD's that I probaly want pick back up until I hear a song on radio or video.ONE...."
2,It's a shame,"I was very disapointed with this CD, the singing is fine but the music sounds like it comes out of a loop box.It is very hard to tell how much is real insrument or computer generated.And when I tried to put it on my computerit would not let unless I installed some software.I think I am throwning it out.I think John Tiven could do a better job with this singer.I hope to hear a better sounding CD from her.OLf Veldhuis"
5,Butch Hancock is the Bob Dylan of Texas,"Butch Hancock is the Bob Dylan of Texas. There is nothing better than Butch live. And recordings of Butch live never quite match the live experience. But this (non-live) album tops all recorded events to date. Unquestionably the best version of ""If You Were a Bluebird"" I've heard."
5,Tremendous value,"All the Delphi releases are great value and good quality, but this one stands out, bringing some truly great past translations all in one place."
5,Now I see,This book changed my world view. I had grown up on the evangical end times philosophy never questioning what was going on in the Middle East. After reading this I have seriously studied current Middle Eastern politics and end times philosophy's from a more enlightened perspective. Thank you for this wonderful book!
2,major let-down,"a very disappointing album, faceless & uninspired, featuring bland, tired songs & appropriately dull interpretations (no wonder since diana & marv recorded the vocals separately); nobody involved seemed interested, least of all the two stars; the only two redeeming songs are 'you are everything' & 'stopl, look, listen', released as singles in britain, but curiously not in the states, where three other songs were, 'my mistake', 'you're a special part of me' & 'don't knock my love', none of which was a hit; another curiosity is that this album was a huge seller in britain, probably thanks to ross' immense popularity there in the early 70s; still, it's a really bad collection of songs, with arrangements so unimaginative it is unbelievable"
1,I'm sorry but Diana can not sing ( she screaches),I'm sorry but Diana can not sing ( she screaches). Give me a break she is such a joke in everything she does. And the only reason why she made it this far was simply because of one man Berry Gordy. Please give me a break people.
1,DIRTY GAME!,I ordered this game and it came relitively quickly. When i recieved the game it was terribly dirty. There was sticky brown gunk all over the game and the connection was dirty and took a while to clean. VERY UNSATISFIED
5,Broad yet still practical,"HYDROLOGY, by Serrano covers a wide variety of problems in groundwater hydrology and enviornmental contaminants. The book takes the massive amounts of information available on the subject and puts it in a usable, learnable form. The homework problems are well designed to inforce real world application."
3,"if you don't like it, don't listen","Yes, I liked BCR in the 70's, and still enjoy hearing certain feel-good songs again. If you liked BCR back when, or want to hear something fun, give it a shot, Rock and Roll Love Letter, Saturday Night or whatever. But if you don't own the album, or simply want to show how cool you are by saying you couldn't possibly listen to this, then please, don't listen. If you have nothing informative to say other than how uncool the music is, save your time and ours. No, it's not Beethoven or Bob Dylan, but it is fun; lighten up."
5,Brings back memories,"I stumbled across this while shopping for something else. Wow! This brings back memories of my ""younger"" days! If you are looking for one cd that will give you most of the popular and memorable songs from the Bay City Rollers then this is the one for you."
5,The best of the 1970s!!,"In the 1970s, only ONE group mattered: the Bay City Rollers! They were an awesome group with lots of staying power, and to this day, they still sell records through the ceiling! If you know what's good for you, you will buy this CD, no questions asked. It's THAT good! Click ""add to cart"" and you're done!"
1,Last reviewer is a HYPOCRITE amigos!,"Toro: Say Pancho didn't the last reviewer hate all 1970s music. Pancho: Si Toro, he is immature. Toro: The Bay City Rollers were ONE-HIT WONDERS not only in America but in Tijuana toos. Pancho: What guys would wear skirts on-stage but these losers. Toro and Pancho say buy a Spanish music record by the Maharichi or risk being called stupido!"
1,What a bunch of dumbkuffs these boy-banders are,The Bay City Rollers are what is played when one goes to meet Satan and you also have to sit next to Brataney Sneers and Justa Stinkercake. Saturday Night was these bozos' only hit. The Baddest Critic is a hypocrite pallies. He does detest all 1970s music. I mean what guys would wear skirts on-stage but these losers. Avoid or HEEGOTCHA!!
3,THE GREATEST HITS CD IS BETTER...,"... for the following reasons:1) despite the CD's claim of being ""remastered"", the sound is muddy - in fact, the ""Greatest Hits"" collection has greater clarity of sound;2) ""Don't Stop The Music"", one of BCR's biggest hits, is not included in this ""Definitive Collection"" - however, it can be found on ""Greatest Hits"";3) there's too much filler here - and the sound quality on the early tracks is REALLY awful.Don't waste your money on this turkey - get the ""Greatest Hits"" collection instead."
3,not as good as i remember,"still had some power in saturday night,money honey and wouldn't you like it as well as the pop hit i only want to be with you but the rest is filler material, not as good as i remember the old days!"
1,Equal opportunity degradation,"Poor Ramona. We all knew PUSH, a decent first novel, would be a hard act to follow and we hoped she could pull it off. Not! These poems glamorize abuse and degrade every group - black, women, homosexual, white, heterosexual - they address. Saddest of all, the ""poet"" degrades - and plays - herself. Big time. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,sapphire does it again - unfortunately,"degrading stereotypes of black folks to make a buck, flat writing, self-promoting ""bad girl"" posturing, all just like the ultra-lame Push novel, yep, she sure does do it again, much to the dismay of most black people I hang with. please, Sapphire, spare us any more of your ""art""."
4,Bought for new Pointer Sisters tracks,"Wow, a Christmas CD that has some new 2007 recordings from R&B legends of the 70's and 80's. Nice package of great singing, arrangements and songs. I bought it for the 2 new songs by the Pointer Sisters - the first studio recordings made since June Pointer passed away, and her niece Issa replaced her. Their version of "" CAROL OF THE BELLS "" is amazing - very spiritual, and highly intricate with the harmonies & layers of vocals. Plus, they do a new song "" CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK "". For that matter, any fan of the big name artists on this CD will want to have this collection for the new and rare songs that are on it."
4,Clarks Etna mucker,"Great shoe. Exactly what I was looking for to take on a trip to the Pacific Northwest. I wore these shoes hiking hiking everday while in the Pacific Rim of Vancouver Island and on Mt. Rainier.The only problems was that I got just days before my trip and didn't have a chance to properly break them in, hence bad blisters. By the end of my trip (11 days)my skin had harden and all was good. Very comfortable for loads of walking and kept me dry."
2,Heavy and big,The shoe runs at least one and half size big than the true size! They are heavy and wide .......way too much! Can not be returned as I wore them outside ......now what now?
2,We were IN the movie!!!,"This is a very critical and negative documentary toward a few people who have gotten boob-jobs. Add to that a boring, ambiguous, history of boobs- loosely tying it in with the stories of the women getting the surgery and there you have it. Unless you are a fan of Julie Strain etc. take a pass on this one..."
5,Highly recommend!,"So this is a documentary, not designed to titillate. That being said, I'm not going to let my teenage boys see it, as there is quite a bit of boob to behold. Anyway, this documentary provides a glimpse of the cultural impact of our boob-obsession. Women featured in the film have used their breasts for profit, for self-esteem boosting, and even for BREAST FEEDING (gasp). Opinions vary about the purpose of breasts, but there is no question they are important in our culture. So I I highly recommend this film for a thought provoking (and yes, titillating at times) reflection on the cultural influence of breasts."
3,Interesting documentary,"This is a documentary about the role of breasts in American culture and is focused on women who decide to have implants or breast reduction (or removal for health reasons). For me, it was perhaps rather superficial in terms of both female and male psychology. There are interviews with women who decide to have this plastic surgery and their male partners also give opinions. We also see the surgery in progress and the end results. The term 'Hollywood Perfect' is used to describe the ultimate breast and that is perhaps a clue to the American Dream theme that powers this huge industry in the US. I would rate the documentary as three stars and perhaps worth a viewing. Ideal drink for viewing pleasure: of course milk."
1,sooooooooo boring,too long n boring if ur lookin to see boobs just watch porn not worth the money this movie sucks maybe its good 4 women but NOT 4 men
1,Not hot,"Followed directions. It wasn't hot. Maybe a bad batch, I don't know. I do know that it wasn't at all hot."
2,Wasabi?,"I love wasabi, even the horseradish version that is usually passed off. This stuff is so weak, I can not consider it in the same family of either. I added a teaspoon to an 8 ounce can of nuts and had very little effect. I tried another, still with minimum effect.Go with the paste. That stuff kicks tail!Ben"
5,keep you warm,"Light weight, and they keep you warm without sweating. My job requires me to be inside and outside all day long. Thermal bottoms are to warm for me to wear inside, however the silk bottoms don't overheat me inside. Another great feature is they are not bulky like thermals."
3,light weight silk underware,"just as advertised - very light - bought for my son, who has no body fat to give him an extra layer under his ski pants - may not be enough, but we will see. I wear silk as a layer under mine and it works great. can also wear under any pants."
2,bad sizing,the top part of these were huge while the legs were very tight. I very much prefer the REI brand for correct sizing all around. These are silk and yes they are 3x but I would rather spend the same money elsewhere
3,Mine didn't work...,"Ordered this simple antenna jumper for installing a new stereo in my 06 Legacy. Mine doesn't seem to work, plug/wiring just don't seem very tightly connected which is important for an impedence matched antenna. Trying the Scosche version next:-/Update: turns out the adapter was probably fine. Found out there is an antenna amp in my 2006 Legacy, so I had to hook-up the remote antenna power lead from the new stereo to the wiring harness."
5,An Unbeatable Reference Source for Gems and Minerals!,"This oversized ""coffee table"" style book, contains some of the most impressive gem and mineral photography in print. The photos were taken by Erica and Harold Van Pelt who are the most revered gemological photographers in the world. In addition, the text is well organized and flawlessly researched. Gems and Crystals really captures the magic responsible for mankind's obsession with gem minerals. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a passion for gems."
1,the adam and eve SINdrome,"Gutter slop. Roy is a woman hater. Anyone who believes this crap, give me a call. I just cleans to hog house and I gave a 5 gallon bucken of manure I will sell you for the price you paid for this book. You will get more benifit from it than the book."
1,ridiculous,"absolutely ridiculous! advertised with a picture of 5 clubs and a title as juggling clubs (plural) with no description stating how many come in an order. I was very surprised to see i recieved only 1, contacted the seller and they seemed like they could care less. DO NOT BUY."
1,"Talentless, execrable","I remember a time when poems were supposed to be intelligent and well-written and creative. What has happened, that this lazy, self-indulgent, unimaginative writer has received even the lukewarm acclaim that she has?"
5,Classics Never Die,"The whole Genesis NBA gaming setup is cool. Bulls vs. Blazers, Bulls vs. Lakers, and this Lakers vs. Celtics and the NBA Playoffs on the HD TV. Okay, so it's not gonna have the HD graphics, but it's still smooth to experience the gameplay on the big screen. Each player with their own signature move. Wilkins, Bird, Ewing, Miller, Starks, etc... With this particular game you just get the playoffs look of it with certain teams. You'll really want to have the whole collection. No one button spin moves to breeze through the game, just good old school timing."
2,their first cd......,"The truth is I really don't like this cd, although, their lyrics are still great, and thier message is still good. Toby sounds like crap (more like a little kid) in this cd, but he is the one that wrote and produced all of the songs. I liked ""spinning 'round"", but most of the songs just sound so weird! Mike is ok, but not as good as a singer as in later cds. Kevin is a terrific singer. They had to start somewhere, I guess. This is back in the day when they were all rap (like their second and most of their third cds). DC Talk is probably one of my favorite, if not favorite, band. Plus, they only have eight songs on this cd. Only recommended if you're in need of a good message."
5,Best Bible I've ever used.,"It truly helps to have not just notes, but SO MANY notes!! On everything! I used to have a life application Bible that was of minor interest to me. On the contrary, this Bible is something I want to study. I'm going through some of Acts and Galatians, and it makes it so much easier to know not only the underlying meanings, but the background information of where Paul was going and his purposes. So, not even a week yet, this Bible has been great! I would recommend it for any age over 12 probably. My college-aged brother uses it, as well as my high-school aged sister."
5,Help for daily bible study.,The NIV has been a help with my bible study. It is amazing with all of the footnotes at the bottom of the page. These footnotes help apply scripture to our daily lives. I am very thankful to have such a wonderful reference.It also explains the history at the time that the scriptures were written. This bible is easy to understand. Again it is the footnotes that are so helpful. :)
2,Life application study bible niv,"Life Application Study Bible, NIV- I purchased the kindle version of the Life Application Study Bible -NIV because I thought it would have the same options of the book version. Using the search option in the kindle version, ONLY refers me to the cross reference (application notes) instead of the scripture itself. I want the search option to point me to the scripture itself in which I am searching for and not the application notes. I use a different bible application to search for the scripture I want and use the Life application to read the application notes. I want this bible to do both. Also, the Kindle version does not allow you to copy a text as other applications allow. This is the only thing I dislike about this application."
2,Life Application Study Bible,"The footnotes are not on the bottom of the page and it's difficult to navigate around from one book to another. I have this in hardcover aned I love it, but on the Kendle it's set up differently."
5,The best translation I have ever read.,"I have a friend who was not familiar witht he Bible, so I bought this one for her. She is reading it every day and understands much of what she reads. We have a chance to discuss different topics that she has questions about and seems to enjoy it. This translation tells the stories without all of the ""thee's and thou's"". Well written."
1,Pages are too thin - the back side shows through!,"The Life Application is a wonderful commentary Bible. I've bought many for friends and family. However, this printing has pages so thin the ink shows through from the back side. It makes it difficult to read. Pass on this edition!"
4,Good study tool.,First the speed to jump from chapter to chapter. One button to check references.I like the notes also.Very good study tool.
3,Life Applicaron Study Bible,"This Bible is easy for reference purposes in a daily study class. The highlights of various persons in the stories are helpful, and it coordinates well with the study guides I use.My issue with this book is that the print is quite small.I appreciate the condensed versions of the readings also."
3,Life Aplication Study Bible,Liked what I SEEN BUT NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THE SAMPLE TO REALY KNOW WHAT IT WAS GOING TO REVEAL TO ME
3,Print Size,"The print is quite small, and with my every day reading glasses 2.5, I could not read the print. If you are older, you may have a difficult time with this print size."
2,Not as said,"As a premise, I have a BOOKMAN sidekick with an NIV Bible and had been using it for more than 10 years. I can find the verse by typing key words. I consider SEARCH as the most important function but it did not help me search the verse - SEARCH AND FIND or ASK AND RECEIVE or KNOCK DOOR OPEN in Kindle. I just want to be update that is why I tried Kindle, but I can't use successfully the SEARCH function."
5,"for serious study, and for serious questions.","This Bible was one of the best I have ever found. It is completely comprehensive in the layout and the way the foot notes are created. The notes and introductions really pose questions to ask yourself as you are reading, and the historical backgrounds are very significant for those that want to understand the cultural relevances in certain passages. This is an excellent Bible for the serious scholar and also for those who are opening up the word if God for the first time."
5,One of the greatest bibles for understanding.,This bible is the greatest for applying biblical principles to life. It captures the necessary historical views surrounding scripture and provides clear understanding of what the scripture means. I own many bibles but find this one to be the best and easiest to understand.
5,I love this book!!!!!,"I am a new christian and for me sometimes i was always struggling to relate the bible to my everyday life. This book has provided me with detailed explanation on most of the verses from the bible, and now i can use this book for self study anytime rather than just in the bible study group."
2,"Hard Back, No Index","Read the description carefully! I would have preferred the version with an index. Also, this is not the leatherbound edition.The study outline and footnotes are incredibly detailed and informative. Perfect for long term study! Still prefer leatherbound and indexed version!"
1,Wet Book,I received my book in the mail and was very disappointed. The book was inside a package but it was wet. I purchased this book used and I was not expecting it to be this way. I contacted the seller and they were not very helpful in this matter. They tried to accuse me of damaging the book..they asked if I left the book outside. I just picked it up from the PO and why would I leave it outside? They said that they did not package the book wet....did not offer an apology. They asked me to take pics of the book. I decided not too since it was only 14 bucks. I know not to order anything else from this company.
4,Lots of Great Content,"A great study Bible with lots of maps, references, etc. Really nice selection of information. I personally like the layout with the location of the study /reference information. For myself, if I were to change anything I would be getting the large print version, just for convenience."
4,Life Application Study Bible,EVERYTHING Was wonderful. Sorry but I have no other comments. I will not do this again the book is very nice helping me very much with my understanding of life and the Bible.
4,Study Bible,"I was pleased with my purchase, it was bigger then I expected but with large print and a study Bible I guess it needs to be big. I'm loving it."
5,Life Application Study Bible,The Application Study Bible lives up to its name. It greatly facilitates putting the scriptures into one's life (application of the scriptures).
5,Easy to use,Easy to use in the Kindle Fire format. It took a little exploring to find where the textual notes were. Contains a wealth of extra Biblical insight. I had previously downloaded a different version of the Bible that didn't have an index containing links to each book then chapter of the Bible. This version has no guessing random locations to find a specific verse. The only thing I find annoying is when I am paging through and accidentally hit one of the many links on the page and end up with a cross reference. But the back arrow will take me back to where I started.A very good Bible to have on your Kindle. And way less expensive than the print version.
1,study bible,"The problem i have with the study bible is the ease of use,it is non excisting, dificult to even try to go from one book to another i find it totally useles for my intention of use"
3,"Lots of Information, but.....","Bring your magnifying glass - this is printed in very small font. Additionally, the pages are so thin that the print on the opposite side of the page is clearly visible and obscures the page your trying to read. At times, this is very bad and very distracting.Between the font size and obscured print due to the thin pages - this book is TOUGH reading.With that said, I will also say that it is packed with information and is very well organized.You can definitely learn a great deal about the Bible, but it is tough reading due to the aforementioned issues."
2,Bible Study,I have a hard copy of the Bible and enjoy it greatly. I purchased the Kindle addition to take on vacation. I found it very hard to search the Bible for specific Books and Chapters. I did not read it on vacation and will have to research my search procedures in the future. I was sorry that I purchased it.
3,Fair,"I have the hard copy version so I thought the digital version would be just as good. I was wrong. All the study notes found at the bottom of each page in hard copy are omitted from the digital version. I still like the convenience of having the digital version because I travel extensively. However, I do miss the study notes."
5,Perfect for the New Christian,Bought this for a friend who needed a study guide with the bible as he just started to read it. Perfect condition and great service!
4,LIFE APPLICATION BIBLE,"I think the Life Application series of Bibles is the best!The personal size is very small print, so get one of the larger prints if your eyes are not very sharp."
3,Useing it on Kindle,"I'm having trouble learning how to use it on Kindle. My computer knowledge is slim so it makes it hard. My husband has Life Application and really like it.Just got Kindle for Christmas thought would be great to have Bible on Kindle but not as easy as I thought it would be to use.The Bible gets all five stars and more, but putting it on the kindle made it hard for me."
4,Good Bible Study Tool,Good bible study tool Makes it easy to locate scriptures and gives lots of additional sources for further Bible Study. Recommend it for those wanting to go beyond the basic scriptures.
5,Excellent,I have a hard copy at home and use a Kindle version while traveling. both are top notch! Ideal for study.
2,"No ""Address""","The Bible is not an effective tool because , at least on the kindle fire, there are no book, chapter or verse listing at the top of each page only a location number. Also on each page there is not a tab to allow you to go back to the index. If I could retun it, I would."
4,"very very easy to follow, explanations, and references are point on",recommend it for those wanting layman term readingsoft cover easier to carrycan easily apply your life to things referencedonly suggestion or thing I didn't like is the very small font
5,Excellent I love it!,I am extremely happy with my product. It is exactly what I was looking for and I am looking forwrd to making other purchases in the future.
5,NIV Life Application Bible,"I love this Bible but I didn't realize I could get a second hand Large Print which would have been better for age 66 eyes LOL. Is there anyway I could exchange it, as I bought it second hand or give this one to a friend and get another one? Karen McLaughlinIt explains the Lord's words so clear and understandable we use it for our Bible Study every week. I love it!"
4,A great study for the word of GOD,I feel this study bible is very easy to read and it gives me a great understanding of what God is trying to tell me. It breaks down a lot of the meaning of what Jesus is telling us. I find it not as easy as I would like it to be to find my way back to pages when I want to visit other areas it directs me to. Maybe with time I will master it better
4,Life Application Bible,I like my hard back as I can see how it applies in my daily life. Sometimes I have trouble navigating back and forth and find my self having to go to table of contents quite frequently! I do like having a copy on my IPhone and Ipad.
5,Study Bible NIV,Love it! makes my Bible study so much easier and understandable! I use it in Bible study classes and on Sunday mornings during church services.
1,Majesty Christian E-Bookstore is Not Reliable,"I believe many people purchasing through Majesty are not checking to see if they received exactly what they ordered. They depend on this to receive a high star rating. I purchased a leather-bound Bible according to my receipt. I received imitation leather. Majesty insists that they are not responsible to supply what I ordered despite the ""leather-bound"" evidence on my receipt. Not only this, but I had to take time off from work and spend an extra $10 to send the Bible back to them! It is January 18, and my friend still has no Christmas gift and I still have no reimbursement. What a racket!"
5,"If you read the bible without applying it,it is just fiction","This bible was given to me by my wife a number of years ago and has helped me significantly in really understanding what the bible is all about. It is about the most important thing in your life, your relationship with God. What ever you are doing, you can't take it with you (when you leave this world). Other reviewers have recapped it very well. Let me know if you buy one and what you think. Brian Nelson Marketing Business Critic bnelson@onramp.net 713-467-3025. God Bless."
1,If you have the Book - this is no substitute for it,"This version has none of the benefits the book has - well, it may, but they make it impossible or highly awkward to use. You can't just review the comment and stay on the page, you move away and then have to HUNT and I mean HUNT to find the table of contents again and then where you were. I can't use it at church because it has no easy reference to hop from one chapter or book to another - you have to go all the way back to the beginning and start all over again. I have not opened it again and will delete it off my Kindle."
5,Trouble understanding the bible? Here's your answer,"Have you read the bible and at the end of the passage didn't understand what you just read? Then you haven't used the Life application bible. It explains the bible in everyday words/stories. Forget King James, this is the last bible you'll ever use!"
3,Not the best study Bible I've come across,"As a study Bible this is one pretty average. Although there is an overview for each book, there is no breakdown and insight into individual passages readily accessible that I can find. I am disappointed with my purchase. If I could return it I would because it is not what I was lead to believe."
3,bible,It is difficult to navigate in kindle format. I bought it in an attempt to not take my bible with me while traveling. Next time I travel I will take a paper copy of a bible.
1,Life Application Study Bible NIV Large Print,"This book was recommended to me to use in a class. I have another version in smaller print, The larger print version is easier to read for people who need corrective lens. Also, it includes the tools needed to study any topic which include profiles of bible figures, cross references, concordance, and a plan to guide your daily time in the word."
4,understanding the Bible,"Thinking about reading the Bible, I would highly recommend this version which contains more text explaining the often difficult to understand verses than the actual bible text. An excellent guide to give you explanations and insight into often difficult passages"
5,I find it very helpful in my everday walk with God.,I have used the Life Application Bible for at least 8 years and I think is a good bible for both new and old christians. It helps me see the scripture and how I can apply it to my life. It gives a lot of resource information to help when I teach Sunday School or a Bible Study. I recommend it in both the NIV and the KJV.
5,Sunday School Teacher Review,"I recently decided to teach a young adult class at my church. I wanted a good study bible. This bible is excellent. The NIV version is so down to earth. When you can explain things so old and new Christians alike can understand, what a blessing everyone receives. The dictionary in the back is awesome. The charts in the chapters and the description at the beginning of every book of the bible is so detailed. I find it hard to put down when I am studying and I have grown just reading this bible. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants an excellent study bible."
5,Praise God!,"Has a lot of things other study Bibles don't (tables, personality profiles, etc.) and the NIV translation makes the reading so much better."
4,OK,"The study helps are good. The NIV translation is OK. I prefer New Living Translation (2nd edition, published in 2005) than NIV (last updated in 1984). If you can afford it, buy both Life Application Study Bible with New Living Translation (NLT 2nd edition) and NIV Faith in Action Study Bile. The former focuses more on individual verses, while the latter focuses more on the overall message of each chapter and book of the Bible, which most people tend to ignore."
4,Verses hard to find.,"I love having the Life Application Bible on my Kindle. Love the Bible. Wish it had a place to type in the actual verse or passage I am looking for. I have to go to the particular book, then the chapter and flip through the chapter to find the passage I'm looking for. I thought it would be great to take along to my study group, but not so sure with it being difficult to just flip to the passage."
4,"Great content, but too thick","I really like the content and added references in this bible, but it is a VERY THICK book. I wanted a personal sized bible but cannot find a cover for this particular one because it is so thick. The dimensions were given but I didn't think to look. I think it's all the added info and commentary (which is good) that gives it the added 1/2 inch."
3,not user friendly,I have the Kindle version. I've been TRYING to do the 365 devotional and you have to go back to the contents everyday then to the link and choose the month and day. And if your reading on your iPad you can't choose one month you have to scroll through each month till you get to the one you want.It also takes a long time for it to load each time you pull the book up on either device.It's gotten so annoying at times I've just given up and used other devotional apps. very discouraged since the rating was high. I feel as though it was a waste of money.
3,Life Application Bible for Android,"For the basic bible on my nexus 7 tablet, it is a good program. It does lack the notes, concordance and extras that the book bible offers. I was glad to get the Kindle App for my android which allowed me to get this study bible."
3,I give this Bible only 3 stars,"Although I like the features of the Life Applcation Study Bible, the translation is not as good as I would like. I would much prepfer that NIV kept its' 1984 version. The more modern the NIV becomes the more it gets away from its Biblical Principles to accommodate liberal beliefs of this world and not those conservative beliefs that Our God sent us."
3,life application bible,"It is a great paperback, kind of difficult to use on the original kindle, probably better on a newer kindle."
2,bad,didn't know the print would be so tiny. Too much trouble to return it. My other personal bible was easier to read.
4,Plethora of Information,I like the layout and the amount of information that this Bible offers in the notes. The only drawback is that this Bible is heavy and bulky making it hard to carry anywhere. Hence the reason why I only gave it four stars.
5,Great resource,"I've been using this Bible for a few weeks now and really enjoy it. The footnotes are very insightful and the charts and diagrams have been great for me. I am a visual learner and sometimes I can't make sense of all the genealogy and time lines of things, so the charts have been great for that. This is the Bible my professors recommended for college (Geneva), but I never got around to getting one. The only downside is the size of it. I normally use the thinline NIV, so this is quite a difference. I think I will continue to use the thinline when I'm going somewhere (church, etc) and keep this one for home study. Though, it is always fun to make the ""the footnotes in my Bible"" comment in Sunday School, so I might have to make an effort to bring it just for that!For more reviews, check out my Growing Kids Ministry blog."
3,Finding my way in Life Application Study Bible,"Being new to Kindle Fire, I had to learn to navigate the Book but once I had it to a large degree, I must say that it is very nice and very informative. The maps have rather small writing so not easy to see but still nice to have them plus all the profiles of certain people and the cross refs are very handy."
5,Life Application Bible,This is the greatest study Bible published....I highly recommend this edition to anyone who wants a more in depth study of God's Word.
1,Life Application Study Bible,"I have been out of town for a couple of weeks and on returning home received your book, however, it is not in Large Print....Let me know what I need to do??"
3,Used Bible,"The Bible was in ok shape. However, it had markings in it that were not advertised. Also, it was a much older edition than the one I expected to receive."
4,first time I did not get a deal,"I have been shopping on Amazon for many years. I have always gotten a great deal on my purchases. This was not the case with the purchase of this Bible. I found it at a LARGE local retailer for $10 less. Same Bible, same version. I guess I should look at the money saved over the years and not this one item. So I have vented..."
5,Must have!!,"Must have this !! Easy reading, updated version (2009, have older copies of this Bible, this is new with a different perspective & applications for life."
4,Easy to read,The only thing I don't like is that this is a heavy Bible to carry and kinda bulky. It is easy to read and love the study aspect of the product.
5,Excellent Quality for the Price,"I purchased this bible and the European Leather edition (that cost about $20 more) just so that I can hold both in my hand, with the intent of sending the lesser quality back. I had the expectation that this one would go back because of it being imitation leather. However I was very wrong. This one in fact had a much better quality feel, including how the bible was bound (much higher quality binding), than the one made of European Leather. I was pleasantly surprised. I had hoped that the leather one would meet my expectations, but after some research, the synthetic material made in this bible cover is designed to last a very, very long time. I'm extremely happy with it."
5,Great Bible!,"I really enjoy reading my Life Application Study Bible but I just wish it wasn't so big and heavy. Now I have to pray for strength and muscles to carry this enormously heavy word. If you are seriously interested in understanding the Bible, Life application is definitely the way to go (but maybe buy a smaller size)."
3,Life Application Study Bible,The Life Application Study Bible is a good study bible. But the text is to little to read. I should have ordered the big print.
4,"easy on the eyes, good for the soul","glad this is on a kindle, i've never read the bible so much. I just finished reading Proverbs and Ecclesiastes in just a few ""sittings."""
5,This bible is so helpful!,"I was in the market for a Bible that helped to shine light and understanding on God's word. Some (the Old testament) is hard to understand. But the writers of this Bible have put so much helpful information on every page. It helps me to meditate on the Scriptures, and to apply them to my daily life. This Bible brings to life the authors, the times in which they were written, and how they can benefit us today. It is truly ""life's application bible""."
3,Overall Good Deal,"This is a very cute Bible & I bought it for a friend as a gift who recently started attending church with me & didn't have one. My only compliant is maybe I should have been more careful, I thought the Bible was pink & black, but it is indeed pink & brown. It is a convenient size & stylish...I don't think she'll leave the house on Sunday without it! :) One suggestion though is you might also want to purchase tabs for the books, because this doesn't have any so it is somewhat difficult for new users who don't know where to go to find a particular book in the Bible."
4,Great Bible,I purchased this Bible for a Disciple I class at my church. I have really enjoyed this Bible - especially the footnotes and character profiles in each chapter.
5,mp,great study bible This product was received as promised and in excellent condition. This product met with my expectation. thank you so much.
3,lacks references on each page,"We like the bible, but would like to have the book & chapter on each page for reference. Sometimes we forget the book & chapter."
3,OK,I use a Life application Bible and I thought this would be very similar to the hardcover version. I was disappointed in the lack of footnotes and commentaries. Everything else was very good. I am not sure in knowing what I now do know if I would purchase it again.
3,Life Application Bible,This is a fantastic Bible as it explains scripture in a way the reader can both understand and apply to their own life.This is a used product and not in as good of shape as I would have liked.
1,Wrong Bible received!,I was sure I had ordered the NLT translation becuse all our bibles are NLT. I never payed any attention because I gave it to my wife. Today I looked at it because I was about to order 2 more and discovered the error. Can you make this exchange please? I will proceed with my new order once I hear positive news from you.Thank you for your help.Russel Carter
4,Great for Aging Father!,I purchased this as a gift for my father. He was no longer able to read his bible due to the small font and needing reading glasses. He loves this book. He loves that each passage includes a plain speak explaination of what that bible verse means. He also loves the cover. He is back to his daily readings and I am very happy for him.
3,Archeological Study Bible,I was dispointed with the Large print leather Archeological Study Bible in the fact that it turned out to be a hard back covered with leather. This bible is not like my other leather bibles that I can roll up with my hands like a scroll. Do you have the large print in the leather binding that is flimsy enough for me to roll? please let me know because I fill tricked. I run a recovery house for drug addicts and my business has slowed my getting back to you.K.D.
5,This is the Bible I recommend most.,I am a pastor and people often ask for a reference for a good reading Bible that they will be able to understand... I recommend this one hands down every time. It is easy to follow the footnotes and the study portion are amazing. You cannot go wrong with this Bible whether you are new to reading the Bible or have studied it for years.
3,bible study,I have not used this refernce bible as much as I thought I would; although I am glad to have it in my library for referncing.
2,"Pictures good, theology bad","The Good things about this book are the maps, timelines, and in some cases, the introductions. Each page is about half scripture and half commentary(except in the psalms and proverbs, where there is less commentary). This book not a very good place to study the Old Testament, being simplistic in it's interpretations and sometimes downright false. It says things like ""Reuben slept with his father's wife"" and ""Tamar was a shady character"" which thousands of years of Jewish wisdom say are not true. If you want to study the Old Testament, check out ""Bible for the Clueless but Curious"", or some other source. The notes in the New Testament are helpful when describing historical habits, but is not convincing in truth. All in all, reading this bible(NT+comm.) has convinced me that I could never be a Christian, which I doubt was the authors' intent."
3,A Good Study Bible But....,"The Life Application is a very good study Bible but be careful in using it. It is a study Bible only. The King James Bible should be your Bible of choice when learning scripture. NIV Bibles tend to omit any verses that deals with fasting (i.e Matthew 17 verse 21. In the NIV Bibles you will see Matthew 17 verse 20 then verse 22. Verse 21 is omitted). Again, it is a great study Bible but ONLY as a study Bible."
5,Great Bible,"I ordered this as a Father's day present for my husband. The only thing used was one page with the person's named whited out. My husband loves the book, he doesn't know it was bought used. The reason is that it looked perfect. I'm well pleased, as I didn't want to pay full price for an edtion that he might not like. As it turns I saved money, time and effort purchasing this online and he reads the Bible everyday since I bought it. S.E. Connolly"
1,Defective,Pages missing from the Bible. Page 377 to page 408 are missing. I found this problem when I tried to look at some verses in this part. I have not read the whole Bible so don't know if other sections are missing.
3,A True Study Bible,"The NIV Life Application Study Bible has become my everyday Bible that I use with my Bible studies. The thousands of notes, which are printed on each page for almost every verse in the Bible, and other resources enhance my reading and studies.I was concerned when I read that the translators of the NIV were using gender-neutral language. Too often this becomes an exercise of political correctness, making the text awkward and often silly. The translators have done a good job of using gender-neutral language so it sounds natural and doesn't detract from the spiritual meaning of the Scripture.Some readers will balk at not using upper case letters for deity pronouns. My one complaint is that it often makes it hard for the reader to determine who the pronoun is referring to. Again it is seamlessly used and other than the mentioned awkwardness, I found it not to be a problem for my personal study and devotion.This version of the Holy Word is a good gift for others, and yourself."
5,Bible,I am enjoying my new Bible on my Kindle. I love howAmazon delivered it in a timely fashion. I recommend thisBible to anyone. It is very easy to understand. I can use it in my everyday life.
4,It's PINK!,"I've looked back over the description and there'sno indication that the cover of this Bible is PINK!Okay, they call it ""Honeysuckle Pink,"" but stillI don't think the young man to whom I'm giving thiswill be happy with the color.But, delivery was very quick via USPS and happy witheverything else about the order, but wish I'd had someindication about the cover."
5,Life Application Study Bible NIV Large Print,"This Life Application Study Bible NIV, is the choice of my Bible Study groupat Gurnee Community Church (and to be able to find in LARGE PRINT most helpful... Since purchasing acopy for friend's Birthday,and She was so pleased,I treated myself to a copy..Very pleased with the Book...and with the servicereceived from Amazon...."
5,Life Application Study Bible NIV,I love this Bible on my kindle it works great with my Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World and all other Bible studies.
5,"Excellent! In my opinion, simply the best.",Fabulous correlation to other Books supporting the statements being explained. Attention to the details in explaining the things most people would not know of. There is no need to keep looking for another one because this one is it - the Inspired Word of God we can all understand.
3,Bought this for my NewiPad,"I bought this for the NewiPad and it is hard to use. I have an app of the NIV for my iPhone that I take to church with me instead of this Bible, because it takes too long to get to the chapter and verse. The minister is already on something else before I find the verse he was on. If that made sense. Also, while using this Bible, I can't just look at the bottom of the page to see the ""study notes"", I have to get out of the page I'm on and then go to ""study notes"", look for the verse I'm working on, and then go back and go into the Bible part. So, what I'm trying to say, is that it could have been designed like the real hard bound book of the same name."
2,Do not like new version,"I am a fan of the 1984 printed version of this item and have used it for many years. When I purchased this item in ebook form last month, I did not know that there had been a revision of the NIV in 2011. Since I am a conservative, I do not agree with some of the changes made in the new version. The change I most dislike is the substituting of parent for father. I have searched for an ebook in the 1984 version and have been unable to find one."
2,Difficult to Navigate Around,We find it difficult to navigate between scriptures and to quickly get from one passage to another. We have many other copies of the NIV and even a copy of the Life Applications in regular print-book form. I love the content--but the ease to move about the electronic version is cumbersome.
1,Excellent Study Bible; Binding fell apart in 3 days,The Life Application Bible is an excellent study bible but the binding pulled completely away from the text after three days of use. It appears that the weight of the bible is just to heavy for this binding.
5,Study Bible,"I have the same bible, published in a different year. I bought this as a gift for my mother. I love all the explanations, maps, and commentaries throughout the book. I am very pleased with both bibles."
5,life bible,I originally purchased this leather bound bible years ago. wanted it in my kindle as well. Now I have many bibles in my kindle.
5,LOVE IT,THIS IS A VERY GOOD BIBLE BECAUSE IT HELPS YOU TO UNDERSTAND EACH VERSE AND ALSO HELPS TO APPLY IT TO YOUR LIFE
5,JoyNCinci,"I LOVE this bible!! Its attractive and soft leather cover makes it look nice on my night stand. But more importantly, I LOVE the extra notes, history, maps etc given with The Word. Each chapter has a bit of a ""what makes this book stand out"" in the front of each book with main characters, what was going on historically, major themes and things to think about. I HIGHLY recommend this Bible for those who want to study The Word and get a bit more of historical context."
4,Good Book for beginner like myself...,"I had tried reading the bible years ago but always got lost with the strange language. It was a chore to read and I never did get through it. This book is so easy to read that I really enjoy reading it this time around. I ordered the large print which helps my eyes but that made the book too big to carry around. I keep it in my living room as a reference book. My only complaint is that the pages are too thin and stick together. You need to be careful when you turn the pages or they'll rip. I suppose if the paper was thicker the book would be even bigger so that's probably why they made it like that. Basically, the book delivers what I wanted...an easy to read version of the Good Book."
4,Helpful Resources and Balanced Notes,The Life Application Study Bible (NIV) is one of the best study bibles on the market. I recommend it to the women who attend our bible study.It has excellent resources and notes that help folks come to a deeper appreciation for the Word of God. The notes presented are balanced and give differing perspectives as appropriate.
3,Okay read to fend off boredom,I did not enjoy this book as much as previous works from this author. The title didn't really seem to fit the actual content of the book and the ending was abrupt and quirky. In the end there seemed to be no real lesson or meaning to it all; so this is the kind of book that you read to fend off boredom or on a long airplane ride to keep you occupied
4,Another look at women in the Bible,"Our church group studied this book in the spring. What an eye-opener!These ladies weren't meek or down-trodden. They were manipulative, strong, and in some cases, very much the head of the household.Fascinating reading for anybody who wants a fresh look at the role of women in the Bible - at least in the Old Testament."
1,Not working at all,"I thought the cable would allow an old PC with CRT output to display on the TV with DVI input, but it does not work. The description of the product on the web is deceiving, but since it is too cumbersome to return the thing, I will just swallow the loss."
2,buyer beware,"Just want to state that im a big nickelback fan , I have seen them live twice and have been to sturgis in 2004. My BIG dissapointment with this dvd is that it is edited .This dvd should have been put out as a disney release and does not represent nickelbacks music or sturgis. There is nothing more annoying than a BEEEP in the middle of the song or black blocks covering the crowd when the camera man picks up something a five year old shouldnt see .Wouldnt it be better to show the concert the way it was presented to the crowd and rate the dvd as 18or older. I also feel that the song list should have been longer,and truly hope this is simply not a money grab by the band or their management."
4,Great Music,"The music is great and is typical of Nickelback. I enjoy playing concerts like this when we entertain. However, this is not one that I would play with kids around. The ""F"" bomb gets dropped quite often and bare chested woman are galore. That said, this is exactly what I would expect from Sturgis. The picture is pretty good and the sound quality is great - especially with it cranked up!"
1,wow they still suck.,"The most corporate, sellout, no talent ""fake rock"" band ever. Terrible performance, horrid songs, horrid vocals and just predictable no talent overblown garbage. Garbage with a light show and pyro is still garbage."
1,Bleeping Walmart!!!,"Nickelback released the first batch of this dvd to Walmart. They have the exclusive until March 10. They're the ones responsible for the censorship. Walmart can treat their employees bad, but God forbid if some swear words or ta ta's are shown. After that date the dvd will be re-released in all it's unbleeping glory. It's just very unfortunate that Nickelback felt the need to sellout to Walmart, instead of thinking about their fans first. Walmart gave them a huge pile of money for the exclusive."
2,Sturgis Sterilized,"The performance from Nickelback is fine as always, but this DVD has been heavily censored. What is the point of filming at Sturgis if all of the topless biker chicks are covered up with floating black blobs. Next time, just film at Disneyland!"
2,Should have returned it,"Loved Nickelback live on netflixs , thougth I was going to see them without it being censored which I was lead to believe but that was not the case . Opened the packageing and put it in the trash before I watched the dvd , or else I would have returned it !"
2,Why the bleep did they censor this bleeper?!,"Expert bleeping filming, outstanding bleeping sound quality and then they went and censored the bleep out of this bleeper. What a bleeping shame."
5,very nice,"Great sound, video and set list. Teamed-up with bikers and skimpily clad babes. If you like a good rock show you wont be dissapointed"
5,Great and Stylish Italian Espresso Machine,If you enjoy authentic Italian espresso- you'll love this machine. It's similar to the original Moka pot but is black with white polka dots. The handle is silicone and stays cool. It makes 3 shots of espresso (or one small cup for me!)
2,Huh,"It's not what I expected.I have this book and trust me,after the first time it's read it gets realy boring.Not realy long lasting."
2,A poor quality book,"For 6th edition:One may use this book as a handbook for some statistical problems. However, I find it very poor in terms of reading it from scratch. Moreover, many important issues are not covered, and those covered are not very analysed.i.e. I cant find the transformation of stochastic variables, The properties of the gaussian d. are not fully covered. No Rayleigh or Rice distribution? After all I am not sure this book is for engineers."
1,jester3611,"Be aware that you're purchasing a ""Solutions Manual"". The answers/solutions are to questions that are not in this book. The questions are in another textbook."
4,Easy to Use,"I used this textbook for my engineering statistics class. Overall, the text was very helpful. It has clear and accurate information with lots of examples. I could teach myself the majority of the class material by reading this textbook and working through the practice problems. Also, the chapters are not excessively long. The focus of each chapter is direct and clear.Only gave 4/5 stars because the book is not 100% perfect. There are some small typos here and there. None major."
2,Dont use this book,"This book is terriable. It might be okay if u are very good with intergals...but for those who have taken calculus and are taking stats a few years afterwards..this book is not a very good one. Lack of examples, and lack of explanations makes thei book a horriable one."
5,Author Anapola has a unique perspective,"When the story started I thought the perspective came from Charity's mother Clara. Her life story could be a good prequel or sequel. Very interesting women. Then after the first chapter I realized that I was reading about Charity, a little girl I saw grow up befor my eyes as I breezed through the pages quickly. Then I could not put the book down. My only negative comment? The book is too short at 222 pages. I read Olivia Goldsmith who can go crazy almost close to 500 pages in one of her novels. Maybe author Amapola can make her stories longer. It is good too because I finished the book very quickly."
3,THE BOOK WAS VERY DESCRIPTIVE OF MARIANNES LIFE,I THOUGHT THAT THE BOOK WAS GOOD IN THE SCENCE THAT IT WENT THROUGH AND EXPLAINED HER LIFE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THE BOOK TOLD THE HARD THINGS THAT SHE OVER CAME IN HER LIFE. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ONE OF THIS COUNTRY GREATEST POETS....ERIC COUGHLIN 9-27-99
2,Nothing Five Cups of Coffee Couldn't Do,"Tried these religiously with no obvious results. Made me wired and had crazy paranoid mood swings.Alas, it turns out if you just start jogging or increasing your cardio, it has the effect you want without the crazy look in your eyes."
4,Very happy with my results!,"The process took about two hours total for me, and the end-color is fantastic! I let it 'cure' for about 45 minutes before applying it to my head mixed with a tablespoon each of paprika and cinnamon. I left it on for only approximately an hour because I was impatient and the result was a bright natural red on my hair. I have been dying my hair with chemicals for years and this is the most satisfied I've been with any other dye without having deal with the terrible chemicals and other additives.If you are looking for a great natural red color, this is the best stuff to use on light to medium toned hair. :Pp.s: This stains skin VERY quickly, so I advise you to keep track of where this stuff goes on your body!"
5,Awesome,"This henna dye works great, and it's all natural. It gives my hair amazing color. Couldn't be happier with this product."
5,First time henna user,"I used this item to dye over my traditional chemical hair coloring. I came out the most lovely shade of auburn. I will continue to use this product, as I am happier with the results from this product than I have been with box dyes from the store. Love it!"
1,don't buy,"Don't waste your money on it. When I used it the first time, it didn't put any color on my hair. I gave it a second try, still didn't work. It's really frustrating to see your gray hair still the same after you suffer from covering your head with a mud paste for several hours! I don't want anybody else suffer again!"
4,Beautiful but messy,"I definetly recommend henna over chemical dying. I used to use chemical hair dyes for years, until I discovered henna. While the process is messier with henna, the color is beautiful and natural. Your hair feels healthier after using it. Be sure to leave the color on long enough; definitely do a strand test because henna can take longer to achieve desired results."
5,Favorite hair color,"I love Mountain Natural Henna it thickens my hair, helps to stop fallout due to stress, and the color is fantastic!"
1,Worst Henna!,"I have used several different Hennas in the past and this one is by far the worst. It does not mix well. It is very gritty and does not apply smoothly. It was falling off my hair and on to the floor during application. I've never experienced this before. It made a mess and I did not get the desired result. The color was nothing compared to what was displayed on the box. Also, it was over a week before I received it. I have received other Henna ordered through Amazon within 3 to 4 days. I'm so happy I didn't buy the 3 pack and waste my money. I will never order this Henna again!"
1,$12.99 well wasted,The worst product on the market hands down. Call me stupid for not reading the reviews before hand. They will tear up your ring rip clothes and stab a person in the hand.
1,A syndrome for everything...,"Sounds to me like more Liberal / Progressive pyschobabel. Dr. Spock has ruined this country. What these kids need are involved Fathers and paddling before its already too late and the parents are in this position. God has been taken out of the picture. This epidemic is the result of absent and/or uninvolved Fathers and a society that has embraced Nihilism for all its worth. Which ain't much. Don't be stupid and put your kids on drugs. Your simply ""dumbing down"" a child who probably has the potential to do great things. You probably neuter your male so they have a more ""acceptable"" personality, am I right? If you really want to help your kids, do it naturally. Mike Savage has is an expert on Childrens nutrition and is reprinting his book. Google to find his site and book."
1,Dissapointed,"Others have said it more eloquently but let review my reasons for being disappointed with this text. First, in the paperback edition, the photographs are reproduced so poorly as to be indiscernible. Secondly, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are discussed within the chapter on short-latency auditory evoked potentials instead of being treated in a separate chapter. Thirdly, the chapter on medical imaging is crippled by the poor photographs. Fourth, the chapter on congenital deafness is nearly 2 decades out of date due to advances in OAE, middle latency AEPs and human genome studies. The chapter on vestibular assessment is a nice historical recount appropriate for the beginning student in auditory function.In short; this text is just showing it's age which is no fault of the author. I wish my instructor had spent time finding a better value for my $90."
1,Disappointed in quality of book,"This book was required for a class that I am taking as I pursue my clinical doctorate in audiology. When I received the book, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the book given the price. It is a thirteen-year-old paperback third edition, and the cost was $109. The pictures and diagrams were of such poor quality that I could barely discern what was there. I realize that this is not the fault of Amazon.com, but rather an issue to be taken up with the publisher. I returned the book to Amazon and borrowed a third edition in hardback from a faculty member at my university. I would advise anyone who needs this book to try to find a hardback edition to purchase or borrow.Of course I have great respect for Dr. Jerry Northern. However, the content of the book is more suitable for an undergraduate or entry level class. Hopefully in the near future there will be a suitable book in medical audiology for those at the graduate level."
1,"Sent wrong product, which was also defective","The item on the product page is an RCA cassette adapter. What I received was a Philips cassette adapter. However, I wouldn't have much of a problem with this if it weren't for the fact that it doesn't even work properly. From the sound of it, one of the channels (left or right) seems to be wired wrong, causing one channel to be inverted or out of phase. What this does is basically eliminate any sound that's in the center of a stereo mix. In the case of most songs, you won't hear any of the lead vocals and if you're listening to an MP3 player, random bits of songs will sound like they are under water due to the fact it uses perceptual encoding. It basically turns your car stereo into a very messed up sounding karaoke machine, which is not what I bought this for at all. I will be returning this tomorrow."
3,You get what you get,The sound is good for an adapter. The cord on my last one was very flimsy and got pealed back at the base of the jack so we will see how long this one lasts.
2,Worked fine for a couple of weeks,"This was exactly what I was looking for, however after less than a month of light usage, this morning it started being rejected by the tape deck in my car. It looks like one of the fake spools has started to stick. Too bad, really. I liked it before then. I'm glad it wasn't very expensive."
4,works great,"I bought this as a replacement for the one that I had been using for over a year, so far it works great."
4,Decent Quality,"It gets the job done, but the tape deck pickup does not make for great quality. If you're listening to audiobooks or something at a lower level, the sound quality is great. Once you turn up the volume, you can hear some slight crackling in the background.I am happy with the quality for the price and it is significantly better than trying to use a radio transmitter.Also, always remember to turn your device's volume (phone, ipod, etc) to about 80% to get the best sound quality. 100% volume on these devices causes distortion in the sound."
1,Do not buy this item!,"Hi, I bought this the other day. Immediately it got stuck in my vehicle (an 07 Acura TL -- not an old car) and ruined the tape player. These are pieces of junk and the sellers (upon seeing other research) are known for selling shotty, defective items. They do not answer any contact channels. Do not buy! This is a complete waste and could cost you!Paul"
1,Received philips brand and didnt work properly...,"for some reason i didn't receive an rca brand, I received a Philips brand that didn't work well at all. When I put it in my tape player the left side speakers sounded extremely faded and I could hardly hear out of the left speakers. So not only did i receive the wrong brand, it was also defected."
5,Just what I needed.,Does what is meant to do. Sound is good better than radio frequency adapters. I would recommend this to everybody.
1,Not a good connection,The jack feels loose in my mp3 player and it makes a static noise because of it. Don't buy it.
2,You get what you pay for....,"Not as durable as I would have liked. Suits its purpose but is ""loud"" when playing in the car. A good stop gap measure"
3,Works very well if you get a good one,"I had one of these I had bought at a local store, and it worked very well. Sound quality is excellent. I ordered this one off Amazon, and it had low output on one channel and poor sound quality. Comparing it to the one I already had, I found the silver ""head"" part in the adapter was recessed further in than the other one. I took it apart, and the ""head"" floats on a spring. They had assembled the unit with the wires too tight, which was restricting the head from extending to it's proper position. Once I fixed that, it worked good like the other one, but if I hadn't already had the other one to compare to, i don't know if I would have been able to fix it. Why am I ""fixing"" something that is brand new?"
4,ok,"I bought this for my 2000 corolla, works fine as I needed.. Quality was good and price was reasonable as well..."
2,Crackly Noises,"This cassette adapter, while it does work, performs poorly. It makes crackle noises on strong beats in the music--ruins the experience. I've tested that it is neither the cassette player, nor the ipod malfunctioning; it's the adapter."
1,Didn't work correctly,"I spent a little more for a tape adapter with a name brand, since many of the cheaper ones seemed to have a high defect rate, based on the reviews. Unfortunately, this adapter only played music on one channel. I tested it with two devices and two stereos. Save your money."
3,It works,Works just as it should in a car. Did not work in a boombox with no line out jack. Price is right at $5.
4,Jeep Prototypes - A book for all Jeepers,"This book rocked! I am and have been a hardcore Jeeper my entire life and have had more Jeeps than I can shake a stick at, so when I came accross this book I was expecting to just toss it in the stack with the other Jeep books, but low and behold it is on the top of the stack. Just as I thoguht I have seen all the Jeep ever conceived of, I found dozens more. This book is a MUST ofr any hardcore Jeeper."
5,The Fabled Man for All Reasons,"Lubbock (On Everything)Credited by no less an authority than Joe Ely himself with being a seminal force in Texas Music and with serving as an inspiration for Ely's legendary Flatlanders, Terry Allen is also a recognized artist of considerable standing when he has a paintbrush (or eight) as his work tool.There's one person we know for certain has never heard a Terry Allen collection of songs and that's the individual at TIME Magazine who called Lucinda Williams ""America's Greatest Living Songwriter."" I for one would not enjoy living in a world in which that was true. Listen to this record--especially the amazing ""The Great Joe Bob,"" with whom we all grew up--and you'll understand why the writer's testimonial misses its mark. This is the fella, right here--The Man Himself: Terry Allen and ""Lubbock (On Everything)"" is his top album, from a field without a clinker."
5,One of the great country albums,"I know, I know. Country? Do you pretty much hate the ""country"" music they play on ""Country"" Music Television or ""country"" radio stations. Me to. Willie Nelson, George Jones, Johnny Cash, Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, Merle Haggard, John Prine, Roy Acuff, Hank Willams, Jimmie Rodgers, etc. Those guys play great country music and so does Terry Allen. If you have music by any of the guys above and you really enjoy it, then buy this album.Information tidbit: Terry Allen's son Bukka (sp?) plays keyboards in the Ian Moore Band (or Ian Moore Action Group). They're great live. Check'em out if you get the chance."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"The Wolfman of Del Rio is one of the greatest songs of all time. The first time I heard it I was on a long summer road trip by myself. The repeat button got mashed, the windows went down, the volume went all the way up and I was mesmerized for a couple of hundred miles. The rawness and simplicity of the lyrics captures the strange way we human men and women behave like no other. The range of notes that are perfectly hit way before the advent of digital touch-up is just awesome. I have left plenty of feedback over the years on the internet, but never a review. When I decided to see about getting another copy of Lubbock on Amazon, I felt I owed it to this man to let him what I thought of his song."
2,Only for hardcore fans of quirky country,"This album has a cult following among people who know the Lubbock music scene and among those who admire quirky country music. I was influenced to buy it by people of that ilk, but I'm not an enthusiast myself, and I found the album pretty amateurish. Solid musicians but no standout instrumental work and lyrics that try too hard to be clever."
2,"Much larger than it appears, lacks structure","I loved the look of this bag in the stock photo, but in real life it does not hold to that shape unless it is stuffed to the max. This bag seems like it should have something flat that lies on the bottom to keep it looking like a dome, rather than a hammock. It is definitely too large for just a pair of sneakers, a towel and a few odds and ends (my needs). I will probably stop using this bag for the gym and just keep it for an overnight bag."
3,WCW Halloween Havoc 1992 review,"The 6 man tag team match between the team of Bobby Eaton,Arn Anderson & Michale Hayes against the team of Johnny Gunn,Tom Zenk & Shane Douglas was a good opener. The Brian Pillman-Rick ""The Dragon"" Steamboat match was also a pretty good bout. The US title match between Vader & Nikita Koloff while not a bad match,it was weird to say the least. The World Tag Team title match between the team of Barry Windham & Dustin Rhodes against the team of ""Dr.Death"" Steve Williams & ""Stunning"" Steve Austin was a great tag team bout. The NWA Worlds title match between Masahiro Chono & Rick Rude was...BORING AS WATCHING PAINT DRY!!! The WCW World title match between Ron Simmons & The Barbarian was Shining Through bad. You totally forgot that movie existed. Sorry! The Coal Miner's Grove match between Sting & Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts was like MVP'S WWE debut in 2006: Over-promised & Under-delivered. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10."
2,Typical boring WCW PPV,"If you thought WCW ppv's were boring now, you should see this thing!!! I got it on ppv WAAAAY back in 1992 and it is soooooo boring. The whole ""spin the wheel, make the deal"" thing was really lame, you can tell the wheel was rigged. You should take the 33 bucks and buy a couple of good WWF PPV's"
4,Great product,"Got mine from Target and was very skeptical. It does exactly what it says no more oveheating, great comfortable angle for typing."
3,Little Disappointed,"The order processing and shipping were great. However, I was at Target who had the same product for me less."
5,I love it!,"I'm using this stand as I type right now! I have been using it since I recieved it over a year ago, and I love it!"
4,Belkin CushTop,"Love the ergo design, lightweight, and heat distribution (keeps my MacBook and my lap cool). My only complaint is my Macbook slips off if angled too far downward. Yes, it does have the rubber feet on the underside of the laptop, but, they are not as pronounced as other laptops. The Macbook actually fits inside the notebook stand for storage. But it is a tight fit, so I won't be doing that regularly. Overall, good design and nice color choices."
4,opening could be bigger,"Overall it's a nice product. Nice materials and construction. My only issue is that the opening, which they say can be used to store your power supply, mouse, and other objects, is a little tight for my accessories. My power supply just squeezes in, which doesn't leave room for air to circulate. My mouse, an Apple Mighty mouse, doesn't fit without making me feel like it'll break. Other mice might be fine. Can also function as a dinner tray."
2,Does not help with heat,It is ok as a base but does not help at all with the heat. Still gets too hot.
3,not as soft as i thought...,"with a name like ""cushtop"" i assumed it would seem cushion-y... but it's not. plus, the one i purchased smells a bit weird - not sure if it's due to the fabric material."
3,Comfortable but not heat friendly,"I bought this to keep my laptop from overheating and shutting off on it's own, and it did not prevent this. However, it did help when I put my laptop actually on my lap. It raised it up and tilted it enough to where my carpal tunnel hasn't been bothering me. The overheating does get old and I will be buying something else for this, but I will sit it on this product and then sit my laptop on top of that."
4,"Does what it says, but could be better","I like the angle of the stand (most stands are flat). It also elevates the laptop a few inches which is better for my back and neck. My only complaint is that it's very hard, it'd be nice if there was some give...especially in the middle where you'd like to squeeze stuff in."
2,Just ok.,"I like the height of this stand for working while sitting up in bed. I do not like how hot it gets with my 13"" MacBook Pro. I do not like the feel of the fabric cover - like a grainy polyester. I wouldn't really recommend it."
4,CushTop stand,It's a handy device to have. No more sweaty lap and no more suffocating system fan. It's sturdy but lightweight.
5,It does everything we had hoped it would...,"The CushTop Notebook Stand is a great product. I started my search looking for a cooling fan laptop stand. After reading the reviews of those products, I came upon this Belkin product. My wife loves it and we've even recommended it to our friends with notebooks. If you try it, we think you'll like it."
3,"Wow, I Could'a Built My Own","Well, the product roughly does what it says; it keeps the laptop off of your lap. However, for the amount of money I purchased mine ($20) I could have found a cheaper alternative that does the same. Really, for ten dollars I could have bought a firm pillow and used adhesive to form a hard plastic surface...then I could even eat off of it.The product does as it says, but is not nearly worth the price given; my suggestion is to wait until you see one under $15. Especially because it doesnt provide ""special ventilation""."
5,I use this thing everyday and it's amazing!,I was nervous after reading some of the negative reviews on this product but still needed a laptop stand for when I'm working on the couch. I am happy to say that the product works incredibly well. It provides great support for your computer and is extremely comfortable to use. I have used the cooling pads with the fans and they do keep your laptop cooler but they are much bulkier and seem to be overkill in my opinion. I think one of the best features is the space in the middle of the cushion because you are able to put your laptop adapter in there. Overall a great product that I use everyday!Such a great product I just ordered another one for my wife!
2,Looks good but makes a poor cooling pad,"Pros: soft surface yet very firm. I like how it works with both 15.4"" and 17"" notebooks. Great positioning for using while sitting in bed or on the couch.Cons: Does not allow your notebook to breathe, there is zero room between the top surface and the bottom of the notebook. Belkin claims that the fabric allows for air to move freely but I have had my notebook shut down 3 times due to overheating, and that's no bueno!This is a poor solution for cooling, if you have a notebook that tends to run hot anyway due to the way you use your notebook, burning DVD's, downloading, copying files, severe multitasking and maybe harware(Dual core, 4 gigs memory)find another solution.I ended up buying an Antec cooler (looks like a silver X) and I set it under the Belkin which makes it a little taller than it was before but like I said the lift and angle of the Belkin is really nice."
1,Do not order this product if you have a 17inch lap.,"The GoodIf you have a 15.4 inch laptop, expect a great product that is stable and not wobbly. I tested it.The BadIf you have a 17inch laptop, expect a product that does not support your laptop effectively. ""Flip it over and presto you have a surface for a 17inch laptop"" Hardly, the base is now smaller then the top. When moving it off your lap, you have to be extra careful the laptop does not tip over, because it will. ( I tested this on a soft surface, completely top heavy on the screen side and fell right over) This is an accident waiting to happen with a 17inch laptop. The manufacture should be ashamed to advise this for use with a 17inch laptop. Because this was obviously designed for a 15inch laptop."
3,Not as good as it looks,"I have a Macbook Pro and a sony vaio. I bought this stand after reading all the great reviews.My findings are as follows:1) Its definitely comfortable to work on.2) The surface is a bit coarse. So while working in shorts, I feel a slight irritation in the legs. Then I checked the pics here and noticed the model is wearing long pants :)3) The smaller surface works perfectly for a 15"" laptop. Both my laptops fit just fine.4) My sony vaio is a heat machine..probably as hot as the sahara desert! I didnt find a great improvement in heat control here. Its definitely better than placing the laptop on ur lap, but after reading all the reviews claiming heat reduction, I was slightly disappointed.So 3 stars for this one from me. A decent choice but not one of the best."
3,Not really a cushion,"The CushTop is a well-made item. However, it is unnecessarily large--both width and height. As a result, my dog can't lie beside me and, more importantly, the keyboard is at too high a level unless you sit with your thighs slanting downward (which I don't in my La-Z-Boy). The storage space is essentially useless: I'd have to force my Dell recharger into it and it's not wide enough to hold 8-1/2 x 11 papers. The hard top is a good idea; I can use it to do Sudoku or crossword puzzles. But because the item is (unnecessarily) reversible for different width computers, the part that touches your thighs is too hard. In fact, calling it a ""cushion"" is misleading; it is just a firm insulator. Overall, I like using a folded-up bath towel better."
1,Customer Service Worthless,"First let me say that I love the product. I bought two as gifts and one for myself. Great product! But I bought it and paid to have it sent 3 day shipping so it would be here in plenty of time for Christmas. It didn't ship out for a week and then took 5 days to get here. I contacted the company by e-mail to cancel my order two days before it shipped, since I hadn't hear about it shipping yet. I got no reply. After I got e-mail conformation that it had shipped I tried to contact them again....I have still not recieved a reply....."
5,comfortable,Belkin F8N044-BRN CushTop Notebook Stand - Chocolate w/ BlueIt is more comfortable to use my laptop with the CushTop notebook stand. Great product!
3,OK,"I found it to be rather higher than I thought, however it does station my PC more securely. It is well made and light weight which is a plus. Would reccomend it for a specific purpose."
4,Nice product,"Nice, durable and practical product for in house use.Yet a bit heavy, and bulky to store as there are other foldable products out there."
5,Great!,Bought two of these as Christmas presents for two of my daughters for their lap tops. They loved them! Could sit on the sofa without having to prop up laptops with pillows or sitting in an awkward position to hold them up.One of my daughters is away at college and says it's great if she wants to sit on her bed to do her work instead of at her desk. The laptop doesn't slip or slide because of the material. Would recommend them to anyone using a laptop.
5,"Bigger than I thought, but works great","I purchased this laptop stand for a completely unintended purpose, and it works great for my need! A few weeks ago I got my first pen tablet for photo editing. But I do this on the couch often with my laptop, so I needed to elevate the tablet to the correct height. The CushTop provides the perfect height, with a surface that keeps the tablet in place, and the slight incline provides a natural angle for my arm. I have the Wacom Bamboo tablet, and this stand is a little oversized, but not too bad. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a similar solution."
5,Most underestimated accessory for a laptop,"This may be the most underestimated accessory for a laptop. Ever since I discovered the CushTop, I cannot imagine using my laptop without it. Forget all those USB powered cooling systems. They are not nearly as convenient as this one on your lap.It is a simple product with high quality materials and finish and is very light on the lap.It may be a little difficult to carry around everywhere you go with a laptop like office meetings, presentations etc, but then you don't place your laptop on your lap in those situations. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure almost everyone has enough space to carry this in their luggage, vehicle etc."
5,Great Product,It's very sturdy and LIGHT! I like the side handles for lifting the pad.It looks sturdy enough to think it will last several years.I like the color options to go with one's furniture.Great job Belkin!
3,Not for cooling,"I was very happy with the comfort that this lapdesk gave me, but once I actually started using it with my laptop, the heat from my computer transfered through the lapdesk. If you're looking for something that cools, don't get this. If you're looking for something to put your laptop on when you're sitting on the couch, it's a good buy."
5,lap desk,"I love my lap desk it keeps your lap cool for hours. It has a place for your mouse or your cord if you want to store them. I would definitely buy another if I ever wore this one out.This company is good to deal with, fast delivery, no problems at all."
5,Put those big books back on your shelf!,"This is a great product! It is a sturdy pad or ""cushion"" that allows you to use your laptop while on the couch without heating up your legs (or crotch).It is well made, attractive, and an excellent design. The hollow center allows one to manage cables and it also functions as handles so you can securely move the open laptop and pad at the same time.The pad is reversible so it accommodates 15"" laptops or flips over for 17"". One side is level and the other is angled so it gives the user additional options.I bought this at a store so I was able check it out first. Amazon's price is $10 cheaper than what I paid. If you've been using books, pillows off your couch, etc. this pad is definitely worth it!"
5,No more hot lap!!!,"Almost ordered this from the Skymall magazine when flying home from a vacation and would have paid a lot more. This is great to keep the laptop and your lap a lot cooler. It keeps your neck in a much better position when using the laptop for extended periods, too. I love mine and never use the laptop without it."
5,Great !,It's great! It doesn't get hot from my laptop. The price I can't argue with. Other chains sell it for much more.
2,"Nice stand, but no help for the heat at all!","I like the stand for on the bed, but my laptop heats up just the same, too bad."
3,OK,"this trimmer line is ok, i dont know if its my weed wacker (stihl) or the spiral twist in the line but i've had some feeding issues with.. It gets caught on itself so it won't feed right otherwise when it does, works great and cuts down anything.."
1,Too hot to handle,"This mug does a great job keeping coffee hot. Unfortunately, you can't actually pick it up to drink the coffee.The problem with this otherwise fine mug is that there is no insulating grip on the outside of the mug. The thing gets REALLY hot, particularly around the ribbed area in the middle (you know, right where you'd normally find the insulating grip). It's hot to the point that you really can't pick up the mug in the center for about the first 15 minutes after putting coffee in it, which kind of defeats the purpose. It is too dangerous to use in the car since I can only pick it up by the top, which leads to spilling hot coffee all over the place. I'm normally a fan of Farberware travel mugs, but I'd steer clear of this one. Mine went into the trash after a couple uses; it's just too dangerous and impractical."
1,100% stainless seel!,The on-line description indicated 100% stainless steel and did not display the inside of the mug. It's plastic! I would never have purchased a plastic lined mug.
5,Commander Cain and the Pegasus!,"What more can you say? Well, this one is superbly written. Greatly expands on the two-part TV show The Living Legend. Most people may not realize, but this book is actually a flashback for Commander Troy (the intro explains this). Baltar and the Imperious Leader are ever at it again to destroy the Battlestar Galactica, and this book probably gives one of the largest insights of the Cylon's side of the war and why they went to war with the humans in the first place. Don't pass this one up if you're a fan of the original BG TV show."
2,Top ring flimsy,I like this type of feeder as they have always been very durable except when a bear gets a hold of one! The bear is the reason that I had to buy another feeder. I decided to try the double decker. I was really surprised and disappointed when I saw that a squirrel (I don't know what else it would have been) had bent the top rim in his attempt to get the seed. Hopefully I will be able to straighten it as it leaves a nice gap between the mesh and the metal top. Apparently the top ring is not sturdy enough. I am very disappointed in this feeder.
3,Alot of seeds wasted!,Very heavy when full - seeds fall through the holes easily - especially when trying to fill it.Squirrels love it - easy for them to hold onto!
3,Not what I expected.,"Based on good reviews, I purchased the feeder, but because I did not read the ""fine print"", I bought the wrong kind of feeder. The fine print says the feeder should be filled with sunflower seeds, not small seeds such as millet, which comprises about 90% of the kind of seed I buy to use in a somg bird tube feeder. Therefore, small seeds fall through the mesh anytime the feeder is disturbed. So, read the full description of any feeder you buy or you could make the same kind of mistake that I did. I am sure the hour-glass feeder is quite suitable for large seeds."
3,Disappointing.,"Come on guys...I want to see and hear a real live performance. I like the band and I think John West is a tremendous vocalist. However, if I want to hear perfect vocal performances, I'll listen to the studio albums. This seems to be the trend now with many live DVDs...go back in the studio and re-record. Disappointed."
3,Cute idea....very difficult to do....,"The idea of a floating green is cute, and the kids were excited to take turns at their hand at golfing onto the floating green. The game is very difficult to do. The adults in our family had a very tough time even hitting the green unless we moved the green very close to the edge of the pool where we were putting. Not for the easily frustrated child!"
5,Very encouraging!,"I was a vice president and product manager with a stock brokerage firm but, due to corporate restructuring, I'm no longer there. I have been networking to find a new position (I want to make sure that I land in the right spot) and Marc's book has re-enforced what I have been doing and let me know that I am heading in the right direction."
1,Stick with the rechargable model.,"After having trouble finding replacement heads for my original Sonicare toothbrush, I purchased two of these toothbrushes thinking that it would be convenient to have something that didn't have to be plugged in to charge and would be compact enough to take away. Didn't think I would have to replace the batteries very often, after all you only use it for 4 minutes a day! Well, was I wrong! After the first week, the batteries needed replacing every 3rd day. Customer service replaced the product but the problem continued with the new ones. Additionally even when operating with new batteries, sometimes the brush turns on for only a few seconds, then shuts off. I have just mailed them back and am awaiting my refund. For $35 each this is not a cheap product! I expected much more from Philips. I would definitely NOT recommend this product."
5,Sonicare E3000 is Great Value,"I am extremely happy with my almost 4 month old AA battery powered E3000. The price is 1/3rd that of the rechargeable versions. I just replaced the batteries, so, I would be on a schedule of 4 sets of batteries a year. My previous rechargeable Sonic brushes were not good for travel, either because of the extra space for packing the recharger, or dealing with different plugs and voltages overseas. In addition, the rechargable versions wouldn't hold a charge after two years. At this price, I could buy a new E3000 every 12 months and still save."
2,Died after six months,"I got one of these, and it worked fantastically for some time. I figured it would be a budget way to get the Sonicare clean while at the same time working through my enormous collection of AA batteries. Well, it was good while it lasted. Even at six months until expiration, it's still probably the cheapest way to get the clean I want, so I ordered another one."
2,Expensive and short life,I installed these bulbs March 2012 per instructions. The performance (brightness) of the bulbs have slowly degraded and one of the two bulbs have burnt out. Based on performance and durability the bulbs fall short of expectation. I am going to switch back to factory spec bulbs at just 30% of the cost of these bulbs.
2,Bright but didn't last long,Purchased these bulbs. They were easy to install and nice and bright. My issue is that one is already not working. Not a quality product.
3,Short life,"I have been through two sets of these bulbs in less than 2 years.When they work, they work wonderful. They deliver a bright white light (not blue). I have been installing them in my 2011 Victory Vision motorcycle which is infamous for the difficulty of changing headlight bulbs. Because of this I'm going back to a bulb that will LAST!!!"
1,Save your money - don't purchase this hoop.,"I purchased this floating hoop for my 12 year old brother to use in our soft-sided backyard pool. It looked sturdy and easy to maintain (didn't have to inflate and deflate it). Once it arrived, we assembled it and took it out for a trial run. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!! The hoop is so incredibly top-heavy that it was constantly falling forward. Basically, someone had to stand there and hold it so it wouldn't keep faceplanting in the water. It would hardly stay up in calm water, much less in the turbulence created by an in-water basketball game. We got sick of messing with it and never used it again. Waste of money!"
2,Satisfactory,I just want to say if you have every song and remix by korn then save your money and see if they release a fallng away from me cd with all 3 remixes of the cd. if youre a die hard korn fan like i am then buy these limited edition singles. these remixes are pretty cool but not worth the money they sell for.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,"This is an AWESOME water filter! It is so easy to use and clean. It is more than handy when hiking, going on long bike trips and camping. I mean, there is only so much water that you can carry. At first, my husband and I thought this filter was too expensive, and tried to do without. Let me tell you, when we were in the middle of nowhere with little water left, and a creek nearby, we regretted sooo much not having purchased this filter earlier. As soon as we got back, we ordered one, and we absolutely love it. It is well worth every penny. It is so well made, and delivers everything it promises. Now, we never bike/hike/camp without it."
2,Poor durability,"The inlet connector broke after the first day of our 7 day canoe trip. We are not rough with our filters as we have had our other filter for several years with no issues like this. We just wanted something that wouldn't clog so quickly.We spent the rest of the trip either floating in the water next to or leaning over the side of the canoe with the filter submerged to enable us to pump clean water. Also, there is a little plug under the ceramic filter that will stop all water flow if it gets pushed in. This seemed to happen if the pressure in the filter built up by pumping too quickly. We had to disassemble and reassemble the filter several times to correct this issue.When the filter was working, it was fast and filtered very well. The ceramic pre-filter was great. The water was clean, clear and tasted great. If this filter was more durable I would give it 4 or 5 stars.Hope this helps anyone in the market for a water filter."
1,works well for a minute,"I bought one of these units along with a few replacement parts, and went camping for a weekend. It worked great that entire weekend and I purified about 2 or 3 gallons of water. However, the pump started leaking water at the seals after that - even after replacing the ceramic filter and other parts that need to be replaced.It's made from plastic, and its made in such a way that the plastic and seals fail under the pressure of pumping. The unfiltered/contaminated water leaks into the area of filtered water that you want to drink.So it became unusable after one weekend of use. I can't recommend it..."
1,Missing Parts!,I ordered this filter for myself and my family prior to our most recent hiking trip. Upon assembly of the product we found that it was missing the strainer and strainer barb. We had to go ahead and use it anyway. I hope the filter isn't ruined and I also hope we all don't die!
4,Fast and cool,There should be only more tips and tricks in the Manual. Filtration is fast. I couldn't try it in real emergency situation but so far it's working as it should. Plastic handle should be also little bit more solid.
5,Christmas list!,"My son and 2 grandsons are planning on hiking the Appalachian Trail this spring and this item was a ""must have"" on their list of things for Christmas!!!!!!!"
5,quick replacement,"I ordered the water filter and much to my dismay the little tip that holds the tygon tube was broken. So I tried to get the part from the filer company but they did not have it as its from Switzerland. So I completed the online return and replace form with Amazon and they emailed the link to find the docs to print out and include in return box and I ordered a replacement, no charge, unless I dont return the original within 30 days, which I have since sent. GREAT. The water filter was sent to Malawi, where it is truly needed and reportedly works great. The replacement came VERY quickly, in time to catch its flight with a friend. So thanks the return system works very well."
2,Katadyn Vario,"Only had the luxury of using it once but it worked great. Light weight, easy to use, and would definitely recommend to another for hiking or camping. I brought a 2.5 gallon collapsible jug filled it up in under 5 mins."
5,Have not used it yet.,We have not used the device yet. It arrived well within the time promised and well packaged. We bought it for use should we need it in an emergency.
4,Solid Piece,"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the Vario with the exception of it feels a little cheaply made, that and a heads up about filtering about a liter through the new filters is prudent, had to be told that by a guy at work when I got it. It now presently sits in my hiking pack, ready for when I need it."
2,Dainty Plastic Filter,"This pump only worked once. On my second trip the intake connection had broke off. The filter was packed well with no heavy objects around it, but broke anyway. Save your money on this one. Spend the extra cash on something more durable."
2,plastic housing broke within first 4 uses,"The plastic housing that goes over the pistons broke almost immediately. I can't find out where to get a replacement. Our Sweetwater was much more reliable, although it, too, broke twice.I'm not impressed."
3,ok,"it's ok. sometimes it'll leak out from middle if pump too fast, this can be dangerous if you're in cold conditions. Also if using in below freezing temps water will freeze over the ceramic filter allowing no water to pass through and a lot more leakage from sides. This is the only water filter I've ever used so have nothing to compair it to."
1,Leaks,"This pump is great in theory, but the design is poor. The seal for the pump head leaks at any moderate flow rate, certainly under the specified 2L/min (or 1L/min for longer life setting). The water then drips directly into your water bottle. There is no way to just screw the head on tighter to make this seal tighter, so you are forced to pump at extremely low flow rates. Oiling the O-rings helps some, but it does not solve the issue, and it is not worth oiling them every single time I want to get clean water.This is not an issue of me abusing it as I have treated it with extreme care. It also isn't because I have been using it for too long. I have pumped less than 30 L through the thing and the water source was always clear, fast flowing water.I am sending it back and asking for a refund, I would recommend looking at a different pump."
4,A great filter for the cost; works well,"This seems, from a limited number of uses, to work well. Used it in concert with a camelback system and a couple of nalgene bottles. Filled up with stream water both in the States and in South America. It's not the heaviest duty filter I've seen, but I treated it gently and didn't have any issues. Have never heard of a cheaper unit which actually works well."
4,best night lotion,"I tried this lotion from my local drug store. IT has little pearls that burst open when you rub it in, and work on your body all night long. NOw the stores near me aren't carrying this version: dunno why: IT's awesome!!!"
5,The Well Worn Path,"I am very pleased with 'The Well Worn Path'. If you follow the details in the book, you will find that the deck tells a beautiful story. I can already tell that this deck is going to be very helpful to me on my own path. There is a companion book and deck (The Hidden Path) that really should be sold with 'The Well Worn Path' as both of them, together, offer a path to a wonderful way of life."
4,Review,"I like this deck but I can't say I love it, I need to workwith it more as I find it's more of an oracle and I preferthe 78 card type... It is certainly a well made deck & thepackaging so that it can be kept in good condition if storedthere... The cards are good quality. I will probably rate ita 5 after I've worked with it more, as I find I do that fromtime to time, come to love one I start out liking."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,This was the first year I used AMAZON for Christmas shopping and I must say I wish I had done it sooner. Everything was shipped in a timely manner and arrived in time for Christmas. While I have not personally read the books I can report that they arrived in beautiful condition and the recepients were more than pleased. I am now a great fan of AMAZON and will continue to use them in the future.Deirdre Robbins
2,Not at ALL what I was expecting!!!,"I ordered this set because I LOVED Tom Green in ""Freddy Got Fingered"". I remembered he had a show on MTV some number of years ago, but couldn't really remember it so I figured this DVD set would be packed full of laughs for hours on end. I was SOOOOOO wrong!I got through about 8 episodes and had barely cracked a smile. There is no real basis to his comedy expect him standing in a public place yelling, making obscene noises, or rolling around on the ground. (I think someone else wrote almost the exact same thing on a previous review)."
5,"Good product, beware of size","This product is great by all accords. If you are buying it for a handgun, beware what else you want to secure in it. A glock 23 with 3 magazines and the loader is a very, very tight fit. The fitting was my fault though. The product is second to none."
3,Not for compact pistol,"The case is very good quality, but is too small to store a compact gun. My gun is a CZ P07 and don't fit with a extra magazine..."
1,Pelican Case,It didn't meet my expectations...There is no metal reinforcement on the padlock holes.one two three four five six words required ....
4,Good Shoes,"Good looking, comfortable shoes. Wore out my first pair and liked them enough to replace them. Gave them four stars because the soles on these shoes didn't last as long as other shoes I've owned."
5,Florsheim Corbin,"my second pair and I can say this is a winner, soft, confortable and style; and yes, I guess I'll purchase a third pair if by the time I need'em they'd be available in market."
5,Great choice!,"I've been buying this model shoe for years, I absolutely love it. It looks great and feels comfortable. They're long-lasting and goes nicely with any dress paints or jeans! Highly recommended."
3,nice for that price,"the Florsheim shoes - Corbin dress - slipons are a just alittle to large in the number - 10,5 W. in shoes like this you cant wear a thicker sock, but maybe an inlaysole can compensate. when you buy shoes/jackets or any clothes on the internet people from Europe have to be asure that numbers are correct, - I cant return this shoepair, because the cost of returning will be more than the cost of a new pair.in addition the choose of shippingcompany is also a point - Sheplers.com sent me a motorcyclejacket and I urged them to send it by international UPS, but they sent it with DHL which has an endingstation in Oslo, Norway - but since I dont live in Oslo it cost me 55 US $ extra, but they didnt care. but the seller here was ok, but I missed the tracking.Th Myrseth - Norway"
3,Eh,"My cat loved it the first day, but since then she doesn't react to it at all. So this product may be hit or miss over the long term for other cats."
3,My cats don't react much to this.,"I have given my cats this catnip, and they don't really react much at all from it. They just roll around in it, and that is all. They don't get catnip that often, so I don't know if it is the product, or that my cats have a high tolerance to catnip. Thanks."
2,"Good Stuff, but OVERPRICED","I was surprised when the catnip arrived to find it was only a one ounce tin. The listing did not say how much was in the tin (my fault I guess). I just found the same size tin of this same catnip at a high end natural food store for only $4.95. This is good stuff, but overpriced and can probably be found locally for a lot less."
3,"Used to be very good, but last one I received was terrible.","I've ordered this a few times, and the cats loved it. It used to be a nice green color, with plenty of buds, basically very good quality. Unfortunately, the last one I ordered was of completely different quality. It was dark green, and finely ground up, and basically looked like dust. I'm returning my last order. Not sure if it was a fluke or if the product has been changed. I'd buy it again if it was the same stuff as before.."
5,Super potent!,"This stuff is incredibly potent. My cat could smell it through the shipping packaging. After I pulled out the tin, before I even opened it, he was already rolling around."
1,No cats liked it here,"My cats looked at it and then gave me the biggest look of disappointment. They had more interest in applesauce than this. Literally. It did come in a really cute tin, though..."
2,Not a hit with the feline judges,"For some reason my cats show no interest in this catnip. It smells fairly fresh, is packed nicely, and arrived in a timely manner, but unfortunately the cats barely gave it a second look. They enjoy catnip well enough, just not this particular batch. I was happy to pay a little extra for a certified organic product, and the nice tin container, but alas I won't be purchasing this again."
2,Did absolutely nothing special,"I figured I'd splurge on this for my cats but none of the 4 we have cared for it very much, no more so than other brands we've tried. It's not worth the premium price as far as I'm concerned. Every cat is different though so maybe you'll have better results."
2,Too expensive,"I purchased three tins of this catnap for myself and gifts.Total cats = 5Total cats that liked the product = 5Total cats that loved the product = 0So, I would just as soon buy cheaper alternatives that the cats seem to enjoy more.Nothing against this product, the cats just didn't love it as much as other products and it was rather pricey for that outcome."
5,Drunk,"Before this brand, my kitten seemed to care nothing about catnip.If I sprinkle some of this on toys or the floor, she will roll around in it. Her eyelids relax, and she looks for lack of a better description, drunk. Very cute!"
3,"No ""Wow"" from My ""Meow"" Crew","I smelled it in the container, and it did not smell as nippy as I had expected it to smell. But I was hoping maybe my cats might think differently. After all, I am not a cat.I don't know what the ""it"" factor is for catnip, but my cats know it, and apparently Sojos doesn't have ""it"" for them.Some people mention on here that perhaps something was changed about the brand at some point in time, as their cats are reacting to it differently now.Mine do like Cosmic and Frontier.We'll be going back to their favorites.~~>> ""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming like the passengers in his cab."" <<"
1,No Wow,"Well, my cats were totally uninspired by this cat nip. But from reading through all of the reviews it certainly seems that many cats do respond to it. I've only found one brand of catnip so far that my guys are crazy about but unfortunately I don't remember the brand, only the little muslin bag it was packaged in."
5,Sojos Organic Catnip,I have tried other brands of catnip and so far this brand is the only one my cat goes bonkers over. My kitty will roll and scratch at the location I place a small amount of this catnip. My cat only sniffs at other brands of catnip. Great for adding to cat toys. I have noted a stronger sent in this brand compared to other of lower price. I recently purchased a similar ranked brand from Amazon and got no response from my cat. After sending this review I am placing an order for another tin of Sojos Organic Catnip.
3,"Kitty says: ""Meh....""","I was surprised that my kitty-boy was not very excited by this product, especially considering the cost, and the fact that this is ""organic"" catnip. I expected that I was ordering something that would be an irresistible treat, but he's not crazy about it. Personally, I think that the catnip looks and smells very good: fresh, aromatic and high-quality. I just wish that my cat was as impressed as I am. I also love the tin, by the way."
1,No reaction!,My kitty just ignore this catnip. He shows no reaction.I feel like I just wasted my money on this.
4,Catnip,This seems to be nice quality catnip because my cats really love it and you can smell it as soon as you open the can. This is expensive but probably worth it. i recommend it for people who think their cats doesnt like catnip because now they probaably will! I have two tiger cats and this is the only catnip that gives them a buzz. I tried several brands and they seem to like this one the most.
5,very effective!,This has proven to be excellent catnip. The cats can't resist it and one of them gulps it down and then lays there and trips out and plays for a little while. Most certainly will buy some more of it when this can is done. Not sure the kitties would settle for anything else at this point. They love this stuff.
5,Finally a nip that works on my cats!,"Delivery was on time. This catnip actually works and my cats cant get enough. I have bought all types of catnip at dollar stores and grocery stores and none of it worked. I didnt have high hopes for this product to work because i thought my cats werent responsive to nip, but boy was i wrong. This is a must buy for cats that have not been responsive to other brands of catnip. I beleive that Sojos may be the strongest and best catnip to buy and if your cat does not respond to this catnip, chances are that your cat may not be responsive to catnip. This is some good stuff and my cats love it.... Puff Puff Pass kitties. 5outof5"
3,Hit or miss like all cat nip,"My cats enjoy consuming the cat nip but don't act particularly stoned or funny as you would hope. The fancy packaging doesn't make the nip any more effective, so don't believe the hype. Like all cat nip reviews this one is highly unreliable. All cats are different but I do have 2 male cats and neither one really loves this one, so there is some anecdata for you."
4,Powerful herb,"I have purchased cat nip a few times on line this being one of them. However this nip is more potent than others, for my furr baby maybe too potent. Other cat nips got her all lovey and rolling around on the floor, however this one made her aggressive and growl like she was peeved. She ended up running around the room like she was crazy for five mins. We are going back to some mellower nip."
5,My cat loved it,"My cat absolutely loved this catnip. As soon as I put it out she was all over it, literally, lol! I have purchased different brands of catnip before, but this is the only one I have seen that actually gets my cat excited. I love the tin can that it comes in. Will defiantly purchase again."
5,The Best Of The Basics,"These great early childhood songs that teach basics like, letter sounds, friendship, numbers, colors, and music are sung by Ben E. King (Stand By Me), and that makes this album of wonderful songs, extra special. As I watch my young early childhood students sing and interact with these songs, I think that this collection is the best of the basics and want to thank Bobby Susser for bringing Ben E. King with him to the children."
5,"The Very Soulful, Early Childhood, Basic Skills Album","Children's songwriter and producer Bobby Susser, who always adds something new to subjects he teaches and writes about for children in preschool classes like mine, stays true to form on this CD. He continues to use original catchy songs and great productions to stimulate my class of young children. On this CD he includes songs and activities about colors, numbers, rhythms, letter sounds, holidays, and friendship. All this plus the voice of rhythm 'n blues singer, and rock 'n roll hall of famer (Stand By Me) Ben E. King. The soul that comes from Susser's songs and King's vocals is gauranteed to raise a high level of enthusiasm in young children and keep it there."
5,Susser And King=GREATEST BASICS,"I am the supervisor of three day care centers and personally coordinate music and arts into the children's daily activities. I get great pleasure playing these songs at the piano while the children sing. It's a dream come true to see and hear the children respond and learn from this marvelous CD. The songs are written and produced by Bobby Susser, who's the greatest when it comes to communicating with the children through music. The guest singer, chosen by Susser, is (Stand By Me) Ben E. King, who keeps getting better. While we are not sure that Bobby Susser asked Ben E. King to 'Save The Last Dance' for our youngsters, it sure feels like Mr. King did.Susser and King will be applauded for years to come by teachers, parents, and their audience, the children."
5,Simply Great,"As I have said several times, watching my nursery school class respond to Bobby Susser's songs tells me over and over that Bobby Susser was born to write songs for children. Here we get an additional treat by having Ben E. King sing these wonderful Susser songs that teach letter sounds, movement, rhythm, friendship, colors, numbers, and other basic skills. ""I Have Songs In My Pocket"", is a fantastic opening song that is Susser's life story by its title and sung by King and a children's chorus that gets the whole class singing and clapping. This sets the mood for all the songs here that are simply great."
4,Welcome addition,"This is book is a welcome addition and sheds much needed light on the phenonmenon of Castro. It is thoroughly researched and quite lengthy-perhaps too much so however. After completing a masters degree in Latin American studies and pouring over the vast literature on Cuba, I definitely recommend this book but suggest reading others on the topic as well. Cuban studies is such a politicized field and it is remarkably difficult to find academics, pundits, and others writing in this area who aren't completely biased in one way or the other. In addition to this book, I recommend books and articles by Jorge Dominguez, who is probably the most noted scholar writing on Cuba today."
4,A very thorough account,"This is obviously a well reserched book. Sometimes a little ""heavy"" in depth and to extreme detail, however the detailed account of his younger years helps to understand the type of person he is! In power for over 30 years(longer than any contemporary leader) Quirk gives a good insight to how such a person strategically thinks and the effect of charisma. His obsession of not conforming to the Western capitalism economic order to become a subservient economy to the rich Western nations appears to give him incredible drive and motivation. If you want to gain some knowledge about Castro, this is a good one!"
1,truly pathetic -- don't waste your time,"Truly pathetic, borderline-propaganda crap. I'm not normally so blunt in my comments, but this book is so biased, I don't think it even deserves the time I'm taking to write this (nor the time I have already invested in reading it!). If you are interested in a more objective biography of Castro, there are many to pick from -- this is certainly one of the worst, even among the most vehemently anti-Castro titles I have read.Perhaps I shouldn't give this title such a horrible review... this author's totally conspicuous lack of objectivity might alert some readers as to the incessant propaganda that attempts to pass as unbiased reporting about Castro."
5,A classic,"I submitted a review of this CD a couple of months ago but it never saw the light of day. This is a GREAT album folks, full of pain and joy and life lived hard and well.Townes Van Zandt was a great poet and a great spirit and the world is a poorer place for his passing.My favorite tune on this one is ""Cowboy Junkies Lament.""Ah, Townes. Thanks, man, for singing for us."
3,Keeps Missing,"This book appears to be good until one tries some of the recipes. The pear and hazlenut tart is confusing in it's instructions. It reads as if one were to put a pastry shell inside another pastry shell and I'm sure this isn't what the author meant. The crust is too much for the size of the pan but not enought to make another tart. It also has too much butter so that it seeps out. The rhubarb upside down cake has a very flavorful cake but it is way too delicate to go well with the assertiveness of rhubarb. The banana cake is leaden.These are the recipes I have tried thus far. I have been doubtful of trying more after this experience, however many of the flavor combinations sound too good to pass, so I will try a few more."
3,"Almost there, but no steam.","McMurtry's follow-up to the 1995 ""Where'd You Hide The Body"" doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor. ""Paris"" and ""No More Buffalo"" are definately standout tracks, but the rest of the album is slow moving and the songs seem to have no destination. It basically winds up being an album of songs that run too long and it lacks those characters that McMurtry is so noted for creating in his first three releases."
5,Good effort,"Have been a JM fan for about 3 years now,bought ""live in Aught-three)first and loved it.I like this studio effort just as well, ""sixty acres"" is a real toe tapper. McMurty's ability to spin a tale of hardworking, rural, open space livelihoods is fantastic. I will be investigating more of his work and no doubt obtaining more."
5,Dell 19 inch monitor 1905FP,"This is a great monitor. It delivers a crisp and sharp image, just like the name - UltraSharp. I particularly like the USB hub on the side, so handy. I also like the adjustable height. This was a terrific bargain."
2,NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE,"If you ever plan on using vista, do not buy this otherwise good monitor. I upgraded to Vista and the display is fuzzy. I will now have to downgrade back to XP. If you are buying this new do not do so if you ever plan to run vista on it."
4,So far so good...,I love my new Dell monitor! I would definetly recommend this product. I received the Dell Flat Panel on a timely basis and it was well packaged. No damage! It was easy to connect to my PC and so far so good. The picture is great and easier on the eyes as oppossed to my old monitor. I will update if for some reason it doesn't hold up.
2,Can Get By,These chips are OK if you really are craving a potato chip type snack after doing without for a while. They are rather bland however and shortly become almost undesirable. The full case was much more than I needed to keep from become anything other than fully pleased.
5,gift for sister in law,I have the best feedback from a gift I have ever given!!!!!I intend to more of this item in the future.thanks Buddy
5,AMAZING KNIFE!,"My girlfriend has gifted me a set of Kyocera ceramic knives. . . and I just **LOVE** them! The only problem was that there wasn't a SMALL paring knife in the set.So, for Christmas, I got one for her, and one for me!I LOVE these knives! They are ***VERY VERY VERY*** sharp, and stay that way... its also nice that Kyocera has a warranty on them if they chip, break, whatever....The knives came PROMPTLY and I am SO glad that I ordered them . . . I'll be seeking out this seller in the future!"
4,great knife,"Love this knife!! This is the second one that I own and I live it! It stays sharper than regular knives and if it should need sharpening, you send it in to have resharpened. I found my first knife at a kitchen store and the owner said she has had her's for 2 years and has yet to sharpen it! I want to own more!"
4,Ceramic knife,"Fine knife for veggies. Not sure why it can't be put in the dishwasher, but hand washing is quick."
5,worth the money,Love the knife and have recommended it to friends and family. I plan to purchase more of this brand.
3,Begining to dull after 6 months,I was surprised to see my 6 month old Red Handle Kyocera sliding across the skin of a ripe tomato instead of cutting into it. I used my steel knife to cut through the skin and went back to the Kyocera to peel the tomato. It has gotten quite dull over the past few months. I am waiting for the sharpener to be released to see if it will restore a sharp edge.
4,Very sharp,The knife is very sharp and time will tell how long it stays that way. Everytime I use it I look at it wondering if this is the time I will drop and break it. The only thing that would improve it for me is to make it dishwasher safe. I don't enjoy having to wash it by hand. Boy I am lazy (thought I'd say it first.)
3,delicate knife,"This is the 2nd knife I bought. It's a great knife with qualifications. The tip broke off of both knives within a relatively short period of time. I thought the 1st knife was perhaps my fault. However, my wife broke the tip on the 2nd and she is much more careful than I am. I have become a fan of ceramic knives, but I think I'll look for one that is a little sturdier. $25 a pop is too much to pay to keep replacing these knives. This must be a common problem because on Kyocera's web site they advertise a service to re-grind the tips."
2,Wet spaghetti,"I used this today for the first time. I went through this stuff like wet spaghetti. Doesn't cut that great. It so flimsy that it just wants to wrap around the trimmer head. Oh well, I only have about 800 more feet of it to use up but at this rate it wont take long. The only good thing I can say about it is that I really like the color of it. Orange is one of my favorite colors."
5,Great,"Great Commercial String! Decided i needed to upgrade to commercial string so i thought this...i cut grass part time and have seen full time pros use colored string such as red and orange..this string is orange!. Ordered it online, shipped fast and before you know it, it was here and I WAS putting it on my trimmer! Great service , would recommend"
2,Way Out Of Date,"This little book needs to go away. The version of GIMP that it describes is long gone and not missed. The contents is nearly all useless, and there are so many better books on GIMP available."
3,Good set of items,"The stickers were great, quite complete and perfectly adhesive. The water bowls were a good size, but didn't attach very well. So the dogs knocked them off right away. If you can find a way to be sure the bowls stay attached, I highly recommend the kit."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have a very large dog, and while looking at kennels to ship her back to the states with me when I move from Germany, I decided that it wasn't going to be feasible for me to purchase a new and found a used one at a great price. It, however, did not come with the required food/water bowls. I'm not worried about whether the food/water bowls stay up or attached properly or whether the food and water stays in them during the plane ride, as it's only 8 hours and she won't eat or drink without my presence anyway. I just needed them to pass through customs and the laws here. The stickers that came with the set stuck very well to the kennel and I don't foresee any problems with them falling off during the drive to the airport or the flight itself. Great purchase for cheap!"
3,"Maybe not worth the money, but came in handy","I bought this kit because I thought it would be necessary for shipping my cat from Orlando to Honolulu. Although the carrier I bought came with food/water tray, I found the bowls in this kit to be a little deeper, thus I used those instead. The ""pee pad"" was a nice fit in the carrier. It did it's job well, although it didn't soak up ALL the urine. The stickers were absolutely unnecessary because the airlines provide the stickers for free at check-in. One thing the kit SHOULD have are zip ties. (Although the airlines also provide zip ties for the carrier as well.)All things considered, the kit was not necessary. I would recommend just buying a ""pee pad"" if you have the bowls already. Only buy this kit if you are a person that needs to have stickers on the carrier when you get to the airport."
3,It's okay,"This product is okay for the price. The cups did not fit in the carrier that I purchased, the Cayman 2 pet carrier. The stickers are great though"
5,Got what i paid for,There really was everything needed to ship an animal. you can just write up all the info and put it on yourself if you but it really is easier to just fill in the form.
3,Adequate But Not The Best Available,"Fairly flimsy plastic food and water cups are not likely to survive multiple trips. Labels are fine but the crate pad is a waste. All in, the comparable product from DryFur.com is a much better buy."
3,"Should be Marketed as ""Bonus CD"" to Lunatico","This is a very brief music CD (about 15 minutes!); one original song (Title track) and two remixes, plus two videos... OVERPRICED!!!"

5,"The Last Coach: A Life of Paul ""Bear"" Bryant","I bought this book for my father. He is an advid Bear Bryant fan and Alabama fan. He is not much of a reader though, but when he saw this book he just loved it. He has enjoyed it better than any other magazine or article we have found for him. Thank you very much."
3,Just The Bear Facts,"This is an enjoyable read if you knew little about Paul Bryant going in. It does a fine job of outlining the facts of his life:born in Moro Bottom, played at Alabama, coached at Maryland, Kentucky, Texas A&M and Alabama, became college football's winningest coach etc., etc. Excepting a fine section on the Bryant-Wally Butts ""collusion"" which resulted in a hefty lible award against The Saturday Evening Post, there is little flesh to the story. Barra does little to shed light on what made Bryant the giant icon he became."
2,Major failings by author Barra,"The book has two failings. One is the rash of errors, ie: It's not Fr. Hessberg, it is Fr. Hesburg; Paul Hornung was not necessarily the top high school player in the nation coming out of Flaget in Louisville. Many thought he was not the top player at Flaget - that was Sherrill Sipes who choose Notre Dame when they agreed to take Hornung as well; The kick after a touchdown is an extra point, not a field goal and the claim that Alan Page was the first black player at Notre Dame in 1964 is way wrong. Notre Dame had many black players before Page going back to the early '50s.Secondly, I feel there is a little too much adulation and reverence shown to a man that was an admitted alcoholic and womanizer and who put winning football way above other more deserving facets of life.I think author Barra should have researched his facts better and if Bear was the last coach, we're well rid of them."
1,Terrible!,"Yep...the ""wine"" barrel actually was labeled Engine Oil on one box. On another it was ""harnyies"" oil. But that one's handle broke off just lifting it out of it's packing box. Junk. Straight to the land fill."
2,I wouldn't write home about it.,"I've been a cat owner my entire life. I didn't find any revelations about cats in this book. All the information seemed like common sense for people who are cat lovers. Perhaps this book would be a good read for someone who is a new cat owner and is very interested in details. If you are trying to find a solution for your cat's behavior problem, this book is probably not a good choice- it is written in a descriptive/narrative style, not in a do-it-yourself-help style."
3,It was okay,I liked the beginning with the chemistry and physiology of the cat's mind. And that's about it. I don't even think I finished this book - it started getting into cats in their natural habitat rather than how it relates housecats. I tried reading it twice but stopped in the same spot - too bad they don't sell just the first few chapters!
2,Not what I expected,"It was very flimsy and had very little room for error, I find that amazing in a child's product, as new sewers always make mistakes. I would not recommend this item to anyone. In it's defense it was exactly what I ordered but not what I expected."
3,Easy to make - not very sturdy,"Construction of this bag is easy if you have a sewing machine and can use it. I adapted some of the instructions to be more sturdy, but even so, the use of the rings and loops fabric is not sturdy to hold much of anything - while it does remain decorative. My 6 year old enjoyed the craft project, but now does not use the bag much."
2,poor service,The company I bought these from was horrible. They sent me expired pills and wouldn't return my email or calls.
3,Ok good for commuting,"Ex-federal Security Agents are being killed and a daughter of one of the killed men is kidnapped. Why? What is so important that retired people and being killed?Based around Canberra, this mystery/thriller (More mystery) is rather exciting with a minor shoot out at the end. I thought the baddies were a little easy to overcome, but why quibble when it has to fit into a 198 page book. One to dip into whilst on a train or bus and easy to get back into."
4,"Great textbook, good for learning about other's religions.","If you're a missionary, I would highly suggest picking this up and learning about the main religion of the area that you're going to before you get there.I read through this book for one of my classes and I learned a bunch from the class and I would highly suggest reading this if you're dealing with other cultures on a regular basis (or if you just want to learn about them).Very thorough, but not too dry at all. Many textbooks get dry, but this one holds your attention!"
4,Good blues,"I saw him at the music festival in Lake City, Colorado but he didn't have any albums for sale at the event. So I had to pick it up later from Amazon. Look, it is what it is. You cannot compare him to the more noted musicians out there making millions and flying around in personal jet planes, but the songs are worth hearing when in the mood for it. I would have been just as happy to listen to a recording of his performance at the music festival as I was to listen to the polished version done in a studio. Actually, for this kind of music, I'd have preferred it. On the other hand, Snake Farm is still in the CD player after a few weeks so..."
4,THissss CD is Fun,"I had to buy the CD after I saw him perform ""Snake Farm"" in a small concert. If you like Ray Wiley Hubbard, you will love this CD."
5,True Soul Music,"Friends ! This is true soul music. I roll and I tumble with the music of Ray Wylie Hubbard. This music will rock your soul from the slow Blues of `Purgatory Road'On `Growl' to the confessional ""After All These Years"" on `Eternal and Lowdown' to the heartfelt vocal of `Drivin Wheel' on my personal Ray favorite `Delirium Tremeloes' & Ray's own personal statement `Cooler-N-Hell' also on Tremeloes. Oh and did I forget Ray's version of James McMurtry's `Choctaw Bingo' which is easily the soft white underbelly of `American Pie' that radio programmers didn't want us to hear. In a world of choices, make this choice. Pick the soulful music of Ray Wylie Hubbard and connect with yourself. Pick any record at all, pick them all, I did !"
4,"Hubbard, Bingham, McMurtry","I've been listening to Hubbard for quite a while and enjoyed every note. Ryan Bingham has similar roots to Hubbard. His video is on You-Tube. James McMurtry has a more Dylanesque bent in his songs with some comedy. (Condi, Condi.) Thanks for the comments."
1,Disappointed,"This is the same old book I had versions ago. I really liked these books but they haven't updated them and the book I JUST bought still refers to ImageReady which has been defunct for quite sometime. They removed the version number on the cover so I ""assumed"" it had been updated - nope. Now I have 2 copies of the book - same content, different covers. Bummer."
2,Not a good value for your buck!,The table is fairly sturdy but one paddle came bent. There were also no directions. This is tooo small for teenagers. Want company to ship me a new paddle!!!
2,Not Worth the Money!,"We bought this pool toy last year and was so excited by the concept of the game, we ignored the negative reviews. Unfortunately, the reviews were accurate and the toy was a great disappointment. While the quality of the ping pong set was fine, the design of the toy was not. The playing table is too small, therefore making it virtually useless in the pool (or otherwise for that matter). I wish we had saved our money!"
2,Floating Pool Pong Table,This product is not worth the money. The paddles break easily. Don't leave the table in the sun; the plastic covering warps in the heat of the sun. It lasted one summer.
2,Fun While it lasts,We are on our 3rd purchase of this product. It tends to last about one season. You can extend its life by keeping it indoors out of the sun while not using it. Once you get used to the board and paddles it is really fun and the fact it can move with the water adds an extra challenge to the game. Overtime (about one season) dead spots tend to form on the board which makes it unusable. If you leave paddles outside they will warp. Wait for out of season prices to drop to $50 or below and pick one up and enjoy at least one season of fun. Also be aware that packaging can be problematic but no worries if you buy from Amazon as the return and replacement was relatively painless.
5,Fun option for the pool,"A little difficult to play ping pong with but then again anything easy doesn't provide much challenge, however it was bought to adapt to a college after classes game in the hot summer days and after buying a few additional items it is perfect and has been used many times. Built well and sturdy. The old folks love it as much as the kids..."
2,Perhaps I should've known what reading ethnography would be like ...,If you have ever had contact with empoverished and/or drug addicted city folk then I'd skip to the summary on this one.
1,"anecdotes, jargon, and just plain sludge.","Based on Rory Miller's recommendation I bought this book along with several others. It is verbose, rambling, anecdotal sludge. Miller's books are excellent. Im puzzled that someone as insightful and concise as he would suggest such sludge-fests as Beggars and Thieves and The Gift of Fear. Fleisher (and De Becker) both suffer from the lack of a good editor."
3,well i was planning on groing my sprout,"i was really happy i finally got a sprout to grow, and since im a nature child and im really into plants and about saving the animals and having a clean enviroment, i though that this would be a good idea. soi was reading the can and i was opening it, and it says 'instructions on the inside' so i look and it had no instructions /: im really bummed, and i dont know what to do, or how much to water it or how much sun to give to it, orrrr if i should talk to it. so i was wondering, can anyone help me here?thank you"
5,Just Do It!,"It's really quite simple: if you want to reach your full potential as a guitarist and truly find yourself as a musician, get this book, read it and live by it."
4,excellent kick in the pants,"I must admit that I was a little skeptical when I stumbled onto this book. I was searching for Dream Theaters new album when Amazon showed that others who had bought the album also bought this book. Hmmmm...I said to myself. I'll check it out. It was only [item price] so might as well. I must say, after browsing through the book, I must say that it is an excellent kick in the pants musically. If you are a proficient guitarist with some knowledge of music theory and feel that your playing is somewhat stagnant this WILL get you out of the rut. Now, it is not a book about some sort of technique ie. speed, riffs, arpeggios, etc. But what you read will cause you to develop new techniques right off the bat. Ever tried soloing just on one string for 10 minutes? Come on, its only 10 minutes...I challenge you to try it and then see if you don't play something you have never played before. This is the sort of thing that the book challenges you in. good luck"
5,The best!,"As many other guitarists, I try to constantly improve my playing and improvising. As a self-taught musician, I purchased several books on jazz guitar methods, improvising and so forth. This book really so far has been wonderful, it feels like that I am re-discovering my instrument. In my opinion, this is a must-buy for anyone who seriously wants to improve his/her playing skills, improve his/her technique, and is willing to work hard on it.Here are some reasons why this book is a great buy:1. He makes you improvise on one string at a time, a wonderful and very important concept. And you do this way before working on 2 strings, or on position playing.2. Overall great music theory, and insights from a very experienced musician.3. no tabs (in my opinion this is an advantage)4. endless material to work withThis is the best guitar book (that I know)."
5,Good Stuff,"I recommend this slim volume, full of very useful information and suggestions, to all guitarists who are beyond the beginner stage and looking to fill out the many gaps in their knowledge that will exist in all novice players. Mick hits the spot precisely in knowing what we need to know and what we need to do to develop good technique. It will keep me busy for a year!"
2,"Some nice ideas, but not helpful enough on exercizes","The introduction in the book makes a big deal about how this is a book where YOU do all the work. He really means it. There are some really great concepts here and some great exercizes, but they take too long to figure out. Before you buy this book, you need to know how to read music for a piano and apply it to the neck of the guitar. It would be a much better book if he at least suggested some fingerings for the chords he wants you to play."
5,Great book... but you must do the work,"This is not a method. It's a conceptual approach that helps you open your mind to the possibilities of the guitar. The book does not contain a lot of ""practical application"" examples. You have to figure out how you want to apply this material. The author explores the complexity of the guitar and puts it in perspective...an admirable achievement. Great observations and insight into the learning process. Deep stuff!"
2,Maybe if we had different door handles...,"We currently have round door handles and as soon as my kitties pull on the toy, it comes right off the handle... so they tried it for a couple times and never since... I might try some modification to make it tighter. Hopefully someone from the CFA is looking at these reviews and in future designs they can account for this.CFA Doorknob Dangler Cat Toy, Mouse"
3,Palm Z 22 only costs about $ 99.00 NEW.,"Best Buy sells new ones for $99.00 USD. I would not pay more than that price for one of these products. It's a pretty good product for $99.00, just take proper care of it."
2,Kinda Weird,"Kind of strange and hard to figure out. Strange controls and hard enemies like ghosts and hard to hit spiders. I played this game once and never did again. It has cheesy graphic effects and a freaky story line. If you're interested, rent, don't buy it."
5,good good good movie music,"For an entertainment that's undergone as much criticalscrutiny for the admittedly wide gaps in its story'splausibility, I must say I liked ""Signs"" a lot--enoughindeed to see it twice. And this music is just aswonderful to experience as a CD playing in the background of my life."
1,signed off,"I usually love James Newton Howards scores but this one seems to have something seriously missing. His previous work for M Night Shyamalan (Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) was fabulous but Signs seems like it was the wrong genre for him, or something.The whole thing just seems to be music effects with no real theme or emotion. At best this score sounds like a second rate Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Like the film itself, a real disappointment."
4,"Good Soundtrack, but gets boring...","Signs was a great movie, and it's soundtrack was good too. The first song had to be the best, repeating the same simple notes over and over again. I could see that song being used in Haunted houses during Halloween. It's creepy.They only problem was that after a while, the repeating of the same 3 notes got kind of boring.Overall, it's still a good cd."
4,"James Newton Howard's ""Signs""","While in search of the ""sleepy hollow"" score, I saw ""signs"" placed in the J section. at first I had planned to simply put it back in its place, but i decided to give it a listen. so there I am in the music aisle at Borders jumping at every string leap. it really brought back memories of the film. I'll probably buy it later, but for now I'm off to get the ""planet of the apes reimagined"" score.I wouldn't call it oscar material, though. unless it gets off on the 'simple yet effective' call. it reminds me of jaws because signs has the same three notes changing in pace while jaws has those two heightening the tension. you can't exactly read to it, but it's still very fun."
3,"good, but ..","this score is missing something. i'll say that up front, but i'll also say that if you were a fan of this movie, and you're a fan of james newton howard, you'll enjoy this. basically all of the tracks are variations on a recurring theme, which makes this score somewhat repetitive. it's a score that is used more for the effect of seeing the imagery combined with the music - for the movie, in short. it's not something you can just pop in and listen to. however, i will say that howard is one of the better artists in hollywood - i would suggest his score of ""the sixth sense"" which is brooding, melancholy, and ultimately wrenching emotionally. while it, too, hinges on the same theme, it does employ more difference in the variations. this score might also be worth having if you are a fan of Bernard Herrmann or perhaps the soundtracks to the older horror movies, as it evokes that sort of atmospheric, stomach-tightening terror."
5,Signs,"The product was received in a timely manner and was found in ""as described"" condition. Well worth the dollars spent!! Thanks a lot."
5,Jim Howard,"James Howard has done it again. ""Signs"" is a beautiful score, just like some of his other work. I think that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a wonderful score. He is very good at what he does. Even though I only have 5 soundtracks of his, he is still my favorite composer. Unbreakable was a little bit more modern or rock n rollish, but I think it is just another masterpeice of his. Anyway ""Signs"" has a lot of well written songs. Jim uses a lot of violins in his music and they are my favorite instrument so I really like that. I can't wait for his next score."
5,ATTENTION BIBLE LOVERS,"If you like to study the bible, then add J Vernon McGee to your list of authors. His books takes one book of the bible verse-by-verse and explains what it means. I am learning so much from his books.This is a great seller. Highly recommend. Book came in excellent condition."
3,remixes and more remixes,"This single only has three songs on it; the album version of falling away from me, a remixed version, and a remix of got the life. The remix of falling away from me is a good one, although the remix of got the life isn't that good. But this single does come with a cool mini poster, so I do recommend it."
3,Not a very good design.,The plastic buckle of the belt broke the very first day. A typical battery weighs 30-40 pounds. The buclke is made up of cheap plastic that cannot survive the weight.
3,"Great Idea, could be better","This product is a great idea for a boat or camping. The problem I have is that the retaining buckle broke almost immediately (this apparently happens almost 100% of the time based on other review sites) and it states that it is universal for 24/27 series batteries -- it is not ""universal"". I have a 24 Series battery that will not fit properly in the box. I plan to buy a properly sized battery box and remove the connectors/wiring from this box to make a quality box. Quality?!?!? That's a word seldom heard!?"
4,Would be great if batter meter worked properly,"This is great unit at a great price, except the battery meter does not work properly. Even after fully charging the battery the meter shows 1/3 full and if you use the battery even the slightest is shows needs to be recharged. I measured the voltage and 12.6 volts or less shows recharge, and you don't get to full unless a battery charger is attached and are at 13.8 volts or higher. So other than this minor issue it works great."
2,battery box,before i bought this i looked at the reviews... one person was right. its good price wise but the strength isnt. the handle pops off and the battery test shows a full battery at 1/4 charged. the 12v cigarette lighter adapter comes in handy and the terminal posts are easy to use and attach my trolling motor to. over all not bad for the price and after 3 years i still use it.
4,Only problem,"The size of the box was not shown in the ad. So when I received it, it was too big and I sent it back. It looked great! I would bet that it worked great, if it would have fit."
3,"Pretty good value, but a silly design error","This is a very large board/box with large pieces. Makes for easy play, though the set feels casual. One big complaint: the latch mechanism sticks out below the bottom edge when it's open, so it does NOT lie flat on a table. And the latch part will scratch up your table. I ended up taking the latch off with a screwdriver. This is simply a poor design."
4,Nice but with design flaw,"Very nice Chess Set for families, not too fancy. The pieces have a good weight but are not heavy but we love the size. This is really what we were looking for in terms of quality, size and price point. The only thing is the latch is not aligned with the edge of the case, therefore when you open it up and lay it flat, it is raised ever so slightly on the one side. Not noticeable if you playing on the carpet or table-clothed table. However, on uncovered furniture it WILL scratch. Thought it was something we could fix after we received product since other reviewers mentioned this flaw, however, you can not. Otherwise, we are happy with set."
1,be cautious,This book has a typo on nearly every page and an error in nearly every code example. I have a hard time believing that a book with so many errors could help you prepare for a test -- unless it's supposed to be testing your ability to catch the errors! I wouldn't trust it.
2,Did anyone actually read this book before releasing it?,"I recently purchased this book as a study guide for my MMCP exam. I've read many excellent books on Flash 5, including ""Flash 5 - Dynamic Content Studio"", ""Actionscript - The Definitive Guide"", Flash 5 - Actionscript F/X & Design"". So far this book is confusing and frustrating. It has conflicting information, multiple typos, and just plain wrong information. There's a section where it discusses this really great accompanying website with lots of exam information and a practice test, unfortunately they don't list the URL anywhere. It's been very disappointing. The only highpoint has been the fact that it comes with a 15% off coupon for the exam cost through VUE. After the 15% off the book is nearly free."
3,Mixed,"I agree with the other reviewer. The book refers to a mysterious URL where readers can find corrections to the countless errors. However, I spent an hour looking for the URL in the book and never found it. There's a section that discusses the benefits (including practice exams) of using this mystery URL, but, alas, it's a mystery.The book is a worthwhile study guide. Currently, no other book is as exam-based. The questions and answers in the book mirror Macromedia's sample exam questions. The format also facilitates fast review.Overall, I give it three stars. It would have been a lot better if it didn't seem so hastily put together."
2,Dissapointing,"Although the book covers all the sections it does not go deep enough. For example, there were at least five or six questions on XML in the exam but the book merely skims the surface of the topic. There were issues about browser versions that are not at all mentioned in the exam. Please do not use as your only exam guide!"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Unacceptable amount of typing errors, code errors. The front of the book says...Everything a Flash developer needs to know to pass the Certified Flash Developer exam....haha, yeah right! First of all it should say everything a developer needs to know about Flash to help pass...etc. The book does not mention scripting in ASP or any such middleware software to connect to a database. The Q/A's are wrong as well.....well most of them are correct but not too difficult. I recommend reading and using the Flash Bible and avoiding this book, unless you are an extemely knowledgeable in Flash Development, as with the errors you can not fully grasp the main idea of the book. I give it 2 and 1/2 stars. The cover should also be rewritten as it is misleading....""Everything a Flash Developer needs to know....etc"""
2,Just Took The Exam and... I Didn't Pass,"Like other reviewers, I agree that this book has interesting, limited information about Flash 5. The exam though, is about 50% about XML, browser integration, the loadVariables command, which are covered in two whimpy chapters. The exam also had a question about PocketPCs: Where was that covered in the book?"
2,sends a questionable message,"I bought this book based on its description, thinking it would be a great little story about accepting people's differences. However, after a couple of times through, I gave up trying to put a favorable spin on it for my little girl. While it is a fairly entertaining little story, it is marred for us by the message that David's father is acceptable because he is so big and frightening that he scares people into giving the children what they want. David's father is cool because he's a bully? It seems to me we already have too many ""might makes right"" stories."
3,Not my favorite Munsch,"On the surface, this story has everything I like about Munsch's books - over-the-top situations, silly things - but I just don't like it.I find the artwork unappealing, and the storyline a bit dull. And while David's father chasing away bullies is a good thing, for the kids to then take advantage of the situation and get free stuff is a bit much."
4,Definitive Brahms,"A wonderful read, this is a great story for musicians, music fans and anyone with an interest in 19th century European culture1"
4,biography of Johannes Brahms,"Reading from the very beginning, this writer brings the flavor of a novel to the life and history of this great composer. Recommend it highly to anyone interested in the life of great composers or great musicians.SJ Mackenzie"
5,"A great portrait of a MAN, not a COMPOSER","As I noted in the title of this review, this book is a great portrait of the man who was Brahms. The fact that he was a great composer is almost seconary. He had a fascinating life, with a great deal of personal intrigue, and a great unrequited love story spanning most of his adult life with Clara Schumann. As a musician, I appreciated the clear and understandable way that Swafford writes about the music of Brahms. His musical analysis is of sufficient depth for the me, and is not ""dumbed down"" material for the reader who is not musically trained. The best reason to purchase this book is the great and interesting man (and composer) who is examined. I highly recommend this book."
5,Breakfast with Ramblin' Jack,"I had breakfast with Jack, Sunday, August 10, 2008. Jack was in town for the Regina Folk Festival. I was @ The hotel he was staying at, for a pre-fest breakfast with friends & family, Jack came in for breakfast, we introduced ourselves & he kindly asked me to join him for breakfast!I've been a long time fan of his since my teens and my older brother & I (deceased 1983) used to listen to his 'Young Brigham' album, and particularly the song '912 Greens' - a rambling talking Kerouacesque blues that had a profound emotional resonance for the both of us. He didn't play '912 Greens' at his concert, but he did play his wonderful version of 'Don't Think Twice, It's Alright' from that album. Precious memories. 'I Stand Alone' is ample proof that Jack has still got it and is aging like a very,very, fine old wine. I also gave him a copy of a cd: 'Living in The Boom Times' - a country/roots project I played on. Hope he likes it."
3,A collection of scraps from the editing floor,"This ""album"" is a collection of brief samplings for a total of half hour of listening. The title is rebuted by the great side-men (and woman) who are also on this recording. Just when I think the song is developing a real drive and emotional momentum, the cut ends and goes on to something with a completely different mood.Yes, Ramblin Jack is great. But this one is put together like some kind of teaser for a real album."
3,Big Fan,"I love James Patterson. I miss him and looked very forward to hearing this CD. I guess I was not careful in reading the selections. They are not my favorite songs except for ""My Son"". He was the greatest."
3,Live performance problematic,"Normally, I am not a fan of live music. Hearing audiences clapping is not what I purchase music for. This is no exception. Also, Frank Patterson (who certainly does have an excellent Irish tenor voice) tends to sing his songs too slowly on this album. Zesty songs should be sung quickly, and these all seem to be on the slow side."
1,shaft alignment handbook,"Lots of verbiage, but just where is the technical,practical hands-on ""beef"" I need to accomplishactual aligment of small machinery ??"
1,National Audubon Society Field Guide to N. American Mammals,Poor for my needs. Didn't have the mammals I needed. Not at all comprehensive.
5,The best ..................,"These are the BEST field guides we have ever owned. We have the trees, western USA birds, trees and sealife ones and they are a wonderful size and fit easily into a coat pocket or glove compartment of ones car and of course a back pack. They make a GREAT gift and during the Christmas season a great stocking stuffer.They are so complete as far as information goes, telling the reader what the migration and nesting habits are, where the birds can be found and they have wonderful photographs that are so useful when out on a hike. Our son loved them growing up and with a set of binoculars on a hike a person can find hours passing and not realize it.The covers on the books (vinyl) make it easy to keep them clean. Buy at least one and I assure you, you will be hooked.........."
3,useful textbook for the beginning student,the chosen textbook for my private brazillian portuguese class has bridged the gap effectively between in class instruction and home exercises
1,The book has not arrived!!!,I do not really hate or love it - I cannot review or evaluate - the book has not arrived yet.
2,"Scholarly, but not an ""LDS Perspective""","This book's title is a misnomer. The text reads like it was requested by the LDS Church to counter claims made in the DaVinci Code. To that end, the authors focus almost exclusively on reaffirming the divinity of Christ, and discounting the Gnostic teachings found in the Nag Hammadi manuscripts. They do this using Protestant scholarship; Mormon scripture and prophetic teachings are almost entirely ignored.If you're hoping for a book that explores LDS teachings on Jesus' marriage, how Mormons interpret the early centuries of Christendom, how the different views espoused at the Council of Nicea match restored doctrine, etc., you'll be sorely disappointed, as this book doesn't even mention any of these topics."
5,Better than the round line,This line is not round. It looks like it is six sided. These edges provide a better and faster cut than round.It also seems a bit more durable than the old type line I was getting at local stores.
2,Flimsy and breaks easily,"I had high hopes for this line, but it was not to be. The line is way too flexible, so it tends to deflect when you get into heavier grass/weeds. And then it breaks easily (even more than some 5-year old line I have sitting on the shelf), so I'm constantly refilling the spool. There's better stuff out there."
4,Works,"It breaks too much going through heavier weeds and hitting anything harder than plastic and will Not cut through Wood more than 1/8 Inch thick that would require use of a hedger, I have been preaching to manufactures for years to make a Electric weed trimmer that can use 0.130 Inch line and Metal blades."
4,Highly recommended for all types of readers,"This book truly deserves a raving review. I have read a lot of litterature on the subject but this book is the one I have been longing for. It is comprehensive, practical and very easy to grasp. At the same time, as the authors have professional experience from valuation, it is very insightful, both regarding valuations and the process surrounding it. A must have for anyone interested in corporate valuation!"
1,Same songs on bonus of Flushed Away DVD,This DVD is a waste of money. These songs are already in the bonus features of the Flushed Away DVD! Save your money and do not buy this! VERY VERY VERY disappointed!!!!
3,waste,"I have had these for 2 years, used once and they now sit in a drawer. The ice freezes hard, not like gel pack ice so they feel very stiff on the neck. You have to pull the bandanna tight for good cooling contact with skin. They melt fast. The fabric is cheap and my neck was covered with black fuzz. Quite awkward feeling and looking."
3,Neck stays cool for a half hour,"It's pretty handy to use this neckband to cool off, and it keeps cool for about a half hour. Good for cooling of in the desert - if you have a way to chill it again. For bike riding, the thing heats up and you're out of luck."
2,Do not stay cold.,These bandanas do not stay cold for longer than a half hour. I work in a very hot environment and these did NOT keep me cool.
2,It's a waste of money,"The ice packs don't last very long. I bought extra ice packs, but I had no idea that I'd have to exchange them so many times to keep cool. If you only have two, or even four, you'll be waiting for them to freeze. I bought 10. I have MS and keeping cool is important. I have a few of those neck wraps that swell up when you soak them in water. Those actually work better and stay cool longer. I also found it to be rather large. It's a better fit for a man with a larger neck. Not so much a woman because you'll have to wear it as a loose fitting necklace. I found that I need to hang on to the knot/tie so that the ice pack actually touches the back of my neck. Other than the thickness, you barely know it's there if you don't. Definitely better for indoor use. Outside in very hot, over 95 degree weather, not so much."
2,Too rigid and thick to cool,Great idea...just doesn't work. The ice melts within 30 minutes outside. If you don't wet the liner there is no cooling at all. The bandanas feel like dogs collars and stand too high because they are inflexible. I even put two ice packs inside one bandana in hopes the cooling would be better..but they are too rigid and got not more cooling than using one pk. Will probably use the bandana without ice pack as bandanas for the dogs.
1,Much better products available,"This bandana doesn't cover much, and doesn't cool much. Instead - try theChill-Its 6602 Cooling Towel, BlueCooling Towel.This towel is much larger and has more options. It can be wrapped around your neck, or head, shoulders, etc. And the cooling power is much greater. Plus, it does not need to be kept in the freezer, but only run under cool water."
4,The Plug,The plug was the exact item i needed. It arrived on time. I will purchase from the vendor again if available....
1,noting new,I found very little new in Manhunt. The book seems to be a rehash of newspaper articles with maybe a local interview thrown in.The errors were easy to find. Bad punctuation and grammatical errors are on found almost every page.Save your money and your time. This is not a scholary work and not a very well done book.
1,Man Hunt - The Eric Rudolph Story,"I would not recommend this book. It has plenty of grammatical and punctuation errors, and gives proof that people in that area of North Carolina are not very educated. Furthermore, the author seems sympathetic to Rudolph, and I find that very offensive!"
4,Great product,"The docking mount works well with my treo 700wx. It charges the treo at the same time. The speaker can be set very loud and can be used as a handfree kit in your car. The only concern is that it only give your windshield mounting option, but no dashboard mounting or vent mounting option. But you can talk to Semsons and they may throw the dashboard mounting to you for free."
5,It will turn your CD green...,"Many moons ago I saw these boys at Roger Brown's in Portsmouth VA and bought this album at the t-shirt stand. I really did wear it out from playing it so much and had to buy another one! It is quite simply brilliant through and through. Goodly amounts of traditional mixed in with old gospel favorites with plenty of picking n grinning. I like to play it at max volume on my Harley Ultra Classic to compete with the boom boom boom next to me. :-)Seriously, if you like blue grass, you need to have this in your collection. ""In the Pines"" is sweet and sorrowful at the same time. Special guest Emmylou Harris sings ""Satan's Jeweled Crown"" to a perfect accompaniment. The harmonies in ""Were you there when they crucified my Lord"" and many of the others will turn your CD player green. By far one of my favorite live albums."
1,Disappointing mush from two greats,"Harman is unclear. Thomson, in her half of the book, writes that she cannot understand him. As best I can tell, he's saying that moral debate is just a power struggle. That's what he's got to say in order to uphold his view that moral judgments are just emotings devoid of truth value. Of course, if you believe something false, you'll probably have to strain to accept other false things, too, but if you write unclearly enough, so that even your coauthor admittedly cannot understand you, perhaps you can hide your false beliefs from view. For her part Thomson says that after the book was commissioned, she realized that what she was going to write was false, but, since it was too late by then, she'd tell it to us anyway. The whole thing is unconscienable. There are so many bad philosophers around that, if the good ones go bad, we'll be in deep trouble."
4,"Simple, repetitive, but very addicting!!","I've owned just about every game console made and go through many games. But, for some reason, this technologically archaic game is my favorite of all time. I'd give it 5 stars, but the graphics and loading times are very substandard. Playing without any cheats makes this game extremely challenging and will eat up many, many hours. But using some cheats can be fun and also make this a total destruction of the enemy type of game (and still can take hours). Many scenarios, good intensity as you progress, and need for strategy to succeed earns this game 4 stars. Graphics and slow processing keeps the fifth star out. Great game!!"
1,Ancor 220020 Marine Grade Electrical Twin Kit Electrical Repair Kit with Strip/Crimp Tool (225-Piece) (225-Pack),Ancor 220020 Marine Grade Electrical Twin Kit Electrical Repair Kit with Strip/Crimp Tool (225-Piece) (225-Pack) This is a substandard product no where near the quality of Anchor products in West Marine. I was very disappointed by the pile of blue scotch locks that are worth less as a wiring repair. They are NOT Marine grade at all. I should have known by the price it was cheap junk. I would have sent it back but my wife had surgery that week and I used some of the products and the tool. Never again! 225 pieces that maybe half will work out if you are carefull
2,Marine Electrical Kit,"At first sight the kit looked good, until you opened it, the parts provided were okay however the razor thin packaging which was expected to hold the heat shrink pieces was pathetic. It practically fell apart in my hands. I expected better from Ancor."
2,Not anchor marine grade connectors,Connectors do not say anchor marine grade on them like they should. And for that matter they don't even look like the anchor connectors you would get from the store.
4,Connector kit.,Good. Great to keep on the boat. Crimper tool is only basic but none have come loose yet.
4,Excellent !,"This bio of Montgomery Clift is the most thorough and fleshed-out bio I have read about him. Ms. Bosworth included all the principal people in Montgomery Clift's life. Facts were checked and researched; if there was a conflict, Ms Bosworth told us both sides of the story.Montgomery Clift is my all-time favorite actor. His acting talent was as high and his personal failings were low......Although his life ended early and somewhat tragically, nothing can diminish his performances !I can recommend this book to all that enjoy celebrity bios."
4,What a Tortured Man,I always admired Mr. Clift's work and wanted to know more about him. He certainly had one of the most bizare upbringings I've ever read about and had a mother who was truly toxic. How anyone could drink and drug as much as he did and have any career at all is an amazing accomplishment. It is too bad he died young but not surprizing given his lifestyle. It is a some what depressing story but well researched since most of his close friends outlived him and are frequently quoted.
4,Insightful,This book provides one of the most thorough biographies I have read about any movie star. The author takes you into the most pivotal moments in Clift's life and leaves you feeling like he was someone you knew greatly.
5,A wonderful selection of Armenian Songs,"My twins just loved this cd. It is very dificult to find an Armenian musci cd that is as well done as this. Wonderful lyrics, easy to listen to and my kids love it. Highly recomend."
1,Successful Franchising,Still have not received the book and have been waiting weeks.Where is it Amazon & how long do I have to wait before it arrives?
3,Practical tips - some very useful,"Please let this author teach you - without starting to praying to him. His insight is clear, his mission fairly clear - to help small businesses do what many growth entrepreneurs have long been doing; actively caretaking the responsibility of being a business owner in the community. I wish that Brad will let a christian co-author a book with him about the importance of giving - when & while being a business owner."
5,Every Day Is Saturday,This book should be read by all approaching or enjoying retirement. As a retiree I enjoyed the many tips on how to improve your retirement. Their approach to a Christian retirement was excellenr.
4,Adequate,"You can learn E&M for the first time only once. I took my first course on E&M in the Physics department. We used the book by Purcell. It was intuitive, visual, engaging almost poetry. Then I took my next semester in the Electrical Engineering department. We used Hayt. It was mundane, pedestrian, just the facts madam. And yet I learned from it. Since then I've picked up half a dozen introductory E&M texts. But I go back to Purcell for understanding and Hayt for engineering help. But I've looked at those other books and I don't think any of them would have been any better. So that earns Hayt a solid 3 stars. All these books discuss skin effect, but only Hayt discusses the effect of skin depth on inductance. For that, it gets an extra star."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"I'm an EE undergrad student and I have to struggle to use this book on a weekly basis. This book lacks sufficient examples, doesn't clearly derive the equations it uses, and worst of all uses TERRIBLE wording in explaining concepts, typically making them more complicated than they already are.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK! ""Oh well I have to, for my class."" No, you don't. Get the homework problems from a friend or Google Books. Then do yourself a favor and buy the book by Ida, that book is fantastic. It explains things clearly, telling you why certain methods are preferred, and it has examples that cover different parts of each concept.Worst book ever."
1,"Awful, just plain awful.","I find this to be a very interesting course, but it is made quite difficult by a single small problem: It is very hard to get an understanding of a field which is built upon a solid foundation of mathematics when the book you're using skips over this most crucial aspect.It is great that I have answers to the odd problems and the in section examples, but with no work to guide me I am left frustrated and exhausted. Combined with 4 other classes, this leads to a tough time trying to figure out even simple concepts.Find a better book unless you already have a thorough understanding of this material, you will NOT regret it."
2,About the worst book on the subject!!,"I have more than 5 books on this subject. I am a self studier, I read a few books on each topic. I never found any useful information from this book. This book don't seemed to go into detail of each subject, just give the formulas. If you use it in school, good luck!! If you study on your own like me, get some other books like Cheng's."
1,"Incomplete, vague and all-around horrible.","This book was chosen arbitrarily by our EE professor for Electricity and Magnetism. This book is absolutely horrible. Rather than rant, I will simply provide a list.1) Many of the examples are lacking in explanation, so if you end up with an answer different than the one indicated, you'll be left questioning your mathematical foundation. this leads me to my next problem...2) Some of the solutions to the examples and problems are just plain incorrect.3) Despite all the equations the book contains, it will be clear once you start doing the chapter review problems that there is a large amount of information missing from the text.4) The provided CD containing some visual examples does not fill the void left by the textbook.This is hands-down one of the WORST textbooks I have ever purchased. The number of mistakes contained in such a late-edition text is appalling. You would be wise to find an alternative."
1,Horrible Textbook,I checked this out of the library because it was a suggested supplement for my EM course. After reading the first chapter I gave up even trying to understand it.If you want a really good EM textbook get Intro. to Electrodynamics by David Griffiths.
1,Are You Kidding Me?,This is the worst textbook I have ever used is any class. The coverage of the topic is unclear and the practice questions are poorly worded. I can only hope that my school will find another text for teaching this subject.
2,Was not pleased with amazon on my first order,"I ordered this book believing like many that I am getting a brand new book, shrink-wrapped and all. I WAS WRONG! I opened the box and there was no shrink wrap, the front and back covers had wear, scratches, and nicks. If I pay full price for a new book, I want a NEW book. (Opinion may change if the second, free order is in better condition). Also spent over 30 minutes trying to contact amazon on the phone before I could get someone that spoke any form of english I understood or someone that didnt ask me to repeat myself 5 times, took 3 tries. STOP THE OUTSOURCING!!!"
1,Product description inaccurate,The online product description lists the only ingredient as 100% natural cherries. I ordered the product and discovered that it also contains sugar and sunflower oil. Buyer beware! A better cherry choice is Melissa's dried cherries - they do not contain any added sugar or oil.
5,Exercise DVD,All of Michelle Dozois's DVDs are great! This one is a weight training/strength training DVD. Her Cardio DVDs are high intensity and are great for medium-advanced exercisers--this one is particularly intense! A great workout.
4,"Easy to understand, 3D chemistry book","There are a lots pictures in the book, and explain theories very well. However, solutions for problems are not in this book, have to buy seperately."
4,Just like any other chemistry book...,There's a lot of writing which is harder for me to understand when we're supposed to be learning how to do equations and reactions-- it gets a little wordy. I guess the book is just like any other chem book.
4,Container Gardening,"This is THE book for apartment-condo dwellers and gardeners who need to know EVERYTHING about planting in a pot! The garden directions explain how to, when to, what to plant and in what kind of outdoor conditions. (shade, sun, cold, hot, dry soil etc.)Individual plants are carefully discussed.Good color pictures as well. It would be hard to be black-thumb gardener using this book."
4,The Complete Container Garden,"Very helpful book for container gardeners or ""wannabes""! Photos are wonderful and instructions easy to follow."
5,"A Comprehensive, Engaging Work","If you are seriously interested in understanding the current theological diversity within Christianity and how it came to be, then this book is for you. Grenz and Olson diligently present the major theological ideas that have shaped theological discourse for the past one hundred years. The book provides a detailed survey of the ideas put forth by the great theologians of the past century and the movements that they founded: Neo-Orthodoxy, Existential Theology, Secular Theology, Process Theology, Liberation Movements, Neo-Catholicism, and American Evangelicalism. The ""critical evaluations"" of various theologians often reflect the authors' personal biases, but on the whole, this book is a very fair presentation of the many ways in which Christianity has attempted to speak to the modern world."
4,Excellent,"This is a sympathetic survery of 20th Century theology with a critical edge, which for its size is remarkably comprehensive. In their treatment of major theologians the authors weave together biographical detail with ideational exposition to make it an interesting and engrossing read (at least for those who enjoy theology!). An ideal introduction to this century's main theological currents. I wish though they could've have included a treatment of Hans Urs von Balthasar."
1,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware. I just purchased the upgrade and when it did not come with the manual, I spent over an hour on the phone with Apple, was transferred a number of times and each person I spoke with said the same thing. If you want a hard copy, print it out.Seriously, the manual is over 1200 pages. It's pretty sad that this is what Apple calls 'support' for their ""professional"" applications."
2,Ballport,"Light, easy to use but flimsy construction. Easy to construct. Should last if treated with TLC. Certainly worth the price, though."
2,Not what i expected,"Maybe it's somethin with my headlight lenses, but these did not look blue to me, at all. I bought some white fog lights, and THEY were bluer than these bulbs. I was"" hella"" disappointed."
5,Another Summer,"I really loved the stories within the story, meaning all the characters whose lives are touched while living in theis wonderful home by the beach."
1,THIS CD IS FOR RETARDS.,"only people that are challenged in knowing what music is talented and good like this. If you're a retard into the most stupid music, this album is for you! every other lyric is an ""f**k!"" and ""s**t"", clearly stating that this band has a low iq and can't come up with good lyrics other than obsenities (oooh how cool and HARD!). This is just pure and simple, SH!T!!!"
3,not bad,After seeing Primer 55 at Ozzfest I must agree that they have much energy live. Naturally I went out within a few days and bought the album. welllllll.....still not quite what it was live. But it isn't bad by any means. Tripinthehead and Loose are my fav tracks.Not bad....but not great. If you're looking for Rap/Rock at it's finest hour check out HED instead.
2,booooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiinnng!!!!,"This is just another boring 'nu-metal by numbers' album. The first track 'Loose' isn't bad, sounding like a combination of Soulfy and Limp Bizkit. But after that it doesn't necessarily go downhill, it just doesn't change and nothing interesting happens. If you like music that doesn't offer any suprises, doesn't stray from the nu-metal rulebook and isn't very interesting then put this at the top of your list."
3,"A decent CD, but I have a couple of quick things to say...","This album is pretty good, I saw them live, and they were alright. Now, I understand the comparisons of this band to Korn or Limp Bizkit, but the Deftones are nothing like these horrible rap-metal bands. The 'Tones are in a league of their own, shared only by bands like Far or Will Haven. Stop comparing Primer55 to the Deftones."
1,Terrible,"Whats all the hype about this band/CD ""Primer 55-Intro. to Mayhem""?. I bought it thinking it would be good, and it was the worst CD i ever bought. They try to sound like a hardcore/rapcore band but it's whack. Try listening to Vision of Disorder, Adamantium, Spitfire, Earth Crisis, or Training For Utopia if you want some good heavy hardcore. Not this CD. Do not buy this CD, you'll be sorry. Every song sounds the same. No talent what-so-ever. The lyrics are in the same monotone voice throughout the entire CD. They use the same distortion on every song. It's very boring to hear. It's torture music."
4,"Not fantastic, but still good","Let me just first say that there are some albums in which it is always the right time to listen to them. Introduction to Mayhem is definitely not one of them. this does not mean that it is a bad cd. I find the best time for this one is when i am in the weight room and need to get hyped up. J-Sins vocals are basically non stop screaming, but the energy behind Primer 55 is definitely their strongest point. At times the songs seem to be kind of redundant, but i still cant keep from listening to this album on a regular basis. I hope that they will make some connections with other bands while on the Ozzfest tour and maybe their sophomore album will feature other acts and they will grow in their music. As for now my favorite tracks are #9-Set It Off (feat MCUD of (hed)pe, #11-Intro to Mayhem, and #12-Dose. I really cant speak for others, so you must check it out for yourself."
3,That Shut Me Up!,"Well, I have to admit, when I first heard this band I thought they were a Joke! I really hated it! I forsaw the next Limp Bizkit! But that was until February 12, 2000, When I saw these guys open for the Thrash Metal GODS, Machine Head. They gave a totaly KILLER Live show! I talked to the singer right after the set and told him that he had just made a fan out of me! He was really happy to hear that. The album is pretty good, I've heard all of it but I don't own it yet. My advice is that if you don't like it, give it a second chance"
5,These guys are sweeet YO!,"Buy this albulm! It is sooo cool, and why do you people say it sounds like limp biz. and korn? it sounds nothing like them, for one, limp bizkit sucks!If you like these guys, check out Reveille"
2,Don't buy it,"All the songs sound the same. Once you've heard Loose, you've pretty well heard the whole album."
5,Mystery and Hope,"T.R. Pearson captures people, moods, and locations like no one else in contemporary fiction. With an intriguing narrative structure that carries the reader along, the author works magic in what is said and left unsaid. By turns hilarious and heartbreaking, this book--as is typical of T.R. Pearson's work--cries out to be read aloud. Highly recommended."
2,Averate at Best,"Cannot see how others have rated this book as ""brilliantly insightful"" or a ""wholly enjoyable tale."" I found it overworked, repetitive and not much more than a 2-hour airplane read. Not a book I will keep or read again."
2,I finally skipped to the end,"It could be I'm not sophisticated enough to have enjoyed this book - half of it, anyway. At times I was caught up in the story and flowed along in it, but more often I felt it was about putting out a great sentence. It made me wonder if writing is like acting - you shouldn't be thinking about the person acting, but rather the character portrayed. I was picturing Pearson smiling with his choice of phrases (and many made me smile too) and otherwise working the words, but is that supposed to happen? The length of the sentences, sometimes repetitive, eventually made me want to skip over them. Like ""enough already!"""
2,not my cup of tea,"At first I was a little intrigued by the many detours that what I thought was the central story took. Soon I came to realize that there is really no central story. This is a trail head with many different possibilities. After a while, I just couldn't keep up. The story line was dispersed and many of the characters were so black and white that I lost interest."
4,Irreverent and irresistible!,"T.R Pearson is a great author! He is both irreverent and irresistible! He captures the wit and wisdom of the true South with his exquisite satire and stunning colloquialisms. What happens when you put together a small town deputy, a child that vanishes and a ""white-trash"" porno addicted man who becomes an oracle of misplaced information and advice? It is nothing that you may imagine! Pearson takes you on an unbelievable jourrney that is both funny and heart touching, about life in a small Southern town, dysfunctional families and a search for innocence in a wonderful style all his own with an ending that will take you by surprise."
3,Marvelously written - but the story...,It was great fun to read. Pearson's deft language and its comic connection with character development made for one funny scene after another. His narrative voice is terrific. But I found the story uninvolving and sluggish. I didn't buy the clairvoyance nor the final resolution of the missing person story. Pearson here seems far more interested in the moment by moment writing than in the plot. This caused much of my goodwill to drain and I was glad the book was over - though I did finish it. I often don't.The T.R. Pearson book to read is Blue Ridge. It has stylistic sharpness AND an excellent suspenseful story.
5,"Awson Lyrics, Beutiful Metophors (An Enjoyable Experience!)",Smokey once again comes to us with an array of beutiful metephores to lead us down a road filled with emotion. A must for those who love beutiful music and lyrics with a message.
5,One Of The Best Ballad Albums Period!!!,"Smokey came correct on this album. I,m feelin this album as I,m writing this review. From Quiet Storm through Coincidentally this album is bomb. Simply put this is one of the baddest albums PERIOD!"
4,Smooth Smokey,"Smokey Robinson left the Miracles in 1972 and released two albums that were not bad, but not up to the high standards he set. On Quiet Storm, he came roaring back with a smooth soul classic. Taking a page from his good friend Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On, Quiet Storm is an album of sensual love songs. Unlike that album which has Mr. Gaye searching for sexual & spiritual salvation, Mr. Robinson sings about both sides of an adult relationship. The songs deal with love, pain, revenge, marriage and the like set against silky smooth beats. A great album to throw on and share with someone special."
5,Oldies,I am of the vinyl population. Didn't think I would find this album on a CD. Brings back many pleasant memories.
5,Simple and beautiful,"I got this set because of the price and style. I just received them today and they are beautiful. They're simple. The price, style and quality are wonderful. I would definitely recommend this set to everyone."
3,"Nice, not great","Very attractive, shiny, pretty pattern, but more lightweight than I am used to. Thought they would be larger and heavier. They'll do me a few years, then I will definitely sample in a store before purchasing."
5,Great Mind Stimulation!,"These are an amazing building set and will keep your kids busy for hours. My six year old boy is not nearly as interested as my 8 year old boy. My 8 year old can sit for a long time making castles, bridges and all kinds of cool stuff. Very worth the money for kids that love to create, and love other kinds of building sets like K'nex and legos!"
1,Unmitigated rubbish,"Yet another piece of excruciating nonsense from George Alexander, aka Rising Sun Productions, aka Y. Ishimoto, aka Yamato productions, aka Damien Chambers. Could be used by a junior high school video production class as an example of what not to do, technically, artistically, and ethically. Production, presentation, script, and content values are zero. Stay away from anything by this company!"
3,Pretty but long and easily tangled,"I bought this necklace because I wanted an interesting pearl necklace to wear with business clothes. This necklace is attractive and the pearl colors match many items in my wardrobe. However, I find that I don't wear this necklace as often as I'd anticipated wearing it because the longest pearls are a bit too long for me so they end up getting stuck down the front of my V-neck tops (most of my tops are V-neck, another reason I went with this necklace style instead of a more traditional string of pearls). Also, the dangling pearl strings get tangled easily so I have to be conscious of unwinding them throughout the day. The quality seems reasonable although I would have preferred the chains to be a little bit fancier looking (such as smaller links and shinier). Ultimately, this is a nice necklace but I don't get as much use out of this necklace as I'd expected for the price so I'm giving it 3 stars."
3,"Good product, but poor finish.","I looked at a few different companies and decided to go with Go Rhino. The Dominator II appears to be made well, but falls short on the finish. I purchased mine in a black finish. Out of the box the paint was chipped. This is the leading cause of nerf bar rust issues. The paint chips and the rust starts. A year down the road and the bar are done. I took mine to Line-X and had them sprayed and rust proofed. In conclusion, Bars good, Finish bad."
4,Nifty Lens Adapter for the Canon PowerShot G1,"This is the lens adapter for the new Canon PowerShot G1. When you attach the LA-DC58 to your digicam, it converts the lens to 58mm and allows you to attach a variety of accessories, namely Canon's ""Wide Angle Lens"", ""Close up Lens (Macro)"", and ""Tele Converter Lens"" all for the G1. With the adapter the lens also accepts many other 58mm goodies, including the dozens of 58mm filters you see on Amazon.com, so you can still use polarizers, UV lens protectors, etc.My only complaint about the LA-DC58 is that since it widens the diameter of the lens, it partially obstructs the view of the AutoFocus assist light (for low-light conditions) and the G1 microphone.Other than that, the LA-DC58 is a nice add-on for the Canon PowerShot G1!"
1,This dont work with G3,I bought this accesory thinking that it was compatible with the Canon powershot G3 (because it is in the list of accesories for this camera) but it doesnt work with the G3. Buyers beware. If you have a G3 you should buy a LA-DC58B instead.
2,My [two cents worth],"I have this adapter just in the need that I want to use the special effect filters.. it serves this purpose very well, however, I've also noticed some drawbacks that annoy me quite often.a) it blocks the build-in flash if you don't zoom in.b) it blocks the low-light focus-assistant beam!! and for my G2, although it is a Canon Type-A camera, the red-light focus-assitant beam of the external flash Speedlite 420EX won't work. That said, you are taking risks on using autofocus, and if you are using those converters, say bye bye to autofocus.c) my silver G2 looks bad with this BLACK adaptor..."
4,Good one!,"A great clock for telling the day of the week, but how do you reset it for Daylight Savings Time?"
1,Very poor quality,I bought one clock and one column of the LEDs did not light up. I returned that and ordered a 2nd. It is even worse! There are several columns that don't light up. Two strikes and this clock is out!
1,poor quality,after a short period the xx:ox number does not light up. This is very confusing for someone with dementia trying to figure out the time.
3,digital day/date clock for elderly mom,"I bought 2 of these clocks for my mom who has dementia and can't keep track of the day, date, time or whether it's AM or PM. The positive: large, well lit day, date and time. The negative: AM and PM indicators are too small, not well lit and not noticeable enough. I had to cut out stickers in the shapes of AM and PM and put them on the clocks."
2,clock,"Bought this clock for my mom, her eye sight and memory are not so good. She had a hard time reading the clock because of the intensely bright numbers and letters, she also had a problem with the red dots which make up the numbers and letters, if she was six feet away the dots seemed to throw her off, to much space in between them I guess..needs a dimmer and maybe an amber or muted white color for the lights...."
5,Excellent Item,"This product is definitely worth the price. It comes extremely well packaged and arrived in excellent condition. The included instructions were easy to follow if read carefully. The display shows as large red letters and numbers that are very easy to read, even for people with poor eyesight. The only possible problem I found is that it's depth, not mentioned in the description, is only about 2 inches. The clock is described as a wall clock, but could be used standing on a surface. It seems stable when sitting on a table, but also seems like it could very easily tip over in some situations. Overall I am very happy with the product. I got it because I was most interested in it's showing the day of the week in the display. This is especially valuable for people with memory problems and their care-givers."
1,Partly defective,"Was hoping to use this product for an elderly person. Top row with time would not display. Day, month and date on the bottom row displayed fine and were able to be programmed. Box looked like it had been opened before and taped shut. We returned the product."
2,Never Worked,"Right out of the box, the clock never worked. The whole screen looks like something out of the matrix, with just rolling pixels. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone."
5,Best visual clock!,"This clock is very clear (gives off a red glow in the dark). My Dad is older and has trouble remembering what day it is. LOVE that this clearly gives the day of the week and the date -- without a bunch of garbage (temperature, etc.). Perfect for our use."
5,Excellent - excellent - excellent!,"This clock had to be the very best aid (after a walker) that I could have purchased for my Mom as she reaches her 84th birthday. Several days went by when she could not remember what day it was and she was thinking that she was ""losing her mind."" I began a search for a clock that was large enough for her to see from her easy chair and that contained the day and date. The only place I could find this clock online was Amazon. Other sites had clocks but the words and date were too small for an older person to see. Needless to say, you have two happy customers! Also, I have told so many people about this purchase this past month, I feel like I am a big promoter of Amazon."
4,Very nice,"As everyone mentioned, this is great not only for the elderly but perhaps for a business--so customer's can clearly see the time and date.I only had two issues with it (one of which made me return it). The first was the unnecessary leading zero in the hours digit, it makes it difficult to read the time quickly sometimes. The second was the AC wall wart adapter got a little uncomfortably hot after being used for a couple of hours."
5,Wonderful Clock,"My brother and I bought this clock for my 90 years old mother who has dementia. The only way she would know the day and date was to look at the newspaper. It took my mom about a week to get used to this clock. After that she really liked it. The clock is bright and will light up a room at night. It beats using a night light. One of the things I like best about this clock is that if you unplug it or have power failure, when the power is back on or you plug it in, it has the correct time. However, if you should have to correct the time, it's very simple to set this clock. When I ordered this clock from Amazon, it was delivered really fast. This clock was pricey, but I think it's worth it."
5,Just the thing for older people,Got this for my elderly mother. She could not see the numbers on standard sized digital clocks. Great product.
2,"Oversized is right, red numbers too bright",This is the clock I bought for my mother who is 94 to have by her pill box. She kept putting it by the door and I kept finding a new place to try it. It's just sooo big it's hard to find a place in an average home. It would be okay in a nursing home or public place. After I tried it in three different rooms my mother finally said she didn't like the red letters and numbers. Once I found the cheap one for $11.18 (Geneva Clock Co 4248 Elgin Alarm Clock) I packed this one up.
2,Defective clock,The clock is just what I was looking for but it came to me defective I sent it back they did not look at the entire complaint said I was setting it wrong and sent it back after having it for a month but neglected to repair the dim LED light.So avoid this outfit
5,A great clock for the elderly.,"We bought this clock with time, day and date for my mother-in-law who had hip surgery and was in a Rehab location. She had a very hard time knowing what time it was, was the date was and what day it was. The elderly have a hard time coming out of anesthesia (she had hip replacement at 82 years of age) and sometimes takes months to ""clear the fog"".We mounted this clock on the wall across from her bed and she loved it. We now have her at home with us and it is mounted on the wall beside her bed. She says it is not too bright for night time so it doesn't disturb her sleep. This product has fulfilled her needs to a tee.Thank you so much for the opportunity to praise this produce and hope it helps other people like it has helped her."
5,Oversized LED Clock,"Purchased for my father living in a nursing home. He is well pleased with the clock and it allowing him to also know the day, and date.The clock will keep the time and date settings even when unplugged (as often happens in nursing home settings)One bad thing: This clock allows the patient to time how quickly the nursing staff responds to a call for help.Highly recommend this clock. Very good value."
3,BIG digital clock,"Amazingly quick service. We bought this clock for my mother-in-law who has trouble remembering the day of the week. It was ordered on Tuesday PM and was delivered on Thursday!If you don't want a BIG clock don't order this one. It's really large for home use. I would like to have found a smaller one but this was the only one we found with a clear alpha day(MON) and month(OCT) display.Also, the package came with no paperwork whatsoever, no warranty information or instructions on how to set it. Fortunately it was fairly easy to figure out.If you want a LARGE clock with clear simple display, this is a good choice. If you want something small and stylish, pick something else."
2,had to return it,"The size is huge, altho' the tech specs say that, but the brilliance of the red light is too much. I wish there was a switch to lower the intensity a lot. We bought this for an altzheimers patient but the incredible red lights are way too bright at night. We are looking hard to try to find a non-lit clock that shows the month and calendar day in real words, January 18, not 1/18, because altzheimers leads to numbers running together without meaning. ALso, the patient grew up in a non-digital era. This simple of an idea is apparently beyond attainment. The ALZstore.com advertises a black letters on white background one for about $100 which is perfect but it seems to be permanently out of stock. Anyway this particular clock is too attention-grabbing and overwhelming. I doubt anyone out there could sleep with the perpetual red display on. Please, include a knob to turn it down at night !"
4,Large numbered Clock,"We got this Big Digital LED Calendar clock for our mother who is almost blind, she sees only shadows. Sadly, She could not see this clock. It is the clearest and largest view of numbers we've seen. Wish we had known about it some time ago when she might have been able to see it. Lovely clock! This clock plugs in and has no battery back up to save the settings if power fails."
4,"good product, minor drawbacks","Loved the size and brightness. The only suggestions would be: 1. make the month, date and day the same size as the time; 2. the digital zero is often mistaken as an eight; 3. (and the most important) light the words am/pm instead of a lighted dot."
5,"very helpful ""tool""",A very useful addition to my elderly aunt's room in a skilled care facilty. The staff at the facilty think it is extremely helpful to her.
4,Great purchase!,"We purchased this clock for my mother-in-law who is suffering from early signs of dimentia. She couldn't keep up with the day of the week, month, etc. We looked at many clocks online and found this one to be a great price at Amazon, compared to the same clock at other sites. We did have to send the first one back because a bulb burned out shortly after receiving it. We had no problem with the return and received a replacement very quickly. My mother-in-law did have to get used to the bright light of the clock on her wall and at first wanted to unplug it at bedtime, but within a short time, she came to depend on it and now leaves it on all the time. She's had it for almost a year now and she can quickly refer to the clock when wondering what day, month, time, etc. it is. We are very pleased with this purchase."
5,Huge Clock,"I bought this clock for our church's sound booth so the musicians and speakers could see the time from the stage, worked perfectly!"
4,Perfect for Mom,"I have been searching for a clock with the day of the week and date for my aging mother. Unfortunately, they all required her to press different buttons to get the date to display. This is too confusing for her. I love the constant, large display that is clear and easy for Mom. Although it is called a wall clock, the thickness allows it to be displayed on a table or shelf too."
4,"Tells the the time and, more importantly, the date and day!","It's large. Large with huge flashing red numbers. But if that's what older folks need to see the time clearly and confirm what day it is, then that's what they need! And this contraption does the job."
1,Clock Arrived Broken,"This large clock was supposed to be a gift for my parents and instead it had to be returned. I opened the clock and set it at around 9:50 in the morning and was going to gift wrap it. It looked impressive and my husband commented that it looked like a mini ""shot clock."" Well, I got distracted and it hit 10:05 before I started wrapping it; unfortunately 10:05 appeared on the clock as 0:05. The first numeral setting was broke. I was glad at least that my parents didn't open up a broken present. To make matters worse, the second gift I purchased for them in this same order (a MedCenter Alarm Clock) was also broken. A quick ride to the store and my parents received a gift card instead! Based upon my experience with the quality and packaging of this item, coupled with the high price, I would not recommend it."
3,Neon sign impact,"My mother, 91 years old, and I liked the large size which could be read from anywhere in the room, but the impact of the vivid contrast between the black and red was hard to look at in a small room. At night the red light lit up the whole room. We returned it."
5,great gift,This clock was a great gift for a friend with dementia. He uses it everyday to check the date and time. It arrived very quickly and works great. I highly recommend it.
4,My Mom's new clock,"My 88 year old Mother (who still lives independently in her home) commented that the digital calendar clock was the best thing she has in her house! Believe me, that is a compliment because she certainly has a LOT of things in her house. (67 years of accumulation). She says she will never understand how she managed without it. She truly loves her new clock."
1,Broken,"Recieved the product and could not get the product to work. It was a waste of my time, and my $ was tied up for quite some weeks. First purchase, bad experience, probably my LAST experience!Thanks,Brad"
5,Excellent clock calendar,Excellent product. 93yo mother can't remember the day of week or date. She also can't see bedroom clock at night. This Dynamic Living clock is in her bedroom and she can easily see the time. Every day she knows the day and date. Clock keeps data with power loss so she doesn't have to do anything. Perfect for persons with memory and vision problems.
1,What is taking soooooooo long for the item to ship?????,"I have no idea what to say about the item because I have yet to get my hands on it, it's been in my ""waiting to ship"" area on Amazon and I placed the order like three days ago!!!!!!! What's the hold up???!!!!!! PLEASE ship the thing already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Works great... With The Lights Off,"In normal room light you can hardly see the characters. The characters all look like ""8s"". It's great in the dark however."
3,Useful but pricey,"Three weeks ago, I bought this clock for my dad who recently suffered from a major stroke. I wanted him to know what time, date & day of the week it is so he'll be in touch with the real world. The clock definitely serves the purpose why I bought it and the numbers are big & clear so he can read it very well. It's very good for people with disabilities. However, it is cumbersome to set up because if you disconnect the power plug, you have to start programming all over again, step by step, one by one...press the year then hour, minutes, month and date. There is no short cut way. It is also very pricey at $100 and it doesn't come with a radio. I feel the reasonable price should be at $25-$35. My dad insisted that it has to have a radio because he said it was too expensive just to be a clock!"
4,Great Time and DATE clock!,"I purchased this clock for my senior mom (89) who has hada little problem with remembering what day it is. It worksgreat. I am very pleased. Having the time is good, butthe Day and Date is excellent! It's thin so it can hangon the wall or put it a shelf or table by the wall-Very easy to read too! Large lettering!I would recommend it for anyone needing to keep track ofthe days- particularly for our senior friends and family!Only one problem- I wish it had a battery back up."
4,A little extra makes a difference,"I purchased this clock in April 2011. It is terrific still going strong. Plastic tint film tamed the LED's brightness. Top choice in my selections.Dynamic Living Oversized 16-inch X 7.5-inch Digital Led Calendar Wall ClockSpent to much time looking for a digital clock with a digital day month date calendar. This clock fit the bill although I read it was very bright. And it is.To tame it down I ordered the plastic tint film: Sunshine Kids Cool Shade For Car Window, Black which came in 2 small size rolls and was static cling (no adhesive). (from Amazon under $4.00) Simple to cover the clock's flat face.Clock is large 16x7 but not obnoxious.With the film the led's are clearly visible and brightness is gone.I see the same clock around the NET at different prices. Amazon had the best. having Prime delivery makes ordering so easy since big items still with prime and not commercial shipping rates.I'd recommend this clock/calendar"
1,Digital Clock,"Installed this clock to replace an old worn out analog clock in our Sheet Metal Shop. The addition of Date and Day is an added plus. Easy setup and install.Can easily be seen from across the room. Finding plug in clocks that don't run on batteries was difficult, and analog are a thing of the past. This was a good clock at a fair price.EDIT:------problem with clock.What a surprise, Monday morning after I wrote the review over the weekend, the clock was blank. It was used about 25-30 days. I have contacted Amazon and UPS is scheduled to pickup and return the clock. I am very disappointed, trying to find a clock that does not run on batteries is proving to be difficult."
4,Great clock,"I purchased this clock about 6 months ago for my in-laws. He is almost blind, and she has Alzheimers, so the large numbers, as well as the day and date are very helpful to them."
5,great large LED clock!,"got this for the office so everyone can see the big numbers to tell the time, and since i'm not a big fan of regular clocks i got this one instead, reason being the regular clock with the big & small hands tend to make a annoying noise every time the second is moved. plus this LED clock is visible in dark rooms when there's a presentation is being watched and all the lights are out."
3,5 minutes of comfort,"I don't blame the ice bandana. My ideal temperature for gardening, carpentry, even a stroll, is 60 degrees. Otherwise I am one of those people who sweat. It pours off my face, stinging my eyes and irritating my skin. I go through a couple of kitchen towels wiping the stuff off my face and they end up wet; not damp... Wet.So I slip this little otter-pop in a sock around my neck and a feeling of cool relief is immediate--- but only for about 5 minutes. But I am an extreme case. Others have reported better results and I believe them. Just know that if you sweat like a roasting goose drips fat, it might be better to stuff a nylon jacket full of blue ice and wrap that around your suffering self.On the other hand, it is easy to slip the newly refrozen flexible ice pack back into the very well made product. On the negative side, it is a bit too large. My neck is 15.5 inches. There should be some kind of Velcro system to allow the ends to overlap."
3,sized for men,"This product is really sized for men, I have found it is too big to fit properly around my neck. The cooling factor is subtle (probably from being sized too large) but it does help. I strongly recommend getting the replacement packs, as you will need to replace the pack if you intend to use this for long periods of time."
3,ok product,It didnt stay tied very well and the ice melted very quick in 95 degree weather. I am not sure if I would recommend this product. Maybe I will try to use it again.
1,Ice Bandana,First of all does not keep my wife cool for she is a crossing guard work outside. She says i never felt cool.The worse product
4,ICE BANDANA,"I have used this on my foot, for broken toe or bones in foot, leg cramps and neck and eyes during a migraine. The ties are a great feature.. Very easy to use."
4,ice bandana,"I RECEIVED MY BANDANA,WELL PACKED. LET IT FREEZE AS WAS MENTIONED. THE BANDANA WORKED GREAT!LASTED FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS IN THIS HEAT OF 90+. I HAVE MS AND THIS BANDANA GAVE ME THE COOLING OF MY NECK AD I FELT BETTER WITH NO PROBLEMS.THANK YOU"
3,Not so great,"I have Multiple Sclerosis and can not get over heated more than a degree or two in the heat. I ahve bought other cooling devices but so far, I am not crazy about this one. It cools but not enough to add comfort to a sweltering day. It may be too much padding on either side that is not allowing teh ice to do it's job."
3,Ice bandana,works fairly well. it tends to want to turn around on your neck so that the ice pack is in the front of your neck instead of the back where it should be. I have had other ones that you wet that seem to make me feel cooler. But I am overall happy with it.
4,"like it, don't love it","I like the bandana but it doesn't stay cold for so long. It seems to help with the heat somewhat, but doesn't make a dramatic difference. Still, doesn't hurt."
2,Did not keep cold!,"I would put it on my neck walk out of the house, and find that it was already not cold, it just can never get very cold, you can leave it in your freezer for days and it still will not get that cold. It did not work that well for me."
1,WASTE OF TIME,Don't waste your time or money on this. Doesn't keep you cool at all. I couldn't even tell I had it on. Get a cooling towel instead.
3,Not a bad read but could have used some better prose,"Though the first person persective is a little lacking, this book opens up the mysteriousness of Atzlan and their practices. The characters are solid and believable and the action is ok. Quite frankly, I only advise those that have read a number of the Shadowrun books to go for this one or you will otherwise have a bit of trouble grasping some situations"
2,Brief Child Therapy Homework Planner,"If you work with underprivileged kids, as I do, you will find this book's exercises very difficult to use. The exercises require sustained attention for reading long passages, and the vocabulary level is extremely high, even for my 7th grade clients. Many exercises require critical thinking and creative writing skills, which my client's have great difficulty with as well. Most inner city kids I work with are performing 2-3 grade levels behind, and look at me like I am crazy when I try to do these exercises with them.This book would work great with middle/upper-middle class kids who are taught verbal skills from the get go."
5,Exceptional,"I find the book,Child Psychotherapy Homeworker Planner written by Arthur E. Jongsma to be reader friendly, very easy to understand, and informative. This book is an exceptional resource for clinicians, teachers, clients and family. I use this book on a daily basis, incorporating each homework assignment into each session and treatment plan. As it relates to defining the appropriate technique to a specific problem area I find it very obliging. As a training clinician, I have found the book to be an effective and efficient tool that I can use in my everyday interaction with children who have childhood disorders. I would recommend that other new or training clinicians use this book as a guide to learn different techniques."
5,Cookbook,I liked this book very much. The family-style recipes are delicious and are very easy to make. I would recommend this book to friends and family.
5,More Bombings and More Deaths,"Tremblay demonstrates without a shadow of a doubt, that this unnecessary war is both illegal and immoral. Now, let's make the media accountable for not reporting the thousands of civilian Iraqi deaths ruthlessly caused by American bombings. The United States is not a force for good in Iraq, it is a force for destruction and killing. The Bush administration has lost any sense of right and wrong. It has become a monster.Give this book to friends and relatives, so they can learn what it is all about."
5,When the Next Judgment at Nuremberg?,"[...] ""The New American Empire"" deals factually with the Iraq war and how the Bush administration has paid scant attention to international and even domestic law. Read this excellent book!"
4,Very good overall analysis of the topic,"This book provides a very good global picture of thetopic of American Empire. This is most useful, giventhere is a plethora of writings on the subject. Theauthor's point of view is most penetrating, especiallyin situating the problem in its geopolitical andhistorical contexts. He deserves particular credit forhis moral/legal analysis. One would have wished,however, a more elaborate conclusion."
2,Could be better,I was disapointed in the musical interpretation used in this disk. The selections are fine but the arrangements could be much better.
2,"Same old songs, poorly performed","This list of songs sounded promising because they are the classic ones you hear at weddings. I will keep searching for better recordings by known orchestras, these are very heavy on the strings and not very good sound. Vegas wedding chapel, maybe. My daughter's wedding, no way."
3,More formal than I expected,"The arrangements of the songs were much more formal than I expected. For example, there was a lot more organ music than I thought there would be. I think I only ended up using one song in my ceremony, but it gave me a good starting points to find different arrangements of songs I liked."
3,"""EastEnders"" is Great Show. Book Offers Strong Background","Being relatively new to folks who populate Albert Square on ""EastEnders,"" this book offered tremendous insight on what I've missed and who's who. It's great for background stuff, particularly on who's related to who and how they've grown since the show premiered. The only drawback is that it was written a few years back. That means some of the current characters are nowhere to be found. But you can't have everything."
5,Pure Gorgeous Guitar,"An amazing album from a consistently amazing player, Thunderation is Dan on 6 and 12 string guitar, with some subtle help from Billy Oskay on violin/viola and synthesizer, Cam Newton on 12 string guitar, and Gregg Williams on midi percussion. The music has a quiet urgency, great as background AND as something to really pay attention to. Mr. Crary is a master, and this is some really beautiful music. He composed most of the tracks, and the ones he didn't are traditional, save for Amsterdance which was composed by Cam. All instrumental, all rich, all amazing. The music is kind of folky, new-agey, but with at times an almost stately...19th-century-clavier-kind-of-feel."
1,Fell apart before it arrived,I was looking for a flexible spatula. This was what I was looking for in length and flexibility but the handles seperated from the spatula before it arrived. Returned it for a refund.
5,cookie spatula is fabulous,"i love this spatula, it slips under cookies without tearing them up. It is good for almost any use getting baked foods from their dishes. This spatula is my favorite!"
5,great spatula for either eggs or cookies!,"This spatula is super thin and gets under eggs in a fry pan. It also gets under those thin crispy cookies that we all love. It works for pancakes, also. I use a cast iron frypan, but if used carefully, it would work for a non-stick pan, too. Love it!!"
4,great for cookies,"I'm very glad I bought this spatula. It works much better for getting cookies off the tray than the normal plastic ones. Its so nice and thin, it can get right under them without crinkling up the cookies or breaking them. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the handle. It's not very comfortable and it feels somewhat cheap, but the product works great and is cheap."
1,Worked until it broke,"This was a replacement for a similar product I had purchased locally. The original one lasted 3 years and then broke. I can live with that. This replacement lasted through about 3 weeks of daily use before it broke. I am seriously disappointed. The spot welds that hold the handle onto the spatula blade are poorly done and let go after very little normal use. If they stayed intact, this would be a good product, but don't waste your money on this spatula."
1,didn't last 3 months,"i'd give it zero stars if i could. bought similar spatula made from a company called ""Endurance"" and lasted over a decade. this one only survived flipping those heavy fried eggs for about 3 months!"
2,Broken,"It worked well up until it broke about two weeks later. It is slightly welded/stamped where the handle meets the spatula. If you look closely at the pic you will see two pock marks where this occurs, I was flipping pancakes, not anything out of the normal use of a spatula, and it broke. I still use the spatula part b/c I paid like $10 for it, but I am mad. I should have known better and bought a more expensive quality made product. I put it in the dishwasher, scraped cast iron, turned pancakes, removed cookies, it worked well until it broke, very disapointed :( My husband thinks he might be able to repair it w/ the proper tools, but that is ridiculous of the company to sell shoddy work."
2,Looks Good but That's About it,"I bought this spatula hoping to replace an old one that looked just like it. Unfortunately you can't tell from the picture that the spatula's blade is slightly curved. This prevents you from sliding under the cookie or egg evenly. If you try to use it as a pie cutter knife as I used to with my old one, it cuts on a curve. After a few months use the handle weld broke and I threw it away. My hope is to find another spatula made in the good old USA."
5,All purpose spatula,We have had one of these spatulas in our kitchen for nearly a decade and cannot live without it! The first one wore out afer about 6 years of daily use when the rivets gave way between handle and blade. We use it for all skillet cooking in addition to baking. Was delighted to find the exact one to replace our original!
4,Flexible,"I haven't used this yet, but bent it forward and back; so far it seems strong yet flexible. I'm planning on using this on omelets and more fragile cookies."
5,Awesome spatula,"Great for taking cookies off the cookie sheet. I used it the other day to hold up the heating element in my oven while trying to scrape overflowing cake off the bottom of the oven. It held up fine, did not warp or lose its shape. It didn't even get discolored. Seriously that is awesome!"
5,Could you find better rock music?,"This CD is killer! I couldn't find better music to play during the morning commute. I can't get enough of it, even after listening to it 100 times over. You'll have to listen to it a lot if you want to get the lyrics down, cause they're fast and furious! If they're not on a radio station near you, call 'em up and ask em why the hell they aren't. These guys are take the country by storm and have no regrets. Look for them on the new Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack too! Get Pimpified today!"
5,The best of 2000,This band is very awsome. They have a different kind of sound with a mix of punk and rock. They are going to be very popular in the next few years.
5,funky jazz rock n roll a little bit of metal rap,"I was really skeptical about buying this CD but man did it turn out to b one of my favorites out of my collection of about 2000. Really good music way b before its time. Where was I & y did it take me so long to find out about the Pimps? Exactly that's what I love about Amazon, finding music that's so good for so little moowla.Thanks Amazon keep em cuming!"
3,nice arm but thread has too much play,The steel arm is made of nice quality except the thread is .010 smaller than it is supposed to be. I had to put thread locker on my threads in my tremolo block to keep the play out of it. other than that I do like the bar
1,Unreliable laptop and the WORST technical service and guarantee,"I bought this laptop a year ago from Circuit City as a present for my husband.In less than a year it had a hard drive and a cd/dvd drive replaced, and the batttery pack, ram, and the OS and programs, removed, and installed over and over again.New year's eve was spent talking to technical service people from India, and Seattle, on the first day of the new year more of the same with India and finally with some Spanish speaking people.Last time I heard from a supervisor of the supervisor that I needed to fax the receipt for the purchase of the laptop in order to bring it to another supervisor to determine what to do. I still have not heard from them.The laptop is an useless paperweight, sad reminder of money, time, and confidence in HP lost.Bottom line, buy MAC."
3,??,This product was a lil strange b/c it worked fine at first but then it damaged a lot of my files so i wasnt sure if it was used too much b-4 i got it but it definitely spends its time in my trash now b/c it was corrupted!these things r never smart to buy used so it was my mistake-- too lazy to buy on in the store i guess
4,Better Than Most,"I have recently tried to give up soda, and am making the effort to Tea. Both lightly sweetened and unsweetened. I have recently tried Honest Tea in there smaller sizes 10oz bottle for $1.25 (the 64 oz is a good deal price wise).I found that the tea is best served very cold but has a little more bitter after taste than other premium teas. I have continued to buy it as it is my second favorite tea in the Unsweetened flavor, but I much prefer the mint flavor."
4,VERY GOOD BUY AND PRODUCT,"I really wanted a good source of anti-oxidants in a green tea without having to constantly brew my own. Honest Tea is the answer. One of our local stores carries this product in the small bottles, but it is no value, very expensive. I did a lot of research to find this product and it is nearly perfect. I actually add a small amount of sugarless bottled lemonade which makes it even better tasting. This is a best buy, especially, if you can find it locally. I have not been able to find the 64 ounce bottles locally which would be the best value."
2,"Great product, Very High Price","I've been drinking Honest Tea for a number of years now. It is an excellent choice for inclusion in a healthy diet. Unfortunately, my local health food store is temporarily out of stock, hence looking for it on Amazon. However, $5.99 per bottle is extremely high. Typical store price is around $3.50. I'll wait."
5,Five stars for the tea itself,"Words cannot even begin to describe my love for this tea. I was looking for an authentic unsweetened tea that contained a substantial amount of antioxidants. This tea was it. It's organic. It has no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. It's Fair Trade Certified. It has a ton of antioxidants. Oh, and did I mention how energized I feel after drinking it? Just Green Tea is the real deal. I lucked out because I live close to a Wegmans, who carries the 64 fluid ounce bottle at a good price. This tea is wonderful for health-conscious folks, those seeking to lose weight, college students who have an 8 A.M. class, and tea connoisseurs. Five stars for the product, one star for the Amazon price."
5,replaceable toothbrush heads,"using a compostable toothbrush by Fuchs, you can change the head every few months as dentists recommend, without adding plastics to the landfill. highly recommended."
2,More of an introduction than a handbook,"OK as a starter, for someone who knows zero about media, but falls short of the mark for anyone who is a practitioner in a media-related industry. The first 100 pages are spent on ""context"" which might be helpful for readers who know nothing about marketing either (Ms. Katz feels it necessary to tell us what the 4Ps are...), but this leaves very little for anyone who actually needs to DO media buying, planning or research."
2,"Quick interesting one-time read, but lacking passion and romance","""Sizzling"" romance? HA! Not so much. This was pretty decent as a suspense book, but definitely isn't romance. Even as a suspense, it felt like so much happened with the killer so quickly, then all of a sudden nothing happened with the killer and the police team figured everything out almost instantly, which just seemed so unrealistic. Also, there just didn't seem to be any passion or feeling behind anything; I wasn't really drawn in to the story and didn't really feel a connection with the characters. An interesting and quick read, but lacking passion and feeling; a good one-time read, but only worth borrowing from the library or a friend, not to buy. For some of my favorites in romantic suspense tryBlue Smokeby Nora Roberts,Storm Force (Silhouette Bombshell)by Meredith Fletcher orThe Maze (FBI Series)by Catherine Coulter."
4,A Good Solid Read,"This is my first Mariah Stewart book and I liked it well enough that I will be diving back in for more. The initial setup of the book was strong and compelling. Stewart's got a talent for solid character interaction. I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed the characters. My only thought is that the conflict was a tad expected. I know this is a suspense, not a mystery, but by not knowing who the villain actually was, put me in a mystery state of mind, then figuring out the why so quickly was a little off for me. Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I look forward to more books my this author."
3,"readable, but disappointing",I bought the series after reading a description in a related article in the Wall Street Journal. I was disappointed. Mystery/suspense element was weak and romance didn't have tension to hold interest. Would rather read something strong on one or the other than weak at both.
3,Mixed Bag,"STORY: 5 Stars - A very good premise and storyline of a woman whose family was murdered 26 years earlier. Now a detective, she faces tracking a killer whose MO is the same as the killer that plagued her town all those years ago. There is no romantic storyline in this book.CHARACTERS: 3 1/2 Stars - Good lead character. Excellent villain. Everyone else is paper-thin.WRITING: 2 Stars - When the author is actually writing the crime portions of the story, it's very good. Unfortunately, she feels the need to go off on unimportant tangents, like taking like 5 pages to describe the preparation and eating of a single meal, or inane discussions about clothes. Worse, the characters' dialog, is pedestrian at best - reads like a high school student wrote the dialog.Worth the read, but be prepared to skip pages.3 Stars overall."
4,My 2nd Mariah Stewart book,"This book was about a girl whose entire family was killed by a homeless guy that the father be-friended. Or was it?Cass Burke is on the trail of a serial killer who targets young white women with long dark hair. During her investigation she uncovers shocking evidence that her own family were among the first victim of the Bayside Strangler. In comes help in the form of an FBI Agent, Rick Cisco who is assigned to assist Cass. Also helping out Rick and Cass are Regan Landry a true-crime reporter and Mitch Peyton an FBI Computer Whiz.Once Cass Burkes starts connecting the past to the present, will the serial killer let her get away like he did 26 years ago?Read the book and find out.I expected a more electrifying conclusion but it was still a good read."
3,First time Japanese teacher,"This book is written completely in Japanese, so you should be 2 kyuu plus or native to order it. The book is good in that it suggests what props to bring, and will tell you how to teach the grammar structures entirely in the target language. However, when it came to teaching verbs, the guide suggested cutting out cards and flashing them to elicit a response from students. I thought the cards might be ok for Japanese language learners in Japan, but odd for students outside Japan who aren't familiar with the illustrations or the symbolisms."
4,Gaye was Good,"This is a good collection, but by no means a complete one. What's here is solid - the best known stuff. This is good Motown crooner stuff. Here are the ones that stand out:Let's Get It On - as close to sensual as a man's voice can getHow Sweet It Is - happy love tuneHeard it through the Grapevine - Marvin's version is teh best version of this songMercy Mercy Me - interesting song. It talks about teh environment, which is cool.Can I Get a Witness - rockin' piano piece"
4,"Greatest hits *without* ""Sexual Healing""? I don't think so!","For what this disc offers it's OK, but it'll never be the ""greatest"" without the above track. But isn't that how it is with all ""greatest hits"" albums? There's always one, dynamite must-have track missing to ensure that you buy the original album ... oh well, ""Let's Get It On"" is still powerful, as is ""What's Going On"" and ""Mercy Mercy Me."" I'm sorry to say that that ""How Sweet It Is"" and ""Heard It It Through the Grapevine"" have been rendered unlistenable due to repeated radio airplay and the oh-so-cute California Raisin ads."
4,Pretty Good,I liked this book more or less. The banter between Cord and Jonty was entertaining; I just wish there were more love scenes.
2,"Ohhh Nooo, Not Again!!!","Norah Hess's characters are sometimes shallow and her plots weak, but there is one thing in her novels that annoys me to no end. That's when she names the heroine's horse (all together now)... BEAUTY!!!Every freakin' horse can't be named Beauty. I was actually be getting into this book until it came to the scene concerning the horse. I found myself holding my breath, praying that she had given Jonty's horse a different name. I know this sounds pretty petty, but this repetitive equine name is driving me crazy.Also, I find it hard to believe that Cord got on Jonty's case for being effiminate, yet he allowed Paunch (a solid gold pervert) continue to chase and harass a supposedly teenaged ""male""."
5,Great!,I use these on my hunting dogs in New Zealand to ensure their stock proof. These work and are simple to use
4,cheaper than roomba & works just fine,"I got a great deal on mine as a today's special value from QVC, and paid only $117 for it. After letting the battery charge overnight, I tried it yesterday and it works just fine, with a remote control and more features than I expected! It doesn't get to the very edges of every nook and cranny, and only works on low pile carpet and hard surface floors, but I am very pleased with how well it navigated on its own and how well it cleaned the floors. The recharge time is much shorter after the initial time. For the impatient there is a rapid recharger available for purchase separately. The debris is collected in a cup you empty after each use, so no bag is required, but the replacement filters are not cheap (about $29 for a dozen from Lentek, $24 from QVC.)"
2,Not good for carpets -- okay for hardwood and linoleum,"I too bought this through QVC for a cheaper price. What caused me to return it is the countless times I ran it over the same area (on 1/2"" carpeting) to pick up things it missed. On smooth surfaces (linoleum) it seemed more effective -- but this wasn't an economical replacement for my $5 Swiffer. Although it was fun to watch as it ran, I had to follow it around because it would get stuck under the couch and in corners (it shuts down after a few attempts to reposition itself). It's a fun novelty item but should not be considered a serious cleaning machine. If you do decide to get this, don't throw out your old vacuum -- you'll need it."
2,Don't bother.,"Thought this item sounded like a good idea. Wrong! Doesn't pick anything up. Not enough suction. Hits a couple of things and shuts off. Save your money, don't bother."
5,Plenty of twists!,"Just when I thought the crew would make it, something else happened! Olson and Ingermanson certainly did their research on what it would take to pull off a manned Mars mission--then thought of every way to break it!Very entertaining with a great cast of characters. I'm anxious to begin the sequel."
3,A Believable Trip to Mars!,"Olson and Ingermanson did their research and they create a realistic setting for this sci-fi thriller. It is a little tough at the beginning because they jump around between character points of view rather quickly, not giving the reader much time to gain sympathy with the heroes of the story. And new characters are introduced at a head-spinning pace. But stick it out for the first hundred pages and you will be in for a thrilling ride. Most of the personlities are believable, and they give you some nice twists at the end for a very entertaining read."
1,If I could give it one star,"This book is a trick. It appears as if you are going to get hard science fiction, but it is just an advert for American style Christianity. I read about 60 pages and was wondering why the focus on religion, when I happened to look at the back. I saw it was published by Bethany Publishing. Jaysus, no pun intended, but it should be in the Christain section. What a gip"
5,Web of Suspicion,"I enjoyed Ingermanson's ""Transgression,"" but this book takes his writing to another level. What starts out as a basic trip to Mars (could that really be basic?) turns into a nightmare of suspicion, sabotage, and stretches of faith. Through witty and believable dialogue, with detailed research and thorough but never cumbersome facts, the authors sweep us along into a captivating scenario. Along the way, we come to know Bob and Valkerie and the others that surround their work and relationship. The web of suspicion draws tighter and tighter until the last fifty pages when even further surprises are revealed. What seems to be a fairly straightforward survival-in-space story contains much more. I read the last paragraph with a smile, a short laugh, and my heart in my throat. This is smooth and effortless storytelling. Well worth it."
4,Spellbinding,This book was loaned to me by a friend of the author and kept me coming back every free moment until I finished it. The plots twists and turns kept me guessing until the very end. Can't wait for the sequel.
4,Good suspenseful christian reading!,"Good reading! I enjoyed every page of this book.A Trip to Mars in just a few short years? I don't know, but if we did, what might the trip be like...I picked up this book and at first thought, oboy what did I pick up... These men have big creditials and it's a space story. How would I find interest in this. Well I started reading and before I knew it, I was done the book.This is one of those books you don't judge by it's cover. It's a bit of everything, politics, media, love, God, relationships, doubt, suspense...You name, they put it in this book and did it well."
3,"Good story, with some flaws","I found the plot to be quite entertaining. However, I have a feeling that if you're not a christian believer, you will find the periodic musings about faith to be somewhat trite and silly. But if you can ignore those areas, you'll discover a fairly exciting story."
5,Oxygen,"This Sci-Fi novel about the first attempted trip to Mars is exciting, thought provoking, and a real page-turner. The characters are people I really care about and the scientific information is great! I like the romance angle, too. There's something that will appeal to nearly everyone in this book!"
5,Does the job...,"These boots are easy to put on and keep your feet warm and dry.If it's super cold, I wear thick wool socks with them, but I can alsoslip into them without any socks to run outside in the snow andcold for the morning paper, etc.Comfy and true to size for me."
4,Comfortable and waterproof,"This boot is very comfortable (as Clarks usually are) and completely waterproof. I put sheepskin insoles in them and I have to say that they are quite warm, even in slightly below freezing temperatures. The downside is they do not breathe well so not great if you are shopping indoors for a couple of hours. The only other negative is that I found when they are fully zipped up, after walking for a bit I noticed that my socks were slowly sliding down and the boot would rub slightly at the front of my leg. The solution for me is to leave the zipper unzipped only about an inch from the top and then no problem."
1,AWFUL !!!!!,"A collage of noises with some music thrown in.As much as I love ALL of these guys previous records,including the live one and their former band's Epileptics,somebody has to warn people about this one.It's no less than 59 minutes of assorted human,animal,and mechanical noises with ten minutes of whackos pounding at their instuments scattered along the recording.Plus ,there's no other way of getting at the music other than f.fwding it like it was a cassette,coz all of the cd is TOCd as ONE track !!! I'm afraid I'll sound like my parents,but what's with this racket ???!!!!"
1,avoid!,"this record is terrible, and is reminiscent of crass' yes sir i will, except worse. one track, with music in the background and various noise and feedback at the forefront. avoid at all costs!"
3,"It's nowhere near the appeal that Alias had, but the album is no slouch either","Former Alias vocalist Freddy Curci returns with an all-new backing band. You may remember Alias from their late 80s super-mega-hit ballad ""More Than Words Can Say."" Curci and company try to stay true to the rock formula of the 80s with the lyrics and arraignments on this album, but the band deliver with a more contemporary and modern sound. The result is really a by-the-numbers melodic rock affair, with a few songs that you'll carry with you for a bit. It's nowhere near the appeal that Alias had, but the album is no slouch either."
5,dreamcraft reprint mels books,"This is a fab book reprinted by dreamcraft who now do all the mel keegan books http://www.dream-craft.com/melkeegan/they even have an unabridged copy of deaths head replacing the 20,000 words left out of the original and also the latest narc book scorpio printed in 2004"
1,Not superior,"The product did not match the description of ""Four layers, top is durable, bottoms is soft"". The bottom layer was not soft. I was disappointed in the quantity and I returned the car cover."
1,this is a joke,"Joi the author of this book had an affair with my husband when I had a three week old baby. It is A JOKE that she is writing about how women should treat other women. Are you kidding me Joi? Perhaps you should read your own work and take it to heart. You destroyed the chance of my daughter every having a two parents home, I moved boxes out of that house cursing your name. How dare you claim to be a good soul and woman. You are a homewrecker."
3,It depends on what you like in a game...,"I'd call this a fair game.If you like wreaking havoc,this is agreat game. Wreck cars by blowing them away with missles,pushingthem into lakes,or just plain wrecking them.Murder people byshooting them or running them down.If you just want to play thegame,this is also a good game.Blow enemies to smithereens, pickup vips, and follow the police chopper to complete levels.This is kind of a boring game because it seems empty.It coulduse more finesse. If the towns had more tourists,traffic,andother things common in cities,like in Driver 2 ( a game I reco-mmend) this game would be improved. Also,the missions are a little difficult.What I really recommend:Rent it first."
5,Stop in the name of love!,Save yourself about $40! Buy Bluesin; Around for about $10. It's exactly the same Columbia early recordings from 1960-62! Oh I need a few more words! God Save The Queen!
4,One good journey deserves another...,"Almost 50 years after Che's Motorcycle Diaries, Symmes recreates the journey on a BMW-R80. Covering over 10,000 miles of open road and experiencing several mechanical breakdowns as well as roadside disasters, Symmes masterfully inspires the traveler within us to break away and move on. Near the conclusion of his trip he makes an assertion, ""This moment of life, alone at dusk in the rain at twelve thousand feet with nothing, is still enough...I could live through the rain and the darkness and the bad roads and everything I owned disappearing into the bottom of a cloud. But I could not live without this trip, without some movement. In a life of restless longing, the only hope lies somewhere ahead."""
4,"Better than ""Motorcycle Diaries"" ...","Just finished this book, and I liked it. I read Motorcycle Diaries a few days before, and did NOT like it.This book is a better ""Motorcycle Diaries"". The writing is good, the story is fun, the experiences are great.There are times when I think he gets a bit too opinionated, and he'll run on and on, but overall this is a great read."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"Patrick Symmes killed me with his book CHASING CHE, squashing me somewhere between Che and the peasant who generously offered him a pineapple, gratis. I don't need Guevera, or Che, translated to me by someone who recognizes kindness primarily as a survival mechanism. CHASING CHE was good enough to get me to read up to page 147, but I could read no further, as Symmes found it necessary to deconstruct the act of pineapple giving into its more selfish parts. He killed this good thing very dead, and I realized then that his point of view lacked humanity. I lost interest in him, and his bike, and his saddlebags, and his intellect, and his killer ax. It is a shame, really, because by page 147 I was almost ready to let him skewer Ernesto himself, as anyone who has ever read MOTORCYCLE DIARIES knows he justly deserves. Symmes has the heart of a predator, and I am sure he has many trophies. I would not count The Legend Of Che among them, however. Che got away."
3,on the road with Che and Symmes,"This was the second read after several years. Still enjoyable, I think mostly to people who have ever wondered ""Who was this Che person?"" in the first place. As I have always found the Cuban revolution interesting, I was curious about Che Guevera. Patrick Symmes provides us with a lot of background on the subject, interwoven with a motorcycle trip of his own, tracing Che's pre-revolutionary, self-seeking trip through South America.Yes, Symmes must have had a lot of time on his hands and loved journalism as an art to attempt this journey, but I know just enough about South America to find his adventures fascinating. It's kind of like a real long article in Newsweek, but a good one."
4,As good as book 1,"Another good Lori Wick book. This one was better than boom two. I disagree with some of the reviews I've read saying it was to sweet. There was death, anger, a kidnaping, etc. not sure how you would call it too sweet. Moving on to the forth and final book in the series."
2,Disappointing,These flash cards are disappointing in the pictures being drawn in black and white. The info on the back of the cards is very sparse... Clumsy to work with. Printed on inferior quality paper for flash cards.
3,flash cards,"While these cards are good for basic review, they are missing some of the posterior muscles."
3,A&P flashcards ok,Anatomy and Physiology flashcards were not as I expected and not useful for my beginning anatomy courses in massage therapy training because each card carried much more information than I was trying to drill myself for. I found them much more helpful in my physiology courses because these courses studied the systems covered by the cards. I could select the systems under study at the moment and use the cards to focus my attention. The excellent graphics helped me to visualize the systems and retain in memory their locations in the body.
3,Review of Anatomy and Physiology Flash Cards by Juan Oyola,"This product (Although a great addition to my massage libreary)has some drawbacks. It has no mention of basic chemistry at all,and the introdutory information should be of a more extended nature. However,the delivery process was quite expedient.Juan Oyola,Asheville,N.C."
3,Lotus Guide Review by Rahasya Poe,"Founding Fathers, Secret Societies:Freemasons, Illuminati, Rosicrucians, and the Decoding of the Great SealBy Robert Hieronimus, PhDISBN 1-59477-087-5 (Destiny Books/Inner Traditions, 2006)In a time when we are searching for a clear vision for America's future, Founding Fathers, Secret Societies unveils the importance of not only the original vision of those who formed this nation but also their warnings, all of which are captured in the symbols they created. To see the influence the Iroquois Native Americans had on our early documents was as refreshing as it was surprising in light of how that relationship degenerated through the years. Living in times when the average teenager knows hundreds of corporate logos, I think it only makes sense that this is an important read for young and old to find understand of the esoteric meaning of our symbols.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide magazine [...]"
4,America's True Founders,"Revealing look at America's founding fathers, who adopted the Iroquois confederacy concept. For in depth masonic info (& America's hidden history), check out Secret Destiny of America and Brotherhood of the Sun."
2,Boring read,"I bought this book without doing any research on the author of the book. Something which I will never do again!Needless to say, I couldn't finish reading this book. The book may be full of important information, however the author failed to establish rapport with the readers which make it a boring read."
3,Secret Societies,"Written too much like a text book or white paper for my taste. It is very informative, but redundant in some cases as well."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed. I had planned on reading a book that I thought would provide me with unbiased and factual historical information, and instead I learned all about Robert Hieronimus' personal agenda and political leanings."
1,WAY off the deep end...,"Without a doubt, the WORST book I've read on Freemasonry, history, the Founding Fathers . . . or the Feminist movement. This guy has his own agenda, and it's just . . . weird. The first part of the book is mildly entertaining, and I found myself sort of interested. Then he goes off on a surrealistic tangent that is beyond comprehension. I suspect this guy spent WAY too much time in San Francisco in the sixties hangin' out with Timothy Leary and has done WAY too much Purple Haze and Four Way Window Pane. Save your money. Buy anything else."
1,Avoid this book,"Imagine you're a First Nations student, and all the stories you ever read represent your people as dead, dying or drunk. When oh when are writers going to give their readers a few positive First Nations role models? There was no need for the mother to die in the first sentence of this novel, nor for the father to be a drunk. Let's use a little imagination, you writers! Why couldn't the scenario have the father in a positive role, perhaps teaching the children about the land, when some accident happens, leaving them to fend for themselves. And why don't any of the editorial reviewers mention this tiresome sterotyping? Please do not buy this book."
3,"Toughboy and Sister, tough language as well","After reading ""The Year Of Miss Agnes"" with my 9 year old we eagerly ordered ""Toughboy and Sister"". What a disappointment! I don't feel that even mild profanity is appropriate in a book sold for the 9-12 age level. Nor was I pleased with two different examples of taking the Lord's name in vain. This book was ordered for a book report for my daughter but was a waste as it cannot be used in her Christian school.The sad thing for us is that the story is great, and would have been just as good without including words that are offensive to a whole group of parents."
1,A completely useless mess,"Poorly printed, you can't even decipher the graphs for example. No sensible order to it. Appears to be a simple reprint of a clump of articles that were first printed in 1874 and haven't been adapted, added to or corrected ever since. Bad grammar. No index, so impossible to find, for example, the history of the Continental Notes or when the first Dollar Bills appeared. Completely useless and a waste of money. I've only given it one star because there is no facility for giving it none or minus"
5,Excellent music and deserving of a listen!,"Phil and Natalie LaRue, brother and sister artists, are such fine performers! The songs they wrote are filled with contemporary issues and themes. Their vocals are indeed excellent and I admit I was surprised by how different their styles are - pleasantly surprised. This is a fine debut CD with wonderful music pregnant with meaning for the believer. This is excellent Contemporary Christian music and the best song on the CD - ""Someday"" - poignantly expresses both longing and hope simultaneously to the listener.This is a fine CD without a bad song on it. I recommend this CD with five stars."
5,I love it!,"I absolutely love this CD. I have had it for almost four years now, and I still am not sick of listening to it! (my normal CD listening time is like 3 months) I love every song on the CD. Each song has had personal meaning to my life. I have used several of the songs as part of my devotionals that I give as a camp counselor. Someday has special significance to me, because that song portrays my commitment to God and my future husband in a way that I could never have done. The raw feeling that the bro/sis duo show through their music makes it feel real. Some song on this CD would be to anyone's life. The musicality of the CD is AWESOME too! I love their voices, and they have a great blend. Once again, I love it!"
5,SOul savers,I first saw Phillip And Natalie At a concert at a college I was amazed at there voices and how they where so nice I got to talk to there dad and he was nice And it was a really good Cd I am glad they write there own stuff And i was depressed but some thing in there music touched me and some friends who are christens prayed with me and i became a child of christ so thank you you saved my soul I just am so happy now because of god i have been in his love so thank you
5,A MustBuy,"This CD is one of the best things that has happened to Christian popmusic in modern time. Good lyrics and great music. If you're only going to buy one CD this year, buy this one!"
3,Osborne Brothers,"All right nothing i would order again, I guess it just depends on if you like them or not. Wish it had their tops hits and we wouldof liked it better"
3,"A good start, but not substantial","If you need a quick crash course in tourister Korean, this tape is a good start. The narrator gives you brief English-Korean quizzes, and you practice listening to short Korean conversations. However, the transcription is romanized, not actual hangul. This is ok if you only want a basic introduction, but it will essentially render you illiterate in Korea. If you are at all serious about learning Korean, find a tape that has actual hangul script. It is more difficult to read at first, but the alphabet is completely phonetic and quickly mastered. This course is a good beginning, but not complete."
1,not the best,The Best of Michael Jackson is a compilation of Michael Jackson's greatest hits and was released in 1975 by his former record company Motown. It sold 2.2 million copies worldwide and peaked at number forty-four on the U.S. R&B album chart.
1,Awful,"The contents of all the bottles were completely dry. The expiration on the bottles was March '07, which explains why the contents were no good. Very disappointing, and I returned the entire shipment. I have been assured that I'm receiving a credit for the items, but not for the shipping. That's a disappointment, too."
2,won't work,Ordered this Game starts out ok but after the menu screen will not work...... Keeps going back to start screen....
1,waste of time and money,this game makes you never want to go to a theme park again it is so horrible
4,HAHAHA! WHAT A JOKE!,"DONT BUY THIS GAME! WHAT EVER YOU DO!the Grpahics are like 1D! not worth 2D graphics, loads of rides though BUT, they need fixing within a minute, and if you dont fix it then your rides blow up..... the maps are disgusting, the same size every time i bought it because someone said it was good, i shot him for it :) its not even worth 1the only good thing is, its good for young children, its not complicated. stupid people in your park says, ""i need to sit down"" but you cant even buy benches!DONT RENT IT DONT BUY IT DONT EVEN BORROW IT FROM A FRIEND IT WILL MAKE YOU PUKE!"
2,Poorly-chosen anthology; fantastic writer,"We're far enough away from Lardner's heydey that it should be fairly easy to spot his best work from his enormous output. In this case, we're talking fiction -- there's an awful lot of non-fiction to be collected properly, yet -- and so it's mystifying why so much of this fairly slim anthology is Lardner's mediocre work. Where are such great stories as ""I Can't Breathe"" or (arguably) ""Haircut""? Also, why excerpt so much of YOU KNOW ME AL when it's either best read cover to cover or represented with two or three pieces (to whet the appetite) and then moving on?The earlier collection assembled by Lardner, ROUND UP, is far, far better than this. This great writer's books have all but disappeared from most bookstores; with a collection like this carrying his flag, it's no wonder why someone might simply shrug and ask what, exactly, is the big deal?This should rate two and a half stars -- not an option here."
5,Simply Amazing,"This album is amazing. its for shure the best doc album right up with home sweet home. It starts of with the first song doc ever learned on the banjo (his first instrument after the harmonica), and from there it is some what chronological, starting with old time ballads and foot stompers and ending with full band arangements and merle's masterpeice; thoughts of never. It is full of merle tearing it up on the slide guitar and has a bunch of songs where doc kills the banjo clawhammer style. There are songs with drums, fiddle and even fender rhodes piano on a couple. Cloumbus stockade is a standout dark and roudy number, and moody river will break anyones heart thats not a complete idiot. Merle plays a real pritty slide guitar on miss the mississippi next to doc's real, real pritty singing. Anyways, this cd is full of serious heart breakers and roudy numbers that will have you hitting the bottle and letting out rebel yells. This is the best doc watson album ever."
5,depinga el cd,"desde ohio para venezuela el mejor de los cantantes inspiradoresde sueños y romances, que bueno el cd de exitos que es dobleya que tre mucha buena musica y no te vas a decepcionar con estecd, garantizado si eres fan y si te gusta franco pana. chao"
5,Great product,Bought these for a 10 year olds 1950s style bday party on the park & they worked a treat! Great for kids & the adults used them too. Sturdy enough to withhold kids playing with them. And great price for buying in bulk.
5,Right on!,"Although this is a bit outdated version, I recently used it on a trip in 2007 and almost everything was still correct. The stories were well written and the whole guide entertaining and informative. I needed no other book, but I agree, a supplimental street map was helpful. I especially liked that for each restaurant, or sight, it listed the metro stop. I had a wonderful trip to an amazing city with this book!!!"
5,In Guide,Prague is a magical city and it deserves an unusual guide. Its narrow streets with cobble stones ask to be discovered and it is actually easy with the Avantguide. It contains precious insider's information on places away from the tourist center where you hardly meet other tourists.
5,Inspirational and Motivating,"I was lucky enough to see this film in theaters - and was blown away. The story touches on so many different emotions, it's hard to not be moved by Jay DeMerit's tenacity. The story of Jay's rise from the soccer fields of Green Bay, Wisconsin to the biggest stage on Earth, at the World Cup was incredible. The movie itself was beautifully directed. This is a must watch not just for soccer fans, but for all sports fans, and those looking for inspiration in life."
5,Fantastic rice!,"I love this rice! It always turns out perfectly (I use a saucepan--not a rice cooker). Just make sure you follow the directions. The RiceSelect products are consistently good. Another plus is that they are grown and processed here in the great state of Texas, in Galveston county. As another reviewer mentioned, the plastic containers the rice comes in are a pleasure to use, and can be recycled to hold macaroni, fideo, etc."
5,fail-safe sticky rice,"I've tried several sticky rice products and have ruined many a meal. However, this product turns out consistently well."
3,size mattters,"the picture looks like the size in the stores, but disappointed when I recievd it because it was half size"
3,Expensive,"This is great rice, tender when cooked and sticky. But the price is way too expensive. I bought a bigger bag for the nearly same price at the local market. Look around your town for a far more reasonable price."
3,"RiceSelect Sushi Rice, 36-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4","Rice Select Sushi Rice, 36-Ounce Jars Pack of 4.July 27, 2011I like the rice, it cooks up good, and has a good flavor. However, In the past few month's the price has gone up 6.00 with subscribe & save. I won't be buying rice select any longer."
5,I HATE RBF - not really.,"I love this cd! The sound quality isn't as good as the others, but for a first cd its great! I love you ReeL BiG FiSH! I love this cd, and all of its silly songs. If you're a RBF fan, you'll LOVE Everything Sucks"
4,Bye this cd,If you love Reel Big Fish with all of your harte.....then you have to bye this cd. You can't call your self a RBF fan if you don't have it.
3,RBF is ok with this album,ive loved rbf for years now and i finally bought this title from amazon.com. It is allright but you have to realize the sound quality is lacking and the songs seem a little slower. dont buy unless you are a huge rbf fan with $16 burning a hole in your pocket.
3,Good thing they improved!,"This CD really isn't as good as the following two CD's they have released. It's just not as catchy and fast as Turn the radio off, and it doesn't have the quality as Why do they rock so hard does."
4,Sums up their style,I love reel big fish and this is a good cd but i dont recommend it to people who have the other cds. If your a really big fan who wants 50 of everything by them then buy it...it only has a few new songs that arent on other cds. the other songs are on other cds but they are different because they had other members in the band...if you are buying this cd to be your first by them its a good choice because it has many of their different styles on it. i also recommend buying keep your receipt as a first album by them because its cheaper and still gives you a taste of their style.
2,Not a big fan of this particular CD,"I absolutely love ""Why Do They Rock So Hard?"" and ""Turn Your Radio Off"".But this CD, which is a re-release of their first CD is no where near as good as the other two. If you don't yet own an RBF CD, I would recommend buying either of the other two.This CD has a very amateur sound quality to it. Which makes sense since this was their first CD, and they didn't have much money to produce it.For the most part, the songs on this CD can be found on either of the other CDs (some with different titles). The songs sound better on the other CDs, and the other songs on the CD are better than these.I pretty much would call this CD a ""Worst of"" Reel Big Fish. There are a few really good songs on the CD, but if you already have an RBF CD, you've probably already heard them, and with better quality."
2,Disappointing for serious quilters,I am a long-time quilter who loves modern patterns and innovative design; I was so excited to see this book. When it arrived I knew after flipping through it once that I would be returning it--and I never return quilt books. Be aware that hardly any of the patterns are for quilts--most are for household objects. And what's frustrating about those patterns for things like slippers is that they don't seem as though they would produce results that are going to hold up well. Oh well. I'd recommend that non-beginners skip this and get two great Kerr/Ringle books: Color Harmony for Quilters and The Modern Quilt Workshop instead.
3,"Pretty to look at, but disappointing if you want a book about quilts","After looking at Denyse Schmidt's website, I was very excited to purchase her book and start making unique quilts of my own! While her instructions in ""Denyse Schmidt Quilts"" are very clear, and there are numerous helpful hints, only 1/4 of the book addresses actual quilts. For those who are interested in oven mitts, quilted scarves, and small-scale projects, this is a delightful and pretty book to choose. However, for those (like myself) who are looking for a book dedicated to quilts (and not patchwork projects) you would be better served checking out other sources. I purchased the Modern Quilt Workshop in addition to Denyse Schmidt Quilts and would highly recommend it as an alternative"
4,Love the designs but enlarging patterns gets expensive,Love the book and projects but it cost me $8 to enlarge one pattern at Kinkos...next time I will try to fit 2 or 3 more on the same copy
3,Mehh,"Years ago I saw Denise Schmidt profiled on Christopher Lowell of all places. Her designs stuck with me, but so did her technique, someone else did all the sewing and then she sent her quilt tops off to be finished by Amish quilters. I sort of thought it was like cheating. I don't know if this is how her process still works, but the book sure feels that way. The quilts are still wonderfully designed, fun and feel good to look at, but the projects are so simplistic it's like she wasn't even trying.While it's tons of fun to look at, I'm very glad I got it at the library. It's really not worth paying for. She should really get kudos for her aesthetic, not her technique."
5,Ruth,This book is awesome! I started taking a quilting class and the person at my table had her books...I immediately had to get them! The pictures are great and it is easy to understand the directions. The book gives you some great ideas and you can also use your creativity to create your own versions of the projects.
4,crafty quilting,"My sister gave this book to me and I love it! It has great photo's and gets the creative juices flowing. However, I am not a serious quilter more of a crafty quilter.I wouldn't suggest this for the serious quilter."
2,"Move along, folks...nothing to see here...","If you can already sew uneven seams and piece cockeyed log cabin squares then just whip up some overly-simplistic bags and coasters and stuffed animals and you've conquered the first half of this book. If you want to quilt, skip the uninspiring second half of ""Denise Schmidt Quilts"" and just buck up and pay the shipping on Ringle and Kerr's ""The Modern Quilt Workshop"" and be inspired and excited to create."
3,Denyse Schmidt Quilts,Denyse Schmidt's work has a very commercial look borrowing patterns from African American quilters and Amish solid colors. They have a strong modern architectural feel and will be very successful when reproduced for the mass bedding market.My favorite item in the book is the stuffed cat.
5,Great!!,"This is a great book, it helped me learn techniques for doing my own quilt work. I searched around and found several web sites that all had wonderful things to say about her book.. you should read it for yourself, as this is truly a wonderful book.. She does amazing works of art with fabric, and the best part is they can even keep you warm. You should definately check this book out, you will love it."
4,Great for beginners,"I just started training my first colt this past summer and found this book very easy to follow. I was able to take the lessons step by step and had my colt going nicely on the trail in a little over two months. I recommend it to anyone who trains, but especially the person just starting out with their own colt."
1,Not to my horse!!,"I would never do the things in this book to my horse. No way, not ever! (Not even to my hubbys grouchy mare) I would not tie a horses mouth around so it gives to the bit! I would not saddle her up, for the first time, and just get on with no preperations and canter her on her first ride. This book is not for helping your youngster learn, it is forceful."
4,Imaginative Environmental Tale For Children,"If you like fun and adventure, you'll like this story about two teenagers' journey deep into the rain forests of Borneo, in search of Orangutans. An imaginative and captivating tale, it is funny and at the same time poignant. It teaches children about the fragile balance between civilization and nature and the delicate web that binds us all together. It leaves us with an understanding of the plight of the Orangutans, as well as with a sense of hope.I read this book with my 10 year old daughter and we loved it!"
5,AMERICAN HERO,THIS IS A GREAT STORY FOR OUR TIME. HE GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR THE TRUTH OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN VIETNAM. A TRUE AMERICAN OF DISSENT TO KEEP OUR DEMOCRACY CREDITABLE. AN EXAMPLE OF COURAGE FOR OUR TIMES.
1,Easily the worst book I have ever read.,"""Seconds of Pleasure"" gave me just that - only seconds of pleasure, and hours of distaste. Neil LaBute is a talentless, charmless hack. His book was like Bukowski without the heart, and ""American Psycho"" without the wit."
1,Some nice diagrams between minimally researched text,"The diagrams copied and compiled from government manuals and publications are the most worthy portion of this book. If you are looking for research on underground bases or additional insights into this phenomenon, Underground Bases is NOT the book for you.Saunder presents a very loosely written and minimally researched description of underground bases. The number of times Saunder comments that he cannot confirm nor deny information is appalling -- that is, he does not know and did not find out. Loose speculation, extreme generalizations, reliance on publicly available government documents, and wild space alien allusions permeate the thin (fortunately it is short) volume. Most people with an interest in this topic probably already know the contents of this book."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!! This crackerjack box of a book holds no prize-,"Credibility is EVERYTHING here. Who is this guy? Ph.D. in what? From where? Out of body experiences ? Not a whisper anywhere that I can find about his alleged scholarly credentials.. I've seen better writing in a 6th grade newpaper.A lot of weakly supported conjecture. If the govt really DOES have this massive network of underground bases and wanted to keep it a well kept secret- all they have to do is subsidize the printing of Bull crap books like this..Sorry, Richard- I'm going back to my Stephen King novels. Not impressed. I was hoping to find something to substaniate this theory .If 'The Truth is Out There', you won't find much here."
1,The Truth is Out There . . .,". . . unfortunately, it's hard to find in this book. The author crams 50 pages of well documented fact into 130 pages, with frequent and meaningless caveats. Save your money, skip this book."
3,bases are everywhere and nowhere,"I live in WV yet have not checked out the Greenbrier yet I know of its existence and purpose. I bought the book...slightly disappointed but it did have photos and accounts to support what he was covering and reporting. There are many clandestine bunkers, bases or hideouts but not necessarily for scary reasons. To hide and operate from where prying eyes cannot see or hear activities from below...but makes you wonder who is in control or made the installations...but digging deeper, investigating tunneling machines that are not discussed in modern-day media as well leads credence to something that may be too much for the average citizen to consider, understand and comprehend. Hoping more would be in-depth but overall a pretty good book highlighting reports and what could be found out was...to a degree/"
2,weak,"weak; provides evidence of govt's interest in underground bases & construction techniques. Unfortunately, he provides little to no evidence that any of these plans were ever put into effect. He does provide a fair number of references to support his assertions of govt interest though."
4,"Great book, but where is the 1999 edition?",This book is very helpful and informative! I would love to see the updated version.
4,Rock/Funk with subdued christian overtones,"I really liked this album--a lot more than their first one--especially good when one takes into account all of the crap of so called ""Christian"" music at the time (I hate that label--does Christian describe a certain sound of music???) Three of them later formed a spinoff group called LLoyd (not the rapper), and released an absolutely great alternative/modern rock album in 1998 (Thoughts From A Driveway), which in my opinion, is even heads & tails above anything Imagine This ever recorded. One of my favorites of all time, but I digress. That's just my two cents which is worth, well, about two cents..."
3,Definitely old-school,Pretty good for as old as it is. It tends to get stuck in your head. I like it because it has a good variety of sounds.
2,so disappointing.....,"This book is WAY too expensive for what it is, especially for a paperback! There is some good general information in it, but I was expecting something much different. Many of the suggestions are little more than common sense and good teaching. The one good thing it does do is match up the interventions with specific problem behaviors. I was hoping for some innovative ways to help support or change behavior and am disappointed. Save your money. You can buy several books with great ideas in them for the same amount or less!"
1,RF blocking didn't work,"The wallet itself is compact and have slots to keep the cards. However, the RF blocking doesn't seem to work. This is the reason I brought this wallet (at $60). It was a disappointment and a waste of time."
2,Not Worth [the $],"It has the worst graphics out of all of the games I own. It is kind of fun when you first play it for the first time. Then it starts to get boring,you stop playing it and it is like it disappears,you only play it for about 5 minutes once a month or even once a year."
1,The book Archeologhy of Madness - Komitas - ...,"Dear Sir,As a reader of the above mentioned book and a close relative of Komitas, I disagree and reject the statements of the author about Komitas' childhood. My maternal grandmother, Marig who is referred to in the book, is Komitas' cousin and they have been brought up together and fed by my grand grandmother. Although the author was supplied our true version of the story told by Marig herself, the author has totally disregarded the truth and even misquoted Marig's statements thus distorting the childhood life of Komitas.The Karakashian and Tashjian families, being the close relatives of Komitas, regretfully reject the author's opinion and false statements about Komitas' childhood life.Sincerely,Sebouh Z. TashjianSydney - Australia"
5,For a use take European DVD-player,"Saw the * - I never heard of problems before, but must be a thing in USA. Take a European DVD-player ( Baujahr ca. 2008 ff. ) for 20,- ( available on .de ) and try it again... There are 3 Kult Klassix available!!!"
1,Unplayable CD,"Wow! I thought I was the only one who had these problems with the discs. I too ordered a copy and when I received it, it had a white film that rendered the both discs unplayable. Thinking it was just a one-off error, I returned it to Amazon and, to their credit, they sent me a new copy right away. Both discs had the exact same problem.After reading the other reviews, I don't think properly-pressed editions of this title exist."
1,Multiple copies of this CD were defective!!!,"MI ordered it twice, once from amazon marketplace, and then from Amazon, and both times, they were sealed copies. But when I opened the CD, BOTH volumes (it's a 2 CD set) were covered in a nasty white film on the readable sides of the CD, and were unplayable. I was shocked after I sent back the first copy, and then got a copy from good old reliable Amazon and found that copy defective too. Is this some sort of issue with the manufacturer???"
1,I had the exact same problem as the other reviewer,"I had the exact same problem with my copy of KULT KLASSIX... It arrived in an unplayable condition exactly like your two copis. A friend said that it's definitely some kind of manufacturing problem.I was able to extract a few tracks with a sensitive CD burner that could read through the cloudiness of the CD surfaces and decode the digital tracks back into sound, re-record the sound into my hard drive, and re-master sound so I could have playable tracks of the 12"" mixes of ""Blindvision"" and ""Big Man Restless""... I know, it's a lot of trouble, but I love these songs."
4,Greg Graffin a man of many shades of music,"Wow from Bad religion, to his own solo he decides to write a folk-musical record. This albulm I gave four stars, since its not good not bad, my opion its in between but still worth buying. If you want to hear something other than what you usually listen to pick this up."
4,Pretty Good,"I don't see many people outside of the Bad Religion fan base giving this much of a try, which is a shame, but it's a cool record. Don't read so into the song choices, and the what / where/ and why....Buy it and listen to it. It's pretty good! Good job Greg! Hey, I have been listening to punk rock for years and years...You get older and wiser...this is that kind of record. I like it and listen to it a lot."
5,Great album,Who knew that bluegrass/country music could be so punk?It took a couple of listens to bring me around. Im glad I thetook time to really listen to the whole album again. 5 StarsDr. Graffin!
3,It ain't no bad religion,"These songs are interesting in that they are old style 1800s country/folk tunes, and its unique to hear Graffin singing them. I did not expect punk when I Bought this but I must admit the previews made me think I'd like them a bit better. I ended up being 50/50 on whether or not I should have got this, but I own it now, and for that I say 3 stars ""Its okay"" but don't spend your last $10 on the digital album."
4,Desk for computer room,"I purchased this desk due to the limited space I have. It is a great fit for small spaces, however, it was very difficult to put together with the given directions."
5,I don't read spy novels...,"I don't read spy novels usually. I am pretty much a scifi and fantasy person. That being said, I really enjoyed this book. I had a great time. It kept me guessing, but nothing proceeded implausibly from what had gone before. The pieces fit nicely. Somewhere in the middle third I thought we were going to see a collision between the two main protagonists, and we did, but things got pretty twisted before, during, and after we got there. Since this is not my usual genre, I can't easily make comparisons to other books, but I can say that I enjoyed the ride. (my only regret is that I didn't read the book in one chunk rather that with a break in the middle, which would have increased the suspense and impact.)"
4,Spy novel pickings have been sparse,"Spy novel readers have had sparse pickings the last ten years. Both the characters and the plot twists in Woods' Autley House reminded me of why I read all of LeCarre, Deighton and Ludlum. Let's hope Woods finds ideas in contemporary events to feed his storymaking."
4,Shaping The Waves,"I received the book well in time and it is in an emmaculate condition. I would recommend if Amazon can put a plastic cover on the book in future, for the book to last longterm, with a small page marker."
3,"Interesting, but hardly flattering",The book presents Harvard MBA's as rather clueless individuals collecting a Rolodex of contacts but little else. Freshly minted MBA's take entry level jobs (which somehow lead to vice presidential slots within short order) because they claim they need to learn from experience and know nothing about management. Did they learn anything in Harvard Business School? Apparently not. Did they gain access to an incredible old-boy network? Certainly.
4,A First Novel with Promise,"Between Two Rains is a first novel with such a whiff of promise that I have been very disappointed not to see any new book from Harriet Heyman.The novel starts off with Mirie living in New York with her boyfriend, Jonathan. This part of the book is a little strained and doesn't quite feel real, and Mirie's purported desire to be the first person to photograph an elephant giving birth seems a bit bogus, but never mind; its purpose is to propel Mirie to Africa.The African settings are described so vividly that the reader will feel sweat running down his/her own neck. The people that Mirie meets in Africa -- Max, Frances, government officials -- breathe with real life.This book doesn't contain any deep discoveries about life, but it feels as though with more practice, the author could be writing books with great insight into people and what makes them tick.Harriet Heyman, if you ever read this review, do me a favor and write another book!"
5,Michael Franti and Spearhead-Yell Fire,"This CD arrived quickly and was well packaged. Also, ""Yell Fire"" is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. BUY IT!"
4,Inspiring and hopeful for a peaceful world...,"You will not be disappointed in this wonderful, inspiring CD by one of the most poignant songwriters today. Michael Franti does it again - he can make you laugh, cry, think, and most of all DaNcE!!! I love it...my kids love it. Beautiful messages about tolerance and peace."
4,Awesome lyrics varied music!,"Michael Frant's poetry is at once timely and timeless. He uses current, hard hitting, political images and themes to express an open-minded, inclusive, compassionate philosophy that makes me feel like simply listening to him is a step toward a more peaceful, generous world.I'm 55; this album was recommended to me by a couple of 23 year olds. And while ""Yell Fire!"" is all about a driving stand up and be counted rhythm, ""One Step Closer to You"" is the perfect mellow choice for a Middle School slow dance. It's a revolution for all ages!!!"
5,Great CD,"This is an excellent Cd. It is a great combination of insightful well crafted lyrics and great music. There is not a weak track on it. If you love great music, regardless of genre, buy this CD."
4,Love IS enough,"I was not familiar with Michael Franti until I caught his performance at the California Worldfest in July. This is important music for these times. At once inspirational,encouraging and most of all MOVING. Impossible not to get up and dance to. Michael appealed to EVERYONE in the audience. I am very happy with this cd which I purchased after the concert."
5,Michael Franti,Michael is a true artist and great singer and I am growing to love his music more and more. I like some of his music better than others. This is a good CD.
5,"great music, great message","Michael Franti seemlessly unites various musical styles on this upbeat disc charged with political and social commentary. It's positive, it rocks, it's danceable, and Franti is an artist who is actually living his life to make this world better. Yell Fire!"
5,Phenomenal new album,"Yell Fire! is the best CD I've bought this year- and that includes Matisyahu and Ben Harper's new CDs (also both excellent). There are a few songs on here that he's been playing at his shows for the last year but had not been released so if you've seen him live, you'll be thrilled to have them on a recording. Spearhead does an excellent job of bringing each song to its full potential and the album is a mixture of intelligent thoughtful songs (many about the war and current political climate) and ones that were clearly written to make you want to DANCE! Buy it- but more importantly, go see Michael Franti and Spearhead live b/c their shows are better than any album."
3,scoop !,THE SCOOP IS NOT 1 1/2 TBSP. IT IS 1 TBSP. other than that its a great investment ! Just beware if you love strong coffee be sure you know how much your putting inside ! that is all
3,Makes your coffee bag top-heavy,"This coffee scoop is constructed quite well, but it's secondary function as a bag clip is quite useless. Clipping the scoop onto your coffee bag makes it top heavy, and prone to fall over especially when the bag is almost empty.I'd recommend that you buy the scoop and the clip separate."
4,Great Product,"I like the length of this spoon it reaches down deep into the coffee bags, and the clip does keep the bags shut tight. The spoon measures exactly 1 tbsp level not the 1/12 tbsp in the description and on the package, this is not a big problem, just wanted you to know. The spoon has a nice heavy feel and is longer than the ekobrew spoon we also have so it reaches deeper into the coffee bags."
5,Clever clever spoon!,"This is genius! Even my husband was impressed. I guess my coffee doesn't need it's own personal measuring spoon, but dang if I don't love having it. It's a luxury item for sure, but I appreciate having it conveniently hooked to my coffee so everything's ready to go for my morning brew. Works great!"
3,OK for starts,"This book has helped me start to understand my guitar and amp and how they interact. That alone could justify the price of the book.But the title made me think I was going to also learn how to Safely and properly bias my amp, for instance. After reading the book, I'm still not sure how to work Safely with the live head, so I'm buying more books to get the exact steps needed to discharge a Marshall, create a load, hook up a scope, etc.In summary, the price is justified IMO; just don't set your expectation that you'll feel ready to maintain the amp fully without buying other books, working with a pro, etc."
4,Very helpful for the basics,"I bought this book and basically got what I expected, a book aimed a providing guitarists with basic maintenance and upkeep for guitars and amps. As a bassist, I found the book lacking a bit in that particular department, but it's easy enough to apply guitar concepts to bass. The diagrams and explanations are beautifully done though, and contain some very helpful tips that I continue to use on a regular basis, such as the trick for repairing worn out strap nut holes. Those looking for more intricate and specialized guitar and amp repair will want to look elsewhere, but this is a wonderful book to start with."
2,Not very deep at all.,"This book covers guitars and amps very broadly. How to keep them clean and set them up, with some tips on how to deal with solder in order to do a change of pickups. It doesn't go much further than that. In the amps section it is again very broad. Safety procedures for dealing with your amp electronics and some different methods of biasing amps are presented. There is also some discussion of tubes, transistors, and fuses.I found the layout and organization of the information to be needlessly confusing. There is SOME info in here that could be useful to you if you want to take good care of your instruments and don't know where to start.Still, there's gotta be something better out there. That's why I'm only giving it two stars."
3,Good basics: NOT for solid state amps!,"First off, do not get this if you wish to repair a solid state amp. It has one page (62) and it has very little useful information. For me, it was not what I was hoping for.Overall, the book has some great guitar maintenance and diagrams to give you some basic starting points. The price was inexpensive as books go. Some of the guitar wirings diagrams are a bit confusing as they are in black and white. The guitar diagrams vary from Fender to Gibson and others.It has some good electronic diagrams in the back so you can get an idea about electrical schematics. There is a lot of tips for some visual repairs, too.If you have a tube amp, this might be a better book for you. Either that or tube amps are designed to be fixed and solid stat one are designed to be tossed."
4,Guide to Guitar and Amp Maintenance,"It's not bad for the price... I've referred to it a couple of times for simple stuff... really this book is ideal for a beginer who know nothing of working on guitars..... as for amps its a little more detailed but still novice at best..... mostly contains how to clean do very minor repair (removing scratches) how to intonate your guitar, etc etc etc....... all in all I felt it was worth the nine bucks......"
1,Waste............,"If you own a guitar, you probably know how to feed the strings through the tuner-peg holes. You don't need a book to show you how. This book goes over some of the elementary aspects of guitar maintenance that can be searched out on the web......most of these books that claim to offer key insight or special knowledge are a gimmick to make you buy.......there's nothing in here that you can't figure out on your own...........if you're looking to make some kind of in-depth repair to your amp, this book will NOT help you out much either.........anyone that's curious about making an electronic repair to a guitar or amp knows to look for a loose connection or broken solder joint, don't need a book to tell you that already!!I returned my purchase for a refund.............Thanks AMAZON!!"
1,"A poor book, period","Repairing guitar amplifiers, tube or solid-state, is not at all beyond intermediate to advanced electronic hobbyists-but you have to know electronics. You have to know DC and AC electricity, amplification basics, signal paths and how to read basic schematics _cold_,to have any hope of success. You also have to be competent at both ""wire and panel"" and through-hole PCB soldering. You should also have basic test equipment, not only a good multimeter but a signal source-not a guitar!!- a dummy load, and at least a signal tracer but preferably an oscilloscope of some sort. For a lot of reasons, I tend to judge technicians by how competent they are with an oscilloscope, the overwhelmingly single most important test instrument. (Even deaf people can and have successfully built and repaired audio gear with one.)It can be learned from books and practicing-but not from this one."
3,Pika! Pika!,"Formulaic series book, but a favourite of Pokemaniacs wherever they may be. I don't find the Pokemon phenomenon all that offensive. Like most fads and fashions that have preceded it (Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers et al) no doubt it too will pass. All the huff and puff and moralising doesn't change the fact that Disney has retained a grip on child (and older) culture for decades, and that can be as nauseating in its own way as any other mass cultural fad. This book cashes in on the movie, and will be read alone by the competent sub-teen reader, or by parents aloud. There isn't any killing in Pokemon - there are battles, and competition between 'trainers' and their captive Pokemon. The writing is hardly inspiring, but then kids' taste are as eclectic as any one else's - one minute the original Winnie the Pooh, or Alice, the next Pokemon."
2,Willie...you've done better.,"First let me say that I've been listening to and enjoying Willie Nelson's music for going on 30 years and I have alot of respect for him as a performer and songwriter. That said, these twelve arrangements of some of my favorite country songs are really lame. When I first heard about this CD of Willie with the Texas Troubadors, I thought it would surely be a gem, but even the likes of Buddy Charleton (steel) and Leon Rhodes (guitar) can't save this 1965 turkey. The songs all sound either too fast or too slow to me. The arrangements are dated in the worst sense of the word. I guess these were supposed to be the ""hip, now"" arrangements of great country standards, but they just sound overproduced and corny to me. If you want to hear Willie Nelson at his best from the same period, get ""Country Willie-His Own Songs"" and forget this aberration."
1,This book was horrible!,"I am sorry to say, but this book was one of the worst books I have ever read! Although Kesey supposidly wrote about his feelings about society and government, I highly doubt that he knew anything that was going on while he was writing the book. He wrote most of the book while on LSD or peyote which explains why the book is a jumble of thoughts and words put together to look like sentences. In all, this novel should not be considered a classic at all, but a drug induced hallucination put into words!"
2,Vocabulary rather Basic,"While the product itself is lovely, I do not consider almost any of the words on here to be ""SAT"" words. For an early teen they may be a nice vocab boost, but when compared with my SAT vocab flash cards, no word on the curtain is difficult. ""Abstinence"" ""Compromise"" ""Asylum"" ""Submissive"" I consider these common vernacular for a high school student."
5,Great Paddles for Skepticle Beginners,"Paddles worked great in open water. Did not try them in stream enviroment, but would not hessitate. We did not have any problems with splashing or dripping in the kayaks. I am 6 foot tall and loved the length of these paddles. I guess you could spend more on paddles, but these were perfect for my budget.(I dont know what a $200 paddle feels like, so these were just as good as far as im concerned. But I am a beginner.)"
1,Getting rid of junk,"Have two of the same sides of paddles. Have called and have left multiple messages, no response."
5,Nice paddle,"Great paddle for the price. Sturdy paddles are made to ""scoop"" the water and the longer lenth makes this paddle ideal for someone 6'3"". Foam padding on the handles are comfy and prevent hand soreness. Definitely going to buy another of these!!"
4,Not bad for the price.,"The game is good, seemed to take a long time getting to me though. Should have been a couple of days, took almost two weeks, other then that everything went well."
2,"The plural is ""cacti""",How can I trust the advice of someone who doesn't even know the correct name for his subject. Forget it.
4,Invaluable,"This little book was a life saver on our recent trip to Paris - several times we emerged from the Metro and were unsure which way to go to reach our destination. The detailed street maps came to the rescue! The only suggestion I would make to improve the book would be to add a quick reference section of the top tourist locations (Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, etc.). Very glad I purchased this book before travelling to Paris."
4,A really fun read!,I found this book to be a really enjoyable read. The characters are complex without being tideous and the left field sarcasm keeps the story flowing from tragidy to mystery to romance. Especially enjoyable if you're a New Yorker
5,Great stuff!,"I love all kinds of rice, and this is my new favorite one. Cooking rice is not rocket science...and this one is no different. Very easy to make, as long as you have the other required ingredients (onion, chicken broth, etc.) I used chicken stock instead of broth, and I don't know if that's what makes it so yummy, but you will NOT be disappointed with this one!"
2,"WARNING--CONTAINS IMAGES OF GUNS, GUNS, GUNS!","I have always loved this book, and considered it at the number one book I wanted to purchase for my almost four year old son.HOWEVER, when I checked this title out from the library, I noticed the page for the letter K.""Kid Kookaburra and Kelly Kangaroo KIDNAPPING Kitty Koala"", complete with machine guns.If you're okay with guns and lots of images of them for small children, go ahead and buy this book. It IS wonderfully illustrated. If, however, you don't want harrowing images of machine guns (and other little guns, daggers, etc. within other pages) dancing in your young one's head at night, this book is NOT for you. Perhaps an older child could handle this better; but it is certainly NOT an appropriate book (in my opinion) for the under 8 set. Why, oh why, did the author include such images? Otherwise, it would have been my favorite book of this type for children. Buy the ""Where's Waldo"" or ""I Spy"" series instead."
1,NJ mom,"I full heartedly agree with CA mom. My daughter recieved this book as a gift. I could not believe the amount of violence that was portrayed in a child's book. For the letter ""K"" it shows a koala getting kidnapped by a kangaroo with a machine gun. This is not somthing I want my 4 yr old to see. I returned this item immediately."
1,This is not a children's book,"Loving artistic kids' books, I thought the reviews sounded awesome. And they are so universal! I just received this book and was shocked by the violence, morbidity, darkness and eeriness of the themes. Granted, this is the work of a talented artist, but not material for a light-loving soul, much less a toddler. I can't return it fast enough."
5,Special book,This book is very special and I have purchased many copies. This one replaced mine that I gave to my great-granddaughter.
4,Animalia Midi,"I purchased 3 of these books for gifts, however I will be returning 2 of them. I wanted a slip-covered book, but I could not find any description that said it did or did not have a slip-cover. Luckily a teacher-friend bought one, so I only have to return 2. I LOVE this book and author, but this is not what I wanted and I wish the description would have been better so I would not have wasted a week waiting for it in the mail to find out."
5,Better be able to read very well.,This is a wonderful colorful book. My grandchildren love it. It is in all three households and when I would read it to them if I messed up and used a wrong word they would correct me. I would warn you that some of the words are a little hard to pronounce. I have been reading to kids for years and have some collage but the rhyming can be a little tough although the kids love it. I would highly reccomend this book for both the enjoyment of it and because it interduces the kids to more complex words and structure.
5,"wonderful wordsmithing, absolute amusement","I love ""Animalia"", what more can I say but thanks to Mr. Base for taking the time to illustrate it so beautifully, insert the hidden images and find such humorous words. I bought 3 copies, one for each set of grandmonsters and one for my own self so I can pretend to be reading it to them while secretly enjoying it. It is a book for everybody!Lynn Batey"
5,Beautifully illustrated and still amazes me 25 yrs later!,"1986 my mom bought me a book that I studied endlessly, that peaked my imagination and sparked my artistic/creative side. Animalia was such a wonder to me...I could spend hours finding everything on every page then start all over again. I still own the same (first ed) copy and won't let me kids touch it...I will have to buy an extra from here I suppose because it is definately something I want my children to enjoy.I really think this was the book that made me want to draw."
5,Outstanding Alphabet Book!,The language enhancement and brilliant illustrations make this a perfect addition to the ESL/ESOL teacher's repertoire for all age levels.
3,"N IS FOR NAZI, S IS FOR SWASTIKA","No one can deny that Graeme Base's beautifully rendered illustrations entice you to find each and every hidden object. It's fun, it's educational...and occasionally fascist! I was most disturbed to find two examples of swatikas in this children's book: one to represent Nazis on the ""N"" page and another to represent swastika on the ""S"".What kind of message is Mr. Base trying to send to our children?"
5,Really Fun book - for kids and adults,This is one of the most entertaining (for adults!) kids books I have come across. The illustration is magical and so imaginative. The alliteration makes it a fun event for all involved. The hidden 'same letter' pictures will keep you and your little one busy on one page for many minutes at a time. Highly recommended!
5,Stunning Illustration and Alliteration,Beautifully detailed illustrations from cover to cover. Clever use of alliteration. One of my childhood favorites I intend to share with my own children.
4,"Detailed, lavish illustrations","There's two ways to do an alphabet book. The first is to have each letter firmly illustrated by one - and only one! - item. The second, which is the approach taken in this book, is to have as many items as possible crammed onto each page.The result is an alphabet book that grows with your kid, because even a grown-up can spend a lot of time quietly poring over the pages of the book to catch one last detail, find one more F word, locate the boy in the striped shirt on every page.There are a few pages that seemingly indicate violence - hogs going into battle, a kangaroo in a kidnapping, warrior wasps - so parents of more sensitive children will want to read this book before purchasing. Frankly, I think these scenes are not worrisome at all, but others may disagree."
2,No e-commerce specifics,"The title of this book is misleading. Perhaps, a better name for it would be ""Website usability"". I do not want to say this is a bad book, it is simply has almost no e-commerce specifics. There are no examples of real-world ecommerce websites, no wireframe designs, no concrete recommendations on how to organize home page, product pages, shopping cart or checkout. This book may be very useful for a novice in web usability, but it would be a disappointment for more experienced usability specialist."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"California Wild can be summed up with two words - incredibly beautiful. Tim Palmer takes the reader on a trip through the wide variety of geology, botany, and animal life of California in this absolutely gorgeous book. The writing is excellent and makes the reader feel they are a part of the wonderful wilds of California. These are some of the most awe-inspiring works of photography to grace the pages of any nature book. California Wild is highly recommended both for the writing style that invites the reader to be a part of a guided tour of the wilds and for the incredible photography."
5,shakti woman is a fantastic book,i was captivated from the first page on. There is so much in this book that helps me understand my being a woman! Reading this will help you feel less crazy.
2,defective watch bands,"I bought two time teaching watches & within two weeks the bands unraveled. The boys didn't even ware them to school, for fear of losing them.I've contacted zoobee, but haven't heard back."
4,Innovative Thinking??,"As much as this title is about strategy, in my opinion, it is also about being innovative and acting on innovation - what the author might call ""strategic thoughts"". If you are thinking about how to satisfy the future needs of customers, I think you would like this. It has a plenty of good information."
4,Ahead of the curve,common sence approach and the dashboard works very well on excel.It's great to sit and ponder the future and use the tools taught.
3,Ahead of the Curve,The book is a little simplistic. I would like to see more detail. I like the fact that it is not all about rising in the corporate world though.
1,Boring and Outdated,"This book was easy read, but the information was old and out dated. They were long winded and could have stopped at ch. 4."
4,Nice to SEE,I am so glad they did a doc film about this unsung hero who made the world award of Ira Hayes and the cultural genocide that America perpetuated against the indidgenous people of Turtle Island (America)!!!! I'd love to see a docudrama about his life! Most folks don't know he wrote five of the eight songs on Johnny Cash's Bitter Tears album! Peter was A.I.M. before it existed!
4,Tessie the Dragon,"My little one immediately fell in love with her and named her ""Tessie"". This toy is well-made and durable; she stands up well to being ridden (although I would not recommend that for older children)."
5,Keeps the monsters away,"We love this dragon. My little boy got it a few years ago, I think for his first birthday, and just recently started playing with it. The dragon sits by his bed at night to make sure ""The Ankle Grabber"" doesn't crawl up from under the bed. He loves ""flying"" around the house on it too. The dragon also likes to bite our dog, so we have to put him in time out sometimes :-)Who would have thought that a simple stuffed animal could be so much fun?"
5,Great price--great quality.,My granddaughter loved this! She had her eye on this at another store locally that was double the price. Granny got a good deal!
3,Returned it,"This dragon just wasn't as pliable and as cute as I thought it would be, so I returned it. It was rather stiff and not very movable."
4,Huge! Kids love the color and size! But it's not totally soft.,"Definitely catches a kid's attention when they open it! It's big (about 3' long, 1.5' high). The colors are great and it's not scary at all. My nephews spent a lot of time wrestling it and then they fought over it (ah, Christmas), so it has their approval. A 2-3yo can pretend to ride it, which is fun.But it's not totally plush and soft, which is what I expected. The wings are held in place by wire. It's not dangerous, because they're covered with a foam or fabric material, but I would have sacrificed these graceful wings that stick out nicely for something really soft and flexible. Also, the legs are pretty rigidly sewn in and held in place with a rigid fabric of some kind."
2,Defective,"Maybe it's just the one we ordered, but the metal wiring that give the wings structure popped out of their stitching within two weeks! I don't think my son was doing anything wild with it, just carry it around. It is very cute colorful, but this seems a design flaw."
1,big bummer,"I bought this Phoenix talking bathroom scale and from the beginning, it rarely gave me my accurate weight. Usually, 20lbs less (I wish!). I changed the battery and then it kept giving me about 15-20lbs less. I was not in town when it arrived, so I returned it after the 14 day ""guarantee."" I spent $12 to send it back and Magnifying Aids called me telling me I had to pay for return postage and they would send the defective scale for repair to the manufacturer, instead of sending me a new one. I told them to throw it in the garbage and hung up. BUMMER!!"
1,Didnt even work,"I got this as a gift for my mother, and we tried everything for this to work and it didnt even turn on! For as much as this cost for a scale I expected a lot more. Very disappointing!"
1,disappointment,"I would have returned this product if I hadn't destroyed the packaging. I cannot hear the weak voice and before I can get down and look at it, it is gone. I am in a wheelchair, so am very slow in getting to my feet and on the scale. This is by far the worst thing I have bought from Amazon. I use Amazon a lot because of their integrity in standing behind their products. I have never been disappointed before, but will be more careful with packaging from now on. I would have given no stars if that had worked."
3,Talking bathroom scale,"This product has worked good, so far. The product itself seems to have been put together a bit shabby, however, some days she's in a good mood, other days not so good."
3,Good Concept But Voice Weak,"Recorded voice is not as clear as it could be. Able to understand but not as sharp & crisp as the voice on higer quality items, such as GPS units. Overall, it does what it said it did."
1,horrid,"I thought I'd like this because i liked supersize me, but this is really lousy.... except at the end when a canteloupe has sex with a banana, that's cute."
1,This movie is a total waste,"I can appreciate the lesson that this movie was trying to teach but it was a complete waste of time. It was not funny. The acting and the cinematography was poor. The special features were boring. If want to see an entertaining and informative DVD on the subject of obesity, ""Super Size Me"" is the one to see."
1,Filthy Dirty!!,"This was un-rated, and now I know why. It is filthy in several places and unfit for younger children. It is funny at places but the filth ruins all that."
4,Muffin Man,"This is a weird, unconventional independent film. It is thought provoking, if you allow it to be. Muffin Man takes a bizarre, hilarious, bold and even eerie look at the obesity epidemic. Be warned: Go into it without expectations and you will be in for a surprise! Michelle Porras is brilliant and a natural beauty. Too bad she is not in more films. Steve Hodgson played his role very well. He was really very funny playing the role of the Mom."
4,Love That Music!,"Muffin Man is intelligent, articulate, provocative and highly entertaining. At the same time it's a disturbing picture of the potential future of mankind. It's worth your time and consideration. We particularly enjoyed the music. Pay careful attention to the lyrics!"
5,Loving my dog,"My old dog has always had digestion problems. Now that she is 12 it has become an issue! After trying many types of food to help her, I tried Dr. Harvey's Canine Health. She loves it and what's great is that she doesn't have the multitude of problems associated with poor intentinal health like she used to. No more gurgling stomach and vomiting! My friend has a little Rottwieler puppy that had bad kidneys. The vet said she would die soon. We went into action and discoverd that Dr. Harvey's food is actually easy on her kidneys. She has gained 12 pounds in less than 2 months which is a miracle. She is playing again and getting very sassy! I will keep my girl eating what she loves; Dr. Harvey's. I tried a bite myself and with a little salt and pepper, I could eat it too!"
1,Who thought up this disaster?,"Personally, I saw this film in the theater, and I have *NO* intentions of buying it on DVD, even though I have pretty much every DVD that ever came out for both the original anime, the first movie and Brotherhood, not to mention the manga. This movie was such a let-down and really did not fit in with any of the series. It was hardly about Ed & Al at all, and Mustang and his group were almost not in it. It could have been an episode of any anime, because it really was FMA in name only. I can't believe I was actually longing for humunculi, or *anything* to make it feel more like FMA to me. Amazingly bloody, ridiculously convoluted plotline, original characters that kept popping out of the woodworks that I couldn't have cared less about. As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to pretend this movie never happened!"
2,Boring,"This movie has none of the elements that made Full Metal Alchemist great. It has no philosophical depth, shallow characters and the plot is nowhere near as interesting as the TV series and reveals nothing new about the story. The CGI is impressive at times and there are some surprising plot twists but the ending is underwhelming. I bought every Full Metal Alchemist DVD/Blu-Ray made but I am not buying this one."
2,Missed Opportunity,"I was really disappointed in the movie when I saw it in theaters. It doesn't fit into the storyline of FMA: Brotherhood at all... In deciding to make an FMA: Brotherhood feature length movie, there was some serious potential for making a badass, excellent addition to the anime. Instead of adding more to the FMA: Brotherhood storyline, they go completely off on a tangent for this one, with a storyline that is 100% unrelated to the anime. I had about a million ideas of awesome things that could have been done with this movie, perhaps involving Xing and alkahestry, as those were relatively unexplored in the anime, but still had a central role in the storyline. Any of seemingly infinite possibilities of awesomeness existed, but whoever thought this was the best route to go was defintely off their rocker."
1,boring..really,"I recently saw this and fell asleep. I have all the FMA manga and have seen all the episodes of both series and the first movie. This movie is mainly about characters you've never heard of before and end up not caring about. Does not give additional insight to any of the regular FMA characters, some of whom barely make an appearance and might as well have been cut out altogether."
1,WORST FMA MOVIE,"I have to agree on one of the reviews below, this was the worst movie, it doesn't have any action on it, it just dont have anything, some people say it has to much violence, or that it is very bloody, but i was very disappointed of it"
5,Good companion to Brotherhood,This is a great adition to Brotherhood. Dont miss out on this film its a great film Like Brotherhood its full of action and adventure.
3,Not like the rest of the series..,I felt like this movie deviated a lot from the Brotherhood & the original Fullmetal. The story line was okay but the graphics seemed to be very different from the last ones.. It felt like it had some Hayao Miyazaki inspiration and didn't really feel like I was watching the Fullmetal series continuation/sub plot. I would only recommend it to hardcore fans. The change in graphics definitely made it harder to get in to.
4,Another awesome addition.,"Yet another awesome addition to the FMA story. I won't tell you the storyline or give anything away, but anyone who enjoys the manga or anime will also love this movie. I gave it 4 stars due to the fact i thought it lacked the normal amount of action previously seen in the manga/anime. :)"
3,Art Style??!!,"The movie is not bad by all means, But the art style is just completely sloppy. Edward barely looks like himself. They put this movie together fast making lines sloppy, less detailed."
5,Fullmetal for life!,This movie was great!!!!! It gave me butterflies and kept me guessing!!!! I give The sacred star of Milos a 11 out of 10!!!! I hope there is more fullmetal shows to come!
5,fma for the rule,"I was really surpriesed when i watched this. I thought it would be just like the series, buty the animation style was different enough that i enjoyed this individually. The story line is up there with the anime series, even though this is stand alone. I will point out that some scneses and content are more graphic than what you usually expect from fma, but if you watched the series and liked it, you'll like this movie. I recomand."
3,DVD s in tin bin,"OK subjects,but seem to be from aTV series, Tracks Ahead. So if you saw Tracks Ahead, you might be seeing duplicate series"
5,Great golf gambling tips,"Of course, none of us would ever or has ever bet on a round of golf .... but if you were to say play for something (bragging rights perhaps), this book is the key to victory. Not only does the aothor cover all sorts of golf gambling games (traditional and some quite obscure), but he also offers a detailed analysis and strategies of these games in great anecdotal style. Truly a great read that any serious golfer would enjoy."
5,A Treasure that Doesn't Grow Old,"I had this book as a child and loved it, reading and re-reading it many times over. Growing up in the 1950's, in a small town that was all white, I didn't at first understand what the author was talking about until my parents explained to me about racial predudice. I loved the character of April and loved her family, and that was enough for me to begin to learn to question the attitude of white racial superiority that permeated everything in America at that time.Marguerite di Angeli is a wonderful children's author - all of her stories are well-written, beautifully illustrated by the author, optimistic, and full of heart. It is a pity that books like these ever go out of print, because they never lose their value, and in fact seem to improve with age. Buy this book for your child and talk about the issues that it raises. Sadly, these issues are still living in America today."
4,A Sabretooth on the side of Angels,"The current leader of the New Exiles and the only true hero version of Sabretooth - every other dimensional version was a psychotic, backstabbing killer. In the Age of Apocalypse comic books he's sometimes depicted wearing a cape/cloak. Personally I would have prefered if this one had one because that looks really cool.Contrary to the review above - which sounds like a factory defect which should have been returned to the store (Which happens to all toys) - the fingers and articulation is in fact excellent as each finger individually flexes at the knuckles - except for the thumbs. At first glance it looks like a rebuild of the Wonder Man figure, but with larger arms and a fine snarling face. His pony-tail is also articulated and you can spin it around.He poses well with a figurine from the short lived series from Marvel for the Age of Apocalypse ""Marvel's Most Wanted: Blink - with teleporter base."""
1,SABRA-Idon'tgivea-TOOT! about this toy!,First off..This figure looks AWFUL! His skin is golden brown and he is bulky up top. Next is the fact he had gloves on most of the time and used a chain.Toy Biz made a AOA Sabretooth with a AOA Wild Child back in the day. Sad thing is that figure actually looked WAY better!The only reason I bought this and the melted head waste of money is for the Giantman parts.
2,Sabretooth without Fingers,"I am not thrilled with this product. It did not last through Christmas day. The fingers kept coming off. What kind of action figure loses his fingers in every battle? Needless to say, he is the last figure chosen when the battle is on! This may also be a choking hazard for small children."
4,worked fine for us,"These lights are the typical 12 volt in a lot of RV's. Our originals had gotten brittle, and sindged the cover on one. These were less expensive than most RV stores, and of course, Amazon delivered them on time and well with our Prime membership. Just run 2 12v wires, butt connect, and screw them in. The on/off switch allows 1 or 2 lights on (included), but don't be too rough with it. these lights are not any sturdier than the old ones. Good deal for the money spent."
5,Happy to have these lights!,"They look so nice and clean when they are new! Put out ample light. If I were to go off the grid I would probably get leds, but I am not. Perfect fit."
4,Don De Esta,About the album recorded in the laundry room. I got the single of it.The song Don De Esta.It was written by Dizzy Lee Roth
1,Royal Blend is definitely an overstatement!!,"I purchased this rice shortly after Amazon starting selling groceries. Was pleased to find a product where I could make as much as I wanted for my growing boys. Looked very similar to the rice and beans I was purchasing from the grocery store, also had similar cooking instructions so I thought good deal! Boy was I wrong! This stuff has absolutely no flavor! It is probably one of the worse side dishes I have ever tasted. We added flavoring to it and it really didn't help. We have since thrown out all of the RiceSelect red beans we purchased. Save your money and tastebuds, buy Zatarains or Vigo red rice and beans, they have flavor-this does NOT~!"
5,My daughter loves this!,My 4 year old daughter loves this rice and bean mixture. I cook it in the rice cooker and she eats every last bit of it. Great product esp. if you don't want all the sodium that many other brands have in them.
5,How did I get by without this,No more leaving cash and passport exposed in a hotel room Worked like a charm. I attached it to a pipe in the shower. Bingo no worries.
3,too big,"I bought this product to use when I go backpacking around the world. I planned to use it to lock up things like money and passport in my room when I go out. The picture was deceiving to me, and it is actually big enough to hold much more. This may be a positive for some people, but because the product is a heavy one, I really hoped it would be a small, easy to carry size, to hold the bare essentials. I'm sure it works fine, but Pacsafe doesn't appear to make anything in a small size, like I am looking for."
4,solid buy,This is nice and handy. I wanted something that would be easy to use and effective.TABPacSafe Travel Accessories TravelSafe 100 Secure Portable Safe
4,Surprising Revelations About Screenwriting,"""Tales from the Script"" provides an interesting inside-out view of the world of screenwriting. In this minimalist documentary, Peter Hanson and Paul Robert Herman have uncovered some amazing gems of wisdom from the best screenwriters in the industry. The movie version breathes additional life into the material that is covered by the book version. Many of the interviews that Hanson and Herman gathered are quite funny. It's fascinating to hear the writers describe the bizarre stories of how their work found its way to the big screen. There are a bunch of unbelievable true stories here that you won't find anywhere else.""Tales from the Script"" is a must-see for anyone that aspires to be a screenwriter!"
5,Interesting movie of interviews with screenwriters,"This movie version of Tales from the Script by Peter Hanson and Paul Herman was very entertaining. I really liked the book, but I wasn't sure how a movie of interviews would be. I was pleasantly surprised! Thanks to the excellent job they did editing the interviews together, the movie flowed really well. I enjoyed seeing the screenwriters who have written some of my favorite movies. It was also really interesting to see the writers describe the process of making a movie. I recommend this movie to film geeks, writers, or anyone interested in film making."
4,Mixed Bag,"Some of the successful writers in this DVD got an early break.Other writers wrote for years before being recognized. In somerespect the stories can be discouraging, yet, there are such a varietyof writers featured that you realize, it takes all kinds. More importantly,you have to be drawn to writing and love the process..."
3,A Slight Disappointment...,"This is the Japanese SHM Import that Costs $40+. I must say, that the mini LP Casing is superb. So you would think that the remastering on the CD would be the 'holy grail sonics' of this classic album. Well, upon listening to it, it does have a clarity and ""openess"" that previous CD releases didn't have. But i noticed 2 things....1, Stevie's vocal track is distorted on some tracks, (especially noticeable on track 8) ..and 2, i had to struggle to hear James Jamerson's Basslines at times. In Fairness, maybe the vocal distortion was 'always' there, but due to this modern remastering, it made that aspect more noticeable,... but i always recall James Jamerson's Bass lines a little more prominent in the mix. Overall, I'm not totally bashing this release, other than the issues mentioned, this Release has really good sonics (clarity). I just wish that for $40+,.. the vocal distortion issues were addressed, & the original mix was respected a little more..."
5,one of his best,"I think ""For once in my life"" is one of the best Stevie Wonder album; it's full of great songs, and I love them all; together with ""My cherie amour"" is the best Wonder's album on the '60"
2,"Great Music, Lousy Mastering","This disc has very limited dynamic range not just for a jazz disc, but for any type of disc. Further, there is a fair amount of clipping during the more intense parts which is disappointing because Vu is one of my favs. It is the current practice to raise the average volume of music to as close as possible to maximum so it sounds louder to a listener and music people think that this will get peoples attention. But the processes used are damaging to the sound quality and leads to listening fatigue. Besides, most people know how to work the volume knob (or replaygain/etc) so when something is markedly louder than what was before, people either skip it or turn down the volume.Google loudness war for more info. It is a shame that this horrible practice is making such huge inroads into jazz...way to alienate fans jazz guys.4.5 star music0 star mastering"
3,"Package has a big American flag on it, but don't be fooled.","I'm guessing the metal and the rubber was glued together in a US factory, but in little tiny letters on the rubber handle, it says ""Molded in Taiwan"". This is a chinese tool advertising as one made in the USA. Go figure. I hate deceptive advertising, especially when it comes to my hand tools (I only buy American whenever possible). I'm giving these hooks 3 stars because they'll do the job, but I'm docking 2 stars due to Mayhew's painfully obvious practice of using deception in their packaging. Drop the US flag, Mayhew, you haven't earned the right to put it on your product."
4,Challenging,"I have just finished a class with the book as its main textbook. The book is well written, but you honestly have to work through each page with pen and paper in hand filling in the omitted steps. Nothing is spoon-fed to you. The exercises are very challenging while the problems develop small theories. If you work through the pain and sweat through the exercises, you will at the end of the book greatly improve your skills and intuition.The author Stein is a leader in his field and has provided plenty of depth and breadth. This also means that he is on a different level and an argument that he calls ""simple"" has quite often taken me two pages to justify. However, if you put in the effort it will pay off tenfold."
5,excellent,"I took many semesters of analysis in college as a math major, and I think I learned more useful knowledge from this book than from all those classes. Of course the classes helped prepare me to absorb what's in the book, but still it seems to me that the book strikes a good balance between generality and comprehensibility. Many of the books I used in school were too focussed on proving the most general version of every theorem, and failed to provide motivation or useful experience with the objects which the theorems actually describe. By taking fourier series as the motivating idea, the authors capture the historical spirit of the subject as well as that aspect of it which students are most likely to use in real work."
5,Nice book so far,"I still have not read anything after chapter two, but the book look nice so far. It has a somewhat different approach by trying to avoid measure theory and still making a few comments on it for those who have already studied."
5,great boots,great boots i ordered because of the color. they really get noticed. all steel toes seem to hurt my feet a little but less than any other steel toe boots i have ever worn
4,CIA Secrets Revealed,"Horrors!I bought this book on a whim at a bricks and mortarretailer. It is beautiful, and I was caught in a moment of weakness.Now, having lived with it for several days, I'm online to send it as agift to my brother and sister ...I had recently read The Making ofA Chef (look up the author yourself) which is about the experience ofa writer enrolled in the Culinary Institue of America(""CIA""). I found that book lively and engaging though therecipes more than a bit cryptic. Hence my enthusiasm for a wellorganized cook book with all the details the journalist(appropriately) left out.As for its true worth as a cookingcompanion, the dozen vinagrettes alone seem enough to justify thecost...."
5,Extremely cute,"My six year old son and I loved this book. It has irony that parents will smile at, and cute situations a kid will love. It compares the duties of a teacher to the president (quite favorably!) and is very funny and fun.Highly recommended! Even if you didn't vote for the current president."
1,Never in Stock,This items needs to be taken off the site. Ordered it last week and then received multiple e-mails from the supplier that they had it and then they didn't have it but would be available in a few days. Got an e-mail today telling me the order is cancelled because the item is not available. A big waste of time.
4,Good Introduction to the Rosary,"I recommend this short introduction to the Rosary. Liz Kelly has written an outstanding guide book on the Rosary. Let me say this, before I read this book, my knowledge of the Rosary was limited at best. However, after reading this book, I can now say that I not only understand the Rosary, but appreciate it.""The Catechism calls the rosary the ""epitome of the whole Gospel"". Why? It is scriptural meditation; thirteen of the fifteen mysteries, or meditations, are drawn directly from the New Testament. The Rosary works on multiple levels: it is a physical object; it involves the intellect and the imagination in mediation; and its purpose is developing spiritual insight and ultimately, connection with God."""
3,Alright,Took to long to get to me and it arrived after the date I was suppose to receive it but it is good but with some ripped pages
4,I feel sleepy... still have to waltz,"There is no doubt that in the sleepy land of slowcore Low reign supreme... So the question to ask is not whether you'll like this record or not but whether you like slowcore. If the answer is yes then just buy anything whith this band's name on it, you won't be disappointed!As for those who don't know what slowcore really is about I'll say that it's a minimal, skeletal say some, form of music. Don't expect fast-paced rhythms, the tone is ""low"" and the melodies linger forever. Something you'll actually wonder whether someone is actually playing...""One more reason to forget"" is a superb live album which was recorded in a church. It might be a good entry point if you aren't familiar with the band!"
4,Good Pedals,"Just received these pedals today. Seem like a very good product and much sturdier than what were on the bike when I bought it. Only problem I see with them are the bearings seem very, gravely for lack of a better term. I'm going to try them out and see if I can take them apart and grease them before I pass judgement."
4,Fighting Terrorism,Informed assessment. Excellent recommendations. Great read. A must for anyone truly interested in stopping the terrorists.
5,"Intelligent read, but sad","I am in the midst of this book and am enthralled by it. Benjamin Netanyahu is an intelligent, well educated man who clearly knows that which he writes about. He knows what needs to be done with terrorism because he lives with it. However this book makes me sad. It's barely been three years since September 11th and we have gotten so involved in pointing fingers at one particular person or one particular ideology that we have forgotten the point. I do not know that America and the rest of the ""developed world"" will ever deal adequately with the threat that terrorists pose because we as a society do not want to know that others view us as less than human. This book points out that terrorism cannot be justified because it is evil. If only we would remember that. READ THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Fighting Terrorism,"Another piece of trash, good to line bird cages with. What about the terrorism practised against the Palestinian people? I call that ethnic cleansing. Do not waste your money."
4,A good Start,"Mr netanyahu gives a broad overview of all types of terrorism around us, even those that can be categorized differently.Mr netanyahu long experience fighting terrorism (politically and military) totally shows in this book."
2,No way is this book for 9 year olds,"""Mikey was talking about English girls being all hot to trot for American guys.""""Bobby Joe could not get to first base with any girl I know for two reasons.""""Somebody ahead of me screamed and I saw his body go straight back and his arms fly into the air. There was a spray of blood and I knew he was hit bad.""""Two guys were hit by sniper fire. One died. Our guys killed the sniper. He was a kid. A Nazi kid.""""Half his face just blew away.""""When men are wounded you can smell the blood and the gases coming from them. We got the order to move out and we had to run through the smoke and the bodies of the men from Charlie Company.""""I could hear it. I could hear the bullets hit them. The first two guys in the column went down, one quietly and one screaming.""Americans grimly executing surrendered Germans, the smells of rotting corpses, too much blasphemy. Parents should pre-read."
5,Best Ever,If you like action you will like this a lot. It's about a man named Scott Pendleton Collins who fights in world war 2. I read it four times.
4,The Journal of Scott Pendleton Collins: A World War II Soldier,"My 9 year old, 4th grader, recently read The Journal of Scott Pendleton Collins for a book report. He is not much on reading, and it is difficult to find books that hold his attention. The book, although a little sad, was exiting and interesting. He really enjoyed it and did a great job on the book report!"
5,Incredible and Amazing in Deatail,"This book is about a 17 year old boy in the middle of WWII. Hefinds himself in one of the worst battles in the war. He must fightin the now famouse D-day battle. He lands one the baech and must fight through the watter. All the while watching people infront beside and behind him be killed or wounded. This book is a reminder of how bad war rally is. The horror this boy must face to make it through. This book has great deatail, but not too much of it. I am a 12 year old boy and am reading this book for the third time, still finding things i had missed or forgotten before. I really loved this book. I recommend it for readers of all ages. A trully Amazing book."
5,Best Media I can find,"I've burned over 3000 discs this year using this media (purchased direct from Media Supply) and have had less than 10 failures. No complaints about a disc not playing, either.Incidentally I buy the value line, so theoretically these (the premium line) should be even better.When I have used other media out of necessity, my fail rate is 3-5% depending on the brand.Nuff said."
4,Good but not Printable,"These discs were good but not printable. I have to write on these discs and half the time my writing iike doctors hand writing so that only I can read it. I have terrible penmanship skills, which is why I wanted the printable discs."
1,Apparently something has changed at TY,"Almost all of the 100 discs on the spindle I got skipped and showed pixelation for projects that work perfectly with other discs. I'm using multiple burners and mulitple players. My projects are simple videos < 1hr burned at < 8000kbps constant bit rate. Again, these projects work fine as long as I don't use TY discs. Given all the positive reviews, I obviously got a bad batch. Perhaps they are fake, but the MID shows them to be Taiyo Yuden. Perhaps TY has changed their manufacturing and are shipping garbage. I really don't know, but I'm not ordering their discs ever again."
1,BAD!,"Stay way from these. TY has two levels, one made in Japan (premium) and other in Korea. Blurb indicates these are the premium brand but they are junk.They have a film on them. If I wash the disc, I can get my DV-F07 to play them but none of my three Sony jukes can read them. Even my DV-393S (think it could play a manhole cover) chatters a bit at the start.Bought these in August, wish I had started using them immediately. They would have been returned."
5,Fantastic,"I've been using these DVDs for several years now, and this is just my latest order. When I combine these DVDs with an actual label, it creates a product that lasts virtually indefinitely. I haven't had a problem with a single disc."
4,good,I bought these for my son to burn his homemade movies on had only one complaint and that was that he couldnt write on them. He was worried that a Sharpie would ruin the disc. A plus was that these came with their own case! Thank goodness.
2,Had some problems,"In my second hundred lot of TY 8X DVD-Rs I encountered playback errors in the DVD videos made from them. [I had gotten good results from my first hundred lot.] Initially unsure if it was the media, my DVD player, or my burner, I finally bought some Verbatim disks and my difficulties disappeared. I had to conclude that the TYs were at fault and I have not used them since.Bear in mind that I may have been unlucky; I did have good results from the first hundred lot I purchased and they are very reasonably priced. It remains possible that my burner is substandard. I do not buy TY any more, however."
2,Wrong region code !!!,"I had burned about 20 disc (archival for DVD player) before I tried one of them in a DVD player, rather than my computer. Unfortunately, it would not play in any of the 3 players I tried, each of which was a different manufacturer. I had used too many to try returning them at that point. Burn rate was 100%(2 stars for that), no coasters at all, but my purpose was not served."
1,Not Impressed,"Decided to give these a try, due to all the favorable reviews. First disk out of the box was a dud. That's enough for me to never want to buy them again."
4,Dinosuars Rule!,"This game is Awsome! When your a raptor you get slice and eat all the humans and other dios! Ha! As T-Rex hardly anything stands in your way. Eat all the Humans! They did a great job on the dinos and made it really fun. But Darn it, why is their no check points!?!? Trust me, you'll want to get this game! Have fun as the dinos! Smell you later!"
5,Human extinction...,"I played this game a long time ago, but I remember loving it. A few suggestions out of my experience for you. One: you should use the cheats to play the velociraptor, it is extensivly gory and violent, but its fun. Two: do NOT play the human prey level. It is incredibly difficult and very stupid. Finally, the T. Rex level is only fun on levels when you can eat the humans. all other T. Rex levels are ludicrisly difficult and seemingly impossible. My only other suggestion is, don't get to caught up with the difficultly aspect, but concentrate on the best part: YOU HAVE THE UPPER HAND! KILL THOSE PATHETIC HUMANS!"
2,great fun game but cant save!,i love this game its soooo fun BUT you work so hard and get so far and i have not found where you can save the game. maybe there's a way but I haven't found it and that just ruins it!
4,Review for Jurassic Park: Lost World,I really love this game! It's 3D graphics and dinosaur realism make you feel like your inside the game. It's a game of survival and skill and it's really great and fun! Jurassic Park:Lost World is a real treat and it makes a great Christmas gift!
2,The book for someone want to know MicroStation,"You can find most of the content of this book in help file of MicroStation. This book is extremely basic. It doesn't get any topic too deep. If you are looking for an solution, this book won't work. This book is for someone who learns MicroStation for fun."
1,Waste of Time,"This is a poorly written ""guide"", and it is a waste of time and money for anyone who really wants to understand MicroStation. It is incredible how weak this ""guide"" is; Evident after only a few pages is the fact that the author was merely slapping together a book for her students without much knowledge of the software application! If you have money to burn and time to waste while waiting for a REAL guide to MicroStation, then go ahead....otherwise skip this and just read the software's help files!"
2,All basting brushes are NOT alike!,"A basting brush is a basting brush, right?Wrong.The sauce or butter or marinade has to actually stay on the brush long enough to get it on the food!After searching and researching I decided to give silicone brushes a try, against that little voice in my head that kept telling me... No!I should have listened to the little voice! I really did have high hopes for this brush, but it just doesn't hold the liquids in order to use them. I tried olive oil, melted butter, Italian dressing (that was supposed to go on steaks), but the liquids just were not staying on the brush long enough to be put on the foods. Yes, I could have just poured it on and used brush for that (I did that for the steaks), but why should I have to waste extra sauce (or whatever) by pouring, if the brush should work? I shouldn't and I won't.I wound up just using a paper towel folded over. Back to regular brushes for me. :o("
1,Bad condition,The product was covered full of dust as if it was lying in stock for years. They dont even take trouble to wipe dust off.eeks ... I paid for this product ???I will never buy or suggest to buy this product
3,Not the best,"I bought this to replace one that had been chewed by critters. I was disappointed. This brush does not hold the basting liquid in sufficient quantity to do the job. The bristles are much too large and too few to work effectively. Go for a brush with more, and smaller bristles and you'll be much happier. I doubt that Mario has even used this."
5,The perfect item....,....that you didn't know you needed. Saw one of these at a friend's house and realized that having a basting brush that never gets clean and leaves pieces of itself all over the food is not the way that life has to be.
2,"Easy to clean, but lacks the texture to hold some liquids.","The Mario Batali Silicone brush is mediocre at best, there are some good points about it, and some bad, I'll list them below.Pros -Dishwasher safe.Handle is covered in a nice rubber coating, allowing you to grip it with a oven mitt on, or even when your hands are coated in oil or sauce.The silicone brush is wide and the base of the bristles is molded solid, making it easy to clean and sanitize.Cons -The bristles are shaped like scoops, flimsy, and are too smooth in texture to hold onto a decent amount of liquids. You'll find yourself trying to scoop up bbq sauce or heavier liquids with little or no luck. This means you'll be basting a lot longer, and that can be a big problem when working around a hot oven. Often I'll simply opt for a regular brush around a grill or oven, saving this silicone one for pre-basting."
3,s0-s0,"My son enjoys most of this movie because it's animated people in space. it's too confusing for him to learn much from, though. there's too much going on visually. for example, there are two words onscreen when they're trying to teach a word. There are three boxes of activity onscreen at a time during parts of the show. too confusing for my 4 year old, but entertaining. instills enthusiasm for learning words."
3,My son loves it- even if he isn't learning his sight words...,"I really want to give this a better review. It is one of the more captivating educational videos out there, but it's definitely more ""captivating"" than ""educational."" The songs are so catchy and the characters are so lively that the words sort of fade into the background. Often there are two or three words on the screen, making it confusing to tell which word is which. The words my son learned the easiest were actually spelled out in songs. Some of the visuals seem more appropriate for infants who need to learn the MEANING of common words, as opposed to the spelling (Look, See, Find is a song where the characters actively look for a cat, acting out looking, seeing, and finding. errrm... sight words, people. That's what we're supposed to be doing here.) Overall, making the words visible for beginning readers seems to come second to goofy cartoon characters."
2,Not what I thought,Not real easy for the kids to learn to animated and not interesting for them. Not happy for the price it cost.
1,To Be Considered,This product uses a ladies stocking as the filtering element. There is another product that uses a metal screen as the filter and is much easier to clean.The filtering element style is not described in the product advertising.
5,Military Knives: A Reference Book,"This book is awesome! I'm a custom knife designer, and I use it as a reference all the time. If you're into military knives, you'll love this book. Lots of pictures and facts."
5,A must have book.,Excellent book. Highly recommended for anyone interested in military knives.The only negative point is the black and white photographs of knives.
1,"""Earth Final Conflict's History re-written""","This book was very bad. I always have a problem when authors go back in the history of a story line without knowing what the show is all about. The author of this book doesn't watch EFC, or if he does it is a different show than I watch. He brings in things that are totally wrong, I did not like this book and will not buy the other ones when they come out."
1,A must read - for insomniacs! A Major Yawn!,"What a disappointment! After eagerlay awaiting the first EFC book and having to have it 'hot off the press', after only a few chapters I wondered why I bothered. The author began the story with gusto then became mired in the most boring trivia, going on ad nauseum for over a hundred pages where nothing more happened than Doors slept / tried to find food / got lost / found his way again and had some terrible visions. The inaccuracies with the storyline were a glaring embarrassment. One could have forgiven those errors if the story had been rivetting enough to hold a reader's attention. The only saving grace, I really liked the dust cover. Please Mr. Saberhagen do your homework before you attempt another novel. It makes for excellent bedtime reading ... for an insomniac."
2,For the MONEY?!!,"I've probably read over a million pages of Sci-Fi in my 49 years,including just about every word written by Heinlein and Clarke. I haven't read much by Saberhagen, but I'll bet he spends more time and effort on his own material.AS a dyed in the wool E:FC Fan, this is a real stinker that drags all the way through and has none of the appeal and action of the T.V. series. Maybe the teen set love it because it's something from the show, but, in my opinion, the publishers waisted their money,because it seems that is all Mr.Saberhagen was interested in. I'd almost bet that he hadn't even read the E:FC ""Bible""."
2,"And if you really like the word ""and"" you'll love this book.","And I thought this book was really disappointing. And instead of being about how the Taelons came to Earth and it's mostly about Doors father in the 1930's. And there's more about Errol Flynn fooling around with David Niven than anything with Taelons. And Lilly Marguette is on the cover and she's not even in the book. And the author started so many sentences with ""and"". And it was really annoying, considering I don't think you're supposed to start a sentence with ""and"". And it got so bad, I couldn't help thinking every sentence started with ""and""."
3,Hard to get into,I am a big fan of Earth Final Conflict and I was looking forward to the book but I got a little bored with it. It seems to drag on in sections but its a good book. I recommend it if you are a fan of the series.
2,"A light review of tendencies, cultural climates and so on","A light review of tendencies, cultural climates and so on about regionalism in Europe. A brief show of erudition, useful for scholars for references and suggestions, but not supported by strong reasoning."
2,Try a different book,"This is a typical Anglo-American discussion of Descartes as if he were a 20th-century analytic philosopher-- of course he was not. The author trots out most of the standard ""refutations"" of Cartesian philosophy (some in less than a page) so that anyone approaching Descartes for the first time may wonder why he was ever thought to be an important philosopher.The whole book looks like it was thrown together in a week: there are numerous errors in layout and typesetting, and the text itself is more of a hasty sketch than a coherent analysis. (The editors must have been asleep.)If you are looking for a good introduction to Descartes, try a different book-- or better yet take the time to read Descartes's own words. The ""Meditations"" is a short work, and most translations include a helpful introduction. It will be well worth the time and effort!"
4,An approachable introduction,"Like other books in this Wadsworth series, this provides a relatively quick overview of Descartes, both the historical circumstances of his life and times, and his philosophy. In the limited scope defined for the book, the basic themese and issues are introduced and treated in a way that helps the reader to understand the significance of Descartes' ideas, as well as to see these ideas in the context of wider debate. The logic of Descartes thinking is given significant attention. My students find Descartes actual writings daunting, but I believe a work like this not only helps open up those works, but hopefully encourages the reader to pick up those works themselves. The book could have been better edited!"
3,Take what is useful and disregard the rest,"There are some thought-provoking areas which could be helpful. However, the book contained more intellectualization rather than insight, and at times, served as a platform for the author to showcase his achievements and knowledge. Prager makes several bold statements and generalizations regarding religion, relationships, and life in general, which I did not agree with. Especially with his opinion that ALL men are constantly battling their insatiable lust to be with other women. But like I mentioned, some of the concepts and perspectives are helpful. I just take what is useful and disregard the rest."
4,how can you not like it,"As I read the few negative reviews of this book, the critics all seem to be commenting about Dennis the radio talk show host (whom they may disagree with on some political issue or another), not the contents of this book. The weakness of the book: It is based on common sense and not backed up by thousands of clinical studies to verify up each and every claim; thus at times, it seems a little surface and simplistic. The strength of this book: It is based on common sense and not backed up by thousands of clinical studies to verify up each and every claim; thus it is void of a thousand qualifying ""but sometimes..."" and instead is simple, clear and to the point. Just as we say, on reading an insightful movie review, ""that makes perfect sense; that's exactly what I've always felt but just didn't know how to put it into words quite so clearly,"" so most people will say after reading each chapter: Yes, exactly, someone's finally put it into words! Congratulations, Dennis."
5,"You Must Define Happiness, Through Your Own Soul Search","I read this book twice last month, and once last year. I wrote so much in the margins, and on any piece of paper that I could get my hands on. I felt as though I was a kindred spirit with the author. And, I especially enjoyed his anticipation of religious people's argument against personal growth. I know that I will read this book again, between other books, especially after I read novels that contain emotional pain. Reading this book, has guided me to heal many old wounds, and to demand of myself to let go of past unmet expectations. It also has me more open to study religion, from an historial and social side."
4,Happiness is a serious problem SOLVER,"This book was a shot of B12 to my soul....a refreshing relief from ""blame and shame"" self help books that invite the reader to drag their stuff through paralyzing analysis until the clutter is overwhelming. Personal responsibility. Simplicity. But not an over-simplification of life. Just real healthy revelation in reader friendly format...short, succinct meaty chapters(1-2 pages) that help you eat the elephant one bite at a time. Nice."
2,There are better books out there,"Mr. Prager hits many problems about happiness on the head. He says that people shouldn't demand unconditional love, shouldn't have unrealistic expectations, and his general point seems to be that people should (must) work for their happiness.Actually, his point about holding no expectations was actually the most interesting part of the book. But, this book does not do the ""problem of happiness"" much justice. Prager fails to realize that there are millions of people unlike him who are happy people, many people do not find happiness in the way he has decreed as the only ""true"" way possible. Prager's arrogant claims that a secular family can't really be grateful for anything and that divine retribution leads to human happiness are just plain childish and untrue.For a better treatment of happiness, read ""The Conquest of Happiness"" by Bertrand Russell"
5,Fantastic yet common-sensical insights; universal themes,"I have been on a mission to share this gem with all of my family and friends (so far, I've purchased this book 5 times as gifts and recommended it to at least 15 friends). Dennis Prager has produced a truly valuable book that, when properly digested, can lead to tremendous personal growth. I'm a fan!"
4,Some good advice if you can deal with it.,"I read this book this past winter and it has really helped me to accomplish many items on my 2001 resolutions list. How? By following the rule to have no expectations. When you have a positive goal and you don't allow ""what if"" to hinder your success before you even start, it's amazing what you can accomplish.As with any self help book, I can see why one person would give it 5 stars and another person 1 star wishing it could be given 0 stars. It's all in the person really, what the person wants to get out of the book how well the reader can relate to what is being said. I can't in anyway predict what someone else might gain from reading it. But I'd highly recommend it, based on the personal growth I experienced."
4,Dennis Prager,"He has some interesting ideas about happiness, most, but not all, of which I agree with. I would recommend it to others."
3,There is a higher calling,"Interesting book, but there is a higher calling that Dennis needs to recognize.One of his books said that you do not need to believe in God, I think you do."
4,"Good read, not a life changer","Thought he did a good job discussing a current social problem we have. Everyone thinks they have a right to be happy or their goal is to be happy. Unfortunately, we have the right to PURSUE happiness, which the founders originally were going to say ""right to property"" rather than ""right to pursue happiness"" and this was probably a mistake on their part. ""Happy"" is based on the old English word ""hap"" which means luck. ""Happiness"" is a fleeting emotion. It comes and goes. From a religious perspective, we should be searching for ""joy"" or ""blessedness"" which is a permanent state of being and can exist whether we are happy or not, whether our situation is good or bad."
5,Holiday Favorites,"Each movie in this package is just great for the holidays or any other time you want to watch them. Hallmark Christmas movies are myfavorites this time of year. They are warm, realistic, feel good movies, make you grateful for what you have."
2,"Good stories, but not so good content","Not as ethical as I would of liked. They had good story lines, but wasn't pleased with the homosexuality portrayed or language used in the movies.I would not recommend for families."
2,Not your average Nomads,"As a long time fan of the Supper Club, Nomads brand. I find this slice of music luke warm. The selection of tracks considering the massive material submitted to the parent label United Recordings is weak. There is none of the cohesive spiritual vibe of the first, and best compilation. It is at best one DJ's taste, and his taste is limited. The mixing is average also, just not up to the usual standards for a Nomads CD. I'd suggest purchasingvolume 3 which features tracks from the Therapy Works imprint."
4,Very good coffee...love that it's organic and comes right to my door at a reasonable price!,"I'm a rather avid coffee drinker and have purchased many different brands over time. Though this is not quite as good as what we brought back ourselves from Costa Rica, both my husband and I really enjoy this coffee and have it shipped regularly. Overall good value."
3,hit or miss decaf beans,about 50% of the time the beans are bone dry and the flavor speaks for itself. I have told customer support and hopefully there will be a change. When the beans are fresh and oily this is a great coffee.
5,theme fun,"I once owned theme hospital and thoroughly enjoyed it... one of the most entertaining games I have played. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. When you play, time goes by incredibly fast which isn't a bad thing because it is such an addictive and fun game. Loved it and as a recent buyer of them hospital for the second time, I love it all over again. It is easy to pick up the rules and controls and is a progressing game therefore it's hard to get bored. What's best is any age would enjoy this game. For an older game with advanced and fun graphics, still to this day i rate this game 11/10"
1,Two Thumbs Way Down,"This game is very stupid and pointless. I wouldn't give it any stars if I could. This game is a waist of money, Heck they should be paying you. I give this game -5 stars hoping this review will help someone. That's not all the animation is bad and the plot is childish!"
1,Didn't work,"I live in a very wooded rural area and have problems with rabbits, squirrels and deer eating the plants in my yard. This stuff stinks really bad but that didn't bother the squirrels and deer. They were back munching away the next day. It seemed to work on the rabbits for a day or two then they were back too. When there is less food available I doubt it would have any effect at all on any animal. I tried using this in June so there was plenty of other food sources available. After I had purchase this I found it my local Lowes store for $19.99. So way overpriced and didn't have any effect on anything but rabbits and I think you would have to spray everyday to be effective on them."
3,It helps.but...,"I've used this product for a month now... and while it's definitely causing less rabbit activity in my yard, they're still around some. I think that because it's spring/summer time in So. Calif., we've got so many hungry young rabbits, that they will eat regardless of the Liquid Fence. I know it's helping, because I see much more activity on my neighbor's lawn. So, I may try the Dual Action Liquid Fence, which is supposed to help deter even hungry young rabbits."
5,Best Deer Repellent I've Ever Used,"The deer where we live are usually well behaved but sometimes browse and devour plants, bushes and new growth on trees around the house. It is self inflicted since we feed them corn in winter in one corner of the property in the woods. We just wanted to put something down to protect our yard after we stop feeding them in spring. Tried many repellents including home brews found on line and they did not last long at all. Found Liquid Fence at a local feed store and was told it would work, it sure does. The deer approach the yard, sniff, shake their heads and leave quickly. I bought the concentrate and used a sprayer and that worked very well. It did smell pretty bad for about 12 to 18 hours but after that we didn't smell it, but the deer still do. Good stuff, highly recommended."
1,Liquid Fence Stinks,"Literally...this product didn't work for me at all because if I sprayed it even I couldn't enjoy the patio garden. If you never visit your garden, if you never sit outside with friends - then maybe this is the product for you. But I live outdoors in the spring and summer and cannot imagine sitting next to that smell for 4+ months when grilling or just chilling."
4,"So far, so good","The deer only accasionally eat my plants. Since I used Liquid Fence, I have had no trouble, but it's way too early to know whether it works."
2,lost momentum,"'The Ironwood Tree' is the fourth book of 'The Spiderwick Chronicles'. Like the previous books 'The Ironwood Tree' has wonderful illustrations by Tony DiTerlizzi, however unlike the previous books it does not have a strong story to match. This volume finds the Grace kids undertaking adventures in an abandoned quarry after Mallory is kidnapped by Dwarves. The larger story loses a lot of momentum as this book doesn't really serve to advance the plot. In most books a side adventure like this wouldn't matter too much, but with the books being as short as they are this amounts to 20% of the whole story wasted on, frankly a lackluster, digression. Hopefully things will pick up for the last book."
4,going strong and holding the suspense...,"Well, I bought it the second day it was released and had it finished, in a few hours. That's the great thing if you have a few hours you've finished the book, that's also the sad thing... now I have to wait for book 5 til Sept.This series is fun and charming and exciting, regaurdless your age. I teach school and don't always make time for myself. These books are perfect fits into a hectic day and the small amounts of time I save for myself. Since that time is cherished I like making the most of it and Spiderwick books fit into my precious time ... so they have to be good for me, to recommend them.Grandma's do you want a fun read that is as exciting as Harry Potter, that will impress your grandkids and help them remember your activities, something you can do in a few short hours together. This is it!Excited Teacher in Nevada"
4,Not Up to the Last Two,"It's been two weeks since anything weird has happened to the Grace family. But all that changes on the day of the Mallory's fencing tournament. While watching from the bleachers, Jared spies someone going through Mallory's bag. Then Mallory disappears. Can Jared and Simon find her?This is the first book in the series I didn't recognize from the movie. But I can understand why the writers left it out. In many ways, it feels like a retread of book two with the missing sibling angle. About the only thing that happens to advance the overall story happens in the last few pages.Now this isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the book. The plot moved forward very quickly. Simon finally got a chance to shine here. The final scene was powerful. In fact, parents may want to preview it so they can talk to their kids about it.Even if this book isn't as strong as some of the others, it is still a good read that kids and fantasy lovers will enjoy."
2,A disappointment,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is an aspiring series for children with big imaginations. However, this book is a disappointment. I tried to read it with my kids as they love ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" but several parts left my youngest daughter with nightmares. None of the other books ever gave her dreams.If you like, you can skip this book and go cruising on to Book 5. You're not missing much."
3,"Not perfect, but still a great read","First of all, this is not a bad book. Not at all. It's good, but it has a few *noticeable* problems. It is, as you can tell from the spine, a very short book. In fact, I am reading the fifth book right now and I just started the series yesterday. This book can be read in just a little over 30 minutes.But don't get the wrong idea. I'm not saying it's bad. The plot seems rushed (as it does in the other books). It seems a little too easy for the characters to succeed. At one point, Simon decodes a message (it's never explained how he does it), and the message ends up as ""Knock Three Times To Enter"". And the fact that the rock quarry is a bit close to the school makes it seem all too simple.Everything else in the book is top-notch. Great characters, good plot. But as soon as you start, it's over."
2,Heavy-handed,"This reads less like a novel than sociology in the form of a novel, written to impress the reader with the author's knowledge of the Austrian alpine's social history."
2,Review,"I am finally near the end of the book; it was very difficult to follow. I usually love anything this author had written, but I must admit, this one wasn't one of my favorites."
3,Homestead,This book is interesting but lacks something in the fact that it moves too fast from one charactor to the next story. However I do recommend it as an enjoyable read.
5,"A Trip to the Zoo, on TV","I first discovered Baby Genius with my cable system's On Demand feature and my girl has loved it since she was only a handful of months old. She is 11 months now and still loves this series. This particular DVD is fast paced enough to keep her attention, and interesting enough to keep the adults in the room watching as well. You'll probably learn about some animals you had never seen before, too. Each section is set to classical music and includes a few visits from the Baby Genius characters, but not so much as to be annoying. One of the best moments is watching the mother hippo push her baby up to the surface of the water to get air. Hopefully someday we'll be able to make the trip to San Diego and see this wonderful zoo."
3,Get Baby Animals Fav. sing-a-longs instead,"Buy Baby Genius baby animals sing-a-longs- instead. I bought this and Baby Animals sing-a-longs and they both take place at the zoo, but the other has more music and my 20 month old likes it much better. This one plays classical music, so it is not as much fun."
3,Don't like the music,"My daughter loves animals, she loves to watch Baby Genius ""At The Zoo"" from YouTube, she smiles whenever hear the song. So I bought this DVD for her, it's disappointed about music which is very classic music, it is too classic for a 16 month, ...boring."
3,What? I can't her you with all this eDead around!!!,"I am reasonably happy with it. The price is far more reasonable than others. The non adhesive side is nicely finished, easy to clean and does not stick to the underside of your carpet after install like most others. If money was no object, I would stay with Dynamat original in which I have lots of experience. I always use high heat with Dynamat original to install for the best bond. But this had to low of a melting point. As a conclusion, I didn't feel I got a good enough bond in the nooks and crannies. I also lined the inside of my computer case in an attempt to cut down fan noise- It was worth the time and about 5 square feet of eDead."
5,Proufound wisdom for all religions or no religion,"Although Joel Goldsmith has been dead many years, his writings live on & continue to help people understand their purpose here on earth. Truth is true yesterday,today & tomorrow...it will never change & once you understand what truth is, you will never go back to being the same person you once were. Joel Goldsmith will bring you to this point if you read this book or anyone of his other books. He does not teach any type of religion..he goes beyond specific teachings & into a world of KNOWING. Go there & peace will be with you forever."
2,Come on - you can do better than this,"Amazon.com - one of today's outstanding successes, a company that has gone from garage to myth in the shortest time, a company whose leader is legend. And yet Spector tries to offer a guide that supposedly explains Bezos' success without a single authorised interview. How can you even start to understand the business model when your sources are second hand clippings, public interviews or ex-employees?If you want to understand Amazon, just become a customer. If you want an easy read for a holiday, this is OK, just as long as you do not get irritated by the glib suggestions Spector puts at the end of each chapter to make you feel like you too can create the next Amazon.If you want a pot-noodle, this is for you. If you want a proper, well balanced business book, go elsewhere. By the way, I only gave it two stars because I now know how to pronoounce Bezos' name!"
2,a puff piece,"an ok read, pleasant enough, but it seemed more of an infomercial than a bit of critical reporting. theres hardly a negative comment in the book and little ""meat"", very little nitty-gritty. I had the impression it was commissioned by Amazon."
3,amazon.com: The Jeff Bezos story,"This book does a good, thorough job of recounting the history of amazon.com. However, Spector provides an overdose of information on the life and personality of amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. Also, there are other books which provide much better insights into e-business. One other word of caution--at the rate amazon.com is changing, this book, although published in 2000, will soon be seriously out of date."
3,A History of the Granddaddy of Internet Retailing,"An interesting and fairly well written account of Amazon.com, largely considered to be the granddaddy of internet retailing.The author provides a concise history of the company from its inception in the legendary Seattle garage, to the internet retailing behemoth it is now.One facet of the book I did find lacking was the author’s opinion of the prognosis of the profitability of the company, a question in the mind of most investors. Why can’t a multi-million dollar company with a worldwide of following millions of loyal customers seem to make a profit. This is one question that is lacking in this otherwise good history of Amazon.com. Amazon.com is a remarkable company that provides a service only possible in the internet age. Whether it is financially viable, and able to continue to provide this service remains a question inadequately answered by the author"
3,"Nice, but not more","The book is interesting if you read about Amazon.com and J.Bezos more throuroughly for the first time. It provides a number of interesting anecdotes, which I found inspiring. And it does a fairly good job with the dificult task of telling a story in the making. It is inevitable, that in such a fast-paced business, the book is already out of date. However, my main criticism goes to the author's apparent acceptance of all things amazon.com and JBezos. There is too little questionning, too few opinions from ""the other side"". I would have wished for a more balanced view of the story, deeper analysis into the business model, etc... Nevertheless, a worthwhile read whenever there's a spare minute..."
4,Great Book - Very Interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fast read for me. I was interested in the history of Amazon.com and I was not let down. I know some people have said the author does not give his opinion, and that it did not go into enough detail, but I think too much detail would have been boring. I give it a 4, and reccomend it to everyone who wants to know th ehistory of amazon.com."
1,Not great.,"I guess if I'd read this ten years ago I may have found it interesting. However, in this day and age with the Internet boom, it really is totally out of date and most of the info is irrelevant. I don't recommend you read it, there are far more fascinating and modern books about Amazon's rise as an internet giant available.""Get big fast"" made me think it would be a fast paced and exhilarating read, but I found the author's tone pretty boring."
3,"Enjoyable, energetic but without much substance","If you're a fan of Amazon I think this book is a great read but otherwise I'm not sure how much more this is worth. The author tries to summarize key points at the end of each chapter, in order to support its positioning as a business book. I can't say that the book is useful in any tactical sense, but I will say that after finishing it I was inspired by the entrepreneurial energy that comes from the overall narative. Good to get you charged up to start a company, but not enough detail to run it."
1,BEWARE,"BUYERS BEWARE! This product is NOT as is stated! I thought I was purchasing GRAPE airheads and received ORANGE airheads instead! To top that off, I got charged shipping to return the item when it wasn't even my fault."
4,Classic Music,Jr.Walker&The All Stars really Groove on this Disc.Shotgun is the jam it still Bangs.Jr.Walker is Rocking on Sax.The Up-Tempo Jams are The Juice.THe Ultimate Collection is Better overall but you can't go wrong here.
3,Not my favorite,"I bought this because I love M.C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth and Agatha Raisin series but this was a romance novel and that's not my thing. You can tell its Marion's writing, her wonderful talent shines through and the characters were really well developed. Unfortunately I couldn't finish this but if you love romance novels then this will be a great book for you. If you're a die hard cozy mystery lover (like myself), don't buy this because of the author."
3,"It was good, but the heroine was too much like her others.","I liked these books. The only problem I have with them, is that the heroines are always absolutely gorgeous, with a rich Lord hanging around in the background who just can't seem to get her out of his mind. She gets into trouble, he rescues her, she turns him down because she doesn't think she's good enough for him, or he's good enough for her. Very good light reading, and a pleasure, but not up to the Gone with The Wind class by a lot."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"Manny is an excellent instructor. I've been tinkering with photography since high school. Now, 50 years later, it's time to put down my typewriter and pick up my camera. Thank you Manny for the informative tips and excellent instruction. Now I can go from taking snapshots to creating photographs."
2,Wrong answer on second card,The cards are a bit thinner than I would like but they will do. What I don't like are wrong answers on them. Card A2 is not correct as written: H2CH3C-BR is wrong. The answer should be CH3CH2-BR. I have not looked through the rest of the cards only the three cards in the 'A' section. What ever happened to proof readers?
3,orgo flash cards,The box was opened with some cards here and there. Hard to tell if any of them were missing. But none of them were ripped at all.
5,Making the most of alternatives,Changing to a gluten free lifestyle has been fairly easy with the help of products such as this. I make it in a bread machine and add honey or other ingredients depending on what I want to do. I slice the bread and keep it in the refrigerator. This helps keep it from crumbling as much. It also seems to be best when toasted.
1,Yuk!,"This bread is the worst I've had. My husband is diabetic and will eat anything that is ""legal"" for him....and he even threw it away. The bread tastes like a dry sponge. Very disappointed."
2,Perfect except for the taste,"This bread bakes nicely. It toasts like wheat bread. It holds up when spreading peanut butter on it. It even goes stale like normal bread, which is great for some recipes. The only thing I can't get by is the taste. It just doesn't taste right. If you are going to use it for french toast, in a recipe or smear it with jelly to hide the taste, it is great. If you want some bread to eat with a little butter, you'll notice the odd taste."
5,Baked to perfection in my bread machine!,"I am not one to write reviews, but this bread is worth it. I have really been missing bread since I had to go gluten free and was skeptical about this product at first. I also have not had good luck with baking bread since I moved to Florida; I think the humidity affects the dough. I followed the directions on the bag exactly. I used one whole egg in a measuring cup and topped it up to 3/4 cup with egg whites from a carton. I put it all into my bread machine and set it for 1.5 lb loaf and medium crust. It smelled wonderful while baking and came out great. The bread slices well and tastes great. Maybe I can survive with a gluten-free diet!!"
3,OK,I don't mind the taste of this bread - but it's cakey not fluffy like wheat bread. My kids will eat it - but only toasted and warm - it crumbles very easy. I haven't found a GF bread that isn't crumbly - but out of the GF bread mixes I have tried - this is the most tasty.
2,tastes and smells like beans...,"I was recently diagnosed with celiac and our co-op had many Bob's Red Mill products, so I thought I'd try the bread mix. Used it in the bread machine and came home to a house that smelled terrible! Tasted the bread and it had a strange and unpleasant bean flavor and mushy consistency. I have talked to people who like the bean flavors in GF products, but its not my thing. Yesterday I made bread with Pamela's Bread mix and it was WONDERFUL! Tasted like the bread I made pre-GF days. Will be ordering bulk Pamela's baking mix (AWESOME--made muffins and they were great!) and bread mix on Amazon from now on."
3,Wonderful wonderful bread !,"THIS BREAD IS AWFUL(WELL I don't want the price to go UP )so I'll say its awful ,but in reality its better than any store bought white bread !,when you have the right crock to bake it in the bread turns out WONDERFUL and add a little yeast to give more rise !P.S. I didn't select 3 stars it just came up there,I wanted 5 stars !!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, but...","While, I do think this bread is good, I honestly think the Pamela's Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix is better. I made both in my bread machine and Pamela's was easier to make and tastier."
2,Not great,"I've made several loaves of this bread. It definitely has that ""gluten-free"" taste and texture - not comparable to wheat bread at all. It also tends to rise too much during baking and then collapses somewhat during cooling. This creates an odd shaped slice of bread. I recently tried Pamela's bread and it is great. I'm waiting until I've baked a few more loaves of it to give a final verdict, though..."
1,yucky bean flavor,"I love most Bob's Red Mill products, but not this one. The pie crust tasted like beans.... yuck! I would search rice flour with potato starch & tapioca starch as a better alternative."
2,yuck,"I wrote this review because of all of the wonderful reviews about this bread. It cooks and rises fine, looks good feels good but, it taste terrible! People keep saying beany taste I disagree, it tastes like soap to me. Once I am done eating it I can't get that soapy after taste out of my mouth. It over powers anything you try to eat with it. By far the worst bread I have tried so far. What is wrong with all these peoples taste buds that they don't notice I don't know but you have been warned."
5,I love this bread!,Great tasting Bread!! It is easy to make in my bread machine and is a dense bread that makes great toast.
2,brm vs pamelas,I feel bad for alot of other gf bread/baking flour makers because if more people discover the goodness of pamela bread mix they would go out of business. My sister and I are celiac and believe me we tried it all. We tried baking our own to purchasing about every different mix we could find and It came down to pamelas or BRM because they are more readily available at local grocery stores. Let me tell you Pamela blows them all away. I've had family member and co-workers (who by this time were pretty scared of taste testing my gf baked goods) completly surprised some even said they preferred over wheat varieties. The Sweet bread recipe taste almost like a moist potato bread. Sorry BRM
4,Nice Large Hearty Loaf,"This makes a nice, heavy loaf. If you are gluten free and desire a bread that is close to homemade white bread, then this is the one."
3,Not much luck.,"I've made it numerous times without much luck with either a bread machine or making it from scratch and baking in the oven. It browns nicely, but I always seem to wind up with a gummy center. I've made wheat based breads for years before my Celiac dignoses, without problems, so it's not like I'm new to bread baking. So I adapt, and cut out the gummy parts and make those slice into bread crumbs, and slice up the rest for sandwiches. Like most GF breads, this has to microwaved a few seconds before eating, or toasted. Not much flavor, so I try and jazz it up a bit with caraway seeds, sesame seeds or other seasonings."
4,Very good!,"My husband decided that he wanted to make me a loaf of ""freshly baked"" bread. But, neither my daughter or I can have gluten. So, he found this mix and made it. It worked extremely well in our bread machine. It rose nicely. And, baked up perfectly.It had a very nice spongy texture. And, it made great sandwiches. For the person on a gluten free diet who wants homemade bread, you can't beat this mix!"
3,was for my mother,i bought this for my ill mother i dont know if i used it wrong or it didnt work but i didnt care for it.
4,Good but pricey,I found the product to be easy and effective. The down side is the cost--more than $6.00 for one use. That is a very expensive hair washing session.
2,Not the Jari Love that I know,I was very dissappointed in this workout. I have almost all of the Jari Love workouts. I do one or more of the Extremely Ripped series every week. I was excited because this did sound like a different type of workout for her but it was just too different for me.I started the workout on the entire workout but after 2 dance combo's I had to stop and go straight to the Jari cardio only. The dance parts just could not get my heart rate up to a workout level. Plus I was bored. The Jari Love cardio sections also were not great. I usually feel her workouts are intense but these cardio segments were just ok and the transitions were horrible.The weight section was better but it still did not keep my heart rate elevated like her more recent extreme circuits have been doing. I was very dissappointed in my workout after this tape. I don't expect to ever use it again. I still love Jari Love but this was just not her usual high intense workout.
3,Good but not my favorite,"I love Jari, she is really one of my favorites, but this video really didn't do it for me. The weight portion is the best. That is Jari's strengths. The dance part was just flat out boring. She has someone else do it, and she is a good instructor, but I couldn't handle how boring it was. However, the weight portion was really great, and if you have a short time to workout and just do the weight portion then this would be worth it. Jari has much better ones. My favorites are get ripped 1000, get slim and lean and get ripped to the core. The get ripped series by far is her best."
4,Still making good ones,"Jari is the instructor that I LOVE to hate. I may have written that somewhere, before, excuse me if I am repeating myself. this workout is a different one for Jari and I like the change. I don't have a ""hate"" for Jari during this workout and that is a nice change for Jari."
3,Left me a bit disappointed,"I love Jari and her previous videos. I was so excited to get this newest video. I must agree with some of the other reviewers. The first time I did the video I thought I must have selected an ""off"" option because the cardio sections started in mid=stream. I have since done the workout again and found that is just how the seques (lack thereof?) are. I will add that the 2nd time I did the workout, the dancing felt more natural and I felt my muscles well into the evening, so it may be more of a workout than I had originally given it credit for. I would recommend any of the previous videos of Jari's over this one, but will keep this around for those days where I'm looking for a more ""jazzy"" dance workout."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a huge Jari Love fan -- I have most of her videos. But this one just really missed the mark for me. The dance/cardio was out of sync and just did not work for me. The 30 minute weights and ab routine is what saves this video. The overall quality of the video was not up to standards, either. The editing and choreography was very sloppy. It's like they put this video together in a day. It will be hard to top the Get Extremely Ripped 1000 DVD, by far her best."
2,Too Dancy,"I have bought every single Jari Love DVD. Maybe I was thinking that the workout would be challenging, like the others. But this was too dancy, and she was not even the instructor for those dance segments. In the future, I would suggest Jari stays with more conventional cardio workouts, like the segments SHE led in this video. I wish she had done the whole video with those types of segments. Oh well, I still love Jari, just not this DVD."
4,Nice change of pace...,I have all of Jari's DVD's and was happy to see something different come along. I felt like I had 2 left feet when it came to the dance portions but think after a few more times I will do better. I kind of missed using the step but can see why she left it out. I didn't find any of it too difficult and I wasn't sore at all the next day. I did feel like I got a good workout though. I am not bothered by the outfits or background. I'm too busy concentrating on good form to worry about their outfits.Bottom line if you are as motivated by Jari and the results you've seen by doing Ripped as I am then you will love Body Rock too...
2,What happened?,"This is the first Jari video that I can truely say was bad. Really bad. Can't think of anything good to say about it. That's a first for me. I love her videos, even the last one that got some bad reviews."
3,Disappointed,"I own all of Jari Love's Ripped DVDs, so I was sure that I would love her newest addition. I was wrong. This workout is different than the others in a few ways. The cardio portion is not only ridiculously fast, but there are no introductions or transitions. They begin abruptly at full speed. The dance portions look fun, but I find them somewhat confusing, fast, and brief. Maybe I'll catch on after a while, but they are not as easy to do as Jari claims. The weight section of the workout is good, but too short. The included exercises really worked my muscles, but because I am used to her other workouts, I felt that there was not enough work on the lower body. Overall, I found this to be much less motivating than her other workouts. I will attempt it a few more times to see if I can learn (and then keep up with) the dance moves, but it will not be one of my preferred DVDs. I would instead recommend Jari's previous DVDJari Love: Get Extremely Ripped! 1000. This workout is intense and fun."
2,More Material Is Needed!,"This is a travesty to name this recording ""at his best"" The Material of the Late, Great, David Ruffin is much, much more diverse than this. I personally own every album he did with the Temptations as well as his solo albums, and this collection is vasty impovershed. Like one of the previous posters stated Mr.Ruffin deserves a box set...and soon!"
1,Poor Quality,"Rubber Maid fell short on this item. 1st day of usage the folders inner plastic that holds the folders to the outer plastic cover ripped. Product overview shows folder can be expanded with multiple items,hard to believe since I placed minimal amounts of papers in 3 out of the six folders.The idea is great, but the quality is poor."
4,pool time,it is a great product and the only that would go all the way across our 30 ft above ground round pool
1,A PIECE OF GARBAGE,"THIS PRODUCT IS COMPLETE GARBAGE. MY HUSBAND AND I TRIED TO PUT IT UP FOROVER AN HOUR AND THE POLES KEPT COMING DOWN, THE NET CONTINUALLY SAGS (NO MATTER HOWMUCH YOU TIGHTEN IT) AND THE NET DIDN'T GO COMPLETELY ACROSS OUR 26 FT. ABOVE GROUND ROUND POOL. NOT ONLY DID I WASTE MY TIME AND MONEY, BUT NOW I HAVE DRILL HOLES AROUND THE EDGE OF MY POOL (WHICH ARE A BIT SHARP) WHERE MY HUSBAND DRILLED TO HOLD UP THE POLES! WE NOW HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING TO FILL IN THE HOLES SO MY CHILDREN DON'T CUT THEMSELVES. I AM DISGUSTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE I HAD TO RATE IT SOMEHOW OR I COULDN'T WRITE THIS REVIEW."
1,disappointing,This net is only about 10 feet wide and definitely not big enough for a 30 foot pool. The quality is poor and the net breaks away at the slightest touch. Very disappointing!
4,"Goodbye Rico, we're gonna miss you.","Michael Nava may not be a great mystery writer, so what. What is more important is that he is, simply, a great writer. The truth is that I knew ""who done it"" about a third of the way through, but that didn't matter. What mattered was that I got to spend time with Henry again. I love this character. From ""The Little Death"" through ""The Death of Friends,"" we've seen Henry weather it all. Indeed, we've weathered it with him. I love that the author has brought John into Henry's life. Their love affair was much more compelling than the mystery surrounding it. Michael Nava is a very emotional writer. His novels touch on all sorts of issues confronting gay people. I hope that straight people are reading his books, there is so much to be learned from them. I understand that this is the last Henry Rios mystery, I only hope that this is not the last Michael Nava novel, that would be a crime."
4,A nice ending for the series,"Having read the entire series of Henry Rios novels over the years I found this to be a moving ending to the series. This may not be the best in the series as far as the ""mystery"", but I feel strongly empathetic with Henry. The beautifully drawn character has been through so many milestones that parallel many gay men's lives that you can't help but be drawn in. I found myself deeply saddened that this will be the last of Michael Nava's Rios series. I only hope that in the future he comes out with something as good"
3,this game is ok but buy a newer version,this game has good game play but a newer version of it can be bought for a cheap price as well. The graphics look really bad if you have played anything above PS1 this was the only college football game we had in my dorm room and we always complained about the graphics but the Gamecocks always win baby
4,Great book,"These sorts of personal memoirs are not common in Morocco, and as a result they are vitally important. This one is not only useful, but an interesting read as well."
3,"Design, Capability Excellent, Workmanship Poor","I think I got one of the first of these from Amazon. The door was not hung correctly, so it does not open or close easily, and the base of the unit is uneven, so it wobbles. Looks good, but disappointing workmanship and QA."
