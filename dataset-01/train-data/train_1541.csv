2,Scratchy material,"I purchased this for my 2 bunnies but both of them had no interest in it, they walked around it once and never came close to it again. The material is less than what I expected, its too scratchy for rabbit's delicate skin, I also think the coloring of the product is unnecessary, it would have been a more natural & safe product for animals to chew on."
5,Great for guinea pigs!,"We recently adopted our first guinea pigs. We asked the rescue organization for recommendations on what toys to buy since there are so many out there. This was one on the short list of recommended items. Our guineas absolutely love it!It is currently rolled up in a semicircle and they love to run through it, hide under it, and even climb up on top of it and look around. It is great for them to chew on, also. And, like another reviewer said, you can just change the shape or the positioning of this and it is like a brand new toy to them.I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,My Bunnies Love It,"My two Dutch bunnies just love their Fiddle Sticks hideout. What a great concept to use wire so that the hideout can be re-shaped as often as you want! I've had it for over four months now and it's still in great shape. We usually make an arch and the bunnies nap under it or practice hopping over it. They also like to climb on top, sit back on their hind legs, and look all around! My only complaint is that the dye runs when you wash it."
3,to big :(,There is nothing wrong with the item it came quickly and with no troubles! its to large for my cage tho :(
5,Great product,"I love this, its hudge and colorful, to holds up great and i love changing the shape to give the chins ""something new"" without shelling out tons of money"
5,"Cool product, my chinchilla loves it!",This is an awesome toy for any bigger rodent! My chinchilla loves playing in it. It's flexible and easy to bend into any shape you want. I have mine shaped into a hideaway. My chinchilla also loves gnawing on it!
5,ITS JUST WHAT I NEEDED!,I bought this product and got it very fast. And my two bunnies love it! If they did'nt have it...I am pretty sure they would not live! (hahahahah)...Well if u have rabbits you should get this product!!! it is the best thing I have in my bunnies hutch!!! BUY IT!
4,Excellent for toy or utility,"My rabbits love this! Originally I would make different shapes out of it each day and they would get curious to try and figure it out. Eventually I settled on making it a ramp to get into their cage (they are free-roam) because they have a 3-4"" jump to get into it. They run up and down on it, chew on it, run under it to hide, etc.The 4 stars is because you have to be careful with this on carpet. A little water and the dye will cause a stain that is pretty hard to remove."
5,enjoyable,"these guys sound like the pixies. to me, thats a good thing. this album has some good songwriting and interesting bass/guitar interplay. i thought the lyrics were too basic at first (seems like they wrote em in 5 minutes) but i got over it and you will too. the last song is a nice change of pace and a good song too. i like the change of singers every other track or so, helps keep things from getting stale.if you like this you might like mclusky, pixies, raveonettes, jesus lizard, nirvana, and death from above 1979 just to name a few."
1,"Music for hipsters to overhype, then forget about.","Let's face it; if you're a New York band that's got a woman bassist with a husky voice, singing over deafening guitars, you're going to sound like Sonic Youth, and be compared to them. It's unavoidable. Sadly, what Skeet Ulrich is to Johnny Depp, Blood On The Wall are to Sonic Youth.Too bad. They get off to a good start with ""Stoner Jam,"" which has a ""grey fall day in the East Village"" vibe. The problem is, nothing else really distinguishes itself.The majority of songs are just short, fast and loud. You can get away with that if you're The Ramones, and pack loads of hooks and melodies on top of all the #$@$-kicking guitars and drums. But there's nothing here to pull you in. It's just ""hi, bye"" and that's it.""Awesomer"" is around the same length as a bad TV sitcom. And about as much fun."
2,sweet but boring and predictable,cute and sweet but boring and predictable. I never really got to know the characters. The anger and sadness from a divorce was not felt by the reader. The love between the two main characters was shallow and developed too quickly. Not interested in book 2.
5,"wonderful book, wonderful writing...","when I picked up this book from the library of the recommendation of a friend, I had no idea I would like it so much. The witing is wonderful...it seems to give a very realistic picture of the turmoil that is caused among children of divorced families, and the adjustments they need to make. Most of all,the book didnt try to play nice...it potrays very clearly the insensitivity of the spouses who cause the divorce, in terms of expectations regarding the children ..and how they are expected to behave towards their n ew loves. The best part comes initially in the book when Maddie wants to ""curse Dr. Phil"" and all those therapists who dole out inane advise about the ""best interests of the child"". The writing is very fluid and humorous as well. I cant wait to read her other books."
4,Great Author,Have read several of her other books and was once again happy with her. Would love to know what happens next.
5,Stealing Home by Sherryl Woods,This was a fabulouse read. A great beach or by the pool book. It keeps you engaged till the end. I can't wait to read the other two in the series! I found another new writer to add to my favorite's list!
4,A cozy read....,"I did like this book - but it would have felt much fresher if I hadn't read it right after reading Jennifer Crusie's TELL ME LIES, which tells a similar story of a cheating husband and a wife who finds a new flame. The Crusie book has more levels, plus a convoluted mystery, although it does not get into the head of the cheating husband as Woods does. I really liked the dialogue, especially for the teen-age and younger kids; it rang true. The small town atmosphere was also well-rendered, with just enough love of gossip and willingness to believe the worst to make it a less than idyllic place to live. The overall tone and the ending were cozy, even if several elements were rather sad. But, then again, divorce is sad no matter how happily some people end up."
4,Stealing Home (Sweet Magnolias_,"It was very interesting, holding ones interest is very important to me and a happy ending is alwaysa good thing"
4,Loved it,Wish Upon a Cowboy is everything a romance should be. Laughter and tears and lots of warm touches. Ms. Kane really touched my heart with this one.
3,A fairly good read,"I had very high hopes for this book, and it did deliver for about 3/4 way through.The concept of having witches and warlocks in the wild west and their abilities were portrayed quite believably and there was definate chemistry between the 2 main characters.What disappoinated me was the ending. It seemed almost too rushed. The entire book led its way to the final confrontation between Jonas and the evil warlock which was settled in just a few pages. Having Jonas defeat the evil warlock simply by opening his heart to love and accepting his destiny was just ... a HUGE disappointment.An even bigger disappointment was Hannah. She was portrayed as spunky and stubborn, yet likeable and funny. But towards the end and especially during the confrontation, she suddenly became a simpering helpless female. At the very least she should have displayed some backbone and have faith in her aunt and her beloved.Still it was a very entertaining read up till the end."
3,Love is Magic.,"Hannah Lowell needed help, both with her witchcraft and in defeating evil warlock Blake Wolcott's takeover of her New England hometown. Her aunt Eudora sends her west to find the missing Guild head, the MacKenzie. Jonas MacKenzie had been raised without knowledge of his magical background, working his ranch and mourning the loss of his wife and newborn child years earlier. The last thing Jonas wants is a crazy woman spouting nonsense about marrying him and witchcraft.The actual showdown with Blake was anticlimatic. The setup stated that people who tried to leave town were horribly killed. Yet Hannah leaves town with no problem and Eudora soon follows. I think I would've liked this tale more if the setting had stayed in New England or the West, but not both. Still not a bad story, but not up to speed."
2,"Extremely accurate, for a toy","I'll give this 4 stars as far as durability goesm seeing as the blade, when removed from the packaging, does bend a bit easily, and might be prone to breaking. I don't think this was intended to be edcational in any way, so that explains the low rating there. And as for fun, it looks nice, but isn't the sort of thing you want to play around with. Like the other figures in the Unleashed line, it works better as a mini-statuette."
2,"Cheap, scratched glass","I purchased this tumbler set for my sister-in-law's birthday. She was very appreciative because she loved the logo & the look of the glasses. On closer inspection, the glass is very cheap & flimsy. The frosted exterior was chipped & scratched on each cup in several places. Not sure if I'd buy from this company again because the product I received was not representative of the product shown on Amazon."
2,The Mysterious Valley,"I have not finished reading this book, however, I find that it rambles and is poorly written. Having lived in this valley back in the 1950's I am also confused about where he is taking us with all this rambling and location information. Why is there no map included. It would be very orientating. Where is a photo of the cattle mutilation.? Why is the print so small? I am trying to get through it, but it is difficult."
1,Hate this answering machine.,"Normally I try not to write anything bad about a product but this answering machine I really do not like. Even though it records the messages alright, the time and date is always wrong. So far I have put in the correct dates and times I do not know how many times, but when I get a message the date and time is never right. If the message came in on Monday it will say Tuesday. Also it is suppose to have the ability that when you are not at home you can call your number, hit the number sign and put in your code. Most of the time that does not work. I have to keep trying over and over again. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Pyle PLD70BT-7 Inch tft touch Screen,"Work great..Had it for a While Some kinks. Runs every cd,dvd ect...It's great when out camping or driving with the bluetooth.."
4,Nice!!!!,I got this stereo and installed it in my 1990 Dadge Ram W150. With a few adjusments it fits in there comfortably. The sound quality is perfect and everything works just had a problem conected with bluetooth. Trying to get it resolved so that i can connect with it.I looked closer at my owners manual and the code for the bluetooth is under the BT information.
2,Badly in need of editorial assistance.,"This book is well plotted, but is so much in need of a competent editorial hand that it is difficult to read. I understand that this is a self published book, but nonethless the author should have had it edited beforehand, since the publisher doesn't seem to do any editing."
2,"Wow, this game sucks","If I hadn't found this for next to nothing I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. That said, this game is a pathetic attempt to take a terrible bmx game and try to salvage it and cash in on the pubescent crowd by putting stripper videos as prizes. The ""prizes"" are fully censored advertisments for strip clubs. There is no skin shown in this game that you haven't seen at the mall.The game itself isn't worth the cd it's printed on."
2,Fun?,I rented this game for my PS2 becuase I was interested to try it. It uses the same formula as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 where you go up to people and they then give you a goal. That is a good feature but you also have a health meter which stinks becuase you could be doing really good but then you fall and lose your health and then your done. The goals are really boring to becuase most of them are find 5 of these or go get 5 or those. Which is really boring. So I say you avoid this game at all costs.
2,"Terrible, Spoilers","This is a mixture of Tony hawk and Grand theft auto. Both of those being excellent game, while this one terrible.The graphics and controls are great, but the game play is not too good. Sometimes th grpahics make you dizzy.It just seemed that the devleopers were just trying to follow GTA to create a controversy so that it sells. Directions are hard, you can expect to spend a considerable amount of time since a map is not available. And as a reward for finishing an entire level, and winning all the matches and jumping over various obstables (called gaps which are very hard to find)....It is better to get GTA or Tony hawk than this one."
2,Didn't fit,The adapter was purchased to enable me to use a solar phone charger which did not include a compatable USB connector for my phone. This article was located and I thought it would fit but it didn't. S/H charges made it more expensive to return so I ate the original cost and still can't use the solar charger.
2,"THIS GAME is not good, I THINK U NEED A GRAPHICS ACCELERATOR to work",Don't buy this game. For some reason it goes back 2 my desktop sometimes when i click on a game!! Buy half-life or Unreal Tourament if u dont have a 3d accelerator. Those will work fine and r awesome games!! The reason i gave it 2 stars instead of none is becuz THIS GAME ROCKS!! if u can get it working correctly! Its completely amazing! U'll never wanna get off. ITs so good u might get kicked off it by ur mom!! IF U CAN GET IT 2 WORK THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!
1,Reading this book more difficult than Cook's voyages,"If you can speed read Shakespeare (DeVere) or king's english then you may consider submitting yourself to the tedious, convoluted and tortuous language that was a torture to me.Had Samuel Clemmens authored the accumulated details or the products of the author's research the comprehension would have been easier, yet still wanting the omission of trivial and boring details."
4,"A good read, strange word choice at times.","The history, anthropology and sociology presented are well written at least 90% of the time. At other times the writer seems to get bogged down in making hindsighted judgments about certain situations and injects quite a bit of his personal thoughts... but hey it's his book and it's not sold as being a dry history book. It is all about Cook and the impact his expeditions had on the local islanders.I would have rated the book higher had it not been for some very poor word choices that caught me off guard (read ""profanity""). Including the fairly random use of the ""F"" word at one point in the book, which really seemed out of place and truly bizarre."
2,Captain Cook Oppresses The Noble Savage,"I was hoping for a detailed description of the voyages, such as life aboard ship, weather conditions, British maritime customs, etc. Instead, you get a shallow analysis of the sociological implications of culture clash between the brutal British and the angelic natives, with much political correctness and rank speculation thrown in.Howard Zinn's style of revisionist history is alive and well."
1,"Danger plot give-away: Cook bad, natives good","Perhaps the title should have been a hint - Simply ""Cook"", no Captain. Within pages this guy had me bored by his unimaginative noble savage approach. He does not appear to really know very deeply the social, political and intellectual world in which Cook lived, either. This is the first book about the great Captain Cook, an unassuming hero and superachiever, that I have ever found just too boring to finish. The axe grinding is just too much. For heaven's sake, if you've never read anything about Captain Cook, don't make this the first. Probably just stay away from anything written by this author, who in my opinion is a good example of ""a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest""."
4,It's good,"Excellent- There's a short scene where a naked woman uses a ""Slip and Slide""; An exellent segment where two woman wash a car in various stages of undress; Another scene has half-naked women pretending to be pirates.Good- Most of this video is full of beautiful naked women frolicking in the surf and under streams of water.Bad- The photographers and editors were two artsy. The camera dosen't stand still much and most scenes are too quick. The camera also tends to focus in on half of the model and after a second move up or down to view the other half, so we don't view her full body very often. Dissapearing women and ""dream-like"" segments are weird and bothersome; The music and narrator are odd too; A couple of women do not remove their clothes, leaving them simply ""wet""; A few of the segments are photos that are strung together, which is really anoying because they would have been the best segments if they were in live action."
5,good skull for the price,"At under $20.00, this is a good buy. THe lower jaw is attached securely with 2 wire springs that allow for jaw movement. You can manipulate the jaw so that it does not match up as easily as you can place the jaw correctly. I mention this only because I don't know that the springs would hold up being passed around a classroom time and again. The material is a plastic compound that feels durable and light weight but not overly thin. This skull is for my daughter to use as a model for art so perfection is not an issue. Consider this evaluation in that light."
3,Good value at the expense of quality...,"My wife was looking for a prop skull to use while acting out Shakespeare with her high-schoolers. She also didn't want to shell out a ton of cash. This skull was within her price range and will serve its purpose, but as outlined in other reviews it is poorly constructed. The jaw seems to be deformed, so it doesn't fit in the niche where it is supposed to. In two or three places, the exterior paint has cracked, exposing the dense styrofoam base beneath. For a cheap-o value prop skull, it will serve its purpose. Those looking for something that is high-quality and anatomically correct, look elsewhere."
3,Not impressed,The screws holding the springs for the jaw were pulling out of the skulls temples and caused an ugly hole. The jaws and teeth didn't line up at all. There was an obvious attachment line across the top of the skull that had been poorly sanded. This skull is smaller than an adult skull would be.
1,Jaw doesn't fit right,"Lower jaw is deformed and doesn't fit right, causing the bottom teeth to hideously not align with the top teeth. It looks so bad that it looks like the jaw came off a cro-magnon man and bolted on with a horrible and VERY visible spring. In other words, the picture of this product is NOT what you receive...buyers beware.This would be an acceptable prop or toy (i'm going to be zombifying it) if the price was brought down to around $15. If the manufacturer doesn't want to drop the price that low, then they need to make a corrected jaw with a discrete sprung hinge....like their picture advertises."
4,But Why Not One Piece?,"From the same company that brings you the 5 lb fat replica, it's the 2 piece life size human skull!Obviously, this is pretty good if you want to put on some sort of medical seminar. It's great for that. But it's even better if you have some sort of secret club or fraternity that calls for a skull in your initiation rituals. And don't get me started on Halloween parties. This thing is LIFE SIZE, so it will make your friends or new initiates think they are looking at the real thing when they first encounter it. And realism is important. Nobody wants some cheap plastic human skull or a skull that is too small to be believable. So this one is a great choice. Did I mention it's Life Size?My only complaint is that they made this two pieces. Why not a one piece skull that would look even more realistic?"
1,.........but they fixed the problem,"They sent a defective one and said they would replace at no charge. Thouch skeptical, it arrived a few days latter, as promised, at no extra charge, plus I got to keep the defective one too. All good, almost. That all being said, it wasnt exactly like the one in the photo, as the definition of teeth was not the same. I guess you get what you pay for. Next time will will spend the extra money to get a better quality skull. They were only third person handlers and would have preferred to go directly to the original company from the get=go."
2,Book needs to be updated,"I reviewed this book recently, and found two things bothersome. First of all, the drawings are of structures with outdated decor and ""gingerbread"" design. Second and possibly related, this book has not been updated since 1983. If it is also true that the publishing company or author is not responding to ""plan requests"" as stated by the last poster, it would seem best to move on to a current publication."
3,OMG this shirt is soooo tiny!!!,great quality shirt but it's SO frickin small!!! I got an x-large and it's still really tight!
5,I love this shirt!,"This is a very nice shirt.. nice quality comfortable.. I normally wear a medium, but after reviewing the size chart, I got an extra large and it fits perfectly.. check the customer images to see how the extra large fits someone who's normally a medium. :) Don't get it if you normally wear a large or extra large. Be sure to check the sizing chart. :)"
5,Very fast,I received the package ahead of what I was expecting. It arrived sealed and ready to be gifted. Thank you!
3,Inappropriate but fun,"I wouldn't call this a bad game, it's just not an exceptional one. It plays like your average extreme sports title where you ride around, rack up points, and complete goals. Only this time the goals can get wildly inappropriate and your end reward is video clips of strippers doing their thing. The bmx engine and physics aren't the best, but they get the job done.I've read reviews that completely trash this game because it panders to the lowest common denominator, and I think that's unfair. Yeah girls and potty humour don't elevate average gameplay, but they don't take away from it either. If you like extreme sports titles and are in the mood for dirty jokes and nudity, this is recommended. If not, just stay away. Simple as that."
5,Good game.,"Pretty good game for the original Xbox. A lot different than Dave Mirra's games, but it's still a lot of fun!"
2,"Its a stupid, humerous game.","This game really is dumb, it has funny moments, and you can't go wrong with strippers. But its a game more for voyerism than actual playability."
4,help,"this is the best games i have ever played on the xbox, well its the only game i have ever played on the xbox. but if theres any one out there that can tell me how to do the calanage where ya have to get 20000 points in the pit with the dougnut, and the one where ya have to do a nothing air over the alien, and finllay how to get the jetpack to go. someone help me, action_man_am@hotmail.com"
1,Raunchy,"Challenges including transporting prostitutes to an abusive pimp and knocking out cameras for a shoplifter. Profanity includes [words] expressed for solely shock value and some activities revolve around a fascination with defecation. Further strong sexual language is used when the rider falls off the bicycle. Actual footage of topless women appear on later levels, and one can edit the rider down to near nudity. Built on the Dave Mirra engine, this game has great graphics and additional BMX freestyle tricks (although I don't like the inability to configure one's controller), but the constant profanity and ridiculous challenges make this game repulsive.This game will be a heads up for parents who don't pay attention to the game ratings, pushing the M for mature to the extreme (even surpassing the content of GTA3:Vice City). This game is neither for children nor for adults."
3,poorly shaped,i don't know why someone would make a hat that is not shaped at all like a head. this hat is very oddly shaped. looks terrible when i put it on.
1,Not good...,"This product should be labeled naturally sweetened instead of unsweetened. They are sweetened with cane juice. They do not have sulphured preservative.Since Mangos are sweet already, why do they even bother. The following is my theory. I think this importer gets the mangos un-ripened since they are shipped so far. They then load them up with sugar to disguise this. The result is dried mango which is nearly white in color and has very little mango taste to it. It basically tastes like you're eating a chewy piece of crystalized sugar.Not what I was looking for. Oh, and Amazon does not allow returns on this product. Another let down.Country of origin for the mangos was Thailand if anyone cares."
2,What?!?!,"I order two of these for my girlfreind's 20'th, and 1 day prior am notified that i will only receive one. Words cannot describe how dissapointed i am with this service."
5,Clear hip bag,Once again I love the fact that these bags are clear. It makes finding things easy. They are well mad and very useful. I really recommend them.
3,Clear Tote,"This purse seems to be a bargain. However, I wish that the strap was longer to go across the chest and shoulder of an adult. So short, it fit my 9 yr old very well. Even though its adjustable, not so hippy afterall. Not practical as I thought. Will return or give it away since it was so cheap."
3,good for those looking for a work purse...ie..Casinos,this purse works great... it was shipped in a week. Its a little long for my taste but workable.The zipper feels a little fragile but hold up.. The strap is adjustable so it works for holding it or on the shoulder too. i would suggest this.update....maybe a month later my zipper broke...not sure how to fix that but id like one to last longer.......
2,Its not what i expected,"I ts too small,I guess I'm not good with measurement. I was going to use it for work. I thought when u adjust the strap it will be long enough so it can go across your body. I guess I can use it for lunch bag."
2,Clear Bag,My strap popped I put a water and small bottle of soda in it. I still use it but I put it inside another bag
5,works perfect for what it's needed for.,"I work in a high security building it's so easy, no more opening my purse to show then, just walk on by.. Love it!"
5,Even this non-fan of country music likes this album,"My husband, who loves fingerpicking guitar and country music, bought this after getting it as a recommendation from Amazon. Even I, who do not share his love of this kind of music, think it's terrific."
3,Like The Old Chet,I've got just about every CD that Chet ever produced and this is not one of his best. Guess I just like the old country songs and his CD of Beatles tunes better.
2,Avoids crucial issues,"I have used this commentary in my personal study of the book of Acts. Though Bruce is a good scholar, he does not do a good job here. He avoids the crucial issues that automatically sufaces when one reads the text. Often he just restates what the text has already said. I suppose this shows the difficulty of writing a commentary on a historical book, compared to a ""teaching"" book. Put your money on Marshalls Tyndale commentary instead. He has a remarkable ability to forecast which questions the reader will have."
3,Informative book,"It's okay, there were parts that I really liked and some parts that seemed a little bit too wordy and repetitive."
2,So-So,"The Styluses are ok...they fit in the Storage slot in the back of the DS but they arent made very well and they slip right out. The game cases are ok, but there is nowhere to store them. Same with the Styluses, I have lost all the replacement styluses (main reason i bought this) because 2 of them fell out of the back of the DS, and the other one got lost because there is no place to store it in the case.The screen protectors don't stay on the screen and they get wrinkled and slide around making gameplay difficult. The headphones are fine and so is the car adapter and the Screen wiper thing. The case is bulky and the play-thru holder for the DS doesnt fit it quite right making it difficult to push the buttons while the system is in the case.The only parts of the set that fully worked as advertised were the headphones, the car adapter, the screen cleaner (just a cloth attached to a bag), and (sort of) the case.If those are worth the price to you, then go for it."
4,looks ok i need to see other reviews of it though before buying,"hey people, i dont have this item but i want others to buy it so they can review it and i can see how it is! someone needs to put up a picture also . the description makes it sound good though. :]"
3,Which version is this?,"Is this the original 1984 version, or the one that was re-recorded in 1985 and became a big hit in 1986?"
4,"REAL life, REAL people, REAL photos!",I think my title said it all. Let's hear it for real! A little blip on many Moms from across the world and their precious ASD kiddos...can't wait for the Dad's book!!
2,Not what it purports to be,"First, the Mille Miglia is NOT Formula One, and second the historical flashbacks are stilted and inaccurate. Assassins in a car race harking back to WWII Nazis? Give me a break!If you want to read about the Mille Miglia, try J. Fontana's ""The 1000 Mile Dream"" or Al Karasa's ""Sherridan's Rain"" [...]. You'll do much better."
5,A Very Good Book!,"This is one of the best debuts novels I ever read. The author captures your attention and never lets go. The suspense never lets up. I think suspense readers will definitely love this book. The tragic incident was heart wrenching. And you couldn't help but find yourself getting behind Louis. He is a very likable character. I wish the book could have been longer. I will definitely add to my ""authors to look for list"". I can't wait to read the next Louis Kincaid novel."
4,"Intrigue indeed, but could use more twist and turns","Dark of the Moon was a quick read that really sets the reader through the eyes of Louis Kincaid. I wonder how many readers were not able to ""see"" the story for not being able to relate to the main character. It brings the ugly picture of race, racism, and ignorance forward, (from both sides, White and Black), yet allows for some resolution of the issues without painting a happy rosey ""all is resolved and good in this land"" ending. I do wish that more twist and turns would have lay in wait for me as the reader, (don't get me wrong there were curves and twists, but I wish there were more twists than curves). Overall it is a book that I wish more would take the chance to open and see the world of Black Pool through Louis Kincaid's eyes."
5,arrived ASAP & was in excellant condition (no longer in bookstores),DARK of the MOON by P.J Parrish / excellant service and I appreciate the expedited delivery.
3,Well written but violent,"The writing is good, and the character development is mostly good. But this is one of those mysteries with a lot of violence, so I'll be skipping this author in the future."
2,The South...Just Like Everyone Told Me,"This should have been a better book, but oh well. A bland sort of story with few surprises, but a whole lot of cliches.Because of course everyone KNOWS that every white person in the South is a heartbeat away from going to a lynching, and they hardly bother to conceal their white hoods. And when our handsome hero is, by the end of the novel, staggering down the RR tracks, running from the corrupt law enforcement mob, after barely escaping the noose himself, it's just kind of pathetic. You know from the start where this is going. The devils all had their horns out from the start.However, the fictional ugliness of Black Pool does remind me of the real ugliness in DC today, December 2009."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!,"I have read many wonderful mystery novels and I do not believe ""Dark of the Moon"" was very good. Louis Kincaid, a sherriff in this small town, who is the main character, is not a very likeable character at all. The mystery that the police in this little community in Mississippi have to solve, is the thirty year old murder of a young black man. His bones are discovered in the present with a noose next to the body, and Louis Kincaid feels a special bond between the boy and himself, since they are both black. Many years ago many blacks in Mississippi were treated as slaves and being hung. Louis really wants to discover who hung and killed this innocent young man. Unfortunately, everyone in the town doesn't want to talk to him. Secrets are everywhere around there. A few more people die along the way. The conclusion wasn't very good also. If you're looking for mystery novels to read, save your money for James Patterson."
1,"Great content, terrible delivery","I was thrilled to see this release. These were historic games (even if you're not a die hard Giants fan, as I am) and the ability to keep them forever was fantastic. However (and it is a HUGE ""however"") when they arrived and I played the first DVD I was surprised to see that the set I received was in old-style 4:3 video format (remember the square screen tv's of the 20th century?) So I contacted Amazon thinking I ordered the wrong format, yet was blown away to find out that this is the only was it was released!!! Come on now, you can't buy a 4:3 screen TV anymore, EVERYTHING is WIDESCREEN! WHY RELEASE THE MOST EPIC SERIES OF SPORTS EVENTS IN 4:3???? The games were even recorded in widescreen! They INTENTIONALLY crippled them.I returned the set. Disgusted."
5,Great Idea by the NFL,"This is a great idea for the NFL. Releasing full games, including the Super Bowl. I bought it for one of the greatest regular season finales ever, Favre's last game (I'm a Packers fan), and one of the greatest and most significant Super Bowls ever. The NFL should do this every season. I would also like to see other teams get DVD packs. Maybe release a Top 5 games for each team. I think it'd sell really well for the NFL although it might take away from all those NFL Replay games on NFL Network.Some things I didn't like was no widescreen and very little post or pre-game coverage. It's good though to get through all the hype and just see the game. I've already watched the Super Bowl twice since I bought it."
4,amazing!!,its was great any giants fan will love this only thing that upset me was they didnt show no superbowl celebration after wards but besides that i loved it and about the quality its absolutely fine so dont listen to the people bitching about it
4,"Great to re-live the memories, but...","...would've been nice to have the option to buy it in HD. NFL really dropped the ball on that one. Otherwise, great set and would make a great gift for any Giants fan."
4,The editing work is good,"The games were edited to remove the commercials, and any worthless time, which allows you to just focus on the actual plays.One thing, though, is that I was expecting backstage scenes from the game, sideline talks, players' interviews, etc.But still, it is a pretty good investment."
3,A Great Christmas gift for any NYG fan!!,"I recently just bought this gift for my older brother..and he says he loves it!! It has every game the Giants played in during the postseason last year even the game against Favre..I love seeing Brett fail, LOL..I am so mad he lost for the Patriots to go to the playoffs this year since I am a Pats fan..but whatever, It's a good DVD, you should buy it only if your a Giants fan or anyone who hates the Patriots, A good buy!"
4,"Great set, but it at least could have been widescreen!","Ok, so they did not make a high-def version, but they could have released this in widescreen at least!! Still, nice set and GO G-MEN!!!"
3,A Giant disappointment,"It was a thrill to be able to buy DVDs of one of the greatest postseason runs of all time, but the set was disappointing. The video transfer is poor in standard definition, and it looks absolutely awful on a large HD set. It's a shame this wasn't released in Blu-Ray (maybe Warner didn't expect a big demand?) and it was absolutely criminal to leave off the postgame celebration and Super Bowl trophy presentation. Certainly they could have cobbled something together out of the postgame plus the parade and subsequent rallies? I'll keep the set for posterity, but if I want to watch the famous 3rd-and-5, I'll have to stick with my lefover DVR recording."
2,Wouldnt recommend,"A NICE DVD FOR THE TRUE BLUE GIANT FAN, BUT I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS, PIC QUALITY SUX, AN HD VERSION MUST BE AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE."
1,Picture Quality Terrible-Amature Looking Will Not Watch!!!,"I am Very surprised that NFL and NFL Films has their names associated with this DVD. I have Sony 60"" HD LCD The video quality looks like it was copied over and over again like the old vcr tapes did. It is not clear, and when says"" made to fit screen"" it looks distorted. Tried it on 37"" HD TV same results. I was so anxious to see the game again and I Love the Giants and I will not watch this. I wish I Tivo'd this. I wish I could get my money back. I am terribly dissappoined with this. Concept was great having complete games, but not worth watching unless you have an ""old"" tv set!!!"
5,Giants - Road to the Superbowl,"This was a gift, so I didn't actually watch it. I am sure it was great. Too bad they aren't going back to the SB again this year."
4,Love It!!!!!,They cut all the commercials and nonsense.....that is a good thing. I just wish there was a way to cut out the Joe Buck play by play.....he needs to be beaten to a pulp!!!! He is so anti-New York.....whether it's football or baseball he is always rooting against us. I think he would actually wipe Farve's high-knee if he was allowed to.
3,Initially Excited But Ultimately Disappointed,"The release of a DVD with all 4 playoff games as well as the season finale was a terrific move by the NFL. However, I am very disappointed by two things. One is the picture quality, which is good enough but vastly inferior to the HD broadcast. Second is the elimination of all postgame and most pregame from each broadcast. For me, the real enjoyment of the Giants' remarkable run was watching the players reveling and the announcers eating crow. And how could you eliminate the team introductions and the trophy presentation from the Super Bowl? I certainly hope there are plans for a Blue-Ray version that will restore the pre & postgame festivities."
4,Looks like Ruben is correct...,"... in that it DOES include the final regular season game against New England. I looked at the picture too, and not only does it clearly say ""New England"" but you can also see the end of the date... ""er 29, 2007"" The date of that game was 12/29/07, so this is it as long as the picture is accurate!I recorded all these games on DVD, but I'll certainly buy this set anyway!"
1,Hey NFL...it's 2009!!! Put it out in widescreen and HD!!!,"I am a life long diehard fan for Big Blue, and I was really psyched to see this set.Sadly, I have to give it a 1 star, because it is just NO fun watching a standard def video on an HD setup. At least with standard def films, they up-res to look almost as good. Not this one. It looks terrible on my HD tv, like watching a tape.Reissue it in HD and Widescreen....PLEASE. Now that the NFL has finally gotten in gear with releasing full game broadcasts, they HAVE to go the final step of releasing them in both standard and high-def formats, or it's really not worth doing it at all. Thank you."
4,"A Must for True ""BLUE"" fans!",Complete original broadcasts of all four playoff games (on four separate DVDs) including Super Bowl 42! My only disappointment is the lack of post game coverage at the Super Bowl. Adding the trophy presentation and celebrations would have made a perfect package!
2,Great content; terrible picture,"As a NY Giant fan, I had to have this. However, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the video. We are talking 2008 and the image is worse than my mother's non-HD television! NFL video you are a total rip-off artist. I contacted NFL Films and they basically told me ""too bad""."
3,It's great,"I wish it had more replays, it was almost just like watching the game. I guess I was hoping for additional angles and insights."
4,"Bare Bones package, gets the job done.","This is a basic, unspectacluar package that showcases nothing but the games. You get all the playoff games, plus the NE loss in week 17 that propelled them into the playoffs. Moral victory indeed...I wish these games were presented in widescreen format. The pan and scan format is disappointing, but I'm so happy to just have these games on dvd. Perhaps a Blu Ray down the line? Strahan's SB commentary insightful, funny. Left me wanting more special features though."
4,Very handy advice,"I'm a professional usability analyst, and I got some really useful tips when I opened up my copy of this book recently. More than ever its clear to me that Rubin is an experienced practitioner, with a sensible eye for what works."
4,Delivers on it's promises,The title 'handbook of usability testing' is aptly chosen. The author takes the reader by hand through the process of designing and performing a usability test. The activities are described in sufficient detail for someone to start designing his or her own experiments. And most chapters contain useful tips or ideas on how to design a particular part of the test. However some of the material seems outdated and the section on task design is not very helpful in my personal opinion. All in all a good read though.
3,A jump-start into usability testing,"This handbook is certainly worth the time reading, if not for the very practical examples offered. As a handbook, I would have expected a more scientific approach, but as far as it goes, the examples given make up for it. It gives you examples of acceptance criteria and, for instance, different settings of the usability environment with pro's and con's."
3,Eh....,"I bought this for a class. While it's not very exciting, I suppose it's canononical for the subject area."
3,Great device but....,Had this for two years. Love the functionality ie playing music from my computer work station and being able to easily and quicky turn down the music when someone calls me on the phone.HOWEVER.....The device refuses to start up with the computer and I have to literally unplug and replug or reload the driver for it to work each morning. This is an enormous pain in the .... . The griffin website says that there is a solution but in the end they practically want you to reinstall the operating system because none of their easier solutions work.Don't buy this device unless you are ready for this annoying behaviour.
1,powermate limitations,"IF THE POWERMATE 2.0 SOFTWARE WAS SIMULAR TO SAITEKS SST SOFTWARE SO WE CAN CONTROLL THE KEYSTROKE TIMING THEN I'TS USE CAN BE USABLE FOR ALL KEYBOARD CONTROLL PROGRAMS REGARDLESS. AS OF NOW I CAN USE THEM ONLY FOR ONE PGRM. THE KEY DEPRESSION IS TO BRIEF FOR MY OTHERS.THANKS, ANDREW CORIATY....."
2,"cool idea, bad software",doesn't contorl my audio break out box or my DVD playing softwareMAC G5 10.4 Quadno the intel processor
3,Flakey performance with Mac OS X 10.4.x,"This was among the best USB controller devices I've ever used. I've had it since Mac OS X 10.2 days. However as time went on and driver updates for this device became less frequent, it became unstable. Griffin has not updated the PowerMate driver software for 2 years. Their FAQ support page for this device has not been updated for that long as well. And now it is at a point where some features work and others don't. Sort of a hit or miss scenerio. Forget about getting this device to work on the new MacIntels. Oh Griffin, where art thou. I guess they are lost in the world of iPods. For that is all they develop for these days."
1,does not work with new Inte Dual Core iMac,No response from Griffin Tech support. Very sad.... great product if it worked with my Mac.... but it does not....
3,needs work,"This could be a great product but I am having problems with the driver recognizing the hardware, half the time it works, half the time it doesent, and I have to disable and re-enable the driver for it to work, other than that, this thing rocks, I use it as a volume control only."
2,"Nice concept, falls down in execution","It's a nice concept, I originaly purchased this for 3D development before 3D mice were available. It seems like it would be a nice addition to your system, but frankly the software configuration is so draconian and weird that you'll have a hard time using it for anything other than some default functions. While the new driver for Leopard improves things a lot, it would have been better if this device was directly supported by certain of my 3D apps. Basically, it's just turned into a pretty iTunes/SecondLife controller."
1,Broke after 11 months; replacement broken too,"The hardware went bad after 11 months (the LED failed). Got a replacement under warranty. Either the replacement hardware is broken, or the PowerMate's lame driver software for Mac is to blame. In any case, the PowerMate is in the trash, and Griffin is off my list of decent tech companies."
2,Cool idea..,"but not as useful as it might seem.I found msyelf hardly ever using it. It was mostly just cool to look at.And if you upgrade to Windows Vista. It becomes a paperweight. Griffin (as of this writing) has yet to offer software for Vista, rendering my PowerMate absolutely useless (unless one needs a cool looking paperweight, that is)."
1,"Yes it pulses and glows, but...","I have PowerMate v1.5.3 for a couple of days and I already have several problems with it...1 - When I installed it I had a message telling me that a new version was available... I downloaded it, but when I double clicked on it to re-launch the installation I get AGAIN the same message telling me that a new version was available. It is endless...2 - When I put my PC to hibernate, the PowerMate doesn't always come back to life after switching on again the computer. I had to re-install it completely to make it work.3 - When I reboot my computer, the PowerMate icon in the system tray appears with a black sign on it telling that it is not active, and it is not active! So I have to unplug/replug the USB to make it active...4 - And ultimately I am still expecting an answer (or any sign) from Griffin Technologies support about these major issues.PS: I installed PowerMate on Windows XP Pro SP2"
2,Does not work for tempest mame,"This does not work for tempest in mame. It does not have a real mouse driver and does not produce raw events. Mame uses raw keyboard/mouse events and does not see anything from this device.I tried sending left/right keyboard events and left/right mouse events. That did not work.It will work with mame version .90 (I tested that) but that version does not do a good job rendering tempest.For applications that do not read raw events it works like a champ. I will find a use for it in my home theater, whether it is controlling my receiver or lights... but for mame, it is useless. Really a shame because it is a slick device."
1,It is awful,It sounds raw. Not only is the recording aweful but so is the music. It was not the standard level of PSB sophisitication I am used to hearing. Don't buy this CD.
2,"Terrible Writing, Good art","I suppose this comic TPB would be great if you couldn't read and just looked at the pictures. The artwork is solid and detailed. The problem is with the writing. It seems like writer Chuck Austen always wanted to write Spiderman and got stuck with Supes. The plot is scattershot and Superman spends his time making lame one-liners. There is a contrived sub-plot with Clark Kent being demoted and neither his boss or his wife will tell him about it. The soap opera BS of Lana Lang's pining for Clark and questioning of Lois Kent's commitment to her husband was pathetically weak. And there was the inexplicable fight sequence mixed in with that sub-plot that had nothing to do with anything. What was that all about? Zero stars for writing and 4 for art. If you want to have some cool pictures for your kid to look at, pick this up. If you want to read a Superman trade that is up to expected standards, forget it."
4,Filled with suspense and intrigue.,"George Dawes Green dropped me into his world of intrigue and suspense and kept me there to the very last page.The day after I completed the final chapter, I viewed the movie and was disappointed in both the dialogueand the characters lack of depth . The book was more intense and the storyline held my focus much more thanthe screen version. Once you spiral into the realm of the psychotic behavior of Green's character""the Teacher"", I believe you will be held there until the end.I highly recommend this book"
3,WHAT'S THE SCORES GEORGE DAWES?,"A real page turner, but too contrived.The ""teacher"" is a mafia hit man who proves to be invulnerable and invincible. In fact this aspect becomes very tiresome as no matter what ploy is set against him, the teacher manages to win. Of course we know that he's going to get his in the end, but it is a long time coming. By the time it happens I had lost a bit of interest.Nevertheless this is a well written and thought provoking book. It's not great literature, so don't expect any intricate and dazzling sentence constuction or imagery; it's a little plain in it's writing. But if crime and thrill is your game then you wont be disapointed.This was a very good first book for the author, but I am sure he can improve on his writing style."
5,The best book I have every read.,"The author wrote ""The Juror"" very well. He knows how to get your hair standing on end. The suspense in this book is almost unbearable."
5,Amazing,"After reading Ravens, http://www.amazon.com/Ravens-George-Dawes-Green/dp/0446538973/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1279287512&sr;=1-3 , by the same other, I knew I had to scoop up everything he had written.George Dawes Green is an extremely talented writer, Ive never read anything quite like his books. He literally keeps you on your toes and when you think you have everything figured out, he flips the world upside down! I love all of his books and I most definitely recommend them! In fact I came onto amazon.com to purchase more copies as Christmas gifts last year and everyone recipient loved the books!"
3,Gripping legal thriller,"Synopsis:Single mother, struggling sculptor, and newly selected juror Annie Laird doesn't realize her danger when she agrees to participate in the murder trial of mob boss Louie Buffano. This changes quickly enough when Annie meets ""the Teacher,"" a handsome, dangerous and volatile member of Buffano's familia. The Teacher makes it immediately apparent that if she agrees to cooperate, he can help make her career. If she refuses to do so, her life and that of her son may be forfeit. The tension rises as Annie struggles to find a way to save her family without giving in to the Teacher's increasing demands.Review:If the plot sounds vaguely familiar, you may have watched the 1996 movie version with Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin. The audiobook is equally fast paced and absorbing without the strength of Alec Baldwin's portrayal of the Teacher and the weaknesses of Demi Moore's Annie Laird. Overall, The Juror is action packed, suspenseful and highly entertaining."
3,"Entertaining, suspenseful -- a good read.","I'm pretty stingy with my 4 & 5 star recommendations; so take that in consideration!One of the most interesting aspects of this book - one quite surprising to me - was the subtle humor delivered deftly by some of the characters. Some of Slavko's thoughts and comments made me laugh out loud & share them with my husband.I was fascinated & also repulsed by The Teacher - probably just as the author intended.Well written, a QUICK read. I would have liked a little more character development with a few of the characters - makes me wonder if the author had a ""page-thirsty"" editor!Sign me -- a 40-year-old avid reader"
1,I'm baffled at the positive reviews,"I read it...voluntarily. It wasn't recommended to me, but I found it lying around, and I had the time. When it didn't drag on in excessive details, it was too vague, too wordy, too something in every aspect. I compare this book to Milk Money (By the way, you're better off staring at a wall for 2 hours than watching that movie).Okay, I'll give it something. I did watch the movie before I read the book, so I did know the ending, and recognized most parts...Jeez, I hope that's it, because, if its not, you people (for the most part) are quite misled."
2,Only Partly plausible,"The premise, jury tampering, is plausible and smacks of John Grisham's The Runaway Jury, with a twist at the end of the trial. It is at this twist that I feel the author takes leave of reality and slips into fantasy where the all-knowing villain can bug, anything, track anything and thwart any attempt to capture him, without explaining how all this was accomplished. A little foray into cults, a little sex and a lot of violence make this novel less plausible"
4,Excellent thriller with a strong character in The Teacher,"A brilliantly readable piece of work. Doesn't seem like only a second bookPersonally I feel the book is made more readablebeacause of the brilliant chracterisation of the Teacher,the Mafia fixit man.His sheer brilliance and personality make u want to find out more and more about himWhat makes him Tick is what will keep u going.Buy itRead itand thank me lateremail at aptechch@giaspn01.vsnl.net.in"
2,exciting but not satisfying,"This is a 1995 legal ""thriller"" which involves intimidation of a woman juror on a mobster's murder trial. The trial scenes are handled correctly , and the judge handles the juror's attempt to talk to him ex parte as he ethically had to. But the trial's end does not end the book by a long shot, and the events become increasingly wild and bloody. The author felt he had to sprinkle pornographic events in the story, which add nothing to the story and are mainly repulsive and make one less sympathetic to the women characters involved. There is a fast pace to the story but it goes on and on, with many people dying, including some characters one would have hoped would not. But I cannot think the novel a succcess"
5,Super Mug,"I love my Beach mug. It holds more then traditional tall mugs, so less refills are needed. I ordered two so as to have a back-up, but my boss loved mine so much I gifted it to her."
1,This game will NOT work on an Xbox 360!!!!!,I bought this game not knowing that it wouldn't work on an Xbox 360. It will only work on an original Xbox. I found this out the hard way so just be forewarned. There are no updates or downloads to make this game playable on the Xbox 360!!!Highly disappointed that this wasn't mentioned in the description on Amazon....
2,Journey into Pop,"Ant has attempted to enter mainstream pop with this release, with tightly written, commercially palatable tunes.This attempt often fails to succeed in various points throughout the disk, as the compositional strengths of Ant do not seem to fit the pop mold. Other times it connects, such as ""Going for Broke"", which sounds almost like Mike + the Mechanics, and ""Love in a Hot Air Balloon."" Here though, the lyrics walk a fine line between quaint and silly while the tune is quite catchy. Some of the tracks seem strained in trying to be ""poppish"" and are downright unlistenable, but as you are about to give up, you find some true gems, like ""My Time has Come"" and ""Ballad of Penlee.""Thus this CD is quite hard to rate, and others are like not as harsh. I'd give it 2 1/2 but I put two since I can't give 1/2's. ""Wise After the Event"" it ain't in terms of originality and creativity."
3,Good considering time era,"When I bought this LP back in the 80s I have to say I was in agreement with the negative reviewers from the past. I listened to this a few times and just had to throw on the shelf. In the late 90s I listened to this again and I have to say the song writing and musicianship here is better than most of the shlock that came out in that era. Listening to it in that perspective rather than topping ""Wise and After the Event"" made me appreciate it much better. Check out his latest release ""Field Day"". More acoustic guitar but definetely my favorite so far."
1,stinker,"Oh, god. Not only does it sound dated (cheesy techno-pop sounds, not all that well produced in the first place) but the songs are AWFUL. If you want a good ""rock"" album from Ant, Sides is highly recommended. Don't get this one."
1,"Anthony Phillips tries to go pop, but just doesn't know how","I've owned 11 Anthony Phillips albums over the years. This is the only one I felt the need to unload, because I knew I would NEVER feel the urge to hear it again. Phillips was looking for some pop success, but like many prog-rock musicians in the early 80s, he figured that the way to pop from his lofty sphere was to dummy down, and ended up with something that's condescending to pop fans, off-putting to prog-rock fans, and boring to both. The songs just aren't very good. To hear Phillips at his best, look for ""Wise After the Event"", with ""Sides"" and ""The Geese and the Ghost"" as fallbacks if you can't find it.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,Broad approach,This book covers a large scope of musicians and technicians who were involved in electronic and electric music from the early 1900's to the present day. It is written in a fairly comprihensive style and centres upon the impacts that technology has had upon c20 music. A facinating read. Highly recommended for broad insights into the intentions of most electronic composers. I was rather happy to see a brief section on DJ Olive actually - this shows that Homles does not merely wish to stick to mentioning composers that the masses often only know by name. Splendid stuff. Couldn't find much wrong with it really. Take a preview of the contents page for yourself for a general idea.
1,"Save some money, You cannot print or export information","If you want to save some money and some frustration, stay away from this software... why? You cannot print of export unless you buy a `Business' license (119 USD at Handango), plus the 44.95 you already paid. So you are obliged to only see things in one computer, you can only connect one phone... and forget about the rest... After wasting my money here I downloaded MobilEdit! (25 USD) And you can export even with the trial version... But you do not have to believe me, try it yourself..."
1,Rack becomes disassembled,"I purchased the rack also. The rods on the 3rd and 4th rod constantly comeapart. I glued them into the slots but they became unglued. ALSO, whenyou close the door (with the rack on it), the shoes fall off."
3,"This book is a classic, but a poor guide to coin values.","David Sear is probably the best known living authority on ancient coins, especially Roman coins. If a collector only owned one book on Roman coins, this would be the one. However, the values reported in his book for coins (supposedly those that grade approximately ""Very Fine"") only roughly correlate with market prices. Coin dealers often like to quote prices from Sear's book, especially if the book price exceeds the normal market value."
2,Where Are The Rest?,"I was taught about the 'bids & bees"" with these books when I was 12. These books are filled with GREAT information & are very easy to follow. Problem is: I ordered the books from here & only received ONE!!!! Where are the rest?? This was supposed to be a 4 book set! HELP ME OUT HERE Winter Ventures Customer Service"
1,dont waist your money,not worth it at all. you can find 8 inch speakers that sound better than this for a fraction of the price!!
3,A great book for scene work,"I saw a scene from this play in a scene book for actors but it was required that I also read the whole play before performing it. Overall the play is ok. The depth of the characters is very good. I chose a scene from this play because of the three-dimensional quality of the charaters. William Snyder shows much of the heartache of Beebee Fenstermaker. In the end, you are really feeling sympathy for her. This may not be a pulitzer prize winning drama, but if you need some scenes to perform, this has a few gems in it. :o)"
1,A bit pricey,"Maybe I am naive, but for this price, I expected 2 pillow shams. Intersting the packaging says shams (plural) but the website listing correctly shows 1 sham. For $49.99 you could buy a king size quilt and make 8 shams. I dont feel one sham is worth $19.99. Your mileage may vary."
1,A big waste of money.,All this CD did was try to get you to purchase more of his stuff. What a waste of money.
1,Kevin Trudeau wants your money,"I have personally not heard this cd, but I have sold these to many people at one of Kevin's conventions. This cd has sold btw $500-$25. If it is so great then why is the cost fluctuating so much? This guy is a scammer and wants your money. The FDA shut him down because his products do not work! Just google his name and you'll find out more information about his shady dealings. Yea, I know he has 'seen the light.' But I think he is seeing a green light from all the money he is making."
5,Best low-carb bar out there,"All I can say is that staying on a low-carb diet is much easier with these bars. They have an unbelieveable 19g of protein, only 210 calories, tons of fiber, and they are filling. I have never had any other ""nutrition"" bar and felt full afterwards until this one. I think they taste just fine, but of course, they don't taste like a Hershey bar either, so don't have unrealistic expectations of taste and you'll be happy. I have lost 15 pounds and been able to keep it off, and these bars give me a snack that makes it easy to control my carbs at work, at home, and on the go."
1,"Awful, just awful","I like the South Beach chocolate peanut butter meal replacement bars, but the chocolate crisp and the vanilla one are inedible."
1,They were better before!,I used to love these bars so I ordered them on here so I could have a big supply (without realizing it was a new formula)... only to later realize that now it has sugar in it (it used to be sugar free) and the amount of protein was reduced! So not only am I getting less protein but I'm getting a whole lot more sugar! ugh! so disappointed. I only had two bars before I realized this so now I a box of bars just sitting there.
5,Great,These taste very good - considering that they are meal replacement bars. I eat them for breakfast and they fill me up until lunch - they are filling because they have 19 grams of protein
2,Not as good as before,"It's a smaller bar now and doesn't taste as good as before. Wonder if the ingredients are also different...I still eat them when I am really hungry and there is no other food around, but I don't enjoy eating this bar."
2,Doesn't work!,"The premise of this bag is that it spins the water from your salad and it does, however, if you have tomatoes, cucumbers or any other vegie that has a fair amount of liquid in it the bag spins some of that away too leaving you with a mushy mess. If all you use it for is greens - lettuce, spinach, etc. - it is OK, but not for a salad. I bought the green bags and those work great for single veges as well as a salad so I'll buy them again but I will not buy these again. They're pricy and can only be reused a couple times and only for greens."
5,great space saver,"We just moved into a temp. condo and this is the answer for our salads, given our space limitations"
4,Veggie spinner,"These bags are great. Get the excess water off your lettuce and veggies and they take don't take up any cabinet space. The lettuce stays crisp if you store in them, as well."
3,Idea is great but does not really work,"The bag has a L shape drain pocket that collects water from the main compartment where you put the vegetables. Sadly plastic bags have a tendency to collapse or cling, especially in narrow area (the L shape pocket). When it does, the water stop sipping through. I need to rub the pocket and let some air in so water can come down from the main compartment.It doesn't work as well as a salad spinner, but it's better than a simple colander. Since it's light weight and doesn't take any space, it is ideal for camping or traveling."
5,SPIN & STORE BAGS,IT WORKS REAL GOOD FOR WHAT I NEEDED IT FOR. YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE TROUBLE IF WET LETTUCE.
2,disappointed,"I found this product to be a waste of my money. I initially was drawn to it for the convenience of saving cabinet space needed for a traditional salad spinner (I managed to warp mine in the dishwasher). With the bag, the water does get extracted to the chamber (further drying needed with a paper towel), however the produce does not keep for long in the fridge, especially romaine lettuce and spinach. Better results with Kale, however even that did not keep as long as when I used the traditional spinner and stored the produce in the spinner while refrigerated. Additionally, as one other review noted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to thoroughly clean the bag after use. I would not recommend this product."
5,Tolkien is an amateur by comparison,"I think this is the best of the 10, closely followed by the Witchlord and the Weaponmaster. The interaction of the characters amongst all of novels is fantastic. The whole potential post apocalyptic theme (through the swarms) could be further explored - which as far as I am aware has not been done yet.Where is volume 11?"
2,nonstop 'adventure' sinks into boredom...,"I'm a sucker for vintage SF. The Planet Stories series of books looked very interesting, and as a first I bought this book based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon. This book might have been ok decades ago for readers who never read any of the better SF/fantasy works before encountering this one. But unlike many classic vintage SF, this book just doesn't measure up today. The book contains a huge number of 'adventures', but around halfway in the book, after the 357th miraculous escape/victory I just didn't care any more. There was no tension or excitement. The characters are not likeable or interesting either, so I wasn't rooting for them. Overall the book was a big letdown, and I'm afraid that if this book reflects the average quality of the Planet Stories series, then this was the last one I bought."
3,star wars clone wars figure: General Grievous,I bought this toy yesterday. I saw the cartoonetwork show and remembered the character. When I got home i was disgusted!! It doest have many points of articulation! The lightsabers that come with it break easily if not careful. They should have made it move more. It is fun and all but i was ashamed! There were scatches from head to toe! I would recomend you buy the movie verson
2,5 Sabers anyone?,"I think this Grievous looks much better than the movie fig, but he only has too arms. The whole thing that makes Grievous cool is his 4 arms. I want a clone wars Grievous that I can set up with 4 sabers in arms and one in a foot like in Chapter 20."
3,WWF Survivor Series 1990 review,"The Warriors-The Perfect Team match was not great but pretty good. The Million Dollar Team-The Dream Team match was a short but sweet. The Visionaries-The Vipers match was nothing more then a one-sided flop. The Hulkmaniacs-The Natural Disasters match while not a bad bout,it had an ending of Hogan winning that you could see coming a mile away. The Allance-The Mercenaries match was also not great but pretty good with ending that leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The Grand Finale Of Survival match was nothing more then a mindless filler. The Debut of The Gobbledy Gooker was nothing more then a ""Big Lipped Alligator Moment"". I give this PPV a 6 out of 10."
1,Junk,I have had a positive experience with Gilmour. Gilmour's 20 Series Platinum 8 Ply Flexogen Hose 5/8 Inch is an excellent piece of equipment. Their Advanced Oscillating Sprinkler is not. It never functioned correctly right out of the box. It's called advanced but the parts that matter are cheap plastic. Buyer beware.
2,Please fix the typos!!!!! And then republish this book!!,The typos in this book are truly atrocious.I have corrections identified for almost every page.This is a shame since the book gathers together (in one place) a large amount of useful information that can't be found elsewhere.Can't these people afford an editor??
1,not worth the money,this book was the most unedited book i have ever read.it is not worth the paper it is printed on
3,wanted more visual history,I was expecting more visual historical documentation and a lot less focus on the people presenting their case during the dvd.
5,ridiculous comments on Felicity Lott's age,"I saw the operette only in live performance - and was very impressed.Reading the comments here on amazon.com left me rather shocked by how much the public is fixated on age (a match between their phantasy and reality) instead of content or message. This was a perfect piece of art with a very powerful message of its own.Reading the comments on Dame Lott's age makes me wonder whether we are really in the 21st century, where supposedly prejudices againstwomen are much less severe than in other centuries.I think that those who critise her age just did not understand the layers in the message of the piece, and I am sorry for having to live at an age where so many individuals still have not grown intellectually and emotionally. Can anyone recommend me where I can immigrate to?"
2,"Wonderful operetta, wonderful production, fatal flaw","Offenbach wrote a whole slew of wonderful, witty operettas.This one is typical, a funny witty farce.Minkowski has a terrific vision for the piece and the staging updates the action with a grab bag of jokes and double entendres.But there is a terrible, fatal flaw in this DVD. Couldn't they find someone else for the title role? La Belle Helene, the most beautiful woman in the world, played by an aging, over the hill,overacting ""soprano"". Not only does Lott look her age but she sounds it.Her tone is hard, glassy, and very brittle. She overacts in a very arch, mannered style.This is such a shame as it's a fun piece, and imaginative production and except for the fatal flaw, a terrific ensemble of a cast.It's impossible to believe that the Trojan War was fought over this Helen."
1,Great Expectations Dashed,"I was not familiar with this operetta, but I thought Harnoncourt and the Zurich Opera has got to be good. Unfortunately, it was hard to see past the silly costumes, which turned me right off."
1,"La Belle Helene, Offenbach","Quality recording very good.The opera is silly, makes no sense. I own approximately one hundred and fifty opera recordings on DVD, this was without any doubt the wrost."
5,Great ! ! !,"This is a wonderful production. Felicity Lott lost some of her past vocal quality, but she is an amazing comic actress and the concept of the production suits her admirably. The rest of the cast is outstanding too. Minkowski knows how to extract all the fun and wit in Offenbach spirited music, and the director, Laurent Pelly is one of the most talented opera directors active today. Don't miss it! It is a gem!"
5,amazing ghosts photographs and a good storyline.,I found the ghost story interesting. The author keeps the story unfolding by telling her experince talking to the ghost and telling the ghost's story.
1,This is a book?,"I bought this because the author was signing books at a bookstore in my area. It is awful, the writing is amateurish and the pictures look like photos of ordinary window reflections. I would have gotten my money back, but she autographed the book and the store would not take it back."
1,A first draft of a manuscript,The poor presentation of the material leaves in doubt the veracity of the subject matter and the writing ability of the author. The one star rating is generous.
1,Poorly written psychobabble....,"A friend from Georgia sent me this book. Basically, it is a bunch of pictures of trees reflected in window panes that are supposed to be ghosts the author knows. This is supplemented by writing that is disjointed, and in some cases, non-grammatical. If you want to hear the meanderings of a kook who claims to talk to ghosts, this is the book for you."
1,So bad it is almost good,"This has got to be among the worst written books in the history of literature. The sentences are non-grammatical, the spelling is awful, and the ghosts photographs are reflections of light in window panes. However, I will give credit where credit is due. The author has achieved some degree of notriety due to the inept quality of the book, if such a thing is possible. If you like to laugh, and can pick up a used copy of this for a dollar or two, you should do so."
1,Is this a humor book?,"You have to laugh - sentences that are not grammatical, poor typesetting, and a subject that is far-fetched. The author obviously is seeking attention, and is not ashamed as to how she does so. I knew the book was self-published after reading a couple of pages. Ms. Setran, please learn to spell ""grammAr"" and ""experiEnce."" Your self-written ""reviews"" have the same mispellings as your book."
1,Its funny how....,"....the five star reviewers seem to have the same dyslexia the author does. Bottom line, if you are going to sell books, they need to be good books. This book is poorly written, and the story is not believable. All the excuses in the world can be made, but that's the bottom line. Save your money."
4,GREAT OOK,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR KIDS AND, ADULTS WHO KNOW LITTE ABOUT, CHIEF SEATTLE. NICELY ILLUSTRATED, TOO!!"
1,Do you care about truth?,"This book was on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list for 17 weeks before that newspaper (April 1992) felt compelled to run a FRONT PAGE story explaining that ""Chief Seattle"" never spoke the words attributed to him in this book. Only one kind of reader will care, those who love the truth. Others (read Liberals and God-haters) will have no problem with this book, which is why it still sells well. Read all about this subterfuge in Reader's Digest July 1993, volume 143, issue 855 pages 100 to 104."
1,"Do not buy this, its not worth the frustration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is the worst rc car i ever bought. i bought this and the other version for 30 bucks EACH.1 was defective and wouldnt charge and even the working 1 stunk. It took 3 feet to turn around and was xtremely slow. I would recommend getting the regular microsizers because 1 they work, 2 they are fast, and 3 they turn. I gave it 5 stars for educational because i learned not to buy 1 again!!! Other things broke so its not durable. Dont believe the commercials, they try to make it look good!!!"
5,"Great book, great author.",In my opinion Chuck Swindoll is one of the best at expressing illustrations to believers. This book was for my husband to use in teaching his Sunday bible class
4,"Potent drama, indeed!","Bernardo Bertolucci after having shaken the world with his Last Tango in Paris, presents us with a raw emotional and affective picture involves a weak son confronted with the highly successful nature mother, a renowned opera singer, happily married until a tragedy occurs. A heart attack ended the life of her husband. From the desolate state of solitude, both are enclosed within their emotional shells. But the son seeks refuge in drugs and not to lose it, has made a determination. But there is still a secret from the past to unravel.Bertolucci unleashes his feverish love of Opera Itaiana and complete this existential framework with some pieces magnificently assembled into this terrible and distressing dramatis personae.Jill Claybough (April 30, 1944 - November 5, 2010) was always one of my favorite actresses in her generation. Her role is fascinating, compelling and nuanced with complete spontaneity.An original masterwork."
4,Good enough that I bought 4 of them,"I have four of these on my desk in portrait mode, mounted on Ergotron stands. The stands HP ships are nice enough that I've re-used them to mount other VESA monitors in my office.The display panel is decent. Colors are roughly on par with my Apple 30"" display. I bought this panel because it has the closest color and dimensions to match the Apple display.The panels have dual DVI inputs and come with 2 DVI cables and 2 SVGA/DVI adapter cables. The shipping boxes are large and sturdy, which reflect the build quality of the monitor and the stand. The monitor case is plastic, but it feels robust compared to some of the cheaper panels out there.The on-screen controls are reasonably good and make sense. If you're looking for a 1600x1200 non-widescreen 20"", this is one of the few panels left on the market."
3,Wish it was better,"Pluses: Image is sharp, color is quite good if viewed from straight ahead. Display has height adjustment, rotates and can be swiveled.Minuses: Very noticeable color shift if not viewed from straight ahead, though the image does not completely disappear as happens on some other lcd displays. Black turns purple. Seems to be quite a lot of ""bleed"" from the backlight, though I don't know what is typical for LCD display. A kind of ""shimmer"" viewable on most images (maybe backlight bleed?).I bought based on good reviews for color and viewing angle. It turned out to be not nearly as good as described."
1,Two defective shipments,"The first Lenmar 450W inverter I received failed to power up when connected to a battery. The replacement did power up, but the display was broken (some parts of the readout were unresponsive), and the packaging was sliced (not open, but not a great sign) on arrival. My boyfriend has had this same item since 2009, and after using his I thought this purchase was a safe bet, but something is obviously off about the current manufactures.Also notable: the image on this page is inaccurate. The actual product body is gray with a lighter gray inset around the power button and readout, which was as I expected after comparing the product number with the item I used before being disappointed by these."
1,wrong items,we thought they were colored contact lenses but itd ok it was our mistake and who knows we may need thenm
4,Smeg!,It's finally over. This entire series is great although it shows some age here in the last chapters. A must have for any true Dwarfer!
3,Not as bad as some have said,"OK, so this isn't the finest season of Red Dwarf. But I held off buying it for a while based on some of the reviews. Really, it's not as bad as some reviews would have you believe. The writing is not as crisp as in the previous series, and I wasn't entirely thrilled with the ""resurrect the crew and throw the gang in prison"" plot line.But it has it's moments, and it's still worth watching if you've seen the rest of the series."
3,Red Dwarf VIII,"I only have one question...WHERE IS SERIES 9!!!!!!!???C'mon already, It's been long enough."
5,The best season,The show is stupid and silly but super funny. This is the funniest season of thme all. You will have to watch it twice to laugh at what you missed.
5,Great Message,A near-death experience causes the main character to re-examine her life. This uplifting tale is one about not having any regrets.
4,cute!,"This book is an interesting twist on an old story. The basis of the story is how a big brother picks on and teases his little sibling (in this case a little brother), but is still loved and admired by the sibling. The interesting part of this story, though, is that the characters in the book are monsters! No need to be afraid, though, as the monsters are not scary, but actually cute! The little monsters enjoy the same things that human kids do, but of course, with a monster-like twist! The illustrations are very enjoyable, and it is fun to find the ""strange"" items in each drawing. Parents may be a little disturbed by the the bad manners of the bigger brother, but it can lead to a discussion of good manners!"
2,Not new as claimed,"I was supposed to receive a book that was claimed to be new as there might have been an overstock or something. However, when the book arrived, the edges had dog ears and the paper was kind of old and yellow. The book cover was also a little dirty. So disappointed especially since my purchase was intended as a gift for someone."
4,Marxhall Tucker in all its greatness,"I was in 8th grade in 1976 when my older brother brought this album home, first I'd heard of MTB. Awesome then, awesome now. Marshall Tucker band in all their greatness."
2,Not worth the price.,The chain is rather thin and almost white looking rather than silvery. I had to return it because it was not worth $80 and the ring of the lobster clasp was missing. Dealing with the seller was a problem. I did not get a response for return authorization until I reported them to Amazon. Now I am waiting for my money to be returned after 4 weeks. What is going on with this seller. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
3,"Nice looking chain, but color not silver","This is a nicely made, solid chain and works well with heavier pendants. However it is very white in color, not a true silver color at all-- so it looks a little ""off"" with a silver pendant hanging from it"
2,"no a true 9""","the bracelet was not a true 9 "" the necklace perfect the bracelet nice quality just not true to length"
3,Silver Chain Beautiful but Construction Around Clasp was Weak.,"The rope chain was beautiful and had a nice weight and sheen to it, but it fell apart at the clasp and I had to have it re-soldered which cost me $25. Now that it is repaired, I love it."
4,Lila's Story~,"Well, this book is about Lila. As a person who likes her a lot, I found this book portrayed her just as she is, snobby, rich, daddy's girl. But also, she showed mature instincts, hurt, betrayal, human emotions. And, as a Lila, Bruce fan, any book with both of them appearing appeals to me. And I like the ending, because Lila get's her father's respect, as well as revenge!"
4,Excellent fantasy primer,"'Legends' is a great primer to the worlds of epic fantasy. Silverberg did a great job compiling so many diverse authors to contribute. Let's get into it.King's Little Sisters wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It showcased once again King's inability to develop good characters.Pratchett's story...easily the worst of the bookTerry Goodkind..a nice story. I hadn't read any of his novels previously but I'll give them a chance after reading this. A bit too simplistic though..with the good guy prevailing.Good stories from McCaffrey, Martin, Feist, and Jordan and especially LeGuin. 'Dragonfly' by Le Guin is a masterful story. Each and every word jumps off the page. It well-deserves the award nominations it received.The only disappointments were the aforementioned Pratchett's story and Tad Williams 'Burning Man'. Williams' 1st person narration disrupted the flow of the rest of the book."
3,Amazon misled me,"I, like another, thought I was purchasing a book with 11 short stories with some of my favorite authors. I was disappointed to find ONLY 4 of the stories in this version. I went awry with the description in the Editorial Review, Amazon.com by Craig Engler, printed in conjunction with this text. Please include more accurate information!"
4,Make sure you get the full version paperback!,There are 2 versions of this book in paperback. One has 4 stories (which unfortunately I bought by mistake) and the other has all 11 stories. I did enjoy 3 out of the 4 stories in the version I bought especially Stephen Kings and Raymond Feist.
1,What a rip-off,"The original hardcover printing of this book featured 11 (I think) stories. Now the paperback collection finally arrives, and it only contains FOUR of the eleven, with the note that two more collections containing the rest of the stories will soon be available, thereby asking you to shell out more bucks! This is ridiculous!!! All of the stories in the hardcover could have easily fit into one paperback, but of course it's difficult when the ""large-print-trick"" is employed as it is here. Commercialism strikes again..."
5,An amazing short story,"I would have to say Robert Jordan's submission to Legends is perhaps his best work. This was a short story, about 80 pages. It was almost a completely new writing style. Gone were his repetitive descriptions and explanations. For this story, Jordan assumes the Reader has read the series and creates a much more fast paced and interesting plot. It is also a change to able to finish one of his stories in one day. All of the information remains fresh, I never struggled to remember why something was happening. Additionally the plot was well constructed. Reading about Moraine and Lan while they were younger was quite interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Robert Jordan's writing."
3,Inconsistent Quality,"This appears to be a vehicle for TOR to get more books sold. I think these authors are just selling out and pushing short stories from thier already successful series to attract more readers.While all the authors are true to their styles and series, not all the authors are of the same caliber."
4,Discover new authors,"This book is a collection of novellas by authors who have gained some sort of acclaim in the genre of fantasy. If any of the featured authors are a favorite of ours, then you can't go wrong with the book. Not only will you have the latest installment in your favorite universe, but you will also discover new fantasy authors.I got the book for George R. R. Martin's ""The Hedge Knight"" and am now looking forward to reading Tad William's books.Another plus: A story by Jordan the is less than 100 pages long.Warning: There exists a paperback version of this book which only contains 4 of the 11 stories. Avoid it, as it omits some of the best ones."
2,Masters of fantasy without fantasy,"This anthology has the subtitle ""Masters of fantasy"", but the stories in it are neither masterful nor fantastic. Of the eleven short stories, only LeGuin's story truly deserves the subtitle with its beautiful language and sense of magic. Pratchett and Jordan shows solid handiwork; Pratchett giving insights in witchcraft, headology and the personality of Esmeralda Weatherwax and Jordan with a well-paced prequel to his Wheel of Time books.Of the rest, only Martin's story is decent. While it's well-written and original it is totally lacking any feeling of fantasy. The rest either lack fantasy feeling (Feist, McCaffrey, Silverberg), are cliched (King, McCaffrey), simply badly written (Feist) or manage to roll all the bad points of every other story into a big heap whose only virtue is showing everything that can be done wrong with epic fantasy (Goodkind).I never managed to finish the stories by Card or Williams."
3,Monster 3250 Reviews,"I have owned three Monster Power 3250 amps over the last 5 years. The are definitely worth the money for both home theater and music listening. My only concern is that all three amps have experienced problems. Two of the 3250 amps had switching problems develop around year three where after the amp was on for 15 minutes, it would switch on and off for about 5 minutes before continuing to stay on without any subsequent problems. The third amp blew one of the three mono blocks which is a plus and minus. The plus is that the amp is designed with three mono block channels that are independent of each other so the other two channels still were fine, the minus is that this happened at all. Despite these problems, I almost purchased a fourth Monster Power amp but decided this time to go Adcom."
1,"Please, Don't Waste Your Money!!!","Bottom of the barrel as far as autobiographies go. (Only Kelsey Grammer's was worse!!) Does America really care that this two-bit 'celeb' was considering undergoing breast surgery because at 45 she can no longer ace the 'pencil test'? Ugh! Save me from that visual! And her love life! Summertime flings with a boy a generation younger; financially bilked by an Irish gigalo. Is desperate & stupid tattooed under those bangs? The slim volume is one big, ""Who cares?"" Destined for Remainder Hell as soon as it was printed. The book in neither funny nor enlightening. ""Heir apparent"" to Erma Bobeck indeed. Please don't confuse this drivel with genuine writing talent. An hour and a half is all it takes to read, so please save your dollars for a quality autobiography. The ultimate appeal is only for QVC addicts, no one else needs to bother."
4,We should all be so determined and disciplined!,"""I've been lucky, very lucky. In fact, we should all be so lucky,"" says Kathy Levine. Actually, Kathy Levine sets clear goals and takes action to achieve them. When she makes mistakes, many of which she details in this book, she refuses to be crushed, and gets up and tries again. This was a pleasant read, chatty and truthful, like a letter from a relative you haven't seen in a long while."
3,Still interesting...,"This is Kathy's second ""authobiography"" coauthored with Jane Scovill. I would say that this book is not as JUICY as her 1st book, but still very interesting ONLY if you are a QVC/Kathy Levine fan already. Kathy is as honest as Kathy can be. She still will not say anything negative about QVC or any of the guests/hosts since she still is gainfully employed by QVC. And I think some of her experiences with men are nothing out of the ordinary for us really ordinary women."
1,"I didn't like it either, but. . .",Why anyone would spend money on Levine's book just to find out what happened to some peripheral character with whom she once worked is beyond me.
1,Pushiness Personified,"Kathy does it again with this book, and in the process thereof manages to maintain her pushy, obnoxious demeanor."
1,What was she thinking?,"I do not understand why Kathy Levine would think there would be a single person who would care about her life. When I saw this book in the bookstore I almost broke out laughing. If you've ever seen Kathy Levine on TV, you know she's a rather rude, pushy, obnoxious woman. If that is what you like, this book will certainly not disappoint -- it is plenty rude and obnoxious. Buy it in the bargain bin for a dollar and give it as a Christmas gift to someone you hate."
4,"Very, very bright","My only complaint is the cables could be longer (I had to be very creative when running the cables on my '04 Jeep Wrangler). Other than that, they're very bright and instantly turn night into day."
3,POOR RECORDING BUT GOOD,ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY WHAT PATTON IS SAYING BUT ITS THERE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I HAVE TO SAY IT IS A GOOD RECORDING. THAT DARK HAUNTING AND EERIE SOUND IS PART OF THE BLUES AND NO ONE DID IT BETTER FOR HIS TIME THAN CHARLEY PATTON HIMSELF. HE WAS THE BEST AND THE PEOPLE THAT FOLLOWD AFTER HIM INCLUDING ROBERT JOHNSON SHOW HE WAS A MAN OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IVE WALWAYS SAID IF ANY ONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THEY SHOULD LISTEN TO THE GREATONES AND CHARLEY WAS JUST THAT SO ILL GIVE 3 1/2 STARS TO A VERY GOOD COLLECTION. OH AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO BUY OTHER RECORDINGS OF HIS WORK FORGET IT THIS IS THE BEST REMASTERD AND RESTORED COLLECTION OF HIS WORK ON THE MARKET.
4,Charley box set,"The music is great. Some of the recordings are pretty grainy, but I don't really mind that so much. But each disk has songs from other people. I don't know why... this was supposed to be a Charley Patton box set. But it does have all his recordings so you are getting what you pay for. In a sense you get a little extra with the other tracks from other artist... but I would prefer the set without them."
5,the voice throwing blues!!!!!!!!!,"ive been listening to patton for years, and this collection is one the best 5cd collections ever made, and let me point out the voice throwing blues,, one the best songs ive ever heard,, its not patton singing, but whoever it is, its great, he does half regular voice, and the other half sounds like hes singing through a megaphone,, its the coolest thing ive ever heard on a pre ww2 track, it sounds like hes singing through some ancient effect box(and i love effects!!)"
3,Interesting -But,We all know the problem with the quality of the earliest recordings of the Blues. Even the most ardent fan will have struggled with the extraneous noise that all but obliterates the recording on many of the surviving originals. Chalie Pattons work is wonderful but struggles to appear from the background mush. The recordings may have been remastered but would have benefited from better application of digital noise reduction techniques.Having said that this set is good value for the money.
3,Good price; fair sound; borrowed sources?,"There are both good and bad things about this set. The 5 discs of very rare and valuable material make up a rather incredible compilation. The layout of the inserts is somewhat user-friendly; requiring the listener to pull individual CDs out in order to locate artists. The discography information does not include song titles, which causes a lot of back-and-forth cross-reading. A little confusing.The sound quality is only fair; when I compare these to Yazoo reissues, I feel like there is no presence in the JSP versions. Too much treble has been rolled off.My biggest concern is that I believe I recognize many of these remastered sides from other reissues. A little 'tweaking' to try and hide their origin doesn't do the trick. Is this just a 5 CD set of bootlegs? This bothers me for the original engineers who found the recordings and did all the work, just to have it lifted and reissued at a cheaper price by another company."
2,Only 11 minutes,"I realized I made the mistake of renting this video for $2.99 after I noticed it is only eleven minutes long! There is not enough information in eleven minutes to justify spending $2.99. Worse yet, although it is advertised as being eleven minutes long, the actual time is 10:08 minus the introduction."
1,Does Not Work With Most USB Devices,"This will physically connect to most devices needing a standard USB port.However, it does not provide enough power to actually do anything after it is physically connected.As other reviews pointed out, anything that needs more than about 500mA of current will not get much more than a trickle charge from this tip. e.g.- iPad, Sprint Overdrive 3G/4G network device, etc. do not really charge even though the physically plug in alright. It took about 24 hours to go from about 70% to 100% charge on the iPad, and that is with the iPad completely off.iGo does not seem to make a universal USB iTip. This is probably for marketing purposes, since then you would not ever need any additional iTips; you could then just plug any device into the same iTip using the USB cable that came with the device. Bad for sales, but good for the consumer..."
1,Could have been great,Doesn't work. It does not provide enough power for an IPhone. Iphone adapter does not fit through case so we tried the USB. No support from vendor. Returning to Amazon.
1,bitter bitter flavor.,"hmmm. maybe i received a bad batch? i made a stew with this product, and it turned the entire pot extremely bitter. so much so, that i had to actually throw it all away! i even had my mother taste it, in case it was just me. She was disgusted. it had a really strange medicinal taste, that i don't understand for a food product. i've used lipton soup mixes before, so this surprised me greatly. i opened a 2nd box, just to check, and the powder itself is extremely bitter.i can't return the 12 count box, unfortunately....bizarre experience, and i'm very dissapointed and even somewhat nervous that i ate something chemically poisonous, in the golden onion recipes product."
1,Lipton Soup not what I ordered,"I ordered the Golden Onion Soup Mix that I cannot find in the store. Instead I got a package of 12 Lipton Onion Soup Mix. Total waste of my time and money.Lipton Recipe Secrets, Golden Onion Recipe, 2-Count 2.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)"
5,Good product,So glad to have this product to make my roast recipe. I have not been able to find this in the stores for over a year. Have been using regular onion soup mix which is okay but the gravy it makes in my roast recipe was always dark.I like the lighter color this creates and it has a less harsh onion flavor than the regular kind.
2,Wasn't what I was looking for,Too general and elementary. First half of the book had nothing to do with welding. General high school shop stuff.
5,We Love D.W. !,"Our family really enjoys the Arthur and D.W. stories, and my two-year-old, in particular, can't seem to get enough of this book."
2,fast pitch tent,"I love to camp but hate the set-up and I thought this tent would be perfect. It was the first two times I used it, through wind and rain. The third time it leaked like crazy and the next time I took it out of the bag, one of the upper supports was broken. The company I bought it from no longer stocks it so, unless I can find replacement parts, I have the perfect tent that I can't use. Easy up and down but I never could get it all the way back into the bag it came in."
1,Very Disappointed,"My son bought this tent with his money, and the first time we set it up to see how it worked the outer pull broke. But he still used it the first time to camp. After that first time of camping he now has Three holes in the bottom of the tent and two holes in the side. Very thin material, considering we camp all the time and have had our other tent for 15 years and it has no holes. Now he has a new tent that is duct taped in several places with a broken arm, that probably won't last another two caming trips and is out the money he worked for and saved."
5,Great Sound Improvement,"This product made my Ipod a real music center when conected to my Nakamichi Amp.I used to conect the Ipod to the amp through the earphone connection and I hated the sound, but once I started conecting the Ipod with the Nyko Stereo Link, everything changes.It is a great sound improvement.A must!"
1,Not for iPad?,"Possibly it's not suppose to work with an iPad, but I confirm it does not. Nothing in the info to directly address iPad compatibility."
4,iPod to Home stereo,A must have if you want to listen to your iPod on your home stereo system. After spending months walking around the house with headphones I purchased this and plug my iPod into my stereo and get to listen to all my podcasts and iTunes anywhere in the house as well as in the car and away from home.
1,Didn't work,Didn't work with my 5th gen. ipod Nano. Got another cable that attached where the headphones attach and that works great.
4,4.5 stars really,This was the first Harlequin Next book I ever read and it got me hooked on the series (4 new books each month). This was an interesting story that was a quick read and kept me interested until the last page - you just didn't know how ti would end. I would recommend this for a nice quiet time in your life!
2,Marketing hype,"We got one of each for Christmas, and the toy does not match the hype. They are EXTREMELY slow. The tools on the front keep falling off."
2,A big disappointment,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. My 8 year old son has a no-name microsizer type vehicle and loves racing it around. So I thought my daughter and he might like to race them and play them together, since she has fun with his. I was very disappointed that this one is SOOOO slow and the range of the remote is less than half that of the no-name brand car we already had.The thing my daughter did like about it was the front lift can move up and down by radio control. Well, she had to find SOMETHING to make hers seem better than his! A big disappointment and cheaply made. Look elsewhere for a more fun tiny r/c car."
4,First Christian Romance I've read..,And I gotta admit it.. I loved it.I like how in the beginning there is this sort of .. mystery thing going on and romanced mixed in. The ending made me cry (not because it was a sad ending!) but rather touching..I had to say some of the female characters are ... ditzy. Like how they didn't think things through before they were quick to judge. I would of felt MIGHTY retarded if I was them.This book is free and it took a few nights to read. Its well worth it. Its a NICE refreshing CHRISTIAN romance and I think a lot of people can relate to some of the issues in this book.
4,"""A Truly Touching Love Story""","I just finished this book, and I have to say it is one of the best love stories I've read in some time. I love reading Christian romance stories, so when I found this new series by Susan May Warren, I was thrilled. The book is about Mona, a woman who has a dream of opening a bookstore/coffeeshop in an old Victorian house that is in need of many repairs. Enter Joe, a rugged, handsome, and charming handyman who can make Mona's dream a reality. The trouble is, Joe has secrets, secrets he has worked hard to keep Mona from finding out. Mona has a few secrets of her own, and as the story goes along both Mona and Joe struggle with those secrets, and the distance it puts between them. You'll cry with Joe as he learns about forgiveness, you'll cry with Mona has she's put through one trial after another, and finally, you'll laugh and rejoice with both as they finally find themselves in each other's arms!"
3,Great story - Christian Romance,"This was a very nice story... but it is Christian fiction. I consider myself Christian, but if anyone talked this way about God I would probably run in the opposite direction. I found myself skimming over the ""God talk."" But, it was free..."
4,really good!,The book defently picks up at the end and will leave you with a smile on your face because its truly a good ending!
3,Not my cup of tea....,"Story was ok but the ups and downs of emotions was too dramatic and almost every character quoting scripture, whoops the dog Rip didn't. I know really wonderful people in my life and not one of themquotes scripture. Guess it's the same reason most musicals make me cringe."
4,Happily Ever After Kindle freebee,"This is a wonderful story about forgiveness, love and redemption. It was well written and an extremely enjoyable read."
1,Get ready for church,Way to many bible quotes and wishy washy main characters. She loves him she hates him she trusts him she doesn't all based on who shes talking to at the moment. He's a professional highly successful person with the confidence on a gnat and the presence of a pup that needs to be hand fed to get it to eat. I felt like I was sitting in the longest church service I'd been to with the pastor repeating his speach over and over.
2,Not great,"Hard to get into the characters, too long to get to the point, and the plot is overworked. It took me a while to get through it."
2,The romance part of this was severly lacking,"I am still struggling to find a Christian romance novel that has true romance. One minute she loves him then she hates, she wants him near then she wants him gone, she trusts him then she doesn't. Love is a beautiful thing and a God given gift that should be celebrated more than just being the back ground story to everything else. So if you are looking for a true romance story, this isn't it."
1,not into Hyper-Christian romance.,"Yawn. If one doesn't care for super-evangelism, this is NOT the book to read. Couldn't get past the quote from Ephesians before I deleted it from my kindle. Mona turns into an indecisive ninny rather quickly, too."
2,So so read,"I picked up this book for its high rating and free status not knowing that it contained a religious bent. I am not deeply religious but also am not at all opposed to reading books with a religious persuasion. However, this book focused on god to the point of annoyance. Even though I find the story somewhat interesting, about a third of the way through, the slow pace and constant mention of god was almost too much of a turnoff to continue. I will probably finish the book but not anytime soon.I absolutely commend the author for releasing the first book in this series for free and allowing readers the choice about whether to purchase the rest of the series or not. If you're looking for a romance specifically with a religious bent, this book may be for you. However, unless you're prepared for a book centered on faith, my recommendation is pass."
1,ummmm.. NO!,"I am so glad this was free. I thought it would be good to try a new author. Sorry, not Susan May Warren. I did finish the book---which was a challenge. The story was just a story, nothing spectacular... but I did WANT to finish it. I couldn't handle all the religious connotation throughout the book. Bible quote after bible quote. Who wants to read a love story and be reminded about God at the same time? I'll stick with an author that wants to write a true love story, not one that feels the need to share all of her religious values and beliefs with me. Maybe if she dumped the religion piece she might not need to offer the book for free to get new readers...."
4,Great book for a rainy saturday!,"I downloaded this title to test how I would like reading books on my computer. Honestly, I was not expecting much, and thankfully, I was wrong!The book is well written, has good character development and draws the reader in. There are some things that were not 100% perfect, but what book is?It is a christian novel and as such speaks of god often. I think this is a wonderful story that would be a great companion for anyones rainy saturday.Annmarie RaiteAuthor of GRACES' HOPE, available on smashwords now, and soon kindle."
1,Started out good but...,"The author hooked me with the story line and drew me in, but somewhere along the line the story turned preachy and way to over the top. It's like she tried to draw a lesson from everything instead of focusing on the main story line. When she started quoting long passages of scripture page after page after page, I just lost interest in the story. In the future if you want to hold my interest, give me the story and show me through the character's actions about their chosen path and how God helps them to arrive at their answers. Don't beat me over the head with it. The old adage, show don't tell works here."
3,Just ok,"If you need some escapist, but clean fiction, go ahead and download this book for free. There are cliches, there are convenient coincidences, there are long-drawn out misunderstandings, but the book is more well-written than many in this genre. The story has been done many times before, two wounded individuals in need of healing find it in their relationship with God and each other. I felt that there was enough of a story between the characters without adding in the drama of a dangerous threat from an unknown source which gets a little sensationalist in the end."
4,A great story,"Susan May Warren Is one of my favorite authors. I've read most of her books and have loved every single one. When I picked up this book I was expecting to dive into it and not come up for a breath until I finished. I was right, Happily Ever After the first in the Deep Haven Series was everything i expected and more. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
5,"An uplifting story about hope, love & forgiving...",The book was a very good read... it was hard to put down. The characters were real and it was very easy to be caught up in Mona's hopes and even understand Joe's fears. Highly recommended.
5,Amazing!,"Love this book! I got it for my kindle since it was a free book and ended up liking it so well i bought the next 2 in the series, but I will say this is the best of the 3 by far!"
2,Predictable and rather far-fetched,"I actually think this novel would have made more sense had the characters *not* met in the silly parking lot scene. From the way about half the book was written it was though the author was trying to make it feel very suspenseful (references to ""his secret"" and having to leave soon) but that was just ridiculous as we already knew who he was. The ""bad guy"" was also overly done (rather than hints about his identity, there were pretty much neon arrows pointing to him so no surprise when he was revealed). And while both characters professed to be Christians, it didn't seem to be a genuine part of their lives, and the verses thrown randomly into the dialogue felt very artificial."
1,Stupid!!!!,I hated this book! I couldn't even finish it! Why? It was too much like kidnapping to me.Why did the author think that it was romantic to keep her standed in that town? If there was a legitimate reason but the man(can't remember his name) NOT to fix her car then that would have been somewhat better. But the story plot gave me the creeeeeeeeeps!!!!!This book was really bad!
1,Depressing story. Big disappointment.,"Maybe if this wasn't by LH I would've given it 3 stars. However, I have come to expect a certain standard of LH's writings & this one's way off the mark. Her trademark fast-paced action, intense love scenes & witty repartee are definitely missing--so much so that I wondered if LH even wrote this! Perhaps because of all the forewarnings, I found the much-dreaded ""All That Glitters"" & ""Independent Wife"" better than this one. Unfortunately, I had no such warnings about this book, so I really ended up very disappointed with it. (Hate's too strong an emotion to feel for this story bec. I found it quite unmemorable.)--Shockingly something I've never before felt/done with a 'Howard'."
4,Another great book by Linda Howard,"One of Linda Howard's earlier book...what more is there to be said...great and emotional read. I loved it!Thje hero is disabled at beginning of the book and while I thought I wouldn't like this, I really enjoyed it."
4,A positive review,"I read this book and thought it was her best romance novel that I've read. She hints at things without fully telling you until the middle of the story, and I personally thought she did a great job of making the characters realistic. I cried with Dione numerous times, and think it's excellent! Not as good as Mr. Perfect, but no book can compare to Mr. Perfect. Hope this helps you. It really is good, but there are no edge-of-your-seat, jump-at-every-noise, leave-a-nightlight-on thrills or chills, but it's a very enjoyable, soul-satisifying book."
4,You Can't Give Up,"Linda Howard is an excellent romantic novelist and this book is just another indication of that fact. This time, however, she does not include her usual suspenseful subplot but this really doesn't matter because the reader can still enjoy a good story.Diane, the well-known physical therapist, is hired to help Blake, a handsome entrepreneur, restore movement to his body which was crippled as the result of injuries from a major accident. He had been very uncooperative with previous therapists and essentially has ""given up"" on life. Diane, who has self-esteem and male trust issues because of a bad marriage and lousy parenting, has given up on love. This book is a tale about how they helped each other reclaim their lives.Howard seems to thrive on pairing insecure women with powerful, good-looking men. It always results in a winning combination and a book worth reading."
2,Misrepresentation,"I'm sad to say that this book failed to meet my expectations. Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors, and I was disappointed to find that this Kindle book, although released in fall 2012, was actually written in the '80's, and it's quite obvious. The quality of writing, plot, etc., is just not there."
1,Bad,"First, I don't like the dishonesty of an early book made to look like something published more recently.The characters are horrible. Dione is a weak, bitter person who focuses on things that happened more than 12 years ago. Blake is self-centered and manipulative. Honestly, I didn't care if they got together. I liked Blake's sister and her husband better, but I wouldn't want to read a book about them either.Usually I have a hard time putting a Linda Howard book down, but I just wanted to finish this and get it over with. It was repetitive beyond belief and needed some serious editing along with the character development.I was really disappointed with this book, and hope that no one else makes the same mistake I did by buying it."
3,Reprint of an early Linda Howard,"It's not bad. It's early Linda Howard, but if you haven't read it, that's better than no Linda Howard. Similar basic idea as Sandra Brown's book ""Adam's Fall."" At least it's in paperback, so you're not paying hardcover prices to read it, if you decide to buy."
3,Way to predictable,"One of the early stories by Linda Howard. This is the story of Dione who is a physical therapist with a past she wants to forget, and Blake who is giving up on life due to an accident where he looses the use of his legs, for a time. It isn't a bad story but it was a very fast read for me and a little to predictable."
5,"A wonderful story, one not to miss!","I've just finished reading ""Come Lie with Me"" which I finished in one day because I couldn't but it down. It is a wonderful story, with hope, dreams, and wishes coming true and lets not forget, True Love.This story ""Come Lie with Me"" is a story not to be missed. It is unique and heart warming. It will make you wish everyone had a love like Blake and Dione."
5,helped me,This belt really helped my pelvic pain during pregnancy. Very easy to use. I ordered a small and it was pretty snug so check measurements closely.
4,comfortable and what i expected,i have this belt before but the material disintegrated after 3 years. it is reliable but not that durable. breathable but not that comfortable to be worn under the clothes for too long.
3,sore back,It feels good when you put it on but the velcro belts can pop off if you move to fast . The ones that hooked like belts were the best but I can't seem to find them. I find myself using my old one and this one ends up on the floor a lot. But for this style it is well made.
1,Glaring Errors,"This guide is useful in some respects BUT...the math problems are much too easy, and there are gross errors that display editorial laziness. Get it if you like, but there is probably something better out there."
2,Good at explaining some concept but full of errors!,"While the book was good explaining many concepts and refreshing me, I had a hard time since it was full of typos. I have been out of college for a while and bought this book just to refresh myself on mathematical concepts. I've always had a very strong grasp on mathematics and just needed to glance over some concepts. I found the book good at explaining many concepts, but the reason I felt compelled to write a review is because there are numerous critical errors in the book. For example, in laying out a basic rule for students to memorize, the book mistakenly writes that an Odd X Odd = Even. There are also several instances where the answer provided does not match the answer's explanation. But an even bigger mistake in the book is where the author provides an incorrect answer and explains why it is correct. It was the wrong answer! I would definitely recommend that you use another source in addition to this book."
1,JUNK Full of Typos,"Just spent 30 min struggling with a math problem. Determined to figure out why my answer did not match PR's Turns out it's a typo! The answer is 42 and there is no choice that reads 42. The answer key reads ""Select D, the answer is 42"" When you look at D it reads 45. THis is the 4th time I've been screwed by a typo in this book.WHAT BUNK!Save your money."
1,Dark Passions Book 1,"My mom always told me if I couldn't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. So I won't."
3,"Much brain, little heart","Susan Sontag's first novel (published in 1963) is a fairly turgid, over-intellectualized tale, mostly notable for a stiff prose style that suggests the author had never read a book written after 1900. Sontag is, of course, primarily an essayist, and the book is at its best whenever she's just musing on various subjects. ""If war did not satisfy an elementary desire--not the desire to destroy, which is superficial, but the desire to be in a state of strain, to feel more intensely--the practice of war would have been tried once and abandoned."" But this is ""thought provoking"" in the worst sense--more of a lecture than a fully realized novel. The book is full of aphorisms, but the characters and events tend to be unconvincing (such as the narrator's unlikely detour into movie acting). It is finally undramatic and lifeless; monotony sets in well before the end. It comes off like a second-rate version of Andre Gide's ""The Immoralist."""
5,Unplugged at it's best !,This one grows and grows. Phillips is a rare artist of the possible improbible . His fingers are gold making symphonies of dreams on 12-string and piano. Get it now ! and you will play it till you're old and grey . He is the master and will never fade as he touches that untouchable something inside.
3,"Good but not great, nor what I was expecting","Okay, first of all, disregard that review below about Hal's illegitimate child. Clearly the writer didn't get past the first couple pages. Why write a review for something you didn't bother to read?I enjoyed reading this as it answers the question about what is Hal Jordan's legacy, as viewed through the eyes of his old sidekick Tom ""Pieface"" Kalmaku. It skirts the issue of whether one's actions can be judged by mistakes or heroics. Tom is guided along a journey in which he visits many of the people and groups that Hal wronged. While on this journey, Tom and his companion are hounded by a mysterious entity that seeks to destroy them. So overall, I enjoyed reading this but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting. Brent Anderson's pencils deserve special mention, for at times they look like Neal Adams, and that's always a good thing."
2,Interesting idea that doesn't pay off!,"What about Tom? That's a question many people were asking after Hal Jordan went insane due to Parallax. Here we find out what former sidekick/best friend Tom Kalmaku has been up to and his feelings for Hal. Needless to say Tom's life has gone downhill and he blames Hal. Then wackiness ensues. It was weird, confusing, and often unremarkable. I like the idea here but it was a little too metaphysical. The art by Brent Anderson was decent but there was no change in style or art for the flashbacks it was hard to tell they were taking place at times. This basically is a solid idea without a payoff. Skip it."
3,Anderson's artwork is great,"Not a bad read, and the artwork of Brent Anderson is great. The story to me just seemed to far off of the Green Lantern that I knew. Yet some of it is still very real! The action and creative script from writer Joe Kelly is fairly enjoyable. I suppose at this point I have to accept the fact that these graphic novels are sort of side stories that help give the character new ground to cover. I enjoyed the family insight with this particular story. The artwork again is great; Brent is able to capture so many things here, whether it is human facial features or the gritty nighttime street scenes. The whole idea of Hal having a son was a nice touch. This is the first graphic novel I have read of the Green Lantern, and the product was delivered on time by Amazon and in mint condition."
4,Essential reading,"This tome is essential reading for anyone wishing to grasp some of the more difficult and technical provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It genuinely does what it promises in its title, through a careful discussion of the legal and scientific aspects of the continental shelf as well as the relationship between the two."
5,A Homer,"Dewey Johnson has hit a homer with his first novel, Summer of Champions. The author weaves a bittersweet story of a young boy's coming of age in the Southwest of the 50's. Joe Don's trials and joys are both poignant and hilarious. The characters are well developed and memorable. A wonderful read for those who remember the innocence of childhood in a time less complex."
2,Subtitle: Commonly Accepted English Pronounciations of Biblical Names,"Warning: If you want to learn how the names really sound in their original languages, this is not the book for you. If you're curious about whether Baal is pronounced Bah-all or Bah-al or if David is pronounced Dah-veed or Dah-weed, this is not the book for you. I made the mistake of thinking I could learn what the words really sounded like. I already know how the majority of English speaking Christians pronounce most of the names.If you are looking for a book that will help you pronounce Biblical names in the fashion that most English speaking pastors would, this is probably the book for you. I don't really know how good it is at this purpose, because I don't feel I need it. I wouldn't worry about my pronunciation matching up with others, as long as I followed English rules, if my goal wasn't to pronounce them like they sounded in Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek."
4,Software is OK...But??,"I downloaded this product from The Body Journal web site several weeks ago (before I saw it on Amazon) and was waiting for the key to unlock the demo status of the program. It never arrived and calls, emails, shouts from my back yard -:) got no response from this company. While the software is pretty good, depending on your needs, I am sure that this company has either folded or is in the process of some transformation since it does NOT respond to ANY customer requests.Still, I found it to be one of the few programs that will download meter readings from a glucose monitoring device to its database on the Mac (there are many for Windows). My advice, download the app from The Body Journal's web site, then if you find that it fits your needs buy it from Amazon, where you will get the card (they call it an emergency record(s) card) with the key to take it out of demo mode."
4,Good product -- company seems rubber side up,"I have been using this product now for several years and have been very happy with it. I was really happy to see it will work with MAC Leopard OS.The program does just about everything I need it to do.The sad news is that it seems from all the data on the internet the company have gone rubber side up. When a new version came out a couple of years ago the company owner sent me a special pre-release DVD of the updated program. Support then was very good. Now, I have found no way to contact the company.I think it is well worth the price for what it does but one must keep in mind that if you run into any problems you are on your own. As far as the MAC platform goes I have never had any problems with running the program in Tiger or Leopard.Hope this is of help."
1,Awful,"I tried this software out and was completely unsatisfied. Afer working with it for more than an hour, I gave up. Even though I am fairly savvy with computers and software, I was not able to enter any data or do any of the other things it said it could do. I tried again a few days later with the same results. I have erased it from my hard drive and if I had the time I would complain to the manufacturer or Amazon."
4,good sunglasses,"Nice sunglasses. Pretty fast shipping. Took a week. Sunglasses are kind of bent- One lens is closer to one eye than the other lens is to the other eye. None of my other sunglasses fit this way, so I know it's not the shape of my skull."
2,Ok,"Great idea but it takes some getting use to. Also, I find the quality is not consistent. The battery seems to be used up quickly and the inside metal pieces make it hard to replace the battery. I still use mine but and will purchase another one only because there is not another option to the clicker with multiple sounds. This product needs to be improved on and it is pricey too."
2,Clicker training two dogs,Neat shape and great sound but not that good to train two dogs with. There is no way of knowing what clicker sound setting you are on. This causes a lot of confusion as you don't know which dogs allocated sound will ring when you click.
4,Packaging Terrible,"If you order this, plan on sending it back for replacement. Amazon ships this in a larger box with air packs. The brads are packaged in a weak cardboard box that falls apart when bouncing around during shipment. I ended up with about half of the brads broken into small pieces, the other half fell out of the bottom of the outer box. The replacement, shipped the same way, barely survived with minimal damage, not worth sending back for a second time. If amazon would tape the brad box before shipping they would survive.On a positive note, the brads are good and work fine with my Porter-Cable gun."
4,Gripping tale of suspense.,"NIGHTMARE RUN by Christine Janssen is an exciting tale of amnesia, love, disturbing dreams and secrets from the past. Her characters stay with you long after you finish the last page. Not your average murder mystery, and not for the faint-hearted! I look forward to more books from this promising writer."
3,Very good but too elitist,"Definitely covers all the good places but only has token ""vintage"" and ""discount"" entries and entirely ignores the 34th street shopping district in the garment district where there is a ton of stuff to be found. Focuses way too much attention on Soho. To be a fashionista in NYC though, you definitely need this book. One thing it needs to have is maps-by-neighborhood with the stores marked/numbered. Otherwise its hard to spend a day shopping, working from the book. You have to make your own map. But it is the only book of its type that I've seen so its a must have."
5,Engaging and Well Writ,"This is one of the six autobiographical works by Maya Angelou.Here, Maya Angelou returns to the U.S. after living in Ghana working with Malcolm X.When she gets back to her home, she finds out Malcolm X has been assassinated. This saddens and upsets her but confuses her too, since a black man has killed him. Eventually, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. asks Maya to go around to black churches to try to gain support for the Poor People's March. But he too gets assassinated.This work is full of depth and words that will help you delve into yourself and your feelings.If you like this book, you may like to readI Know Why the Caged Bird Singswhich follows this."
1,"Good thing it's 40% off, not much content","I would never think of Maya Angelou as lazy, but this book seems like it was scribbled over a weekend. The book itself is small, the type is big, the margins are very wide. If it were printed like a normal hardcover, it would be about 85 pages long. How disappointing that the author of five remarkable and beautiful volumes of autobiography has done such a lightweight, impressionistic job on number 6. I wanted to know so much more. Here's hoping she sits down and really works hard on number 7."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"I KNOW MAYA TO BE A VERY BRIGHT WOMAN, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY NOT ENOUGH POETRY AND TOO MUCH DETAIL IN THIS WORK. LISTENING TO THE BOOK ON TAPE WAS INTERESTING AT TIMES, BUT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE WADING THROUGH TOO MUCH MEDIOCRE STUFF TO GET TO THE GOOD STUFF. SHE ALSO REFERS TO ""DRINKING"" TOO MUCH THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. I HOPE HER OTHER STUFF IS BETTER."
2,Rock Bottom indeed,"Cab is great, but not here. Minnie is eviscerated, the rest are rather sluggish.And Spivak, well I knew the name but had never heard him before. And won't again. This is generic MOR dance music that would be perfectly at home as blah-blah background in some mediocre 40s movie. The guys can play, but the whole sound is just kinda sleepy and dull. No fire, no zip, and a bland vocalist combine for instantly forgettable material.Save your dough, however little they want, for something with the flash that made this an era of memorable tunes. This is 32 minutes of decidedly second-rate stuff."
1,Poor service,"DVD was damaged--picture was distorted and irregulaf. The customer service arm of the supplier did not provide much, if any, help in correcting the problem. I finally gave up in disgust--never again will I order from this source."
4,Wicked cool,"Dack Shannon, violent, creepy, and rash, I love him! He does what the law can't. He kills the bad guys. The stories are damn good and well thought out. It is great escapism. I want to read more!"
4,"Grim, great, ghostly!","Dack Shannon, grim albino warrior from Majestic agency, dammit, he is cool. I found this book a great read and will recommend all my buds get it. Shrewsbury writes in a thudding way, striking at the heart and brain at times. Super cool pulp fiction. This ain't high art, but it never pretends to be.""Bliss"" is a neat story where Dack takes down some goths. ""Destroyer"" about a weird Congressman blackmailed by Dack is great, too. My favorite story is ""Patterns of Oblivion"" because of the mystery elements. I hope to see more of Dack in the future."
5,Dack and Shrews a Classic Duo,"I have been a reader of Steven Shrewsberry's work for a little over a year now. His work is crisp, clean and very well drawn out. In fact, I believe him to be one of the better up-and-coming author's of his/our generation. Dack Shannon is unique, driven showcase of stories that will certainly please any true coinsurer of rare, bold literature. open the cover for yourself ... don't think you will be disappointed."
1,Dack Shannon . . . pleeeeeease!,"What did I just spend my hard-earned money on? Does anyone whose read this literary defecation even know? An albino secret agent working for Majestic Services? What complete, ultra-total garbage! The writing style lacks any sense of ""style"" and is beset by inflated, la-di-da prose throughout. I just hope this author doesn't take his/herself too seriously, 'cause the average reader's not likely to. The stories in Nocturnal Vacations left me feeling angry -- angry that I wasted the time sifting through them, hoping to find originality, but finding it to be as pale as the main character's skin. I don't expect to see Dack Shannon (Ha) running across the silver screen anytime before the universe folds back into itself."
5,A Great Book: #1 on my List,"I just had to say Ms. Byrd is that you really out done yourself. I was cracking up while reading the book. My laughter was so distracting to where my sister couldn't do her work but when I showed her what I was laughing at, she was laughing louder than I was. She's entertained easily! But what I couldn't get over was Matt cutting Chante's car in half. I couldn't believe it, but I ""saw"" him sawing away! ""When Valentines Collide"" shows that you can repair your marriage even if your at each others throat. That may not work for everybody but you have to be able to identify where your marriage went wrong and apologize. That's exactly what I learned from this wonderful, laugh out loud tell. I can't wait until ""Feel the Fire"" comes out. I'll be waiting!"
5,Congratulations Mr Patterson !!!,A helluva book!!! I got deep in touch with the caracters and I just could not to put it down The most interesting book among the last 50 I have been reading
4,Enjoyable read,"I can see that this author could become a favorite, depending on whether the errors of this book are common with him.Beautifully written with great characterization, the first error of this book was a who-dunnit so obvious it couldn't possibly be true. Alas, it was. Laden with romance and a more realistic view of true love that just wasn't enough than I have seen in a long time. I found this well-done presenation very appealing. Treating a certain intimate act as enough of an anomaly to be a clue, however, had me wondering when the book was written. Ah, yes, even now enough of a no-no to effectively capture the readers' interest, it is perhaps easy to forget that what so many men fantasize about is likely what any rapist might do. Not trite, but ... more effective as an attention-getter than as a realistic clue."
3,Good but slow at times,"My first RN Patterson novel. I found it to be slow pace, quite unlike other court room/detecive novel. The authors develops the characters in details, set the scene in great details. As you aread it, you are transport back to small town USA, and experience the decay of a mill town.I like his story telling that I went on to read his other Nove, Dark Lady centered around the procedutor Stella."
5,ENTHRALLING,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ, IT HAS BEEN ALMOST 2 YRS SINCE I READ IT AND I STILL PICK IT UP AND READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. I WAS SO OBSESSED WITH THIS BOOK THAT I SCARED MYSELF. RNP HAS A RESPECT FOR FEMALE CHARACTERS THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN IN A LOT OF OTHER BOOKS BY OTHER AUTHORS. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ, CURL UP WITH IT AND YOU WILL READ IT COVER TO COVER OVER AND OVER!"
2,Silent Witness a real snoozer,"I'm a Richard North Patterson fan so I could hardly wait to get my hands on his latest legal thriller. Having read the book, I must admit that it is a real bore. Filled with stock and uninteresting characters, the pace is extraordinarily slow and the story, predictable. Midway through the book I was certain I knew ""who did it"", and I was right. The sad thing was, I just didn't CARE who did it. I just wanted the book to end. I stayed up until 1:30am to finish this book just wishing that SOMETHING interesting would happen. Would that I could reclaim those hours of sleep...Give me ""Eyes of a Child"" anytime over this one!"
4,Well written story,"This is the third book I've read by Patterson. The other two were: ""Degree of Guilt"" and ""The Final Judgment"". The characters were well developed and it had a great deal of suspense. At times it was slower than I'd like, but I never lost interest."
4,A page-turner that you know will have a twist...,I never suspected that outcome ... I had my eye on another character.
4,Wonderful read,To me this has been a wonderful read full of suspense and graphic court procedures which made the book hard to put down once I started it. Richard North Patterson has certainly produced a great story.
4,I was entertained,"The mystery was kept alive the entire time - wondering who was truthful. Even though you kinda know how the story is going to go, it was still entertaining to see how things turn out in the end. I liked it. But not as much as ""Protect and Defend""."
4,"Gripping, Fascinating legal arguments",A good whodunnit for holiday reading. Not the best of this author's books that I hacve read. Lacks the depth of research apparent in such books as In the name of honour.
2,Very slow. Not as good as some reviews would make us believe,"This is my first RNP book, and I can't say that I liked it much. The pace is too slow and the story drags on for about halfway through the book. There are some repetitions of some points and stuff. The other half was almost okay, and the ending isn't all that bad, but if you like fast paced stories and some good detective stuff and all that, this one's not for you. You could find better ways to spend your money. On the other hand, if you want to think deeply about human relations and friendship all that soul stuff, maybe you'd want to read this. There's some stuff in this that I find somewhat disturbing. This one's not about crime and detection (although that is a part of it), but about the lives of two men."
1,Hmm.........,"Silent Witness is blurbed as a legal thriller. So far it reads like a boring romance novel, yuck. I'm hoping it gets better, but after reading nearly two hundred pages, I have me doubts."
5,DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I BOUGHT? I DON'T THINK SO!,"Do you even look at what I bought? I bought 3 books on tape. It will take me months to listen to them while I'm driving! How can I review them? They got here when they were supposed to. Have I listened to them - NO, NOT YET. Give me a month or two for me to listen ... PLEASE."
5,What a book! I read it in one day,Richard North Patterson has done it again! He has written abook that delves deeply into the psyches of its maincharacters and then throws a terrific twist in to boot. Icouldn't stop reading just to find out what was going tohappen next. The courtroom scenes are as riveting as theflashbacks told in the story. I feel it is probably thebest book he has written to date.
5,Long time since I read late and early A.M.,This is the first of Patterson's books I've read. It was a real joy - with his style of twists and character descriptions. I will now read one of his earlier books
1,What A Waste Of Time,I read thruogh the lengthly 500 pages and was disappointed by the anticlimatic ending. Come on now. Can we get more original here
3,Predictable,"Knew ""who did it"" within first chapter. Ending was predictable. Great characters but no suspense."
4,good story...,"that would have been more interesting for me had i read it (instead, head the a 4-tape cassette version that seemed abridged) . . . nevertheless, there were lots of twists and turns, and the story kept me guessing until the end."
4,Excellent Book,"I picked this book up because it is set in my home town -- Bay Village, OH. The real Bay Village is less rural and more friendly than the town depicted in this book, but the tone of the inhabitants seems about right.The story line made this book well worth reading -- the unexpected plot twists were great and the characters were very well-developed.I really enjoyed this book and I have loaned it to two or three of my friends. Even though they don't have the same point of reference as a native, they enjoyed the book, too."
4,"Very Riveting Court Thriller, Though Predictible","After you work your way through the mundane lives of teenagers in a Lake Erie, Ohio town in the first section of the book, you are then ready for one helluva good courtroom drama that doesn't let up. One teen finds his loved one dead in a park and bravely and, with the help of a good lawyer, avoids being charged. He goes to San Francisco and becomes a star lawyer. Then, decades later he returns to Ohio to defend his childhood buddy, charged in a similar murder. I believe Patterson is the best courtroom drama writer today and in this book he tells a suspenseful, engrossing story replete with lots of courtroom action. The ending, though somewhat predictibile, is a good one and leaves the reader satisfied. For me, this is one of the best Patterson books I've read, so far."
5,My First RNP Book,"I first listened to this book (unabridged) while driving back from school for xmas vacation. I sat in my car till I finished listening to it. This is a spectacular, griping, suspensful and wonderfully written book about friends, lovers, enemies, lust, greed, and justice, all wrapped in up in a masterful murder trial book. I finally picked the book up and re-read the novel, pikcing up on things I missed when I read it. I loved it the first time, I praised it the second time. I have given this to many of my friends as gifts and highly recommend this book to all book lovers out there."
5,One of my all-time favorite legal thrillers!,"I recently discovered Richard North Patterson, and have been devouring his books. Each one has been excellent. Silent Witness is the best I've read. The story line is totally captivating, packed with surprises, and the ending couldn't have been done any better. On top of all this, the characterization was so deep and real that I had a hard time remembering it was fiction. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read. I'd enjoy hearing from other readers who felt the same, and would appreciate some recommendations from them."
4,Cant Put it Down,"How many times you wished you could go back in time? Well Tony, the lawyer in this books, get a chance of a lifetime and you wont be able to put the book down until the end.Although the end is less interesting the the whole book, this surely was a good 500 pages!"
5,Goodbye Grisham-North Patterson is growing better and better,"I have read just about all of Richard North Patterson's novels (they are my best friend on the Boston commuter rail), but this one is, above and beyond, the best. Patterson intrigued me with his deeper probe into Private Screening's attorney Tony Lord; and the ending? Well, let's just say it invoked a psychological tailspin to revel the ""mother"" of all legal thrillers, Presumed Innocent. Good going, Patterson! You've officially replaced John Grisham on my shelves for good!"
2,Dragged on and on,Same story could have been told in half the number of pages and would have been much more interesting.
2,Predictable,Silent Witness was a good book. To say anything more would be to overstate the writing. The story was rather simple and I felt that the plot was rather obvious. While I enjoyed the story it was rather easy to see the twists and turns coming. The only way I would recommend this book would be if you have nothing else to read.
4,"A good read, but not a perfect one","I actually grew up in the real life Lake City which is known as Bay Village. Yup, the two churches there really exist and there is a park along Lake Erie. The attitudes of the inhabitants of Lake City generally resemble those of the people of Bay, only more extreme. The Slavic angle in the book was also surprisingly true to life. The court room scenes were gripping. One complaint is that the book got really creepy and icky when it come to the crime in question and what Sam did to the girl. I also liked the way the relationship between Sam and Tony was shown. There are many paths in life and we are the sum of those choices as shown what each made of what life have given them."
2,silent witness,"reading 500 pages of this book was a waste of time, just go to the last two chapters and get it over with."
2,Mr. Perfect is Mr. Boring,"I could only get through 150 pages of this insufferable main character. Since I only read a fraction of this 500-page book, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt by rating it 2 stars instead of 1.Tony Lord is absolutely perfect in every way. He's a hard-working working-class guy who is brilliant, a star athlete (in TWO sports), gorgeous, and dating the prettiest, richest girl in school, who has saved her virginity just for him. He has a rough patch (to say the least) but we already know that he ends up as a famous lawyer with a gorgeous movie-star wife. Oh, for Pete's sake!What's more, Patterson likens Tony's persecution to that suffered by Jews (via his lawyer [!]) and blacks (via his football teammate [!]). It was all too much. I had zero sympathy for what could have been a very sympathetic character."
5,Terrific. One of his best.,"This is one I couldn't put down. Like another of your reviewers I found myselfskipping description, but in my case it was impatience to find outwhat was going to happen. As usual, his description of courtroomantics and theatrics was riveting.This is just another of Patterson's books that I would be glad to recommend to anyone.<P<"
3,Mediocre.,"This book is a good read, not a great one. Patterson fans will like it. I have read and liked (better than this one) other Patterson books. I this one I found myself skipping whole paragraphs just to get on with the story and get it over with. This is not a sign of a gripping story. Great books (and great authors) are those that I devour one word at a time grudgingly because I want them to last as long as I can make them last because I don't want the story to end. Patterson can do that; he doesn't do it in this book."
4,Good,"While not as good as his other books, Silent Witness kept me guessing. While I knew who killed the girl in the present, it really started getting you guessing as to who killed Tony's high school sweetheart. The ending was suspensful enough. I enjoyed it, wasn't the best book I read but it sure wasn't the worst either"
3,"Good, but in wrong time frame","This book was good, but it definetely does not co-incide with Ashleigh's Diary and the TB series. I didn't feel Ashleigh changed or 'grew up' very much. It was good, but not the greatest."
1,Untrue to the original,I loved Ashleigh's Diary special and think it was possibly the best Thoroughbred book Joanna Campbell has ever wrote. It was beautiful and made me cry. This one pales in comparison and is completely untrue to the original diary. I much prefer Miz Campbell's writings to those of the new authors.
2,Whatever,"This is to the Rachel reviewer-Books don't win Oscars. They'd win Pultizer Prizes or another award for the written word.Anyway, about the book...I don't know if it's really worth the money. Of couse, that's the same way I've felt about the whole of the Ashleigh series. I just think there should have been more Thoroughbred books about Ashleigh.I think my biggest peeve about the Ashleigh series is that it was written in a time bubble, so everything that happened Ashleigh's Diary didn't happen.If you really like this series, then I see no reason why you shouldn't read it. If you're not a regular reader, I just wouldn't bother with the book."
4,Not perfect but not bad,"I am a stove collector as well as a car camper. I have many stoves and use them all on occasion. I almost always bring the 533 along because it just works well. It burns hot with Coleman fuel but I usually don't actually cook on it, I boil water on it. The simmer function is marginal until it heats up and can sustain low fuel flow and vaporize it effectively. As for those of you who chose to use unleaded fuel and clogged your generator tubes, please send them to me, I will pay the postage. As soon as I take them apart, soak them in carburator cleaner and flush them clean, I will sell them back to you. :-) For those of you who want to backpack, this stove is probably a bit heavy. Check out an MSR or an antique Svea 123 but be ready for sticker shock."
2,"Good Stove, Lousy Durability With Gasoline","If you buy this stove, please stick with Coleman fuel. If you use gasoline, plan on the generator tube clogging up in a VERY short time, leaving you with an expensive paperweight.Yes, it's dual fuel, as long as you don't really expect it to operate very long before dying."
3,no heat control,"Great little stove but coleman needs to put a better heat control valve on it, very hard to set it on simmer its either full flame or nothing."
5,awesome,This stove is exactly what I wanted and needed. The seller shipped very fast and the packaging was perfect. I only wish Coleman made a case for it like the ones for their lanterns.
1,No funciona bien,"Y para colmo de males en mi país Guatemala, no venden el Keroseno, por consiguiente es una mala inversión. Dice dual fuel, y no ha funcionado ni con alcohol de quemar, ni diesel !!!"
1,Ruster and coroded,New? Corroded and rusted. Poor condition. My 30 year old stove looked better! No one inspected. This should never have been sent out!
2,DISCONTINUED,I had to use gasoline in this in a pinch and the generator got plugged up. I just purchased this and they are discontinued and they no longer sell the generator for this model. BS if you ask me. Of course it is past the return period so I am stuck with a useless pos for $50. I could have just made a penny stove out of cans and had the same result only difference is the penny stove would still be working. Boo Coleman.
5,Very Reliable!,"I've owned this stove for at least 10 years and it has never let me down! I go on a lot of camping trips with folks who like to spend a lot more money on gear than I do and while they were getting their super lightweight stoves ready to light, my Coleman was already boiling water.If you're looking for a serious backpacking stove, this probably isn't it--it's a little heavy for that. The nice thing about it, though, is that it holds enough fuel in the tank to keep you from carrying a lot of extra fuel. Depending on the length of your trip, you may not need to bring extra fuel at all!Easy to light, boils water quickly to save fuel, sturdy & stable, easy to refuel. Excellent stove!"
3,Good for boiling but not for simmering,"I bought one to carry on a float trips so I will not be carrying it on my back. It will sure put up a fire but when I tried to simmer something on it the flame dies out. Seems like it is either all on or with no flame at all.I will keep it around the home for emergenies but don't see it being useful for cooking.Also, I keep reading from others about how using unleaded fuel ruins it. Is there some way to clean it out?"
3,Its a Coleman!,"Bought this for lightweight compact camping. It will do the job and because its a Coleman I expect many years of reliable service. This is not a backpacking stove. Too big and heavy. It lights easy, watch the flame up on start. Its not as easy to control the temp as I expected, especially if trying to simmer. I did relite it using less tank pressure than the instructions stated and was able to keep a lower flame. Good price for a no fuss camp stove."
5,"Top-notch and the only vid that teaches the ""paduka"" call","Top-notch and the only vid that teaches the ""paduka"" cal"
4,3rd Time's a Charm,"The Marshall Tucker Band's third album ""Where We All Belong"" is another strong effort from one of southern rock's better artists. Though a notch or so below Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers, MTB put out some excellent music, especially during their 1970s heyday. A little less rocking and more country oriented than Skynyrd or the Allmans, MTB was actually better at writing ballads. This album lacks only a first rate single, though the best tracks are ""In My Own Way,"" ""Where a Country Boy Belongs"" and ""Now She's Gone."" The second half is live, and features extended versions of earlier MTB standouts like ""24 Hours at a Time,"" (with Charlie Daniels on fiddle) and ""Take the Highway.""Overall, a fine but often overlooked southern rock album."
5,Another Great Marshall Tucker Album,"WHERE WE ALL BELONG is yet another great Marshall Tucker Band album. The studio portion features some great new songs, especially ""How Can I Slow Down"" and ""Now She's Gone"", while the live half includes MTB's answers to ""Free Bird"" or ""Green Grass And High Tides"", ""24 Hours At A Time"" and ""Take The Highway."" If you love the Allman Brothers Band, the Outlaws, or Lynyrd Skynyrd, you'll love this album."
4,Mostly solid,"I've never been a big fan of the half live/half studio album. This one by the Marshall Tucker Band is certainly imbued with fine playing and singing, but I find I keep comparing it to earlier albums like their first two. Solid but not essential."
4,Excellent Advice,This is a very good and practical book about relationships written by a very wise lady. I wish I would have read it years ago. I hope her next book is about her thoughts on money and how to attract it. A book on health wouldnt be a bad idea either.
1,sent incorrect parts,I entered the make and model of my classic car and all info indicated. The wire set arrived and they were not as pictured. The end boots were incorrect and would not fit the car. They did allow a return with refund but what a hassle.
4,Lee does it again!,"This book compiles about 23 issues of spidey's earlier adventures, going through many important chapters. It doesn't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes, perhaps because most Spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume. If you're new to spidey, snag this... if you're not new, still get it to fill in your blanks =)."
5,Continued Greatness,"Continuing the Spider-Man comics saga in volume 4, we find Peter Parker up against new foes as well as the classics. In this set, Gwen Stacey's father begins to have his suspicions that Parker and Spider-Man have a deep ""connecting"" secret.You'll find these titles inside volume 4:""Mission: Crush the Kingpin!""""Spider-Man: Wanted!""""The Speedster And The Spider!"" (featuring Quicksilver)""Rocked By.. The Shocker!""""The Web Closes"" (part 1 of the secret tablet saga)""If This Be Bedlam!"" (part 2 of the secret tablet saga)""Death Without Warning"" (part 3 of the secret tablet saga)""Lizard Lives!"" (part 1)""In The Blaze Of Battle!"" (part 2)""The Night of the Prowler!""""To Prowl No More!""""On The Trail Of... The Chameleon!""""The Coming of the Kangaroo!""""And Then Came Electro!""""The Schemer!"" (part 1)""The Kingpin Strikes Back!"" (part 2)""And Now... The Secret of the Schemer!"" (part 3)""Beware... the Black Widow""""Unmasked at Last!""""The Arms of Dr. Octopus!""""Doc Ock Lives!"" (part 1)"
3,Quality,"Three stars. All three are for the stories direction and acting. If I was focusing only on those I'd have given it 5 stars. However, I'm also rating quality of print and packaging for which I give no stars! The audio and video quality is poor, as is the DVD menu. It simply looks amateurish - like it had been recorded on VHS and given a cheap home menu. The thing that really gets my goat is the photo on the back of the DVD box! A picture of Jim and his beloved dad on the beach! Perfect! Except that the 'dad' here is Robert Donley who played Rocky only once, in the pilot. After six seasons playing Jim's dad how could they not have used a picture of Noah Beery, Jr!!!!?I think that just about sums up the careless, rushed job of putting together the final season of this beloved series."
1,Rockford Files Season 6,"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ... I really enjoyed the first couple of seasons but after that things went downhill. With this the last season is the worst. If you like dialog this is for you. It put me to sleep. The plots are thin and poorly written. Because of this The actors spend most of the time in each episode explaining what's going on. Jim Garner is in his 50's with a ""father"" who is in his 60's just doesn't fly. ""Rocky"" Garner's TV dad spends most of his time this season hanging around Rockfords trailer laying on the couch. It's painful to see Garner and veteran actress Lauren Bacall struggle thru the first episode. Thier charactors just don't gel as is the case with just about every episode. There's enough loose skin on thier necks to create another charactor.If you enjoy watching ""The Price is Right"" you'll love this collection."
5,TV time!,"LOVE this TV series!! The entire collection is GREAT. When you are working with a great actor like James Garner, you can't go wrong. The service was good and I wouldn't hesitate to reorder from this place again."
3,Season Six or Farewell Tour?,"As a Rockford fan I was disappointed in season six. Most of the episodes seemed to be written just to get in past actors (many of whom played bad guys Rockford had put away). Only a couple of episodes really surrounded a mystery plot. There was a lot of dialog that sounded like a 'good-bye tour' rather than the normal quick banter the first five seasons provided.If you are a serious Rockford fan, you will want this just to have. If you are interested in the action, sarcasm, and mystery of Rockford, you can skip this season."
2,A weak season,"The writing for Season 6 slipped dramatically. The best of the episodes were mediocre; the rest were awful. Watching these almost made me wonder if Garner really left the show early because of the poor writing rather than physical ailments, as he claimed. Thankfully, this wasn't really the end. Several of the TV movies measured up quality-wise and they are about to be released (half of them, anyway) in early November."
5,Series,My husband had all the first series and bought these to complete the set. Always a good show on Television.
5,Best X factor singer yet,So what is he is good looking. He is a talented singer and That's my goal is a positive and uplifting song. I can't wait until he releases a full album.
1,"Absoulutely rubbish, which you could find in your bin the day you buy it.","Let me tell you, Shayne Ward is just one of those pop singers who only go by looks, if he looked like shrek he would not be anywhere today, face it girls your only buying this because you fancy him.Look at Justin Timberlake, where is he today, they go and move on, and thats what Shayne will do except alot faster.This song is so rubbish, the thing I hate so much is that he didn't even write this!So its not his own material, and let me take you in on a little secret he does not care about this song, its not like these lyrics mean anything to him, as he did not write.And on ""No Promises"" thats even worse than this, yes he might of wrote it I don't know, but does the song have depth, or is it just a plain old expected pop song.By the way it's the second one.Shayne Ward has no protential, neather does anyone who comes of X Factor, its all just one big [...]"
2,Your Back to the Screen Required!,"I was disappointed with this Video compared to the others I have used. When trying to learn the ""Boot Scootin Boogie"" you have to turn your Back to the screen to try to get the perspective of the Instructor. Also the Video was shot in 1993 and maybe the technology didn't allow for proper lighting... it is very difficult to see with clarity the Dancers' feet except for the those who are wearing light colored boots. This Video would perhaps serve as a ""refresher"" for someone who had already learned the Dance and just wanted to refresh their memory. Even trying the rewind several times did not serve to clarify the initial step due to the Instructor's one dimensional example.Since a VHS tape allows for 120 minutes of instruction I would have liked this Video to have utilized more than 35 minutes to cram in 7 Dances."
2,opinion,not collector grade. the books had cellophane tape on the binding. perhaps that how you rate the grade on books that old?
4,Fun toy,My 3 year old son loves everything construction and tractors. He really likes this toy. The sound is a little loud but not too bad
5,Great Cd .....,The first time I hear the cd ... I thought... not bad .. but not too good but when you listen to the lyrics and the music better.. It was a great cd ... Not only on the cd the girls are great ... Live too.. Go.. on
3,disappointed overall,"I looked forward to getting this Cd after I heard the song ""Never Alone"" on WOW 2005 but the CD was underwhelming to say the least. Very bubblegum, most of the songs sound the same, and rather juvenile compositions except for the wonderful song previously mentioned, which even sounds as if another band was performing this song! What gives BarlowGirl? It's an ok first attempt, but I really wish they would have taken more time and produced more songs with the maturity and gorgeous sound of Never Alone. If interested in BarlowGirl I suggest picking up WOW 2005 for Never Alone and passing on the rest of the CD."
5,Great Music,"I love BarlowGirl! Some of my favorite songs were ""Superstar"" and ""Pedestal"". I hope I can get other great artist's CDs too.(...)"
2,LOL,"I'm sorry to say I heard this album and LAUGHED. The music is just so lame and they lyrics are so poor. How is someone supposed to take these girls seriously? And this may seem childish but what kind of name is ""Barlow Girl""? It sounds like the name for a country western musical tragedy. Buy it if you want a good laugh."
1,bad,I couldn't stand the songs they sound very unperfessional.Although I havn't listened 2 the whole CD is because I could't make myself do it
5,This is a GREAT CD!,"I take offense to one of the reviews for this CD where the reviewer states a one star rating because they say ""no dating"" and he/she didnt like the chord progression....I bought this CD because I heard a track on a freebe CD and I was impressed. I brought it home and from the first listen I was hooked. These sisters have a very unique sound and a very positive message. Also, a big part of the appeal for me is the lead singer's voice. She is just fantastic!This is a CD for all ages (although it is probably geared towards teenagers). I am a 39 year old guy and this has a permanent place in my CD changer! Every song on this CD is great and I highly recommend it. If you want fun, uplifting, positive, catchy, great vocals, good songwriting, and something you can just crank -- then this is the CD for you.Good job Barlow Girls -- thanks for the effort - you chicks ROCK!"
2,1 GREAT song--the rest not well written/produced,"I heard a LOT about this band but only ""Harder Than The First Time"" caught my ear the first time I heard it. It's produced EXACTLY like Kelly Clarkson's pop/rock hits but the rest of this Barlow Girl CD just didn't work for me. The lyrics and music didn't go well together and for the most part, the music simply isn't memorable -- no great hooks. And vocally, it would be nice if the girls put a little more passion behind their efforts.So, download ""Harder Than The First Time"" and save your money."
5,"Great album, mare than worth the $","THESE GIRLS ROCK. seriously, the music is great, lyrics are amazing, and the girls are outstanding live. Buy this album, u won't regret it."
4,Very good album,"Barlowgirl is something else. Out of all of the Christian pop bands/singers, only Barlowgirl appeals to me (pretty much). I first heard the song Never Alone about November last year (2004). When I heard it, I thought I was listenign to Evanenscence, and though I don't listen to Evanescence because of their negative attitude about being a Christian band, I do think Evanescence has some extraordinary music and vocals. Well I found out that it was Barlowgirl and I was like... I love that song, but do I want to buy the whole album. I was very hesitant because it's an all girl band, young teenagers were liking it and I just felt like an odd man out. Well I bought it, and I enjoyed it alot. Minus the song Clothes and Average Girl, everyother song appealed to me. I just enjoy the vocals so much. And this group is going the right direction. Keep on rocking."
5,Live or CD....both rock,I just watched the girls play live in concert here in Dallas. It was one of the most wonderful experiences I have ever had. I bought the CD at the concert and found even more songs that I loved on there. Specialy the last song which can be an awsome worship song. I love it.
5,Great CD!,This CD is really great when I bought it I had never really heard any of their music but my brother told me that I would probably like it so I bought it. At first the songs sounded very similar (like another person has said) but then if you actually listen to the songs they are all VERY different. I absolutely love this band and every single song has a very good meaning and lesson to be learned. I would definitely recommend this CD.
1,Not really better than nothing,Fortunately I read enough of this in the bookstore to hang onto my money and find something else. Lightweight and uninformative.
2,clunky intro to Applescript,"While I found information in the book somewhat helpful, the tutorials are incomplete and confusingly presented. I'm especially referring to ""hour 14,"" where the tutorial is missing key elements and isn't particularly adept at explaining what bits of code go where. There aren't many books about AppleScript Studio, but I would pass on this one and wait for Sal Sogoyans ""AppleScript 1-2-3."" Sal's public presentations are much clearer and I expect his book will reflect his excellent communication skills and mastery of Applescript."
4,"Finally, No more foil/plastic wrap ""lids""","I was in need of new bakeware and got this because it had the added bonus of lids, which work great. I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,good product for price,"glass a little thinner than our previous set but works just fine.Cover isn't rubber, it's a semit fexible plastic that snaps into place.Works good but we like our previous set better since it was manufactured w/thicker glass and had rubber covers"
1,Other than the tops to the,"once cup containers not fitting, I would have rated a couple of stars higher. However, parts not fitting do indicate a serious quality control problem.Enough of a problem for me to never buy Pyrex again"
1,NOT original recordings,"I found this album while looking for tracks by one of the included artists. At face value, this looks like it should be a great album--lots of good 80's tracks. Unfortunately all the recordings seem to be re-recordings. Listen to the previews, you'll see what I mean. The Kool & The Gang track is a painful example of this. Amazon should really indicate in the text that these are re-recorded versions of these songs."
5,The cajun is still rajun.,Thoroughly enjoyed this dvd and it has become a favorite of friends visiting my little music theatre.Cajun stripper is a great little number and the entire performance is solid.Still amazed at Doug's energy level for his age.I have just ordered my third copy of this dvd because my 2 others have been borrowed by friends and never returned.I just wish we could get more performances on dvd from this fun cajun.
4,He's Still Good!,"A very good DVD. Maybe not the videography of a James Taylor or Celine Dion, but there isn't as much money here.In answer to some of the the negative comments, I've been in the music field for many years, and no, there are no violinists behind the curtain like the Wizard of Oz. And yes, the musicians are playing, they're not all overdubbed. What would be the point of that, and how could you fool the audience?Doug's son is a remarkably good drummer and works perfectly with his dad. The others do a very good job too. Doug is having a great time. If you like Cajun music, you're not going to find anything better."
3,The Ragin' Cajun!,"Doug sounds wonderful, but the quality of the video is not all that terrific... too much ""panning"" and the venue is really not that well suited for his talents. He likes to move all around and the stage looked a bit small. The music is wonderful though!"
5,Pure Louisiana Cajun Music at it's Very Best!!!!!,"This was filmed in a small, up-close and personal venue, on a bayou in the Tampa, Florida area. Doug Kershaw and his band are fantastic. You get Doug on lead vocals & the fiddle, and also on the ""Squeeze Box"" (accordian) on some songs. Plus, you get a cajun ""washboard"" player, a piano player, drummer, guitarist, & bassist. Doug's son Tyler plays the drums.The songs are as follows:1.Introduction2.Diggy Diggy Lo3.Mama's Got the Know-How4.Louisiana Saturday Night5.Cajun Baby (in Dear Ole Louisiann)6.Colinda7.Jambalaya8.Cajun Stripper9.Don't Mess With My Toot Toot (This was a huge international hit for Louisiana's Rockin' Sidney back in the 1980's. On this song, Doug plays the ""squeeze box"".)10.Louisiana Man11.Orange Blossom SpecialOverall, this is simply 58 minutes of pure fun!!!! I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!"
4,Durable for a dirtbike,They are very durable. The letters are Kawasaki format but the green is slightly different from the original Kawasaki green. I liked them.
2,Inaccessible,"Denn's text is much shorter than most introductions to fluid mechanics, but he seems to have left out all of the material that would make the topic interesting and accessible to the novice. The topics are well-ordered and have a logical progression, but almost all of the explanatory matter is missing. It is extremely difficult to get a conceptual understanding of fluid dynamics by looking at page after page of variable manipulation. In addition, the index is so incomplete as to be useless; most of the terms one would look up are not listed, or point only to the page where it was cursorily defined.That said, this book can be salvaged for a class by a professor who is skilled at conveying concepts (rather than just equations.) I also suspect this book would be useful as a reference for those who have already learned the fundamental material. However, I recommend that the novice look elsewhere for a satisfactory introduction to fluid mechanics."
5,need to upgrade,Its a very powerful books but the programs need changes as you all have and old computer cannot use this version. I think spss should think the old model or put the label outside the cds that this programs need a better computer or speed or new monitor.
2,"Surely, they can do better!","I was disappointed by this CD. It seems the record company put together a bunch of songs they wanted to liquidate. I bought it because it had a Frankie Ruiz song on it, but ""Vuelvo a Nacer"" sounds like his illness had already distroyed his once wonderful voice. DLG's cover of ""Juliana"" succeeds more on the merit of the song than on the quality of this particular version. For real salsa fans, we are better off buying reissues and compilations of real salsa music. A la salsa de hoy le falta su sabor!"
3,Seersucker Whipsaw,"Had a hard time tracking this item down and when I did was quite pleased to know it was available. The problem arose when it was not able to be sent to Canada. I had to forward it to a known American address and then have it posted from there to here. I would like to be able to have titles sent direct to me without an outrageous mailing cost added to the purchase price. Books, anymore, are getting somewhat expensive.I'd be more inclined to shop your site if posting was a reasonable amount to our country."
3,Too brief,"A topic that deserves more exploration. Good effort, but not enough depth, and too brief to be representative of the people who found ways to become so integrated into their surroundings."
1,Not a Movie,"I was so disappointed when I realized that this was not a movie about Gregor Samsa, but a film about Nabokov reading and making comments on ""The Metamorphosis."" I had planned on showing it to my 12th grade seniors, but once I saw it, I knew that they wouldn't be able to sit still."
1,Not uplifting - poor sampling of LDS fiction!,"I found Orson Scott Card's book ""Saints"" (also known as ""A Woman of Destiny"") to be a poor sampling of LDS fiction. I have read many of Card's books and loved them, but I was very disappointed with this one. The first half of the book tells the story how Dinah Kirkman grew up in England and is VERY depressing. I continued to read the book with the hope that it would get better. It didn't! The story continues about Dinah's polygamous marriage to Joseph Smith then latter to Brigham Young. The story takes a very harsh view on Emma Smith, with her pushing Dinah down the stairs at one point which leads to Dinah's miscarriage of the prophet's son. The intimate relationships were too graphically described, everything from attempted rape to whore houses. Not an uplifting book at all!"
2,"Great visually, but wish they would talk!!!","I loved the visuals of this DVD and while there is an option to pick music as opposed to the natural sounds of the aviary (alot of parrots screaming and doing the ""natural"" things that birds do), it WILL teach your bird to scream in new and exciting ways if they listen to it repeatedly. I would have enjoyed hearing some talking parrots and would like to see a video with this. Not even necessarily a video that teaches parrots to talk but one that just has talking accompanying the video as opposed to screaming!"
2,2 for Effort,"Unless you want your birds to pick up some bad screaming habits, do not buy this...I have a green cheek conure and a cockatiel, and both birds showed no reaction to it. They showed more reaction to the cat-sitter video with wild birds. This video is basically a bunch of breeder birds squawking, eating and bullying for each other's food. It is the only video I found that was aimed at birds so I did enjoy the effort of someone else attempting to entertain birds while the humans are gone, but I believe this attempt was not successful (for my birds anyway). I think we'll stick with putting on Star Trek series for them.."
3,"Great Information, Poor Philosophy","I enjoyed this book on inner-city education immensely, despite disagreement with the author on certain solutions (for example, making the church a purely utilitarian instrument of educational change).Hale gives a realistic and tough assessment of African-American education and does offer several realistic solutions to educational problems in the inner-city.The book, although academically-challenging, is written in a conversational tone and is easy to comprehend."
1,SHOP AROUND!,"I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A LIGHT WEIGHT STROLLER FOR MY TWO YEAR OLD, I SAW THIS ONE AND LOVED IT, THE CUP HOLDERS FOR THE ADULTS AND KIDS ARE GREAT FEATURES. BUT SHOP AROUND, I FOUND IT AT A LARGE ""SUPER CENTER"" FOR 20 BUCKS LESS. SAME EVERYTHING.HOPE THIS HELPS."
1,There has to be better than this!,"I picture the author writing this book with a pile of old health and new age books all around her as a reference. This is general, elementary stuff that could easily be applied to any disease. ""Regular exercise,"" ""Eat good foods,"" ""Get lots of sleep,"" and other condescending axioms grace every page. Give me a break!"
2,Needs work,"Psoriasis is an inflammatory response. Your immune system is overactive. Helping to control it through diet is an essential part of succesful treatment. If you get that part out of this book, great. But the diet here is extreme as the nutritionist's review states. You're better off with a book on treating inflammation such as Floyd Chilton's ""Inflammation Nation"". Also, as for ""it works for me"", a day in the ocean does more good than any drug I've ever used. Sun and salt water are wonderfull, not to mention stress reducing. A win all the way around. Hope this helps some of you fellow sufferers."
1,"Please, don't waste your money","For all of us who suffer from this heartbreaking disease, this is yet another waste of money. You can get more information from the psoriasis newsgroup and the npf than you will ever get from this book."
1,the psoriasis cure,This book was very hard to follow did not give specific diet information and I would not recommend it at all. John Pagano's book Healing Psoriasis is 1000 times better.
4,Still remains a good reference book on menopause,"Even though this book was published in 1996, it remains a good reference book for ""women of a certain age"" and those who love them. I found particularly useful the section on symptoms of menopause to see if my experiences were connected or associated with something else. Also helpful are the tips on ways to relieve symptoms,including natural, non-HRT options. While research is always changing, from what I have read in medical newsletters much of this book is still very sound."
4,Hopelessly Romantic,"Where to begin, this book touched my heart maybe because it copied a portion of my life growing up. I think the way Susan Wiggs brings this book together is brilliant. This is a must read for the hopeless romantic out there. Happy reading."
3,"Same script, different people","All of these books seem to follow the same script...childhood friends reconnect and fall in love. Boooorrriiinnggg. This is the last book in the series that I have read because I read the reviews for all of the others. This book was a cute read, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,It's a cookbook!,"If I would have known that 1/3rd or so, of the book, was going to be a cookbook, I would not have downloaded it to my Kindle. It made me angry because I feel like I was duped into thinking I was reading an easy followup to Summer at Willow Lake and instead I had to bypass all the recipes in order to get to the main story. If you are not a baker as I am not, this is not worth the read."
2,The Winter Lodge (Lakeshore Chronicles 2),"I have a new favorite author!! Norah Roberts move over, I have another favorite author!! And I ESPECIALLY love these ""lakeshore chronicles""!! I totally recommend these if you are a Norah Roberts fan, or if you like a book that grabs you from the first page all the way to the end!"
3,The winter Lodge,My husband was going to order me a book for Christmas and he was not sure which Debbie Macomber books I had read. Below her book list was if you like Ms Macomber books you might like these books. I had been looking at the winter lodge book and was very glad that list was there for him to choose from.
3,The Winter Lodge,"I couldn't wait to start this book since I loved book 1 of the Lakeshore Chronicles series ""Summer At Willow Lake"" but this book didn't hold my interest like book 1. I thought the author repeated herself alot and her writing started to get a little immature and boring. Felt like I needed a little break from Susan Wiggs after this book but I plan on reading the rest of this series."
4,reread,The Winter Lodge has Jenny Dealing with the hardships of losing her grandmother just a few weeks before and dealing with her house burning down. Rourke the police chief that has known Jenny for years is trying to help her out and trying to get over the hidden love that he's felt for her since they were both kids. Daisy moves to Avalon and has some suprising news to tell her parents that will change her life forever. Also Daisy discovers some information about Jenny's past that even Jenny doesn't know. Even though this is a reread that I'm just now doing a review for it's a great book and series.
3,"Same Angst, Different People","Susan Wiggs is a great story teller and pulls each of her books together with vivid detail. But, why oh why, do the main character in the love story misunderstand each other so thoroughly and for so long? And never finally come together until the final 5 pages of the story! I found myself getting annoyed at the stupidity of the characters and all the angst and beating around the bush. There are several more books in this series and I really hope Ms. Wiggs changes it up a little (a lot). I don't think I can stand another 400 pages of two gorgeous people that are madly in love with each other, but stay apart because of whatever, blah, blah, blah. Please give us a happy ending in the middle of the story and an interesting plot to carry us to the final page."
2,To the narrator,"To the narrator Julia Gibson:-There is such a thing as `over-enunciating'-When you get to the end of phrases or sentences and you do that die-away-airs thing with your voice...that is very grating. It does `not' show feeling.-There are some clichés in this book that would be easier to overlook if you were reading them in a more casual manner.I'm not sure how I feel about the story itself. Her voice is so grating, it's hard to warm up to the story."
5,The best all around book about the roman republic.,"The great thing about this book is that it is written by an actual writer. Too many times i have picked up a history book by some famous historian and have found the sentances so convoluted that i could hardly find any meaning in them. Many historians have attempted to become authors and have failed. Asimov is a writer who has become a historian with sucess. This book offers a glimpse at the Roman Republic with the same depth as many well known historians, but is on a literary difficulty level equal to the cat in the hat. I have read many books that are slightly more indepth than this, but none that were written in a way so that the level of understanding of the roman republic even comes close to the level provided by asimov."
5,Useful but riviting history.,"Asmov covers this time in history with humor, realism and wit. It's acurate enough to be a source and enjoyable enough to just sit and read. I found his writing to be inpartial and eloquent."
4,The Roman republic,This is a companion book to another I have. It is a true history book. I got this after watching the HBO show ROME. It gives the true events of that time. The book was used but in good shape. I would recommend it to any history buff.
4,Great To Open The Mindset for Health for Those Over Fifty,"There are two things that I immediately like about this book: one, is that it is recognizing that it is not all over as for as health, strength and fitness just because you have hit 50, and two, that the use of progressive weight resistance is the key to youth and longevity. (I can speak from experience because I am 61 years young and I regularly practice weight training with barbells and dumbbells.)Any book that gets anyone started on the road to health mid-century is well worth reading."
4,A must in your collection.,"whereas the majority of the songs on this release can be found on other pig cds, the ones that aren't are deffinately worth picking up this one for. ""prime evil"" is one of the best pig songs i've ever heard, and even though i hate black sabbath, this cover of the song ""war pigs"" is wonderful. a deffinate must in your pig collection."
4,"impressed,but",i am impressed witht the collection of songs of Marc Antony however the songs do not include the ad lib versions as included on his other cds. They seem to cut the song off just when the real dancing part comes into play. I was very disappointed with that. The sound quality was awesome. I would recommend this CD but with a caveate that one would find that the fading of the tracks cuts off some of the best of each song.
4,shimmy shimmy and all that jazz,"Very good CD especially if you have bought the DVD The Art of the Drum solo. You do get a bonus CD with the DVD which is a lovely surprise, but the music used in the dance taught, is not the music on the free CD boo! Smart move from the manufacturers, Track 4 on Wasson Pharaon, however ,is very similar to the music used... which makes it easier for you to to perform the dance taught on the DVD....The other tracks on the CD are also excellent .....very suitable for tabla or dramatic dancing....and of course to shimmy shimmy"
3,Worse than BW 1 and 2,"I am big fan of Beethoven's wig 1 and 2 but this number 3 is not as good.Looks more like leftovers compiled from failed BW 1 and 2 songs to me. I gave even 3 starts mostly out of respect to the artist. BW 1 and 2 are always in CD holder of our family van. Number three will not be there (However, if I decide to make them mp3, I would add one on two songs from BW3 to the playlist)."
2,Doesn't Live up to the Others,"This CD is only worth listening to if you've already grown tired of volumes 1,2, and 4. The selections and the lyrics aren't nearly as funny nor as enjoyable by comparison.We have all four CDs and listen to the others repeatedly. They make great gifts and a wonderful way to introduce children (and their parents) to classical music."
2,My least favorite Beethoven's wig CD,"I was not pleased with the selections on this CD. The tunes are obscure and the lyrics are uninteresting on several of the tracks. There are 3 or 4 pretty good tracks, I do not use the others."
4,My least favorite,"We have all four Beethoven's Wig CDs and this one is my least favorite. My only complaint about this one is that some of the tracks are so short that by the time you are starting to get into it, it's over. Other than that we really enjoy the lyrics!"
5,Love You Like A Sister,"If you want to be a better best friend then this is the book for you.I would only recommend this book to you if you are a girl,because boys and girls act differently and the rules that are in this book are mostly for girls.The main character of this story is a girl named Camey Baker. This book will help you learn 30 new rules to make you a better best friend.The mystery to this story is that 2 girls absolutely hate each other but later in the story they become friends.Now the question to you is why did they hate each othere and how did they become friends?I do not want to spoil the ending,so read the book if you want to know what happend."
4,A no nonsense guide on how to be a best girlfriend,"It's so hard being a friend, particularly when you're a girl. Guys, when they're friends, when they get mad at each other they just punch each other. Girls don't do that. Girls follow a whole different set of rules, and sometimes the rules are really difficult to figure out. Like what do you do if you know a friend needs to talk, but she WON'T talk?!? Do you push her? Suppose that makes her mad at you? When is it ok to fight with a friend? Is it ok to tell a secret a friend told you? Camy Baker puts all the rules down in black and white. She gives examples from her own life, and tells you why things are the way they are. It would have been so much easier if I had had this book when I was trying to figure out my friends!"
5,Exactly what the Coleman Road Trip Grill needed for the big tank,"I purchased this hose and adapter for myColeman Road Trip Pro Grill SS, so that I could hook it to 20-gallon propane tanks. I had read that the attachment could be tricky, so my mechanically adept husband did the work of putting it together. He said the only thing he found tricky about it was the thread reversal; instead of the usual ""righty tighty, lefty loosie"" (right to tighten, left to loosen), he found that it was right to loosen and left to tighten. Otherwise, it is perfect for using the 20-gallon propane tank with the Coleman Road Trip grill. (The grill is portable, so is set up to only take the small camping-type propane tanks. One will need this hose and adapter for larger propane tanks.) The materials are durable heavy-duty, including the hose, which is long enough, as well."
4,Just what I ordered,I haven't used the hose yet but it's quite capable of doing the job I have in mind for it.
3,Just ok,Not the best material construction on this hose. Fairly cheaply constructed (hose and crimped ends to the fittings) but serves the purpose for connectivity to other Coleman appliances for occasional camping use.
3,Does the trick,"The hose is a good hose. The connection to the propane tank is not as good as the attachments on the end of other hoses I have seen, but it does what I need it to do, even if that means I have to work a little harder to make sure it is tight."
2,It works but....,"Feels weak and no doubt made of cheap parts. I don't even use it anymore because I think it leaks propane. Used it about 10 times before deciding it wasn't worth the risk. If anyone knows of a sturdier and higher quality replacement, please leave your comment to this post."
4,Expensive,"The product works fine, but it is very expensive and doesn't come with the Coleman grill. I didn't realize the hose to the tank was not a ""lefty-loosey"" and ended up cranking it with a wrench too tight. When I realized what was going on, I already ruined the hose and had to replace it. I bought an aftermarket hose at a hardware store and it didn't work properly. There is an connection in the Coleman hose that allows the gas to flow properly. I know Coleman gets more money because they have a proprietary hose, but it is a shame they charge over $25 for something that costs $6 everywhere else. I will mark this new hose with a tag that says ""NOT lefty-loosey""."
3,Buy your hose at Tractor Supply,"Don't buy this for $20.85, go to Tractor Supply and get the same hose but 12 foot long, for $24.00. It is the same hose used for Mr. Heater. It works just as good, and alot cheaper. Colemans has a price set on all of their items, went to the outlet store and it was more expensive than Amazon. This is the only problem with Coleman, they want a arm and a leg for their products."
1,I guess mine was defective. It didn't work.,"I guess mine was defective. It didn't work. I tried connecting then unconnecting. Tried a different lp cylinder. It just didn't work with the grill (Cuisinart cgg200).In fairness it does say on the box to use only with Coleman products however it doesn't say that in the description. I can't see how it would work exclusively with coleman products or how it didn't work at all seeing as how it seems like a relatively straight forward piece of hardware. Anywho, it went back to amazonland for a refund. I ran to the local hardware store and they had a hose that works."
1,It just doesn't work!,"I ordered the Coleman High-Pressure Propane Hose and Adapter for my new Coleman Gas grill. I then went to a local Lowe's and purchased a large full tank of gas (Rhino, a standard brand), as I was going to leave the grill on my deck and not take it anywhere. I asked my nephew to connect the gas, as he does LOTS of grilling at his home. There is no way the end that connects to the tank of gas fits the gas cannister. It will NOT attach, and therefore I had to send my nephew back to Lowe's to get the small cannisters of gas so we could continue with our cookout. I'm going to send this thing back. It says it attaches to all types of gas cannisters, so I have no clue as to why it would not hook onto the Rhino tank. I'm upset!"
1,Not as it is described in the web page at all,"In its web page, it says to work with the model of Colman portable stove. But it does not at all. It is misleading information in its web description. I returned it to amazon."
4,easy to use,"It is very easy to connect a coleman road trip grill with is hose to my 20-lb tank. Work as a charm. The shipping was fairly fast. The only complain is now amazon started to charge tax in my state. That sucks. Otherwise, it is a good hose."
5,Tank Hose,Very happy with this hose. It does exactly what it should. 5 feet is fine for me but some might want a longer hose.
4,Works Well With Other Brand Names,"Seems like OK quality for Coleman. I used this on a 20 pound Worthington propane tank and a Camp Chef Mountain Series stove and had no serious issues with it. It feels like the plastic knob is going to break after just a few uses. The only other detail is that the clear/white cap is a bit loose and falls off easily. Not a big issue, but I would love to keep it as a dust cover."
5,Great if you want to stop buying little bottles,"Well made, durable no brainer purchase to allow use of 'big' propane bottles on little bottle appliances. Quality is very good, so is price: you'll save money!"
1,Dissapointing,"I purchased this to go with my Coleman Roadtrip grill. I should have tried it before I went camping Memorial Day weekend. The needle valve in the end that connects to the regulator was so far down inside the fitting that the stem on the regulator would not push it in, thus having to resort back to expensive 1lb. throw aways for the weekend. Very dissapointing for a Coleman product. Amazon was fantastic with the return."
4,connects 20# tanks to portable burners,"This hose connects to the burners (or in my case the Weber Performer charcoal grill).One end has the right kind of threads to take the place of a disposable propane tank, like you'd use for a camp stove.The other end has a Left-hand thread that goes into the 20# propane tanks you'd use for a gas grill. Watch out for the backwards threads. Works great so far.6 Feet is plenty long for what I'm doing.My only gripe is that the price for these is higher than I'd expect for a hose with no valves."
3,Not compatible with the Coleman RoadTrip LXX--at least not in my case,"Amazon shows this hose as an accessory for the Coleman LXX camping grill, so I purchased this Coleman product for adapting to 20lb propane bottles. But as other reviewers have commented, for some reason the mechanism at the grill end of the hose does not open to allow proper gas flow. However, both Amazon and the seller were quite cooperative with the return process, which I appreciate. I was able to buy a cheaper, fully functional version at a local hardware store."
5,Worked for me!,"Tried this out with my new Coleman stove and propane tank and it worked without a hitch. I was able to keep the stove going all day and had plenty of propane left in the tank. And, better than polluting the environment with disposable propane bottles. Great to have in an emergency too."
5,"OK, but the other one seems better made","I tried this hose and it worked but I got this other one and it seems better made and I like the end on this one better that goes on the tank. I use it with me Coleman heater that takes one pound bottles. With this hose I use a 5# bottle, I got the 5# bottle because I didn't want to lug a 20 pounder around.The rating is for the one from Camping World http://www.campingworld.com/shopping/item/5-propane-hose-assembly/30338"
4,A must to use regular propane tanks with your Coleman grill,"I bought this when I bought myColeman 9949-750 Road Trip Grill LXE. It was going to be my primary grill and wanted to use a regular size propane tank with it, which I could not do without this adapter. It does it's job, but is slightly pricey. That said, I figure I have paid for this purchase over its lifetime by not buying all the mini cylinders I would have had to use otherwise. If you are going to use the Coleman Road Trip Grill as your primary home grill, I think this is a must buy."
1,dead on arrival,"I bought this hose with a coleman stove. The stove works fine on 1lb propane bottles. The stove will not work with this hose and a 20lb propane tank. The hose is installed correctly, but gas will not flow between the hose and stove. I can hear the gas flow between hose and 20lb tank. Hose is also poor build quality, having a cheap plastic hand screw for connection to the propane tank."
5,Save those little tanks,"Bought this for my table top heater. Normally a 1 gallon tank would last 2-3 hours, which is fine for a night event but after 5-10 days $$$ adds up. Now I can hook my backup propane tank on my grill and heat away all night long without any worries. This think pays for itself in a matter of days. Now I just wish I could use it more often here in AZ. P.S. I regret paying for upgraded shipping since I found out that the distribution warehouse is local."
3,Low-budget printing job,"This may be the best that's available, but it looks like it was printed from the plates made for the hardback edition. I've seen that too, and neither one has much page margin--the type goes almost to the page edges. Moreover, there's a surprising number of typos and missing or mangled words. Having said that, it's a fine and well-written yarn."
3,Weak link of Prototype series,"I LOVE prototypes 1,2 and 3; with 2 being the strongest by far. However, 4 seemed to have a completely different style. It's like the dark side of progressive house while 1, 2 and 3 were trance (CD2) and d'n'b (CD1).Not what I expected..."
2,Hardcore Trance At Its Worst,"To each his or her own when it comes down to music...but man, I can't understand how this album can be satisfying to anyone. Granted electronica comes in all shapes and sizes, and there is usually a genre to suit everyone...so I guess this is just one of those albums pack full of tracks that I don't like and others do.To be the devil's advocate though...this album lacks any artistic flare. No rhythm, very little tempo flux, and a complete abscence of harmonics and melody. Those of you who prefer the musical journey versus a bunch of high energy, high tempo tracks that are strung loosely together should stay clear of this one.Disc 1 gets 1.5/5 stars. Disc 2 gets 2/5."
3,stagnant outdated sound.,"I would not have expected this album to be as similar to the last. The ""blueprint for the future"" After Listening to Timo Maas(***%) Transport 4 (***%) the Danny Howells Nocturnal Frequencies Anthology(*****)!!! and Disc one of Rennaisance Desire(****%), Rennaissance Progression(****)as well as Sander Klienenberg's Nu Breed(*****)all last week, I could have thrown this in the trash with that george acosta awake album I bought a while ago. I'm not even interested enough to warm up to it. How can the boxed boys produce an album that doesn't even read in english. The sleeve notes are for an individual with a vocabulary in the 20th percentile, obviously this is the amount of intelligence going into this album. Go pick up John digweed's latest, broaden your palate.After that awful steve Lawler set they produced, Darren emerson's boring set, now this. I'm wondering if the boxed boys really are mortal afterall."
1,Way too progressive,"First off, I am a trance DJ, and know my trance well. I liked the funky trance of Prototype 1, but when I heard this, I wanted my money back. This CD is maad progressive and chill. Nothing to make you want to move, unless you really like way progged trance.By the way, I just saw seb fontaine live, and he [was] so bad that I had to leave the room. And I even LIKE trance. How bout that?"
5,Saved!,"Hey Bubba, how'd ya like to save $30-60 on this one? Check out the cd CARNAVALS on the Prestige-Fantasy records and get 2 great aqlbums on one cd for like $12-15! Yes Virgina, both Limbo Carnival and the even more gorgeous Bossa Nova Carnival featuring Kenny Burrell are the way to go. Of course also check out Louie Ramirez and Cal Tjader albums."
3,educational review,"As a high-school teacher for English foundations, I try my best to expose my students to the literature their peers in regular English classes receive. I must utilize movies as a visual aide supplement to help them connect with the characters, setting, dialogue... I strongly recommend using this dvd to support your curriculum to teach on all levels of student learning (auditory, kinesthetic, visual).On a personal note for this actual movie, it was at times a bit boring and my students nodded off a few times."
3,"Well acted by Day-Lewis, yet still overrated","Day-Lewis is absolutely terrific in a tough role to make convincing, but I do disagree with most critics that it was any kind of masterpiece. Why do they say it is unsentimental when indeed it often is (at least to me it is). Though there are indeed gripping moments, the story has better potential than this and too often resorts to cliches. Yet overall, a pretty good view."

3,Here's why:,"The Irish brogue is hard enough to decipher, but Amazon instant movies does nothave ""closed caption""ing"". This makes it difficult to hear/understand...the movie itself is wonderful! I highly recommend it for anyone who can pick upall of the words the first time. It is very difficult. However, the story, if you readahead of time in Wikipedia, is so compelling, that you can put the scenes togetherpretty much without picking up all the words.I wish so much that Amazon instant movies would provide ""closed captioning""the way NETFLIX does!!!"
4,my left foot,my left foot is a wonderful movie it shows people that people with diabilities can do everything they put their minds to!
4,Powerful and utterly real,"Watching this, its almost hard to imagine it is based off a completely true story. It didnt come as a complete surprise however to witness Daniel Day-Lewis act is arse off like nobody could. There are not enough words to describe his performance. An oscar well deserved. The film itself feels a tad bit dated but it doesn't deter from the fact that this is a wonderful and powerful movie that should be seen by all."
3,The Movie gets 5 stars! The DVD gets 0!,"This is a great film that deserves better. It's a shame when you can get a VHS copy that is better than the DVD. I cannot recommend the DVD much at all unless you find it very cheap.The movie on the other hand is very good. Like In The Name of the Father & The Boxer which came later, My Left Foot has great characters with wonderful actors. I initially thought it was going to be a light comedy. Boy was I wrong. Definitely worth renting and then wait for a company to release a good DVD."
5,OUTSTANDING,"SOOO well done it will send chills up your spine. What a tremendous accomplishment for Daniel Day-Lewis but all the acting was simply superb. Highly, HIGHLY recommended."
4,kind of a gritty movie,A poor Irish family has more room for the cripple than most rich families ever make.A man who paints with his left foot and learns to talk at 19 issomeone who is entirely different than ordinary people.What is inside his head is not reflected by how he is able to movehis body. Once he learns to type there seems to be no stopping him?Daniel Day-Lewis has been one of my favorite actors since I sawThe Last of the Mohicans (Director's Expanded Edition).Bringing to life this special person makes him a special actor.It seems strange that out of such a gritty grinding poorplace should come a picture of courage and endurance for us all.
4,"Great film, brilliant book",Christy Brown is a stud.Daniel Day-Lewis' acting is superb.Adored both film and book.
5,My Left Foot,"This movie allowed my students to see what happened to Christy Brown after the time covered in the short story about him, ""The Letter 'A'."" It is not for the faint-hearted; but well worth viewing."
5,Thank you Amazon,"My daughter loved this movie when it first came out, and always wanted a copy, but could never find it in the stores. I finally found it online at Amazon, and she was very happy at Christmas to receive this movie. Thanks Amazon."
1,Not that good,"Besides the final song, which is alright everything else is not worth the money I paid for it. There is only 45 minutes worth of music, what happened to the rest of the CD?"
5,Awesome Collection,This is a great movie collection by a great movie director in Christopher Nolan. All of these movies are superb!
5,SO GOOD. GREAT GIFT.,"I bought this this my friend who is a big Christopher Nolan fan. He loved it. He was excited about all the extra, awesome stuff in the box set as well. Great for anyone who loves C.N. films or whoever just happens to like all five of these movies."
1,Outside Of Cover Box Was Ripped,"I really love the movies and love the price of this product. One star still might be a little too low of a rating, but I was disappointed that the box set cover was torn. It was ripped all the way across the box. I don't know how this went unrealized, but makes me a little unhappy. Overall, the movies are still great, just not what I am used to with amazon..."
3,Overall happy,"Only 4 out of the 5 discs work for us - one of the discs has a region lock on it and even though our DVD / Blu-ray player has had the region lock removed, we can't play it.The printed covers on a couple of the discs look a bit dodgy - like they are copies someone has done on their home printer.Overall, we're pretty happy - 4 out of 5 for the price isn't bad and the sleeves don't matter to us."
5,An Incredible Collection,I purchased this collection when it was only $25 and it was more than worth it. The video quality is excellent and this is a great addition to anyone's blu-ray collection.
4,Good movies,"Of the five films I'll take 3, Batman movies do not convince me much, the audio quality don't like me (I think we are now with DTS) the price is acceptable, thanks Amazon for bringing these films to Peru, I have no complaints"
1,PACKAGE NOT RECEIVED,I have yet to receive the Director's collection. Hopefully this has not happened to anyone else that purchased this item.
5,"Christopher nolan, Like his movies Dark Knight? Prestige? Buy this now!","Do you like any of Christopher Nolan movie on this movie?Did you like the movie ""Prestige""?Can you afford this?If you answered Yes to 2 of 3 above question just buy it now"
5,"duh, he's a genius and these are all classics","what do we have to write to make you realize Nolan is a class act genius that can do no wrong, the weakest link is Insomnia, and even that is a very interesting movie, when your worst movie is still almost a classic, it says a lot about Nolan's abilities as a story teller"
5,Amazing value for an amazing collection,"The 5 movies alone should be well worth the price of admission (That's like only paying 6 bucks per disc if you get this at the $30 price point!). The bonus booklet, photo cards, and collectors box are all very nice additions to the set as well, especially given the already incredible price point.Beyond all of that, the real reason to adopt this box set early is the $8 movie cash that you get towards seeing The Dark Knight Rises. It has to be used prior to Aug 5th, 2012, but if you were planning on seeing the movie anyway, you might as well grab this box set sooner rather than later! That essentially makes it only about $22 - $25 bucks for the box set itself!Again, all features of this collection are well worth the price of admission."
5,Really good collection for the price,It's a really good collection for movie collectors/lovers. Specially who want's to see movies in a large TV with high performance sound system. All the movies are good except Insomnia. Dark knight and Inception comes with 2 blu-ray discs for each movies with all extra features added.
4,"A great story, despite the lengthy jargon","I enjoyed the central story development of Kate and Cole's life. The kids were adorable as well. The author could have cut out a 1/4 of the book, though, but pulling out all the extra jargon of each character looking 'inside themself'. It seemed 50% of the dialogue was a character thinking and talking to themself. The story about Cole and his father seemed out of place and realizations hit him at weird times, like when he was in the tent and Kate was kidnapped. Is that a time to really take out your anger on your dad leaving you 20-some yrs ago? If you skim these dialogues, which I started doing, you will find the story interesting and leave you wanting to know more about this new family unit."
5,Western romance with characters you'll care about,"A well-written novel that had me hooked from the first page. Ms. Porter creates characters that are intriguing and believable with emotional depth and integrity. Several elements of this novel were compelling, particularly the setting of the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 and the way the heroine Kate comes to terms with a situation most women would find crushing. It is easy to sympathize with Kate and Cole as they struggle to escape their respective pasts and find a future together. All-in-all, a carefully written, well plotted romance novel with characters that make the reader care about them. What more could you want?"
1,Why do I bother with these books?,"I don't quite know why I do this to myself. Maybe it is just the long commute. I knew within a few pages that this book was going to be one of those that you roll your eyes at the characters and even more at the author. There was very little intelligence in this book. The author practices one of my pet peves, which is to repeat information so many times (and each time it is repeated it sounds like she forgot she already told us this information) that you want to gag on the words. The author's manner of making the characters rationalize to themselves for a few pages at a time several times gets old the first time around. I have always hated when an author makes her characters contradict themselves and do stupid things for the sake of having a daring rescue, etc. I did actually read the whole book, and if this is any indication of Cheryl Anne Porters talent, I definitely will not be reading any more of her work. A real thumbs down."
2,Not as expected,"Purchased to use on the front floor ""hump"" on my classic car. Had to modify and add weight to keep it from tipping over and pouring it's contents of CDs, notepads and pens under my feet."
1,Avoid this outdated difficult to use product unless,"Avoid this outdated, difficult to use product unless you own a copy of Aagard's book ""Excelling at Chess Calculations"" and own Chess playing software like Fritz. By itself the CD is a confusing mess presented as a series of chess problems. You get to guess at the correct decision but there is no discussion of why the decision you made is wrong nor is there any direction on how to make better decisions if you do not have the book. Further, this is old (circa 2006)and there are better programmed chess instruction software packages out there now. Look through the Fritz trainer offerings on the web."
2,Too Stiff,I knew the price was too low for a leather bag...but I was hopeful. It feels cheaply made and extremely stiff. The shoulder straps are not long enough for me either. The bag arrived crammed in a box without any wrapper around it and bag is a little dinged up. There was only one little tag on the bag. There wasn't even any paperwork with it. Won't buy from this company again.
4,Excellent Sound Quality Yet Very Disappointing Design,"I find it hard to rate this product. On the one hand, it has a supperb sound quality - as expected from Plantronics. I'm able to have conversations while driving where my car stereo is blasting yet I'm heard lout and clear on the other end and have no problem with hearing the caller.However, when it comes to the design...The ear piece is awkwardly attached to the ear from the bottom and relyig on squishing my earlobe betweem the two parts of the ear piece. After a while is just hurts! Lucky I only use it in my car for very short conversations, otherwsie I doubt if I would keep it. I think that piece was designed for a very different ear then mine. I guess my ear is a bit to small for it.Still overall I'm happy with it. So hence a 4 star rating."
5,excellent,Earth School is a simple yet thorough illustration of what really matters in life. The video is interesting to watch with beautiful images and the content is easy to follow and very eloquent. I would recommend this DVD for anyone young or old who craves reminders of what life is really all about.
5,"""THE NOISE IS WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR""","This CD is da bomb the musica is pumping-non stop and will really get ""into ya"" Play it loud and Jam."
3,Iran-Iraq War in the Air 1980-1988,"The book could have definitely used proofreading before being published. It's loaded with grammar and punctuation errors. It also uses many abbreviations that are not in the abbreviation glossary. Otherwise it is loaded with incredibly detailed factual information, which surely must have been a challenge to obtain. I wished it had more personal/first hand accounts from the pilots, but it didn't. I liked it though because it covered a subject I'm interested in, which is otherwise not covered in such detail, or at all, by other authors and publishers. I found the coverage of U.S. assistance to both Iran and Iraq to especially interesting."
4,Business as Ministry,"Excellent work on the subject of how we can change our world through ""secular"" influences. I'd recommend it for business persons and ministers."
4,Moster Pod,"I had seen a Monsterpod that a friend had. It looked interesting so I purchased one from you. I have to tell you, it does everything my friend said and more. The first thing I did was stick my Monsterpod on a tree in my front yard. It held that camera in place! I then found a fence to put my camera upside down. It worked there. I've tried it on everything from my car window to a old pier post. I don't know how this silly putty works but it works.The only downside I've found is it may pick up some wood particles, if I put it on a tree, but I was able to pull those out and I've now used it for a week in all sorts of places. I'm going on a trip soon and I can't wait to take it with me to include my wife and I in our pictures."
1,"Cute idea, but not practical for age range.","My son received this as a gift. The age range specified is actually too young to understand the concept that you can only squeeze the gas or brake hand control. If both are squeezed at the same time, the fuse blows and then the thing doesn't go. Try explaining this to a two year old. It's like patting your head and rubbing your tummy!! Of course we didn't have the right fuses on hand either, so the same day he received it, my son couldn't use as intended."
4,My niece loves her new hog,"Well i new that my young niece would need to have some time to ""grow into"" this gift, but she has a blast riding it around, the only thing a baby might not like about it would be that the electric motor is very loud, especially if you're combining that sound with the hardwood floor or linoleum that it basically has no other option but to roll on as this scooter literally has less than 3/4"" ground clearance so shag carpet or rough sidewalks are all out of the question. Make no mistake it's for inside, and it's kinda noisy, but when I see my one year old niece chasing a 10 year old pitbull around the kitchen with while laughing hysterically, it makes the noise music to my ears."
1,Wasted Money,"Oh my goodnes! I bought this toy online ... thinking it was a wonderful buy. It arrived today and is much smaller than I anticipated, much too small for my very petite 3 year old who only weighs 27lbs. After FIVE minutes the first fuse blew. I was unable to speak to anybody at Chicco and no-one has returned my call as yet. ...A HUGE disappointment for me and my daughter. Please save yourself the time and money."
1,Mom of 2 year old,"Cute idea, disappointing toy. I purchased this toy for my daughter on her birthday. Within 2 minutes of riding we had to change the fuse. Two minutes later the fuse blew again. Maybe this is why they include two spare fuses. I've read elsewhere it has to do with pushing the Vespa manually at the same time of activating the go/reverse handle. I don't know if this is true but either way it's frustrating and annoying. Also my daughter is 30+ pounds and 31+ inches and although she still fits, it's quite small. She really enjoyed the ride down the hallway. Too bad it didn't work past that. It's now on it's way to be returned."
1,Outdated TV,"Mitsubishi makes good TVs but this one is old. I have 2 purchased 6 years ago and served me well. OK if you found a new one very cheap and could live with it - i.e. around $300 NEW. Picture and sound quality is good but design is very outdated - 4 stars 6 years ago 1 star now. This is an old chunky DLP analog TV and won't receive standard digital broadcast without a conversion box. Very slow turn on and turn off. Off course, not really high def either, 720p only. I have replaced lamps on both of them and one is dead now."
3,A fair value at a bargain price...,"This is a SONY mish mash promotional compilation. It is sprinkled with a few big name artists performing some interesting song arrangements. The remainder of the program is basically pleasing, filled by virtual unknowns. Whether it's bolero or jazz; who knows? This set makes pleasant background listening!"
3,where o whereo you bolero,"I thought this would be music combining the romantic ballad Bolero with jazz. There is very little Bolero music, two or three of Latin singers singing in Spanish. The vast majority of music is New Age or easy listening Jazz. If authentic Bolero is NOT your cup of tea then you might like this as background music."
1,What a misleading title,"Aside from a few tracks by Getz, Brubeck and Santana, this album crosses the line from being music to muzak. It stinks and it was a major disappointment to open it, listen to it and find out that it was not at all what it seems it would be. Don't buy this if you want jazz or bolero. Buy it if you want elevator music."
5,Can't wait wait for the next issue,"The variety of music and artist of high caliber is awesome,as is the quality of the recording.I can't wait for the next issue of Bolero & Jazz."
5,I am one of the woman in the book,"I absolutely LOVE this book, and no it's not just because I'm in it! I am unfortunately in the miscarriage section and since I was interviewed for the book in 96, I had yet another miscarriage. I have now had three miscarriages, but do have a healthy four year old daughter. I remain positive though. I was so excited to get this book home and see where I was in it, but REALLY found out how remarkable this book is. I was amazed with the amount of information on every subject, and will give this book to my sister Laura as soon as she finds out she is expecting. If you just found out your pregnant....this is the ONLY book you'll need! Sharon Heaps"
2,Kultur should've done justice to this great performance.,"I won't say anything about the performance itself except that I think this is truly the greatest performance that any version of Romeo and Juliet could show, but I can't stand what Kultur had done to this film. The original playing time of this performance is about 150 minutes like that of Maximova and Vasiliev(VAI), but Kultur cut out about 40 minutes worth out of the film. The Bolshoi Ballet performed the whole of the work, and all of it was filmed without any part of it being cut out. Anyone who ever saw the whole of this very performance like on TV could see what I'm saying. I suspect why Kultur cut out 40 minutes is because they didn't want to make dual layered DVD(DVD-9) which can contain more than 120 minutes(up to 240 minutes). They just put in 108 minute performance in a single layered DVD(DVD-5) which can contain up to 120 minutes."
3,Discontinued product,"Tested on my Car PC , Card is great, but doesn't play all channels through the line in, only front channels.Resource hungry.Discontinued - replaced by Audio Advantage SRM."
5,Well Built and Easy to Use,"The title said it all. The hitch pin fits a 2"" receiver perfectly. The lock works smoothly and I like the way you simply push a button to engage it. I've had other locking pins and like this one the best."
4,Brought back memories,This a great ablum. It brought back so many good memories of a time when love songs were really great.
5,Best roasting stick ever!,"My husband and I got a set of these as a wedding gift. We have used them many times. Our kids have used them many times. They are great! They are durable and will last a long time. We are replacing our set, due to the unfortunate circumstances of leaving them at a camp fire out of state. The best feature by far is the curved back prongs that keep your food on your fork, instead of falling into the fire right when your marshmallow is all gooey and wonderful inside.They are metal and they do get hot, so watch for kids swinging them around. Clean up is a breeze. Just leave them in the fire until the food residue burns off, let them cool and then pack them away again.These are truly a must-have for any campfire roasting activities!"
2,not what I ordered,The item pictured is not the item I received. The one I received will suffice for my purposes but it is clearly inferior to the one pictured.
4,Great all round Discoverer book.,"I have used Oracle Discoverer for years now (ie: v.3.0, etc.) and I wished many times to have a book that I could look through when I needed help. I've taught courses in Discoverer at numerous companies to hundreds of users and this book would be an excellent resource for end-users to have. For the more advanced users there's plenty of information included as well. Having this book on my bookshelf by my computer is good and bad. Good - because there's always something I have to look up (even if I already know it, it's good to know it's there); and bad - because when an end-user sees the book, they always want to borrow it.I would give this book high marks as it's a good all round reference and learning book."
4,Great for end-users - not much here for Administrators,"Lots of tips, tricks etc. for end users trying to learn Discoverer.Lacks best practices, installation/configuration options for Administrators. Unfortunately, this seems to be the only book available covering Oracle Discoverer. For Administrators, the only available resource is Oracle Documentation."
1,Not for the Discoverer Administrator,"While this book may be useful to the uninitiated, it is useless for the administrator. There is only one very small chapter on administration, and it does not provide any useful help.This book would have been much better if it addressed all the issues that an administrator needs to do to set up the environment for the users."
3,Stunning but slow,"I never would have known this was illustrated by Stuart Immonen if the cover hadn't told me. Acclimatized to Immonen's streamlined, cartoony images, the unique, rotoscoped style of Secret Identity came as a shock.Busiek has definitely buttered his bread with stories about the real-life burdens of being a superhero (see: Astro City), and, in Secret Identity, he's proven that he's up to the task of giving a bit of emotional gravitas to the two-dimensional Superman. In fact, he occasionally skids dangerously close to making the World's Greatest Superhero too whiny.Although each chapter is good, the whole package feels a bit jumpy - I'm not sure it could have been fleshed out more without becoming boring, but the transitions through Superman's life felt a bit abrupt."
5,Secret,This is very well written and the story flows.It is a new take on what it means to be Superman.
1,Sony Model KDL-46VE5 Reviews,"Last week, I purchased the Sony televsion model KDL-46EV5 and paid ""big bucks"" for it at a local Howard's appliances and big screen superstore. It was defective right out of the box. Two of the HDMI ports don't work. Sony Corp. helped me set up a service call with their repair technician and he identified a problem with the main board. He suggested replacing the board. Since this is a brand new unit purchased a couple of days ago, I asked for replacement of the TV. Howard's would not replace the television. Sony Corp. was not of any help. These people at Howards are unprofessional and would not honor their own policy of exchanging the defective unit within the first 30 days. I purchased a brand new TV and not a ""Refurbished"" TV and therefore I would not settle to repair a TV that I just purchased.I would not buy any Sony products and will never visit Howard's appliances chain stores in Southern California."
3,Light reading on a heavy subject.,"A judge a book by the number of lines I underline. This had about 4. It consists of 1-2 page essays on body-image, dieting and beauty issues. I wished the essays were longer and more factual. It is a helpful read if you are studying self-acceptance,but by far the best book on the subject is, ""How Much Does Your Soul Weigh?"" by Dorrie McCubbrey."
3,"A good, basic guide for a first-time visitor","My husband and I bought this book for a recent vacation, and we found it very helpful. We used it to tool around the island in a rented car, see the sights in the Waikiki area, and snoop around Chinatown. It gives a good, broad overview to first-time visitors that will help you prioritize what you want to see on the island.A few caveats - driving directions to Lanikai Beach are a bit lacking in this guide; fare for TheBus is now $2 per person, not $1.50; and the Lyon Arboretum was closed uring our visit. Sin of omission - Wo Fat's restaurant in Chinatown is a great dim sum place, but is not included in the guide. As always, call to check on guidebook facts before venturing out. Other than a few discrepancies such as this, we found the book to be fairly accurate and very informative."
3,"Good, but there are better books available","We've used Frommer's books before, and enjoyed them, but found this book sadly lacking. It does help you pick out the highlights to budget your time, but too many other travel books exist that are simply better. We also found the maps sadly lacking when driving around the island, and at times were completely incorrect. Some information is out of date (hours of operation, prices), but no book is perfect in that regard.We did greatly enjoy the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed book we used on the same trip. Unfortunately, this publisher does not offer a book on Oahu."
4,downloaded from amazon to kimble,"A good read we defenately will go here next year.After reading this book we hope to spend at least 10 days in Oahu with a week each on other islands. We have been here before only for short times but after reading this book we realize how much more there is to see especially involving the history of Hawaii which interest us greatly. I would recommend this book to any one wanting to visit Oahu, reading the restaurant reviews I started to feel very hungry can hardly wait to we go.Still not much for the handicapped person especially mobility impaired persons using wheelchairs or electric scooters which must include many people nowadays need to know these things as we can't catch buses or walk distances."
5,Is justice ever really served?,"Ariel Dorfman was a Chilean exile who feared that he might ""disappear"" if he attempted to live and work under the Pinochet dictatorship. ""Death and the Maiden"" is a sort of autobiography for Dorfman. The play centers around the character of Paulina, a woman who ultimately kidnaps the man she suspects of holding her prisoner and presiding over her torture and rape many years ago. It's a suspenseful play that tackles the issues of justice and retribution, but it also has elements of suspense and mystery: is Dr. Miranda really the person that Paulina thinks he is? This is an excellent play that's fairly well-known, yet it's hardly ever staged for some reason, which is a shame. (Note: Never, EVER subject yourself to the Sigourney Weaver/Ben Kingsley movie version. It is so awful.)"
1,"""Sex in the City"" in print isn't needed or good","What a complete pile of fluff. If someone used these ideas to select a partner it wouldn't last more than a few months. The giddy, well-informed ideas are more Tiger Beat than advice for an adult. This has ""happy pills"" written all over it. Real life is not referenced here, ""Sex and the City"" is the basis."
1,EXPERT????,"I have read both of this author's previous books and came away impressed. However, this recent piece of work ""Better Off Wed?,"" has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. How can a so called ""relationship expert"" give advice about men when they can't handle their own personal relationships. What a bizarre world we live in. Next time i'll read a book on quitting poor habits by a former drug addict."
2,If Alison James is an expert on relationships....,"...then we're all going to be miserable, lonely singletons someday. This book was full of nothing new. There are a couple of places where I smiled but only because the writing was poor, there was a real lack of substance and some of the points she tried to make were inane and insane. The best thing about it is the title, unfortunately. Since we already know that, I recommend buying a better written book on a more interesting subject."
5,Exactly as described and shipped fast,The parallel cable that I ordered was exactly what the item was described as and it shipped fast. Quality of the cable was also good.
4,Not a TOWEL Hook,"This ROBE hook has the advantage that it keeps a hanger in place. A little crazy to mount (a ring is taped to the body and this need to be left in place) which is why I gave it four stars. My wife says it has worked fine for her purposes. It is heavy and flexes the hollow core door. It can be mounted opposite to the picture to hold items with loops. Towels no, Robes yes !!"
2,my towel falls off a lot,"It looks nice, but my towel slips off far too often. Plan on carefully draping your towel over the hook."
4,Great Superbowl Moments,I actually bought this as A replacement set for A lost disc. NFL Films does an excellent job of capturing the drama of the Superbowl. Each dvd includes a season highlight reel that really goes in depth. The only problem I have is with the packaging. In both sets the glue that holds the place holders has dried up and caused them to fall out of the case. other than that I highly recommend the set.
5,NFL Films......,"......has done it again. NFL Films has been capturing the essence of professional football for many years now and once again have done themselves proud. They always get the great angles moments and shots of the gridiron action, especially at the SuperBowl. It is amazing to watch the first three installments of this series and compare just how far the sports film industry has come in 40 years. And yet, the drama of the game and players are still the best parts of NFL Films productions. SB31-40 will be enjoyed by both the avid fan as well as the casual viewer for years to come. Add it to your DVD library!"
4,Super Bowls 31-40,Very good videos. It really brings to life the drama of the seasons and the only thing I would change would be some of the final outcomes haha
1,1 star for the extras,"I was very disappointed by this collection of broken Highlights. I was expecting something very different, not the slow motion action shots, poor camera angles, dreadful background music and slow and boring narration. Where was the big hits, the great passes and extended highlights of the games themselves. Living in Australia we only get one game of NFL shown on TV a year which is the super bowl so I was hoping to see lots of football action in real time replays with plays in chronological order. It would have been a lot more exciting for the viewer to hear the roar of the crowds and the television commentators providing colourful commentary instead of the boring dribble. The picture quality on DVD is very good however, I will say that."
1,"You're in a contract, Verizon isn't","Just so you know, Verizon can/will change the terms of the contract without letting you out of the contract (i.e. raising the price of text messages) You have to pay more, it doesn't change your contract, you still have the early termination fee.Also, Verizon customer service reps are about the least helpful I've ever dealt with"
1,Worst ever service,"They kept my order on hold without notifying me for a month, even after so many followups !"
2,Reese Towpower locks.,"Had the Reese Sleeved lock on my Tow Hitch Step for a year now & damn if I can get the thing off !!! We have tried Graphite (dry) Graphite Liquideverything short of cutting the thing off. The key (a flat one) won't BUDGE in the lock.Newer Reese towpower locks have round keys (like Vending machine keys) on them. My cover has been on the lock ever since I bought it & today it is 87 degrees outside. Still the lock won't allow the key to turn in it. after 10 minutes of working on it with the CTP keys it budged a little, but it still didn't unlock ALL the way.Tomorrow I am going to get my Custom Truck specialist to torch it off. Next time I will buy the MASTERLOCK Brand."
1,STINKS,"I have the Reese. The thing needed to be welded off. I got the masterlock on there now. It has a plastic cover to protect the barrel, and I had no problem. No more emarrasment when you pull up at U-Haul. Get the MASTERLOCK."
1,STUCK,"I didn't buy it on amazon but at Home Depot. I just had a bad enough experience I want to warn others not to buy it. Used it for towing 3 times, on the 3rd time it became stuck. I left it on for a year but now I need it off. Dont recommended this at all."

5,This book is truthful and and full of hope!,If you or someone you love are looking for a way out of homosexualty this rare side of the untold story is for you . This book offers hope and healing in a world where most people are willing to just give up and embrace the homesexual life style. If you think you know all there is on this subject you are about to hear the rest of the story. Thank you Richard Cohen... this book is a blessing to all who dare to read it and to those who are willing to learn more.
1,Dishonest presentation of statistics,"Richard Cohen presents the statistics on homosexuality in a misleading (and methematically unsound) way, leading many people to believe things that are false.One must assume that much more than his statistical analysis has been embellished."
1,"Full of statistics errors, not good as a single resource","This book is full of mathematical errors and errors in statistical analysis (errors that will easily mislead people). As a result one should be careful not to rely solely on this book. One should be careful to consult a psychologist, PFLAG, and other resources that do not mispresent statistics."
1,IGNORANCE ABOUNDS IN THIS BOOK,"If people claim to find this book ""helpful"" I can rest assure you that they were not gay to begin with. This book is written by people with no sense of what it means to be gay, who think they can play god and explain away the human psyche with a load of psycho-babble, and are a bunch of self-righteous ... who need to take a good look at the world - and themselves as misguided people who are conceited enough to claim they can ""fix"" something that doesn't need to be fixed. One day, when society catches up to truth, these authors will be left behind in the dust, and society will be all the better for it. We can only hope that they will never publish such ... again."
1,I need more info,"I am glad that, so unhappy, Cohen found a way out of his unhappiness, but before I can accept this ""therapy"" as a valid approach, it needs to be subjected to all sorts of outside review and independent verification that it can succeed.Just as we shouldn't allow new drug therapies on the market without thorough testing, so, too, shouldn't we allow theories like Cohen's out there--even if with good intentions--until we know for certain that it works. Cohen gives no evidence that it does, and as far as I can find out on the Internet and in the library there is no evidence that this approach to therapy does work.I thus remain skeptical."
1,Ignorance at its best!,I have never read such a pile of nonsence in just one book.Of course you can change your behave and acting as a straight person but that doesn't heal anything.Be what you are and enjoy the life !!
1,Do Unto Others,"What Would Jesus Do?Nothing.This book is about self-hatred and trying to change to fit someone else's view. There is no self acceptance for people who claim to be ex-gays. That is why so many end up ex-ex-gays. This is no different than a black person bleaching their skin. It's wrong. We must love ourselves as God does, just as he made us. God made us all exactly the way he intended us to be: Gay, straight, black, white, insert difference here."
1,Pure Propoganda,"Do NOT be mislead into thinking that this is an objective account of being gay, being straight, or being confused. It is nothing more than absolute propoganda for a specialized version of intolerance. If you are gay, or think you are gay, please do not be fooled by this kind of rhetoric. There are answers to your issues, but this is NOT it."
1,"Misleading, NOT scientific","Despite the fact that this book claims to present a way to come out of homosexuality based on scientific/psychological evidence, I soon discovered that it is completely misleading. For starters, The American Psychological Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in the 1970s. This means that real doctors (not Laura Schlessinger, who is NOT a psychiartrist, psychologist or medical doctor)determined that homosexuality is NOT a disease or medical condition. The so-called science used in this book is either completely out of date or is based on faulty studies."
4,Exposing the Truth,"I have read Richard Cohen's book and found his analysis concerning the lack of validity of the current scientific research on genetics of homosexuality accurate and helpful. He has shared not only his own journey but his therapeutic tools for healing of the deep wounds causing homosexual cravings. Clergy, therapists, and those seeking to make sense of the current homosexual debate should read this book.I highly recommend this book as well as Thomas E. Schmidt's book, Straight and Narrow (Intervarsity Press)."
1,Whack job...,"Richard Cohen is gay. He is trying to unsuccessfully explain something that he doesn't like and is uncomfortable with. Even the photo on the cover is a joke. I've never seen a more posed and uncomfortable looking couple. It's a sad, sad attempt. Give up and be who you are, not what the right wing society says you should be."
1,"Anyone will ""change"" when threatened with ostracism","It is sad that facts and figures put together to pander to the unreasonable fears of the religious right and the lunatic fringe of the pschological community continues to pass as science. The underlying assumtion that Gay and Lesbian people are sick or disordered to begin with is incorrect. Given that this book was researched on the basis of this false premise should lead any educated reader to question the authors motives. It is not simply a question of having a difference of opinion. Cohen is mis-informed about homosexulity. The book was written because the author cannot accept human nature, starting with his own. Perhaps he should return to school and study the contributions of the Gay and Lesbian community today and throughout history."
5,Coming Out Straight,"Remarkably easy reading for such a heavy subject. Extremely informative and helpful to one who is dealing with the issue. And most of all, leaves reader with hope for healing of deep and painful issues."
3,Good NOT Great,"There was a lot of information that was very good, but I had gone through some of the ""holding therapy"", with a therapist several years ago, which is discribed in this book. This type of therapy proved to be extremely damaging to my healing and only solidified distrust in other people. This book is good, but not great. I would recommend this book, but would also recommend an open mind and other reading. I also found that telling of other men's sexual adventures was not congruant with the authors insistance that we not read about other men's sexual behaviors. I wanted more info about how to heal. I felt very confortable with some of the healing processes the book suggested and finally put it down in favor of other readings on the subject."
1,Great Book for Cleaning Up Dog Poop,"For anyone who wants to better understand their sexuality, there are many LGBT organizations, events, and people out there who want to explore with you and support your courage to come out.This book attempts to blind fold your eyes, duck tape your mouth, and shove you back in the closet as Richard Cohen demonstrates with shameful lies and absurdities. God only knows how this man can fall asleep at night."
4,a therapist recommends this,"As a therapist I found this book very helpful. Not only does it explain the multiple factors that are involved in someone becoming homosexual in their orientation, it gives specific goals and therapeutic techniques for therapists to use. It is a loving, concerned, and thoughtful book. It is not afraid to stand up to the current politically correct thinking and point out that the research supports the fact that homosexuals can, and have, changed their behavior, feelings, and even their orientation. While not everyone wants to achieve those ends, those who do can find hope."
1,Horrifyingly naive!,"A shocking and pitiful example of ""therapy,"" Cohen displays neither competence with statistical analysis (in fact he commits blatant mathematical-statistical errors) or with modern psychotherapeutic approaches."
1,THIS IS SUCH BS,"okay anyone who think that they can sure anyone from who they are freaking high!!! this book is stereotyping, belittling, hurtful, slandering, and is pure lies!!!!! no one should ever buy this book and if anyone does for any other reason to report this person for psychiatric assistance or to throw it in the fire is crazy this is written by someone who claims to be the victim of a hate crime for being fired for trying to cure someone of their ""life style choice"". it is all lie he claims that religion, race, divorce, and other things that have absolutely no impact on anyones sexuality and it is completely tragic that anyone has even bought this and i am so disappointed that anyone could ever get something this horrible published it makes me sick and makes me disappointed to be the same species as this fool it is has ABSOLUTELY NO REAL RESULTS WHAT SO EVER!!! people do not buy this book at any cost of your life it is horrible and is prejudice and intolerant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,horrible horrible horrible - not worth a single star,"Mr. Cohen does a huge disservice to homosexuals. His book will do nothing but harm people; people who are suffering because of the bigotry they encounter in their lives. The American Psychological Association recognizes that homosexuals are not sick or in need of healing. In fact, according to the APA, trying to 'heal' homosexuality is detrimental to a person's mental well-being.If the contents of this book weren't enough, Mr. Cohen further proves his anti-gay bias by associating with the likes of Laura Schlessinger, who has been lambasted time and again for the lies and misinformation she spreads about gays.This is a pathetic piece of literature; a total waste of paper. Needless to say, I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Another pathetic publication by ""Dr Laura""... no offense to the real doctors out there","If only there were negative stars to give. This entire ""theory"" on homosexuality is nothing more than a crock of bigotry and prejudice. Listen to the real medical professionals, don't waste money on this book or this author.More than that, focus on something more important than other people's attractions and sexual desires. You must give freedom in order to gain freedom."
5,One of the best Books you can buy on American forms of Christianity!,This book was very enlightening and truly gives you an objective review of the 6 major forms of non-traditional or non-mainstream Christianity that was formed in this country mostly in the 19th century. I do feel that the author should do a revision to this book since some information is dated especially when it comes to info on JW's and Mormons. However the book is very thoroughly research and shows great objectivity when considering each religion. I also believe people research the history of Christianity as a whole before judging any of these groups and their beliefs.I believe no one should join any group unless they understand the basics:- History- Leadership figures- Belief/Teachings- Organizational structure- Biblical accuracy- Plan for salvation
2,disappointed,"Because the author approaches his review from a Church of Christ/Disciples of Christ (Restoration) perspective, I don't think he is in the least objective.I was disappointed with the book. I was hoping for a review from a Reformed perspective."
1,Blinking problem,"I bought one these to replace a dimming lamp in my 50"" Samsung DLP. I installed the lamp and after a few hours I started to notice a weird flickering in the picture. After a few more hours it got worse so I removed the lamp, reinstalled the old one and sent it back to Amazon for exchange. I got the replacement a few days later and installed it right away. Within a few minutes I noticed the same flicker as the previous one. So this time I boxed it up and sent it back for a refund. Between my experience, and the other review, all I can guess is that Amazon got a bad batch."
1,Failed after four months,"Thought I was pretty smart saving $35 over the Samsung replacement lamp, but this one worked fine for about four months then began blinking off every time the TV changed from a show to a commercial, from a commercial to a show, or from one commercial to another. And wouldn't you know it? Warranty is only three months. Guess I wasn't so smart."
3,Sparky,"Everything seemed good when the package arrived. The item was packaged fine and the housing was well constructed. After installing the lamp the screen shut off in less than a minute and got progressively worse. I then thought there was another problem with my TV. Upon removing the lamp cover and overriding the safety switch I turned the unit on, then saw sparks from the end of the lamp where the wire was connected. Inspecting it closer and looking at the old bulb I noticed it wasn't the connection but the very end of the bulb had a small wire exposed. So instead of sending it back in I soldered the wire to the housing and reinstalled the lamp has been working fine ever since. I'd recommend you send it back if this happens to you unless your into electrical repair."
2,No Big Deal,"I ordered this book and Psychology of Call Reluctance. No comparison. This book is all puff. The other one hit me hard, but it worked."
3,"It's alright, but not the greatest value","It's okay. The cats like it. It's relatively well built. However, the boxes are not fully lined--they have carpet only on the back wall for appearences. The construction of the middle segment, sitting unevenly on three legs over the bottom cubby, means that it wobbles due to the imbalance here. Shimming helped a little with an irregularity in one leg, but the problem is structural--the box projects far over it's supports.It's better than most of what you would find in box box stores, but I wouldn't recommend it over better constructed houses in a similar price range from independent companies like playtimeworkshop."
4,"Thorough, but bring along a city guide, too","I brought the Let's Go Italy book with me when I visited Rome in October 1999. While the guide thoroughly covers all of Italy, it doesn't do justice to a city like Rome. (Nor should it be expected to... that's what Let's Go Rome is for!) If you're planning to focus on cities like Florence, Venice or Rome, make sure you bring along a guide specific to the city if you're going to be spending more than a few days there. The wealth of information contained in these specialized city guides makes it worth the extra cost. If you're planning to see many cities on your trip to Italy, and only have a day or two in each one, this might be the best guide for you. Either way, the Let's Go series is excellent!"
5,A Great Davis Set,"I am happy with this set of Davis classics. Her very early career and campier films don't interest me as much as having good meat and potatoes BD Classics. It seems everyone has their favorites which Warners keeps missing, so here are mine:The Corn is Green (so much better than Hepburn)Catered Affair (what a great film with young Debbie Reynolds)Beyond the Forest (Camp, yes, but great camp!)A Stolen Life (2 Bettes for the price of one)The Virgin Queen (gaudy color and this is the one she shaved her head to do!)June Bride (sexist ending, I wonder why Bette did it?)Now if only someone would light a fire under Warners to get these sets out in a timely fashion. By the by, I would have added the Bride Came COD, another personal favorite, but it is available as a single."
1,Beware...Did not hold up poor quality!!,"I purchased this soft sleeper 6.5 queen mattress pad back in Oct. 2007. Nine months later this pad is total junk! It did not hold up at all, very uncomfortable, and bottomed out (meaning it leaves an indentation where you sleep & the part where you sleep usually has no support anymore)! Beware of buying this because it will NOT even last a full year! The seller misrepresents the density of this foam (having people think it is 6.5) it's not! This pad is approx. 2 lb density (I figured it out). Also it is stated as being 3"", it is only 2 1/2"" another misrepresentation! Can I say JUNK!!! Beware, spend your money on a better pad & make sure you purchase at least a 4 lb density NOT like this mattress pad. This is a total waste of your money! Didn't even get a yrs. use out of this!!"
4,Sleeping soundly,It took me about a week to get used to the memory foam and was starting to regret my purchase as my husband was raving how well he was sleeping and that he no longer hurt in the morning. After a brief adjustment I am extremely pleased with this product. It is so comfortable and the way the foam adjusts to the contours of your body makes it a perfect fit every time you settle in for some sleep. The only dislike (which is trivial) is that the memory foam seems to hold body heat which can very warm at night. Overall this is a wonderful product.
5,Love it!,"I don't know how I managed so long without one of these pads on my bed. It's so comfortable, it amlost feels like a real Tempur-pedic bed! I love the thickness of the pad and it has held up well for my husband and I since we bought it a few months ago. I took it right out of the box and put it on my bed, I didn't notice any chemical smell. It rebounds nicely, no more dents where our bodies rest. The quality of the pad is very nice and I was happy that it arrived quickly. Not too hard, not too soft. Overall I'm very happy with my choice!"
5,Coleman 8' Extention,Excellent hose for connecting to a propane tree or extending the length of another hose. It works very nicely to connect items to a large propane tank while camping in cold weather. Well worth the price for the comfort received from use.
1,If Dr. Seuss sold Credit Default swaps,"My favourite (excised in this printing for some reason):Then the De-Regulators all got on the phoneAnd they De-Regulated each Savings and LoanThey returned every one to its free-market stateAnd the Big Wealth Producers said, ""This is all great!The doors are wide open! The money keeps flowing!Here's our I.O.U. for all the assets we're owing!""Then they took bags of cash to their mansions afar.Thus the suckers got suckered -- 'cause that's what they are."
4,Don't think it's meant to be just a children's book,"Interesting book. Agree with the Editorial Review that the book is good on one level for younger kids (great book to play ""I Spy"" with, but leave the bedside tutorials on the message out) while having a position, albeit biased, for the older set to enjoy. I tend to agree with the views presented, but feel that the government is but a component to what ails us today. Thought the rhyming sequence was excellent, Dr. Suess on really strong coffee. Good quality, hardcover, not cheap paper, should last. Bought it on a whim, not sorry I did."
5,"A must have for any parent who values ""Liberty"".","Wow! I LOVE this book! I bought several copies for my childrens' school. This book explains what our forefathers were looking for when they left the taxation of Europe and proclaimed, ""Give me Liberty, or give me death."" Every American child must understand this concept and strive to protect it....because freedom is not free. This book conveys the very important concept of ""liberty"" in a way that any child can understand. (And they will DEFINITELY still be able to share their toys!)"
4,"A real ""feel-good"" for women","A beautifully written book about women coping and living their lives after their husbands have gone (well, one is still alive but with Alzheimer's). This book is encouraging and heart-warming - It really draws you in. I highly recommend it."
4,Three Strong Women from Texas,"One woman has a husband with Alzheimer's. Another has readjusted after divorce from a selfish husband. The third is a widow who breaks her hip.In their weekly three-handed bridge games they give each other understanding and encouragement, each embodying in herself the different principles and strong character traits that help them cope with the problems many older aged women face: social isolation as single women, fianacial distress, maintaining independence and the on-going need to find meaning in their lives.This is not just a dull story about blue haired women playing cards. In realistic terms they are menaced as well by criminals and thugs. They manage to overcome even an armed robber and a psychotic stalker.The regional flavor of modern Texas is vigorously depicted along with trail riding horses and larialts flying.This book is a must read for women of a certain age and others who look for dignity and strength while coping with trouble and sorrow. Bravo!"
3,Hmmmm....,"This book was a surprise to me given that Susan May Warren wrote it. Typically, I really love the characters she writes and can't wait for the next book to be published. This book though had me scratching my head thinking, ""What happened?"" The plot was great and most the time I really got into the book, but what drove me crazy was the wishy-washy attitude of the two main characters, Anne & Noah. I finally gave up counting about the 5th time they had a miscommunication meltdown and their relationship was off again... and this is within weeks of meeting each other in Deep Haven! It didn't make Anne & Noah' budding relationship credible to me... I don't know too many people that could withstand that wishy-washy stuff so early in a relationship - it's usually a sign to bale while the getting is good.Overall, I suggest you read this book in keeping with the series. Hopefully, you like it and it won't bother you like it did me. The other two books in the series are very good."
5,A SWEET SPIRITUAL STORY OF TRUE LOVE,"WOW!!! I loved Susan May Warren's first DEEP HAVEN,1 HAPPILY EVER AFTER but now? the second of the series DEEP HAVEN,2? TYING THE KNOT? These characters are just as sweet and intriguing. I can't wait for DEEP HAVEN,3 to come out! How do you do it, Ms. Warren? Noah Standing Bear and Anne Lundstrom don't seem to have a prayer of making it over so many obstacles in their way but can they do it? I was almost sure not so! But? Maybe my Faith is not big enough.... Can theirs be? As well as the influence God plays in this romantic novel? Read it so you will find the joy and happiness Ms. Warren brings into our hearts and makes them sing. Thank you Ms. Warren for writing once again a page turner for us! Loved it!"
1,Tying the Knot - disappointment,"This was a very dispointing book. For an author that claims to be religious with a missionary calling, this book was a poorly written text with a trashy theme and negative images.I would not recommend this and will think twice about any other of her books."
5,great,"this speaker was greeat, it has good sound and it fit in my 1972 Charger just like the original i replaced."
2,you get what you pay for,sound quaility is poor at best in one speaker the other is just fine. only pushing sony deck 4 x 25w to it no other amp.
3,The slave the princess and the general,Fantasy action magic and martial arts are the ingredients of the charming Chinese 121 minutes fairy tail directed by Chan. Like all fairy tails includes a romantic love story. The amazing photography of the movie supports perfectly the really fast action. The Promise is a very good and interesting work and becomes a real promise of what we will see in the near future coming out from the Chinese studios. I will give it only three stars because I believe that the scenario is not that strong as it could be. In the fantasy world everything is allowed.
1,"just too much as far as fable, and not such great execution","Usually I like chinese fairy-tale-they-fly-and-stop-daggers-with-their-teeth(whatever) movies, but this one was TOO much. I watched it with bunch of friends and we started dying laughing half way thru. By the end of the movie it was a smart-ass-remark contest on some of the stuff in the movie (swiss-army-fan being one of the most hilarious). Man it was just TOO much. Story makes no sense at all, and use of computer animation was TOO obvious not to add to ridiculousness of the overall experience."
1,Schmaltzy,The guitar picking is minimal and the vocals are saccharine. Probably the worst album I've gotten with Chet Atkin's name on it.
2,Not just instrumental music,Be aware that this recording is full of singing. I mistakenly believed it was mostly just guitar and instrumental music.
4,Thought Provoking,"So far I have found this book to be very interesting as well as thought provoking. Jensen writes in a very charismatic manner about very challenging social, cultural, and enviromental issues."
1,the worst book i had read in my life,hate this book. is horrible and the author is a comunist who is against this country and god. i do not recomend this book.
2,Way too scented,I just bought these and they are way too perfumed. I was almost knocked over when I opened the box. Way too much scent going on. Won't buy again.
2,Highly scented,"These wipes do exactly what they're intended to do. Each wipe is very moist and my cat didn't seem to mind the quasi-bath. However, these wipes are way way way way too strongly scented for my liking. Even if the smell wasn't as strong as it is, I simply don't like the smell at all. I used them several hours ago and both me and my cat still smell like we spent a week in a nursing home. My cat doesn't seem to mind the smell, but I sure do. So if you don't mind smells, these wipes are honestly great... but unfortunately I think mine will be going in the trash."
5,My friends child loves Fred!,The dvd was an excellent condition! This is a crazy silly funny movie and this was an awesome christians gift.
4,Cool,Great movie. It's a lot of fun to watch. Watched it with my niece and she loved it. It came in in great condition. The case wasn't broken and the dvd wasn't damaged.
5,"Wow, A 2nd Review Almost 10 Years Later","I guess there aren't many Pizzicato Five fans left, but their Albums still go for 60bux on here so maybe I'm wrong. This is definitely a good one. It's not as good as Made in USA, or Happy End of the World, but it sounds awesome. It's great to hear Nomiya singing these old songs. I've always wanted to hear her sing Action Painting, and now I am :)"
2,disappointed,"My granddaughter was thrilled to have this journal. However, it was frustrating because the device doesn't consistently recognize pass words.Also disappointed in the space provided in which to write."
1,BROKEN PROMISES,"This diary had so much potential to be good, but it's not. Like other reviewers said, it doesn't recogonize the password much of the time. That was the major complaint for the first 5 hours my neice had it. Then it broke! The latch that kept the door closed wouldn't come out enough to catch, so now it's open constantly (not very secret) and since it opens in tri-fold it's not easy to just stow away when it's open. Go out and get a plain old fashioned reliable lock and key diary. Don't buy this--a child will be disappointed if you do!"
4,Santa scored,"My 8 yr old daughter asked for this for Christmas. Santa obliged. She loves it. Although, she gets very frustrated when it doesn't recognize her voice. It is very senative and if she doesn't pronouce the password exactly (and I mean exactly) the same way as recorded the intruder alert goes off. And the prercorded sayings and noises are somewhat annoying (for Mom at least). I must point out the voice on the prerecordings has a British accent...it sounds like the character 'Daphne' from the TV show Frazier. Overall it's a fun Journal. I gave 4 stars for educational value because anything that gets my daughter practicing her writing is a good thing."
1,Save your time and your child's spirit,Worthless! Doesn't recognize voice; doesn't 'set-up'; buy this only if you enjoy a look of utter frustration and disappointment on your childs face. The starred ratings are checked ONLY because Amazon won't publish unless at least one star per category is selected.
3,OK but...,The diary is okay but there is very little space in it for actual writing. The note pad is really little and will be finished quite soon. The fun of it was really that it has the electronic password.I bought it for a 9 year old a couple of weeks ago and she is a little bored by it already.
3,No Paper Refills!,"My 9 & 5 year olds love their diaries, but given that I cannot find any refill paper, my review has dropped from great to poor! They've had this for 6 months and are out of paper. It won't take regular paper. I'm assuming a new one must be purchased each time they run out?! That is not good."
5,A fun little toy,"My daughter just received this for her sixth birthday, and she's been having great fun with it. It recognizes her whispered password with no problems. I tested it by whispering other random words and phrases, and it does a pretty good job of keeping me out.You have to speak REEEALLY clearly and slowly when setting the date and time, but it wasn't too hard. She really likes this."
2,Voice recognition sucks!,"I bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday....It has a hard time recognizing what she is saying and sometimes refuses to open the journal, even though the password is correct. She had to speak the date a million times before it got it correct! She liked it anyway, for it's novelty factor, but was quite tired by the time she set it up!"
1,Frustrating toy,"My 10 year old daughter had been asking for this toy for quite some time. Despite my reservations, I purchased it for her for Christmas. We spent quite some time trying to just do the set up, which never did work. She became frustrated and put it away. The inside paper pad also became disconnected immediately. I doubt we will see much more of this toy."
1,The voice security it a joke,"Look, this is a toy and I get that but when the toy doesn't do what it's main purpose is (IE: Voice activated security), you have made a poor product. For instance, one of my daughters can record a command but when she tries to open it with that command, it takes many times before it will actually open. Then, even my other daughter, or even me if I make my voice sound high enough, can get it to open just by using the same command.It's a novel concept but it's about as security as your standard diary."
1,HORRIBLE Quality! Doesn't last & is upsetting when it won't work!,"Horrible quality, great concept. My daughter loved the idea of this journal when she got it. It worked for about two weeks before malfuncting. i patiently read the directions for troubleshooting tips to no avail. it never worked again--my daughter was crushed when we had to return it. we opted not to try again with another one due to the numerous negative reviews for similar problems. examples of problems: stops recognizing your voice and won't open. starts to repeat commands when you've already followed its directions etc... (annoying and what a shame)"
5,My daughter loves it,My daughter just loves this password journal. She has begged for one for a couple years and Santa brought her one this year. She was extremely excited when you found the hidden compartment as well.
5,She love it,"I bought this for my granddaughter, who had been asking for this item for a few months. She loves it and has problems with it at all. Where she go's it go's."
2,"cute, but....","this is a very ice size unit for one hamster. it's really cute and the hamster seems to like it. however, the second day the hamster went on the wheel, the wheel started squeaking. it has not stopped squeaking. i don't know how to eliminate this sound. the hamster now doesn't seem to want to use the wheel anymore. i feel bad for him because he really liked it. oh well. i might have gotten a lemon..."
3,Beware of Cats!,"Several times my cat was smart enough to tip it over and try and break it, we had to duct tape it to the table."
4,"Nice, cool looking, and easy to clean cage",I just recently bought this cage for my teddy bear hamster and so far he loves it .-Pros- Easy to clean- Nice design- Easy to Assemble- The tower is great to pet your hamster-Cons- LOUD WHEEL- The water dispenser leaks when the cage is nudge- little bit small for a syrian hamster so be sure to add accessoriesWhat you can do to make the wheel silent!!!- Put tape (on wherever it is making sound)- put baby oil or vegetable oil on where the two parts of the wheel connects.Would recommend this for syrians and medium size dwarf hamster such as winter white and russian.
3,Attractive cage but small,"This cage is attractive and on the higher end of quality when considering rodent cages. Other pluses are a nice wheel that is appealing to the mice, and easy to remove and clean. The cage itself is easy to clean and reassemble. However, it is small and there is very limited space to add toys. The ventilation is poor with only a couple areas that are vented with tiny openings. The tower just slides into a tube and is not fixed, and is not completely stable. The water bottle has a tiny opening and I worry about the mice being able to get a good drink. I think a larger cage with more room for toys and better ventilation would be better for a long-term rodent home."
4,"Mixed reviews, I'm in the middle","So the others on here seem to love or hate this movie.I say watch the first 10 minutes(to establish plot points) and then skip to where they reach the island. With that you have a great movie. As much as I like porn, I think the hardcore and character development is what bogs the film down. If you jump to them arriving at the island this is a good italian style zombie flick with some great imagery. And of course, LAURA!I haven't seen it, but this might be a case where the rated version is the better bet. Too much of a film can be a bad idea. Things are often cut for a reason."
1,"Horror? More like ""Horrible""","Well I am a collector of zombie movies and I do own some real stinkers such as Zombie Lake, Revenge of the Dead, to name a few, but boy this one was a huge disappointement. All of the other reviews are true, it is so bad you will find yoursef hitting the chapter skip button. I knew not to expect much going into it, but I didn't think it would be this horrible. If you are looking for zombies, you will not find satisfactions here. There are a few scenes where you see these ultra lame zombie wannabes, very weak. If you get the unrated edition and want it for the porn you will find a lot, but you will find yourself getting tired of it quick. There are so many porn scenes that it seems they were just trying to add them in, made me lose interest in the movie immedeately as it got old. I would not recommend buying this. Buy something else and steer clear off of this one."
2,Softcore Zombie Porn,Italian zombie movies from the 80s all had a tendency to go to extremes. The success of Lucio Fulchi's Zombie (aka Zombi 2 aka Zombie Flesh Eaters)opened the floodgates. Extreme gore was the number one draw of these films. Erotic Nights attempts to add what can only be called softcore porn to the mix. Graphic sex and violence doesn't mix at all. Only worth watching if you're a fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror and familiar with Italian films.
1,Waste of DVD!,"I bought this for my husband who owns just about every single ""zombie"" movie there is. This was a total waste of time and DVD disc material. I should have known by the title that it would be!"
1,silly movie,This movie was cheesy and awful but funny. It had some really gross sex scenes with this guy and he had bumps on his balls. Really great quality though with the filming. It didn't look as old as it is. But yeah it was pretty bad.
4,Laura Gemser fan,Would have given it a '5' except for the video quality. But Laura Gemser shows her assets and that is why I bought this!
1,porn,I can not believe I spent over $20.00 for this piece of trash. What I really can't believe is there are people out there who give this trash more than one star. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Nothing but porn. No horror at all. The zombies are terrible. The make up stinks. And by the way the dead do not make it a porn. Only the living. Don't buy it.
1,a waste of vinyl (at the time),this sounds like Frank Zappa but without Zappa genius. The finest of ingredients still make a rotten cake if the recipe is crap.
4,biggest among low carb bars.,"I used to use those for my on the go breakfast or as snack or as a saver whenever I got hungry especially during my induction phase of Atkins, since they have 3g net carbs only, they taste better than Atkins bars, and they are bigger than them, sometimes I would eat only half the bar and be full for few hours.they taste a little sweeter than I like, but I can take it for the reasons above.I used to buy them from Sam's club, now I have to buy them from somewhere else, other bars of SB taste better than those but they have more sugar and are smaller.."
3,wrong product,"I tried twice to order the item that was pictured on Amazon. I did not want the crispy bars. I wanted the ones that were more like a candy bar and were called South Beach Living Meal replacement bars/ chocolate and peanut butter. They were pictured with the advertisement.... not crispy bars. I complained the first time and they reimbursed me. The second time I went on line and they have taken the photo of the product down. So I guess I can not get the ones I want on line. I found them in Albertsons in Portland, Or about 3 weeks ago so I am sure they are still made. They are less sweet and have a melt in your mouth quality."
3,On the run breakfast.,I love these when I wake up late and need something quick. They are a healthy (which means they don't taste as good as)version of rice crispy treats. A little gritty but pretty good.
1,Disgusting!,"I do a LOT of protein and meal replacement bars, and usually like them just fine. These are GROSS. I could not believe I could not make myself eat them."
1,Looks are deceiving,"I've been wanting to try a bar high in protein for a while and decided on this one. They look delicious and the first taste had me pleasantly surprised, but it all went downhill from there. Chewing on the bar makes it even drier and chalkier. You can taste the peanuts some, but it doesn't taste anything like chocolate. In fact, the ""chocolate"" made it worse I think. If you can choke down the bar without chewing, maybe it's for you. The bad taste just kept adding up and I had to force myself to finish it. Plus, they have quite a bit of sodium compared to some other bars out there. I definitely will not be buying these again and would not recommend them at all."
5,Great Product - Amazon price a little high,"This is a great product. Very good taste, good protein and fiber content. They satify my urge for sweet and crunchy and have been a part of my recent weight loss. And only about 180 calories per bar. I temporarily subscribed from Amazon, but found a much better deal at Sam's Club. They have an 18-pack of assorted flavors (PB, Choc-PB, and Choco) at Sam's for about $15 or $16 so I buy them there. I don't care for the chocolate as much as the other two flavors, but for the price, I buy the Sam's Club pack now.One caution. There's a lot of similar-looking South Beach products, so make sure you aren't buying Cereal bars or something else by mistake. The packaging looks very similar."
1,MISLEADING about SUGAR,"The actual amount of sugar as listed on the bar is 5g, but on the website is listed as less than 1 gram. I specifically bought these for a (practically) no-sugar regimen, and even 5g is way too much. Misleading product info is frustrating."
2,"Good Background, but Few Details","The book was interesting, but better used as research before the trip than a guide while on the trip. Descriptions of many places were brief, and practical instruction on how to get there nonexistent. The pocket map was very good, but most of the maps within the book not detailed enough to use, and not to scale at all. Several times we walked blocks when according to the map the destination was much closer. A big deal when traveling on a long vacation using only your feet and public transportation, not a car! This book was a good jumping off point, but ultimately not very useful."
4,Traveling Book,"This book was very helpful. The compactness of the book was great, it was easy to carry and stow in the back pack. The information was very acurate. It was a great benefit to have."
2,Only Good as A Supplement to Other Guides,"This is a nice, compact book, but it has no depth. I would recommend saving the $10 and applying it to the price of a more thorough guidebook, although it is fun to look at. I'm guessing that one could Google top ten lists in each of the categories in the book and find the same information."
5,"very succinct must-sees for the first time traveler; let's face it, our time is limited","very succinct must-sees for the first time traveler; let's face it, our time is limited; we need guidance as to what to do, how to enjoy a huge city."
4,Great Compact Guide with Just Enough Info,The Top 10 Guides are really my favorites once on the ground in a new city. The are especially good to carry around because they are so small and the maps that are provided are accurate and easy to use. The guide for Athens was no exception. I read this and paged through it randomly before I left for Greece and felt that I was pretty well prepared once there to navigate around and hit the highlights in a fairly compressed amount of time. DK does a really nice job with these and I'd recommend them to any first time visitor. The books are nicely illustrated with photographs as well.
3,Not that good,This was a little dissappointing. The story was so farfetched that it could not be believed. NOT ONE PERSON RECOGNIZED HIM. I kept on reading hoping it would get better and it didn't
3,a little disappointed,"I was expecting a humorous laugh out loud book like Julia Quinn's books because of the reviews I read. Instead, I felt like ""Mrs. Giggles"" from Singapore--I didn't find the book too humorous at all. The villagers just made me dislike them and feel like Sam was a weakling for not standing up to them. Additionally, I felt the dialog was very superficial. I did not feel like there was enough character development. This is the first Cathy Maxwell that I've read. I bought a few more just to see if they get any better. If the 2nd one I read is like this one, I think I will give up on Cathy Maxwell books. I understand that the author was trying to write a light hearted book, but it just didn't grab my attention. If you want humorous, *good*, historical romances, try Julia Quinn, Suzanne Enoch, Julie Garwood. These authors are able to combine humor and romance with a better flow."
2,Really bad,"Really bad, really, really bad. The only reason I gave it a two is because the hero is pretty hot. That's it."
2,Don't like this cd,I don't think julie andrews is suit for x'mas songs. Her voice is very good but put into x'mas songs it sounded nothing special
4,The arrangements get in the way,Julie Andrews' lovely voice is at times lost in overly complicated musical arrangements that hampered my enjoyment of this CD.
1,VIRUS BEWARE CD Universe Gave My Computer A Virus,"I was so excited to find this classic album on MP3 format. BUT...After downloading, I burned a back-up CD and one for the car. My media player froze up. I tried playing one of the burned CD's on my computer and it started downloading a file. I could not stop the process. Then my computer froze up. My anti virus program was disabled. I uninstalled the anti-virus program and attempted to re-install it, but the download was prevented. My firewall was also turned off and I could not turn it on. I have performed a system restore, but even then I had to force shut down of the computer. We'll see if it fixes the problem, but I am out the $9.99 for the download and 4 hours of time messing with my computer. Plus, I don't dare use the music files."
4,Strategy,"I bought this game for my 8 year old grandson who loves checkers and chess. He loved it. It is not as difficult as chess so everyone in the family could play. It is definitely more challenging to play with 4 players - with 2 players, the game is rather short."
2,not so challenging,We bought this game based on all the great reviews and the fact it is for 2-4 people. My daughter and I often play games alone but sometimes Dad joins so it seemed perfect. I wanted something a step down from Chess. Since you don't capture anyone either to move across the board or to win not much happens. Basically each person moves across the board risk free. Whoever gets all their pieces to the other side first wins. Perhaps this seems more challenging once 3-4 players are involved but still there is never a consequence for placing your piece in a vulnerable place. It just takes longer to get across the board.
4,Electric Elvis,"A great looking BD, great at 1080p, good sound also. These are fairly raw versions of some of Elvis' classic songs, from way back until some of the newer stuff. A lot of great songs are missing and some of the stuff on the BD would not be missed if it had been omitted. Overall, though, a great BD for fans. I would have liked a little more of his ""pop"" material, and a little less of the Impostors, but that is just me."
4,Tour with Elvis in a pink Caddy,"Get this one for the extras -- Elvis and Pete take a tour through Memphis, Helena, Clarksdale and Oxford, hitting all the cool spots: Stax, KFFA, little studios, clothing shops, the Shack-Up Inn. Along the way EC shares his knowledge of great American R&B. Makes you wanna revisit Highway 61."
3,An interesting video of a great tour,"This DVD is pretty good. I saw a show from this tour in St. Louis and it was GREAT! The DVD is not high quality as far as camera views go, and the sound is just ""OK""...passable. But as a remembrance of a great tour is makes the grade. Nice to have just for the cool drums on Mystery Dance. That's mainly why I bought it, so our band could do that version."
3,Nice..but serious mixing board hiss on some tracks...,"I thought it was a corrupt disc, but after the production company sent me another copy I realized there were problems in the same area. Tracks 7-9 have some sort of digital audio hiss. Very annoying to say the least. If you can get over the hiss, the rest of the tracks are fine. I keep wondering why they would release compromised audio like that.."
1,Dead out of the box,I assembled this race set for my son Christmas morning only to find out it won't do anything. Neither car will so much as budge. There is no indication power is getting to the track. The a/c adapter is very light and cheap. The wiring on the track piece that provides power looks like it was soldered out of scraps by a 2nd grader.
1,Lasted 2 weeks,This thermometer did a good job but the little ball on the end that measures the temperature fell off after 2 weeks. Not recommended..........
5,Non-Invasive Temperatures.,"My wife was pregnant a few months ago and we were visiting our HMO pharmacy. She spotted this little non-invasive digital thermometer. She insisted that we get it for taking ""non-invasive"" temperatures of our soon-to-be-born son. We already had a couple thermometers, but I relented. We've now had it about 5 months. We've used it for the baby and for ourselves. In fact, just today I was feeling a little ill and my wife took my temperature three times (98.9 all three times).We've been very satisfied with this little instrument. It's convenient and easy to use. I don't know how accurate it is, but it has always given us consistent readings when used multiple times. I don't really understand the difficulties reported by some of the other reviewers. We have not had any negative experiences and consider it a valuable addition to our medicine cabinet for the whole family. Hopefully, it will last a long time.Gary Peterson"
2,"Low quality - we've had two, both died","These are very convenient and great while they work. But they don't last and are built very cheaply. We've had two, and both lasted under a year. I'd be happy to spend a bit more for a better quality unit."
1,96.3 is not a normal read!!!!! Never knew if had real Fever!,"Bought mine for $30. 2 different Manufacturer listed. 1st Manufacturer's phone line looped and never got to real person. 2nd wouldn't even replace it for me. They just kept telling me that I wasn't cleaning it and that I didn't call soon enough. RRR. It was easy to use one and fairly quick (8 Seconds to read) and I thought it would be great! IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!! It would read like 96.3 as normal temp for my little one! When I bought a new Infrared one (much easier and faster for $40-WORTH IT!!!!) I checked them against each other, it was off by 3 degrees! 3 degrees is highly important when it gets up over 100 on a infant! SO DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! Invest in the most well known infrared Thermometer! You don't need the stress of freaking if you child doesn't run a normal temperature or not believe your thermometer that you bought at a expensive price!"
1,Does Not work,"If you want to gamble with your child's life then this is a great buy. It has misread temps countless timesMy Daughter has febrile seizures and we bought this to eas our minds when she is sleeping, Never reads the same temp twice. Today she was 98.7 . We said screw it took her to the emergency and guess what she was 104....This thing almost killed my daughter :(Not sure if mine is broke but there is no light on this so you can't read it at night. I feel ripped offand I will continue to beat down this brand and company till me dying day.I will now get under the mouth temp readers as I don't trust in the digital guessing game"
1,Complete Junk,Only buy this product if you don't need an accurate temperature. I just tested my daughter who feels burning hot with my brother's thermometer in her armpit at 101.5. This shows 98.4. Unbelievable. Completely unreliable and therefore a worthless product.
1,It's only right if you're lucky,"This thermometer gives the most random readings imaginable. I've been seeing everything from about 96 to 100 (more commonly around 97-98). So when it shows me as having a high temperature, I still don't know what to think. This thermometer is totally useless."
4,"Good thermometer, solid performance, sleeping todder friendly.","This is so easy to use, our otherwise finicky and physical preschooler likes it and even mimics the use of it. Nonintrusive, doesn't upset them, and can even be used when they're asleep. Super, lab type accuracy? Probably not, but it will get you in the ballpark and let you know if you should go to the doc."
1,Does not work,"Had trouble getting this to ""boot up,"" tried changing the batteries and that at first worked. Then dropped it from a height of 2 feet onto a wood floor, the back came off and batteries scattered. After reassembling it it wouldn't work unless I left the back off. Would not register a temperature on my 3-year-old son who I KNOW had a temp (I have six children and I know a fever). Seemed flimsy and poorly put together. I replaced this with the Exergen model and I am very pleased with that one."
3,Cute Book,"Punished it a cute book. My fourth grade students like it because it's short and easy to read. Not a life changing piece of literature, but a cute book."
3,My Destiny!,"This book was a good read. ""Tame"" compared with other books written by Ms. Byrd. This story is about two very attractive people, who did not hit it off at first sight. However, there was Chemistry. After years of being neighbors & avoiding each other; they call a truce of sorts. Destiny & Miles start hanging out; building their friendship (each dealing with their fears & insecurities)taking each other into their confidences/sharing. They build a strong friendship then the next step as lovers."
3,Pretty good book,This book was pretty good. I enjoy a good love story. I would recommend it to those who are fans of this type of novel.
5,This ones a keeper,I remmember reading this book for the first time a couple of years ago and I fell in love with both charcters. Ms byrd is always new and inventive with her ideas and storylines.
5,Great Album - No defect,"The album simply is a great buy for anyone even slightly into the detroit music scene. Just to clear up one issue though there is no problem with the product, anyone with the 'Candy Coloured Blues' unauthorised white stripes documentry will know that the cut short tracks are an interesting experiment in which Jack White asked band members to simply play something bluesey, in an effort to reveal somthing about the detroit bands he was showcasing."
3,could be better,"If you are like me, than you really like the white stripes. When searching for material which reflected the vibe created by the white stripes, I came across this album. This album came highly recommend by other people who had already reviewed it. When I finally got it, I was a little disappointed. Many of the songs on the album are only 30 sec long, so this album has an unfinished quality to it. It was nice though to listen to other bands from the Detroit area."
4,WOW 1998 - ABBA (Father),"Having listened to this track, I became so interested in future releases by Rebecca. Apparently I have a four year old daughter named after Rebecca of the bible who equally likes singing. I have listened to a lot more of her songs especially on TBN and each time I watch her on television, my heart is enriched by her singing."
4,Critical book for studies of honour theory,"This book was immensely important for my studies in the theorectical basis of honour. It was also extremely important as it looks at honour in modern ( as opposed to traditional or 3rd world) societies and as such challenges the notion that honour and honour crimes are a ""cultural hangover"" or ""weed"" of traditional ( and mediterranean/middle eastern) cultures."
4,Enjoy these Drakes cakes,"I recently saw the Drakes at a NYC showcase. The songs were great, the band were all pros and the singer oozed coy sexuality. Definitely a band worth watching out for!"
4,They are still playing the song,"I saw this band at the recent CMJ festival. It was their first New York City performance. They were intent on making an impression. They came off at times like a shoegazer band that occasionally wanted to be as heavy as Nine Inch Nails. When you listen to the records, they take you on a strange journey that is unpredictable. Songs like the mellow ""The Same Mistakes"" is a far cry from the heavy metal of ""Promises, Promises."" Singer Ben Gautrey recalls the vocal stylings of Liam Gallagher, but they probably sound more like The Who than Oasis. Other songs get more into the electronic sounds of the Warp Label and Radiohead's music. This record has already succeeded in the UK. Many indie kids in America follow the British Magazines like dogs to vomit. Whether this more progressive sound will catch on in the States is debatable. People seem pretty happy reliving the Britpop era of 1994-95. The Coopers dare to move on to the next thing."
2,Where is the fire? Where are the flames? This fizzled.,I saw the band life and was anxious to hear their album. I was very dissappointed. There are many unnecessarily long segments with keyboards pointlessly puttering along. The songs are occassionally catchy but that feeling is invariably squashed by awkward stops and starts. The performances lack any passion or grit. They intrigued live; I hope they go back to the studio drawing board.
4,Expensive but it works.,It seems like a lot for an odd piece of steel but it does exactly what its supposed to. I was able to center my bit exactly for a rub collar insert on a Bosch plunge router. I suppose it will come in handy again one day and it will probably never wear out.
1,Way Overrated,"This is one of those films I waited years to see.Unfortunately the film is a terrible letdown.Bad acting,bad sound,bad photography.And no one is likeable.The put upon revolutionaries all act like spoiled whiney brats.They come across more like right wing caricatures of leftists than real leftists..Al Capp couldn't have created them better."
1,Punishment Park,"What is the point of creating a pseudo-documentary about a non-existant place, tribunal and punishment? The film makes no clear case for any side, the hippies want to tear down the United States by bringing blood to the streets and the establishment wants to set these hippies free in the desert to be hunted down by members of the national guard and local police, but not before pointlessly lecturing the hippies as they are tied and gagged before the council.Watching this film made me wonder if Punishment Park was the inspiration for Stephen King's The Running Man."
3,Great Summary!,"A good review of the high points of Spanish history and culture. A quick and engaging read - the type of book you can read a chapter, put down for a day or two and come back to when ready to read more."
1,Huge anti-Catholic bias,"One of the most incredibly anti-Catholic books I have encountered. Anything related to religious history of Spain was mocked and ridiculed by the author. The Jesuits were bad. Way too many priests and nuns in the country and ""not contributing economically"" to Spain. Franco's huge cross memorial was an abomination. The author is clearly a ""progressive"" with an axe to grind with Catholicism as it permeated the book. Read the Cambridge Concise History of Spain instead. The tone is neutral and makes an attempt to discuss both sides of issues and explain complex event without knee-jerk anti-Catholic reactions, like Williams."
2,"Go for Carr's ""Spain: A History"" Instead","This book is a cursory view of Spain's history. It is very easy to read, but I was a little put off when I found a historical inaccuracy in the very first Chapter. Williams suggests that the ancient Iberians ""probably"" crossed from North Africa, when the most accurate and current research (analyzing the metallurgical, agricultural, and linguistic customs of the Iberians) points conclusively to the fact that the Iberians had immigrated from the EAST VIA THE DANUBE VALLEY IN EUROPE. I admire Williams' love of Spain, a country that I adore as well; regardless, historical anomalies get on my nerves. I recommend Raymond Carr's book, Spain: A History instead."
4,It's Not About The Tapas,"The book It's Not About The Tapas, by Polly Evans, used this book as a reference. Evans quotes him, ""Unlike the burgeoning middle classes of other countries, here the young dandies were disinterested in commerce, industry, technology and science -- all the things that were propelling Europe into a new age. Instead, a sense of fatalism and decadence began to creep over the land."" Sounds intreguing."
3,"Okay, but....","The cord is so short, I have a hard time charging my phone in the car. So, even though it is inexpensive, it is lost money. I would not order it again."
2,cheap charger,"This is a low quality made charger, but will do the job. I have only used it a few times so far and no problem. It's difficult to insert it to the lighter as the springs that hold the contacts are rough-- typical type of cheap materials."
4,Wow - My Life is Great,"It was hard to hang out with Ray only because I have way too much discomfort/dysfunction in my life to share sympathy. But, I was surprised to find myself drawn back to his story and kept hoping he would get it together. (A typical divorced woman's perspective.)I've always found Paul's work brilliant and I'm sure now others will feel the same."
1,A Turn Off,"Don't let the editoral review or other reviews fool you. This book is not worth your time. The illustrations attempt to represent real people part of the time, but not always. Much of the genitalia is exaggerated, wrinkled, and very displeasing to the eye. The pictures are actually a huge turn off. My partner and I flipped through this book and found that most of the positions they suggest aren't that creative and the few news ones are only meant for acrobats, I'm sorry but not everyone's bodies can bend in the ways this book wants you to. Additionally, this book isn't very long, only 134 pages and quite a few of those are illustrations depicting artwork in ancient temples and paintings that do not include descriptions. Don't waste your money here, spend your $... on something else!"
2,not very pleasing,"There are some interesting positions, but some are not for humans. As for the Illistations, I'm going to get some Crayolas for it."
1,Secret Sexual Positions,i didn't like it..too artistic..plain pictures wud have been more eye catching in order to perceive the content
1,Sex for acrobats,More (positions) doesn't equal more (passion). I returned my copy for a refund. You will too if you are foolish enough to buy this.
1,This book is terrible!,"Look, straight up. Don't get this Book! It is a joke of a book. This thing is awful. Bad art and all! This thing is terrible! I give this book a ZERO! And I mean that! It will do you absolutely no good! Please save your money!"
1,Outdated,I found this book to be rather outdated. It was not at all what was described. I did not care for it at all.
4,A fine recording from Wynton Marsalis,"Wynton does a good job making Christmas songs into beautiful jazz ballads. I liked ""Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow"", ""Winter Wonderland"", ""Silent Night""{which features Kathleen Battle}, and all the other tracks. Wynton plays beautifully, but he has a lack of creativity in his playing. People like Miles, or Wallace Roney, or Dizzy can at least play with some originality."
2,Crescent City Lost the Merry,"Christmas time and the music is to be a time of happiness, comfort and joy. The music in this CD did not bring about any of these feelings. I found the Jazz numbers to far Left or Right of the main music theme, boring and non-uplifting. A disappointment."
4,This is an exquisite holiday CD,"I picked this one up 5 years ago and have enjoyed it every Christmas since. With the exception of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" (I don't know what he was thinking on that one), all of the songs are exceptionally well-crafted. This is a perfect CD for trimming the tree. Along with A Motown Christmas, A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Jingle Bell Jazz, this is a holiday essential."
5,Essential,It's just not the Christmas season until I've given this disc a listen that year.This is absolute desert island holiday music and it belongs in any Christmas collection.
3,For Jazz Fans Only?,"Personally, I love this compilation. However, I must admit it took a few playings before I got used to it. The unusual arrangements and use of dissonance is not what I was originally expecting for a Christmas CD. This is especially true for Carol of the Bells. My friends who appreciate Jazz, generally like this CD, while those whose tastes run more towards choral arrangements hate it. So, if you're a jazz fan, you got to buy it. If not, you might want to take a pass. I knock down to 3 stars just because of its limited appeal. Otherwise it's a solid 4 and possibly 5."
5,Swept Away,"I loved this ""album"" back when it first came out. Steve Hunter plays very diverse styles in this one album ranging from tropical jazz, to hard rock, with some blues and progressive instumental jazz smattered in between.Steve Hunter played with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Peter Gabriel.This is an excellent collection of songs from a very under rated musician.Mr. Hunter,Thank you for these songs that I associate great memories with back in the late seventies and early eighties."
4,Realllllllllly Good!!! Thanks David Letterman!!,"Ok, so I was watching Letterman, doing some other stuff, not really giving the final segment 100% of my attention, and all of the sudden I noticed the music... and looked up and saw this girl singing her (ample!) tail off! Really good song, I was kinda upset cuz I didn't hear the name of the band, so I listened a bit more attentively, got the name, googled 'em up, and ended up d/l'ing the CD...Anyways, really good music, listen to the samples, I really gotta say, I think they deserve that at least!"
5,Listen Up Now!,"I can't get enough of this CD! When I was flipping through channels one night I came upon the video for ""Standing In The Way Of Control"" and completely went ape shizz over the thing. Every single song on here is kick a**. Full of rock raw power the lead singer Beth can wrap her lungs around anything and does so with a ferocity most bands could only hope to aspire to have. On top of the excellant title track, ""Jealous Girls"", ""Listen Up"" are all excellent takes on rock angst and alterna coolness, and the ballad ""Coal To Diamonds"" shows everyone what real passion can sound like."
3,Great voice-okay music,"I had been hearing the song ""Standing in the Way of Control"" and I loved the singer's voice, so I bought this album. It's not bad but it isn't knock-out either. It has an 80's feel in a raw sort of way. The girl's voice is great and that carries them."
3,Good singer but...,OK so this is one of the big things in the NME at the moment. It is not that bad but also not that great. The singing is really very very good but the music is little mroe than unoriginal derivative new wave. As I write the singer has a lot of potential but the rest is not that great.
4,Beth Ditto=Punk Goddess,"I heard about this band in the most unlikely of ways. The NPR music guy was talking about some noteworthy young artists/bands in the Pacific Northwest, and when he played The Gossip, my ears instantly perked up. In his description of their sound, he mostly talked about Ditto's pipes, and that's the way it should be. Sure, Brace's guitar work is catchy and Hannah's drumming is adept enough--but let's face it, punk ain't the most demanding genre when it comes to instrumentation. It's all about style, verve, attitude, and Beth's got all that plus a whole lot of soul. Her Arkansas roots come out in her sexy delivery that's equal parts blues and grrl punch. I would've liked to hear a few more upbeat songs on this disc--it gets a bit slow towards the end--but Ditto knocks every other singer in this genre flat on their ass, so I'll give 'er a break if she likes to break into soulful crooning every once in a while."
5,There Is Still Great Music Out There And Right Here,This cd by the Gossip is one of those rare ones that you let play all the way through and then start it over again. Very distinct vocals from Beth Ditto and very good music. My personal favorite tracks are the title cut and HOLY WATER.
4,Gossip,"Beth Ditto has one of the strongest voices today, very reminiscent of Janis Joplin. The album is full of suprises."
4,Unique,"This album is the equivalent of what you'd get if you took Janis Joplin & locked her in a recording studio w/ a punk rock guitarist and a dance studio drummer. Excellent. I'll save my 5th star for now because that only goes to albums that withstand the test of time, but definitely a great effort and an enjoyable result."
5,Jamming for Jesus,"Yes, these 3 guys mean it, they practice what they preach.They are hard rocking and wont have it any other way.Each song has a positive message and no leudness or swearing."
1,Worst product I have ever purchased,"I ordered 2 packages of these Gauze rolls to wrap my husband's injured leg and have never been more disappointed in a product. The rolls are thread bare and fell apart as I tried to wrap the gauze around his leg it folded up onto itself to make a thin rope or fell apart. The only good thing was that my husband and I got a good laugh at what a horribly made product this is. If you are thinking of purchasing this go to the clearance bin at Walmart and find some old, weak, cheap thread and wrap it around your injury, you'll get the same result."
3,"One great song, two average ones","Happy Birthday to Me is a great song, The two other songs are average Bright Eyes songs but good songs nonetheless. This is not for sale anywhere except for Ebay. Unless the cover art is of value to you, I would suggest LimeWire for these songs. No one is selling this currently so don't feel bad about downloading for free.I picked up I'm Wide Awake... for $8.99 at Target last year so I definitely don't recommend paying $15+ on Ebay for this 3 song collection."
3,"meh, ok","the cd case was cracked and didn't stay on, but the disk was in good quality so i cant really complain, its possible it was shipping damage who knows, who cares, i got my package and i was happy"
3,get knife that shows you know your implements,"I ordered this along with a number of other knives because I seem to have a knife addiction and had read a number of reviews of this brand which suggested good value for the money. For students on a budget who like to cook or recent grads, this line would probably do an adequate job, probably better than the cheaper line of german knives. However, I'm a firm believer that having a good quality knive in the kitchen saves not only money in the long term (by encouraging you to take pleasure in your cooking), but also can be a tremendous babe magnet. The other knife I ordered is a Shun; described above, it is the most beautiful and functional knife I have ever had, and outperforms my wustoff, henkles, and dare I say it, even my global knives. And it looks amazing in the kitchen, with a gorgeous finish...whereas this pink plastic knife just would make me look like a pansy."
5,Great Knife,"This is a great knife for the cost. The knife can be sharpened, and has a good grip on the handle. It slices with ease. The handle is really damn cute, it has little pictures of a pig, cow, and chicken. It's described to be a meat knife, but I use it for everything. It cuts fruits and vegetables really well. I highly recommend this knife to anyone who is on a budget and is try to get decent equipment for their kitchen."
2,Cheap,"I was expecting a lot more from this knife but this is one case of ""you get what you pay for"". I dont recommend this knife because the feel is cheap. Pay a little more and get a nice knife to chop or cut. I cook a lot so I need something that is comfortable for my hands and this is not it.Try the Rachel Ray Furi East/West Knife. More expensive but worth it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I bought this knive about 6 months ago. When I first started using it it was great. After about 2 weeks it became so dull I had to throw it away. This knife can't be sharpened. I recently bought a better knife that can be sharpened and I am very happy with it.
3,Don't bother.,"I agree with other reviewers, I bought this Manga and it's 2nd Volume for the hinted boyxboy moments and there were little to none in the first volume and was more Shoujo in the way of things. I don't think it was worth what I bought them for because I am a Shonen Ai and Yaoi collector. Get it if you have spare cash, but otherwise don't bother because what other ppl say, it's not really that great at the least the first volume isn't. I mean both boys keep refering to 'love' of girls. And that's not what any Yaoi Fan."
4,Psychics and surrealism,"Legal Drug is excellent. I read a bit of ch. 1 via scanlations, but it gets SO good. The mysteries build in a way that keeps my interest piqued and keeps me turning pages to satisfy my need to know more... more about the characters, their powers, their situations, etc.The story and characters have absolutely nothing to do with drugs... unless you count the fact that the two main characters work at a drugstore-- as in a Rite Aid/Revco/CVS type of convenience store/pharmacy.The main characters have all been drawn together because they have psychic abilities. The psychic pharmacist employs his two stock boys to use their talents to find obscure stuff as side-jobs for bonus pay. These jobs are strange and surreal, but oddly compelling.As far as shonen-ai or yaoi goes-- absolutely Nothing happens between the two main characters in vol. 1 but... let's just say the situation is ripe for it. ;] I'll definately be buying the rest of the series."
4,Imported greatness,"Slade gained more popularity in the States with the song Run Runaway. This album, I believe is the first, version of Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply, which contained that song and many of the same from this one."
5,Casey Combden Rocks!!!,I would love to review this book but I cannot get it from anyone. It looks amazing!!! Help.Datdattrax@hotmail.com
3,The music is great but Don&#65533;t buy it here!,"I like the music but the price here on amazon is ridicoulous and a rip off. $40 for a CD with 8 songs? Crazy?You can get it throught ""www.thedaylights.net"", which is the homepage of the band, unfortunately not including very much, although examples from songs to listen to and a link to ""http://cdbaby.com/cd/daylights"" where you can buy the CD for $12!!!!!! And also there you have five songs of the album to listen to!"
5,It just doesn't get much better,"I had the amazing opportunity to see The Daylights open for OneRepubic. Never before had I been to a concert where the opening band left more of an impression on me than the main act! I'm not saying anything bad about OneRepublic at all, it's just a little hard to follow these guys. Their music is amazing from the harmony to the lyrics. And they are amazing individuals to boot! I'm a fan for LIFE."
5,Excellent worst case scenario- unsettling,"We picked up a copy of this from Foyle's in London, and were interested in how it compares to our USAF energy-environment scenarios. Surprisingly, Doyle does an excellent job at tracing critical vulnerabilities and tipping points, both in infrastructure, decision-making, and geography. This was both an engrossing and well-researched book, whose visuals kept reminding me of scenes from the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Events since he wrote the book make the book's flow a little more than dark fantasy."
3,Didn't work--------at first,"I agree with Mark in the fact that it did not work correctly out of the box. The datapilot software could not find the phone, but the computer with out the software running found it with out any trouble. In order for the software to work correctly I had to update it. Now it works fine, and I like the easy user interface. Over all I would say it is a good product. Be ready to update the software which is a bit of a large file if you do not have high speed internet."
3,Universal but Bluetooth data exchange may be limited by phone,Connects to computer via USB bluetooth adapter and creates a local area network. Should be fairly computer universal (and portable) but the info you can exchange seems very phone specific. Worked for 3 of our 5 phones....
3,"Works, but not easily","This software/hardware works but not without some effort. The documentation seems to reflect either an older or newer release, but certainly not this release. Every thing I tried to do took a lot longer to accomplish than it should and took several false starts. The whole interface needs a lot of rework to bring it into the 20th century. Nothing is intuitive."
3,Bluetooth Kit for cell phone,"This product works fine, however the software that comes with it is a pain to install, and will not work until you install all updates."
2,Wrist is uncomfortable while using this knife.,"I really wanted to like this knife. I read all of the reviews and I loved the design, but it's uncomfortable to use. My wrist felt sore after using it for less than a minute, cutting an apple into quarters. Yes, I know it's a fish knife, but cutting an apple shouldn't have put that much pressure on my wrist. I guess I can save it for cutting tofu or fish, or continue using it as an ornament. It's not an ideal ""all purpose"" knife."
2,the emperor is wearing no clothes!,"I've heard so much hype about the soulful sounds of this awesome group that I went and bought both of their albums. Imagine my surprise when I finally heard this. These guys are like a wedding band! Rachael has a decent voice, but Tina Turner she is NOT! It probably doesn't help that my record collection includes many of the songs they are covering here so I am abundantly aware of the fact that these versions don't stack up. If you want to hear REAL soul music check out the ""Pow City"", ""The Get It"" and ""Downtown Soulsville"" comps on Crypt. If hearing super soulful female singers is your bag check out ""Men Are Like Street Cars"" double CD on MCA - you'll get 46 tracks that make the Detroit Cobras sound like the white bar band they are."
5,Never Mind the C**P from the 70's,"I think I have heard it before that the JAMAICAN MUSIC from the 70's is the best. BLAH< BLAH< BLAH! It's so sad that most people only relate JAMAICAN MUSIC to the OVER-BLOWN natty dread jah-drenched stuff from the middle to late seventies. Early JAMAICAN music is totally killer and as an avid fan of SKA/ROCK STEADY and EARLY REGGAE, I can attest to the fact that anyone who dismisses the early stuff is a total SNOB and has no real love for JAMAICAN MUSIC. Even BOB MARLEY started out with SKA and I'm into that period more than the 70's POT-SMOKIN' drenched period. I know that I may have offended or hurt someone's feelings, but you know what, welcome to the world of criticism. ENJOY THIS MUSIC. PERIOD!"
5,Review of the Epson P-5000,"I really like this product! It has a nice big clear viewing area, has lots of storage capacity and is a pleasure to use. I can't wait to take it on my next vacation to download my memory cards onto!"
3,Buy a laptop,"I'm sure this device does what it's intended to do, but at this price, why not buy a small laptop computer and have a much larger screen plus all the other uses of a computer?"
4,Epson P-5000,"Excellent viewer and downloader of digital images. It was able to display all of my pictures, including my RAW shots (NEF). It is a great piece of equipment if you can afford the price."
4,Save and View on the Road,I went digital last year but never had a true backup mechanism until now. The Epson provides a generous 80GB of space and a decent size LCD to view pics. Still figuring out all the options but generally it's easy to get started. Would recommend it particularly for longer travels / photo ops.
3,Alternative,"Check out the Wolverine drives - they offer higher capacities for less money and work very well. More functionality, too.Wolverine ESP 250 GB Multimedia Storage Player with Built-in 7-in-1 Memory Cards Reader"
1,Beware of vendor,"I am not, as Amazon insists on identifying me for this review, ""Lee Hall, Permanent Student."" But no amount of hitting the EDIT button allows me to change it. So. On to the flawed product. I was introduced to the Epson Multimedia Viewer P-5000 on a recent photo tour in Morocco. It is a nifty gadget. Alas, I ordered from Computer Brain, Inc., via Amazon. I ordered TWO; both were defective on arrival. Neither Computer Brain, Inc. nor Amazon has been helpful in resolving the problem. I await a refund and reimbursement for returning the TWO defective--large blisters on both LCDs--viewers. IF I PURCHASE replacements, I will do so in a store where I can examine the product before paying. BEWARE."
4,Epson Knows How to Please,"I cannot tell you how many times I have been off with my camera, lots of batteries, and I think enough memory, and had to miss some great shots because my cards were full. Not any more. The other great thing is you can check out your shots, zoom in on them to be sure you captured it as well as the cameras' screen said you did, and then save them into a folder to later put onto your computer. No more having my computer filled with the not-so-hot pictures to try and find time to glean out the good ones and exit the bad ones. I do that well before the photo gets near the computer. I can rate them, move them, make a presentation with them, so I am far ahead of schedule by the time I reach my computer. I have a back up battery, but so far I have not had to use it."
2,"bad movie, but some nice moments","Once you get past the dated camp that permeates the movie, it's still pretty bad. The acting is mostly terrible, but I will say that the romance between Matthew and Rod is oddly sweet and the only worthwhile part of the movie. There were a few funny parts as well. Sweet in a b-movie kind of way."
1,Just Bad,"If this film didn't have a gay plot, it would be sitting on the directors coffee table and nowhere else. Why are so many American Gay films unspeakably lousy? This film has terrible acting, writing and directing, avoid it at all costs. If you want to see a good gay film try Urbania or Parting Glances."
5,One of the brightest phenomena in the realm of belcanto,"Born in 1893 in Aragon, Spain, in a humble srurroundings. In his youth he was a shepherd, later he worked in a factory. Finally, his vocal talent was discovered and he was awarded a scholarship to the Barcelona Conservatory.Fleta made his debut in 1919 at the Civic Theater in Trieste. After several years of extremely successful activity in Italy and Spain, he was called upon to join New York's Metropolitan Opera Company where he made his debut in 1922 in the r^le of Cavaradossi. The virtuosity of his voice-control and his superb vocal-technique brought about his recognition as The Lord High Keeper..."
1,Fails After 6 Months,"I've owned two of these and both have failed just after 6 months of use. I've also purchased two tips for my iPod and two different iGo chargers... same story, all fail right after 6 months. The build quality is poor and it appears that these simply are not designed for continual use. I recommend choosing another product line. iGo is marketing cheap parts perhaps with the understanding that you're changing your electronic device often enough to warrant new tips and/or charging sets. If you change your phone or receiving device every six months, then this will suffice. If you're interested in a quality product that will work reliably over time, then this is not a smart choice."
4,Her Soul Speaks Volumes!,"I've been pouring over Soul Speak for weeks and Ms. Torian's writing continues to WOW me! Her words clearly come from the soul; indeed they travel from the poet's soul directly to the reader's soul. This work is truly intellectual, multilayered and yet attainable for every level of appreciation. Ms. Torian's writing evokes memories, mirrors reality and inspires fantasy. A powerful poetic voice of the poetic re-evolution!..."
1,Fitz and Floyd Holiday Musical Christmas Lodge Sleigh,"The music box didn't work, so I had to return it. The product was sold out, so I received a refund."
4,Cortijo y su combo,This is not my normal style of music but I heard a couple of songs from this album on satellite radio and thought it was worth buying. The music is Puero Rican and totally in Spanish but the beat and orchestration is excellent so the language doesn't matter. This group is probably very popular in Puerto Rico and gives distinction to Puerto Rican/Latin flavor of music.
1,Error with kindle edition!,"I bought the mother goose book and it downloaded to my kindle as the Ten bears book. The cover shows mother goose and when I click on it, the Ten bears opens! Just wanted to warn those buying the kindle book. The author appears to have uploaded the wrong content! The sample book looked so cute and I'm really disappointed that it downloaded the wrong content. I'll revise this review once it gets fixed!"
2,read before you buy an item,saw it was the dirty dozen with out reading that it was the 1980's. both movies sucked. It was my fault for not reading
5,A delightful read,"I bought this book before Christmas and enjoyed it thoroughly. It deals with the question of how pulp fiction is dismissed by the literary world as being unworthy of being called literature. Swirski argues very convincingly that some ""lobrow"" genre fiction is indeed worthy of a closer look, and uses several novels as examples to make his case. I really enjoyed reading his arguments as he built his case throughout the book, because they were so clear and each one built on the previous one.The writing is accessible and absorbing even though written by an academic, and would be great for both fans of fine genre fiction as well as for use in university courses."
5,Even an amateur like me can enjoy reading this book.....,"As an amateur of the literature study, I've found this book surprisingly friendly. The author has tried his best to communicate the common factors between pop culture and literature and has been successful in his attempt. Not only did the author provide abundant sources in every chapter, he is also able to elaborate, interpret and present his arguments from a new angle. It's a good read and it should be highly recommended for those people or students who are interested in discovering the connection between literature and pop culture. Overall, this book is a new light shed on the academic world and should be a suggested read for the professionals and the amateurs such as myself and many others."
3,The First Cut Cuts It,"This book was pretty good. You liked characters, you hated characters. It wasn't award-winning material but it was something that you can sit back and enjoy. I'd recommend it."
2,Not up-to-date!,"This book is from 2001 so it is definitely not up-to-date. In one table, it compares 25 different companies that offer payment options on the web but only 4 or so are even around. So I'd be wary about paying $88 for information that may not be too trustworthy. Seems geared more towards academics than professionals."
2,"Academics understand technology, not the business","I believe this book is a good technical study in the bits and bytes of how payment systems work, yet lacks the real-world applications, value propositions, and financial information on why some payment systems work, and many others are complete failures in the real world. Technology is only one segment of the payment arena."
5,excellent book,this book has gathered information about payment system as good as possible.I hope every one that like E_banking technology see this book!
3,slow but ok,"I had to read this book for a school project. It's a good, thorough biography but it is a VERY SLOW READ!!! I wouldn't start reading this unless you had a lot of time on your hands. It took me around a week to read it, and I read pretty fast. The author examines Gandhi's life in depth, with a TON of detail. All in all, it's a great biography, but somewhat boring if you're not interested in what Gandhi was really like."
3,sampson and delilah,Very good although the story was weaker than some of the other Great Adventures from the Bible series.
2,slow,"I had first tried to order a set of these car seats a year ago, and I had trouble getting the seller to ship the items. When I had ordered the items the computer was showing 2 left in stock, and when I had purchased the items, the shipping confirmation had stated that it would take 2 months to ship them to me. After waiting two and a half months I still had not received the items, so I e-mail the seller. I ended up canceling my first order. Then about six months later I still wanted the items, so I tired ordering them again. This time the order went through and they shipped the items. The shipping was kind of slow and when I opened the package the appearance of the items did not look like the picture."
5,"This Book is Excellent, Simple and Clear","I learned more about drawing from this book than I did going to Art school for 2 years. He is an excellent teacher with a very clear perspective of teaching. He makes it all very simple and clear. from reading this book and studying the master drawings in it and understanding what he means, I am already becoming a better artist."
3,Good reference,"Good reference but lacked seeing the anatomy under a variety of light. Would be nice to see, form, rim ,backlight and full light representations."
3,Why is this so rated?,"Couple of great insights (draughtsmen see, above all, the structure (= underlying geometrical forms). The old masters used light/shade (chiaroscusco) in a relative way as best suits the subject - not necessarily consistently, otherwise, well I guess its worth a look if one's got the time - let's say it's good background, rather than essential, reading..."
4,Lessons from the Masters,"Very generic, some nice figure drawing but on the whole not worth the expense."
4,This game is addictive!,"This is a simulator. If you like model trains you should love it. The tracks and trains on the disk are fine and the ones you can order to go with it are great. Almost all of the download able content has problems but most of them work, may have areas showing wireframe but still usable. You can even upload your favorite track for others to use if you so wish. I found myself sitting here ""messing"" with it for eight hours at one sitting so yes it is very addictive."
2,An exercise in tedium,"Due to a most terrible interface and items for your train layout that have inconsistent color saturation, this software is really a pain to use. It is not a game. It is a simulator. For those who cannot afford model railroading, this is the best there is and it sucks. In the end, you spent most of your time wading through the categories looking for a building or tree instead of getting to it quickly and easily to build your model railroad.This software needs an interface overhaul, and it needs it desperately."
2,What? We don't have any American trains that are worth while?,"Sometimes I wonder about games such as this. The designers seem to think that the only routes worth having are European or British. Perhaps if I were European or British I might think so too, but I'm not and I happen to like American routes. What about our great ones? Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. Rock Island. Southern Pacific with their great Sunset and Daylight routes. Baltimore and Ohio. New York Central. All these get short shrift when it comes to railroad sims.I think I just got out of the railroad sim business. No more for me."
1,Waste of Time.,"I bought this game [...] and after a few hours of play time, if it wasn't for the image distortion, and graphic-lag, and the fact that the game itself is basically a hodge-podge collection of freeware/payware train setups (""For the entire route go to ""blahblahblah.com/co.uk/org"" for [...], and the fact that this so-called content is supposed to be FREE (according to the package cover) it might actually be fun.If you set the session to use Dial-control then it literally eliminates any sense of realism because you feel like you're sitting on the floor with a switch in your hand and if you set it to use the actual controls then actually maintaining smooth operation is somewhere between difficult and impossible.This game does NOT perform as advertised and I would not recommend it to anyone. If you're looking for a decent train simulator, I recommend Microsoft Train Simulator program, you should be able to find it here or on the marketplace."
2,"Promises much, delivers little 'right out of the box'.","From product description, I thought I was in for some cool railroading with Trainz2006. In fact, I felt duped. After an initial problem with the product having been shipped with the wrong unlocking key, I eventually got loaded. Performance actually seemed better than I had expected, but this did not strike me as being anything like MS Train Sim. There appear to be lots of upgrades and add-ons, mainly from 3rd parties, and I am left feeling that I have a completely undocumented, incomplete product. I imagine that if I want to sit down for hours designing my own game, then this product would allow me to do that, but I was expecting to be able to do far more 'right out of the box' than I actually can do.Make sure you understand what you are getting before you buy!"
5,welcome to the rehearsal,well well well so the power to the people chant fades too quickly and until the hitler bit at the end with its reggae grove anti nixon no more four years no more nothing this is a strangely apolitical album even if we sat and talked of revolution just like two liberals in the sun is such a great line and of course yoko is yoko perfect if you want to revamp elvis hound dog (whoamp whoamp) so not made in japan it still echoes pre watergate paranoia we are all alone up here so sing along reggae children where is the delux DVD can you say conspiracy theory
4,Good Shemale Fun,"If you're into shemales, then this one is for you. This book is a series of short erotic adventures all taking place at an apartment building populated exclusively by shemales (even the janitor is one). At the end all of the characters come together (not literally) for a game of bingo played in a way I've never seen before. Once that's done, the reader is treated to a gallery of assorted shemales.All the women(?) are attractive, and hardly a page goes by without some kind of sexual activity going on. My only complaint is that only a couple of them are well-hung."
3,Pictures of boys with boobs. meh,"I really wanted more story... This one was so thin, I could hardly tell if the pages were out of order. Still, it's nice drawing."
3,It's Raining Shemales!,"This book covers the erotic goings-on at an apartment building where all the tenants are shemales and clothing appears to be optional. Rather than one long narrative focusing on one character, it plays more like an ensemble piece. It is very good, my one gripe is that with the excpetion of one of them, all the shemales have small members."
2,"Poorly drawn, not sexy",Very disappointed to read this book. The drawing style is overly simple and juvenile and doesn't lend anything to the story- the poor drawing actually makes the characters *less* attractive.Disappointing story as well- girls with guy's parts just isn't interesting to me and the sex was downright boring.
5,One of the best,"This is one of the best western swing compliations. Too bad it isn't on c.d......yet. But if you need a fix in the meantime, I suggest you check out the Bob Wills Tiffany Transcriptions collection. Any of the many that are out there will suffice."
4,great music !,"great music! had it on my boat all summer long, became especially attached to ""wheni put on my long white robe"". they just don't make great music like this anymore.i only wish it was on cd.... 8-)"
5,Real value for money,"I live in Scotland and had been looking for this book for some time. I had to cross the pond to get it and have not been disappointed. It is a comprehensive guide to ""Dressing Em Out"" dealing with many commonly hunted mammals and birds and each species is dealt with individually. The accompanying text is both relevant and informative and gives clear instructions on how to deal with your kill.It includes many useful hunting and survival tips. I was also very pleased with the service offered by the supplier."
2,mundane book with may other great alternatives,I own this book amongst many others and I believe this book to really be a waste of time and money. Look for other books that will help you with your collection. You will not be sorry. I do not recommend this book. Gruhn is a great guy and in person he does great appraisals but this is not that.
4,Much Improved Gruhn's Guide,"This is a vast improvement over the older version of Gruhn's Guide to Vintage Guitars. I would like the next version to include vintage Sunn amps, heads and cabinets, as well."
1,Disappointing,"There are no prices or estimates of value,which is what I needed the book for.The one guitar I bought the book forhad two lines and no picture."
4,Thorough but not completely so.,"I purchased this tome because I have a few older guitars and amps that I wanted to evaluate. The detail is well done and the range of manufacturers is fairly complete, but I have an old Ventura acoustic that was not listed anywhere. That's my only disappointment. Otherwise, this seems to be fairly definitive."
5,THE authoritative guide.,"I am a collector of vintage stringed instruments. I purchased George Gruhn's first volume in 1991, which was called the ""Guide to Vintage Guitars"". As I used it, I found that it corraborated, expanded and corrected the many other sources I use. The 2nd edition is greatly expanded, and now includes ""American Fretted Instruments"". It continues to be the most usable, informative and authoritative guide to vintage stringed instruments I am aware of. This is my ""go to"" guide. All other sources are used for additional detail and corraboration. A must have reference for anyone interested in vintage stringed instruments."
4,An extremely hard game!,"I remember playing this really hard game on my Commodore 64 years and years ago. The graphics were far from sophisticated but it was still quite fun. You would play Sir Arthur, a Knight on a mission to rescue a Princess of some kind from a bunch of monsters. If you touched the bad guys Arthur would jump out of his armor and run about in his g-string and if he touched them again his bones would jump out of his skin.Mark Cooksey's music was the grooviest and coolest thing about it, definitely one of the most memorable tunes on C64 (which, surprisingly, had many cool tunes).Later remade (practically) as Ghouls and Ghosts, which was equally as hard, if not harder as you had to finish it twice to TRULY finish it."
3,Not your Grand Daddy's hat,Bought this hat for reenacting WWII in cold weather. The hat must be a size 6 3/4 because when I put it on the stitching came out and the visor fell out. The WWII originals are not much better but they stretch without falling apart. Beware if your wear a hat larger then a 7.
2,NOT 100% wool,The hats are 100% Acrylic not 100% wool as stated which is a shame. And as stated in the other review the hats are a tad small and don't pull on the rim since they are single stitched.
3,80's Fluff,"I bought this cd for Boogie in your Butt.I am not sure where i heard it but knew i had to have that song in my collection.fun song that is a crack up,give the sample a listen.2 other songs.live stand up fills the rest of this disc."
4,"mathematicians, covert operatives, and intrigue","David Kahn's Seizing the Enigma is a detailed effort to tell the story of how the German naval code was broken. Though that intelligence breakthrough of WWII is widely known, little is known of how complicated the effort was. It required the effort of brilliant mathematicians working the theoretical side and the bravado of British naval and intelligence officers who literally risked their lives to obtain the information and equipment needed to crack the code. Kahn gives a very detailed story and it is at times a bit thick and difficult to follow. This is only because the theory behind the enigma was so complex and a complete history of the saga requires at least some examination of the intriguing, yet, sometimes confusing mathematical concepts. In all, a good read. John Kidd"
5,Excellent book,This is a very technical book but I have had a long time interest in cypher systems. Mr. Kahn did his homework.
3,A touch tedious,"I picked this up thinking I'd love it. I read pretty broadly in military history, but found this book to be tedious as heck. The author seems to really know his stuff....he goes into long descriptions about the innards of the enigma and the code breaking computers used by the allies. Not my cup of tea."
4,HP-Laserjet 4p printer,I order this printer as a replacement unit. My old CAD program which uses HP Laserjet 4P as a plotter for my drawing. I order the printer from Amazon and I have finally received it one month later. I am happy the new replacement printer is working flawlessly in printing my drawings. I am retrieving my previous negative review about the seller because of uncertainty about the shipment. But I am very please it finally arrived and the product is in good condition.
2,Very disappointing!,"Although producing two very good albums, Pilot sounds to have lost the focus in this one. Despite Bairnson and Paton efforts, I had the impression that they ran out of ideas here. The songs are not as great as those from the first album and it's hard to define which direction they tried to follow.In my opinion, ""Do Me Good"" is the only track worth here, but you'll find it in the re-issue of the first album, which is obviously a much better buy.I only recommend this album for those who, like me, are really interested in having the complete discography of the band."
5,Bought a 2nd copy -never want to be without it!,"This album is so awesome for mood enhancing or relaxation. I never want to be without a copy. Bought my first one about 15 years ago and just bought a new one because I'm afraid the original is getting close to being played to death. While other albums come and go in my ""favorites"", Blues fro the Rainforest has remained a favorite the entire time I've owned it."
1,Gave it a chance.,"After reading all of the negative reviews by what seemed to be the same person trying to ""stuff the ballot box"", I decided to give Mr Baxter's book a chance. Take my advice, don't read it. Not that it is inaccurate, (my knowledge of biblical prophecy is limited to the Left Behind Series) it just happens to be extremely boring. There is very little dialog between extremely undeveloped characters and the introduction of new characters continued through the 32nd chapter. (There are a total of 33 chapters in the book.) It reads more like a futuristic history book than captivating fiction.I read a lot of Christian Fiction and there are too many GREAT books out there to be reading books you wished you hadn't. Read the Left Behind Series instead."
1,missed opportunity,"This is actually an excellent record, lying somewhere on a line between Iron Butterfly's Metamorphosis and Edgar Winter Group's We Only Come Out At Night. In other words it's an intelligent, varied, well-played, melodic example of 70's rock. But it sounds like it was remastered off a cassette tape. I have a fairly high end sound system and have really enjoyed the much improved upgrades many CDs have been receiving recently, but this sounds like it was done on the cheap by someone with no ear for music. I also have a CD of Poco's Cantamos, another '70s favourite, on the Wounded Bird label. It sounds terrible too, so I assume the label is at fault. Plus there are no liner notes and no extra tracks. My old, worn vinyl copies of both of these albums sound better than the CDs. If audio quality is a concern I suggest you avoid these CDs and look out for the vinyl."
2,Ramasham Recording,I e-mailed the label a couple years ago and asked them to release this LP on CD. I was very happy to here that they did and purchased it when it became available. I am a big MM fan and this was one of the few post-Hendrix recordings with him on drums. I seen them live in the 70's and they were good. This could have been something real big but the sound production is real bad. I don't remember the LP sounding this bad but it's been a long time since I heard it. I hope another label can do this LP better someday soon and I too have wondered what happen to April Lawton.
3,some PRETTY GOOD stuff here,"RAMATAM WAS A PRETTY GOOD BUT SHORT LIVED (ESPECIALLY IN THIS INCARNATION) ROCK BAND FROM THE EARLY 70'S THAT FEATURED MIKE PINERA FROM IRON BUTTERFLY AND BLUES IMAGE, MITCH MITCHELL FROM THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERICE ON DRUMS, AND LEAD GUITAR WAS PLAYED BY APRIL LAWTON, THE FIRST FEMALE LEAD GUITARIST IN A ROCK BAND THAT I CAN REMEMBER. SHE'S REALLY GOOD. WHISKY HILL, WAYSO, & STRANGE PLACE ARE THE BEST CUTS ON THIS ALBUM. I SAW THEM LIVE A THE ACADEMY OF MUSIC IN NYC WHEN THEY WERE TOURING, AROUND 1973. GOOD SOUNDS FROM THE PAST."
3,I Agree with the reviewer from Omaha!,"Yes, this has Mike Pinera, late of Iron Butterfly, I think, and Mitch Mitchell, the drummer for that guy from Seattle. HO-hum, wee-wee-diddly-SQUEECH! BUT, on ""In April Came The Dawning Of The Red Suns,"" consumate guitarist April Lawton (who had also played ""lead guitar"" on the first Ramatam album) shrunk the band down to a three-piece, herself, keyboardist Tommy Sullivan, and percussionist Jimmy Walker, and made an album that is a true hidden gem of the Seventies. Nothing like this one. Hey, Amazon, please........?"
1,don't buy this,"-Got this for Christmas for my child. Tried to assemble the night of the 22nd, but discovered critical parts missing. Called Spalding the next day, but they were closed for Christmas already (morning of the 23rd). Needless to say my son did not get this Christmas morning. They slow-shipped the missing part after Christmas. I resumed assembly, and have discovered 2 additional missing parts. When I called, the rep said ""you should have taken a parts inventory before assembling."" I said they should do that before shipping. Her response, ""we don't make them, they are shipped from China."" Way to stand behind your product! Finally, after 3 phone calls and 3 shipments of missing parts, I got the thing set up today. I filled the tank with water and it leaks!!!! DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BUY THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT!"
1,Defective product,When i received the product and assembled i realised that the handle bar does not hold in place to keep the hoopat the desired level. no online or other technical support was provided and we r now stuck with this defective product and unable to use.
4,1/100 gundam,this is one of the best types of gundam models you can find on amazon for a resonable price. the 1/100 gundam MG series has enough detail on them so you can have hours of fun trying to paint it and asamble it. If you have a few more bucks in your wallet you can go directly to the perfect grade models but if you want to try your skils for the first time this is one of the top 10 models to do it. look for the danychoo website where you can see a few tutorials on how to give this and other models a professional look.
2,"Beautiful, but disappointing","This knife promises much, but does not deliver. First of all I bought it as a present to my wife. She refused to use it, preferring her ancient rusty beat up family heirloom. The Teflon coating does not clean well and has chipped. The transparent handle now has rust inside it where it can't be cleaned. Not happy!"
5,WOW,I have this knife plus three others--they are fantastic but you can get cut just looking at them--way sharp!!! Do not drink and chop!!!
5,Only knife we use now,"Puchased this due to the popularity here on Amazon. Now it is the only knife in the drawer (and I got plenty) that is used, so now I'm going to throw my others away. It is so sharp and comfortable --it is a pleasure! The first thing I cut with this were two artichoke tops-it was a breeze! I am going to buy all of these knives."
5,Unbelievable value.,"I've had this knife for nearly about a year, purchased at the same time as a name brand chef's knife, which cost 5x more. I've used the Komachi much more often--twice daily, and it has kept its sharp edge much better than the other knife! So I give this 5 stars for function and price. It has become my favorite knife. When it finally goes, I won't hesitate to buy another one."
3,Lightweight Knife,I am a former chef and ordered the knife more out of curiosity. I think the weight of the knife is too light. My small and large chef knives cut through the same things like butter compared to this knife. Its a mediocre knife that actually takes some effort to cut through simple vegetables. I suggest you take the money and put it toward a good quality chef knife.
3,"Great at first, not sure in a few months","Bought it on Amazon loved it, edges were sharp and smooth. Had to be careful or could lose a finger (or at least a part of it!).Things changed within 8-10 months of use (not very heavy use, cook a couple of times a week). Has become increasingly blunt, cannot sharpen it either. This along with its matching meat knife is sitting around waiting for a replacement."
2,This does not hold its edge,"I have had the knife for a month, and now it is simply not sharp. The knife does NOT hold it's edge, and I have used it only on soft vegetables a few times.Acceptable at $19, but hardly high quality."
2,Wish it wasn't peeling,"I love this knife. It is sharp, lightweight, and fun. By far the best knife I own. However, after only three days of use on fruits & vegetables (greens, onions, tomatoes, squash, melon), it the green on the blade has begun to pit & peel. What a disappointed. I am returning this item to Amazon, and I'll continue my search for set of an affordable, quality knives."
3,Strong tastes linger on blade,"My major complaint is that unlike a metal blade, the coating on this knife retains the smell and flavor of strong foods like onion and garlic. Several days after I used the knife to cut garlic, and washed it carefully, I could still taste the garlic on fruit that I cut with the knife. I could also smell the garlic on the blade. This quality makes the blade much less versatile and useful than a regular knife."
5,Beavis & Butthead's Wonderful Life!,"Just in case you've overdosed on good will and holiday cheer, here come Beavis and Butthead to put a little Bahumbug into your life. This is one of B&B's best-- great satire and a heckuva lotta fun. Coach Buzzcut pays Beavis a visit as the Ghost of Christmas past in a futile attempt to straighten out the unruly juvenile deliquent. Best of all, is the play on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in which a guardian angel shows Butthead how great the world would be without him. Yes, it's crude, rude and disgusting -- definitely not for the faint of heart. For the rest of us, however, this is Grade A fun. Ho, Ho, Ho.... Check it out!"
1,Not Functional,"I had high hopes for this product, as I assumed that of all people Rick Steves would know how to make an excellent backpack for people on the go.Sadly, I found this bag to be highly nonfunctional. The design just didn't feel intuitive to me. I'd be out walking around and need to get something out of the back, and it was a struggle every time. Not the kind of backpack that you can simply swing over and quickly access what you need.Also, it's not that comfortable.I'd still try other products from this line."
1,Not appropriate,"This book is not appropriate for young children. The artwork is a strength but the story line and vocabulary are a disapointment and inappropriate for the age range that would be interested in the book. As an early intervention specialist, speech pathologist, parent and grandparent I am disgusted with the book, I am thankful I had the book shipped to me rather than directly to my grandaughter.I will be returning the book and demanding a refund."
1,Horrible,"Don't buy this book. While the art is cute, the story line is not just pointless, but actually horrific. I didn't say anything to my husband about the book and when he read it to my daughter he looked up at me and said: ""What IS this?"" And when he finished, he said, laughingly, ""THAT was a horrible book."" Really. Anyone with an ounce of writing talent could have written something more compelling."
4,"Ex-guitarist of FUSION band ""NOVA""*(from italy)a true virtuoso!Think JIMI HENDRIX+Mahavishnu era Mclaughlin","NOVA-Italian FUSION ala Mahavishnu/HENDRIX.A passionate virtuoso*(les paul+marshall.Played W/Narada Michael Walden*(ex-Mahavishnu Orchestra-mk2-drummer+JEFF BECK,circa ""WIRED"".Current whereaboutsunknown.y the way-M.Waldens'currently touring W/Jeff Beck!Check out Corados' gtr.wk.on Novas'""Vimana""* Classic fusion!!!ps- features:Walden+Percy Jones(BRAND X bassist)Moris Pert(also Brand-x)one of the best all time 70's Fusion Classics.Note:Nova only released 3 lps;were released in the 90s,most now out of print-but-really worth searching out."
3,"Good strategies, but need to consider downside risk also","The strategies in the book are attractive. However, there seems to be a constant underlining theme: ""All the setups will work"". There should be more material on considering the downside risk also. For example, in the strategy that focuses on stock with price less than 5 dollars, the trade example only focuses on the amount of profit a person can get when the stock increases in price. There is very little discussion how to manage the position when the stock price goes down.In summary, use more caution when using the strategies in the book."
5,Excellent Book,"I am experienced in trading stocks and options and am pretty knowledgable in technical analysis. Even with this experience, I thought this book was excellent in that I discovered several strategies that I hadn't thought of."
2,Could of been better without the useless info,"When I saw the hefty price tag of $75 I thought that was a little crazy, but then I realized it was over 300 pages so I thought it might be a lot of great information. I was wrong. I did like a few things in this book so I dont feel like I was ripped off. However, all of the good things to take from this book could have been written in as little as 50 pages. There is a lot of useless information that takes up hundreds of pages. I would have given this book 3 or MAYBE even 4 stars but all of the rambling on and useless info hurts its rating. So yes, there are a couple good things to take away from this book, but not if it costs $75 and is hidden between hundreds of pages of nothing."
2,Not the best book on stocks,"""Covered calls are awesome. Let me show you with with these case studies."" There, I just saved you $60 on this book, go find another one."
1,Book examples are old,"I didn't like this book. First his charts and stock examples are from the dot-com years and back then you could make money buying just about any stock and using just about any stock buying strategy. So the question is are the very high returns he shows due mainly to the irrational exuberance in the stock market back then or not? Secondly, if you're not into technical analysis, stay away from this book. It's mostly a book with lots of technical analysis charts."
5,My favorite Market book so far...,"Mr. Elias' style suits me perfectly. Lots of case studies (with the pictures to follow), a sound reason behind each technique, and and upfront Professor style to the communication. I have not seen the techniques presented in this book in any other publication I have studied. The fundamental items, yes, the way they are strung together, no.This book in coordination with options basics (or books like Options Made Easy) can get you started in no time. Definitely worth the read, just make sure to mark or take notes as you go, because it is STUFFED with great information."
4,Very good book but not for novices.,"One must know how to trade stocks prior to trading options.Trading options is a totally different animal. The information provided can only be applied to a market uptrending. A sudden movement or collapse of the securities held will wipe you out very quickly! One final note: if you open and close more than 4 positions in 5 business days, the SEC classifies you as a ""pattern day trader"". The latter requires a minimum of $25K in cash and securities. Margin account is therefore strongly recommended. Again, use caution and happy trading!"
4,Pretty nice case,"Decent case, could use better interuor. Not quite the old style solid wood they used to make but better than most. More cushioning and a slightly better catch would make it a 5.Fine for what it is but I expected better.Sure beats cheapo plaatic and protects caliper well enough.Don't atack anything heavy on it of course."
3,Not your daddy's machine tool case...,"This review is for Starrett's 950, an 8"" digital caliper case (798,799/8). The box fits well and should properly protect the caliper from accidental damage. It is as described, a nice minimalist box.Back in the day, a wooden case from Starret would have come with the instrument, probably birch, had a glossy clear finish, lined in felt, and had the Starret name displayed in bronze. It would have had brass hinges and locks and it would have had some kind of impact absorbing feet (maybe leather or felt) on the bottom.I'll put some stick-on rubber feet on this box and consider it 'just a box' to protect my caliper. I'll stash it in one of the lower drawers in my toolbox.For what it actually is, it is a bit overpriced."
4,cozy comfy slippers,"I bought two pairs of these and love them, very cozy and look durable, not flimsy like some slippers! They do tend to run a little big."
2,Size was off,"The Mediums would not fit on my foot, the larges were way to big. Seem like a fine slipper but neither size was close to working"
5,A valued contribution to woman's and animal welfare movement,"Rape of the Wild proved to be very informative. I particularly found the etymological explanations wonderfully insightful. The courage taken to invest emotions in an issue/s so often strived to be kept objective and reasoned, is commendable.Whilst the authors do their best to give reference to their claims and theories, I found certain statements to be assuming, biased and stereotypical. I would have appreciated if certain statements were balanced or countered with references, thereby challenging and reaffirming the authors' views.[...]Rape of the Wild is a bold and much needed attempt at defending that discrimination, regardless of form: racisim, sexism, agesim, speciesim, are one and the same and will require a revolution now if it is to cease to perpetuate."
3,Everyone should read this book...,"The bottom line is that this book should be given out at birth to all humans born in the ""industrialized"" world. Very powerful, and eye-opening (to say the least). My only complaint is that it's not the type of book that I was compelled to read again and again (something I look for in a book)."
3,Well-balanced live DVD,"Though a few vocals were strained, Gloria proved why she is the Undisputed Queen of Latin Pop. Her and the band's balance of performing pop hits to ballads to Latin numbers is fantastic. An incredibly even show showcasing the very best of this diva's extensive catalog. Nice visuals and dancers, as well. The new arrangements and vocals were an extra special treat as well. The rhythm continues to get me, even after all these years. Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound Machine = quality!"
2,Great if you are a devoted fan otherwise forget it ...,OK so I am comparing this to the latest Cher DVD when I make the above comment ..... Now there is a concert DVD that was a faboulous presentnation and technically stupendous ...Appart from the actual DVD being a technical diaster ... and as other reviewers noted the concert DVD lacked any other footage besides the concert ... I couldn't believe that they actaully made this DVD in Las Vegas ... what is with that .. They rolling stones taled Vooodoo Lounge in Miami and Gloria Estefan her concert in Las Vegas .... gimme abreak ....The audience was great but certianly subdued and that of course reflected on the concert ... It actually helped make the silk pink flamingos appear cheesy ... and I mean real cheesy!This was OBVIOUSLY a concert made with a limited budget .. limited expectations ...and I would venture to guess limited sales .... sorry ......
1,Wet and leaking!!!,I recommend that you not buy this product through the mail. My three boxes leaked all over the Amazon box. Yuck.
2,Great cleaning but gives me a migraine,"I would give the product for cleaning and shine a 5 if it did not make me severely sick every time I used it. I first started with the Lavendar Vanilla and got a severe migraine or sinus headache almost worthy of an ER visit. So, I switched to these lighter scented ones and still got a migraine/sinus headache which lasts pretty much all day until I take lots of Sudafed and put ice on my face. However, the product is very easy to ease, cleans the floor perfectly and leaves no sticky residue. They are shiny and clean and do smell good. So, if you are not sensitive they are great. I love them but don't want to be suffering the next day after using them. Please make them in unscented. I would use them forever if so."
2,Leaking~~~,"One box of swiffer is damagaed. Can't return it. Because not only the packing box, but also the receipt got too wet...Other than that, swiffer is swiffer."
5,Swiffers,"These amazing swiffers are the best thing to use if you want a shine that does not leave a residue on the polished wood floors or marble. I have my own residential cleaning company and these cloths serve me well, I use get on my hands and knees thus killing my back. Now I use these easy wet cloths apply to the extended handle and clean floors, corners and under furniture items I could have never cleaned under unless I moved the furniture. I was picky about product residue with other cleaners, not with the Wet Swiffers, they dry to an amazing no streak shine within seconds and actually grab the smallest dirt particles that I may have pushed around with my hand on a cloth. What I love the most now is my clients rave how nice the floors look, which make me happier to know the floors are that much cleaner and my back is that much happier as well. Get happy and get Swiffers."
2,Good product but terrible packing,"I like to use the wet wipes, they're good products. I gave only 2 stars because the package wasn't packed well. I received the package this week. All seals of three boxes were broken, lids fell off, and the wipes were everywhere in the package, they were dried up, but the amazon packing box was all soaked wet, and it almost fell apart. What a mess it was!"
3,Yes they really do leak!,"I didn't believe that MY shipment would leak as others had reported. But the Swiffers sure did all over the food items I had ordered for Xmas presents!! Bad packing on Amazon's part. Don't combine food with cleaning products in the same box! Thankfully, Amazon refunded my payment. Good customer service, bad packaging."
2,"Love Product, Don't Buy It From Amazon Though...","I use these wetjet refills all the time and decided to order them from Amazon along with a whole bunch of other stuff since shipping is free. Unfortunately, they were not packed separately from my other items, but were instead thrown into a plastic bag all together. The covers came off the boxes and cleaning solution leaked all over all of my other stuff (including some other grocery items that I ordered). Not only did I not get to use the wet cloths, it was a mess to clean up and an annoyance to pack and ship back. I would buy the product again (I love the citrus scent), but unfortunately not from here."
2,Not T-fal Best,Dissatisfied with items performance ex.Hard to strain out water for the cover gets extremely hot plus stainless steel turned.
5,Hubby enjoyed seeing his grandmother's photo in the book,Bought the book for hubby who is from the area. We found a photo of his grandmother so now the book is a family treasure. He thoroughly enjoyed reading and viewing the photos.

5,Jim Henson's the Storyteller - The Definitive Collection (1997),"I am a HUGE fan of Jim Henson's work. I was quite surprise to find the Story Teller online. Some of his work are difficult to acquire; this is a collectible item. I love it and this will be shown to my future kids to see the great shows in my generation.Thank you,"
5,Great!,"This is a fantastic deal for how many episodes you get! The Greek myths weren't as good as the original and the narrator was a different, less charismatic guy, but I love this product anyways!"
1,Not worth the price,"Since we're talking nine episodes in one disc, I found this more than slightly overpriced. Other sellers offer the definitive collection (13 episodes in two discs) for almost 20 dollars less (!!!!) I feel like a fool for buying this one."
5,Exactally what I ordered.,"I ordered Fim Henson's the Storyteller, and that's exactly what I got. Perfect condition, timely arrival."
5,I just wish there were more!,"This wonderful collection of folk tales is very cleverly produced. John Hurt is fantastic as the storyteller and his cute yet cynical dog provides a bit of comic relief to break the tension in the darkest parts. Yes, there are dark parts and some scary looking (and acting) ""fantasy"" creatures so this is not a series for the real wee ones to watch alone though it is great for elementary age and up to view with the family. I watched the four Greek myths in a separate set and they were equally well done with a different but also wonderful storyteller (Michael Gambon). Part of the magic of the series is the way the storyteller (and his dog) always remain a part of the tales and as a result the viewer gets the true feeling of being told a story by the fire instead of just watching a bunch of actors and puppets on the television screen."
5,A Fantasy Fan's Nostalgic Favorite,"I remember watching ""The Luck Child"" over and over on VHS after recording it from TV when I was young and the series had just been released. As a HUGE fantasy fan it was all I could ask for. Many years later, long after the tape had been lost and DVDs had become the commonplace I had never forgot the joy this series had brought me in my youth and after much research found this DVD. This disc is NOT for the people who are looking for flawless animatronics or modern CGI technology... however, if you want delightful stories of myth and fantasy that are told by a witty storyteller and his ""fearless"" dog by the hearth then buy this today!!"
4,I loved these little short stories as a kid,I loved these little short stories as a kid. I got the DVD for my kids. Jody Bissoon
3,Ok it is complete..but,Ahh OK so it was a major mistake by the person who initialy reviewed this for Amazon.com before the official release. However I have heard from reliable sources that the picture quality of this set is subpar..so I would rent before you buy to see if it is OK to you. And I am surprised they didn't include the Greek Myths in this set as well since they were all shown in the same show.
1,Super Bad,The manufacturer squeezed the entire collection into one disk. So much clarity is lost that it is distracting. Paid big for this so I didn't get my money's worth.
5,Old VHS made new,This is exactly what I was looking for in perect shape and in a current format! I was afraid I might not get it in a DVD since those weren't invented then. Thanks!
5,A JIM HENSON FAN,THESE STORIES ARE WONDERFUL AND DONE SUPERBLY BY JIM HENSONS STUDIO. I WILL WATCH THEM OVER AND OVER.
5,One of the best series based on folklore and myth. A gem,"New copies of the two DVD set are expensive. This used version was in great condition. The Story Teller series, on European folklore (disc 1) then Greek myth (disc 2) is a remarkable achievement for the Henson corporation. I would recommend this without any hesitation...most interpretatons of myth and folklore are whimsical and flippant. These stories are presented with humor and gravity combined, and do not shrink from the darker side of the stories where necessary."
4,Kids should be a little older to watch =),"I bought this item and got it the next day with Prime. Probably not the best thing for kids under 5 to watch, and two reasons to that.. it doesn't seem to catch their interest or attention as much (mine anyway), and the other reason is in the story about the Hedgehog Boy, it made me nervous when my child was watching because he kind of shows his ""backside"" (nude).. you don't really see anything but I didn't like my child seeing a grow mans side view or back view lol However, I myself enjoy the stories. Judge for yourself =) It's still good!"
4,Memories,"I remember watching this show on television when I was a child. I absolutely love the fairy tale section, but am a little apprehensive to show the Greek tales to children. Greek mythology, in itself is a little violent and sexual."
5,Wish I'd seen this as a kid,I got this because my girlfriend remembered these and had enjoyed them when she was younger. But I really couldn't stop watching them. They were very evocative and brought a lot of child like glee to me.
5,The Full Nine Episodes!,"Let me put an end to all the speculation - I've just recieved my copy of this DVD today,watched it from start to finish and it does not contain a single ""Greek Myth"" episode. It's the full nine storyteller episodes starring John Hurt in the title role. All I can say is BUY THIS DVD!!! From great grandparents down to babes in arms, this will appeal to all the family. (Believe me, they don't make 'em like this anymore!!) One last point directed to UK purchasers - this played perfectly well on my British multi-region DVD player, despite the warnings!"
5,Still Incredibly Interesting After All These Years!,"This is one of those things I vividly remember from childhood that I think all children should be exposed to. The fanciful stories aren't all puppy dogs and rainbows, and I think that's very important for kids to learn. No matter what the story was, there was always a positive note at the end to keep kid's imaginations and hopes alive. The creatures are still just as spooky as they were when I was a child, and the stories are still just as breathtaking as they were. The only difference is that now as an adult, I can truly appreciate the vocabulary."
4,Jim Henson Fan.,"Simple yet fun. Great for Jim Henson lovers. This is not like the Dark Crystal, this is not like The Muppet's, and this is not like Labyrinth. It's unique and original. Great show for both kids and adults."
5,Well worth it.,The stories are great - John Hurt is excellent as the Storyteller. I wish there were more than 9 episodes.
5,Fabulous! I am keeping all of Jim Henson's Storyteller DVD's for my grandchildren!,"The series is wonderful, especially with the dog in the each introduction! I love that old stories have been brought to life in such a magical way! Thank you!!!!!"
3,Not a page turner,"I was disappointed. The back cover sounded interesting so I bought the book. The title was somewhat misleading since Meg wasn't looking for a husband at all. She just wanted to be left alone, but Noel insisted on knowing the secret she shared with his late wife. The story dragged. Mary Balogh's novels don't have action either but at least they are interesting. I was so happy at the end because it was finally over!"
5,House of Fatty Koo,"Fatty Koo does what few others have, it spares us of cheaply written hooks,vapid lyrics and overly produced songs that hide the performers' vocal insufficiencies. Relying solely on their raw talent Fatty Koo has released 15 tracks that you don't feel like you've heard a thousand times before. Song content runs the gamut from simple mock operatic chants(House of Fatty Koo) to the truth about where one night stands will lead you,""Lust"". Each track is well developed and has either a touching emotional depth i.e, ""Chills"", a song that makes you want to fall in love or an uplifting pre-club vibe i.e, ""G'on Girl"" whose scintillating beat and driving rhythm rivals that of N.E.R.D's ""She wants to move"". Overall an amazing first of what I hope to be many more records to come."
3,This CD is not all that hot,"Let me start off by saying that I love ""Chills."" That is such a beautiful song. Now that I've said that, the CD overall isn't impressive at all. The vocals are pretty good on most of the songs, but I found the lyrics to be juvenile."
4,I changed my mind about Fatty Koo!!!!,"This CD is hot it has alot of different beats and sounds on every track. They really surprised me because I saw when they where premiering the show on BET and I was not interested at all maybe because the name was kind of too out there so I didn't watch. But after I saw the first video ""Bounce"" I said that was TIGHT and thats when i started to follow the show and i'm glad I did I love the album, anyone who doesn't have it needs to try it out I think it's worth it!!!!! Oh yeah and Gabrielle is HOTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Fatty Who?!?!?!?!,"Wow I can't really believe that people actually like this sorry excuse for a cd. I remember listening to it on the BET website when it first came out and I was really trying to figure out what the heck I was listening to. There might have been like 1 or 2 songs that were remotely listenable. This has got to be one of the worst cds that I have heard in quite some time. Way too many different sounds, way too many singers, and horribly over produced. I liked them singing on the show way better than on this album. This album will flop for sure.....and in months (not even years) people will be like Fatty Who?!?!?!?!...lol, I think they already are."
1,Buttons on the side create - what were they thinking?,"I like this phone for durability BUT I have yet to take this phone out (or put it back) in the hip pouch without pushing the buttons on the side. Now I'm broadcasting b/c I hit the speaker button. Then putting it away or taking it out I hit the buttons a few more times and I turn the ringer off/down/mute whatever and now I miss calls. I have yet to pick up this phone without screwing up settings - The buttons on the side S#@K - what were they thinking - didn't they test button placement b4 production? The store rep said - oh, why don't you just lock yourself out so you can not make changes - well great now I have to unlock the friggin phone b4 I can answer the call or make one - Now I know why the called it the Geez phone - I scream Geez-ous every time I have to use it!"
5,A phone that can be thrown...,"I am not a cell phone addict. I just want it to work, and to put up with rough handling better than the wet Kleenex garbage phones I've had up to now. I typically have gotten about 6 months from a phone before it looks like it owed the Mafia money. This phone is the antidote to that. I've had it since it first came out, and it hasn't got so much as a scratch. You can read all about its specs, but this is the toughest, most dependable phone I've ever had. It's a really high quality item, and when it gets dirty, I just wash it off in the sink. The battery consistently lasts at least 3 days between charges, it has a good camera with lots of storage space, and the greatest thing is that the camera flash becomes a very good flashlight, which has come in handy so many times I lost count. I used to despise cell phones but had to have them. I won't leave the house without this one, and if it ever croaks (which I doubt) I'll get another one just like it."
4,"Good quality bowls, good price","Bowls are good quality -- not super thick or strong, but more than adequate for basic mixing tasks, and the price was hard to beat. I also appreciated the fact that they didn't come with impossible-to-remove stickers like some other metal bowls do."
1,Cheaply made. Arrived dented,"I purchased these bowls because I saw the reviews were good. Well, let me tell you what a disappointment they were! First of all they arrived dented-LARGE dent. Very poor packaging, and the box was soaked through. Then when I tried to return them it took me days to finally have someone call me back with an RA#. Otherwise not returnable. And then they charged me a restocking fee. The company and the product was horrible. Save yourself the agony and buy something else."
5,great pieces,"I got these to replace my glass bowls because they were simply too heavy and had way too many bowls to use it easily out of the cabinet.These are great, though I would love it if there was one a little large too. Otherwise, perfect!"
2,broke in dishwasher!,"The bowls seemed great for cooking, but when we put one in the dishwasher it CRACKED in half. So much for sturdy. Suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Funniest book I've ever read.,"Obviously, giving this book a ""10"" rating may seem a bit much. It's no Madame Bovary, afterall.But this book is tremendously funny. A slice of life from the go-go 80's new york after-hours club/trust-fund scene, Rudnick tosses out stomach-muscle-aching lines sometimes so fast, it's hard to keep up.The one-liners alone are worth the read.I had the pleasure of reading this book on a plane. Reading a book that forces you to laugh out loud in an enclosed public area is bad enough, but when the cover is emblazoned with the title ""Social Disease,"" the stares you get are even more glaring than usual.Very fun. Read it tonight."
3,"Mildly amusing, but what was the point?","Sure, some of the characters were funny, but so overdone there seemed to be little point. A non-realistic bunch of people living fairly futile lives, IMO. Pick it up at a garage sale if you need to fill a couple hours, but don't expect much."
5,quilts,A relley neat book.lots of kool blankets to make.just good....Very reasonable priced material an fat quaters for sale.the only quilt quilting book i buy.
1,Poor Service,"I purchased this subscription for myself and did not receive the first issue. When I called I was told, ""sorry, the first issue is out of stock.You should receive the second magazine in a couple of months."" I have received a total of 2 magazines instead of the four that I am due.Never again will I order this product."
3,John Q - Get your facts straight!,"John Q has vomited his invective-filled, nonsensical ""conservative"" ramblings all over Amazon, handing out 1 star reviews the way most people hand out business cards. What's worse than his insane, grammer-challenged rants is his, shall we say ""creative"" command of the facts. Paramount never threatened to sue Fox over the ending fo X2, and contrary to your insane ramblings, the movie was a tremendous success for them.As to the set being discussed, it's probably better advised for the dedicated Marvel maniac to buy X2 in the X-MEN movie pack, and pick up the Director's Edition of DAREDEVIL, which is far superior to the released version. LXG isn't worth the disc it's burned on, and is probably better left ignored. Though I can't recommend the graphic novel enough."
2,too simple to be really useful,"I bought this mobile pocket projector with watching DVD movie and doing power point in mind. But it doesn't work on DVD movie. It shows the frame but no movie or action shown. I have toshiba Portege M205 Laptop computer (Tablet PC) but even toshiba to toshiba it doesn't work. so don't buy it. at least check before you buy, they claim it is not compatable to some computers. buy others."
4,Very Useful,"On my trips to the Islands, I've found this book to be an excellent source of hotel, B&B, and restaurant recommendations. It is not the best overall guide, but it IS the best source of info for the above items. I've found that by taking this book along with the Lonely Planet (which is the best overall guide but is weak on lodging & restaurants) I have all the info I need to plan & enjoy my vacations to Hawaii.I've used this book for travel to Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island, and have never found any of the reviews to be far off base. Highly recommended!"
3,"Not great, but a good start","Overall a pretty good guide to the islands. However, I did have a few complaints:Some of the places off the beaten path were not well described in terms of directions (and if not for helpful locals, I never would have reached them)Restaurant data was often out of date (restaurant closed or completely redone), and poorer restaurants were sometimes recommended while the better ones were left off.I was able to find a lot of better deals (or found out after the fact about better deals available) than listed in the book.If you know nothing about Hawaii, it's a good bood to have. I will look for a different guide for my next trip."
3,"Not bad, but...","If you buy this guide, don't bother buying Frommer's Hawaii 2006. Most of it is word for word."
2,"nice idea, but story lacking","I was hosting a Halloween party for my daughter's class, and thought that this book sounded like a neat idea to kick it off. I still think the idea of flashlight images for Halloween is fun for kids, but the story told in this book was disappointing. With a well-developed story this book could have been really great."
5,"Planning on buying this, but for the person who wanted more","I am planning on buying this...it looks like fun...there was one reviewer who wanted more like this...I know 2 more BETTER than this appears to be: Mr. Whambamboozle and Spooky Scrapbook...they are a lot of fun...very interactive, pop-ups, smelly things, scary sounds (smells and sounds on Mr. Whambamboozle)....my 3 1/2 year old daughter loves them! Looking for more like them!"
5,Not the Pizzicato Five you're used to,"This is from the early days of their career, before Maki Nomiya became the singer. In fact, a man does the vocals on most of their pre-Maki stuff. If you are expecting anything like the Pizzicato Five of the 90's, you will be shocked when you hear this. At first I didn't care for it too much, but it has really grown on me. It's cheesy loungy pop, as you might expect, although it's not as intentionally kitschy like their later stuff. When I hear it, I picture a Japanese version of Wayne Newton crooning away in some lounge. By Her Majesty's Request is a colorful and interesting CD, but I couldn't listen to it back to back with their later stuff. I consider it a good buy."
4,grandular,"this is good stuff for people who have the money, but i would recomend buying grandular humic acid and mix it with water, then fert tomatos or what ever. you can get 100 times this amount for 10 dollars more. dont fall for fancy labels read about oranic gardening and save your self some money"
2,Sees Behind Trees: Near sighted Natve American,"Sees Behind Trees was written by Michael Dorris, a respected children and adult author. He has written many books including Morning Girl and Cloud Chamber. Sees Behind Trees is about a young, nearsighted, Native American boy who learns to hear things others can't see. He is asked to travel to a speacial place with a tribe elder named Gray Fire. I did not personally enjoy this book because the plot is rather slow and everything happen in the last chapter. I would still recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn about Native American culture."

I would still recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn about Native American culture."
1,Sees Behind Trees: A book You won't want To Read,"Sees Behind Trees is about a young teenager named Walnut (but he only has this name in the first chapter) and at the end of the chapter he earns the name Sees Behind Trees. The plot of this book is how Sees Behind Trees helps the village elder Gray Fire find the mystirious land of water. I myself think that this book is good on some points, but i'd say it's preety boring. The characters actually seem like there really alive, and Dorris made some really good similes and metaphors which go well with the story. What is actually very boring is that the book's storyline goes at a snails pace. Dorris spends to much time in the village, finally leaving when there are four chapters left in the book. The only really intresting chapter in my opinoion is chapter eight. And at the end of the book in chapter nine, Dorris seems to end the book extremly abroubtly in chapter nine."
2,"Sees Behind Trees, a confusing story","Sees Behind Trees by Michael Dorris is a strange book and can get confusing at times. It is about a Native American boy named Walnut, who becomes a man, and recieves a man name, Sees Behind Trees. This is because he has a special talent. He goes on a journey becuase of his unique talent. This journey helps him become strong and brave. I have mixed feelings about this book. It was not the best because it didn't really have a plot. Michael Dorris was very discriptive, but it just didn't have a plot. :-( If you like confusing Native American novels, than go ahead and read it. All together, the book was not good. Overall, I didn't like this book."
1,The Boy With More Than Just Eyes,"This depressing book was published in 1996, so this is a fairly recent book. The genre is magical realism and it is about a young Native American boy named Walnut, who becomes a man named Sees Behind Trees. This book goes over board on poetry so if you're a poet you should read this book. In this book Sees Behind can ""see behind trees"". He uses his other senses more so he could help others who rely just on their sight. I can't tell you any more about the book, for it would give the plot away. This a bad book because people die and there is poetry and the two don't go together. If you do like poetry, and peoole dying, get this book."
4,Sees Behind Trees book review,"In 1996, Sees Behind trees was published by Hyperion. This book was written by Michael Dorris, and is fiction. It is a good book about a boy who becomes a man named, Sees Behind Trees and a friend, Gray Fire, who go on a journey and on the way they encounter misfortune. In the end it is very sad. This book is written from Sees Behind Trees point of veiw. This book has many similes and metaphors and it is very discriptive. I would recommend this book to fourth and fifth graders. If you like to read a lot I might pick another book because this book is only 104 pages long. If you don't like to read as much I would read this book."
1,Sees Behind Trees,"In 1996 Michael Dorris wrote the horrible book Sees Behind Trees. It was published by Hyperion.The main characters in this book are Sees Behind Trees, Checha, Karna, Petew,and Gray Fire. The book is about an ll-year-old boy named Sees Behind Trees. He can see with his ears and hear with eyes. This book is also about him going to find the land of water with Gray Fire. He is nearsighted and he got his name from the test that all boys his age must do. My opinion of the book is that there is too much description and not enough action."
5,beautiful story,"This book was required reading for a college children's lit class and I was incredibly pleased with it. It is an absolutely beautiful story of a young native american boy. The book is written in lovely, lyrical language using incredible imagery. It is a book children can relate to, as it is told in first person by a child and includes all the mixed up feelings of a child, but it also addresses some very deep and meaningful issues that adults will find rather poignent. I was captivated throughout."
4,Sees Behind Trees,"Sees Behind Trees by Michael Dorris is about a young boy named Walnut who becomes a man early on in the book, and spends the rest of the book learning what it means to be a man. Walnut has trouble seeing, but is able to turn this into something good for him. This books is would be great for students in 4th-7th grade. This is a time that students are learning about themselves and who they are supposed to be. This would be a good teaching tool for teachers to show students that they can turn a set-back in to something positive. This is a wonderful book that I would recommend for the middle school classroom."
2,For Someone who Really likes poetry...,"Michael Dorris, well known Native American author, has written another book. This one, published in 1996 by Hyperion, is called Sees Behind Trees, and is about a young Native American boy (who is just becoming a man in the beginning of the book), living somewhere in either the Great Plains or New England. If you like a book with LOTS of poetry, a lot of description, with a dialogue thrown in, then you MIGHT, like this book. The book is basically like many children's stories, except this one slightly overuses the classic plot of ""the main character finally accomplishes something and then something bad happens"". After the main character, Sees Behind Trees, becomes a man, he is asked to go on a long and ""perilous"" road to a ""magical"" and ""beautiful"" place, only to lose his friend there. If you like a book with an O.K. ending, too much poetry and a tiny bit of dialogue, read this book. If you don't like books like that, do not read this book."
1,Sees Behind Trees,"This book is slightly depressing. It's about a boy that has almost no sight and somewhat of a psychic ability to find things. He goes out with an elder named Gray Fire and they walk way far into the forest searching for the land of water until they find it one day. Gray Fire gets lost in the land of water and the boy, named Sees Behind Trees, has to find his way back to his tribe and he finds something the makes him sad. I don't really recommend this book because it is depressing."
1,Problem with screen,"I bought an earlier model of this same TV and a few days over a year the screen developed a horizontal black line right in the middle of the screen. Trying to get Phillips to even respond to me was excruciation pain and of course you know how much they did to take care of the product.. Wanna buy a 17"" LCD widescreen with a black line? I have one sitting about 6 feet from where I am typing this.I am now looking at plasmas, but not at the Phillips line `cause I don't wanna get a hose job on a major purchase if something goes wrong with it."
5,Camping!,"This tent is Awesome! I would definitely recommend this tent to anyone who wants an easy set-up and tear down, lots of room inside, the option to look at the stars while laying in bed, several storage compartments inside and the ability to easily store and transport. This tent is lightweight and offers the ultimate camping experience. This was a great find and an awesome buy!"
4,Great Coleman product,"We bought this tent as an upgrade from our smaller Coleman. Sets up with ease and I had it done in about 1/2 hour by myself. We used it for 4 days without incident. On our last night it poured and in the morning we found a little water on the floor. Enought to wet a tea towel but not enough to wring out.I am not sure I like the screened roof because the heat just blows right out. I found that it I throw somethnig over top the tent to weight down the fly then the heat holds much better. I will be using this tent well into December. We used one side for sleeping and the other for our gear, its great to have this much room while camping."
1,Tent Disaster,"We got this tent to replace a very old and leaky tent since we now have a son who is 3. We wanted to ensure a dry and happy camping experience with him so we selected this tent. I think the nicest thing we can say about this is Amazon expedited its return efficiently.It appears this made-in-china tent did not pass through the waterproofing process. We had 2 hours of very light, almost mist-like rain. All 4 corners leaked and when I entered the tent, water was coming straight through the walls and running to the floor-I honestly have never seen such a poor product and we are disappointed that Coleman quality has sunk so low. We will NOT buy another Coleman tent. My wife now is very reluctant to go camping and my son doesn't understand why camping beds are like sponges..."
4,Love the height of Cabin Tent & easy to set up,I looked all over the internet to find a tent that had high ceilings since I am tall. I also wanted a tent that was easy to set up. I am not disappointed at all and would buy the same tent again. It takes around 20-30 minutes to set up and very easy step by step instructions. The Coleman has a very good warranty. Amazon offers at the best price because I spent alot of time on computer comparing prices.
4,Great Tent!,"I love my new Coleman tent. I have always had Coleman tents and was looking forward to using this new cabin tent, as I bought it during the winter and this past weekend was our first time using it. It went up easy and kept us completely dry during a massive rain & wind storm. I love all the openness of the tent, lots of windows, doors, and the ceiling also. The only thing was that it said it only takes 3 poles, which is true in a round-about way...the three poles that are used to put up the tent each consist of three poles before you can use them to put up the tent...so really there are more than three poles."
5,A thorough tour-de-force from a leader in natural medicine,"Dr. Pizzorno, president and founder of Seattle's Bastyr College, has assembled a massive amount of information into a understandable ""7 systems"" approach to health. If books on alternative medicine seemed to strike you as unsubstantiated, this book could change your mind. Extensively referenced and well organize"
3,This book is a mess!,"I can't imagine how this book ever made to the printing stage! How could the editors have failed to notice that references to page numbers throughout the book and the entire index are innaccurate? Also, the organization of the book leaves much to be desired. I used the Paris guide on a trip to that city and found it useful, well organized and mostly accurate. Both are certainly interesting reading, but the London guide desperately needs a new copyeditor!"
4,Pros outweight the cons.,"Although this book may not always be helpful when you are preparing your trip, it served me pretty well once I was already there. An easily accesible tube map is a plus. The street maps may not always be clearly labeled, but they are sufficient to allow someone with a decent sense of direction to get from point A to point B. The listing of attractions is reasonably complete and accurate. However, the list of lodgings is not. An exhaustive list is certainly impossible to publish in any guide book. However, this book lists only a handful of hotels in each neighborhood. Your best bet finding a place to stay is probably to consult another travel book at a library, or to browse for one on the internet. All in all, though, I was satified with this book and will consider buying others from this series when I travel in the future."
2,not worth you money,If your looking for a violent high action movie you have come to the wrong place. This movie is long and boring. It doesn't even follow the games story line it just keeps the crystal Idea and the characters are the same. I would only recommend this movie if your a hard core Final Fantasy fan and want to find out for you self. And what is with the featherless choco?
3,Duhh!,The movie was nowhere near as cool as the game. The game Got you involved in ways that nothing else could and the movie didn't do that for me.
3,It all depends on who you are.,"Let's just put it this way:I eas expecting more from this movie. To begin with, the animation reminds me of old Japanese Animations I've seen in the past. It pretty much avoids swearing and blood and gore(with a few exceptions in some scenes with monsters being killed and blood and parts flying all over the place). Overall, it would be a 3, which is acceptable, on my scale. It would be a better idea to rent it than to buy it... But, if you are an anime fan, and like the Final Fantasy series, it is worth the money.And another thing(not a bad thing, but just a compliment):Prettz's voice kind of reminds me of Tenchi..."
2,"Let's slap the name ""Final Fantasy"" on it and hope it sells!","Oh, no. Oh, dear God, no. Where can I begin with how bad this movie is?For one thing, I hope you love pantie shots, because there are a *ton*.Then there's some guy who looks like the lovechild of Jay Leno, Adlebert Steiner, and Ivo Robotnik (if such a thing were possible) who falls in love with the leader of a band of lesbian air pirates... No, I'm not kidding about that.They can't even decide if the main character's name is Prettz or Pritz (it's spelled both ways in the prologue to each ""episode"").Last but not least, they take a creature that's part plucked chicken and part Jell-o mold and try to pass it off as a Chocobo.Do not watch this movie. Do not let your worst enemy see this movie. Do not let your dog watch this movie. Do not even let your favorite pencil watch this movie... or even your least favorite pencil. Just run, curse you! Run for the hills! Save yourself!"
1,Supremely Cheesy,"This series was not at all what I expected. The plot, although mediocre, was certainly lost on all the really bad cheesy parts. If you want to buy this because you think it's like the original FF series on Video Games, don't waste your time. I found this series very humorous, though, but only because it was really cheaply done. I hate to sound like a critic or a Final Fantasy ""purist"", but the mangled plot, shallow characters, and the horrible music make this an unsuitable viewing for anyone who doesn't want to make fun of it."
3,"Not Spectacular, But Enjoyable","The words Final Fantasy and weird go together like PB and J. This entry from the franchise is no different. This is very old. Also only available only on VHS. To be honest I watched this on Youtube. Several posters have this available.Story: Heroes are out to retrieve some crystals that have been stolen.Characters: Guy with sword so long he couldn't possible in reality do anything with it, Check. Huge guy with guns, Check. Woman who is sultry and teases you with cleavage shots, check. Villan who is grotesque and becomes a monster at the end, check.Is this the best movie you have ever seen, no. Worth seeing if you are an Anime fan and like dark weird stuff, yes.I personally may buy this on VHS from the Amazon Marketplace soon...-Hope this helps."
5,Hot Tools-Great Product,"I am extremely pleased with this product! It shipped very quickly, and the product is top-notch! Great quality! I have a lot of trouble finding these 3/8 inch curling irons in stores & so it is awesome to be able to find them online & have it be such a sturdy, quality product! Even shipped with extra springs & that is ALWAYS the part that goes out on curling irons for me!"
4,Perfect,"Exactly what I was looking for. I actually had a wand and while it got the job done ""the wand"" it didn't replicate my natural 3c curls as well. After 10yrs of straightening, one side's wavy and one side stayed natural, so I needed the help when I don't feel like straightening and wanted my ""natural"" look back. This did it!!! Only wish it were as long as the wand, then I would've given 5 stars."
1,defective handle,"The first one received had a defective sticky handle, so I returned it at my own expense for a replacement. The second one was also the same, so I returned it for a refund; they supplied a free shipping label this time. In the interim, I ordered and got one that was good from a different company. I could tell right away that this one had newer packaging, so perhaps the 2 I got through Amazon/Bple were old ones that had deteriorated over time."
3,Burns hair,"I have used this product only twice so far on a low setting, it seems to burn the ends of my hair each time that I have used it. I have very fine hair, so I would not recommend it to someone with fine hair."
3,this curl iron is ok to use,I like this one but it don;t curl my whole hair as good. I recommened people to try it out before buying it your self
3,it's ok '_',"well the curling iron is small but not as small as it looks in the pic and i wanted really tiny spiral curls but the good thing about this iron is that it has a temperature setting and it has a really good swivel cord that never tangles and twist. now the bad thing about this iron is that the grip where you hold your hair to create spiral curls is loose, my hair kept slipping from it and i had to add more hair to make a bigger curl then i wanted so its not really good for making small spiral curls which is the only reason i brought itoverall i give it 3.25%"
4,good but not great,"This is a good curling iron; I have used this brand for many years. It would have been rated great except that the spring does occasionally pop out (after the warranty expires)and contrary to what the description says it is not easy to replace. You cannot get fingers or tools in the opening to do the job. It is not worth the money to get it repaired professionally. However, I still buy this product as it really does the job. It usually sells for #36 in beauty supply stores in my area so you save a lot buying on-line. It is worth it in the long run. I haven't found any other product that works as well as Hot Tools. Just be aware of the spring problem."
3,Better episode recaps would have been nice.,"I was hoping for more in terms of episode recaps. Each show has a one line synopsis (sometimes as short as two words) such as ""J.R. is shot."" Otherwise, the book has plenty of behind the scenes info."
4,25 Years of DALLAS,"This is both an indespensible reference guide for the DALLAS devotee, and an absorbing account of the rise and decline of a pop culture phenomenon."
3,Diasppointingly INCOMPLETE,"Having read genre books covering other television classics (""I Love Lucy"", ""Hawaii 5-O"", ""The Outer Limits"", ""Gunsmoke"", ""Lost in Space"", ""Night Gallery"", and ""The Twilight Zone""), I purchased ""25 Years of Dallas"", thinking that it would be as concise and picture-filled as other books of this type.Unfortunately, while Curran's does offer some interesting trivia, it inadequately summarizes each episode, has few photographs of the cast, and provides little on the contributions of the crew that was essential, along with the actors, to the show's longevity.While the text does detail some of the guests and featured performers, more could have been spent on the principals and their lives after the show's demise."
1,Oh dear,"Podestá recaps his hits with Miguel Caló and Carlos Di Sarli in a schmaltzy, nightclub style. This is undanceable, and the heavily filtered lp transfer makes Podestá sound as if he were singing through a handkerchief. Dreadful."
3,Pas Mal,"I found Ann Benson's novel The Burning Road rather predictable and poorly written. Throughout the entire novel the dialogue was such that it was hard to believe that the characters were saying such stupid things, it was all very choppy and not natural at all. Also, the transitions between the different time periods were extremely annoying. I found myself considering actually reading through all the chapters of one time period and then going back and reading the others, so as to avoid the disruptions. However, I enjoyed the plot and, despite a few mistakes on Ms. Benson's part, the time periods were written convincingly enough to be enjoyable. The book was entertaining, and when the characters weren't speaking, they were well written. So, read this novel if you are willing to put up with a few inconveniences to enjoy the overall decent book."
3,If you liked Plague Tales you'll love this one,"and if you hated Plague Tales you'll hate this one too. Ann still writes plodding dialogue, and her characters do bone-head things, but I loved the story. I sat down to read it and didn't get out of my chair till I was finished. Ann tells the stories leap frog style again, which keeps everything hopping along nicely.I wish the supernatural business had been better clarified or eliminated. Give us a solid druid or leave the mystery wind and helpers out.A few loose ends hint towards a third novel in the works: what exactly is so different about Kristina anyway? And does that mutant bug in the ""safe house"" mutate further?I do hope that in the third novel, if there is to be one, Ms. Benson polishes her dialogue and characters, otherwise there is great potential for this intriguing series to deteriorate into grocery story novels.I would recommend this book as a good read, but not necessairly a well-written one."
2,I hate it when they do this. It's a serial! And they don't tell you.,"Will Janine have a normal baby? What is Katrina's secret? Will Bruce demand entrance into the compound? And what of Alehandro? Will he raise Kate's son in the Jewish Faith? Will he marry the wet nurse? And what will happen to Kate.Tune in in five years or so to find out the thrilling conclusion to The Plague Tales and Burning Road.This is total BS! The reader is left hanging, dissatisfied, having just read the last page and nothing is resolved. We are forced to wait for her to write her next book. Well, I'm getting older. I might not be around by then. So, keep writing Ms. Benson, but you're not writing for me any longer.I'll buy books from writers who are honest about their craft and don't just write part of a book thinking I will be sooooo interested I will just have to also buy the next one."
2,Poor Example of Historical/ Speculative Fiction,"This is book (along with its predecessor, ""Plague Tales,"" is very poorly researched with numerous errors in the historical sections. The characters fail to come alive and the two plot lines really don't work all that well together. It did keep me skimming the pages to see how things turned out. However, anyone who wants to read a great example of this genre (and, with an identical theme) should read Connie Willis' ""Doomsday Book,"" a 5-star book if ever there was one."
3,"Keeps you reading, but it could be better...","The book is good, keeps you reading and interested in what is going to happend, but if you read the first one you'll find too many references to ""The Plague Tales"". I thought this was anoying sometimes... (maybe I was too impatient).And be prepared to buy a third one, because the story is not concluded... too many things to be worried about.I certainly would buy a third part, but I would be dissapointed if it does not contains some conclussions and less references."
4,"A good book, but...","Really just agreeing with others that (1) it would be difficult to read this book without having read the Plague Tales (although that could easily have been fixed, because most of the Plague Tales is not really relevant to this book), and there are HUGE omissions toward the end. Ok, it's a setup for a sequel, but it's just really annoying. <don't read this bit if you haven't read the book> What happened with Bruce? What is the story with Kristina? How on earth can Janie be pregnant when she was sterile in the first book, or did I miss some actual explanation for this? I like this book, and all of the Ann Benson books, but the others didn't leave me screaming with irritation because there were huge gaps."
2,Perhaps I'm Not Imaginative Enough....,"I felt enormouly frustrated at the end of this book, which is unfortunate as I had enjoyed it until then. I wanted Ms. Benson to take me a little further down the Burning Road than she chose to. The critical conversation between Janie and Tom near the end of the book was left completely up to our imaginations, of which perhaps I am lacking. Nevertheless, I didn't want to have to fill in the story as to how Kristina came to be in addition to a few other critical questions. That's the authors job. Sorry, but I went to bed grousing."
2,Characters become caricature,The second book offers almost no character development from the first book. The same old cliches and behaviors remain. If I read Chris comment on Bobby's shirts again I think I will puke. The first book kept the monster behind the door giving a creepy feeling to the book. The second is straight action-adventure with 2 dimensional Ken and Barbie characters. Not reccomended at all
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! COULDN'T EVEN FINISH IT,"I have read most of DK's other books and enjoyed them all, but this one is something eles again. After thinking myself extremely lucky to score this book from the local library, I couldn't wait to get it home and start reading. Unfortnuately it was so boring I could only read about 70 pages and am so disgusted with the lengthy drawn out descriptions, written in some new age style that I could not bring myself to finish this book. And once Bobby and Sasha come on the scene it only went from bad to worse, with their unbelievable dialogue and inane conversations in the middle of supposed suspense. I hope Dean gets back to his former style of writing that makes for enjoyable reading and not the torture this book was!"
2,Too long too slow,"I found this dragged on. It started out as interesting but then the tale spun into an area of sci-fi that was just stupid. Sorry, but I didn't like it."
4,Don't Believe It,"Don't read ""Seize the Night"" for believeability. Don't read any of Dean Koontz's novels if you hope to keep your armchair and reading lamp in a sane, ordered world. Drop straight into the gooey, sometimes convoluted simile and read ""Seize the Night"" for its ""what if"" potential. And read ""Fear Nothing"" first. The first book about Christopher Snow provides the background for the suddenly appearing mad monkeys, lunatic priests and rabid policemen. ""Seize the Night"" gives Christopher Snow's world a new and more terrifying twist that rivals any of Koontz's previous novels. It solves the riddle of the ""Mystery Train"" ball cap that Snow discovered in ""Fear Nothing,"" and it leaves you waiting and hoping for a third installment in the series. You lack imagination of your own if you can't let Koontz sweep you away with his."
1,A NOVEL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SHORT STORY,"I don't know who edited this book, but if I had a chance to do so, it would be a short story when I was finished. The description of Bobby and Chris' experience in the ""egg room"" took more than 25 pages, most of which I skimmed over. The lengthy, drawn out descriptions and constant side trips into Chris' thinking (who cares? get on with the action!) made this a book a dull read."
2,Not As Good As The Rest,"I have about 20 more pages to go in this book and hate to say it, but I will be glad to finally finish it. Don't get me wrong - I am a serious Dean Koontz fan - I have a hard copy of every book he has ever published and have enjoyed most of them. This particular one I feel just has entirely too much description. I found my mind wandering during a great part of it. Heck, I don't care about details concerning doors and floors. I just wanted the plot to move on. I hate being disappointed by one of my favorite authors, but this one just wasn't my style!"
4,Loved it - More please,"I finished the paperback edition (bought in England)last night. Sasha was a shown in a new light, another reviewer, wrote ""she was stiff"". I think Mr. Koontz has opened a page.......(ex-CIA ? ex-DEA?) Same with Doogie. Bobbie and Snowman's banter is the same as in the old book, but Chris has a tendency to ""woffle"" a bit. In all a great read . The boat ? Mungogerrie and Orson are wonderful written characters. I can't wait for the next book,and by the way my favorite by him is also about a dog - and an surrealistic artist (can't raise the name right now).More please Mr. Koontz"
4,"If you can delay your need for immed.gratification,its Rad!","Midnight, Fear Nothing and Seize the Night...three novels I have read over the past 12 months. And the only three I have read in the past 20 years. Dean Koontz has taken my passion for reading that I possessed as a child (but abandoned in early aduldthood) and made it fun to read again. The character development is thorough and makes it interesting to guess what each will do at every twisted turn. Keep an open mind and Mr. Koontz will carry you away in his imagination. I felt the first in the trilogy was superior, but am looking forward to the terrific(?) ending."
2,Poor writing; good story,"Dean Koontz has a fertile and intelligent imagination. But, sadly, he is not a natural story-teller. In Sieze the Night, the narration often wanders off topic; he struggles with prose; he doesn't always succeed in building and maintaining suspense. Mr Koontz needs a good editor. 2.5 stars for a potential 5-star novel."
2,Great Candidate for Reader's Digest Condensed Book!,"I'm listening to the audio tape, unabridged version and I'm only on tape 7. It appears to me that the book was about 200 pages long, and then the author returned and added a few hundred pages of descriptors. Stating that it was dark out, is sufficient, I really didn't need to know how the dark compared to the black on the other side of the moon, etc. The constant references to surfing terminology is a bit much, but the definitions of those terms is WAY over the top! Enough is enough."
2,"Dean, Dean,Dean, Get a new angle","All I can say is Dean is a wonderful writer. But if I hear the word ""Recombinant DNA"" One more time I will SCREAM!!!!!!! Come On Dean! Something NEW please!!!!!! Just can't beat TicToc!!!"
4,Koontz books' still getting better.,"I thought that, SEIZE THE NIGHT, was a good book, but the his other book, FEAR NOTHING, was better because it hooked me right from the begining. This book it took me a few chapters to make me want to read and find out what happens. The book had to many details in some parts and not enough details in other parts. It also took awhile to get some points across, which made some parts a little longer than they should have been. In some sections of the book it was hard to understand a little bit. The book was good because it kept me wanting to read more. My favorite books are mysteries and suspense novels and thats why I picked this book out. I also wanted to find out what happens to Christopher Snow, and if the mystery of Fort Wyvern was ever revealed. Overall this book was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone, if they liked this kind of book."
5,Awesome Book,"I totally loved this book. This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. I finished this book in one day because I simply could not put it down. However, before reading this book I seriously recommend that you read the first book about Snow called Fear Nothing so the whole story line makes more sense. I would really like for Koontz to write more books with Snow as the main character. Also, this book is a real thriller. It had my skin crawling for two days after I had finished it. If you love being scared this is the book for you."
4,"GREAT BOOK , YOU CANT PUT IT DOWN!!","I got this book for christmas and was one of the best gifts i recieved. It is full of suspense mystery, and the ending is mindblowing.I reccommend this book to everybody."
4,"A great start, but slightly strange development of plot",This was the first book by koontz i have read and i enjoyed it thoroughly. The start of the book was tremendously gripping but the story did not quite develop as i hoped and expected. I also cringed at the surfer lingo often used between chris and bobby. But all in all the characters were great (epecially orson the dog) and the writing was superb.
2,wordy,"i officially stopped reading this book at page 92. I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, his books have overtaken my shelves, but I couldn't take this book any longer. It is way too wordy, the descriptions of a scene go on for pages, and pages. Once I got to the scene with the monkeys I pulled out my bookmark, and placed the book back on my shelf. NEXT!"
1,just awful!,"Nearly 1/2 way through the book, I have given up. I just can't take any more of the oh-so-clever internal dialogue of Christopher Snow. This book is at least 5 times longer than it should be due to the interminable wanna-be-funny musings by the protagonist.So, almost 1/2 way through the book and almost nothing has happened, maybe 2 or 3 major plot points. I found myself speed-skimming to get to some ""meat"" and still it was too annoying.Don't know if this is typical of Koontz, but I may not try any other of his books."
2,"Confusing, long","While I enjoyed some of the chatter between the characters in the book, it really was not a very credible way of communication. The story got so confusing in the end--hallways, stairs, time travel, flashing lights--it was just too much. My imagination just couldn't put it all together."
5,Carpe cervisi,"I loathe science fiction. Absolutely hate it. I LOVED THIS BOOK. It's got a sci fi twist for sure, but the cool thing about this book is that it's written in REAL TIME, which further enhances the scare factor because you feel like you're with it minute to minute. As far as the 'one liners' go, that's part of the guy's character and I wouldn't even really say that they're 'one liners'. I would say that anyone should really at least attempt the first few chapters, because the book is definetly deserving of at least that. If you make it through the first half you will be GREATLY rewarded. Outstanding."
3,"strong entry, good entertainment","As a DK fan of long standing, I agree with some here that he is uneven. This is not one of his best efforts, but it's certainly very good and worth the read. It must be remembered that this is the center of a trilogy, so doesn't stand that well on it's own and isn't meant to. (Any book without a beginning or an ending has a hard road). The pace is a little slow at times and I have to agree with the review that the surfer lingo gets very annoying quickly. Just when you start to like these guys, they start sounding like a couple of spoiled adolescent goofballs. I don't see how their being surfers adds anything to the story. A bit less bargain-basement philosophy-of-life from the Snow character would make the read easier and pick up the pace. A good piece of entertainment."
5,a normal persons reivew for Dean Koontz Seize The Night,"I loved the book great story but, a hard to fallow story line. I think the suffer lingo is cool but needs more. I would like to comment that it is a grate use of branch out story lines but, i fail to see the signifacance of certain avents."
2,Very poorly written,"and without a doubt the worse Koontz book I've ever read. The dialogue between characters was simply idiotic. Racing against time to save a child and a beloved pooch, all the moronic banter between Snow and his socially misfit friends is an insult to the intelligence to any reader. My suspicion is Koontz did not write this book himself."
2,"If this book sucked more, I could have vaccuummed my house","Although I also missed the first of this series of books, starting here with the second, I have no desire to go back and read the first, nor will I knowingly buy the next. I spent longer wading thought the first 260 or so pages than the time elapsed within them. It has interesting details, some unexpected twists (but you're expecting them, after all, it's D. Koons), and very good dialogue - where there is dialogue. The plot seems to have been patched together hastily, and although many pieces come together at the end, the story as a whole seems to be like a patchwork quilt with a few pieces missing - overall it'll work, but if you examine it, you'll see how fragile it is. I was sorely disappointed, as I enjoy Koons' ability to create new stories with different plots & characters. His skills were not used to thier full potential in this book."
1,CD's scratched beyond repair,"I love listening to books on CD while walking,biking etc. This is the first time I've purchased used ones. They are full of scratches which can't be cleaned,buffed or polished off. Thinking my CD player may be causing the problem, I bought a new one. CD's are trash, expensive trash."
2,"Too much description, book went nowhere.","I love suspense novels, this one was so hard to finish because it was so descriptive it was both confusing and idled the plot to a point that I was uninterested anymore. The conversation did not flow in this book either. I found myself skimming through half of the book as it was due to the intensity of descriptions. Too many things that are off plot, and you still are not even sure of who kidnapped the kids at the end. Bad book."
4,Take time between part one and seizing part two...,"I absolutely fell head over heals for Orson in Fear Nothing, and, I really like Chris, Sasha, and Bobby, too. So I made a bee-line for part two - Seize the Night.Once again Dean's heroes are complete - funny, thoughtful, and ready to go the distance for each other no matter how scary it is. The problem is, if you are listening to these books on disc/tape... Dean does way tooooooo much catching you up on the history from Fear Nothing. More than once I fast forwarded and more than once I growled, ""What about Orson!?"". No worries though, it all turns out as it should and is a great story... I want more!As always the imagery and Dean's ability to pull you to the edge of your seat are extraordinary, and the reader (Keith Szarabajka), though at first may not ""sound"" right, is perfect."
4,Total Mega-Woofiness!,"Being a big fan of Dean Koontz and enjoying FEAR NOTHING as I did, I was pleased to see that Snowman, Goodall, Bobby, Orson and Mr. Mungojerrie were reunited in SEIZE THE NIGHT. This story was a little more involved than the first book and I enjoyed it very much. The major problem is, there is so much going on in Moonlight Bay that one or two books doesn't quite clear everything up. That's why I'M waiting for the NEXT installment! Besides, anyone but me think Sasha is a little TOO comfortable with a gun in her hand? I think we need the 411 on this babe. Later Dudes!"
5,Unbelievable step for Dean Koontz,"Throughout this book I was enthralled with Christopher Snow and all of his adventures. This book was the one that made me a Koontz follower for life. Even now, 2 years later, I can't help but wonder when Christopher Snow and his friends will finish off the possible horrors from an old closed down military base. Be carefull when you open this book-you won't put it down until it's done."
3,A Good Concept that Fell Short on Implementation,"I've never been a Koontz fan and this is only the second book of his that I've read (the other being Midnight). Still, the concept of interdimensional travellers invading our time coupled with biotech gone mad was right up my alley. I particularly enjoyed the references to Hodgen's House on the Borderland and the subtler ones to Inasion of the Body Snatchers. Still, I was dissappointed by the second half and ending of the book which, despite it's attempt to play with time paradoxes, turned into a mindless jumble of scenes that seemed written with big-budget movie-option for the screenplay in mind. A little more Hodgen and a lot less beach boys would have done wonders for this one."
4,good book,This was one of the first Dean Koontz books that I've read and it was a good one. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. The suspense kept me reading until all hours of the night. If you like suspense books I would highly recommend this one.
1,BLEAK !,"I should have walked right past this chaos. I used to think Dean Koontz could deliver some masterful suspense and horror. Maybe he could, hopefully he can again, but this book was very disappointing. The plot could have been done so much better, the characters where nobodies, the action was mundane, and the surfer language was just to much."
3,Monkey Business,"Koontz seems to be exploring a new literary type here: a novella enveloping several short stories. Unfortunately, the straight plotline of titles such as Sole Survivor is much more gripping. The monkey scene is fun to read but then there are the coyotes and the crows et. al. that ultimately make the reading a bit tedious. I was disappointed that light-sensitive Snow was never imperiled by his disease."
5,Koontz is a mastermind of intricate storylines--brilliant!,"This second adventure of Christopher Snow and his cronies is a thriller--there's a twist at every corner that is shocking, mind-boggling and intense. It's impossible to put down. Though at sometimes the description was a bit much, Koontz has a knack for storytelling and he chose a unique character about which to write a trilogy. I am a long time Koontz fan, but the action and adventures of Christopher Snow and Fort Wyvern--and of course, his sidekicks (Sasha, Bobby and Orson)--tells a wonderful story that is both threatening and touching. Seize the Night and Fear Nothing are two of the best I've read by Dean Koontz. Five stars--definitely."
2,Tedious but I perservered till the end and was enlightened.,"Having read only Coldfire and loved it, I was prepared for another great Dean Koontz novel, but perservering through the first few chapters proved a challenge. Koontz is an author who can certainly use an adjective or two, and the fact that he can describe one night in ten chapters also proves he has the gift of the gab. But once past the very detailed and lengthy descriptions the storyline began to intrigue me and I was sucked into Koontz's bizarre world of time machines, insane monkeys and oddly, down to earth characters. I was certainly glad by the end of the adventure that I had met the challenge Koontz delivered."
1,disappointing sequel to Fear Nothing,"While Fear Nothing introduced some neat characters and an extremely ""creative"" storyline, Seize the Night adds nothing to this series. The characters do not develop further -- they are like two dimensional caricatures of what they were in Fear Nothing. The plot is like a one line joke (or storyline) stretched out to novel length. The whole book is one good guy vs. bad guy episode after another, strung together with no neutral plotlines or character development in between. Some may call that ""breakneck pace"" -- I call it tedious. Good pacing in a thriller requires some ""down time"" between the tautly suspenseful scenes. A very disappointing sequel."
3,Older The Better,I liked his older works better. They seem more extreme and out there. But nevertheless I liked Seize the Night and Fear Nothing. Snow is a wonderful character.
3,Mystery Train not yet at its destination,"Three quarters of the way through Seize the Night, I wondered how on earth Mr Koontz was going to tie up all the loose threads of the story; and then it dawned on me that this is but Part Two of a trilogy. Yes, the story was fun, but as with Fear Nothing, because this is a first-person narrative and the main characters are referred to in the present tense, the level of suspense is fairly low. Compare that, if you will, to Phantoms, where the reader is kept on edge trying to guess who will live and who will die. In addition, the good guys are smart, handy with firearms, intensely loyal and never at a loss for a witty rejoinder - how can they lose? As I said, this was fun; however, I can't help wishing the writer will come back from his holiday in Moonlight Bay (so to speak) and write us something really mean and moody for the millennium. 6/03/99"
5,Orson is my Brother!,After finishing fear nothing i could not wait to read seize the night and From the first page this book puts you on a roller coaster ride. i could not put it down a Great Read i love that dog. a little advise read the books in sequence or you will be lost.
2,Horrible book!,"The story line isn't all that bad, but the book is filled with ""surfer"" lingo that Koontz feels the need to explain. Reading all these definitions gets tiresome and sort of breaks the flow of the action. It's really hard to get into and way too easy to put down."
2,Writing is too cute and the similes/metaphors go on and on!,"The story was interesting, a more or less novel concept, but dear God, the ridiculous and over-used similes and metaphors diminished the plot and made me gag as did the surfer lingo. When did it become unacceptable to say a persons face ""turned white"" or drained? Why does it have to be ""turned as white as a person half way through putting on mime makeup for an evening performance"" (that may not be the exact quote but it was much like it). Over use of A LOT of terms including ""animal eye-shine"" took away from the intrigue. The surfer lingo was annoying and diminished the story as well. This is the first Dean Koontz novel I've ""read"" (I listened to the audio version) and I'm not sure I'll read another one of his."
2,Worst I've Read,"I know that many of you may not want take the advice of a 13 year old, but trust me this is a book that is not worth getting. I love Dean Koontz, this one being the 5th novel of his I have read, but the worst. You don't get into the action of the story until you're about 80% done with the book. Before that, it's just description leading up to the main part of the story. However, It was saved from a 1 star rating because of its totally unpredictable plot. For those of you looking for a good author you've found the right one, but don't get this book. Titles from Koontz I highly suggest in order are ""Twilight Eyes,"" ""The Servants of the Twilight,"" ""Watchers,"" and ""The Bad Place,"" all of which deserve a 5 star rating"
2,why not write the screenplay and not bother with the book?,"The main character Snowman is well defined and interesting. I liked the book before last that Koonzt wrote, but I think that with this one he saw big movie $ signs. There is too much description, too much special effects, nothing makes sense, except on the screen I suppose, but the dialogues are still good and the relationships between the 3 main characters, and the cat and the dog are interesting, but please write to be published in a book form, or get a good agent in Hollywood and get a development deal."
4,"A Little Too Wordy, but Good","The second part of Dean Koontz's trilogy about Chris Snow, was wordy but good. I thought several sequences could have been edited down a bit without damaging the storyline. I didn't mind the surfer language (found it kinda funny actually) that goes on throughout the book. I look forward to the third book."
2,Would have enjoyed it better if the dog was the hero.,"The story of this adventure/mystery could have been a nail-biter if the hero wasn't so wordy (maybe because he's a poet). He had to explain every thought because of his ego. I just didn't feel the warmth in Chris. Great idea for TV series, because of Chris's XP. Bobby is cool, including other characters. ""Watcher's"" is the best Koontz has done."
5,Just Brilliant!!!! It's the Koontz we've all come to know!,"Carpe noctum...that's the book title in Latin to Seize theNight, the next chapter to the Christopher Snow adventure. AgainKoontz wows the reader with his skill-the use of words, vivid descriptions, and his ability to weave the characters together. It's a whole new adventure for Snow and the gang, but still the same mystery. If you have read Fear Nothing, then you know what to expect from this novel. If you haven't read Fear Nothing, then I urgently suggest that you go read that first then proceed with this one. Good day!"
2,Seize Something Else by Koontz,"Severely disappointing. Shallow characters, moronic dialog, and tedious prose. Koontz is one of my favorite authors, and I've read most of his books and short stories. Some of the early work had one-dimensional characters and shallow plot, but if I listed his titles from best to worst, this would be near the bottom. For Koontz at his best, try Lightning, Watchers, Strangers, Intensity, Hideaway, or Dragon Tears."
4,Seize the Night,"Christopher Snow, the protagonist from the best seller ""Fear Nothing"", has returned and on the trail of missing children. Snow believes that the children are still alive. It will be up to Snow to locate them because the police in Moonlight Bay work their hardest to conceal crimes and silence victims.This story has you on the edge of your seat the whole way through the book. I felt comfortable with the characters. The pace of the book, the scary happenings, the action, and adventure added to the thrill. I can hardly wait for the 3rd installment.Dean Koontz is the author of seven #1 New York bestsellers, including ""Sole Survivor"" and ""Intensity""."
3,"Should be called ""Sieze the Night....Dude""","I love Dean Koontz, and really enjoyed ""Fear Nothing"", but the surfer characters in ""Sieze the Night"" became really tedious after a while. I think I reached my saturation point when one of them said ""wow...that was a full-on Road Runner experience"" or something like that. I guess it's a California thing. The plot also became tedious, and I found it difficult to care very much about what happened to the characters. Very disappointing book from one of my favorite authors."
4,Enjoyable - not as thrilling as Intensity,"Very worthwhile reading, thought not as thrilling as Intensity. A book that I feel good about recommending to my teenagers because it was written without the use of much obscenity - and kept a great amount of energy and suspense."
4,Can't wait to see if theres a third book in the series....,"Koontz does a wonderful job of keeping the reader guessing. He keeps the pages turning in ""Sieze the Night"" by adding a ton of mystery to a very scary story line. I hope that Koontz can find a way to use Christopher Snow's character in at least one more novel. To end the saga now would be a shame. For those of you that are Dean Koontz fans try this book on it will keep you wondering and guessing."
3,Not his best...,"Seize the Night was obviously written for a very young audience. The surfer lingo used throughout left me cold. I also found the unfolding plot so ridiculous that I kept wondering why I was reading the book. Well, how can you not read a new Koontz book. He's written so many outstanding stories that I was more tolerant than usual, and I did manage to complete the book. I never did quite understand the time travel and/or other dimension he introduced. Hopefully, the third installment of this trilogy will be better, and then maybe he'll get on to some more of his serious work."
2,"Koontz is Slumming with this ""Trilogy""","""Seize the Night"", with its paragraph-long, faux-humorous relections and descriptions, seems like the work of an author who is creatively bankrupt and bored. The characters are plastic, cartoonish, two-dimensional, and totally unbelievable. The surfer lingo is so annoying that I was actually (spoiler warning) glad when Bobby was shot. I wanted to shoot him myself. Dean Koontz has basically written the same book about 25 times (boy and girl fight bad monster together, etc.), and Seize the Night is no exception. It reads like Koontz had a bunch of half-baked ideas and he threw them all at the wall to see what would stick (little does). Genetic mutations, exotic diseases, Hell, time travel, serial killers--it's all here folks! Step right in! One last note, if I have to read the words ""sussurant"" or ""preternaturally"" again in one of his books, I think I'm going to scream. Doesn't Koontz own a thesaurus? Save yourself $8 and read a newspaper instead..."
4,Good Follow Up Effort,"I thoroughly enjoyed both Fear Nothing and Sieze the Night. In fact, I felt that the addition of the second novel added even more depth to the familiar characters that were introduced in the first.Christopher Snow has a rare impairment of the skin that makes it impossible to spend anytime exposed to ultraviolet rays, and so he must live in the night.Their small town, Moonlight Bay, is being over run by a government experiment gone bad. His friends, and un-naturally intelligent dog named Orson, his girlfriend Sasha, and long time bud Bobby are the only people remaining that can be trusted.I thought the combination of time travel and quantum mechanics theories was interesting, though Koontz could have delved a little deeper into the issues. But all in all I was very extertained.And for those of you who haven't read the first novel, there's no real need to. Koontz sufficiently catches us up on all that happened in the first book."
1,Dean is slipping,"I've read Dean Koontz for years and always looked for his new book to come out. He is/was one of my favorites. But Seize the Night (for me) just didn't do it. I did not like the plot and it took forever for the author to get to the point. Dean, your slipping."
2,"If anything, seize Fear Nothing.","Seize the Night was a great disappointment considering how good Fear Nothing was. The only reason I read it was because I was left awed when I finished Fear Nothing, but this book contains none of the greatness that Fear Nothing had.Christopher Snow seems to somehow get duller, and the events that happen towards the end of the book are just downright ridiculous. There are indeed some funny parts in the book, some action, some horror, but not enough of any of those things for this book to earn my seal of approval.Read the book for the sake of reading a good book's sequel, but do not expect it to be anywhere as good as that book."
1,Don't bother,Rubbish. This book was overly long and could easily have been halved and therefore more interesting if he didn't keep using two pages to describe something as menial as a lamp. It's all well and good having a vivid imagination but rabbiting on about how vivid it is and then imposing it on your poor reader is unfair and makes for an irritating and boring read!
4,Great book but not his best.,"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz's when he was still writing horror stories in the 80s. His books have progressively gotten away from the mundane type of horror and have broken new ground in the thriller/suspense fields. I found this one just as captivating as his others but not quite as ""fantastic"" as I would have liked. In any respect, if you are a fan of Koontz by all means buy and read the book!"
2,Bloated,"While parts of the book are interesting, the extreme bloating nearly ruined the book for me. Seize the Night is essentially a 200 page novel that Dean expanded to 400 pages by adding page after page of superfluous description, character introspection, and often meaningless dialogue. Had he written it in a style similar to The Vision (which admittedly was more stripped down and bare-bones than the rest of his novels), Seize the Night would have been an excellent, albeit short, novel."
1,This one really disappointed me!,"I have read every single book Dean Koontz has written, and have been an avid fan. In fact, Watchers is my second-favorite book of all time. Lately, however, it seems that Koontz is losing that magic that made us all fans, and with Seize the Night he has descended to a new low. I thought Insanity was a pretty lame book, but this one is worse. The characters are not believable; the surfer lingo and flip retorts in allegedly dangerous situations are not realistic; and the relationship between characters seems superficial and without depth. Has Dean Koontz just burned out? Maybe if he stops producing books so rapidly he can get back to the wonderful prose, superb plots, and clever twists which endeared him to millions of us in the first place!"
1,Where is Dean Koontz,"Although not a fanatical Dean Koontz fan, I have genuinely enjoyed most of his works and consider myself and enthusiast but that may all change if he continues to produce drivel like this. From his ""hip"" surfer talk to the paragraph long descriptive phrases, this book disappoints at every turn of the page. I found it neither entertaining nor worth the effort to read although I did finish it having spent the money to purchsae it to begin with. Knowing that Mr. Koontz is capable of far better work than this only serves to increase the disappointment. The prequel was not much better although at least it was fresh, where this is book could well be the sum of the parts that were cut from the first novel. Could this really be the same author who penned Dark Rivers of the Heart or did he put his word processor on auto-pilot and what we're seeing is a first of what promises to be many ""computer generated"" works of ""literature""?"
2,Carpe... a different book off the shelf,"Two nights and one day of glib wise-cracking by a host of cartoonish characters bent on trying to convince the reader that surfers actually say things like ""it's sharky,"" and ""macking thunders, bro,"" punctuated by brief periods of action... well, wait a minute, the action seems to be all the talking... and paragraph-long sentences that go on and on... time travel me past the third installment, please!"
2,Not what I expect from Dean Koontz,"I wish Dean Koontz would get back to the quailty of work I have become used to, as in The Watchers, Dark Rivers of the Heart, Lightning, etc. I could go on and on but his latest works have left me flat. I don't know that I'll read the third book in this series (although I probably will). Come on Dean give me a page turner that I can't put down."
2,The writing style is too poetic.,Dean Koontz has used far too many similes this time. That makes it difficult for the reader to get through. Christopher Snow is a great character and the reader has trouble imagining Chris Snow thinking such poetic thoughts and musings while in the midst of grave danger.
3,Far from the best,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the books produced by Dean Koontz over the years, even though some have been far fetched. This book took about 150 pages to get rolling. At first I was very disappointed - as I had been awaiting the release of book two in this series. Considering that the characters had been developed in book one ""Fear Nothing"" the plot should have been must swifter. I also thought that the dialog was stilted between the main three characters. I did enjoy the last 1/3 of the book - but Dean has some work cut out for him in book three."
5,my heart still hasn't stopped racing,"wow! what a book! dean koontz has struck the mother-lode with SEIZE THE NIGHT. the snowman and his friends are back(thank god) for another high- speed chase through the quiet hamlet of moonlight bay. the heroes of FEAR NOTHING are back to battle the evils of that nasty little virus created at fort wyvern and stumble across an even bigger threat, the mystery train project. as chris snow and his merry band hunt for the stolen children and snow's einstein-brained dog, Orson. Koontz once again delivers with a strong, powerful story that grabs the reader by the throat and doesn't let go until the end."
2,"hakneyed plot, cookie-cutter characters and no protagonist","This book reads as though it were written in a week. Christopher Snow is virtually non-existent as anything other than a narrator. I know nothing about him other than the fact that he is light-sensitive. What makes him really unique as a person is beyond me. There were some interesting scenes - particularly within the first 100 pages - but if the reader is expecting plot tension similar to, say, ""watchers,"" forget it. Also, the surf lingo and tongue-in-cheek observations of life are also trite and distracting. I have always enjoyed Koontz's novels - I have at least 10 on my shelves! - but this simply does not live up to his earlier work. A big dissappointment."
5,famtastic,I usually don't like scifi but this was a page turner..I loved the characters and the suspence was outstanding..even read the second book fear nothing...would recomed to anyone who likes to read
3,Not as good as 'Fear Nothing',"Like any sequel, ""Seize the Night"" is not as good as the first book ""Fear Nothing"". It does not mean it's not a good book. It is a great and fun thriller, but the amazing charecters of ""Fear Nothing"" disorve more than that. This book is a great way to pass a cold and stormy winter night, like most of Koontz's books, but it doesn't have the great scientific logic that makes Koontz's books so realistic. Nice, but Koontz can do better."
2,"What happened to fast-moving, attention-holding Kuntz???","This book has a clever plot and complex characters, but not clever or complex enough to use so much of the English language. Too many words! Wait for the Reader's Digest version on this one."
3,"Entertaining, but not as good as Fear","My summary says it all -- while I did enjoy this book, it was not as good as Fear."
4,Keep it up Mr Koontz !!!!!,Long live Christopher Snow and his nocturnal adventures. These characters are alive. I hope the journals keep coming.
3,"DEAN, SHUT UP AND TELL THE STORY",I like Dean Koontz a lot but I wanted to shoot myself as I was reading this book. He gets to the point where you feel like Dean just likes hearing himself talk. It was distracting and annoying. It diminishes an otherwise good story.
3,"Not his best, but definitely a good read.","Haven't seen much written about that awesome cat- mongojerrie. When he ""high fived"" Bobbie, I nearly cried. Long live brilliant kitty cats!!!"
3,"A bit disappointing -high expectations after ""Fear Nothing""",Plot got a bit ridiculous with time travel thrown into a very solid plot base that I would categorize as being plausible in the first novel. Too much.
1,"Stephen King once said, at the","height of his popularity, that he could have published his laundry list and it would have sold. Mr. King proved this several times and now, so has Dean Koontz.I have read many, many of Dean Koontz's books and always considered myself a faithful fan. I really feel disappointed. Actually one step below disappointed but I don't know a neat word for that feeling."
5,Another Koontz Masterpiece,Mr. Koontz has done it again. Seize the Night is an extraordinary book. Mixing humor and suspense is what kept this book in my hands for hours. I look forward to the third in the series.
4,More Mooney Mayhem,"Dean Koontz has a style of his own, which frequently substitutes tension-filled drama for advancing either plot or characterization, but his writing is so engaging that page-turning simply takes over and I'm happy I'm reading the tale. Besides, I live near the real Moonlight Bay and find myself imagining this all is really happening."
3,"An Improvement, But Still Not Great","When I saw that Seize The Night was a sequel to Koontz's previous novel Fear Nothing, I was dissapointed to say the least. While I am a fan of Dean Koontz's work, I found Fear Nothing to be one of his worst books. Luckily, a reader can read Seize The Night without having to waste their time with Fear Nothing. This book was a vast improvement and if not for a weak ending I would rate it with four stars. Someone needs to tell Koontz that not all endings need to be happy. Especially if you have created a fantastic mood of dread and suspense in the first 300 pages of the book. Overall, this is an enjoyable read. If the trend of improvement continues the third book in this proposed trilogy will be a great one."
2,Something to read,"If you can get over the excessive surfer lingo and stereotypical characters, then this novel is for you. It has typical Koontz plots--paranoia & the dark side of humanity--it's a thought provoking story filled with the sometimes amusing insight Koontz is known for injecting into his characters if nothing more."
1,Seized up in the Night,"This is one of the worst books I have ever been forced to listen to. My wife and I listen to audiobooks during our hour commute every morning and evening. Unfortunately, my wife is a Dean Koontz fan. The characters are laughable, the plot ludicrous, and once again, Koontz demonstrates his literary diarrhea when using 500 words to describe something which could have been better portrayed with 20 words. Mack Bolan mercenary books or even Louis L'Amour westerns are better written than this trash. Having to listen to another Dean Koontz book may be grounds for divorce."
1,I couldn't even finish it - I think that's a first for me,"The characters were incredibly grating, and their use of slang became unbearable after a while - I had to put the book down. Are there really grown-ups who speak like that? Evidently not too many, since the author felt obligated to include definitions.Regarding the story - the premise seemed kind of cool, but I didn't understand the environment the story was set it. Maybe because this was a sequel?"
3,Let's see...,"The first few chapters had me hooked, but the book seems to lose it's punch after awhile. The surfing lingo tends to get old as well. All in all, not Koontz's best -- but still a good read."
1,Super-Intelligent Mutant Monkey's?,"It had the potential to be a great story. A young boy is kidnapped and a man who is well aquainted with the night must find him and the kidnapper. He even has to sneak into an abandoned military base. But potential was all it had. When it turns out that they did genetic tests at the base and there are mutant monkeys attacking him, I lost all hope. The 50-year-old author trying to sound like a 29-year-old surfer, just didn't work either."
1,surprised,i have read a lot of DK's books and enjoyed everyone of them. i was on page 100 and wondered when will this move on. i always enjoy his characters and thought Chris Snow would be an interesting character; but honestly the lingo in the book and slowness is incredible. they're suppose to be trying to find a missing child. i am disappointed. i will finish the book because that is something i have to do but i am 3/4 of the way through and still not impressed.
1,what a disappointment,What a disappointment! After the page-turner Fear Nothing I was so looking forward to this new book - this one doesn't even come close to that or any other of his books. What's the problem???
1,"Cowabunga Dude, where's a tidal wave when you need one?","I'm sorry, but this mess must have been written by another Dean Koontz, because the one I have read for years couldn't have possibly written this one and the previous ""Fear Nothing"". I'd be afraid to mention any part of the plot for fear of giving something away, but no one would believe all these bizarre things were connected. I read the book and I don't believe they're connected either!And the surfer lingo!I annoyed me to no end and I grew up on the beaches of So. Calif. Will I read the next one in the series? Probably, because I don't give up easily. Will Koontz tie everything up in a tight little package? I highly doubt it."
1,Dragged down by a boring story and poor writing,"It seems that around the late 90s, Koontz was developing a rather wordy, pompous writing style. This book, along with False Memory, is bogged down by puzzling analogies, irritating metaphors, and questionable word usage. We all know Koontz is a great writer, but at this point he begins showing off too much, which is really off putting.Despite the above, a Koontz novel can be saved by a compelling plot. This book doesn't even have one, however. The mystery surrounding this tale is hardly intriguing, and it's a struggle to maintain interest throughout this book.Only read if you feel the need to round out Koontz's bibliography."
2,Can Do,"...but it is definitely not one of the Best Belly Dance CDs out there. There are better Classics and Modern Techno numbers to dance to ... but it'll do. I see it in a lot of stores though ... with a title ""Best of the Belly Dance"" & picture like that, I guess it gets picked up prett-y often."
5,Base para Microfono,"Muy buena base para micrófono, manejable, fácil de usar, sin complicaciones se puede trasladar a cualquier lugar sin problemas, no pesa."
1,MADE IN CHINA,VERY disappointed to find out that YET ANOTHER US company has moved production to Asia.When will it end?
1,Shame on ABC!!!,"I was under the mistaken impression that I was buying a video about the US military's campaign in Iraq. No, what I found was that I bought a video that was more about ABC's Nightline crew and what it was like to be embedded with the US military. The video spends most of its time talking to and showing us video of the Nightline team lying around trying to catch 40 winks here and there.They made no mention of the Thunder Runs and showed no video of these attacks made by the US ARMY's 2nd Brigade (never mind that Fox news had huge amounts of this harrowing attack conducted in early April of 2003).So if you're a Nightline fanatic buy this video. Anyone else should spend their hard earned dollars on other videos."
2,It's all about the reporters....,"This is a bunch of embedded reporters gee-whizzing about ""What I Did On My War Vacation"". If you are looking for combat footage from the front, as I was, you will be disappointed. Yes, there is some combat footage but mostly it's the self-absorbed reporters talking about their experiences and hardships. I gave this DVD a second star only for the segment on Fox Company which was a more genuine effort at reporting what the battle was like."
4,A Great Nostalgia Trip!,"This book is a very entertaining read about life in the early 1970's. With a simple, fluid writing style (including some lovely descriptions), the story follows its engaging, sympathetic heroine, Naomi Hart, as she discovers the world of sex, drugs and rock n roll, exploring everything from open relationships to acid trips with fresh eyes. Think ""Felicity meets Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice."" If you lived through the times yourself, you'll love it. If you were too young to live through it, find out what you missed!"
4,This is a good book!,"I like this one.. why?praise:1)you dont have to be in front of your pc to learn html from this book2)handy dandy reference section!3)covers all the basics adequately4)gives appropriate stylistic advice. who cares if you can script if your web page is plain old ugly and unreadable?5)puts things in a good chronological order6)I learned to code from this book; its pages are bent from my continual re-referencing!7)I like the Idea that there is a series. when I feel like I have time to learn c# or .net I can continue with a familiar source.complaints:1)index could be broader!2)sometimes when I am looking for a specific bit of code it takes me a long time to find it. This book needs more headings.If it had a broader index, more headings, and raw info in the margins for quick refrence it would be perfect."
3,Ok,"This book is ok. I had to get it for a class. The writing is alittle hard to follow, but it is a good reference."
4,FRIENDSHIP,"This is a great story about what being a real friend means.Feather is beautiful and hog admires the attention Feather garners when he flies. What hog didn't understand was that just because he wasn't as beautiful, didn't mean he's not just as good. (or maybe better)Friends of a feather reminds everyone about being yourself and supporting friends.The story is written in a playful style that engages the reader in moments of humor and a bit of drama while telling an effective story that I'm sure most will enjoy."
1,Too much rambling and not much sense.,"The friendship message is fine, but this is truly one of the worst children's books I have ever read. I never thought I would be one to really not like a book--but this is the one."
4,Winged Victory,"One of the great novels about flying over the trenches in World War 1. The only shame is that this edition does not carry the introduction byT E Lawrence ('Lawrence of Arabia') that the earlier editions carry. Based upon the author's own experiences in the RFC it does not glamorise the life, nor does it indulge in self-pity."
5,BLOCKBUSTER NOVEL OF WAR IN THE AIR!!!!,"Based upon the author's own experiences in the RFC in 1918 here is the complete story of the war in the air on the western front. 148 sorties, the slow inexorable death of friends and squadron mates one at a time until only a squadron of ghosts is left, dogfights with Fokkers, air superiority over the Huns, death in the air, flamers (the worst way to die!), Archie, getting tight in the mess each evening singing rousing songs and smashing furniture to relieve the tension, dropping bombs, low altitude ground strafing, slaughtering ground troops with your machine guns until it sickens you, downing two seaters, mechanical failures of your Sopwith Camel while waiting for the new Snipes to arrive from England,gliding or limping back to the lines and safety, mid-air collisions, influenza turning to TB. It is all there. Highly recommended. This is the best book on the war in the air in WW1 I have ever found. Read it, and then read it again. It is that good."
5,Incomparable story of WW 1 aviation.,"This is the finest book of wartime aviation I've ever read. A pilot who took great joy in flying but not in flying in war, Tom's willingness to leave the enemy alone as long as they leave him alone is an eye opener in this era when authors like Stephen Ambrose try to elevate every person in uniform to mythological hero status. I wonder whether the cynicism of the pilots was prevelent during the war or is a reflection of the disillusionment the author and these young men felt in the years after the war? The last paragraph is especially moving, considering what has gone before.Addendum Oct, 2012: An answer to the question of the pilot's disillusionment can be found in two excellent books by Peter Hart, ""Aces Falling"" and ""Bloody April"". The disillusionment set in well before the war was over."
3,Not as good as I expected,"After reading ""The Red Fighter Pilot - The Autobiography of the Red Baron"", ""Fighting the Flying Circus"", ""Flying For France: With the American Escadrille at Verdun"", ""Winged Warfare - In World War I"", and ""Somme Success: The Royal Flying Corps and the Battle of The Somme 1916 "" I found reading this rather tedious in comparison. It seemed rather Harry Tate and not my cup of tea. If this last sentence made any sense to you then you have a chance of getting through it. Seriously, read the Kindle preview, if you like it get it; but I didn't find it to get any better. Cheerio."
3,Mistakes!!,"The book has way too many pringting errors to make it an enjoyable read; at parts the book makes no sense at all.I have found this to be a problem with other books from the publisher, but they were not as bad."
5,I no longer take escalators!,"I travel 75% of the time and I always tell people how difficult it is to get any exercise when you're on the road consistently. I used every excuse in the book (no pun intended). About 5 months ago someone had lent me a copy of your book discipline six steps to unleashing your hidden potential, since then I bought your second discipline book and I no longer take escalators or automated walkways through the airports - it's always stairs, I park a bit further out in parking lots to get a bit more walking in everyday and eating better (not great yet). I push myself a bit more everyday. I will never be like you but then you made that very clear in the beginning of your book. Your books have made a positive impact on my life. I thank you and so does my physician who happens to be a close friend of mine."
5,Conquered a Triathalon using discipline,"Great Book - This book has been effective for me both personally as well as professionally.Last week, I was running the Long Beach Triathalon. The swim and bike went well, but the run at the end was another story - I struggled until my mind went back to the concepts of this book. I started chanting in my mind ""Discipline Discpline DISCIPLINE"". Before I knew it, I was crossing the finish line with a great time and my attitiude where it needed to be."
3,A testimonial,"The presentation of this book was poor. Shame on the editor and publisher. Much inferior to Kern's other works on IT management.As a testimonial, this book was a quick and worthwhile read. Mr. Kern is very impressive. This is a must-read for those looking for motivation and examples of successful, disciplined individuals."
5,Gr8 Book for inspiration,"If you are looking to get inspired. If you are ready to take the next step. If you want to know how discipline can change and positively impact your life, like it did for Harris Kern (the author) then read this book. If you are looking for some miracle cure for your laziness....then this book is not for you. You have to not only read this book but take action!"
2,Just so-so,"A little more about how to actually develop self-discipline, and a lot less about what a superhero Harris Kern is would have made for a far better book. There are much better books out there. See anything by Michael Janke, for example."
4,"""What a gem!""","""Discipline: Six Steps to Unleashing you hidden potential"" - what a gem, I really enjoyed this read. The candor and directness of this book make it personally challenging, it will make you think about all aspects of your life, make some decisions, set goals and get on with it! Thanks Harris Kern, this is the straightforward kick in the pants we all need from time to time."
5,A Very Practical Approach,"I read this book twice. The first time I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down. Not only was i intrigued by the author for being able to apply Discipline so successfully in his life, but I was also drawn by the very practical advice being given in the book.The second time I read the book, i had tried to apply Discipline into my life, but only managed to do it at 5% success rate. The author is right, its really very tough to be Disciplined consistently.However, reading the book again gives a deeper insight into how I can apply Discipline with a higher success rate.I am trying now, and will get back if I am successful."
