5,Fantastic look into the world of social change!,"If you thought this book was about a penny pinching old codger, you were only half right. A revolutionary book that brought about massive social change."
5,Lifted my Spirits!,Began December by reading this wonderful story.Will do it again next year.I recommend everyone start the Christmas Season with this wonderful book.
5,Loving a Christmas Carol,This audio version of A Christmas Carol was great. The narrator's voice(s) were very interesting. It matched right along with the version of the book I used for my English class. We enjoyed the story and enjoyed the narrator's classic telling of this classic story.
4,A Christmas Carol Review,"I like this story because its not all real. Even though its a christmas story it is neat because it is a story about ghosts and sprits , and I like stories like that. I liked the middle of the book mostly because of the sprits and the ghosts. I thought some of the words were a little hard to understand , but other than that I liked the book (story) a lot!"
4,summary of a christ carol,my favorite part was when jacob marley showed up i liked the three spirits when they apeared i thought it could use some more pictures it also could tell what some of the words mean other than that it was pretty good
5,Book for my son,My son loved it. It was good reading for him. He was asked to get it for school and all the children in his 7th grade class are around 13.
5,awesome,Love any thing Jim Dale reads. He really brings the stories to life! My kids really enjoyed this as well.
5,A Christmas carol,I recommend recommending to every one it was awesome me and my mom read it we both loved it s showed lots of describing word and details
5,great read,"wonderful read at Christmas time, would read every year, next time with the family over a couple of nights. highly recommended"
5,A Christmas classic,A Christmas classic to be sure. Charles Dickens is an amazing author if you haven't read it yet pick it up its worth the read.
5,My Kids Loved me reading it to them,"I like reading from the kindle, no torn pages, lost books, always know where it is, just great and I'll order more."
5,One of my favorite stories,"My book is beautiful and in perfect condition, I have always wanted the book,and love all movies on the title"
5,The Real Story,"Authenic, the true Dickens story, just what I was looking for! My Granddaughter was assigned this book for school, which was my original reason for ordering it. What a lifesaver."
5,This has to be the best copy of this book ever,"I ordered this book a long time ago and am now writing my review. I looked at the book again today. The story itself is old and wonderful. I am truly astounded at the artist who painted the illustrations. I want to chop this book up too and frame the art. Incredible. This book is one that you won't want to bury on a shelf someplace but have it close at hand so you can revisit England in the 1800s with so much detail that you are practically in the picture. I also bought a copy for my cousin and her reverence for this book almost exceeds mine! If you are in the market for a copy, this is the one to buy. It will be passed down through the generations and won't end up in the church rummage sale. Gorgeous in every way."
4,Kindle download,This is another work I like to have at my finger tips especially around the holidays. I intend to read this via my kindle again and again.
5,Its A Classic :),I am reading this book with my husband. Loving It so far :) This book is a great one to just relax and read.
4,"A classic, for sure...","I think everyone has seen at least 3 versions of this in movie form (I know I have!) but how many have read the story? I hadn't so I grabbed this to read to have something with a little holiday spirit. It's interesting. I guess because I'm used to seeing the movies, which they have to flesh out a bit and use rich colors and holiday cheeriness, I wasn't expecting the story to be so... simple.The language (from the mid 1800s I believe) can be a bit challenging for those of us who need a little help here and there with anything beyond the modern English language, but it really wasn't too bad. I enjoyed it, but it was hard for me not to compare it to the movies and put faces to the various actors who have played the parts.It's still definitely worth a read. You can get it free from several sources on the 'net or from Amazon, of course. Give a whirl, but be prepared to see Disney characters in your head at times ;)"
5,Classic,"A wonderful holiday read! The definitive story of Christmas redemption, and the original is the best version with terrific illustrations."
5,CHRISTMAS CAROL,Finished this classic tale again. Definitely a classic and one of my favorites. Worth every minute of time spent reading it.
1,For children,I think it is for children and is very easy to read and very childish to me and I don't really like it
5,Great transfer to digital!,"This free version, with illustrations from the original printed book (released on this day 169 years ago - 1843), is a well presented facsimile of the book and is a must-read for anyone familiar with this story only through the film versions."
2,Boring,it was boring until the end ghosts were boring ending was happy get get get get get get get chair
3,Just like the movies,"Pretty much exactly like every movie rendition you've watched. I continue to be a Scrooge apologist: I like his grouchy, gruff disposition."
1,Not the version of this book these reviews praise,"Sadly, this is not the version of A Christmas Carol that these reviews praise. There are no illustrations, no note of unabridgement. However, the text is printed on good quality paper. I've often counted on reviews to help make a purchace decision, but this time I was mislead and disappointed. The story of course is a 5 star classic, and this version a fine read. It's just not the version the reviews indicate."
4,Charles is old but discriptive.,"I read this book, but it was hard to start. Dickens describes almost too much. It is confusing at times. All of his books have to do with social status. So they all have things in common. I would give more away but it is too good. I think you will love this classic."
3,Christmas Carol,"The vocabulary was exelent. It teaches a very important lesson, that we should all follow. The characters are unforgetable."
5,Great Christmas Story,This book was really good. Some parts were a little hard to understand but otherwise it was good. It really explains the real meaning of Christmas.
5,Wonderful edition!,"The combination of the unabridged (un-sanitised) version of Dickens' work, thorough background material, and quite delightful illustrations makes this volume a perfect Christmas gift or addition to one's own collection."
4,Great classic,Very well developed characters and fabulous description make Mr. Dickens such a great writer. Well worth the time on a cold winter night.
4,Great Story,I am enjoying the book. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that there are very many words that I'm not familiar with. I appreciate that I can instantly find the meaning on my Kindle Fire.
4,Fun to read this classic for free,"Free! It was free. Have always loved this Dickens classic. The story has been done over and over, but here is the original. The flowery form of speech loses me at times, and some references obscured by time. I did try the Kindle2's explantion feature a couple of times, but it slowed down the flow of reading. Still a great read."
4,"Review of Jonathan Winters ""A Christmas Carol""","A very intertaining & interesting rendition of my favorite Christmas story, ""A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens"". I have over 30 different versions of this classic and this one is the most unique. If you are a collector of ""A Christmas Carol"" you need to at least take a look."
3,Good basic copy; just a few line drawings to illustrate,"I had never read this classic Christmas story and decided to do it this year before the holidays got off to a start. The story itself stands the test of time(as everyne knows), and I enjoyed the differences in the way English was spoken at the time of its writng, as well as the many references to things that are now obsolete, or practices no longer necessary due to modern inventions. It is a peek back into another century.This Apple Classic version is just a pulp paperback copy, but it gets the job done if you are merely wishing to read content. There are only a few minimal line drawings scattered through the book."
5,"Excellent story, well told","This is a story everyone knows, but it's far more detailed in the book, I enjoyed it very much and highly reccomened it"
5,A Classic,"As always, cuddling up with my kindle, a cappuccino, and Dickens on Christmas Eve makes a magical night! A classic!"
5,Great!,Wonderful edition of the book! Would highly recommend it. It really brings out the Christmas spirit. Everyone should read it
5,Love it!,"I saw this book at a local bookstore and didn't grab it as soon as I saw and regretted it. Upon returning they were sold out and were not getting anymore till the 1st of the year. That didn't work for me since I wanted to book before Christmas. I went straight to Amazon and not only found the book but at a lower price! A Christmas Carol of a classic, of course, but not with the illustrations within this book. Together the book is wonderfully magical."
4,A Christmas Carol on Kindle,"A Christmas Carol remains a Christmas classic for good reason. As it asks us all to live with the spirit of Christmas everyday, it shows Scrooge learning how to be kind and generous and enjoy his family and the people around him. More than a Christmas story, it offers a moral vision of a kinder, more generous world.Charles Dickens' writing style remains accessible and often humerus. The spirit visitors are drawn so vividly, they are quite enjoyable to read about as well. It is worth reading the original, even though there are movie and abridged versions everywhere.While to its benefit, the Kindle edition is unabridged and free, it lacks illustrations. Most printed editions include enjoyable illustrations. This is probably its only defect.Enjoy! Trev from Trevsliteraryreview"
5,A true classic,This is one of the few books i have read and reread. it puts one in the mood for Christmas and is a great picture of the human soul
3,A Christmas Carol,I thought this book was hard to understand sometimes but it was overall written well. I would recommend this book to people who like classics.
5,A Christmas Carol Classic,Just as wonderful as I thought it would be. Saw many movies but never read the book. So glad I did.
4,Review of A Christmas Carol by Dickens,"I like it, but the movies were better for this story because they provided visuals of the scenes. Hard to imagine the spirits without the visuals."
4,Christmas Carol,Christmas Carol is a classic that I think everyone should read. It will change the view on which many people see Christmas. It will also give even the most stingy person the Christmas spirit.
5,Classic Christmas,Wonderful prose depicting the spirit of Christmas and how man and mankind must change. It's a must read for anyone around the holidays.
5,Great story,I saw a musical based on this book and I hate to admit this but I had never read the book and decided it I should. It is a great story. I loved the language and the message of the book.
5,A Coffee Table Keeper,This book remains on our coffee table. Our grandsons love the illustrations. It is a book they pick up again and again for us to read to them. They enjoy this book as much as we do.
5,A Christmas Carol,A Christmas Carol has always been a favorite of mine. I have always liked the moral of story and what it teaches. That each of us can strive to be a better person and yet accept each other as they are.
5,CHARLES DICKENS,ONE OF MY FAVORITE DICKENS STORY AND ONE I ENJOY READING OVER AND OVER AGAIN BECAUSE IT AS RELEVANT NOW AS IT WAS THEN.
3,"A Classic, but ...","Dickensian prose is dated, and at this point I personally enjoy the movie versions more than the book. It was still an enjoyable read, however."
4,A Christmas Carol review,Great classic read. This book is wonderful to read time after time. Charles is an amazing writer and his book is hard to put down.
4,Good Read,I like the illustrations that came with the book. It is just as I expected based on the numerous movies based on the book.
5,Best reading of Dicken's classic,"Absolutely, hands down the best reading of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". Jim Dale is the most versatile voice actor working today and puts forth a tremendous performance in this novel. My family and I listen to this every year and never tire of this rendition. A must have for your family holiday travels."
5,Very Good Illustrated Edition,"Who does not know the story? This is my fourth time through A Christmas Carol and each time reveals something new. I am currently in the midst of reading God and Charles Dickens: Recovering the Christian Voice of a Classic Author by Gary Colledge, and this time through the Christian references were much more poignant. The illustrations in this edition were a very nice addition, and it is nice to see a standard Kindle edition with them. The book would always get 5 stars, and the Kindle version does as well."
5,A holiday tradition,What can be said about a try classic. Read it again and against I do every holiday season. Enjoy and Happy Holidays
5,A christmas Carol,"Kindle download. I've seen the film, listened to a dramatization and finally read the book. Enjoyed it as always. Thanks."
4,A Very Good Book....Especially if you like Mr. Dickens,"I recently read this book, and it is definetly a brilliant book. I don't rate it 5 stars, because there are lots of other books that happen to be better, but I really enjoyed it, and it will make my top 10 List, definetly.I am sure you've all heard the story of the old Scrooge, and how he is haunted by 3 ghosts: Ghost of the past Ghost of the present Ghost of the future.It is very good, and I hope that if you haven't read it, you read it soon. It's very fun, and you'll love it!"
2,prose?,"I bought this but it is some ""prose"" edition and not the original book. There is no ""page 1"" that I oculd find. Very odd. Admittedly I am new to Kindle but all the other books come up just fine..."
5,GREAT,"You must buy this, don't hold back no matter what other reviews say. This is top quality and is a must have if you are considering it"
4,A Christmas tradition,"A greedy selfish, old coot....a night out with the ghosts..... reborn as the Christmas spirit incarnate.... still brings a tear to my eye"
2,Might be OK for the younger set,"Charles Dickens was noted for his beautiful descriptions of life in England and in his Christmas Carol he really hit his stride. He made you see, smell, touch and hear 1843 London. Sadly this edition has slashed (often badly) whole sections out of the story. It might be suitable for younger readers as an introduction to Dickens, but adults or those who love the story will be disappointed with the cuts. The illustrations are nice but they do not make up for the missing parts."
3,"Edited By Ghosts Of Xmas Past, Still An Immortal Treat.","What does one expect with a thrift edition? It is best used as an inexpensive stocking stuffer. This version of the immortal Xmas classic cannot be destroyed by splotchy editing and a difficult to read font size. Purchase a magnifying glass the size of a frisbee, click on the fireplace, snuggle into a Snuggie, sip some Swiss-Miss, curl into the La-Z-Boy and read this timeless work while drifting like a ghost into Xmas past.Personally, I would purchase a finer edition than this. Dickens Christmas Carol is the type of read that must be completed via a REAL book, preferably an old leather bound edition with decorative end papers and such. The tactile creases in the paper, the creak of the bindings, light dust thumbed away on the top ream, the smell of old musks radiating from text, natural oils reflecting off the leather binding...The Kindle serves a purpose but nothing beats an old book."
5,Audio Book,"I ordered the audio book A CHRISTMAS CAROL to use with my class. We are studying the Dickens' novel and I usually read it to them. But this year I have 3 classes and by the end of the day, I would be hoarse from reading. So I decided to order the audio version of the unabridged text and it worked like a charm. Jim Dale, a classically trained British actor, did a wonderful job using many voices to read Dickens' masterpiece and it really came to life for my students."
1,Double printed,"I recently purchased this for a gift, but when the book arrived the whole cover had been double printed. We are sending it back and hopefully can get a properly printed book or our money refunded."
5,Loved It!,"The Kindle version I read didn't have the illustrations that some reviewers have mentioned, and it obviously didn't have the wonderful binding, but it did have the story the way Dickens wrote it, and that was a joy to read.I've watched many film versions of the story down through the years, and I'd expected to be so familiar with the story that I'd be bored reading it, but the opposite actually happened -- I loved it.I sometimes found myself noticing bits I'd either never seen in the films, or, if I had seen them, I hadn't paid them much mind. Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level. Rather than an abbreviated, two-hour video, I got to enjoy the entire thing and spend as much time as I wanted savoring morsels the video would have glossed over."
2,Not unabridged....,"I read ""The Christmas Carol"" in its original, unabridged text every Christmas season. Outstanding writing and word usage, to say the least. Moving descriptions within a theme that is, well, ""the theme of our time"". I unwrapped this CD eagerly and started the CD player. NOT unabridged, I quickly discovered...and much to my disappointment. I'll save it for my grandson as an early experience of this Dicken's work. The experience left me asking: how could they advertise thisd CD as ""UNABRIDGED""? Does anyone have an answer to that? Please?"
5,1$ is all this cost me; Amazon Prime = free shipping; This is a great gift idea; Dover Thrift Books are all that is awesome.,"1$ is all this cost me; Amazon Prime = free shipping; This is a great gift idea; Dover Thrift Books are all that is awesome. Seriously good stocking stuffer for Xmass, office gifts, low cost gift for friends, et cetera. In fact, if you need a copy of ANY book check out Dover Thrift and Everyman editions first. They only have older books but it is worth it. The quality is sturdy if not refined but they always look ""handsome"" as books should."
3,Missing pictures,"What can you expect of a free book. Story intact, however. A quick read, with delightful albeit archaic turns of phrase."
4,Test,Test test team to the point of this is not the point is you reality that the government of India
4,Christmas is all around,"A trifle heavy-handed on the religion, but only a trifle, and it is a story about Christmas. In any case, one of Dickens' classics, and deservedly so."
5,A ghost story,"I read the book A Christmas Carol by: Charles Dickens, abriged by:Vivian French, illustrated by: Patrick Benson. I really loved this story, because of how it had the ghosts in it. It shows how people can change just like that. My favorite ghost was the ghost of Christmas Present and how that ghost shows how nice some people can be and can't be. You should really read this story...it's the most common story about Christmas. These are all of the ghosts in this story, the ghost of Christmas present, the ghost of Christmas Past, Marley's ghost, and the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Enjoy this story."
5,A Christmas Carols,"The Christmas Carols help me learn the real meaning. IT mean the have the best thing does not ma ke you a better person.Llke Mr. Scooge in this book he had all th money in the town ,and did not give any to the poor."
3,A nice reading.,An excellent classic. A great writer but from the point ot view of the subject a bit dated. Anyway it is worth reading and I enjoyed it.
3,The Christmas Carol,"This book was ok, I was a little young to read this book I think. But it was cool how if I didn't know a word that I could just highlight it and get the definition. The book was very good and I loved the message! I hope to watch the movie sometime!"
5,Fun and interesting,"Like most people, I've seen version after version of Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL. It's a great story but I'd never read the ACTUAL story. I finally downloaded this version to my Kindle and dug in.I was surprised to see how much of Dickens actual dialogue has been used by so many of the filmmakers. The language is dated but seems to add to the appeal of the story for me. If you can get it at the current price of FREE, please don't hesitate to do so."
5,A truly wonderful Christmas read!,"This is my first read of this timeless classic, but not my last. Recommended reading for everyone of any age. Read in one day on my new Kindle fire. Thanks dad and Sandy for this great gift. Skip"
5,THE song of Christmas past.,"Sing it, Sir Charles.As long as there's a soul to be touched. As long as there are graves that give men pause.As long as there are children in need, or hearts full of greed, sing it!"
5,great book,"this is one of the best books writen. It encompasses life, death, greed, and hope. One of Dickens better writings"
5,A Christmas Carol,"This is a very good book, and it is well written. It has a good plot and includes just the right amount of fantasy. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves Christmas and magic."
5,Feel Good Book,"This book not only taught me a lesson in life, it also made me feel great to have a great family that is very caring. The one lesson this book taught me was to be nice to all people and be a good person. If you aren't ghosts will haunt you. Just kidding on that last sentance, but being a mean person will come back to get you in various ways."
4,Good book.,I thought it was a good book. It's old english which just adds color to the book. I liked it. I'll probably read it again.
5,Exceptional Story of Redemption,If you have not read this book to your children or have not read it yourself....you are missing out on the understated meanings behind this wonderful classic. A must for any library!!!!
5,Always a good read!,"As fun to read as to watch! While not the true Christmas story, it certainly captures the spirit of Christmas and the effects of living one's Christmas faith in the incarnate Lord Jesus."
5,Love this classic.,"A holiday staple in my home, I re-read it every year. It's a classic that always reminds me of the true meaning of Christmas and life."
5,A Story Worth Reading As Well As Watching,"If you live in the English speaking world and have spent any time around a tv during the month of December, you know the plot.Is the story worth reading and not just watching? Very much. It preserves the poignancy of lost time and redemption that is at the heart of Scrooge's story - even more than a religious message. Dickens addresses the reader directly, and there is more humor than most adaptations show.This edition has an interesting account of the first time Dickens read the story to a general audience - the beginning of Dickens' career in performing his work which proved almost as lucrative as the mere writing of it."
5,A GREAT book for any time of year!,"A Christmas Carol, in my opinion, is one of the most perfect stories of all time. I first read it so long ago, and I am devoted to watching every convoluted Christmas movie ever made based on it!This Enriched Classics version is perfect for me. It provides an excellent refresher on the life and times of Charles Dickens, without hitting the reader over the head with an outrageous data-dump of factoids that contribute nothing to your enjoyment of the author and his story.This book would be a well-appreciated gift for any fan of Dickens. Even if you own another version of A Christmas Carol, this affordable and portable history belongs in your collection."
3,SE-6030,looks like a good heavy duty charger. the rectifier was laying lose being held only by the wires. might have been cliped on the bigger heat sink? pluged in and smoked it this gave power to the 12v dc cooling fans. I insalled a older 110 fan and made it work. poor job on the rectifer. they changed from 110v to the 12 v fans because it was cheaper. after this I hope it last as long as my old 30 year charger.
2,Poor Quality Control,"I bought one of these a few months back and my problems began....First one of the wheel brackets fell down inside and I had to take one of the side panels off to get it back . Once I got the side panel off, I noticed there were quite a few little nuts and bolts laying loose in the bottom of the unit. Next I found to my dismay that the screws included to install the handle would not fit. I had go find others. The top panel seems to move very easy. I had a little Schumacher that lasted for over 20 years. Now I would not buy another one."
1,To sexual,"same as season 2 not something I really want on my computer. I can see how it could be addicting, not something I want to spend time on."
3,Not as good as the other seasons,"I watch The L Word since it's debut on TV, and I have to say that the 4th season is by far the weakest one. All other seasons had an intensity, a passion and were very interesting to watch while this 4th season had a lack of that. In the last episode I was still waiting for the season to get more dramacity, more intensity and suddenly it was the last episode. It felt like 2nd or 3rd episode. The acting still wonderful though!Now I'm looking forward for the 5th season, which I've heard it's gonna be great!"
5,Great value on series,We think it's a good value when you consider the cost of a cable pay station for the year versus the price of the DVD's that we can watch at our leisure. The DVD's work just fine and are of excellent quality. We buy the collection every season.
5,L-word,"I really enjoyed this set of videos and will continue to collect each season, as long as shotime will put them on the air, but i really do wish they would put bette and tina back together."
2,lackluster and lazy,"This season of he L word is probably the worst written season thus far. The story arc is disjointed, the individual character storylines appear to not have anything to do with the previous season's story arc and the camera work is pedantic. The music which was a standout element in season one and two is equally lackluster.If you are a fan of the show save your money, and if you are a new to the show invest in season one or two."
4,L for Lucious,"This is a definate must for all L Word fans and is worth the buy as a collectors item. Although not as mind blowing as season one, the characters have evolved and we feel more a part of their lives as ever before. As we view this season, there are plenty of erotic scenes which never lets, heart renching moments and laughs.It is worth every penny spent and I look forward to further seasons."
4,The L word,"I enjoyed watching the DVDs all over again, just as much as when they played on Showtime."
4,Too bad Marlee won't be able to watch....,"Yes, ironically, this TV series, with a deaf lead, actually does not have subtitles for the hearing impaired.The show is great, but this unbelievable oversight shows a pitiful lack of sensitivity (as well as common decency) on the part of the producers."
3,After Season 1-3 I found it a bit boring.,"I loved to watch Season 1-3 and so I was a little disappointed of what happened - or rather not happened - in Season 4.Before I even noticed, I watched the last show and it was over.The good:I especially liked that Shane is taking care of her brother. And that Bette and Tina get along better is very nice to see.What I really liked was the story around Tasha, the military girl. The conflict she is in shows how stupid the war is and what it does to people.The bad:What's up with Jenny and why are they still talking to her? She is putting out everyone's life in The New Yorker and even makes it into a book with the worst phantasy in names.Why is Tina, being back to the heterosexual crowd suddenly an outcast?The story around Helena is so ridiculous, I was tempted to forward...All in all I am looking forward to Season 5."
2,it thinks it's better than it is,"I liked Artanker's other album, so I ordered this one with the expectation of it being just as good. As it stands, it seems like it wants to be better than it really is. I was surprised that there was a whole bunch of DVD extras and music videos, definitely a bonus, but the content was just underwhelming. If you like aimless semi-groove mushroom music, this is probably pretty good, but if you're looking for something with a point, you might be disappointed. Maybe I'm just not hip enough..."
2,Just OK,"I originally heard Artanker's album, Mature Fantasy, and was really interested in exploring more. That album is excellent, while this one is not. This album will sit in my collection without being heard."
2,Looks fine but is too bulky,"You get what you pay for. This product looks fine, but the belt clip is so wide and bulky that it causes the phone to flop around. Not a practical belt clip, but fine if you just want to use the cover alone."
1,Poorly designed case,this case looks nice and feels tough but it does not fit on the phone. the buttons do not match up on it and it presses the camera button down constantly. poor design. very disappointed.
4,Good product,"The crystal case is very good. Especially the smoke color gives my phone a good feel. Good protection overall I should say. Arrived promptly. Doesnt feel like a cover at all (like someone already mentioned)Downside -No Screen protectionA bit thick (which makes it sturdy). But could have used a tougher and thinner material to make it really sleek.Overall, a great buy for my pearl 8100"
4,review,Does what its suppose to do. The top of the case kind of hinders the top drag down screen of the EVO and you have to put a little more effort in using the drag feature.
3,Mixed emotions,"I can play Zucchero's soft ballads over and over again. They are wonderfully romantic and melodic. I do not, however, care for his attempts at rock. If you're looking for Italian pop, there are better,but if you want to hear some soft and intricate ballads, most of this CD is for you."
4,Zucchero in Spanish,"""Diamante"" is a 1994 compilation of Zucchero's most famous songs, of which a few of them were recorded in Spanish. Problem is that, even though the Spanish lyrics work well in the more slow songs like Diamante and Senza una Donna, in the rock songs (like the Spanish version of Diavolo in me and even more with the Spanish version of Solo una sana...) the Spanish lyrics don't really fit into the song. If you're a fan and want to get your collection complete, buy it! If you're new to Zucchero you'd probably be happier with ""The best of Zucchero sugar Fornaciari's greatest hits"" (always buy the Italian version, the one that has Donne as the first song)."
1,Really disappointed,"After listening to Andreas Bocelli and Eros Ramazzotti, I was looking forward to adding more Italian pop to my collection. I had heard Zucchero's duet with Andreas and thought I would be happy with this CD. Nope. One or two songs were ok, but overall I did not enjoy it. Unfortunately, it's headed to my ""mistake"" CD pile."
2,Not recommended,"Let me start off by saying a friend lent this book to me knowing how much I treasure helpful, positive books about cancer. I'm not entirely sure if this is a true story or not, but the overly-dramatic writing made me feel like it was an attempt to minimize the struggle of those who truly have cancer. The events didn't seem to tie into the emotions in the story, unless of course the events, or the emotions, were over-exaggerated in a way that reminded me of an old college roommate I suffered through that had been diagnosed with histrionic disorder (where there drama surrounded even the smallest of things).As far as a book to help those struggling through cancer, I would recommend highly No Place Like Home by Girard, which is very beautifully written and will give the reader more of a feeling of relating to the author."
3,Misleading Picture,"The picture on Amazon would lead on to believe that you get 3 replacement buttons. You only get one and the shipping costs about the same as the one button you get. Other than that, the button was what I needed but I thought I was getting a couple of extras."
4,My First and Favorite George Thorogood Recording,"I first heard this disk on vinyl when my college roommate pulled it out from his stack of twelve records.I immediately loved George's flash and in-your-face playing style. After all these years I still do.This disc has one of George's best track lists, including ""Who Do You Love?"" (popularized by many commercials--Sam Adams beer the most recent); George's signature Rock & Roll version of Hank Williams' (Senior) Country and Western classic 'Move it on Over'; the story-with-a-moral 'Cocaine Blues'; and another George favorite, 'Baby, Let's Set a Date'.This is also one of the better-recorded Thorogood recordings and is enthusiastically recommended for newbies and oldies alike."
2,This DSD is not well done,"George Thorogood's slide guitar playin' ROCKS! The quality of this remastered SACD does not. The fidelity is so-so and fluctuates, and there's anomalies. I thought that maybe that was the condition of the master tapes, but when I bought this album on vinyl it was perfect!"
1,not for the album just the seller,I bought this CD used here from a dealer and never got the CD. I did get a refund but I wanted the CD why advertise if you don't have it?
1,"Adorable toy box, nightmare to assemble","This circus toy box is vibrant and fun looking, but the holes Guidecraft bored into it are too small to properly fit the screws.If you're looking for a unique, pretty toy box, then this is one to consider. However, you should have a drill and your own screws on hand to complete its assemblance. Then you'll be glad you bought it. Otherwise, this product is bound to frustrate you."
2,Not as good as Sierra's other pinball games,Thrillride is hard to see. You don't know where your ball is a lot of the time. It doesn't go to other game boards like other Sierra pinball games. Wish I'd known that before I bought it.
1,Will not install,"On my XP system, this ancient software (1999) will not fully install. The install simply fails (it really does not start) or then tells me that I need a new disc or some other nonsense.Worthless."
5,Holiest of All,Besides the Bible this is the best book I have ever read. Very helpful for a new christian.
5,The need of every Christian is...,"...to know who Jesus is and what He does. Murray, in this wonderful exposition of the letter to the Hebrews, explains many necessary things. This book has edified my life a lot. Of course, our ""must"" book is the Bible, but this one helps a lot."
1,Bad OCR conversion from print version,"I admit I did not buy this version of the Kindle ebook. When I clicked on the book cover to ""look inside"" I was horrified at how sloppy this kindle product is. Look for yourself. It appears someone took the PDF scans of the print book, processed it through OCR software and used the result without any proofreading, correction, formatting, etc. You would do better getting the other kindle edition of this book found elsewhere here on Amazon or get the free Kindle version from archive.org[...]"
4,Arlen Roth - Virtuoso of twang,Great player. Roth synthesizes the styles of Clarence White and Roy Buchanan with a bit of Amos Garrett tossed in. Nice slide work and fantastic tasty twangy leads on blues and country tunes. He's played as a session man with a wide range of folkies and folk-rockers. He also has some teaching materials out. I'm surprised he's not better known.
3,Disappointed,The book was not in the condition I was expecting from the description given. It is quite worn with ink stamps throughout the book from a previous owner.
1,This is horrible,"I teach this play in High School and was looking for an alternative to the Welles and Polanski versions to help my students understand the play. This is not it. This one is horrible. Badly acted and directed and very difficult to follow. If anyone is looking for a video version of this play that is easy to understand and useful for teachers, there is a pretty new version of the play on DVD available on this site directed by J. Bretton Truett and E.J. Kerwin ( B0000639O1 ) that is outstanding for educators. They perform most of the play and include a great deal of video analysis as well. The performances are very good and they use a modern setting which is very effective. There is also a wonderful feature that lets you get right to the text from the video and back again."
1,"It's a tragedy, all right.","Poor Jeremy Brett must be turning in his grave every time this film is run. This is an unintentionally hilarious version of the play that should scare the high schoolers for whom it was made 'off' the Bard forever...The problem is the director, the acting, and the costumes. The only good thing about this version of MACBETH is the script, which is still Shakespeare's... If you are fond of this actor, do yourself a favor and watch another SHERLOCK HOLMES episode, or MY FAIR LADY, instead."
1,APPALLING DVD despite great actors,"I love Jeremy Brett and Piper Laurie. Their combined talents offer what few enjoyable moments there are to be found in this Macbeth, but they unfortunately can't salvage this atrocious production. Seeing it is enough to turn someone off Shakespeare. (Should that happen, Al Pacino's delightful LOOKING FOR RICHARD is the perfect antidote to restore passion for the Bard). But I digress. I want to issue a warning to all who might assume the DVD version of this Macbeth would be superior to the VHS. In this instance, tape was simply transferred unto disk with no remastering or enhancements, and there are no extra features. The visual and audio quality is appalling. I regret buying this DVD when I already owned the VHS (..like I said, I love Jeremy Brett...) The only advantage is being able to skip the boring parts to get to the monologues. But that isn't saying much."
1,Tragic Production of a Great Tragedy,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with just about everyone else who has reviewed here this film production of ""Macbeth."" I found the video in my local library and was eagerly anticipating another fine performance by two of my favorite actors: Brett and Piper Laurie, especially Brett. I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed every one of the BBC Sherlock Holmes productions numerous times, and just recently was impressed with Brett's interpretation of Bassanio in the '73 TV production of ""The Merchant of Venice."" So, imagine my great disappointment when I was amazed by how awful this ""Macbeth"" really is. I would prefer to not fault the actors, but can only think that the director and producer were responsible. Not to mention the costumer and the ""set"" designer. I would strongly advise anyone who loves Shakespeare, Brett or Laurie, or all of the above, to avoid a most unpleasant experience."
1,Worst -- Macbeth -- Ever!,"First, you can watch this train wreck for free through Google video.Second, find it and watch the ending just so you see Brett's ridiculous Macbeth costume. His tights look like cheap, ill-fitting long underwear with the crotch almost down to his knees. This is during the final scenes where he spits death in the eye, so it's pretty hysterical. With the fakey swords being waved around it brings to mind children horsing around in the backyard."
5,Lady of tone,when i hear her sing it is so mesmorizing.she is so smooth and hypnotic.i love vocalist for different reasons and hers is pitch.she was a fore runner for the brillant nancy wilson. this disc is a must have.
5,What a wonderful CD.,This is my first Ella Fitzgerald CD. I love every track on it. She has such a beautiful voice. I listen to it over & over. My toddler enjoys it also. Thanks for all the reviews. They helped me decide to buy this CD.
5,At Last - Sailors' Valentines,"John Fondas seduces the reader with brilliant photographs of a long forgotten Victorian art form know today as Sailors' Valentines. A brief history of America's whaling heritage takes us back in time and rightfully credits Barbadians with designing these titillating mementos. With prices for antique sailors' valentines soaring, this may be the closest you'll ever get to owing the real thing. This octagonal book clearly shows us why a picture is worth at least 1,000 words and after poring over 95 pages, I clearly wanted more."
3,An Excellent Economics Text By A Political Hack...,"A very interesting look at the economic thought ofone of the most important players in the Bush White House.Oddly, much of Bush's economic policy, including his emphasizeon tax cuts for the wealthy, is sharply at odds with Mankiw'sbasic philosophy..."
4,"Fairly clear, but no math, and not very rigorous.","Well-written book: tries hard to restate conclusions and show how changes in policies and variables affect aggregate functions, etc. Sometimes confusing: doesn't always state whether a trend holds in the short run or long run.Since I'm more used to micro, I found the vagueness of all the curves a bit maddening, as well as the lack of definitions and real-world indications of variable values. More importantly, there is basically no math here: I don't see how this book could possibly suffice for a grad student in econ (which I am not).Interesting book on tough subject."
5,One of the better ones,"This book is very well written in terms of clarity, succintness, content, and readability. The various examples and real-world cases offer great (and immediate) opportunities to apply the theoretical material of pages past. The book utilizes proper notation and vocabulary while maintaining a readable text devoid of verbose or academically pretentious wording. In terms of shortfalls, the technical readers will be driven nuts by the lack of certain important events, concepts, and the feel of a specialized-for-economists book."
3,"Exciting, But Not Terribly Informative","As someone who has been involved in Russian legal matters for the past ten years, I found this book quite interesting, if not always accurate. It is not so much that it is inaccurate with respect to what it reports, it is that it so much sensationalizes Russian business that it ignores the great multitudes of Russian businesses that are out there slogging it out just like most businesses in the West. So while I greatly enjoyed the book from a mostly prurient perspective, I did not find it terribly helpful in improving my knowledge of Russian business."
2,Russes Terribles,"I think Mr. Zbignev Brzezinski - a former US National Security adviser under President Carter - would enjoy the book. This is because `Casino Moscow' was written by his young nephew - Matthew Brzezinski. Plus it portraits Russians in the most unpleasant light - some people like that! Certainly, to his credit, Mr. Matthew Brzezinski has reached new heights in his creative Russia - bashing. The author has actually moved a full circle from his uncle's traditional Truman-like anti-communism to the age-old loathing of everything Russian by the Polish ultra-nationalist aristocracy from Marshal Pilsudski camp.I am not sure if this loathing is unjustified, but the question I am asking is simple: is Mr. Matthew Brzezinski really the right person to represent US business community in Russia (as a WSJ correspondent), or may be he is a little biased to bridge Russian and American points of view? No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica."
3,Scared to death of Russia now?,"Man, had I not been to Russia as many times already that I have...and I was getting read to leave and had read this book, I would be too scared to go!!! Mr. Brzezinski's book is entertaining at best. It glances over some important parts in today's Russia. However, it is too damn moralistic and bemoans the same whining, bitching and complaining that 98% of all the expats living in Moscow complain about...it's not like home. Well, duh...If you have been following news out of Russia, this book will add nothing new to your bank of knowledge. If you have never been to Russia and you are getting ready to go to Russia, don't let this book scare you away."
1,Brzezinski Pontificating with Ethnocentric Tunnel Vision,"Brezezinski offers nothing more than personal asinine butchered urban tales that appeal to people like himself--droll dunderheads lacking in both originality & sincerity. ""Moskviche"" would love to thank this ""author."""
3,Despicable Russians,"Despicable RussiansI think Mr. Zbignev Brzezinski - a former US National Security adviser under President Jimmy Carter - would certainly enjoy the book. After all, `Casino Moscow' was written by his young and talented nephew - Matthew. Plus it portraits Russia in the most unattractive light - what a feast for an old Russophobe! Certainly, to his credit, Mr. Matthew Brzezinski has reached new heights in his creative Russia -bashing. The author has actually moved a full circle from his uncle's typical Truman-like anti-communism to the more traditional and age-old loathing of everything Russian by the Polish right-wing aristocracy. I am not sure if this loathing is unjustified, the question I am asking is simple: is he really a right person to represent US business community in Russia (as a WSJ correspondent), or may be he is a little biased to bridge Russian and American business interests? No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica."
4,Great Graphic Novel,I really enjoyed this story and seeing some of the darker side of the justice league as well as some deeper emotion from some of the characters. The plot was great although I do feel there was just a little bit missing to make it a 5 star review for me personally.
5,First Comic Book I've Read (Aside from Tintin),"Pros------ great story line IMHO, sparked my interest in reading more comics- surprised by the detail in the drawings, characters faces were pretty expressiveCons------- as a first time reader, the way the comic book lays out the story was a bit confusing (compared to a novel, it reads like movie or cartoon script might be like), but I into the style quickly enough. Does take getting used to though."
3,Great JLA comic,This is an excellent graphic novel the story line is good and the art is great. Reading this will help your knowledge of the DC universe history.
3,Should not have been a comic book...,"My problem with Identity Crisis is that Brad Meltzer doesn't have much experience with comics, and it shows. While the story is commendable, the execution wasn't. The strength of Identity Crisis is the writing, with the art having to make major adjustments.To me, comics is about the balance between text and image. If the writing is the star, why have a comic book in the first place? Sure, it's about DC's properties, but superhero stories aren't limited to comics.Now there are those who didn't like the ""big reveal"" of this book's climax. And I'm one of them. I felt I was duped. I should've given this book two stars, but I appreciate the process--the events that led to the climax. And Rags Morales tried to make the book visually interesting."
2,"Holy holes in a story, Batman!","Trashing long-time characters wearies me. I won't divulge any key plot elements, but the solution to the mystery is such a stretch, it reminds me of when writers were commanded to have Alfred rise from the dead and be revealed as ""The Outsider"", way back in the early days of the ""new-look"" Batman. E.g., at one point, Hal Jordan, another DC character they keep re-trashing, who knows who the killer is since he's now the Spectre (whew!), tells Green Arrow to really punish said killer when they uncover him/her. Well, when you find out who the killer is, you'll realize that Hal would never have said that. Any rate, the motive for the murder is so convoluted, all I can say is, DC should let the pros (Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Keith Giffin) write these epics. And enough with killing and defiling the memories of long-time characters!"
1,Identity Crisis,"So Batman erased the memories of a few people, big deal! The JLA makes it into a huge issue paramount to a far greater wrong, if indeed it was wrong to begin with. I'm collecting a few (okay, more than a few) comics for my son, and I find a rape of all things in these pages. The purpetrator of said rape is one Dr. Light, who is able to generate high temperatures through his skin. The panel in question shows only his hands burning those of the victim; aparently not someone that you want to be raped by.Why is there a rape in a comic book? Why does D.C. need to have so many different realities instead of just allowing for different storylines (It really isn't a real universe, just make-believe)?Truely cutting edge. Bold. Daring."
5,Great book!!!,"If you want to see your comics all grown up I recommend this book. It is going to change how you feel about the whole genre. It is an adult tale with moral questions and attitudes. It shows what can be done when publishers set free writers and artists.Both writing and art are greatThis is the book that started a whirlwind of controversy. People loved it for it new fresh take on the superhero world and how it can be undone by one tradgedy.Others thought it to mean spirited and made villans more evil than they were in the past. I can see both perspectives, I however embrace change and feel that the book is just a step into the new comic universe being built.As you can tell I do not want to give away anything of this book. I will close by writing how if you read comics this is a must read. If you have never read a comic please pick this one up it is worth it."
4,"Great beginning, Down ending","It started with such hope, and some powerful emotion. The ""secret"" some of the characters hold was interesting from a story point of view, but the actual facts in evidence are rather cheesy. As for the murderer being revealed along with the method? Well, that came close to ruining the story for me. Still, a great read with some great moments."
1,One star may be too much. Hack writing at its laziest.,"Seriously, I cannot fathom that people gush over this book.Essentially, what IDENTITY CRISIS was supposed to be was a 'whodunnit' for the DC Universe stable of characters. However, in a world of telepaths, sorcerers and men who shoot laser beams out of their eyes it falls embarrassingly flat on its face. Meltzer composes a story full of plot holes, bad characterization, and enough tired cliches to make any true fan of the genre wince.Quite possibly the only good comment I could make is that the artist is quite talented... other than that, not a lot to recommend."
5,Great book.....,"The book at first seemed very thin but inside the set up was great. The book is devided into sections such as typical boy girl and my favorite indihino names. It is a book many family and friends will ask to see when thinking of naming their kids. It is small but it is good. Some baby books give you common names or as I call them filler names such as Pedro or Rosa, names I am sure people have thought of already but this one gives you names that you havent."
4,Enjoyable but audio quality is not the best,"There are some beautiful, romantic, popular tracks on this CD.I agree with one of the reviewers - if you are new to her material there are better recordings available. The tracks on this CD have been selected from different LP's. Some of the tracks present themselves very well. The microphone glitch mentioned by another reviewer is not much of a problem - it does not spoil the number. In fact that particular track has extremely well captured vocals. On the down side there are few tracks that have considerable tape hiss and degraded sound quality - to a point where they interfere with the listening experience."
2,Surprisingly not that good,"OK, I am not a musicologist etc. but am a long time fan of both Desmond and Mulligan so I was all set to love this album, but I didn't. Mulligan's playing seemed lifeless and Desmond's lyricism was not in evidence. This is probably unfair but they both seemed to just be going through the motions"
3,i recived two bottom rotors,I got two bottom rotors.I wish they could send me one upper rotor.also the package was quite beat up.The rotors i recived were quite good.
5,If you appreciate talented musicians with great chemistry...,". . . then you really need to give this CD a spin. This band has some amazing musicians that give some traditional music a vibrant sound. Great recording and mix. From the liner notes, Michael Doucet writes ""From Cajun to Western Swing to Hot Club Jazz, these cultural bohemians bring us a refreshing new chapter to the continual creativity of Louisiana music."" I loved it!"
2,Certainly an old book.,"This book has lots of old, and I mean really old, information. Most of the lathe photos shown are of machinery not produced of over 50 years. It does have some good information, but I""m not sure it's worth the price."
5,Easy reading,ordered this book to help me get started on my new hobby. I have found it to be helpful with lots of tips.
3,"Great all around guide, perhaps a little dated, but still very relevant","This book, covers all the basics of the lathe parts and accessories, however could cover techniques and common practices used today more."
3,"Mystified my four year old, for a minute","In more capable hands, I am sure that this illusion would look much better. It still amused my son, and even though he figured out the gag, he still asks to perform the trick now and then. And there isn't a better measure of approval than that!"
3,Toddler Magic Trick,"It's a simple and easy trick, but don't use for an audience older than 8. It's very easy to figure out. You can become very bored with this because their are not a lot of options to do with this trick."
3,+ 1/2 Stars...Charming British Folk,"I discovered Martin Carthy through Steeleye Span, a band he played in off and on throughout the Seventies. Carthy's work with that band, however, did not entirely prepare me for this solo album first released on Rounder in 1974. It is truly a solo recording with Carthy accompanying himself only on guitar--and on two numbers he sings a capella: ""Mary Neal"" and ""John Barleycorn,"" the latter in a version that will not be recognizeable to those who know it only by way of Traffic or Jethro Tull. Carthy is an accomplished British folksinger/guitarist and while he may not display the same virtuosity on guitar as Bert Jansch or John Renbourn in terms of fancy fretwork, each of these ten traditional songs have a warmth and charm about them. [If ten tracks seems a bit short, three of these songs run in excess of six minutes each.] For those who like their folk music traditional and uncomplicated, this will satisfy you more than adequately. RECOMMENDED"
3,A terrible DVD edition ruins a great series.,"First off I just want to say the my son loves Pingu. The problem I have with this Cd is how poorly packaged this is...No MenuNo Chapter selection.It's impossible to choose between eposodes and if you go past the last one it stops the DVD and you have to put up with the stupid FBI/Interpol warnings.Bottom line: I'd wait until a better edition comes out or start off with ""Chillin' with Pingu"" (also sold on Amazon) which actually has a menu.Note: We rented a DVD at Blockbuster called ""Introducing Pengu"" which was a better deal than this one (more episodes and an actual menu) so hint hint Amazon - sell that version instead.Shame on Hit Ebntertainment..."
2,Ugh!,"My 2 year old grandson wasn't interested. There is no dialogue, just noises used to communicate. Not worth the time."
5,Great DVD for toddlers,"DVD quality: DVD has 6 episodes of Pingu, each of 5 minutes. HIT entertainment could have added a few more episodes or supplementary material to this DVD. DVD has no menu. So, you've got to start at chapter 1 and play through/skip chapters to get a specific episode. However, these minor flaws are compensated by the thoroughly enjoyable storylines.Content quality: Great for kids, esp. toddlers and pre-schoolers will love it. The penguins speak in their own, non-verbal language called Penguinese. Pingu conveys an array of emotions - he plays with his friends, takes care of his sister, cares for elderly people, helps his parents while having fun and playing harmless pranks. Sometimes he gets bit naughty too but at the end he realizes his mistakes and feels sorry.Overall, a great treat for all ages."
5,Pingu Rules,My 18 month old daughter adores this DVD. Pingu and his friends experience every day problems with a good attitude and fellowship.
1,spy toy,This toy should be in a dollar store. $1.00 would be too much.If I could give this toy rating of (O) I would have.
4,"Price too high, but hours of fun!","My daughter who is five, loves mysteries ala Scooby-Doo received this as a gift. It was a big hit. Requires parental interaction...she asks to solve a new mystery almost daily. We hide the clues (written in invisible ink), she takes pretend pictures and catalogs them, brings them back to 'the lab' for analysis, even interrogates our cats and dog showing them her 'badge'. The crime scene tape is fun, too. Requires imagination. However, for the contents and quality should really be priced under $20."
4,Anchor,"This is a great anchor. Only reason for 4 star instead of 5 is they need to make something to cover the spikes when using the rubber cup side. Nothing like a long night of playing , than being impaled when breaking down your drums."
5,hate the title but loved the book,The title comes from that quote attributed to Mark Twain. I don't like the title because I don't think it is right to equate statistics with lies. Some people who misuse statistics distort and tell lies though and since that is what the book is about the title is appropriate to deescribe the content. There are many good stories in here to learn from.
2,"bland, disappointing","Not a bad book, but I was disappointed. Instead of interesting ideas and unusual approaches, Best makes a whole sequence of fairly obvious points that most people would come up with on their own. Better books on the same general topic are by A.K. Dewdney, John Alan Paulos, and Cynthia Crossen."
2,"Promising topic, but....",...doesn't deliver on the substance. This book was very disappointing in its very superficial treatment of the topic.
4,Good book for the general public,"If you have no backround in statistics and you tend to believe the numbers you see in the newspapers or on TV, then this book is a must for you. It offers a wealth of examples and explanations. (I would give it 5 stars for such readers.) On the other hand if you are already skeptical and have some knowledge of statistical methods you may find this book slow reading. Still it may have some value for you because it tells the story behind some of the frequently cited statistics that is interesting to read even if you know the statistics cannot be right. (3 stars.)"
2,so much promise...so little substance,"This is a topic that has a lot of promise and one can do so much with it. However, if you're looking for anything more than just the basics (with a few good examples from social statistics), don't bother with this book. This book starts out by identifying the reasons why statistics get distorted, but then after every 20 pages or so this book reads like the script of groundhog day - the same three points (innumeracy, people with a vested interest and apples and oranges comparisons) are referenced again and again. The topic is fascinating but there is very little substance to keep you occupied for more than 30 minutes."
4,Critical Thinking Beyond the Equations,"I teach stats, and it is really easy for students to leave class and remember nothing. They don't remember any of the equations that they learned for the exams. They didn't learn to think critically about numbers. They didn't learn to think about using statistics in their other classes, lives, or businesses.I use a traditional textbook, this book, and the Cartoon Guide to Statistics. I hope that my students take away some real lessons. If I could I'd be tempted to ditch the regular text."
2,"Good points, but misleading applications","I teach statistics and research methods to both undergraduates and graduate students, and am always on the lookout for news articles, advertisements, and the like that illustrate any poor and improper uses of statistics in the ""real world"" in order to get students to recognize them more easily when confronted by them. So it was with great expectation that I came to this book. And I would have to say that I was not disappointed in the statistical points raised. They are all right on the mark. However, as I read through example after example of the misuse of statistics and statistical thinking, I began to notice that the bulk of them were made by liberals. The ""subtext"" message that was coming across, intended or not, is that only liberals use shoddy statistics to further their political agendas. I bought the book originally with the hope that I could use it as a supplementary text for my students, but because of this perceived bias I won't."
2,"For simple people who don't think critically, and the media","This book basically tells you that statistics are products of human activities, and can be and are often influenced and (mis)interpreted by people creating them and hearing them. If you already knew this, then this book is not for you. If not, this might be a good place to start finding out about the misuses of statistics. Since there are few examples of the proper use of statistics, this would not be a good place to find those. I found that the main point (mentioned above) stretched out over 170 some odd pages made for a repetitive read."
1,Too many pages for too little information,"I like to read nonfiction, but this book is absolutely brutal. (Wouldn't have even given it a star but Amazon thinks you haven't rated it if you don't click at least one.) It could have easily been condensed into a single chapter and given the reader the same insight. Many of the same points are reiterated over and over - many times I had the feeling that I had read sentences before. Although it gives several examples of questionable statistics and describes their consequences, the author doesn't do well describing the historical derivation (or motive) in how they were generated."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I do not reccommend this product. I bought it last week, since it's clame to fame was making your existing games 3D and ""jump out of the screen at you"". Well, it did what it said it would do in the program demos, but not without heinous flickering of the screen. It didn't work for any of my existing games, but I'm sure it works with the bundled software, but those didn't interest me. I was very disappointed with this product. They call it ""amazing award-winning technology""... Just buy some .99 cent 3D glasses and rent a cheesy low-B film and get better results. Stay away from this product!"
1,Stay away! Warning!,"I have bought this x3D gaming system in April 24 2005.I couldn't make it work at all: Not all CRT monitors are supported. Part of them requires a spacial power adapter, which the manual sais: ""Will be supplied (sent) free of charge"" upon request.I have called the company several times, and sent many emails.I even talked with someone called ""Ray Murph"" who promised me few times over the phone ""I'll get that in the mail to you shortly"". He didn't. They just ignored me.The company doesn't exist anymore. It changed its name to ""Technical Opticallity"" and moved to NY.Now it's June 2006 and I have no power adapter and no X3D gaming system to play. I have wasted my money. J&R; took no responsibility.Don't buy this stuff!!! Don't repeat the same mistake I have made!Eyal"
4,Wonderful product for kids,My son loved this casting kit and wants more. It is easy and fun for them to do. I recommend casting kits for kids.
5,Depends on what you like,"I've noticed that with all of these trance CDs, people either think that they're amazing or that they suck horribly. I, myself, thought that ISoS 2-3 were absolutely horrible, but loved this; others, on the other hand, thought the exact opposite: that this CD ruined Tiesto's spree.But, nonetheless, this CD simply blew my mind. The second CD was absolutely superb; I thought that it was better than tranceport and the rest of the CDs in the ISoS series.Go listen to parts and decide for yourself. Perhaps you like this kind of trance, like me, or maybe you won't. It's not that simple as ""this sucks""--people have different tastes."
2,Im sorry it came to this...,"This cd was a huge let down. #6 on the first cd (La Noche)is the best song one both cd's. I was worried he would ruin the best trilogy in trance, and he did. ISOS 1-3 are incredible with 3 being my favorite. But this cd is just plain boring and bland."
3,More house than trance,This is my first Tiesto CD that I heard. IMO It's a very good House CD. Not as laid back as I would have liked to call it a trance CD.
3,lots to give but little given,"The reason why I love most of search for the sunrises is the originality at the beginning and the transition into a new sound, voice, lyric, beat, bass, background I have never heard mixed together. The only songs that actually start off and begin to finish like that are number 5 and 11 on the second disc, otherwise it is a continuation of the same song with the same background one track after the other. However, it is still good lounging music it does not have the originality I so much adorn for in tiesto"
5,One of Tiesto's Top,"The Latin beat is a little minor, but the overall feel gives this Search a great different feel. Not crazy dance, but good background techno. Fits well with quiet modern sensation."
1,Tiesto your mix and track selection is bad !!!,"I seriously don't think this cd deserves the avg rating it has got. This has got to be the ""worst"" in search of sunrise series by the `so called #1 dj' Tiesto...The very first song when crossfading with the second is patchy ...which means he cant get the basics right of beat matching. He could have at least perfected it in the studio before the release. (Im sure everyone who bought the cd agrees). Also there is no proper direction in the music. The tunes are not catchy...they are really boring...and sounds like someone is learning to play the keyboard (except Coca & Villa - La Noche), even the vocal tunes here are horrible.Tiesto has lost my vote for the top dj poll (paul van dyk was always #1 for me and will always be)I regret buying this CD. And am depressed with the current state of trance music. Only Paul Van Dyk can cure me with his Politics of Dancing 2 CD."
1,"IF YOU LIKE TO LANGUISH IN PAIN, BUY THIS!!!!","AGAIN TIESTO GIVES US ONE MORE REASON TO HATE HIM, WHY CAN""T HE JUST GO AWAY AND LEAVE US ALL ALONE?"
5,Best In Search Of Sunrise Yet,"Tiesto's ISOS series is the best trance has to offer. I didn't get into his second one but the first and third are legendary and are followed up by this masterpiece. The first cd was flawless and led perfectly into the second cd. I loved the latin american flow it was very dancy. ISOS was always dancy but with euporic and ambient sounds mixed in which is what set it apart from his magik series. The best songs on this double disc were BT's Force of Gravity, La Noche, Moments, and of course the Midnight Express. All on the first cd but the second cd is well worth listening to. Much different but keeps with the theme perfectly. Cudos Tiesto. You are the man. Ill see you on July 3rd in Atlantic City. That will be the show of the year for independence day. Can't wait."
3,"This album is not as good as ISOS 1,2 or 3","I agree with previous reviewers that this album falls short of legendary series of In Search of Sunrise 1, 2 or 3.Something is definitely lacking in this album. I personally think that tracks are not that great.I have read a notes on tiesto's web-site that he wrote about this album. He actually pointed that at this time there is not as much original music as there was back in the days of ISOS 1,2 or 3. This can be argued whether true or not, but as a huge TIESTO fan, seeing him perform live 3 times and anticipating this album for so long, in a way he has brought down a trance legacy of ISOS with ISOS 4. For those who haven't heard previous versions, I trully recommend you get either one and you will be enjoy it very much as these albums made TIESTO who he is today as well as MAGIK series that are more upbeat."
5,Bonzo!,"If you're a drummer you'll really enjoy this book. Fantastic amount of detail including, equipment and Bonzo's influences. Lots of photos too."
2,Meh!,"Nothing new here about an extremely gifted talent.This book is a good start if you know nothing of him and you are about twelve years old. For the grown ups I recommend Jimmy page's bio ""Light and shade"" ,which offers much more insight into Bonhams abilities and how he was recorded.Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page"
4,World's Greatest Drummer!!!,"I read this book about John Bonham & thoroughly enjoyed the story although I must admit that me not being a drummer, I didn't really understand the technical terms in some instances. I believe another drummer would really enjoy this book! John Bonham was the master of timing! This book is a good biography of his life which was too short."
4,"Simple, Somewhat Effective, Labor Intensive","I live in Colorado Springs where the winter humidity is frequently down in the teens. After purchasing six of these registers with filters, I was able to increase and maintain my home's humidity by about an additional 10-15%. However, during cold periods where outside temps stayed below freezing, I had to refill these registers about 3 times a day. I don't know about you, but all of my floor registers are not easily accessible and running around the house 3 times daily to refill the registers can become burdensome. The bottom line is that they work and have saved me the expense of a whole-house humidifier. Be aware also that the wick filters are required for the registers to work correctly, and each filter works about 90 days."
1,FLIMSY PLASTIC Vent Register = SAFETY HAZARD!!!,"This is advertised as being made of durable plastic, but it's cheap, flimsy plastic. The heater vent I wanted to use this on receives some traffic, and when I installed this, it easily ""gave"" underfoot. It didn't break, but it gave a LOT and I didn't put my full weight down on it, since I realized from looking at it that it was cheap plastic. For my safety (and the safety of everyone else in this house), I removed the register and am back to using the original STRONG metal register that was there to begin with. This cheap plastic humidifier register is now sitting in its box, safety out of harm's way. I wish I knew how to return this for a full refund...In short, STAY AWAY FROM THIS REGISTER if it's going to be put anywhere where people might step on it!"
3,moderate sequel,"Note that this was reprinted in 1996 together with ""Janissaries 2: Clan and Crown"" by Baen as ""Tran"".This book is not in the same class as ""Janissaries"" (1), but still is a pageturner. A bit spoiled by intrigue of the nasty sort."
4,"Fun, Fighting, and 70's style females again!","If you like Janissaries and Janissaries: Clan and Crown, you'll enjoy Storms of Victory. Things are getting closer to ""The Time"" and either destruction at the hands of the Shalnuksis and their human servants, or perhaps some alternate fate mediated by those same servants.It's fun, it's got long battle scenes, it's got Rick in trouble again and again, and a growing Wanax becoming quite a leader. The Romans are there too, and even a fairly high risk encounter with a safely fanatical (and therefore we know he is evil) religious leader.I kept hoping Jerry and friend would wrap this thing up in book III. Pity, they didn't! And now I see they've still not finished book IV. Pity.I first discovered books I and II some dozen years ago and enjoyed them immensely. Recent rediscovery was just as good as I remembered, even with the somewhat dated depiction of the main female characters.A very good read, especially for the war historians among us."
4,"Please, Please, Finish the series!","This is a good series. I enjoyed all three books in the series, even if it did take quite awhile for the third one to be published. The worst part to this series is not knowing if the author is ever going to finish it. We were left hanging at the end of the third book. I hate it when authors leave a series of books unfinished."
3,Unfinished work,"Book is the third in a series,however the forth has not been published and it has been a long long time."
3,i for one liked it.,"i am not sure what the reader from Amherst read but i for one enjoyed the book. it does have some areas that are not as strong as others but it was a good read. i am curious to see what this writer will put out next. while not a book for everyone, it is certainly much better than much of what litters the bookshelves"
4,better than i thought,"I used it in England recently, it took me to my destination without getting me lost I am not sure it was the quickest or shortest route. I went to destinations I have done many times before, it clearly took me a different way, occasionally thru a lot of small country roads. What I found amazing, was that it warned you every time there was a speed camera and the speed limit, which is very helpful.the MP3 player is pretty descent.The blue tooth quality of sound was poor.Could not find list of airports which would be helpful, like the VZ blackberry phone GPS has."
4,Garmin nuvi 670,"I purchased the nuvi 670 prior to travelling to Sweden and Ireland on vacation. After driving through the small streets of Ireland I'm a believer in this product.Ireland has been updating their freeways, so the device showed I was off-roading. I've seen this ""feature"" in other GPS products, so it isn't just a Garmin issue.The size/portability, user interface, and intuitive design of the product were perfect.Now that I'm back in the US, I use the product to listen to books from [...]. Another great use for the product, since the large screen is superior to my previous listening device.The only negatives are the windshield mount and the Blue Tooth link to the BlackBerry. The windshield mount is a terrible design. It takes a while to find a flat surface that it will stick to. That's difficult to find on a mini-cooper windshield. I haven't been successful linking to the BlackBerry, but I haven't spent that much time. The devices don't see each other.Would I buy it again - Yes."
4,Very easy to use but with no possibility to customize,"I'm French and I used this GPS in US and in Europe.First don't use french translation in US. Abreviations are not correctly interpreted: Examples Dr = Doctor, St = Saint ...The large screen is very good and acces to the different functions is very simple.I have a MIO 230 GPS with European maps. On the MIO, it is possible to define which information I want on the screen, and I can customize a lot of automatic functions. With NUVI 670 it's not possible.Conclusion : a good simple GPS without sophistigation."
4,user friendly,"I replaced an iQue 3600 with this GPS. I did not use the Palm features of the iQue so switching to a nav/gps only unit was not an issue for me. Naturally, I purchased the 670 because it has the European maps. This unit is extremely user friendly. Accuracy is more than adequate. I can think of nothing negative to say."
4,So far so good,"Ordered for outside sales work. Have built-in GPS in my personal car which is proprietary for Cadillac so my comparison is to that unit. Has not let me down yet. I did not buy this unit for handsfree phone so have not tried that feature yet. Gets very close to the destination. I have used it in Texas, Oklahoma and New York. Every set of directions were right on. Has only sent me out of the way by 2 blocks for a u-turn. Only issues...wish it had a better temporary mounting surfaces for rental car usage. Sometimes does not let me zoom in/out far enough to really see the details. Could use more POI's and alternative ways to input your destination.Overall, very good product. New Garmins are voice activated and that seems like a great feature. Not interested in that, choose this one."
5,Lots of info in a little tiny box,"The nuvi 670 is quite good, I would highly recommend it. I have been able to use all of the navigation features, load and play music (MP3 files) through the built in speaker and through the car's FM radio without much effort at all (i.e. no instructions and success with little delay). So I'm big fan of whoever designed the human-machine interface I think they did a perfect job. It is both efficient and intuitive. The maps are unbelievably good, yet not perfect.One limitation to keep in mind, the memory card slot is for SD cards, not SDHD cards. This wasn't a problem for me as I wasn't looking for more than 2GB of extra memory."
1,Nuvi NOT new,"I bought a new Nuvi 670 on July 29, 2008. Today, August 12,2008 I happened upon a notice that said the Nuvi 670 was discontinued. I'm rather upset with the news. Nowhere was the discontinued status mentioned. How long will Garmin support the unit? I understand that products do have a lifetime, but it should have been stated in the Amazon blurb."
3,Garmin Nuvi 670,Overall a decent product. Has some shortcomings but this review is limited at this point to the German region. We have noted sometimes a delay with acquiring a satellite signal. The roundabouts are not clearly shown and maps are not fully updated for some of the areas we have been too. Real view is not an option that I can tell and we truly miss this feature found in the Navigon and most Asian navigation systems. The price was decent so I can't really complain. However I would have to see a dramatic improvement in the software to buy another Garmin.
2,Sucks for UK highway system,"I am stationioned in England and bought the 670 just for the US/Euro map combo. While here, I have traveled much though the country and mainland Europe only to do so taking back roads. The speed camera thing for me worked, but it won't take me on the highways!!! I keep getting told ""at round a bout, take 2nd exit..."" or the like. NEVER staying on the highways. Does it do this for the states as well?Garmin folks told me to plug in detour to the highways. Well, it'll only let me use one, then it wants to replace the previous.This thing does suck! It's great for navigating throughout the system iteself and all it's options, but sucks navigating the roads, where it counts."
5,Highly recommended,"Used this in Alaska for 10 days of travel and it provided directions flawlessly. It even knew hardly used roads that are well off the beaten path. It also located well using adresses or POIs selected from thier list. Good directions, sound, functions, visuals and is definitely small enough to take while walking or hiking. I have an installed system in my SUV and actually prefer this Garmin to it now."
2,Who needs the pricey options??,"I looked at all the Nuvi models. Unless you love gadgets and can deal with complicated add-ons there is no reason to buy anything more expensive than the Nuvi 650. No blue tooth, no crappy MSN and no FM radio (how stupid).The 650's processor, GPS receiver, screen, case & battery are IDENTICALL to all of the more expensive Nuvi 6XX series.Hey I love gadgets folks but we are not helping the people who read these reviews for some common sense answers to basic questions if we do not point out which models for basic functionality.Originally I even questioned the larger 4.2"" screen - Why?: because you should not be looking at the damn thing when your're driving. Set your destination before you start and just listen to the excellent voice instructions.For those who just want a very good GPS navigator spend no more than what the 650 costs.PS: I thought everyone already had a bluetooth headset for the cell phone?Garmin nüvi 650 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator"
1,Terrible Mac support...,"Terrible Mac support...Mac's must use Internet Exlorer to access many links... unavailabe after January 31, 2006,according to my research..."
5,"Easy, fast and powerfull","I have had other GPS before this one. This holds all the US and Europe maps, has an incredibly bright and big LCD display, is multilingual and extremley interactive and easy to use. I LOVE this one, and I will take it now to Germany with me."
5,Nuvi 670 Review,"Having had the nuvi 670 for a bit over a month, I'm very happy with it. Directions seem to be clear and the map very readable. Also, I'm very glad I got the wide screen.I'd like to be able to turn the volume up a bit higher than the current maximum, for noisy situations, and I've seen a few cases in which the directions given can be improved on by someone with local knowledge - for example in approaching a hotel near LAX off the 405 - but overall I'm very happy.Ordering the optional dash mount make excellent sense, as I'm based in California (no window mounts allowed) and it's more convenient, and probably safer, than laying the unit on the passenger seat when I drive a rental.Looking forward to trying it out in Europe and, with the right maps loaded, in Australia.Next purchase is a Garmin Colorado for hiking!"
5,Essential Travel Item,"Just took this to Italy. It was just great for driving. Option for selecting ""truck"" versus a car keeps you off the smallest streets, a plus if you are not used and do not care to drive the small windy roads in the mountains or within cities. You can also insert a waypoint to avoid or bypass certain areas. Very up to date. Only a few new intersections or rods were not mapped. In the ""pedestrian"" mode, you can use it to wander a city, after marking your parking place. One problem is the slight ambiguity of which way to start, when walking. A north arrow would be good. Also, the battery will run out if used continually for a few hours of walking, so be careful. Be sure to have the 12 volt charger for the car. Other than those two issues, it was absolutly great.The Fedor Europe addition was pretty good, but not must. Overall, I would not go without it. I also use it extensively in the US, as I travel often."
3,Map of Europe: a deception,"I have bought this GPS because I wanted one to use in both America and Europe. On my recent travel in Eastern Europe I was shocked to learn that despite the fact that this GPS was advertised to have maps for ""Europe"", in fact, it covers only a tiny fraction of the continent. ""Europe"" geographically ends at the Ural mountain. The ""European Union"" includes 27 countries. This GPS DOES NOT even cover the whole EU, not to mention ""Europe"": it does not have maps for a major part of the EU (e.g. Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria...). This item was advertised to have ""full coverage of Europe"" - in my eyes to exclude half of Europe (home of over 50 million people) is a deception. I was very angry with Garmin when this device let me down at the Austrian border. What would you say if the ""full coverage of North America"" would in effect mean that the states of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were missing."
5,Nuvi 670,This product works great out of the box and it is ideal for those who live in the USA and also travel to Europe. The new version of the Europe maps is very detailed and impressive.
5,the Nuvi 670 pocket /Vehicle GPS,This is the Best darn GPS on the market I tried the Garmin 3600 iQue and this is better by far. easy to use touch screen and it works like a charm. I also like the bluetooth hands free compatibility with my cell phone when I'm on the road.We plan a trip to Europe and this GPS has European Maps. I mark this GPS a 5 star buy
4,Excellent - But Lacking,"Great GPS... BUT...I bought the nuvi 670 because I like to travel to Europe. However, I use it in the US for every day business and work mostly in the same city going from address to address. Unfortunately, unlike other less expensive GPS devices out there, I have to type in the same city name over and over again while conducting my business. Why couldn't they have programmed a ""favorite city"" or ""SAVED"" cities list to select from??? This becomes very tedious - ""TOO BAD"". Everything else is good."
5,Garmin Nuvi 670,Excellent product. I do a lot of travelling and will not go anywhere without it. The traffic feature is great and it is very intuitive. GREAT GREAT GREAT product.
5,Garmin Nuvi 670,This product has more features than I'll ever use but those that I have used perform very well. Purchased for 4.4 inch screen and European maps. The 'voice' of the unit is very clean and understandable.
5,Garmin nüvi 670 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator,"We found the Garmin 670 to be extremely user friendly and fun to use. It it right on so far and we've had it now for a month. We'd purchased a Magellan prior to this purchase and took it back because it seemed awkward and difficult to use. The Garmin is easy to view, understand, and finding other places of interest is a snap. We highly recommend this product, especially the Garmin nüvi 670 4.3-inch widescreen along with the portable mount sold on Amazon. We haven't yet had the chance to use the bluetooth feature ... it's coming tho' ... ;-)"
4,gex,arrived quickly and in good physical condition with no instruction booklet. clean and not scratched. was hoping for a instruction booklet.
3,fun but frustrating,"This game has plenty of diverse levels, but the camera is difficult to handle. For this reason, the game can become very frustrating. The character does not really increase in difficulty or skill. My 6-year-old son seems to be the only one still playing this game."
1,Gex: Enter The Gecko,"The only reason to play this game is to see just how bad a game can get. The comments are very annoying, the game play is bad, graphics are jerky - you name it, it's bad!Don't get this game!"
1,My review,Graphics are very harsh on the eyes. I played this game for 10 minutes and it gave me a headaches due to the strain on my eyes.
3,"Funny, with the smart-alek remarks, but challenging","I have had this game for a while now, and it still keeps me laughing. Gex always has some smart alek remark to say. You do have to pay attention though, or else it is easy to get lost. In each level some of the television remotes are easy to find, and some are hard. So it gives you a good mix. You find the easy ones first, and then you want to go on and find the harder ones. In the begnning it can be a little hard to figure out all the moves, but after that, it isn't much of a problem. But I do have to say that the camera angles can be annoying."
3,Problems with the camera,"When I first started playing this game, I was enjoying it. However, after about an hour of playing, I started to feel nauseous. I quit and went back the next day and again felt nauseous. I tried a few more times, but discovered that the camera which shifts around was the cause, so I was not motivated enough to continue playing. My children did not seem to experience the same problem and really enjoyed the game."
5,Gotta Love Bugs Bunny!,"Hilarious! Bought this for my Dad who loves Bug Bunny. More specifically, I purchased it for the ""stupid-igit-dragon"" cartoon (which he loves). This may be one of the only videos that contains this cartoon. Wish I could find it on DVD!"
5,Okily-Dokily-Do,"Bart is absolutely, positively correct! I remember watching this film when I was a young lad and how much I loved it!...Its the only good one to have come out of the Looney Tunes department! Thank you for finally rereleasing it on video!...Time to bring to DVD though!...If you wanna buy one of the Looney Tune movies...buy this one!"
4,Why is there a review for Lethal Weapon here?,"The Looney, Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie may not ever be on anyones list of the greatest movies of all time, but it is a fun way to spend an afternoon. While the title ""Friz Freeling's Looney.....Bugs Bunny Movie"" and his short ""history"" of film comedy seem somewhat self-serving, (as well as announcing ""An oscar winning Cartoon Short!"" at the opening), this is easily forgotten as the movie progresses. Personally, I feel that these shorts work best as individual films rather than editing them together with some new footage to create a ""New"" story, but at the same time, give this to kids as an alternative to that Pokemon garbage. This was when cartoons were GOOD!"
1,Friz Freleng's Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie,"I think the funny part in the Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam cartoon ''Knighty Knight Bugs''that Bugs Bunny hit Yosemite Sam with a hammer Then,he showed his polka-dot underwear!"
1,Beneath criticism if not beneath contempt,"The previous reviewer claims ""Jesus never hated anyone."" He did seem, however, somewhat angry at the money-changers in the temple - not becaue they were carrying on a business as such but because they were cashing in on the gullible under the guise of religion. When I went to a lecture by the Reverend Mr Fox on ""creation spirituality"" at the local University, it was interested to see tables set out outside the lecture theatre selling his books with a merry jingling of cash-registers. No prizes for guessing what it reminded me of. Who:whom? Lenin was wont to ask. In this case; who got the money? And how does this alleged apostle of anti-capitalism get the wherewithal to travel the world promoting his ill-written and error-filled books? Hardly ""religious right"" questions but worth thinking about. As for the actual intellectual content of the work, it is beneath criticism but not beneath a proper contempt."
2,road through kurdistan,"the print size is too small. I won't be reading it (not unless I want to bring on sore eyes, the need for glasses, and a headache). If I'd known the print was this small I wouldn't have bought it. Sadly to return it will cost, and so is not an option."
4,Excellent Book for Practice!,"When I purchased this book, I hoped that it would help me improve my SAT score. It has helped my improve my score, but lacked some of the tricks that I had expected to find in it. This book offers a great amount of practice problems and excellent explanations, but it gives very little information about some of the test taking tips that other books give. So, if you're looking for a book that gives you a lot of practice with verbal problems, this books is excellent. However, if you hope to find tricks of the trade in this book, look somewhere else because this book gives very minimal."
5,Reasons y u should not take classes to do well on your SATS,"Kaplan Verbal Workbook is a book everybody should use in order to do well on verbal. Kaplan provided tons of practice problems, tons of words for me to study, and tons of tips for me to know. Well there is a downside to it becz it doesn't give lot of tricks and tips as other books but you'll be able to find out by yourself. I raised my score by 180 points using this book. I've done 1 set each day and memorized 3 pages of word list each day. I've done this for 2 months and BAM my SAT Score accelerated. Thank you Kaplan. By buying this book, you're buying youself an IVY glory or the college u want to get into."
1,Wow! I bet Harrison Ford regrest this one! :oP,"What a sad disappointment! :( This movie is a choppy, poorly edited made-for-TV movie with a terrible video and audio transfer, and even more disturbing, it seemed to end abruptly with no resolution to any of the various storylines in the movie.I have not read the book that this movie is based one, but it just has to be better than this sorry adaption! :(Despite the extremely low price of this DVD, it is still a complete waste of money, not to mention time! :o{ Characters you never get to know with motives you never understand, storylines that are never resolved, and an amazingly anticlimatic ending all add up to a big ""0"" for this DVD! :o(Oh, and just in case you're a Harrison Ford fan, his part in this movie is so small that he is listed in the credits under ""supporting players."" ""Dynasty"" is *not* a Harrison Ford movie!!James Michner's Dynasty is the kind of made-for-TV movie that gives made-for-TV movies a bad name! :oP"
3,Could Have Been Better.,"Deception, envy, and greed divide the Blackwoods, a powerful Ohio family. Whose land-rich empire grows to dramatic proportions despite a soap opera of sibling rivalry. The script could have had more depth, and it ended in a flat, incomplete manner. Far too many loose ends. Despite this flaw I give it 3 stars because Sarah Miles and Stacey Keach were good."
2,Where's part two?,"I pretty much agree with the previous review. Typical of a mid to late 70's era TV mini-series. The video and audio is of 70's quality, the DVD is without subtitles or closed captioning.The direction is similar to Roots, or The Blue and the Gray type mini series, but Dynasty ends abruptly, without story resolution. Without sequels it makes no sense. This ""part 1"" develops the characters well, and provides a good foundation for plots, but it leaves you hanging. Like WTF???Sarah Miles gives an outstanding performance and carries the story, which is why I give it two stars. The other performances are somewhat ""choppy"" as the other previewer noted.As is... it is quite a mess."
1,I Want to talk to SAMMS2,"Sammm, or whatever. i need to set you straight about a few things. get in contact with me quick. you miss the point more times than one would think possible."
5,Great shampoo,"So Ive been using this shampoo for a while now, and I Love it, part from just switching up shampoos now and a again, I will not use another. I have biracial, sun damaged hair. I work and live on the ocean. This shampoo smells wonderful and removes the residue from my hair like no other! Along with this shampoo I use an Aveda Conditioner, as I do not like using the entire line of any product(i feel like this can do more damage, because of the repetitive ingredients). You cannot however just use this shampoo, because like i said, it removes residue(being made for horses, its amazing at cleaning), the hair does feel like straw after using,therefore you need a really good moisturizing conditioner. Aveda and Garnier Fructis work well with this shampoo. Amazing product. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants clean hair!"
4,Works best for pets,Does this dog shampoo make your dog's hair grow fast or slow cause i have heard that it does and that it dosnt? And i only bought it to make my hair grow fast for homecoming. Works best for pets.
3,GOOD,"It leaves your hair soft & shiny with lots of body. This will make your hair prettier and fuller than it's ever been before, really happy. Product is good."
3,So-so experience,"I bought both the shampoo and conditioner because I am trying to grow my hair out. I have used this product before for the same reason and decided to give it a second try. I have been using both on a daily basis for about a month now, and have formed a so-so opinion on it. My hair does appear thicker after using Mane 'n Tail, but my hair isn't as silky and smooth as it used to be. I noticed that my hair is harder to brush and it gets knotted much faster. However, I think my hair is growing faster than it used to. My hair grows very slowly, and I noticed about a half inch increase in my hair length after using this product. If you are looking to grow your hair, I would highly recommend this product. If you are just looking for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, then I would advise not to buy this product. My hair is far less manageable."
2,"Product seems alright, shipping NOT OKAY AT ALL.","This product smells great and seems to really make your hair soft. I used it only once but I'm not sure just how well it works just yet. I'll update in a month or two to share! What my review is about now is the messiest most dirty shipping I have EVER handled in my history of buying off of Amazon. First of all, I ordered this shampoo on February 19, and it got to me March 3rd when it said the latest it'd get to me was February 29h. Secondly, when I received the package I realized it smelled, not bad, but it smelled like soap/shampoo. The bottle EXPLODED in the box, the cap came off of the bottle, and more than HALF of the shampoo is GONE. Not knowing it exploded i opened it and all of the shampoo got on me. I would return it but I don't have the time or the car to get to the post office and send it back. I'm extremely disappointed and I'll never be buying this from here again. From now on, I'm going to the store or I'll by from Sally Hansen online."
2,just started,iknow i given it 2 stars for now its gonna change soon. My brother who uses it for about 2 months now and oh boy his hair is so thick the residing hairline has gone.
1,Anybody?,"IGNORE THE RATING.Does anyone know if this product strips color from your hair? I ordered it, but haven't received or used it, yet. But I plan on getting color soon, so I don't want to use it if it's going to strip it."
4,God Bless the Late Ron Winans,"I am grateful to God that he allowed Ron Winans to record one last family and friends album before he passed away on June 17, 2005. This cd is a little raw on the production side, but the songs are from the heart of Ron Winans. My favorites are :Can't help but love him; My Help; I made a promise to you; Salvation is Free and I shall not die, but live. All of these songs are a testimony of God's greatness and how he works wonders in the lives of beleivers. God may have taken Ron away from us, but you can listen to his testimony through song. Buy this album!"
3,Ron Winans,"I enjoy the songs and messages on this album. Many may think Ron doesn't sing like BeBe or CeCe, but Ron had a message. This album is truly a good way to remember him."
4,A great way to practice your swing....and more.,"I just bought this game for me, and I really like it, it make me think a lot about my real golf profile, Iam and will allways be an amateur golf player and think this is a good metodology to review my style, swing, clubs choice and more."
4,Good read!,"This was a good, romantic novel. If you like Diana Hamilton, Lynne Graham, Jane Porter, Michelle Reid, etc. books with strong Alpha Male characters, then you will love this one!! The hero and the heroine meet again after she secretly has his baby. They were separated because she found out he was engaged and his fiance set her up to look like she stole jewelry. Of course, he believed the evil fiance & cast the poor heroine out of his life so that she was forced to have the baby she conceived without his knowledge alone. Read it to see how he finds out he was wrong, gets the heroine to forgive him, etc., etc."
4,One of the best works I've ever heard.,"Even being a brazilian Caetano's fan, and used to appreciate his songs in Portuguese, it was a pretty nice surprise to know his wonderful performance in Spanish. As they use to say ""one artist is always an artist, no matter the language""."
5,Books by David Ramus,"I just finished ""Gravity of Shadows"". I have now read all three of David's books and ALL are wonderfully written and very suspenseful. I knew David in his other life and had no idea he was such a fine writer or even a writer at all. I cannot wait for his fourth. I hope there will be one and I wish him well."
4,A fun read,The entire series was very good. Kevin J Anderson is one of favorite fantasy/sci-fi authors. If you enjoy the fantasy genre then this book is for you.
5,A truly landmark contribution,"This book was inspirational and a real breakthrough in my understanding and relationship with my faith. It was the first occasion that an orthodox scholar refused to close the gates of inquiry, and maintains that Islam mandate these gates remain open allowing in questions and solutions sensitive to particular societies; it claims that the Quran requires particularity and not immanence in realising what is a Muslim way of life and refuses to yield to the sheer weight of orthodoxy. Fazlur Rahman is brave and determined not to let the ideologues, the obedience automatons from hijacking the wonderful Message. This is despite the fact that one may critique his theory in Chapter One (also included in Kauzmann's Liberal Islam anthology); his other book 'Islam' is also an inspiring read."
3,Good beginning book on volume,"This is a good book on volume if you are just getting started. He goes over how to spot accumulation and distribution in detail. However, you can tell that this information has been copied in so many other books on price and volume action of a stock. So if you have a good understanding on volume then I wouldn't buy this book. I bought this book on the recommendation of IBD and after reading I didn't learn that much. I would buy How to Make Money in Stocks if you don't already have it, instead of this book."
2,Fair,"If you already have a book on volume, you can skip this one.I bought this because I saw the good reviews on it.Maybe because the book was written in 1931. A lot of information in this book is already available on the internet or other books on volume.Basic stuff."
4,Tape reading and Market Tactics,Old time tape reading described in a text written in the 40's that proves basic price/volume relationships still apply. Good reading.
5,Barbers Blues,I have no fault with the seller. MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE QUALITY CONTROL THAT ROUNDER EXERCISED IN PRODUCING THIS ALBUM!!! I purchased 3 copies of this album; NONE OF THEM would play flawlessly to completion! I contacted Rounder about the problem; they did not have an explanation or offer to send a flawless copy of this album.
2,boot tears easy,used on 6-speed stock transmission. fitted correctly. look good. but after a couple of months the boot split. the rubber is of poor quality
2,Wrong dimensions,"Size listed was not correct so this did not work for me. The actual size is 5 1/2"" in diameter."
3,A nice introduction to seasons,"this board book is a nice introduction to the seasons; the photographs are vivid and interesting. I only wish there was a little text, helping parents explain the differences between the seasons. Still, my two year old likes this book a lot."
4,These gals got game!,"""You Don't Know Nothin' About Love"" alone makes this album worth picking up, but there's plenty more in this collaboration. Irma Thomas can still bring it, and Tracy Nelson could knock down a wall with her great pipes. Marcia Ball lends her sly, laid back vocals to the mix."
3,Tracy and Irma great combo.,"This was the first I have ever heard of any of these ladies. Tracy and Irma stand out and You don't know nothin'about love, is the most powerful piece on the cd. Tracy is heard all over this cd with power force and beauty. I enjoy her thoroughly and will look for some of her solo stuff in the future. She crosses between gospel and blues with authority and passion. The highlight of this cd is the last song You don't know nothin' about love Great song"
5,a refreshing new approach in New Orleans Jazz.,"Exquisite arrangements, delicious brass interludes and most powerfull solo's. Can!t wait till they come over to Europe on a tour."
4,"Helpful, but with some drawbacks","Despite the previous reviews, I actually found this book to be very helpful. It gave me a much better feel for the schools that I was looking at applying to, which is more than I can say for the endless dry statistics found in other books.Two drawbacks, though. 1)Many schools were not covered in this book. 2)In some of the articles, the information seemed outdated.Other than that, a pretty good guide to law schools."
2,Believe us -- precisely the same as the 5th edition!,"I didn't believe the earlier writer who suggested it wasn't worth purchasing this book if you had already read the 5th edition; I wish I had. This edition is exactly the same as the earlier version - same phrases, same schools (do you know, it only has 112 of 179 ABA approved law schools featured?). If you're thinking about buying this book, I would recommend that you go to the library instead and read whichever version they happen to have on hand, even if it dates back to the early 90s. On the other hand, if you don't know anything about the reputation of particular schools, this book can be helpful in giving you a snapshot view. If you do know something about the reputation of certain schools, you may find, as I did, that this book is more of a confirmation of everything else I had heard/read about those schools -- it didn't seem to offer any fresh insights."
5,Inside the Law Schools: A Guide by Students for Students,Excellent resource for applying to law school; helped me narrow my scope; saved time applying to schools that would be a good match for me. Highly recommended.
3,not specific to the Nissan Pathfinder,"The item arrived quickly, but the quality appears a bit poor. It was also definitely not specific to the Pathfinder; some work had to be done to get it to work on the vehicle."
5,Pete Puma is here!! You won't find him anywhere else!!,"Pete Puma, Evil Scientist with an ""interesting Monster"", Bruno the bear with his rabbit Parrtnnar, every one of these is a classic you need for your collection."
4,lots of great cartoons,I was looking for one cartoon. I found the one plus quite a few more that i loved as a child and still do now i was surprised to find them on this tape. I'm sure anyone would love this tape lots of great cartoons.
3,"OK, with little solid information on the turnaround.","I had hoped that the book would conver in more detail what was done to bring the airline back from the brink. Yes, we get a lot of soft shoe ""we did it as a team"", and ""we just got honest"" stories, but little in the way of how a company with the terrible internal problems Continental had was able to turn employee morale around enough to salvage the wreck. At the time I witnessed what was going on at the airline, violence between mamangement & labor wasn't only threatened, but was expected. Painting planes & paying everyone $65 a month for on-time doesn't change that. I agree with an earlier reviwer- read Jan Carlzons book for a better overview of saving an airline."
4,"Motivational, in the best sense of the word","Being one of the many customers turned off to Continental Airlines during the Frank Lorenzo years, I was interested in reading about how people today can call them one of the best. Once again, the formula turns out to be simple: ignore the stock traders, and concentrate on your customers and employees. Keep them happy, within the bounds of financial sanity, and the profits will follow naturally. A well-written book with lots of solid examples. Mr Bethune, however, comes across as very much filled with his own importance -- although he repeatedly makes the point that he is replaceable -- and doesn't give enough credit to the subordinates that worked hard to carry out his ideas."
2,From worst to First to Very Boring!!,"I am sure that what Gordon Bethune has done for Continental is truly worth a great deal of appreciation. However, the account given in this book fails to describe the turnaround process at Continental in an exciting and informational way. It is too repetitive. I think that I understand when a person says that ""the employees hated Continental"" after I read that five times, but to mention that in every second paragraph is unnecessary. What Bethune fails to give us is interesting incidents where he actually used the strategies that he employed. Although the ""Go Forward Plan"" has been broken into four parts, each part somehow connects to something else in the middle of the section and talks about something not concerning that section at all. But above all, if the Continental employees contributed to buy Bethune a Harley Davidson, it shows that he did an incredible job at Continental. So, maybe he should stick to fixing airlines and leave the writing to someone else."
1,This could have been a great book!,"This book was way to Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive. Because of the anoyance of reading the same thing over and over again I had to quit the book at page 150. We know Continental was bad and the customers hated the airline, but the reader does not need to be reminded of this 3-4 times in each chapter."
4,"A good story, well told","Bethune makes it clear that a company turnaround requires a lot more than closing facilitities and firing employees (Take that, Chainsaw Al!). It requires a comprehensive plan that includes getting your finances in order, treating your customers right but first treating your employees like valued partners, admitting your mistakes, communicating about everything, involving employees, customers and distributors (e.g., travel agents) in the change process and being willing to make hard choices. The book tells us how Continental did it and those of us who are frequent flyers notice the difference. The main criticism of the book is that it is repetitive, too full of homey stories and a just a bit self-congratulatory (although he is justifibly proud). Our business book club, composed of senior-level human resources professionals, liked the book."
3,It's a very simple book...but maybe that's the point.,"Mr Bethune and his ghost-writer follow the oldest training guide: ""1. Tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em, 2. Tell 'em, 3. Tell 'em what you told 'em.""So it can seem repetitive at times. And, it can certainly seem simplistic (I suppose it could even seem painful if you're an MBA). However, if you step back and think about it, ""simple"" may just be the message. Not that the job of managing an airline isn't complex. But the solutions to problems can be so complex as to get in their own way. So, if you stay with it and pick out the pearls, you can have a nice simple list of management prescriptions. Simple in their statement, but often difficult in their execution. Which is probably where Bethune is different. He didn't just talk about, he did it."
4,An inspiration for today's business leaders,"Gordon Bethune, a very confident man - you may find him cocky, gives us insights on how he made it possible to turn a major organization around through the management of people, not the management of the company. Definite reading material for anyone who manages people; sales, division, corporate, etc. managers.Note: You may find a few chapters a bit of fluff (bragging about himself)."
3,Good information but written at 4th-grade level,"I got tired of being told to remember what I'd already been told. This book would be much more effective if it treated the readers like adults and cut all the repetition. I'm a fan of leadership stories, and would have liked some factual illustrations of his actions, instead of so much about how good he thinks he is. It was necessary to wade through the excess to get the highlights. I also wanted to hear more about his military leadership experiences."
3,Interesting but very repetitious,"With broad brush strokes Gordon lays out how he got Continental firing on all cylinders through his Product, Marketing, Funding, People plans. The book is worth reading for his approach to those issues. However, what could have been communicated in 100 pages takes 282 because of the heavy repetition."
4,Great read for business people,"I have been a loyal frequent flyer at Continental since the late 90's, and I have no idea the airlines was that terrible at the early 90's. As a frequent flyer, I admire Continental's plane is always cleaner than other airlines, and the flight attendant attitude is always friendly than others. After reading the book, I understand the reasons.If you work at a company need to be turned around, this book is almost a top read. For management, there are some good ideas worth considering from reading this book.This book can be condensed to 2/3. The last one third of the book is somewhat repeating what has been said at the beginning. Otherwise I will give it a 5 stars rating."
3,Hammering in what everyone knows,Gordon Bethune certainly turned around Continental by using common logic and Management techniques. What is not clear is how did Continental slip to such depths before and also what are the Challenges that still need to be overcome ? The book is interesting but one tends to jump pages since there is a lot of repetition. All the same it is a good book for it does hammer in that PEOPLE COUNT and one cannot ignore that.
4,A must read,"My brother who works for another airline recommended this book. I don't follow the industry so I'd never heard of Gordon Bethune, but I have now! Every leader should take the time to travel with and steal priceless leadership nuggets from Gordon as he took Continental airline from worst to first."
1,He did nothing that any competent CEO would do.,"Though the book is written in plain english with his blunt demeanor and self grandiose, he does not lay down the foundation of how he accomplished the turnaround. The Go Forward Plan that was the foundation to the turn-around was somewhat uninspiring. Today's CEOs know that you have to look internally to understand your companies situation. This is nothing new. Anyone can rally the troops."
2,very poorly written,"the book is written in a style which mixes chronology with agenda points the author wants to make. it is difficult to follow, and a lot of the points are so general that it is difficult to relate them to a specific action the ceo (or the airline executives) took.having read this book twice now, i am at a loss to explain what this ceo really did, but maybe this is just me not knowing in general what ceos do."
5,airline comeback,"My son,who this book this was purchased for, really appreciates it, since it was on the list for his birthday as well as the one titled, ""Aerodynamics-Naval Aviation""."
3,Good Decision,I bought two of these to go with the external charger I purchased on Amazon. They seem to function as they should although the delivery was a little delinquent. All in all much cheaper than buying them from the Verizon store.
1,New battery behaves like used one,I bought a new battery but it is behaving like a used battery. The battery live does not last more than 2 days when not in use.
3,Review for the Blackberry battery,"I recieved the package well on time, however when i recieved - it was rather small in size and unlike the Black berry original 8820 battery. In any case - Its not much of a hazzle - the battery still works with my bb 8820.Thanks"
1,used?,received battery and gave it a full charge as if new. The charge only lasted for about 4-6 hours. Contacted amazon and they sent another one. The new one only lasted for about a few hours longer. Wasn't very happy with the product but the phone was only temporary. Definitely not a good battery for the long term.
1,Not a new battery,The battery came and it was obviously not a new battery as advertised. If I paid more than a few bucks - I would send it back.
2,Not quite new,"I bought this product as a new item.It is obviously not new, it was actually in much worse shape the my original battery that is over a year old...However, it charges ok and I haven't had any problems with the battery holding a decent charge level.I am not dissatisfied enough to return the battery, but I paid for a ""New"" Item and was given one that has seen extensive use, the contacts had visible wear, the green covering on the battery was ripped, the battery had scratches acrossed the surface like it had been thrown in a box with metal objects and sat there for a while..."
2,Battery life,I am not sure if I missed something but I may have been given a used battery. Initially the battery life had a good 2 days of normal usage but yesterday I took my phone off the charger around 5 pm and this morning when I woke up at 6 am it was almost dead. I made one short call and had a few text messages so I am not sure why now after a week and a half of using it that it wont last a full day.
4,Stock battery works as expected,"Works just like the one that comes with the 8800, 'cause it *is* the one that comes with the 8800. It would be nice if it had a higher power density (which is achievable using current technology) so that the 8800 would last a bit longer between charges. High capacity batteries are available (sadly, not at Amazon) but make the 8800 thicker with the included replacement back shell."
1,Used Battery,"I specifically clicked on the ""new"" battery to purchase. I received the 1st battery and it was dead. Called the company without hesitation they said they would send out another. Waited another 5 days and when the next battery came in it was dead as well! I then thought it must have been the phone - I bought a new phone and took that new battery to test in my old phone. You guessed it - Worked fine! So because these guys sent out 2 bad batteries I ended up buying a new phone. Now I have 2 good phones and 1 good battery. I would recommend NOT buying a battery from this company."
1,Not OEM product,"Given the variance in reviews, at best, I'd say this is an unreliable product. (I saw the mixed reviews before ordering, but figured ""they couldn't be that bad."")First of all, the battery was NOT a BB battery -- not as pictured nor made in Japan (it was plain silver and made in China).The battery I received wouldn't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours. I sent an e-mail complaint; was told that sometimes a given battery won't be up to snuff; and they would exchange. The second battery lasted a little longer but not even 24 hours. I gave up. I had made a bad bet. I just didn't want to bother with them any more. I used it for a couple of months -- having to charge it once or twice a day. It declined steadily and finally flat-lined this week. Ironically, I'm now using my old battery which seems brilliant compared to my recent experiences.Maybe you'll get lucky, but the odds are against you."
2,You get what USED pay for...,"A few other reviewers tried to warn me the same way but I went for it anyway. Contrary to the listing as a NEW battery, this was a used battery that performed the same as the 2 year old battery that came with my Blackberry 8830 World Edition. After 2 years, it holds a charge for about 1 day.Save your money and the hassles. Then go to a chain or big box store and hand over the cash for a (real) new battery."
2,Battery is not New,"When I bought my blackberry, my battery lasted for 2 days of intensive use. It went like that for a full year and then in a matter of a week or two my battery life halved, I could only get a day out of it of not so quite an intensive use. I was delighted to see that Amazon offered a new battery at what seemed a very attractive price, in comparison with what a cell store would charge. However, after using this battery that I purchased from amazon I get the same sort of medium sized day that I get with my old battery. This leads me to conclude that the vendor is recycling used batteries as new ones. It is cheap, but it is not new. If you don't have a battery at all get it. If you want to replace your old battery pay the $40 at a cell store and get the really new one."
1,garbage,"Battery was purchased from OEM Planet. The first battery delivered was clearly used. The contacts showed excessive wear(worse than the original battery that is 3+ years old). The green sticker/label/wrapper was severely damaged and scatched through. Worse yet, the white indicator(for water exposure) had a red strip. I contacted the seller for a replacement, indicating that I wanted a new battery as advertised, and not a used one like they had provided. The replacement battery was delivered promptly. However, it too was used, but not damaged. My experience is very similar to that of other reviewers. $5 buys a used battery, not a new one. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again."
3,"Battery is fine, but shipping took a long time!","It was well over two weeks before the battery was even put in the mail to get sent to me. I had ordered another item at the same time that came from a different vendor, that was in my mailbox in two days. This one took almost 3 weeks."
2,"Worth the $5, but not much else","The battery worked fine, for a while. But within a month of purchase the connection plate quite literally split off from the battery and rendered it useless. Granted I use two batteries (to allow complete discharge/recharge cycling) so they're pulled in and out of my phone often, but the original battery is still going strong and this one fell apart.Truth be told I probably got my money's worth out of this battery and you probably will to, but don't expect that $5 to get you very far."
5,Blackberry 8830 battery,Works great - seems to hold a charge longer than the original which came with the smartphone. Vendor was super-quick.
5,Excellent quality CD as expected from Verve,"This is another excellent quality sounding CD from Verve, and appropriately for Louis Armstrong, he is #1 in the Verve Jazz Masters series! This CD is highly recommended for purchase by anyone who loves Satchmo's playing and unique singing style."
5,The Goodman jazz orchestra at its best!,"If you can get only one Benny Goodman big group recording, this is it. With some songs from the 40th Anniversary Carnegie Hall concert and others from European concert dates in the '70's, this albums shows that Goodman was the king of collecting great talent and keeping it jumping. Classic versions of ""Stealin' Apples"",""Lady Be Good"", ""A Smooth One"" and, the star of the lot, ""Roll ""Em"", will have you dancing in your living room. Great guest appearances by Lionel Hampton and Mary Lou Williams. Swing at its best and jazziest."
2,So-So product,"The quality of the bands are so-so. A few of them snapped on me when doing exercises a few months after using them. After having one snap me in the hand and break the skin, I decided a review was necessary.I also really dislike the workout DVD that comes with it. It's 6 minutes long. You can't get a good workout in 6 minutes.. so, it's essentially a worthless addition to this."
2,Not bad if they fit,"These things are way too tight. They didn't tear when I put them on, so they're pretty durable. Too bad I couldn't keep it on long enough to give it a proper test.I'm sticking with the Helmet XLs from now on. Too bad Amazon doesn't carry them."
5,Good book,"This was an excellent book for the first two weeks of Summer SVMS has to do work experience. Jessica, Elizabeth, Bruce Patman and Melissa McCormick end up at the zoo. Elizabeth put Jess's name in the thing to get to the zoo and 4 people got drawed (see above) Jess didnt want to work at the zoo. She gets assigned to the bears. When a mother bear is brought in she dies and her cub falls in love with Jess and vice versa. Jess hides the cub in her room when she is told the cub has to be relesed back into the woods. Liz has a monkey it gets lose in Casey's. Bruce and Melissa work with the birds a baby bird is born and the first living thing it sees is Bruce so it thinks Bruce its its mother. Bruce is scared of birds"
3,working at the zoo,"The book was okay.But it was also quite interesting.Elizabeth,who was excited about working at the zoo,wasn;t having such a great time.But Jessica,that didn't even want to work at the zoo in the first place loved working with the bears later on.But the book itself was alright,even though it was sad at the end."
4,Amazing and Fun..!,"Having all of the Bears CD's and piles of Belew work and some Psychodots too... I'm excited to say ""This is a great CD""I enjoy it more than any of their previous discs (shy of their first one)The guitar work is as good as anything they've done (ever) and the band plays this collection of members solo tracks at perfect tempo's with fabulous grooves...A worthy CD far better than the limited recognition it will recieve..."
1,Not For Me,"I had to buy this book for a class that I hated and almost couldn't force myself to read it. I had such a hard time with it and found it incredibly boring and confusing. I would never read this book for fun. Unfortunately it does talk about a lot about important things and I could sound like an educated person if I had read it but I just can't understand it. Maybe when I'm over 50 I'll be more interested since I might have a genuine interest in what the book talks about, instead of being forced to read it for a class that I hated so much."
5,Classic of Economics,"This book is the seed of modern understandings of economics and therefore the key to unlocking the uncertainties of 18th century economic life to the degree that the world has reached unseen wealth at the present. I think there is a strong connection between the influence of this one book and the relative wealth of today's world 100 years later. Although much of the theories in this book are outdated, especially when it comes to international economics, there is still much in this book to be studied. For that reason, I think it is worth reading by all."
4,"Interesting, but a struggle to get through","This book is the classic bible of capitalism and it explains the mindsets of advocates of free-trade perfectly. It gives a clear, proper - though sometimes a bit long - explanation of the laws of the market and exposes the logical workings of the ""invisible hand"". However, as it was written for its own time, it refers tocontemporary events, people and nation-states, and that makes it hard for anyone but a history buff to understand many of Smith's points. Outdated and mutated words appear on almost every page and adds to this complicating It seems as if Smith's text was left completely intact. The book is also very long - almost 600 pages - and at times it relatively dull. For these flaws I felt it necessary to remove one star. However, the book deserves the other four stars for its remarkable clarity in destroying socialist arguments for the conscious ability of humanity to put the interest of the group ahead of their own."
1,Watch Out!,"I have no criticism with Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations."" My criticism is with the Great Minds Series edition of the book. The Great Minds Series is an abridged version. Huge chunks have been edited out of the book, yet nowhere do they let you know this before making the purchase. I bought this book specifically because I wanted to cite it, and I can't because the parts I wanted to quote have been edited out.Adam Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"" is a worthy book for any private library, but purchase an edition other than the one offered by the so-called ""Great Minds Series."""
1,Everyman's Library edition is also ABRIDGED!!!!,"Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff."
3,"Great prose, but....","This is a great book with much valuable insight and advise that ought to be heeded 200+ years after being laid on paper. My only concern is in this rendition of the book someone has becomes sloppy. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors which appear to have been caused by a computer misreading characters on a scanned document. For all of Amazon's clout, I am amazed they would butcher such a classic. Anyone with an 8th grade education could proof read and correct 95% of these errors. Great book, it's just a shame it came out like this."
5,Great,"This book is huge!!! The pages are so thin, the writing is so small, it's hard to read. Despite all this if you are interested in Economics, this won't be an impediment in ordering this book.Go for it, Adams Smith is the best."
2,"rating the actual book, not its wonderful content","This huge, collector's edition is HEAVY, the font is small, and there is a ridiculous amount of margin area for writing. I take copious notes, but this is even too much for me. So in effect, you buy this supposedly beautifuly collector's edition, but it's shiny paper back - what's so great about it? Nothing. I'm not even sure why it costs so much. I've seen numerous errors in spelling. The value doesn't equal what you pay for it. Go for the lighter editions, unless, like other reviewers, you buy this merely to sit on your shelf to impress people (or yourself).As for the book, Adam Smith is thorough, it's hard work to get through it, but his principles are sound and when left to work without government regulation, the precepts taught therein work beautifully. Smith gets five stars. The Premium Edition is lucky to get two."
3,The Great Work of a Great Mind.,"Although this book is hailed as one of the greatest works in Economics ever and set the foundations for contemporary Economic thought, the Wealth of Nations is not a good read. It is extremely difficult to digest and requires extreme concentration. Few would read the book unless required in an Economics course or the like. Smith was undoubtedly a genius - way ahead of his time. However, the reader must have as great an intellect to fully comprehend what Smith is writing. Perhaps ""user-friendly"" books were not the fashion of the times."
5,Timeless Classic,"I think that recent developments in politics and the world economy have, in my judgement, vindicated many claims of Adam Smith's that have thus far been a matter of debate. Of course, this is a controversial claim and to substantiate it I should of course cite evidence, however, this book is highly readable and if you choose to read it, you will not regret a moment spent in its pages. I think that you will also find that you will understand many political and economic problems much better once you have read and re-read Adam Smith's gargantuan tome."
4,a classic,Not a light read and you have to wrestle with archaic English grammar but a classic that should be part of everyone's library.
3,Great to know but a burden to read,Not even Miami Beach could make me enjoy reading this book.This book is over 200 years old and the economic system has changed a lot since then. So why should you read it then? Because most economic fundamentals are being described in this book and give you great insight in understanding the current market more. Let's just hope they don't connect Wall Street to the price of grain anymore.It's a classic. It's a must read for economic studies. But it's a burden for the common man with his feet in the sand.
4,Great edition beware it is edited,"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith. What I can say is that this book is a book that has been edited. If you are looking for a specific comment or quote you may not find the exact representation in this book. While this book isn't missing anything, wordages have been changed, be aware of this. The typeset is in an old fashioned type setting and does add a bit of charm to the book. I disliked that the book did not note that it wasn't the original text, for that reason I give it a 4."
4,For Kindle format,"It is a great classic book, no question.The only thing is that--I wish the table of content link is better in the kindle format. For some reasons, the later links of the chapters do not work quite well. Hope there will be an improvement."
5,Essential reading,"What are the essential relationships among work, money, property, services? Find out with certainty with this book that will give you a great grounding in the arena of economics and allow you to know why capitalism works and communism doesn't."
2,Kindle edition has no links,"The Kindle edition has NO hyperlinks in the document. It gets better.When you search on the word ""chapter,"" none of the chapter beginnings are found, supposedly because the chapter heading is an IMAGE, not text.I'll try other editions, and if needed, a download from Mobi, and report back on whether I can find a version of this book that can be used with a linked Table of Contents."
2,Beware: NO 5th BOOK!,"The Everyman's Library version is abridged -- without being advertised as so, either on Amazon OR anywhere inside the book!The Wealth of Nations is a pivotal work in the history of economics and human nature, but you'd be better off finding an edition that includes the entire work.The Wealth of Nations (Everyman's Library)"
2,Small Print,I was unable to read the book because the print in the book was very small.Very disappointed but will look for a different version or publisher.
4,not bad,"while there are a few tpyos here and there, the text is both readable and compelling. I'm not finished by any means, but so far, so good!"
4,Wealth of Nations,Reading these pages gave me a better understanding of economics. This publication was a good reference in my research during my recent economics class.
1,The Unknown Adam Smith - A suppliment to other reviews.,"A short note for those about to enter into the world of Adam Smith - Take time to examine Book V, parts I-III. You'll notice that Smith, quite contrary to his Laisse-faire proponants, is elucidating the beginnings of Keynes, rather than the Milton Freeman view. ""The duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works, which...[are] of such a nature, that the profit could never repay the expanse to any individual or small number of individuals, and which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or small number of individuals should erect or maintain."" (Smith, Adam The Wealth of Nations, pg. 681)"
1,Tedious,"Where is this guy buried so I can dig him up and slap him? This is the most tedious book I have ever tried to read. Adam Obfuscation Smith apparently lived by the philosophy ""if you can say it clearly in 10 words, then say it opaquely in 30"". Every Economist & Politician you see today must have learned that art from him. He went to Oxford, enough said really. Git. Not sure what the book is about. Something to do with Economics. Absolutely positive the author was a wanker."
2,Kinda not what i thought it was...,"I keep trying to pick these things up hoping they're gonna either come in via osmosis, or figure if i can learn something. This one just didn't do it for me, it confused me!"
3,"Excellent work, mediocre package","Extremely interesting at parts, but incredibly boring at others. It was probably riveting when it was written. This edition comes in a book which is almost shaped like a cube, it must be held open with care, annoying."
1,Avoid this Edition,"Book comes riddled with typos, errors, etc. Don't save yourself a few dollars by going with a cheap(er) edition."
2,Adam Smith: Wealth of nations,"This version is just too small for such a great book. No room to write interpretations or other side notes. Bought another one, so it has become my door stop for now; until someone offers me a price or simply asks to borrow it."
2,"Great work, avoid this edition.","The Wealth of the Nations is an outstanding work of one of the most important men of the social sciences, the father of economics, Adam Smith.Although the full work is included in this book, including the often forgotten last two books of the Wealth of Nations, this edition has no introduction, and its table of contents has numbers pointing to the wrong pages. In addition, this edition makes the book too large and thus very uncomfortable for the reader to hold while reading.I highly suggest reading the Wealth of Nations, but I also strongly suggest to avoid this edition. Prefer the Bantam Classics edition."
1,Smith for Socialists,"Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this. This, the Modern Library edition, contains an introduction and footnotes that essentially amount to Adam Smith as interpreted by 20th century socialists -- placing Smith and Karl Marx at the same level in the pantheon of social thinkers. (One can imagine that the Modern Library may continue the trend and subsequently publish an edition of the Federalist Papers in which Madison is compared with Pol Pot.)If you wish to understand Smith, avoid this edition. If, however you want to gain a muddled perspective on The Wealth of Nations, go no further."
3,Decent bluesy rock and roll,"What critics of George Thorogood and similar musicians fail to realize or acknowledge is that he has helped introduce people to the blues and roots rock and roll. It's not his fault that these original masters like Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, etc. have been ignored or underappreciated for their contributions. After listening to Thorogood myself, I was more inclined to investigate and listen to those great original masters of the genre. In this way, Thorogood has done these artists a service by bringing their music to the forefront. He has also acknowledged their contributions publicly. Those who level criticism against Thorogood must then be critical of any white artist who derives influence from the blues or black American music. Anyway, the album is one of Thorogood and the Destroyers' more varied releases."
5,Great from start to finish,These early Rounder recordings are great... the best stuff he ever did. He became a bit of a joke later on but back then this guy was just straight up one of the best players in town and had great taste in material. His own writing never matched the work he did covering the songs he loved. You need this one and Move It On Over for sure...
1,There's nothing original about George...,"I have submitted my review already.... but please don't print it if you feel it's too mean or spiteful..... Just 'cause I don't care for George, that won't change nothin' really.... I just needed to vent a little."
2,A more conceptual look at uncluttering,"Not to be a grinch, but I would like to underline that this is a book of ESSAYS and rather simple advice often found in organizing articles and books. The essays are gently humorous or insightful, as you will see from glancing around in the book (function above), and the writing is nice enough. But answers to real quandaries are best found in other books, for example the surprisingly good ""Conquering Chronic Disorganization"" by Judith Kolberg."
5,Everything I expected,"I learned that you cannot skimp on a good anemometer. I decided that this product line was the best (still think so), and I went for the bottom model of the top-line series. I never plan to store data, but maybe it will be useful someday. Wind readings seem to be good down to about 1 kt, well below what is of consideration. I originally purchased for winds during sailing, but I may start using it more like a weather station, on and off the boat. You won't be sorry if you feel that you can afford it."
1,old technology,"Yes, the Kestrel is great - if all you want to do is look at the weather data. Downloading the data is only easy if you have an old computer. The Kestrel interface requires either a serial port (most laptops don't have them anymore) or you can buy their ""USB"" kit, which is really just a Keyspan adapter added to the old-style serial connector. The problem is that your computer must have one of the COM1 through COM4 ports unassigned for this to work. If you don't have an old-style serial port, you will probably find that your USB has assigned COM ports up to 5 or 6 already."
4,A classic series,Grew up watching these movies on TV with my father who was a trucker himself. A convient combo that has all three movies. Only con would be the lack of DVD extras or features :(
3,Just what you'd expect...,"O.K., here goes. The first one was great, the second one was almost o.k., and the rest sucked. I was a great Jackie Gleason fan, and thought that he should have never gone beyond the second one, and he was pushing it at that. Old Burt and Sally knew better, i.e., when to quit. I'll have to truthfully say that I would buy the set again, if only for the first one, and possibly the second. I should note that I would have given this set five stars, but they included the rest of them....."
3,the set no one asked for,"this is proof that the studios have no clue as to what the public wants. i must say i loved the first ""smokey and the bandit"" and bought it when i found it on sale. as for the other two ""films"" and i use that term loosely, they are pure garbarge. smokey II is a crass atempt to cash in on the first and has no story and makes the people we liked in the first one so unlikeable that the movie is unwatchable. number III i will not ever talk about as it is beyond and stands as one of the 80's worst. the three stars is for the first film and no stars for the rest of this mess!!!!!!!!"
3,"If you're a fan, a bargain for the money","The original film is one of my all-time favorites and is also one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The second film was a disappointing follow-up, with The Bandit turning into an embittered egomaniac and some truly silly and dumb plot twists. For example, The Great One, Jackie Gleason, playing more than one role. I personally prefer the third film to the second, despite it being universally panned by most critics. I found the third film, while not in a league with the original, to be very funny, especially given that Jackie Gleason has more screentime than in the first two films. His scenes with his son, Junior, are the best things about the film. It was also, sadly, one of Gleason's last films. The only thing I don't like is the double-sided DVD. Other than that, despite no extras whatsoever, for Jackie Gleason and Smokey fans like me, it is still a bargain and is well-worth the money."
3,Sequels not worth buying,"I love the original Smokey and the Bandit, it is definitely worth five stars. The sequel is mediocre at best. The third film is really awful, and there is no Burt Reynolds in it! I should have bought just the original film, because this Pursuit Pack does not add anything to it."
1,Don't buy it! It freezes!,"I purchased the pursuit pack from Amazon and although the first movie plays fine, the second and third pause,and freeze, on my DVD player! Before you say that it's my equipment, I'm playing it on a top of the line $200.00+, a year ago, Sony DVD player. I've tried cleaning the disc, restarting it, etc. Only thing left to do is return it."
1,Smokey and the Bandit Pursuit Pack,"I ordered the 3 movie Pursuit Pack because it stated that all 3 movies were included. It was a birthday present, I paid additional fees to have it overnighted 2 days, it came in 5. Amazon did fix this immediately and resent another DVD asking me to wait until I received it to send the original one back. The 2nd one came the very next day but... it was just like the first. In it's original packaging yet only included sequels 2 and 3... sending it back and reordering the original alone..."
2,bad dvd,The box set consists of 3 dvd movies. The second dvd does not work...how can I exchange the bad dvd for a good dvd?
5,Smokey And thr bandit,"I Like The Movie Smokie and the bandit, and I like Having All 3 Movies On One Disk"
3,Defects Abound!,"I bought the first DVD and it had a flaw that would freeze the movie up. Amazon sent a replacement copy, same problem...seems the folks pressing the DVD in Mexico have made a big ol' batch of garbage DVD's, so I will not get a replacement copy. Hold on to your money and wait for a good run of DVDs', then you can watch a great car/entertainment movie, followed by a so-so one, and the b-side (3rd ""Smokey"" movie) can be used as a coaster for your soda."
4,Great Gift,This was a great Christmas gift for my husband he was very excited to get it from his son. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Packaging slightly defective,When I opened it up one of the clips that holds one of the DVDs in place was loose but no problem.
4,Affordable but flawed,"This is a good way to get all three Smokey and the Bandit films for viewing, or showing to the kids who don't have a clue about the classic car-chase movies of the 1970's.However-Some scenes seem to have been deleted - not the major ones, but minor interludes here and there. The average viewer won't notice it, but hard-core fans may be disappointed.The DVD has bugs in it - it locked up the DVD play once, and the only way to return to the main menu to go from one movie to the next seems to be ejecting the DVD and putting it back in. It gives the entire product a feeling that the film was around, and it was put together during a 'bring your kid to work' day - and this is what the kids were allowed to work on.Other than that - a good way to relive those car chases."
4,"Glad I found this DVD But,",This DVD is a must to have for a Smokie and the Bandit fan. I did find out my copy has a freeze up in part 2 and there is nothing wrong with the disk or my player. I did get lucky to find another copy in Big Lots store for $3.00 so alll did work out except I have to load another DVD in my player than just stay with the Persuit pack. The Original is still the best by far.2 was ok with the Elephant and the truck and cop car stunt seen.3 should be left out for a Why Bother trying.
4,1 and a 2 and a...3?,"Its a set of three. Of course 1 and 2 are real good ! Three is just sort of there. Its worth watching for the car wrecks and such, but not up to the first two. Burt Reynolds may have been burned out by then, hence his lack of appearance in three."
3,Classic Movies,"Product is exactly as it is described. You get all 3 Smokey and the Bandit movies on 2 discs. The first Smokey and the Bandit is the best and it just goes downhill from there. The second one is worse and the third movie is just down right awful. Burt Reynolds is not even in it. But 3 movies for $18, you really can't beat it. These are classic movies everyone should see."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased the DVD 'Smokey and the Bandit' brand new, and it came already scratched!! The last 45 minutes are unviewable. I will never again use or recommend Amazon."
3,Smokey (1) Great...Smokey (2) Fair....Smokey (3)...Why?,"This pack shouldn't have been. It would have been a lot better if they had put the original soundtrack CD in with Smokey and the Bandit(1). Why mess with perfection? Who's idea was it to come out with a 2 & 3? Jerry Reed's acting got worse. As a matter of fact if it wasn't for Jackie Gleason in 2 & 3 it would have been a total loss. Although I'd like to say thank you for not making any more. Like the Police Academy 2, 3, 4, 5,,,...."
2,Diehard fans wondering about the B-side???,"Well, if you missed this import single when it was released along with a handful more, you may fear you missed an Andy Bell gem. This track is a B-side for a reason. Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD. No, it's not an electro house dance track like much of what you'll find on the full length. It's a short, sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band, including acoustic drums, guitar, and even a horn section. If you simply MUST have everything Andy Bell sings, then you do get plenty of his vocal, but if you're really more just about his classic dance sound, then pass on it. Ashame they couldn't have just thrown it in as a bonus track on the domestic maxi-single release of Crazy."
2,read with caution,"Keeping it short and sweet, I've been throught Janov's therapy. They are all well intentioned, and believe in what they are doing (I hope). However Primal Therapy is very much similar to a cult, and this book, The Biology of Love, is another in a line of unscientific advertisment booklets."
1,Hype without Evidence,"Janov's work in the Biology of Love is unscientific diatribe. The main purpose of the book is to attract business to spend money on primal therapy. The monocausal trauma-centric model for psychopathology and the trauma-is-repressed theory make this therapy dangerous, and potentially cultic. There is danger of false memories, or just a general blackening of real memories - a negative re-evaluation of neutral memories that can cause relationship problems with one's family. Avoid primal-therapy writings and this therapy as if it were a cult."
2,Minimal fun.,"I bought this about a year ago at EB Games for about $3.00. I was hoping for a good old classic N64 game. Damn was I wrong.Graphics: 6/10. Bad framerate and the graphics are TRYING to be good but fail which makes for a crash fest into walls because the colors are blurred and it's really hard to tell where you're going.Sound: 5/10. Vroom...Vroom..SHIFT..Vroom..Vroom..SHIFT. You got the idea. You hear cars shifting gears and annoying wannabe techno like music in the background. So aggrivating it should be put on mute.Control: 5.5/10. The controls for the most part don't even respond. It is about a half second delay on any button press, and there is not any realism at all in this game.Fun: 5/10. What the hell were the creators thinking? Bland graphics, horrible gameplay, extremely unrealistic... so on. Even if you like racing games on the not-so-realistic side, this game still shouldn't be bought. This was a horrible game! In every way! You will not have fun! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!3.7/10"
3,AN S.F. RUSH RIPOFF 6.5 OUT OF 10,"I have no idea how Midway published this game despite the fact it's a ripoff of their other racer San Francisco Rush. While it is an overall okay game, it feels mundane and it needs work. The graphics need to be fixed because of frame rate and texturing problems. The controls need some tweaking because of some issues. The cars need to have crash-modeling and need more detail because they look a little bland and pixelated. What saves this game from being a disaster are the decent tracks, selection of vehicles, and good overall multiplayer. Still you're much better off playing Mario Kart, or if for some reason you don't like it (if you don't there is something very, very wrong with you), go play San Francisco Rush instead."
5,Eugalan Topfer Forte,"I had used Eugalan Topfer Forte in the past after having taken antibiotics. This product will help anyone recover from the damaging effects of antibiotic use. I had difficulty remembering the name of the product and local health food stores did not carry Eugalan Topfer. After several internet attempts trying to recall the name I found the product. This product is better than all other probiotics or yogurt that I have taken for this purpose, especially those in pill form. Once mixed as per directions, Eugalan Topfer is a tasty, easily consumed beverage with a vanilla flavor. You will enjoy the flavor and health benefits."
5,It really works.,"I love this stuff. My father is from Germany and gave it to me when I was a kid. I started taking it again recently and it has helped with my intestinal problems such as bloating and gas. I love the taste, and it also has helped with my lactose intolerance. I think you have to take it for a long time, like most products that actually cure illnesses instead of just quiet the symptoms. I'll be taking Eugalan for months to come."
5,Typical Capstick,If you like Peter Capstick you will like this book. He has a way of putting you there with the rest of his crew. I've read all but two of his books and have yet to find one that I didn't like....this one is no exception.
1,ONLY FOR OLYMPUS,"While Amazon advertises this item as ""good for high drain devices"", be aware: the documentation for the product warns AGAINST using this for anything but Olympus Camedia cameras. It pushes more power through than standard AA batteries: 1,840 vs. 1,700.This product could damage your digital camera.I have returned this item to Amazon - I'm going to get standard Ni-MH batteries and a charger locally."
4,Does a good job.,"There's nothing wrong with this at all. It does exactly what it's supposed to do, even though it seemed to me to be a little slow. Nevertheless, it's compact, and efficient."
5,A must have for my Olympus Camera,this is great little battery charger. It is TINY and travels pretty much anywhere in the world due to it's ability to function at different electrical outputs. All you need is a plug adapter.
2,Please stay away from olympus's overprised accessories.,"Rayovac has a one hour charger with 4 independeent charge circuits (can cahrge unqually used batteries or uneven capacities without over/under charging some of theM)) for the same price as this (w/ batteries). GP has 2000mah batteries. These batteriees are 1700mah. Acessories that I've had interest in that has olympus brand is 50% more expensive than generic brands of the same quality. Olympus has great cameras. Buy the accesories from another brand, cheapeer, higher quality. Oh yeah this is a dumb charger also. That means batteries get overcharged and that substantially reduces their life. You can buy rapid (4-5 hrs charge time), dumb chargers for [$$$]"
5,real to life planet stickers!,It was very hard to find real to life planet stickers for the kids to add to their notebooking journals. We were very excited to find these:)
3,Not for the beginner,I did find this book informative but it is not for the beginner. I felt a nice step by step guide would have been better and it was confusing as tips on how to do this and that were scattered in the book. I had to jump back and forth to find the answers to questions I had. Diagrams were also not clear.
3,Average.,"To be honest I wish this film had been directed by someone other than Winner. Again, we are subjected to another brutal rape scene that Winner apparently is fond of. Although on the one hand the villains are somewhat cartoonish, some of their actions seem to be predicting the Rodney King riots! The horrible music of Jimmy Page is again inflicted upon the audience."
3,"""shoot to kill""","it should be more people like c.b. - here in norway they give medals to gangsters and nice prisonhotels, while retired people are stowed away in old houses. but try to take money from thestate - you end up with 5years in prison. see a mugger? shoot him"" see a burglar? shoot him! see enemies of a free country?shoot ALL of them - all the way from hell and back again.I like c. bronson, john wayne, c. eastwood and j. cash.thmmoldenorway"
5,incredible!,You have to see this to believe it! One of the best action flicks ever made and so entertaining your head will explode! Everybody should own this movie!
3,So bad it's funny.,"Death Wish 3 has to be a parody, nothing can be this stupid and be meant to be taken seriously.Paul Kersey returns to New York just has the old war buddy he is going to visit is beaten to death by thugs. Of course the cops think Kersey did it and arrest him. The precinct captain (Ed Lauter!) recognizes Kersey and hires him to snuff out bad guys. High/low point is when Kersey guns down a mugger (called The Giggler) on a crowded street and every one of the dozens of witnesses cheers and applauds as triumphant music swells.This HAS to be a parody of Death Wish. Director Michael Winner could not have meant for this to be taken seriously. Could he?"
1,Don't have it,"I have the last 2 of the series, but not this one or the 2nd one. I hope this gets resolved soon."
5,Bronson Kicks some Honey Buns,"When the odds are against you, you can count on one man: Charles Bronson. Of the five 'Death Wish"" movies I like this one the most. Bronson cleans up the neighborhood when some ""creeps"" decide to pick on our senior citizens. Yoy really have to like this outing."
5,bronson returns to new york and kills everyone,this is the funniest action movie i have ever seen. bronson finds a war buddy dead at gang hands and has another woman taken from him so he starts a riot and brings out a cannon(well a gun they hunt big game with) and kills every gang member in new york with it.a great release for those who want the bad guys to pay(they pay big time here) and the tone is very light in this over the top shootout. bronson seems to be having fun here and it carries the movie.
4,Death Wish 3,I always liked this movie. When I was a child I thought it was cool a movie was shot where I grow up at. But in truth the movie is a bit lame compared to other action movies or even Death Wish 1. But that does not stop me from watching this flick. This movie is great for all the wrong reasons.
2,Is this an episode of the A Team or a movie?,"I saw this fiasco on television recently. Having seen this movie when I was a young lad, seeing it again makes me realize that this is one of the funniest films ever made. I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but it doesn't matter. The cartoon violence and stupidity of the plot and the dialogue had me laughing out loud at every turn.What the hell are these old people doing living in this neighborhood? ""I think I'll walk home with my groceries through Beirut. oy vie!"" How is Bronson getting RPG's shipped to the UPS store? Why do the thugs just run blindly at the guy holding a machine gun? Why can't the thugs manage to hit the guy standing in the open with a machine gun with their own guns? It's just hilarious once the action picks up. This movie appears to really have been made for people with a gun fetish or something. Worth watching when it's on TV for a laugh."
5,The mother of all guilty pleasures!,"For unintentional hilarity the likes of which have rarely been seen, I recommend this trashy, cheesy, over-the-top, poorly acted masterpiece. The deaths are fall-on-the-floor funny, Bronson says maybe 20 words total, and the romance between him and the public defender is the least credible in film history. The shootout at the end is a camp classic and I would guess that more people die in that scene than in all the other films combined. I have seen this film at least 15 times and it never ceases to bring me to tears of laughter. Please, oh please, bring this to DVD! And how about Gavin ""Chuck Cunningham"" O'Herlihy as the reverse-mohawked bad guy? All I ask is, where was Oscar? Charming, silly, outrageous fun."
1,"Poor writing, poor editing, light on info","I am sorry to report that this book is both poorly written and poorly edited. If you're interested in investing in Dow Dogs, which is what the author touts, you'll be much happier with books like Beating the Dow (Micheal O'Higgins) or the investment books from The Motley Fool."
1,What a Deal!!!!,"53.2 % Creeping red fescue23.4 % Annual Rye grass14.1 Perennial Rye grass4.4 % Kentucky BluegrassThe Creeping Red will die in full sun and the Annual Rye will die after one year, so planted in the sun, a whole 18.5% of your mix will be there next year.They also list no variety names of the Perennial Rye or Kentucky Blue so you don't know what you are getting.I run a seed company and can make this mix for $1.47/pound."
1,Very poor product,"Don't waste your time, money, and effort on this product. I think I got maybe 15 blades of grass. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
4,It works..but,"I bought this about two weeks ago and I planted it immediately as directed. It started growing within 5-7 days, and I am happy of how green it is, but One pack is not enough for a 2.5 x 2.5 meters garden. It seemed to fill the space but now that it's growing, it seems that I need another pack."
2,not recommended,"Grass seed was spread as directed. Grass finally grew after 12 days and not the 5 days as promoted and came in sparsley. We had hopes, based on the promotional information, that we might get some grass seed that would finally grow well. This was not the case. We would not recommend this product as it did not perform as advertised."
4,Pleased,"I am very pleased with the start of the overseed that I planted. On Sept 29th I fertilized & overseaded 4 lbs. of Canada Green. It is very noticeable, expecially the rye grass. [Writen on Oct 19th] Hopefully, the real benifit will show up next spring."
1,The Truth About Canada Green Grass Seed,"I recently purchased this item thinking it was a special type of seed.This is a regular shade type grass seed mixture.It contains:53.2 % Creeping red fescue23.4 % Annual Rye grass14.1 Perennial Rye grass4.4 % Kentucky BluegrassThese numbers were on the bag as required.This is close to the same ingredients in most shade mixtures you can buy at any hardware store. I recently saw a shade mixture with almost identical amounts of these seeds for about $3.00 a pound at my local hardware store. Also the commercials and ads says you can just spread it by hand but the bag tells you to till the soil to a depth of 2"" , rake it in and then use a roller. Not as easy as it seems in their ads.I wish these important mixture percentages were listed before I purchased mine from Amazon. Hopefully it helps you in your buying decision."
1,Totally Dis-satisfied,"We planted the seeds from the directions, watered daily had beautiful sunshine everyday & not 1 sprout of grass to be seen even 2 weeks later. Have contacted the company several times & have had no success in getting an aknowledgement or a response...they said they guarantee that you will have a full lawn in 10 days - well not from this product !"
3,Not good for hot states,"This grass did grow quickly. I saw growth within a week - soft and pretty. However, it cannot take the Texas heat and promptly died within three weeks despite proper watering. This product may do very well in other parts of the country that do not consistently have temps over 90 degrees for many months."
1,Still Waiting for growth,I ordered 5 bags and spread it all in newly tilled ground. I watered regularly and still not one single blade of grass has grown. Perhaps it grows in Canada but not Washington State!! Would not waste my money again.
1,Canda Green - disappointing,Canda Green performance was less than adequate - poor germination rate and as a result a sparsely covered lawn area. I planted seed purchased from a local store in an adjoining area for comparison - there was little difference if any.
1,OVERPRICED Canada Green-Don't Waste Your Money,"Canada Green Grass seed, well ""as seen on TV"" says it all. You see on TV BUT it is very different from reality. Typical infomercial hype, fleecing the American public, no different from Wall Street or the government, A LIE. Go get some Rebel or Gardens Alive tall fescue and you saved mega bucks AND YOU GET A COMPANY WHO WILL RESPOND AND STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT-UNLIKE CANADA GREEN. Search the web and see for yourself. Thank you Amazon for publishing these reviews- unless the dirt bags at reputation defender hide the truth, by forcing removal of the bad reviews, which amount to consoring of free speech. If you wait long enough Obama will buy you this grass seed under the ""lawn entitlement act"""
2,Grass wasn't greener,"Not sure this grass even grew, but the mouse that inhabited my garage for a while sure liked the taste. If you want to feed some mice, then this is your grass. If you want a lush yard, not sure you should get this."
3,So Far pretty good,"Put this seed in here on the front range of Colorado (East side of the Rockies) at 6,500ft elevation. Its been down about 2 months now and I would say the 5,000sg ft. is 75% filled in. This was heavily over seeded soil (good quality fertilized/mulched 6-8 inches deep)and then lawn topper put over the seed and watered daily. There was no original lawn, it was fresh soil trucked in. Its a pretty light green with small blades and very dense. Its Nov 1st now and we will see how it does over the winter. We have already had one V-light snow on it and it was not bothered at all. Also seems to be keeping the weeds down. There was no weed killer used. I'll update this post in June 08, by then it should be at its peak, or not."
2,Not as xpected,"Ok, I did not have the greatest expectations for this product. i did not expect a pefect color match( which it wasn't) I was however hoping it would last. I bought this to fill in a couple bare spots that was left from when they put in my new septic tanks. I followed directions. The grass came in pretty quick, but died out after only a couple months. Of course this is my experience. I don't have the greatest growing environment(a bit sandy), but they do advertise a hardy fast growing easy seeding product. I did spend time prepping and watering with limited disappointing success. If next year it comes back stronger? I will update my post."
1,Nothing so far,Perhaps I haven't waited long enough to see results but it's been well over two weeks since we put down the mixture and there has been NO new grass growth.
4,satisfied customer,"Not exactly what I expected but I planted the grass seed and followed the directions and amazingly, I have grass growing in spots where I could not grow any prior."
3,Total hype,Grass seems to grow ok forget about growing fast as claim. This is a total hype. Any grass can grow assuming you prep the soil and water as recommanded.Save your money and go to any home improvement store and buy some other grass . You will do fine
3,depends,"this product partially surprised me, it did grow during the warm weather. on the other hand it finally succumed 2 the aggressive weeds & grasses already established. i have ST AUGUSTINE,ZOYSIA & a mixture of other grasses thatseem 2 comeback even after i tried 2 expunge them. then there are the extermely determined weeds that grow in my area. perhaps better outside of central FLORIDA."
1,Grass,I've used Canadian grass in Ohio & it grew so fast I had to mow it twice a week. This s*** didn't grow in NC
1,Questionable at Best,2 Lb Canada Green Grass Lawn Seeds Seed MixtureI had a lawn with several spots and hoped this would be a good reseed of those spots. Well to this point No Luck. It's been three weeks and nothing is noticable I did a 10' x 25' area to test. I am patient and will give it another two weeks but doubt that I will waste the time to use the what is left. The bag is supposed to cover 1000 sq. ft. I used a third of it for 250 sq. ft. Alas still bare spots.
1,did not see any result,this item was stated to grow grass in so many days and i did everything to get it to start and i have not seen a new grass started anywhere. i did everything it said to do and watered it very well and still nothingi will never get this product again
1,Western Pennsylvania,"Purchased this product April 2010. Followed directions and had no results. Seed just lay there. Weather was great, warm days and cool nights with light rain. Do NOT waste your money. Go to Wal Mart or your local hardware/garden store."
4,"Cautious Crusade: Franklin D. Roosevelt, American Public Opinion' and the war against Nazi Germany","An excellent historically correct book..""Cautious Crusade: Franklin D. Roosevelt, American Public Opinion, and the War against Nazi Germany"" reviews the years of the second world war in depth."
2,"It may be oil, but the smell is not cedar","Having some very old cedar closets, I had hoped that a good sanding and this product would rejuvenate the wood. The sanding did help the appearance of the wood. The oil did nothing for the fragrance. The oil does not smell anything like fresh cedar planks. Fortunately, the smell does dissipate quickly. Those hoping that this oil will produce an authentic cedar wood smell may be advised to look elsewhere."
5,The masterpiece of American song,"Perhaps the best thing to say about this Songbook is what Ira Gershwin said after hearing it. "" I did not realize how good our songs( George and Ira Gershwin) were until I heard Ella sing them. In these Songbooks she is at her mature best. Her voice is smooth, elegant, clear , beautifully nuanced, rich in range, remarkable. It is sheer joy to listen to her in the very best of the songs. While many prefer the drive and rhythm of Ellington I myself prefer the more lyrical and slower swinging pieces. But what is important is that this is a great Masterpiece which presents the great works of the American Songook in the best way possible.One can listen to these songs again and again , and doing so brings only greater pleasure."
5,WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG FOR ME TO LIKE JAZZ!,"As a kid of 17, i dont know what took me so long to realize my roots. Never in your whole life will you hear anything like Ella in this boxset. In my opinion, it's stupid to waste your time buying all the other cd's of ella ..., by far, if you were going to buy one, this boxset will keep you occupied for the rest of your life. I wish it hadnt taken so long for me to appreciate this music. If you are skeptical, dont be, you will never regret buying this one."
4,Love It,"I love this album. From the production, lyrics, and vocals, I believe this project came strong. Although this isn't the traditional praise and worship style, you can tell this artist loves the Lord. I will definately keep this one on repeat."
2,lectures on philosophy discussing micro differences in terminology with little practical value,"Cons: boring, pointless, pages of discussion with no practical value; author does not offer his concepts, just criticism of othersPros: helps to fall asleep,"
3,underwhelmed,"I've been searching for the meaning of life since I was a teenager. I thought this book would answer my question. It certainly did not.Tillich spent the first 90% of the book over-complicating the issues: the angst we feel (related to death, guilt and meaninglessness), how and why, He researched historical views and progresses. Nothing wrong with that. But I don't think it's complete. So to me, the problems he posted are overly complicated yet incomplete.Then He over-simplified the answer by creating a ""God above God"", in the last few pages of the book. The concept could potentially take away the anxiety related to death and guilt, but not meaninglessness. God is all powerful and almighty. He does not need to create me for His purpose. So ""why am I here"" is still a question to answer."
2,For those wanting intellectual discussion,This is a book of the mind. An intellectual foray into philosophy. I know it is a well regarded text but it certainly was not where I wanted to explore in finding a more heartful understanding of faith. I admit I didn't get terribly far into it before I gave up and moved on. There is so much more out there that calls to a heart centered seeker.
5,Most important popular philosophical/theological book of the 20th century.,"I first read this book in 1967 when I was 17 years old. It clarified my doubts, enlightened and challenged me.I would say it made me largely the man I am today.I reread it just recently, and found it as wonderful and insightful as I did all those years ago.I recommend it to anyone who is curious about their spiritual journey."
3,NOT BAD at all,"first, this thing works.for AM and FM its pretty ok.for intendedd purpose of SW, it works decent tooif you are outside, near window or attach a 2 foot orlonger hair thin wire to it.let the wire go outside your window and its better.i have far more expensive radios too.. kenwwood, yaesu,etc etc... those are in their own class...but if you can get this itemlanded cost to your door for usd 15 or lessand you WANT short wave,you got something htat really worksat half the price of garbage like sangean...its not first class sound,not 2nd class eitherbut it works and not too badfor th e pricenice feature is you manually tune the channelsand you see numbers on the lcd screen !heyno more guessing where you are at.even in SW, where it really helps.would strongly recommennd this itemto anywone into SW listening for first timeor as back up to a backupgo for it.tksk"
2,cheap radio,"This radio did not cost much, and did not provide very good service. The tuner was poor, it always drifted off station. The reception was weak as well."
4,Great Value,Big bang for the buck; I use this on my kitchen table to listen to the news during breakfast. My only complaint is that it defaults to FM so I always have to switch to AM when turning the unit on.
5,Great radio for the money,"This is by far the best inexpensive (cheap, cheap, cheap) radio that I have ever bought."
2,jWIN jxm 14,RADIO HAS GOOD SOUND HOWEVER THE ON/OFF SLIDE SWITCH DOES NOT OPERATE SO IN ORDER TO TURN THE RADIO ON AND OFF YOU MUST REMOVE THE BATTERIES. THIS IS VERY TROBLESOME AND NOT VERY GOOD. POOR DESIGN THE SWITCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE DURABLE TYPE OF SWITCH.
5,amazing quality for the price,"The sight of this compact radio does not reveal the quality of the reception and the quality of the sound and it tunes digitally too. One would expect to pay a heap more. High quality, low price, convenient. The only other thing I would have liked would be memory presets, but for the price no complaint."
3,An interesting little album...,"...I am not entirely sure that ""Lounging"" is a good description for this album, given that some of the tracks are quite upbeat and even from a rock genre in some cases. What is clever about this collection is it's toe dipping into many modern styles and artists, an experience one might not have otherwise, certainly worth a try!"
4,mood changing,I use this music for just listening or when doing massage or Reiki. The combination of the flute and drum is particularly pleasing and definitely puts one in a different and more peacefull state of being. I recently purchased all 10 of Marina's CD and this is one of my favorites.
1,Leather Flip Cover,The plastic mounting device that secures the leather flip cover to the M5 is very poorly engineered. I purchased my M5 in January and this mounting device has already broken. I am seriously considering replacing it with some other protective device.
2,Broken hinge mounts,The plastic hinge mount on the cover that I bought to replace the broken plastic hinge mount on the cover that came with my Ique M5 has now broken. I will now buy another and try to reinforce the hinge before it breaks again.Garmin 010-10567-07 Leather Flip Cover for iQue M5
5,"Exactly as described, quick shipping.",Great replacement for the one that broke. It is identical in every way. Shipping was quick and product is good.
3,This is a REPLACEMENT!,"This is a REPLACEMENT item and you will probably never need one. If you do, it's worth its weight in gold but don't make the same mistake I did and buy it thinking it's an accessory."
3,Helpful,"This is a pretty good help in preparing sermons and the techniques that go into it. The author encourages the reader to use his own style when preaching. I was put off by the author's advice to have a smoke and drink a beer when the sermon preparation is complete. If you can get past that, this will be a good addition to your library."
2,Contrarian review,I'm gonna be the contrarian amidst the 4- and 5-star reviews. This stand works beautifully in the beginning but over time my Blackberry Curve keeps slipping off. The problem is the fold in the leather that holds the BB up at an angle becomes soft and yield to the weight of the BB and therefore no longer holds it in place. They should have put some kind of stiffener.
3,so so,"I was so impressed with Patai's book THE ARAB MIND, that I read this one, too. But this, while interesting, is not as well organized, and is a bit bloated. I think he was learning on this one, to suceed better with THE ARAB MIND. Nonetheless, an interesting and informative book."
4,It doesn't really do it,"This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation , their own Mind is in a constant process of Development and creation. Any summary then seems to be a simple reduction, and not true to the Reality."
3,Interesting,"I thought it was an interesting book. It was certainly better than some of the other books I had to read in junior high. It would be a good book for people who want a short, western novel and for those who want to know what troubles pioneers had out west."
5,Shane,"I have taught ""Shane"" for many years to my Junior classes. My students through the years have loved the book MORE than the movie! They enjoy the movie, but say the book develops the characters much more in depth. We just recently read the fight scene, and they were hooked! I have been in the area where Shane was filmed and have been able to share pictures with my classes. I will continue to teach this wonderful book."
5,Shane: the man of mystery,"Shane was a great book and I really enjoyed it very much. This book had a lot of symbolism in it. Moreover, I did this book as my book report and I really liked it a lot and I had a great time reading it. It was a compelling story for the reason that it had great characters and great plot as well. Finally, I feel that everyone from the ages of 12-adult would enjoy reading this book. Before you read this book or purchase it, you should learn a little about the old west and the styles back then."
2,"Details, Details, Details!!",I did not care for this book at all. It was all detail and description. The excitement of the book isn't until the very end and even that wasn't so great. The only part of the book I enjoyed was the subtle way that Marian had feelings for Shane because she was so fascinated by him. Otherwise I couldn't wait until it was over so I could write my paper and get it over with.
3,It was okay,"I think that the book Shane was a good book, but I only like the ending aand a few other parts about the story. My favorite part was the part about the gun battle. I read this book in my L.A. class."
1,The Book Was boring,"The book was really boring. It made no sense and it had no plot. I would recommend everyone even the author to avoid this book at all cost. If you want to read a book, don't read this one. Read anything else and it will be better than this book. The author made the old west the most boring place on earth."
1,Awful!!!!!!,"If I could, I would give this book a negitive amount of stars, or at least zero! Most of the book was just people talking, and even there talk was boring. Definitly not worth your time."
5,Great book for 7th grade girls and boys,"Great, well written squeaky clean book for my 7th grade daughter. They boys in her class read it to. Plenty of cowboy action, plenty of hard work and good character winning the day. Presents several men of different integrity/character. Only one female lead, but she is a spectacular role model. Book also tackles difficult issues with grace. Like what to do when you are married and attracted to someone else. My daughter and I had an amazing conversation about that one day. Excellent book."
5,Shane,"Absolutely beautiful. I have read it twice and will reread. I have seen the movie several times. There is absolutely no one that could play the part but Alan Ladd. If you know Alan Ladd, and as you read the book, you will realize that Shane was written for this great actor. This book just has everything meant for a good western. However, as much as I like westerns and realize how proud these Western men are, I did not like the ending. I wanted Joe Starrett to go after Shane and make sure his wound was tended to. But, in the great scheme of things I realize that it really doesn't matter. Shane did what he was intended to do and then he sailed off into the sunset. God Bless Shane and Jack Schaefer. You can find out what type of a man wrote this book and it is too bad we never got to know him any better. We all missed out on this great man's life, but, he left us Shane and this was important."
1,Waste of Paper,"Don't get me wrong, the guy has talent. To fit a 1 paragraph story into a 119 page book takes skill. If Schaefer had any plot to the storey, it might actulally have been a good book. But it wasn't. There were about three things that actually happen in the story, and they are obvious. I wouldn't have read this book if I hadn't been forced to."
1,Not that great- not worth the time,"I had to read this book for a 7th grade report, and belive me, it was terrible. The whole school hated it, all the teachers too-except the ones who taught literature. Is this some universally bad book for kids, and great book for adults into literature? I strongly object one of the other reveiws,the one who says kids who don't like this book haven't read ""great literature."" I love to read, and even though Western novels aren't my favorite, I do know the difference between a good book and a bad one- this was clearly one bad book. Many reviewers say this book was too descriptive. It definatly was, but that is not a major reson to dislike this book. The major thing was that it was too boring, I couldn't read more than ten pages before starting to skip words, sentences, even paragraphs."
1,The Worst,This is the worst and most pointless book ever written I had to read it for school and I did not understand one bit of it. It should not be sold it is the worst book ever.
1,I hated it,... Although it seems I am the only person who expressed my feelings for this book negativly my feelings are true. This book was BORING and students do not have to go threw the pain and sorrow. Sorry if any one got offended.
1,I hated it,I am a student from Saxton Middle school. Although it seems I am the only person who expressed my feelings for this book negativly my feelings are true. This book was BORING and students do not have to go threw the pain and sorrow. Sorry if any one got offended.
2,Needs more excitement.,I really didn't enjoy this book at all. It's not my kind of book. If it had had more excitement and a little more detail I would have liked it more. The descriptions of the fights Shane got into were not my kind of detail. More excitement and laughter and fun would improve this book a great deal.
5,"A dark, sad Western classic. . .",The story centers much upon the failure of a man to control himself when fate and violence close in around him. It can be seen as an allegory of our times
4,Shane,I would recommend this book to someone else because it is very exciting and interesting. The characters were well constructed throughout the book and it had a lot of unusual twists to it. This book was very easy to read and it's a good book to read especially if you like western stories.
4,Rounds out the film nicely.,"Spare, evocative writing by first-time author Schaefer accompanied by a selection of analytic articles give this edition depth. A satisfying read."
4,Shane,"This book is about a guy named Shane who rides into Wyoming who is very mysterious. He trys to help a freind out and only makes it worse,but makes evrything better in the end. The reason I liked this book is because it tells you how the west was. It makes you feel like your actually there. I didn't like that he didn't get a girl or a big amount of land for it,but what can you say for a freind who rides alone with one dark side you don't wnat to be on."
4,Better then i expected.,When my teacher first told us that we were going to be reading the book Shane i had never heard of it. Then when she said that it was a western it made me want to read it less. But once i started reading in i started to enjoy it. The further in the book the more I liked it. I think it is a very good book and that it should be read by all.
3,Well written with some slow spots,"Andrew Sinclair obviously knows his material and I found the book excellenty researched with tons of facts, names and dates. it did tend to drag sometimes but never for any long period of time. My only problem with the book is that the author tends to dismiss some alternative theories a little too easily."
5,this is my most treasured book !,"I came across Seal Morning many years ago, even then I had it with me for a long time before I read it. I found it by fate, when I was going through old unused lockers in my old school. I didn't know why I kept it but after DEFINITELY more than 2 yrs then was I compelled to read it. It is a book that brought joy & sadness all the same. It appeals to all of us who love animals. The way it was written without any chronological contraint, is refreshing. It comes across as an account, or maybe as a documentation but rarely is it anonymous as there're many poignant moments Rowena shares with us. Her animals were her friends & she was theirs, & in the solitude of the hills this couldn't be more true !!"
5,Wonderful Book!,"I loved this book! It gives the reader a wonderful taste of the wilds of Scotland and of ""croft life."" I like to imagine living like this. Though this book tends to jump around, that makes it more interesting. It is a perfect gift for the animal or nature lover: the descriptions of the landscape and Rowena's relationship with the animals she cares for are beautiful and touching."
4,"Wonderful, beautiful read...",This is a wonderful read for anyone and at any age. Ms Farre is something of an obscure character now and it's true that some authorities have claimed parts of this autobiography are somewhat fanciful but this reviewer says 'so what?' It brings back a multitude of fond memories and I find myself smiling as in years past as I wend my way through this colorful and detailed account of croft life in a former era. A classic to warm the heart.
5,Very good condition!,"Although the book is a 1938 edition, it is still in good condition.I was really looking forward to receive it and the shipping was really fast. Thank you very very much!Alessandro"
4,"Harmless fun, even for someone with much more $$$ kit!","Having progressed from MKII's thru to Pioneer CDDJ-1000's I still loved playing around with this true toy! Having seen this product badly demonstrated in the Yamaha shop nearby I still retained the interest to know what was do-able with this thing - making the clear assumption that Yamaha REALLY know what to do with digital drum sounds...The loops are okay, i mean a fair few are weird (but useable) stuff - but on the whole made a joy by the break down Part Mixer setting... Then you bring in the FX and you are really talking. You could go on for hours about each, but you start envoking the Ring Mod effect and playing with the knobs and dials (names become irrelevant when you know what they do!) and you can keep a crowd going for hours!!!Hard to be a DJ Snob when you see what fun you can have!Enjoy!"
5,THIS IS AWESOME,THIS IS THE COOLEST GIFT I HAVE EVER HAD. IF YOU WANT TO BE A PRO DJ THIS IS THE WAY TO START. IT IS A LITTLE PRICY BUT YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH.
2,Not too looking,"I bought this shirt and had to return it immediately. The color is not bright and I can best describe it as off white. The medium size of this shirt appear to be larger than what I normally wear. The design is beautiful but in all, I did not like the shirt."
3,Not Guayabera,"I ordered this shirt expecting it to be a long sleeve guayabera, it is not. It is a good looking shirt so I am keeping it, but the embroidery is only on the colar and the sleeve cuffs."
1,This is not for Cole Porter fans. It is for Jazz fans.,"Be careful before you purchase this CD. If you enjoy Cole Porter because of the creative tempos, the mix of rythmns and lyrics, the way that words play together, and the great melodies - then this is not your CD. The musicians are jazz specialists who see a tune only as the base for them to express their own attitudes, and they destroy Cole Porter by employing their own tempos and melodies and inserting long segments of instrument skill demonstrations that have nothing to do with the song. If you like Jazz, it's probably decent. If you like Cole Porter, don't waste your money."
5,They're all mad,"The set is exactly as it is billed: a compendium of Cole Porter covers by VERVE jazz artists. Want Frank's cover of Under My Skin? Don't like Ella's live performance in the VERVE set? Then burn your own CD. In doing so, the VERVE set will be an invaluable resource."
1,Ditto,"I can do nothing but reemphasize what the reviewers before me said -- these performers really do Porter an injustice by ""reinterpreting"" his melodies and lyrics. I originally had high hopes for this CD, but I should have read the Amazon reviews before getting it... If you want great Porter, with authentic 1930-era bounce, I recommend the CD ""The Song Is...Cole Porter."" There is a whole series of ""The Song Is..."" covering many different writers, and it is much better than the stuff here. But again, as the others said -- if you like hard jazz, this is the place to be."
1,Cole Porter Songbook...Not,"If you are looking for the quintessential Cole Porter collection, keep looking. If you're looking for some classical renditions of Cole Porter favorites keep looking. What this is, in my opinion, is a collection of songs that were obviously easy to get royalty wise. A bunch of scat singing on the vocals by Ella Louie and Mel, and a bunch of challenges to the musical scales by improvisation-happy saxophonists. No Frank, Dean, Perry, Tony. In this collection you get Cole Porter lyrics but not enough Cole Porter music. Cole must be spinning in his grave so fast he could reach the center of the earth in a New York minute if he was interred vertically."
3,Love the facts and pictures,I love the detail of these flash cards and the pictures are great but they are so thin that I cant let my 2 year old use them. He bends them all up
4,"Good fun, though not the strongest in the series","More good fun from Chester Himes. On the plus side, he finally includes some entertaining sex. On the other hand, one of the main bad guys here (the ""Colonel"") is particularly flat and unbelievable. Also, as usual, the end is much less satisfying than the ride to get there."
4,weird number,Everything was great about these except the amount included.....most drapes are made for 10 rings. I don't understand why this only comes with 7. However they are stylish and inexpensive.
4,"Good value, unique ... but watch your measurements.","I ordered this item hopeful that it would fit my rods. However, as others have mentioned, the dimensions are not truly 2"" ... likely best for a 1"" rod. Anything over that just doesn't work.Regrettably, this item was returned."
1,the specification is misleading,"This is not 2-Inch Drapery Ring. The actual outer diameter is 1.8"", while the actual inner diameter is 1.4""."
5,Perfect,"I had a large window to cover and bought a 170"" rod, (1 inch in diameter) for it, along with some beautiful 108"" drapes from Pottery Barn.I needed 40 rings for the four panels I bought, but the Pottery Barn rings were $21.00 for a set of 7. I would've needed 6 packages... which would've cost me $126.00. More than I spent on the rod!!I'm glad I checked here for the rings first. These were absolutely perfect. I was worried they'd look cheap... but they're solid, well put together and they look great.It seems to me these rings would easily fit a rod up to 1.5"" in diameter.And just incase you don't know, you'll need curtain hooks. Unless you buy curtains online from Pottery Barn... the hooks come with them. :DIf you like the double rings, these are the way to go!"
3,just ok,This organizer is ok but it could be better. The largest compartment on the bottom is not large enough to hold a standard Rand McNally road map. It does not stay attached on the bottom of the seats all that well either. Not as great as I expected it to be.
3,ok quality,I think this item is slightly over rated. It's neither cheap or heavy duty. My mesh bash in the front bottom was torn by one of those grill lighters. The pockets are kind of small so its good for a lot of little things. It will last awhile but not sure its worth the money?
2,didn't like,"It would not stay tied to the bottom of my seat, so just flapped around and looked messy. I used it for a few weeks and finally took it out. I have a 2012 Kia soul, would not recommend for seats like mine."
5,"So far, so good",So far so good. I installed this into my Honda Odyssey on the passenger seat and I tied the bottom down. It fits an immense amount of stuff. I'm really happy!
4,"frog ""ribbits"" to dance beats?!?!","I remember first hearing this song in 1994, when I was DJ'ing at a nightclub. I was in love with it, and so was the crowd. I would get requests for the froggy song all the time. It is a fun track. It hasn't aged all that well, but it hasn't aged that badly either. If you're interested in dance music that is a little bit different, give this one a shot."
2,Snowless and boring,"This disc was a majoy letdown. Not only did it seem like I was being taken around the same house and neighborhood (just from different angles and distances) but there was NO snow anywhere! No snow!!! Sorry...I'm from New England, and the light displays on grassy and leafy yards just don't emit that warm, colorful, reflective glow as on snow. The Christmas spirit was definitely lacking on this disc. One reviewer hit it on the head by saying ""...but if you play this DVD while decorating your tree or opening gifts, only a Grinch would dare to complain."" EXACTLY!!! As long as you DON'T watch it, it's decent (except for the Willie Nelson song...UGH!!!). So, tell me...why not just buy a MUSIC CD instead???I feel Sights and Sounds of Christmas FAR exceeds this DVD on every level."
2,Where's the snow????,"Maybe it's because I'm from New England, where we actually see snow during the Winter months, that I really hated this DVD. Sure, there were plenty of Christmas lights to see, and some fairly decent music to listen to (Willie Nelson should have been left off this disc) but there is NO snow!! No SNOW!!! I saw maybe 2 seconds of snow falling beside I street light, and that was it. No kidding! All the yards and ocean scenes and everything had NO SNOW...just grass and brown leaves! It did NOT feel like Christmas at all!The only Christmas DVD I've really enjoyed, that truly captures the feel of Christmas, is ""The Sights and Sounds of Christmas."""
1,Not a good book,"I purchased this book in addition to the FE Review Manual by Lindeburg. I took the FE exam 2 weeks ago and the content in the Electrical PM book was nothing like that on the exam, in fact, the examples were much more difficult than the actual exam problems.I would go with the PM Electrical book by the same publishers as the Lindeburg book, PPI. This book from REA was not helpful."
3,NOT BAD-,"IT HELPS ON POWER SYSTEM, CONTROL AND SOME COMPUTER PM QUESTIONS ...A TOTAL OF 15 OUT OF 60 TO DO BETTER YOU'LL NEED TO STUDY OTHER MATERIALS AS WELL BUT OVER ALL NOT BADTHX. GOOD LUCK ."
1,Worst PM book on the market,"This book is the biggest pile of crap. Not only is it extremely outdated, the example problems and practice tests are multiple times harder than the actual test. The writing is poor, the section depth is laughable, and the explanations are even worse. Unfortunately, I have yet to find a decent PM EE book, they all seem to be quite worthless. Of the 3 I've referenced, this one is by far the worst."
3,"Disappointment (for me, your mileage may vary)","Based upon the other reviews I bought this album. I should have done ""due diligence"". I did not realize that all of the tracks but two had been recorded before on other albums (which I already have). So I was not listening to anything new, except in the sense that Bill never plays any tune the same way twice. Also I felt rather cheated by Verve in that the amount of music on this CD amounts to about 35 minutes. 35 minutes?! Bill's earlier albums were all generous with material, with most coming in at 50 minutes or more. I think I've reached the limit on my Bill Evans buying. The last three albums have been disappointments in various ways. The Paris 1 concert for example - not the classic Bill Evans. This one as already noted. And 'You must believe in Spring'. I really don't like that one at all. I think I must have all the really good ones now (all early) except for New Jazz Conceptions (1956). I might go for that one just to see what REALLY EARLY was!"
3,All-Star Baseball 2000 is ok,"This game is fun for road trips and vacations if you can't bring the N64 version with you. Although the game is fun, challenging and addictive, the main problem with it is that it takes a long time to change batters as the player is forced to watch the batter run back to the dugout and the next batter run up to the plate after a strikeout. Also when the player gets three outs they have to watch the players run into the dugout. This makes the game take on a rather slow pace. The batting and feilding are fun as a pitcher can select from 8 pitches to throw at 3 different speeds. A batter can hit the ball where they want using the east to use controls. It is a fun game overall because a player can have a homerun derby with almost any player from any team and even have a season and an All-Star Game. I would suggest that only a serious baseball fan purchase this game."
2,OK,This game is great for people who do not know much about baseball. This game gives me trouble sometimes to throw the ball and it is really hard to get a hit or even harder to hit a home-run. i would not say this is the best baseball game out there.
4,B BALL COOL,"This Game is FUN! My sister hates it, but she is stupid! I love home run durby you will love the whole game."
4,Casualties Mount,"Literally taken place the evening after the first War Games, War Games: Tides is the continued story of the battle facing Batman and his allies in the face of gang reprisals following the death of many of the city's key underworld leaders.War Games: Tides provides an answer to who is responsible for that fateful meeting, and has fatal consequences for one of Batman's allies as others try to gain advantage in the ensuing chaos. It also highlights Batman's weakness of playing his cards too close to his chest and underestimating the ramifications of his plans in the hands of others."
4,Thorium Remix 2011,Thorium Remix 2011. This DVD spells out the many reasons that Thorium should be consideredas a replacement for Uranium in nuclear reacters in power plants
4,Odd mixture of concerns,"Rick Bass is a marvelous writer with a true gift for the language and a conservationist's heart. That said, I was put off by his references to hunting. For this Buddhist oriented reader, even though the circumstances of the hunting seemed mostly justified, the concept rankles. The idea isn't off-putting enough, however, to keep me from reading more by Rick Bass."
4,A writer to further explore,"Rick Bass and Terry Tempest Williams gave a presentation together at our Book Festival this year. The short stories in this book have been my first experience reading his works. I found them to be creative, intense and well written. There was a feeling of despair about the present human condition and state of our world through out the book, though not overwhelming. That said, these stories are well worth reading and probably should be read and their underlying message pondered.Bass is a fascinating writer and I plan to read more of his work."
1,Avoid!!,Terrible product!! Doesn't even deserve one star!! Runs and streaks hours after application. Very embarrassing to have streaks running down your arms and face long after applying this nightmare.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!
3,The original non-live version I have 10 times better.,"I just ordered this cd, after having refound the original Autumnal Park, I was curious to see what the live cd was. To tell you the truth, I was a little disappointed. I much prefer the original. Maybe if I were to actually see them live, or would have seen them live, it would be different. In the meantime, I'll stick to the original, which I do give 5 stars... I love, I love, I love..."
5,GENERATION X LEARNS IMPORTANT HISTORY!,"As a member of 'Generation X', I'm afraid the history lessons in school did not include actual (and factual) accounts of the wars covered in this book. I learned a lot about how America got involved and what life was like for the outstanding soldiers who fought for the very freedom I enjoy today. (By the way, my heartfelt gratitude to those soldiers for that privilege!) Another aspect left out of the history texbooks today is how people existed before the invention of cell phones, computers, satellites, etc. Thanks to Warren for those kind of details included in this book - I recommend this book to everyone in their 30s and younger, who yearn for those kind of stories. This book is a wonderful legacy to hand down through the generations in Warren's family and fascinating accounts of history for the rest of us!"
4,air compressor 12v,great shipping is why i purchased online..found out the same one could be purchased local for 4 dollars less..go figure?
2,"Works, barely.... Buy a better one....","My tires were a few pounds low, and when i filled them with this pump it took forever. I mean I was there for 10 minutes, and it only added like 1 lb. It also can't run for more then 10 minutes, or it gets hot. I would recommend something else. this is OK to have in the car, but it might burn out by the time you fill your tires. Also, the guage is not accurate. My tires are 30lbs, it consitantly read 40lbs."
4,Worked great for 3 years - then died. Getting another.,"This dandy pump runs off the 12 vdc lighter outlet in the car. It generates enough pressure for bike tires and can fill a soggy car tire while you finish your coffee. The pump housing gets hot hot hot, so the manufacturer recommends giving it a breather after a few minutes to cool off. Mine died after a 3 years of occasional use, but it worked so well and cost so little I'll get another."
5,Excellent True Story of Life and War!,"Don Wulffson wrote a great book that in the first few chapters didn't attract me but gets so much better as it goes on. ""Soldier X"" is a true story about a 15 year old boy named Erik Brandt that gets drafted into Hitler's army and is sent to fight the Russians. He realizes that you have to ""kill or be killed."" When he is close to the last moments of his life he figures out a new way to survive.Throughout the book, Erik goes through many obsticles that are truly just unimaginable. The book has very terrifying moments that keep the reader interested and having strong feelings and hopes for the main character.When you come to the end of the book, you really are struck with strong feelings of how World War Two was. This is definatley an incredible and strong moving book for anyone!"
3,Good War Novel,"Soldier X by Don L. Wulffson is a historical fiction novel about a sixteen-year-old boy named Erik Brandt. Erik is drafted into the German army without really knowing what he is fighting for. After being wounded, he finds his way behind enemy lines. If you read this book, you can find out how he struggles to survive with his Russian friend, Tamara.This book is set in the first person view, with Erik narrating. I did have a few questions about this book when I was finished, but I couldn't tell you them without spoiling the plot.I thought this book was a bit boring at times, and I was expecting something with a bit more meat, especially since this is a war novel. I however would recommend this novel to any teenager who enjoys war novels."
3,Different Sides of the War,"Soldier X is about a fifteen year old Russian drafted into Hitler's army. He went to war and they started to fight. A bunch of Germans were dead on the bunker and then a tank drove over it. Russians were stabbing people on the ground wounded or not. Eric switches uniforms with a dead Russian. He's taken to a hospital and when recovered he becomes a nurse. The war was headed their way so they moved. He and Tamara go a long way, then work in a German hospital. They get wounded and go to an American hospital in Germany and finally move to America.I liked four things about Soldier X. First, I liked that Eric could speak German, Russian, and American. Second, I liked that Eric helped out at the Russian hospital. Third, I liked that Eric went back to helping his own army in the hospital. Fourth, I liked that he and Tamara stayed together. And finally, I didn't like that Eric betrayed his own army."
5,Excellent Read,"I bought this for my son who had read it along time ago. He says its a fantastic book, one he could not put down."
5,Soldier X,"I loved the book Soldier X. First of all this book had a great plot. The ending of this book was very suprising. Last but not least but not least this book had a great theme about the horrors of World War 2.I think that the best part of the book was when X was in the frontline of the war in Germany. He was sent from the stationary bunker in the heavily guarded area, to the front lines to face the enemy head on. It was the time in the story when most of his friends died, except for one which he never saw again.One time in the story that was most vivid was when X saw his friends die. It was the way that he explained it, just seemed very graphic. Like one time heard an artillary round coming so they all ducked. When they all got up he saw his friend dead."
2,Big Questions of History,"A lot of reviews are praising this novel as being so historically accurate, but when I read it I had some real questions. My father who was a combat veteran who fought with General Patton says that American troops had not crossed the Rhine River into Germany in October 1944, so it is impossible for the hero Erik to have been shot by American troops in the heart of Germany or to go to an American Red Cross Hospital and be cared for by Americans (p. 221 in the book. So what really happened???"
1,this book sucks,I didn't like the book Soldier X. It is about a boy and his friend in a war and how nasty it is in the trenches where they stay.This book Soldier X is stupid put nicely. It makes no sense at all. It moves from place to place without you noticing it. Don't read this book. It isn't worth it.
4,Pretty good book,"This book was pretty good. It had some very good moments, and some not as good. Don Wullfson put great detail into the book and it's characters. The story is very catchy. It tends to hook you from the beginning. The book is, in my opinion, a historical fiction novel. I like history so it suited me well. It's not a long book, but it took me at least a day to it. The author puts very good detail into the scenery, and events. Which is to be expected since the book is based on his life, and experiences during World war two. Overall I would recommend this book to anybody who likes fiction."
5,A perfect album...,"Take the time to read all of the previous reviews of HAVE MOICY....all are accurate and *still* won't prepare you for the wonderful listening experience that awaits you should you purchase this strange, exhilirating album.Imagine the O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU soundtrack on psychedelics and you're on your own from there.Yippee!!"
5,DRIVE YOUR GIRLFRIENDS INSANE,"Folks, this album is legendary. The male hippies i grew up with played this LP so frequently that it was often the biggest point of argument in the household, especially when drugs were in short supply. (times of no money and pot will get you through hard times better than money and no pot). Now, it's 30 years later, and i still remember all the songs and hearing them again is better than a mutual full body orgasm with a juicy college student. If i had to choose between living my life without this album, or without the entire rest of all the music i have or have ever heard, it would be any easy choice. If i have to tell you my choice then you've never heard this album"
5,phase one,"My ex wife broke my first copy in 1976. She said it was an accident...? Anyway, went right out and bought another, wore it out, bought another and now have the CD also. One of my favorites to be sure. Oh yeah, Have Moicy 2 is in the embryonic stages. Yippee!"
5,"Wonderfully entertaining, eclectic and very musically adept","This album has been one of my favorites for years. It combines humor and great mastery of ""folk"" stylings to create an American classic. Post-""Hippies"" and other folks like me will LOVE it! Belongs in every true lover of classic rock's CD collection."
4,cd not quality that was stated,"Everything was here on time, cd was scratched, so it starts skipping about three quarters of the way through every song"
4,am radio,It works for exactly what I need it for. The stations fade and overlap at times but for the cheap price what do you want? It's great for walks although the station fade is something you have to work with.
5,Beautiful,"I'm not going to go track for track in my review. I'll just say that this is the best trance I've heard in the last 3 years. It is simply killer. CD 1 is the highlight, which is unusual given the make-up of most 2-disc trance CDs. CD 2 is excellent also but if you want beautiful, melodic trance with a nasty edge, CD 1 delivers big time. ""My Name is Jaques"" absolutely rocks (think massaging vibrating bass with spacey exterior notes to delight the ears along with an absolute explosion at 3:23....fantastic on good headphones and unreal on a big system) and then leads into incredibly satisfying and progressively melodic finishing tracks. Get it. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Very Good Real Trance,"I just bought this and I am writing a review the same day.Man I'm just happy to finally buy a trance mix that doesn't isn'tfilled with vocals.I do like my vocal trance but this is what I want to hear when I want to be in overdrive.If you want the vocals don't get this one, vice versa.Of course I am on the 6th song as I write this so it can change and it will still be great.Buy this one."
5,Really great trance album,"This is a really great mix album, even though I am two years too slow in buying this. I keep hearing the tracks via Slacker player, and more than three or four have caught my attention. So I tired out the previews on Amazon MP3 and a lot more seemed to hit the right target. Currently I have around 20 or so tracks rated 3 stars or higher on iTunes so this should go some way to summing it up, especially considering I'm fussy when it comes to trance. Overall: worth getting."
1,techno junk,"First and foremost I'm a big fan of Van dyk, Tiesto, Oakenfold, and Van Buuren. This album by above & beyond is by far the wrost journey into trance I have ever been to in my life. It doesn't come close to anything I recognize as trance. This is what I would consider the boring techno you would hear at a club and that you think it might get better after 10 shots of patron...it doesn't. To summarize, it is lack luster, anticlimatic and by no means a journey to Xanadu.I am very disappointed that I was finagled by the raved reviews it got on amazon. What is wrong with you people?!"
5,"Great, uplifting trance","Confirming what most of the previous reviews have reported..this 2 disc set really is a great mix by Above/Beyond with lots of uplifting tunes, beats, and melodies. I would go as far as saying that there are no bad tracks on this entire mix. If you're a fan of trance, anything by AvB or PvD, or are looking to get into trance, I would suggest this Volume 5 mixed by Above and Beyond."
5,The best book I have ever read,"I have read this book countless times. Reading books more than once is unusual, but this was intriguing. Sheldon did research for this book and pays off when the storyline takes you to the occupation of Paris during the second World War. What amazing detail! It really made me feel like I was living through that time. Don't miss the part when Noelle tries to help her friend escape the Nazis!! It had my heart pounding!! If you saw the movie and didn't like it, DO NOT skip the book. The movie left out the best parts!!"
5,The Other Side of Midnight,Have not read this book yet. Presently have collected all of the Sidney Sheldon hardback books but one. All so far have been great reading.
5,The Other Side of Midnight Review,"This book is another one of my favorites from Sidney Sheldon. From chapter to chapter, page to page, you just can't put the book down. There are twists and turns, and you'll find yourself saying ""Oh my gosh!"" half the time. It is truly a great book. Don't forget to buy the sequel to this book - ""Memories of Midnight."""
4,Not bad,"This book was yet another good one from sidney sheldon.The story is about two women ,Noelle and Catherine who both fall in love with the same man Larry.Larry promises noelle that he would marry her but then he has told it to many women.Noelle beleives him and then realises what had happened and then seekes revenge on Larry who is married to Catherine in a different country.Another important character in this story is that of Constantine Demeris who is a very rich Greek man and Noelle uses him without his knowledge to destroy Larry.Also I would like to point out the mistake that Sidney Sheldon has made : on page 246 in 'the other side of midnight it is told that Melina (Demeris's wife)told her outraged parents that Demeris had many affairs. But in ' memories of midnight' (part two in this two part series) on page 47 it is told that Melina lost both her parents when she was thirteen . How can this be????"
5,Wow!,"Excellent, excellent book. This came out when I still a kid, but I remember mom and aunts discussing it. Nearly thirty years later, I finally had a chance to read it, and it really stands the test of time.Right from the get-go it sucks you in with an interesting cast of characters flying into Greece for a trial of a famous actress. Turns out she's the ""whore,"" and the otherside of midnight for her is, Catherine, the ""virgin."" How these two end up in each other's lives and what they do to each other...well that's to read and find out. The ending is a zinger as well.Truly there is nothing bad about this about this book. It's a bit ""larger-than-life"", but that's just what makes it so fun."
4,"The first, the best","The master of insipid novels wrote his ultimate masterpiece (if we can call it by this name) in 1973. THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT is a real page-turner, you will read it in two days maximum... Of course, the usual Sheldon's flaws are all there for everyone interested to see (read) them, but I think this book is the benchmark for the expression ""guilty pleasure..."""
5,THE SHELDON TO READ by M. Boucher,"Sheldon's classic. If you have never read one of his book, start with this one. You won't be disappointed. More than 5 stars!"
4,Accurate description of book condition...,"The book I received was in very good condition as described, however, the book appears to be an old edition from the dust jacket, which I didn't really expect."
5,The Other Side of Midnight,This book arrived ahead of schedule and in excellent condition. It was exactly as advertised and is a nice addition to my library. Great purchase!
1,not worth the money,"After reading the editors note on this book one is lead to believe that this book will give you information on 19-century photography. You are lead to believe that a wealth of information is on hand, but it is note. In fact very little is shown concerning photography, and almost nothing at all concerning the cameras. In short this book is trash, and not worth the money, or the paper it is printed on!"
2,The Verdict is in on the SE-8050,If I could do it all over again I would have not bought this battery charger. I mainly bought it for the high amperage boost application to start vehicles with weak or dead batteries. What I found is that the machine cranks up the voltage on the 300 amperage settings to alarming levels. I noticed this when my Mid 70's Pontiac Volt gauge got pinned during a boosted start. Turns out 30amp and 60 amp is enough for most starts anyway and the voltage is not crazy at these levels. I also wish I would have bought a automatic charger instead of having to baby sit this thing. It asks for using a hydrometer for calculating charge times(good luck with a sealed battery). I ended up buying a cheapo automatic Menards charger to compliment this charger. The battery load test/charge test seems to work ok. Only two stars from me. Please rate this review if it was helpful.
3,Schumacher SE-8050 Charger/Tester Packaging Gets One Star!!!,"It' came out of the box damaged because it so heavy the bottom has a bulge in it. The end caps for the wheels were missing and had to go to home depot for the parts. Once assembled, it looks fine. I've not had the chance to use it yet so I just hope it works. I just hope the company will stand behind the product if it fails to charge or operate as intended. They need to find a better packaging system to protect their product for transport.Regards,Tim Terlecky"
2,Very disappointing,"After reading Wagner's other work, and especially after reading Carolyn See's enthusiastic review in the Washington Post, I had high hopes for this book. But The Chrysanthemum Palace was a disappointment, a thin sketch of a story with weak, unlikable characters and a Hollywood backdrop that many writers -- including Wagner himself -- have made much more vivid. At about page 140, I skipped the next 50 pages or so and read the last 15 or 20 pages, none of which made me want to return to the part I passed over.Wagner is a talented writer and adept storyteller, so I'm rather baffled by this tepid effort. Maybe this was just one of those mistakes that writers occasionally make in selling an idea to a publisher, then finding that it really doesn't engage them or that they can't flesh it out well enough in time for a deadline. I still look forward to Wagner's future projects, but this particular book was a waste of my time and money."
2,Doesn't Come Close to Still Holding or I'll Let You Go,"Still Holding and I'll Let You Go are among my favorite novels of the past 5 years. By comparison, The Crysanthemum Palace was a huge disappointment. At no point did the characters, the plot or the Hollywood environment grab me the way those other two novels did.Children of celebrities is a potentially great subject for a novel. Unfortunately, the three major characters in this novel held very limited appeal for me. And the parallels between the science fiction TV series and what was happening in the characters' real lives just didn't work for me in the least.For a new reader of Bruce Wagner, I'd start with the second, then third of the cellphone trilogy and leave this one alone."
5,A Tribute Worthy of a Great Musician,"John McLaughlin has done something very rare: he has released a ""tribute"" CD that honors both his own unique talent and that of Bill Evans. McLaughlin never imitates; he interprets. His interpretations are fresh, but they demonstrate deep respect for the man to whom he pays tribute.McLaughlin is dead-on accurate about one thing: an all-guitar ensemble does flatter Bill Evans's great compositions. The romantic sound of classical guitar perfectly expresses the romanticism of Evans's music. From prologue to epilogue, these arrangements and performances sparkle."
3,Time Best Forgotten,"A few general comments, contrary to the general perception about this album. I was moved by it when I first heard it, but subsequently, on repeated listenings was disappointed that nothing of further depth emerged and it failed to hold my attention, beyond a few tracks.True, there are some moving and sensitive interpretations of some of Evans' best work here, but that is only a small part of the concentrated essence distilled by Bill Evans. He had the most incredible touch,(as does McLaughlin) but he could also swing mightily and play with immense soul and frankly this album doesn't invigorate the senses.All the best tribute albums should make you return to the artist being celebrated, without overshadowing the legacy. Here, I feel grateful for the legacy of Bill Evans without feeling that John McLaughlin, for all his artistry, has added to it. That is disappointing. A missed opportunity."
3,"It should be brilliant, and yet...","I grabbed this album as soon as I saw it in a store. A brilliant guitarist arranging the music of perhaps the most extraordinary pianist of his time. This should be an incredible album, and yet I find it almost unlistenable. Somehow, in the translation from Evans' performances to the ensemble arrangement, the fluidly and grace of Evans' playing disappears. Now I see that many, if not most of the reviewers love this disc. Most of the musicians I've played it for find it stiff and lacking in feeling. Fortunately Amazon has provided plenty of MP3 samples, so you can decide for yourself if it appeals to you."
5,Thank you for writing this,This book is a jem. I very much recommed this book who has trancended the intellect to see intellect as a car so important to operate correctly. Perhaps best for advanced Jungian like minded souls and those touched by God (ie handicap of some kind inducing infused knowledge)or those not yet having yet heard the call to life.
4,Makeup fanatic - love this!!,"I have tried every brow powder, pencil, tint known to womankind and I have never found one that I truly loved the look of. I have tried all of these because I am an eyebrow fanatic! I think if your eyebrows are not neat, then don't bother with the rest of your makeup routine. Your eyebrows bring your whole look together. Anyway, I read about this product in a magazine and decided to give it a whirl and it's the best product I've ever purchased. I purchased the brow set in Pewter and I mix the two colors together. They are kind of dark, but my natural hair color is medium brown so it works. If my hair were any lighter I would have to get the blonde (which I am still considering purchasing),but for now what I have works excellent. The color is great, the wax keeps my eyebrows in place and I couldn't be happier. I know it's just makeup, but it makes my day, every day."
5,Buyer beware!!,"This is for sure a great book, if you have the ability to concentrate for more than five minutes, unlike the majority of the Herd, in mean people, of today. If your intrest lies in the substance of this book, read some other review, I'm only going to tell you that, the (1909) publication, stinks; the so called book, is more like a oversized magizine, and the print is about the size of a footnote in the bible."
2,Digital files a problem,"I purchased this item from the Amazon MP3 store. Now I'm no snob when it comes to classical music, or I wouldn't be purchasing collections of music rather than full pieces. However I would like to have some idea who performed the music. On each piece in this collection, the artist is identified as ""The Most Relaxing Classical Piano in the Universe"". No specific pianists or orchestras are listed at all. In addition, the files have nothing in the composer field. It's just blank. However, the composer's name is listed...in the name field. Just before the name of the piece. This just seems lazy to be honest. Nothing wrong with the music, but I prefer some honest effort to create proper files and I like to know who the performers I aam listening to are. [...] No famous performers at all, but at least they get their name listed."
3,Review for The Most Relaxing Classical Piano Music in the Universe from Amazon,"Great to get 2 CDs for the price, but a little disappointed in I wish more of the songs were more popular. I only liked about 6 of the songs out of the 2 CDs."
2,Relaxing Music?,"I was hoping to find some nice calming, relaxing music to play in my classroom and home. This was a little too instrumentally loud."
4,My First Insight into AC/DC with the Kerrang Files,"This was the very first book of it's kind I read about AC/DC. Pretty much all of which its are in its nontents are true. It starts from the pre-ac/dc days up to about 1994 just before the Ballbreaker album. I'm told there was an extended edition released after that, and this cover art Amazon shows is not the the same as my book. So it may exceed past 1995's ballbreaker album.It has a vast display of history, photos, informations and album guides. As well as some cool details, and the reviews written in Kerrang and Sounds over the years. Introduced by Megadeaths Dave Mustaine, each chapter of th ebook has a breif comment by muscions from various bands about what they think of AC/DC.A good read for any AC/DC fan. Probably a snore fest for someone not into them."
2,Quilt Set,"After reading reveiws, I ordered queen size for my full size bed it fit, the design is very pretty, and good quality. For the price was very happy and it matched very well. I am giving it a 4 becuase of having to get a bigger size.I dont beleive it is hand made, mostly machine stiching"
5,Exactly What I've Been Looking For,"I picked up this album a few days before a family vacation in 2009 and it has never left my MP3 player. Absolutely fantastic music, exactly what I've been looking for."
5,A call to arms for evangelicals,"It should be noted from Art Sippo's review that he is strongly Roman Catholic, so why should we be suprised that he does not come to the same conclusions about the Gospel as evangelicals do? What we should be suprised by is the fact Mr. Sippo could be so blind that he could see right past the cover where it says ""The Tie that Binds EVANGELICALS Together"". He is right about the fact that this isn't a defense of sola fide. But then again Dr. Sproul makes it quite clear that it isn't intended to be. This is a call for evangelicals to get their acts together. Mr. Sippo's anti-evangelical bias was the sole basis for his reveiw. I suppose my frustration towards Mr. Sippo was mine. Dr. Sproul couldn't make it clearer in the opening pages that this book is for the evangelical community. Mr. Sippo's review is essentially irrelevant for that reason."
1,Ugh...,"I normally really enjoy reading Sproul, but the Catholic-bashing and slamming of those friendly to the Catholic Church in this read is just too much. I have to say, my view of Sproul has changed a good deal after reading this, and not in a good way. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
4,Great Little Album!,I was very pleased to get my copy of this album.Robert did a good job on this and is a real tune smith in the vein of McCartney. Hope to hear more from this artist soon!
3,Technical note on this edition,"For some reason an Author alphabetization on my Kindle places this item under ""Georg"" instead of under ""Hegel""."
2,TEDIOUS AND DULL,"CONVERSATIONS WITH NEIL'S BRAIN is a glossary of brain parts packaged as dialogue between Calvin and his imaginary friend, Neil.The reading experience reminds me of a psycho-physiology course I took 25 years ago. Some exciting brain research had been done, but the old moss-backed professor ignored everything newer than about 1960.Calvin forfeited an opportunity to add snap, crackle, and pop to his tedious and dull lecture about brain physiology. Exciting things are happening, and he ignored much of it to rehash stuff from the 40s & 50s."
3,Slow read.,"It's hard to stick with this one. There's not much of a plot to draw you from chapter to chapter, and as instructional material, it drags out too much. Given learning as the objective for reading it, I'd rather just read something that cuts to the chase in a more overt, efficient, instructional manner.If you ever wondered what a friendly, open, unassuming neuroscientist or neurosurgeon might sound like if there were such a thing, you might read this to indulge that fantasy ;) These two authors have gone to great lengths to make their world accessible, which is a much appreciated effort by those of us in allied fields."
4,an answering prayer,"I am untutored when it comes knowing jazz,I bought this album on the strength of one cut from the encyclopedia sized compilation called THE VERVE STORY, Repetition,Disc#1.This album is like opening a window into another spirit dimension.Jazz and with it American culture was in such flux at that time. This album, with widely various styles recalls that sense of flux that resides in us still, that still seeks the eternal and makes jazz relevant today. That transformative presence is well enough mapped out in this set of recordings for me to begin to understand the man:immortal artist and tortured soul,both come out quite strongly. The sound recording is quite good for the time it was done.The label is quality. This is one of the longest running CDs I have, so its value."
1,Disappointed,Ordered this product for my son. It was broken out of the box. It had a short to the volume button so you can only hear the sound if you put your head directly to the speaker. [...]
1,NOT dual voltage!!!,"This product claims to be dual voltage, but it fried as soon as I plugged it in (we live overseas). We would have had to pay to return this defective product, and so it wasn't worth the bother. I will never order any products made by this brand again!"
4,A Great Summer Read,"Welcome to David's Bridge - a quaint little Virginia town where life is quiet and routine - or is it???In this her first Bailey Ferrol mystery, Pamela Kimmell has created a cast of intriguing characters and enough action to keep the book moving along nicely. You'll become hooked from page one, and ready for the next in the series by the time you are done! While one ""mystery"" is wrapped up by the end of the book, there is lots more going on to keep readers interested. Bailey is destined to become a favorite with mystery readers!This is definitely a book to take to the beach or while relaxing at the cottage!"
5,Gripping Writing,"""Cry Freedom"" is a novel that I'm passing around to all my friends. The story is truly enjoyable and the characters are unforgetable. I can't wait for the rest of the series!Perhaps my favorite part of the book was the gripping writing. I was impressed by the great descriptions. I felt like I was there!If you'd like a good book to add to your home library, I'd highly recommend this book. But make sure you clear a few hours from your calendar when you first pick it up . . . you won't want to put it down."
1,Cheaply made and NOT worth the money!!!,Connections were loose inside...so had to take cover off and inspect since it didn't come on after plugging in.Not as pictured. Foot is plastic not metal. Tires are thin and not substantial...toy like junk.Didn't inspire that keeping this was going to go well. Returned it the next day.Bought a Sears Craftsman. Quality was better and it worked without fiddling or hasseling around.
5,Great Pro charger for the home mechanic,"I had an old Schumacer, and the transformer finally gave out (It was over 10 years old). I purchased this one and could not be happier, TONS of features, easy to use and well built. Great performance for the price. If you are looking for an all-in-one battery charging solution for your garage, this is it."
1,Bad experience - didn't hold up over time,Seemed okay at first. Very handy with nice features. Then the current indicator failed. Then the timer eventually failed so it wouldn't shut off automatically. Then it didn't seem to charge very well so I checked the voltage and it was putting out much less than 12 volts. Maybe that's operation normal but doesn't make sense to me.
4,Works well for the money,"This wheeled charger works really well for the money. Not that it was at all difficult to put together, but if you are a ""read the instructions"" kind of person,...the instructions really leave alot to be desired. At one point, I had a screw fall inside the case and had to open it up to get it out.Two changes I would make... 1, I would have a hook to hold the cables when not in use. 2. I would have printed on it, more details about when to use the specific settings, and for how long. I dont use these every day, and always find myself wondering...should I fast charge? Or Slow Charge? And for how long on each? The insanity!!!!"
3,Should have shopped around more,"Bought this to replace an older model my husband had and this one was cheaper quality; the case wasn't as sturdy, the cables weren't as heavy quality either. I should have shopped around more and bought a better quality one."
3,Shumacher sucks,"Despite what owners manual says (DO NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT TO THE STORE) Call customer service for assistance, if you order this product from amazon they will tell you to call amazon. Timer bad on unit I received and told to call amazon or can order part and replace."
4,High Quality (with reservations),"This charger is a very nice charger. Prospective buyers should be aware (I was) that there is no automatic shut-off when battery is fully charged. There is a timer to regulate the length of charging time. I did not realize by the specs & write up that the ""tester"" was a simple volt meter. I already own 3 or 4 of those on different testers. Even though there is a convenience factor to the meter being mounted in the charger - I would not have paid so much more for it had I realized a voltmeter was all that it is. Also I would have liked to see a sturdier set of wheels & tires that would make it roll better in gravel & dirt. I am certain that the high quality of this charger will give me many years of service. The 3 year manufacturers warranty is great. Shipping time was excellent."
3,"Don't buy it for the tester/voltmeter, it is a joke","Someone said the tester was just a voltmeter, so I got it because a voltmeter is adequate for a quick test at the car. But it is a voltmeter that only goes up to 12.7 volts!!!! And it has no numbers on it. Despite the fact the meter says ""charging system"" condition on it, it is only capable of measuring battery voltage. The meter is pegged in the green with 12.7 volts. (resting Voltage for a fully charged battery) Which means if you believed the word ""good"" on the ""charging system"" meter, you'd think the alternator was charging, but it may not be. It only tells you if the battery is charged or not (with the car off, and no surface charge on it). The manual explains that is it testing the battery, but it is not labeled well on the charger, and in the advertising.Good, inexpensive manual charger, but VERY limited ""tester""."
2,I had high expectations on this product but found it to be poor right out of the box,"My unit arrived with the top section forced down as if it had been dropped whilst upside down and the edges had been buckled slightly. Since the Unit came shipped in excellent packaging with no indication of shipping abuse, I can only deduce the that manufacture has poor quality control or simply choose to send out the unit damaged in this way. On using the equipment, I experienced similar issues to other reviewers. I found that the unit's charge measurement rated poorly as follows; 8.43v at 2amps, 9.89v at 10 amps and 12.23v at 40 amps. The starter mechanism seems to function perfectly well but the internal fan does not work which limits my charge times to 10 min intervals to allow the unit to cool. I would hope this unit was just part of a bad batch as others seem to be experiencing good results but I'm inclined to believe that based on my initial findings, this unit will be up for return."
5,My husband loves this machine!,"It's the best money we've ever spent on a batter charger. He loves that he can wheel it around (he has a bad back), has a tester on it, and it charges batteries in no time. A very good product!"
5,Wondrous story writing for child and ault,"I first read this book when I was seven or eight and was on vacation at my grandmother's farm. I read a lot as a child, this book stands out so clearly from so many others. A wonderful, warm and funny book that I am going to enjoy reading to (and with) my boys this holiday season."
4,An excellent read,"Farley Mowat is a fine story teller. He presents an excellent story with an enjoyable insight into his relationship with various animals in addition to his dog, Mutt. His honest affection for all living things is apparent in all his writing. There are some folks that may have different opinions about the interaction of the critters he chooses to portray, but no one can deny the reality of those encounters. Mutt is an amazing dog, possessing almost human traits. That is something all of us see in our pets or other animals we observe. Farley Mowat has the ability to capture and portray those traits. Whether we agree or disagree, he presents reality honestly and skillfully. The author gets five stars, but the hard cover on low quality paper takes away from his masterpiece. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has ever observed animals, or had a pet."
5,A Boy and His Dog,This book is delightful. I have read it several times and given it as a present to small children. Life was wonderful in that time and place. Farley Mowat has a gift for describing happy memories.
5,"Great author from the great Belleville, Ontario, Canada.","Laugh-out-loud read-aloud. At first my 9 year-old son was skeptical when this arrived and I picked it for ""bedtime reading"", but then he took it to his room to finish it himself! Had to explain a few cultural and geographical things to my South Georgia-born son, but some themes are so universal they easily span time and space."
3,Didn't ring a bell,I love dog/boy books but this one was so unbelievable it just didn't ring true. It was amusing but I wouldn't recommend it.
4,the dog who wouldn't be,"i am reading this book with my dad and having a fun time.mutt,comes to this family for only a penny but brings a millon laughs.he did not think he was a dog so he did not ACT like a dog.when he didn't want to do something he pretented not to hear it.he would put on an expression that said,''i'm sorry,were you speaking to MOI? my two favorite parts are when the dad turns mutt blue and when the dad shot his gun and fell into the dich.you will have to read the book to find out the rest."
4,Chopper Attack is Great,Chopper attack is a great game. The only thing wrong with it is the controls wich are a little awkward but you easily get used to them. This is a great game and I highly recommend it
2,not THAT funny,"I didn't find this book particularly funny. It has its moments, sure, but the overall impression I got was ""outdated"": old jokes, every old Alaska cliche from sourdough to cheechako, *YAWN*, humor that may have been fresh once but is no longer. It's from 1997 and was not my first introduction to Alaskan writing. Maybe that's why. ;-)On a different note, I love Doogan's Nik Kane mysteries!"
2,pink and brown wall hanging,"These were alot bigger then I expected, make sure that you have a perfect spot for these, they look best clustered together like one on top and two on the bottom, they to were not the exact color I thought they would be, they were faded to."
5,Excellent,This is so cute and will look perfect on our baby girl's wall once the nursery is finished (only 9 more weeks!)
4,"Don't Let ""240 minutes"" Keep You Away!","If you haven't seen Jacques Rivette's ""La Belle Noiseuse"" I think it's worth a watch.Michel Piccoli, Jane Birkin, and Emmanuelle Béart in a story about a painter and how he gets his groove back.A long film which will sound incredibly boring when I tell you there are sustained sequences in which we just see sketching, but it is surprisingly engaging just because of those sequences, which turn out to be very dramatic.4 hours, yes. But it doesn't suffer much if you divide it up over a few days, and since there are few plot points, well, you'll pick up where you left off easily."
4,a Very Good self Help Book,"Martin Tomback presents a book that deals with Spiritual Growth. it deals with learning how to accept it to further understand your surroundings&also how to connect. this Book deals with Persoanl Purpose, Love, Money how you deal with controversey&other challenging pressure issues. this Book is geared toward Teens,but it has the kind of questions that no matter where you are in your life that you often wish a Book like this had come about a whole lot sooner. it makes you reflect on your own life&where you are as well as thinking about other lives that you impact&come into contact with. very detailed&the chapters have Questions&Answers at dealing with various situations. this is a Very Good self-Help Book."
5,helping to uplift others,"This book offers thoughtful advice and direction to others in order to help uplift the world, one person at a time. The author's warmth and sincerity are apparent on the pages. Rather than being full of information and how-to advice, Tombeck steers the reader to find truth and meaning from the context of one's own experiences and find ways to live a life guided by positive values."
5,An intriguing philosophical and spiritual conception of dealing with the modern world,"Spiriting Around: A Modern Guide To Finding Yourself by Martin ""Mark"" Tomback has as its focus an intriguing philosophical and spiritual conception of dealing with the modern world. Engaging readers with a highly informed and extensively studied documentation of his conclusive vision and understanding, Tomback offers Spiriting Around as an interpretive compendium of societal misleads and individual acceptance. Thoroughly ""reader friendly"" with its well crafted text, Spiriting Around is very highly recommended to all readers struggling with their own self-identity issues, particularly with respect to an expansive and expanded analytical understanding of the world's most often difficult objectives, controls, and constructs -- and what influence they might have on the individual."
2,The Dreaded Watchbird Is Coming,"I was just three years old when my mother took me to a book signing on Robertson Blvd. in Los Angeles. A man was seated at a small table and well-dressed women milled around him. The book was ""Manners Can Be Fun,"" with its bright yellow cover, and soon was joined by the Watchbird series. What sticks in my mind was the dreaded statement, ""This is a watchbird watching you. Were you a good child this month?"" Ugh. I can't imagine a young child today being inspired by such baloney."
5,Manners CAN be fun (and funny!),"Oh, how I have missed this book. My grandmother passed my mother's edition on to me when I was little, and its illustrations and funny stories have stayed with me all this time. I was heartbroken when I lost it, but as I didn't know the title or the author, I wasn't able to find it anywhere. This reprint has made me SO happy!"
5,The only antidote to psychobabble,"Lost in a sea of new-age mumblings, half-congealed PC semi-truths and ""value-neutral"" nonsense? Then, if you never do anything else for your kids, find a copy of this and Leaf's other gems and use them as often as you use the TV's remote control. They're full of the no-nonsense, boiled down ""rules to live by"" that so well defined the simpler ages gone by. To agree with another reviewer, this and the others probably would be banned today. But, when you consider who it is that bans books along with what's acceptable and what isn't by today's standards, it might be time to resurrect ol' Munro and let him have another go at our kids. Until somebody with the wisdom and resource to do that comes along and does, a well-used copy suits me just fine, thank you."
4,An Old Favorite,I fondly remember this book that I read as a child over fifty years ago. I was looking for a way to address issues about manners with my five year old grandson and rediscovered this book. He clearly got the messages Leaf imparted and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author did an excellent job of succicntly and imaginatively presenting the rules of getting along with others and the consequences of not doing so. The terminology and pictures Leaf used to describe poorly mannered children was indelibly printed in my mind and has lost none of its charm.
5,They are learning to say Please!,"I owned MANNERS CAN BE FUN as a youngster.I don't know what happened to it, but as the grandchildren came along I realized that this was something they can use. And now they do. I purchased five copies from Amazon that are being distributed. Their parents are grateful and there is less stress during their visits."
1,Broken Upon Arrival,"I am an amputee and rely on crutches to move around. My old crutches were broken and were dangerous for me to use when I ordered these. When I got the crutches I found them broken. The part that goes under your arms was not connected on either crutch. When I attempted to use them the tops would come off and I would loose my balance. Out of necessity I was forced to glue them on until I can find a new set of crutches. I am very dissatisfied with this product and would not buy this item in the future.Item: Duro-Med Laminated Wood Crutches, Medium"
5,Not just for 12 year old boys!,"This expertly written adventure tale is still as amusing and ""page-turning"" for the adult reader as it was when it was first made required reading in junior high school. Also makes a great book to be read aloud to youngsters... Harry Potter has wizards, Jack Hawkins has pirates! This edition is particularly desirable with the breathtaking illustrations by NC Wyeth."
1,Awful!,"How can this possibly be a classic? Most of the time I had no idea what on earth the characters were saying. It's all in some kind of pirate-jive lingo. Practically a foriegn language. I thought that this was a childrens book. If I read this at the age of let's say 8, it would put me off reading for life. And it is so slow to start. I didn't enjoy reading this book and I was very disappointed. The drama is weak, the narrative is weak and boring. I felt nothing for the hero Hawkins. And towards the end it kind of built up to a big climax that never happened. I'd like to believe I read a fake version of Treasure Island and there is a much better and real version out there. But perhaps I should accept that this book, cherished and highly regarded by a lot of people, just didn't entertain me one iota."
1,THE SHIP HAS SUNK!,"The entire seventh grade at my school read this book. 3 out of 356 kids actually enjoyed it! I was one who did not, and I read at a 12th grade reading level! This book was pathetic, except for the premise."
4,Yo ho ho a good book,Jim hawkens a yong boy helps run a inn that is his familys. But when the old priate Billy Bones who has been living in the inn dies. Jim finds him self in trouble. he takes the book to the docter. the docter opens it and finds a treaser map.Than jim sets on a adventure to find it. the story has lots of action and priates. I say its a pretty good book.
4,Treasure Island,Ifound the book Tresure Island an exciting book like when Jim and his crew faught the pirates. Some parts of the story were boring like when theytalked about mad dog's adventure and the treasure map.Overall for the most part I enjoyed this book becauswe of the adventure I have read many books like this and find them average. I learned many things reading this book about Jim and the pirates I found this book adventurous and for the most part exciting
5,Great book,This is a great story in a great format/edition. I'm excited to give this to my son for Christmas and experience this story with him.
5,As good as expected.,An excellent book as expected and an interesting plot. I enjoyed the book as I expected I would and will keep it for another read in the future.
5,Defined high seas adventure,"Treasure Island is a non stop thriller of excitement, pirates and mutiny. This exciting classic was told by the young Jim Hawkins about the finding of a map to Treasure Island. The enchanted young buck gets the map from the dying Billy Bones. He later finds that it is the infamous map of the legendary Captain Flint's never ending treasure. He takes the lucky find to his friend Doctor Livesey and they were off to sea. They find the most trustworthy sailor by the name of Long John Silver. He gets them the most seaworthy crew and all seems well until the Captain warns them that the crew is untrustworthy and mutiny is in the air. Swashbuckling abounds! They are in for an adventure that they must see through to the end. Few thrillers today can match all the twists and turns of this legendary tale. Yo ho!"
5,"""Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!""","This book is bar none one of the best adventure stories of all time. Whether you are young, old, or young at heart this book has something for everyone. Join young Jim Hawkins on the quest for pirate treasure and marvel at his treacherous & motley companions like Long John Silver. Robert Louis Stevenson is a master story teller in terms of pacing, tone, and his characters. Although it was written more than a hundred and twenty years ago, this book is still considered a classic for good reasons. Do yourself a big favor and READ IT TODAY!"
4,Treasure Island,"I thought this book was a really great book. It was full of adventure and action. Even though this book had alot of action and adventure some chapters were not that exciting.This book was about battles between pirates and a group of people who both are trying to claim treasure for themselves.In this book you discover a moroonar,a boy named Jim Hawkins,a one legged pirate and a man named Captian Flint. I reccomend everyone should read this book because of its action,adventure, and mystery."
3,This is a real classic,This book is for people who love the classic books! You should not read this book if you don't like pirates.
3,"Dense read, but exciting.","Some of the language was tough to get through, this is not a fast read. But it's an exciting adventure nonetheless."
3,A Classic,Once you read this it is with you forever. It changes how one looks at themselves and the world. It is a classic.
2,duh!,"started out very good. as the plot thickened, the details disappeared, making full comprehension difficult. ending incomplete.started out very"
5,Treasure Island,"GREAT BOOK, A CLASSIC!!! Good read for all ages!!! Even if you've read it before GET this and read it again, this takes you to Treasure Island all that's missing is the smell of salt water"
4,Timeless fun story,"I first read this many decades ago. Now as a Sr. citizen, I still like it. Particularly interesting to see how Stevenson wrote about violence in the 19'th century."
4,Treasure Hunt,"Treasure IslandA young boy named Jim who has lived all his life with his parents working at the Admiral Benbow had a normal life. But when Jim's father dies and the guest they have Captain Billy Bones dies he has to take charge. So when he finds a map in Bill's trunk he sets off with a crew to Treasure Island. After arriving at the island he encounters more than he bargained for. Robert Louis Stevenson put together a great book that every age would adore. He starts with details to make the story clear and then takes of on a fascinating story. Jim Hawkins & Long John Silver are classic imagination. Robert Louis Stevenson combines action, detail, and history for a slam pack thriller that everyone should read. The theme of the book is that nothing turns out how you want it to. The theme is kind of weak but the book is still good."
3,This is a great childrens book!,This book is about a young boy who finds an old map. many mean pirates are after this map. It is the map to Treasure Island. Here is where a whole bunch of treasure is suppossed to be. The boy and his friends go on a search for the treasure btu are side-tracked by the mean mob of pirates. The boy and his friends fight long and hard to get the pirates off of them so they can get the treasure. You will have to read the book in order to see who gets the treaure. This book is a thriller. It is a great bedtime story to read with your children. I think they will love it! check it out if you would like!
2,Not a good book don't get it. It is really confusing,This book is really confusing. I got lost a lot in it. It doesn't really make any sense and it is kind of a band book.
2,Booooooooooorrrrrrrring!!!,"I had to read this for a 7th grade class... I got what was happening (mostly), but it was the dumbest story. There was no point and i was about to fall asleep halfway through- Totally boring! Save your time, or if you do get it, DON'T get the old version- the conversations are even harder to understand."
2,Not really a children's book,"I just read this ""classic of children's literature"" at age 49, and I found it very hard to follow. It depicts a number of evil and frightening adults (men), with a boy ""saving the day."" I think it should be read by teenagers and adults, rather than 9- to 12-year-olds, since it is so difficult to follow."
3,For Kids,"I saw this available and thought to myself ""Hey, it's a classic"". I thought it would be a treat. So predicable, it was painful. My guess is it was for a childrens audience or there just wasn't a lot of choices to read back when this book came out. My opinion: move on, do not waste your time."
4,Fantastic novel,"Treasure Island is the best pirate novel I've ever come across. Although I must also add this is the only pirate novel I've come across. That being my background, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it really is a wonderful story. Some of the technical jargon gets confusing, but with the dictionary function on the Kindle it is absolutely a breeze."
5,Timeless adventure,"""Treasure Island"" is the adventures of a young boy, Jim Hawkins, caught between pirates and treasure hunters. Long John Silver, the one-legged cook befriends Jim while being in cahoots with the mutinous crew. Captain Smollett is the honest but strict commander of the ship commissioned by Squire Trelawney to take Jim to the treasure trove on a map given to Jim by a dying seaman.It's been redone many times, but this is the original, and the worthy sire of lesser works (that can still be pretty good, like Muppet Treasure Island). The language is a little old fashioned, but only makes the story stronger. The values of loyalty, courage, mercy, and audacity figure large in this book, and it has a much more positive tone than is popular in current fiction.A great adventure and first rate reading for kids of almost any size.E. M. Van Court"
3,Treasure Island,"I read this book back in my seventh grade literature class and thought I would give it a revisit. Honestly, it was very underwhelming. The action was bland and the tension between good vs. evil withered away near the end. Also, it was very difficult to fully understand the book without looking up each nautical term and pirate jargon found in every line about halfway through the book. Treasure Island was a nice little blast from the past, however, I think I am going to stick with contemporary fiction from now on, or at least something a bit more exciting."
5,Such an adventure!,"I love reading classics and this up there as one of the best ones. Jim Hawkins was described well, as well as other characters, but once I started reading it was hars to stop and I think many different people woud like this exciting tale!!!!!!!!:)"
4,Great Classic Holds Up Well; Not Just for Kids,The only reason I read this was because I downloaded it months ago to my Kindle. I hadn't read it since a kid; no reason to. But it holds up well. Great suspense and amazing characters. Long John Silver is the best good/bad guy I've read in a long time. Bravo. Wish RLS was still writing.
3,Treasure island,Was a great read I enjoyed it a great deal I hope if you haven't read it that you will give it a try
4,Great but hard book!,Awesome very hard vocab!!!!! I LOVED the book!!! It was a book of fighting. It was a very good book though many people died.
4,Treasure island,Treasure island is a good classic book that gave me hours of reading enjoyment. All the pirate language made it hard to read sometimes but gave it realism that made it enjoyable.
2,Not sure,The it wasn't really my genre type though I can't blame the book for that but if you like pirates and adventures this is the book for you
4,Classic Adventure for All Ages,"A childhood favorite to revisit in the cold days of winter or anytime you're looking to escape to another world. Stevenson is craftsman of the finest cloth, weaving a tale of pirates, murder, mutiny, and fortune.The language and imagery carry readers away with young Jim Hawkins in a tale offering an uncomplicated morality of being careful what you wish for and asking what is the price of treasure."
3,As advertise,"As advertise. Nothing Else to Say. Why does amazon enforce so many words in a review, all we need to say it that it worked or not"
4,Treasure island,I think this book had a lot of dignity. It really kept me hanging over my bed because it was so interesting. I just love this book! I chose this rating because it was really really good. I wouldn't say prefect because it's really old but it really is a big hit for today! I just absolutely loved it!!!!!!!!!!
4,A Great Family Book,I love to read adventure books with piertes and sored fights I haven't read this book before but Im loving it.
1,amazon kindle edition is not completer,"Just ordered and downloaded this book to my pc. The book is not complete only 27 pages long! What's going on? Granted, I got it for free because it was advertised as a free book, but I really liked this book when I read it in Highschool and was looking forward to reading it again. This was a total waste of time!"
4,A book of treasures,"As a child, I only listened to someone reading this adventure to me. On reading this book for the first time as an adult, I found the story full of intrigue and drama. An entertaining 'boys own' adventure. This version contains many wonderful 'old english' words and phrases currently missing from modern works. Because of my enjoyment in reading this book , I will follow up by reading 'Silver' which was published recently."
4,Good entertainment,"There have already been enough critical reviews on this book, so I'll just vote with my 4 stars and say that I enjoyed this book very much."
4,Don't judge a book by its cover,"I had read the book before I purchased it. I love the story. When I received the book through amazon there was significant water damage and the paint was peeling of the cover. It was said to be ""new."" Perhaps it was ruined during shipping, but my other two Penguin Hardcover Classics in the same order were perfectly intact. Whatever the case may be, I was still saving money purchasing through Amazon."
2,Bad idea,"""Treasure Island"" is a classic. Why foul it up by makingit 'easier to read'? That is just being condescending toyoung readers, and evidently, going by one of the otherreviews, they didn't do a very good job of THAT, even.Read the original, skip any of the adaptations...."
2,"Laborious, wearisome, boring","Too many unnecessary details - a chore to read. Was reading this with a group of 8th graders and we couldn't wait to get done with it - no one liked it. Too many times after reading a page, we would all go - HUH?? - what did the author just say?You know there have been more novels written since then- why do students have to keep reading the same ones their grandparents read when they were in school?"
4,Exciting and Suspensefull.,"I highly recommend reading Treasure Island to anyone who likes suspenseful classics. Although Robert Lewis Stevenson wrote it in 1883, the classic is still in print and is appropriate for anyone in grades 5-8. The journey begins with no major problems, but when Jim and the rest of the crew approach their destination everyone on the ship gets their own idea of the way things are going to work. Throughout the story Jim Hawkins, the main character, takes risks for the well-being of himself and his colleagues. Finally, his shipmates lose faith in him but he prevails. The events that take place in this story are extremely exciting and surprising. This book is one of my favorites and should be read by all."
4,A great book to read to your children.,"I chose this book to be my first attempt at reading a chapter book to my daughter. The short chapters (12 pages average) are great for our one chapter a night bedtime reading. We often talk about the young hero, Jim, and what he had done the night before. She follows the plot well but the vocabulary promts many questions. The overall story is wonderfull and continues to hold her attention."
3,The book wasn't the worst I've ever read!!,"I thought that it was a good book. I liked how the author described all of the places they visited and each of the different attacks. I just didn't like how Long John changed his character so often. He should have remaind the same more, even though it was incorperated with the plot."
5,Treasure Island Matey!,"Treasure Island I believe is not well suited for youngsters. They don't understand action, adventure on the high seas, lots of rum, cutlass-bearing pirates, ships, and mutiny like an older read would. Older readers have seen a bit of that. If your older and still love action and adventure, zest for life, I won't steer ya wrong matey!, read Treasure Island. Now avast ye landlubber! and get off my ship before I keel-haul ya to the briny deep!"
4,Pirate fun for all ages,"Stevenson's classic treasure hunt is a story that will always be remembered in cultural history. Generations of readers can easily relate to Jim's adventures, and will find it easy to navigate through the narrative itself, despite evolving vocabulary, speech patterns, and usage. Full of charming characters such as Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins, adventure, treasure, pirates and intrigue, ""Treasure Island"" is a treat for all ages."
5,Treasure Island,a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.
3,Great attention to detail; bit drawn out out at times,"This is one of those classic books that I don't recall ever having read. There is great attention to detail and the characters are well developed although I did find at times that it was a bit too drawn out. I was grateful for being able to look up many of the old words words easily on the Kindle, and am glad that I finally got around to reading this pirate classic."
4,A good read,Great to read this one - prolly would never hav bought I so getting on the free list at kindle was a great find
4,This is a very fun adventure.,"Stevenson was a classic author. When authors like Robert Louis Stevenson write, the characters and scenes come to life in your mind. I recommend this story for young readers too."
5,Treasure island,"Reread it for second time and then it's follow up Silver. Good read. The original book had a great ending, Silver picks up from this point."
3,Exciting and adventurous,"I think most people have a pre-conceived notion about this book and its characters, but I read it for the first time recently and found that most of what I thought about it was wrong; the book and characters were both better than I had anticipated.The characters in this book are well developed and well written. Stevenson's use of dialogue is what really sets this book apart; you can tell from their dialect exactly what type of person each of the characters is and which group they fit into.The most interesting character isn't the narrator, but Long John Silver, the evil pirate. Silver is eminently adaptable and manages to charm everyone he comes into contact with by telling them what they want to hear; he reminds me of many of today's politicians.Overall, this is definately worth the read."
2,"Good book, of course, difficult to use audio link.","Bought it because my daughter is reading it in school, and wanted it with the audio link so we could listen in the car. However, we could not figure out how to get the audio link to work.Disappointing."
3,Dee funder,I'm so glad I read it. It's a classic and very interesting. Everyone should read it at least once for sure .
3,A classic,"I found this book very interesting. What's more, it was free to read on the kindle. I would recommend it."
1,go way,"Sorry I'm only ESL . I don't understand what the book talk about ,for me is nothing ,i will deleted it read it after 10 years when my english is better"
5,Treasure Island,When first published this was considered an exciting story of English pirates. Today it reads as an interesting insight into old English culture and an interesting sea tale. Worth the read if you are interested in fictional history
5,It's a Classic!,What can you say... This book is a classic for a reason! It's a great read. It amazes me how much our current ideas about pirates are based on the characters in this book.
4,my 6yo loved it,"I have the softback version, and my 6yo found it and read it in one day, he loved it. I don't normally ""approve"" of adaptations of classics like this, but it is about pirates, afterall, and I do want him to read! : He told me that he liked the larger font size in the book. I haven't read this version myself - I wish I had time to preview everything my kids read, but that's just not practical."
3,My first book for my Kindle,"First of all I have to say that English is not my first language and that is the reason why I gave this book a 3 star rating, it was a little hard to read because it is written in an old fashioned way that I am not used to. Another thing that kinda made the book less enjoyable (and this is not the author's fault) is the fact that there's been a lot of pirate movies lately and most of them seem to resemble certain parts of the book, I guess if I hadn't seen the movies that wouldn't have been an issue. Overall I'd say that it is a very good book and great for young people to start to get to know the classics."
4,Nice,This was a nice quality book although I guess I didnt realize that it was a smaller size book than what you would normally think. The finishes were very nice and liked the bookmark feature.
3,Started off bla,We ordered this for our 9 yr old daughter who liked the book but said it started off very bla but was an okay book by the end.
2,NOT my cup of tea,"I had to read Treasure Island for class. The book was published in 1883. The main character,Jim, suffers losses at an early age. This influences him to go on a ship to find Captain Flint's treasure. There are several people on this ship, some that Jim can trust can some that he really shouldn't. Some of these people use others just to get what they want. I did not like the book at all. It could not keep my attention. I found the book quite boring. The wording is confusing and I had somewhat of a hard time reading the story and fully understanding it. It took me a while to finish the book because I just could not read it. Personally it has way too much violence for me. But, it does teach good life lessons such as,be careful who you trust,some people will do anything for money,and many more. All of the problems helped the main character learn these lessons. I would not suggest this book to young children or people who don't like violence and pirates."
3,enjoyable and timeless but ultimately overhyped.,"It my opinion that RLS excels in the short story/novella genres, and is somewhat lacking in momentum in longer stories and novels."
5,Well worth the price,"Perfect condition; great price. Better than I had expected. The order was shipped quickly, no hassle. I bought another one just after I had received the first!"
1,Chapter 5 missing!,"If I had known that I could buy this from Barns and Nobles for $4.99, I would have gotten it there. This book was missing a chapter and my son can't even read it. Now I have to go out and buy another one."
3,Treasure Island,"Treasure Island was a good read but you should read it more than once if you wish to understand this book. The talk is difficult to understand and inturpret. Another dissapointing thing is the ending. You'd think that this exciting of a book would have a better ending. Silver is an EXCELENT charector and when he wasn't in the book I felt a bit dissipointed Also it is soooo much differant than the movies, but better.~Bonnie"
3,Shiver me soul,"This book is at turns dreadfully dull and blood-poundingly enthralling. Be prepared to plow through the mire of overly detailed passages relating tactical events to get to the great character-building climaxes. The people in this story were to me so much more interesting than the plot.It may be my own deficiency that I wasn't able to enjoy the action in this adventure story, but it seemed to drag on and on, and many times I had to force myself to re-read paragraphs to understand the development of a situation. When it comes to the characters in the book, however, I am transported to a movie set in my mind. I appreciate the impact this book has had on swashbuckling tales and our perception of pirate culture. For that we are indebted to Stevenson's imagination. I'd just rather see the film."
5,Narrative storytelling at its best (pickled in brine n' rum),"Though often marketed to 'young adults,' Stevenson's masterful account of treachery and treasure is ageless in readership. With equal amounts of suspense, 'violence' (yes, violence!) and surprise, Stevenson draws the reader into a story with characters and plot equal to the best of contemporary thrillers. If you wish seafaring adventure and wonderfully lively narrative, read this classic. Then read Perfect Storm or Moby Dick."
4,Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson,"This story is narrated by a young boy, Jim Hawkins. He helps an old pirate, Billy to find a buried treasure. They are on a ship with pirates, one of them being a one-legged pirate named Long John Silver. Long John Silver is a hero in some eyes but a villian to most - but truly an adventurous sea dog. There is alot of action in this book - the good guys vs the bad guys. This is a good book but the vocabulary was diffiult to understand because of the time it was written. I recommend this book to people who like adventure stories. It is a book you should keep because you will read it over and over throughout the years."
4,Treasure Island,An interesting story of adventure every time you read it. Good for young and old alike. Nice illustrations add to the overall impression of the book.
4,Treasure Island,I thoght this book had a theme that you could never get tired of.There where a few sections that got a bit boring and I just wanted to get to the end of the chapter.A treasure hunt whith a lot of action and adventure is just the type of book that a 13 year old boy would want to read. I don't like reading that much at all but this book kept me hooked. I don't want to give to much away but I can say that the pirates and a few other people did a few.....ODD things throught the book. The key word of this book is mutiny. This is a great action book that makes you have to think. When two groups of pirates are on one island fighting over one treasure you get one fun book.
1,Tresure Island,"""Treasure island"" was a hard book to understand at my age (12). Its sentences were written in old English, which got you confused. The sentences were also pretty long. There word choice was hard and confusing. On page 118 the 4th sentence has like three hard words. The description was good but at times the plot was confusing. A significant event that happened was when the mutineers attacked their ship and killed Flint.My personal opinion of this book is I thought it was bad and hard to understand. It was written so far back that the old English was so confusing. It seemed like there were like ten different things happening at one time. So a good age for a reader of this book would be around thirteen and up. Twelve year olds could read it to if you're a good reader. But if your not that great of a reader than you might think the book is confusing like I did. So all in all, I would give the book a three on a one through ten scale."
1,Not enough richness for me...,"I read the first 40 pages or so and it didn't grab me. The narrator isn't described, there's no texture, no detail. It just jumps into the story too quickly and I didn't feel anything about the characters or interest in the plot."
1,hell boring!!!,"this book is mad boring!!! how can they even publish this??? i have to read this book for school and that is why i flunk my test. even the movie is boring!! if you want to buy this book, you can use it for a bedtime story. if it is not for your bedtime story, it is no use. so listen to me and don't buy this book!!"
1,The Hispinula sinks,our entire class read this novel and not one of us could understand a single word that was written. The constant change in place become confusing untul they got to Treasure Island. How could someone fall asleep in a coracle and an apple barrel? People have told me it was a classic when they thought it was terrible. At the end of the book I had no idea if Ben Gunn was on the ship or still on Treasure Island
4,Fun story - I missed out by not reading as a kid,"I never read this book as a kid, and I don't even remember seeing the movie. I have a whole new view on eating at Long John Silvers now!I thought it was an enjoyable story, albeit a bit far-fetched that young Jim was so capable, and that Long John could get around so well on a crutch. Despite that, it was a fun read, and one I will recommend to my kids."
5,great read,"A great adventure read. I do wish I had read it when I was 12, but I think there were elements of the book that I would not have picked up on at that age that I enjoyed now. I'll suggest it to my boys when they are old enough to enjoy it!"
5,What characters!,A good study in human character. I read this book to my children as a bedtime story over a couple months.
4,Good read,I am going back and re-reading some of the classics. Very good book especially if you like the water and pirate tales.
5,Still a great read,"Still an amazing book, can always be reread over and over no matter how old you are.A classic that can be a bit tough for some readers who aren't used to it."
5,What's not to like?,"This is a classic, to which all other pretenders are compared. It's all there: pirates, hidden treasure, good guys, bad guys, guys you're just not sure about. Great book for middle schoolers with strong reading skills through adults. The Kindle edition is sure handy!"
3,"Doesn't deserve the ""classic"" title","I enjoyed Treasure Island alot, till they landed on it. The first scenes in the inn and on the ship are great and full of possibility, but as soon as the pirates mutinied I lost intrest in it. Nothing but geography and strange descriptions and the ending was very unsatisfying. This isn't by far the worst book I've read, but it wasn't that great."
5,Great classic,"Michael Prichard's narration is flawless. The story is gripping, laden with suspense, and still fresh despite the events in question taking place in the 18th century. The ""sea-going man with one leg"" may even give you nightmares."
4,treasure island,Treasure Island is a good book. The story is interesitng but can get confusing. There are so many twists in the story you never know what is going to happen. If you like adventure you would love this book.
5,Reliving my childhood...,"Even though I'm a senior citizen I still enjoy and take pride in my ability to stay abreast of the times. I have an iPhone 4 and love the different things I can do with my 'Smart Phone'. Besides being a fantastic phone, I can also check my mail, look up something on the internet, check my accounts at the bank, download hundreds of applications and as a personal little satisfaction-- I downloaded 'Treasure Island' to re-read on my Kindle app..."
1,Terrible,The all time worst book a teacher ever made me read I wouldn't make my worst enemy read this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Ho Hum Ho,"Well, mates. I must say the first few chapters were interesting and I was really expecting something to happen to keep my interest but the ship sunk for me. About 3/4 left to read I really had to row hard to get through it.......boring. Maybe for kids its ok. Don't recall any profanity."
1,A real pocket size pocketbook!,My negative review is based on one major fact. There is no where in the description that the book is 6 1/4 x 4 inches in size with only one illustration. Thus it was not at all appropriate for the three little girls ages 8-10 who were to receive it this Christmas.
2,"Not great, not horrible","Let's face it: this is a children's novel. It's designed for children to read and think they're reading an adult novel without realizing that that's what they're supposed to think.The problem is, the language and the way they talk may make it hard for children to get through. Basically, Treasure Island has lost its target audience.However, it is still a cute adventure romp that has inspired many of its kind (with or without Johnny Depp). Read it as a classic, not anything else."
2,Too long and boring,It's too long and boring. I think this book is not suitable for Hong Kong students in primary six. It makes us sleep. There are a lot of difficult vocabulary words. I wish there were more pictures and easier vocabulary words. We shouldn't buy this book. It's more boring than the Bible. I prefer to play computer games.
4,A timeless classic at an inexpensive price,"This classic by Robert Louis Stevenson should have a place on everyone's shelf. When we think of tales of pirates and buccaneers, we can not help but thing of Captain Flint and Long John Silver.Why this edition? Although this is by no means a keepsake, it is an inexpensive and well-done edition. It is unabridged and has an illustration of the treasure map as well as illustrations from other scenes in the book (such as Jim Hawkins' meeting Ben Gunn). It is easy to carry around when you are out on vacation or doing some hiking. You can't do that with a keepsake.The story is written in narrative fashion, mostly from the perspective of Hawkins, but sometimes from Dr. Livesey's point of view. Either way, it is fast paced and hard to put down.I would recommend this edition to anyone not willing to invest in a hardcover keepsake. You can not go wrong."
3,a bit misleading,The book is nice and i enjoy the illustrations. But i really only got it for the audiobook download since you can get this book for free. Turns out the audiobook is just a download from librivox. So kind of a ripoff but oh well.
4,A pirate - adventure story,"""Treasure Island"" is a great book which shows the way pirates really behaved. It also tells a story about the big courage of a boy who had only served in an inn his entire life. The book shows that everyone can rescue the world or at least help an old lady across the street if he only believes in himself.Thomas Koren E8/I"
2,Eh.....,It is a semi interesting book. I personally love to read about pirates. But the book was somewhat boring and it went really slow. The book is always throwing you off with big vocabulary. It's not bad. I just personally don't like the book that much.
3,"A Classic, But Not My Favorite","Since it is a classic adventure story, Treasure Island was on my ""must read"" list. I don't regret reading it, but I know it will be a long time before I read it again.While the story was good, the writing was uneven. In the beginning there is a lot of detail (almost too much at times) but yet by the end the story feels rushed. The amount of detail early on made it drag at times, but the lack of detail towards the end made the ending feel abrupt. It felt as if Stevenson had spent so much time on the beginning, that by the time he got to the end he just wanted to be finished with it.That said, I still think it is a book people should read once. Like with most classics there are lessons to be learned from this book.Prioritize it on your reading list accordingly."
5,Great Imagination!,"The author is indeed a great master, who can plot this story in such a way that a reader feels that he has to finish this story as soon as possible.Without such a story, the life in that time would be totally forgot. This is the real-life treasure for civilization."
3,My Review of Treasure Island,"I thought this book was good, usually classics are, but I didn't find enough action or twists and personally my favorite character was either Ben Gunn or Long John Silver. Overall I give this book 3 stars for reasons I've already stated."
3,Classic,Another classic book that is a good ready and takes me back to child hood when I first read it
3,Classic,"I am a sucker for classics, but this one is a hard read for me because I am not getting sucked in right away. Could be just me."
5,A Classic and Kindle - A Great Pair,"Amazon makes it great to enjoy the classics on Kindle. Treasure Island was my first e-book on my Kindle that I received at Christmas. First, let me comment on the fact that there are numerous FREE e-books for your Kindle; this includes such classics such as Treasure Island. Second, I had long forgotten how enjoyable are the classics of literature of which Treasure Island is one. I greatly enjoyed what I believe is the greatest pirate story every written. If you compare all of the modern pirate stories and especially the movies you can readily see that they are based on Treasure Island.Sometimes old is better than new and this is the case with the Kindle version of Treasure Island or in fact the hard copy as well. 15 men on a dead man's chest, yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!!"
5,What a great story!,"I got a Kindle for Christmas and decided to read the ""free"" classics that I haven't read in a very long time. Based on the reviews of this book, I read it first. What a great story...it was hard to put down. I Love the dictionary reference feature on the Kindle, it was so handy to use when reading this book."
3,a classic,"I don't remember having read this before, and I enjoyed the story. I had a bit of trouble getting into the story. The language differences from when this was written until now were hard to follow at times: different spellings and letters replaced with an apostrophe made it hard to lose myself in the story. I'll give it 3 stars."
4,loved Treasure Island,"I may have read this im my childhood, but I honestly don't remember. I can say that, as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's fascinating to see so many familiar elements of pirate lore, and then realize ""wait, this book is where that stuff originated!"". All in all, a wonderful read."
4,beautiful illustrations,I bought a used copy but it is still in great shape.The illustrations are wonderful although the text does't really need them.
2,Not a great book,"This novel was very descriptive and original, but dragged on too long. I found myself skimming chapters at a time because I became so bored with the content. This book was definately not for me. Don't necessarily let this review discourage you from reading it, though. I recommend reading the first few chapters. By then you'll know the general impression of the novel, and can decide whether to continue or not."
2,I just had to read this book,"I read the story of Long John Silver (supposedly written by himself) written by Bjorn Larsson that is a wonderful story, but at the end of this book it says that if you want to read the last attack of Long John Silver you have to read Treasure Island because if it was written once he will not write it again, that's why I had to read this book.This book has about 300 pages or so, but it goes out of the main story so many times that you don't remember the story, compared with the story of Long John Silver this book has nothing to do."
3,Uh...,"It had a great plot, it just wasn't narrated in a very captivating way. I finished it, but had to force myself to keept reading, keeping in mind that it might get better. I just don't get it---the tale of Jim Hawkins, who goes off to sea, and uncovers a conspiracy involving one of the people on the ship, intense fight sequences and stealthy hiding---it should be great. But I found it a drag."
4,Adventure all the way,"A timeless classic, written by Robert Louis Stevenson was a great book for those of us who like adventure. The book begins at the Admiral Benbow Inn, which Jim Hawkins, the main character works. Suddenly, from out of the blue a rough sea faring man appears named Billy. That is when the real adventure begins!! Jim and his mother find a treasure map in a dead customers sea trunk. Jim got a couple of respectable people together and they bought a ship named the Hispaniola and set of sail for Treasure Island, not knowing the problems that lay before them. I think the author wanted the them to be, be careful whom you trust. I fully enjoyed this book and I think you will too. To find out the rest read, Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson."
1,Didn't last long,This unit failed 2 months after purchase. The surge protected side lost power and would not reset. I tried to get it replaced but got no response. So I replaced it with a more expensive brand known for it's reliability (ATP).
5,Very reliable,"I just had the video circuit board repaired in my TV due to a lightning outage (1 to 2 seconds) for $245.00. I have had this unit in service for about six months for my home theater system including my TV. It handled several lightning interruptions flawlessly. I know there are better units specifically made for home theater systems, but they cost a LOT more than this one. Just make sure that you don't overload the unit with too much equipment (or buy a larger unit). Add up the amperage of your equipment. Especially protect these new HDTV systems. The repairs are astronomical and these lightning hits can really cause them damage.My computer is protected with a larger UPS. Ask any repairman - they will tell you that surges and drop-outs keep them in business!"
5,dont hesitate,"I was really hesitant to buy this title, because of the negative reviews here on amazon. I decided to buy and decide for myself if the print quality was sufficient. I have a Yamaha dvd player and a Samsung led television and I did not find any flaw on this release. I found the white stripes on the print charming, a reminder that the medium used to be a film. So my advice is do not hesitate just go right ahead and buy if you are interested."
5,Lucky pennies and hot chocolate book,Read this book when my kids were young and always remembered it. It was worthy of my personal book collection. I am surprised that these copies are going for up to 400 dollars each. Found this for regular price. A sweet story.
1,Didn't work out.,"I ordered these back in May of 2008, and these are still very comfortable and mostly in one piece. The only problem with these were within the first couple of months of wearing them, the container inside actually cracked and broke, rendering the whole ""idea"" useless.You're paying the extra dollar for the gimmick of being able to carry liquids in your shoe, but if the container isn't durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of everyday life, then I can't recommend these shoes.And even if the containers were durable enough, their capacity is very limited."
3,Holds less than a shot,"Sandals are comfortable and look good. I did purchase these hoping for a bit more fluids to be held in the bottom. Only expect a shot (standard bar shot) of liquid to be held in each sandal. With that this is more of a novelty item, so the price should reflect a novelty price."
3,Awesome - but not for long,"I bought these immediately when I saw them for sale in a surf shop. It comes with a little funnel to make filling the flasks easier. I kept them filled with whiskey, and there were several times when it came in handy, especially after parties, or when the bars closed and I was walking home (lol). Plus, it's pretty funny to pull off your shoe while your at a store or something and pour whiskey out of the heel into your mouth (kind of gross, but a great conversation starter). The flask broke after about a month - I noticed a small puddle of whiskey at my feet while in a restaurant. The shoes were pretty comfy though...those lasted a while. I figure they're about the same price as regular Reef's, why not just buy the Drams?"
2,Leaks.....,"I have several pairs of Reefs...hands down the best sandals out there..but I will be darned if these things leaked after the first fill up..didnt know till I was headed to the Pearl Jam concert...filled a little Jamesons in there..and put them back on...drip drip drip...other than that, they are a very comfortable sandal...but reef makes better utility sandals...the bottle opener ones, stash box, fuzzy and the golf ones are way better and useful than the flask....shop around..."
2,It was not as expected,"It was not the kind of sandal you expected, the finishes seem to be for women and not men."
2,Good idea...not so good product.,"The idea of having your flip flop hold some ounces of liquid is a fun idea, however, after wearing the sandals for almost a month off and on, the container shattered and the area that is right under your arc became very uncomfortable. I would stick to the sandals with the bottle top opener."
2,are you kidding me?,"This is exactly why we now have TSA agents making everyone take their shoes off before boarding a plane.. honestly, why would you sell these?"
3,"Not Enough Capacity, Period.","I was somewhat suspect when the description did not disclose the fluid capacity in each sandal, but I went ahead and ordered anyway. I was extremely disappointed to find via my own experimentation that each sandal has a capacity of no more than 1.5 fl oz. Unless you're packing Everclear or Absinthe, you're not even going to get buzzed off of these.Nice novelty item, but besides that, hardly useful."
1,The Dram Leaks!,"I have bought two pairs of Drams for myself and one for a friend and they have all leaked the liquid, not from the screw caps. It is the most comfortable and cushioned Reef flip-flop yet, but ""the Dram is not worth a damm!"""
2,"leaks bad, missing seals! Twice!","Was so excited to get these..ordered a pair, fit great, but RIGHT foot leaked, because it was missing the seal, returned to get another with the other shoe leaking this time...also, cheap plastic, pain in the but to fill, and it barely holds one shot.....cool -but bad design"
2,Flask Cracks,"I thought these sandals were the sweetest thing when I first got them 2 months ago. However, in the past week the flask on both sandals cracked. They are very comfortable and if I were to buy another pair of reefs i would go for the original sandals or the fannings. Please beware when spending $50 on a pair of sandals with a flask."
2,Are You That Desperate?,"These sandals are basically well made sandals - nothing fancy, other than you can sneak alcohol into a concert in them. Unfortunately, each sandal only holds about 1.5 ounces of liquor, or a total of two weak drinks. If you are really desperate enough to need the buzz, let someone else drive and drag you along. If you really want the age-old secret, here it is - fill a small ""clean"" cooler with ice and vodka with your unopened orange juice inside. Nobody can tell."
1,bad buy,"I bought a set of these and they're a cool novelty, being the guy who has flask sandals. There's a couple problems though, one sandal leaked all 1 shot of booze out. The other sandal, even after many washings with dish soap, still make whatever alcohol I put in them taste nearly unbearable, even when poured into a mix. Not worth any amount of money spent on these, do not buy them."
5,This Is the new age album to have...really!!,"Most critics would agree that this is David Arkenstone at his very best. I have to agree also with collin mcdaniel that David has not made an album of this calibur since!! This of course was his debut album and so every song is beautifully and meticulously crafted and sounds rich with analog instrumentation.For any of you fans of David's current music, this will definitely be a change because like another reviewer said, it was before he started becoming so ethnically fixed on one style and every track is a five star with the exception of ""Rain"" which goes a little too long on the arpeggiation.This should be regarded by all audiophiles as one of the top five albums to own.J castle"
3,Put's me to sleep,"I hate reviewing this artist work as some like the CD's I find so spacy , it puts me to sleep. This one of those...I seldom make it thru...before I'm asleep."
3,Originally immersive,"3 1/2Compositionally competent enough to ignore the spawning of a thousand sub-par, new-aged, synthesized relaxation discs, Arkenstone's debut promises electric vibrancy for those willing to disassociate what his pioneering sound had been made into afterwards."
5,The first and still the best,This is by far David Arkenstone's best album. The music certainly isn't as complex as his later works but this one has a very unique style which he hasn't duplicated since. Definite must buy.
4,A great addition to your collection,This book has a nice variety of games and lessons suitable for young actors. It offers variations to games and lessons to dovetail with your own program. It has some fantastic insights for the teacher too and is an effective book to pull out when your program needs a little twinkle or to a beginning teacher who needs a basis on which to build his or her program.
5,Minh Le's Starred Review,"""The Bird of One Wing"" was a captivating story. It expressed the heartache story of one woman's life in great detail. It inspired me and taught me a lot about my culture that I didn`t already know. I recommend this book to people of all ages and am 100% certain that they will enjoy it! So, what are you waiting for... ORDER IT! and have fun!"
4,The 64 bit Motherboard,This motherboard works very well and very fast. I find that NOT EVERY software program runs with my Operating System or the 64-bit motherboard but most things like the internet and video games seem to accept it very well and Command and Conquer is running the smoothest that I have ever seen!
2,Not a complete work...,"I owned the version from 1987 and bought this thinking it would be an improvement. I only used the first one occasionally, but in my line of work as a Legal Nurse Consultant, I am constantly using a Medical Dictionary & Encyclopedia. Each time I reach for this book now, I know now that what I am looking for will have a good probability of not being in the book, or a poor description. For example, I was looking for the typical symptoms of hypocalcemia - the book tells you ""hypocalcemia - a diminished level of calcium in the blood"" - that's not very helpful.There are many other situations that have rendered my opinion of the usefulness of this book to be minimal if you need to rely on a medical dictionary/encyclopedia.This book was very dissapointing as I am trying to build my library. That is one reason for being able to see a book first, and have a few examples you want to look up in the book before buying."
5,excellent resource book,i am a nursing major and this book is EXCELLENT for reference... i recommend it highly...
4,Hot biscuits and sweet marie,"This is a hit or miss album for me. Some of their best next to some just ok songs. However it does have the awesome, overlooked ""Hot biscuits and sweet marie"". I would buy it just for that. Other than that, it's probably a three star album."
2,"Beautifully performed, however","this recording is NOT comparable to JRB's ""Songs For a New World."" The accompaniments are nowhere as interesting and the lyrics/storytelling, along with the endless melodies, are nothing short of cloying. As for the reviewer who mentioned that Mr. Bucchino is an up and coming B'way composer, it must be noted that he has now had but one show on B'way, A Catered Affair, and many of these tunes are recycled from many years past. A cabaret artist maybe, but this endless ballad style would never make it past the public at large"
5,The American Art Song Lives!,"Please don't be fooled into thinking that Mr. Bucchino writes only ""theater"" music. His songs are true art songs that can grace a recital stage. I have included ""Unexpressed"" in my recital repertoire. Not only is his music well written, but it is far from easy to perform and does indeed require the same attention to detail as any good art song. This album was a real surprise and a joy to hear some of my favorites performed by other artists - another perspective from which to draw. Just two words: BUY IT!"
2,Mr. Bucchino/ Not a craftsman,"Although there are a few moments where the sentiment works with the music, this is very poor craftsmanship, in my opinion. The lyrics are full of psycho-babble phrases, (therapist references and all) really wordy- and as any hack knows- if you place dense lyrics on complex musical phrases- you get ponderous overfull stuff.And this music is complex. Whereas the track THIS MOMENT is deceptively simple and works very well. But the rest of the CD..??"
3,Smells good at first...,"I bought this product because I was really taken by the unique fragrance. It was the smell of cake with something fruity in it. However, as I wear it, the frutiness of the scent fades and it seems to smell just like a regular french vanilla perfume.If you're a Britney fan then I recommend it. If you're not (like me) I recommend ""Provocative Interlude"" by Elizabeth Arden. It smells very similar, but has a more fruity/floral side to it which lasts all day. No difference in price, unfortunately."
5,Fantastic Movie,"I have always like this movie since I was a kid. And the best part is, is it is a great clean family movie."
4,Good I suppose,This movie is more than predictable but otherwise it is very sweet. The cast is great and the storyline is sweet. The little girl Alisan Porter is also adorable... okay enough cutesy language.
4,great,I love Curly Sue when I was younger as I'd forgotten half of the story line. It was a joy to watch again.
5,My DVD: Curly Sue,"The DVD was Delivered in good condition, the post master just shoved it in to my mail box and the envelope was riped, the DVD played good and my family loved this movie, So I have to give this a 100% and I would be glad to buy from this person or company again.Thanks from Roy Maricle"
2,Book content not as I expected.,"The experience with the seller was great! Product information was appropriate and valid. However, the content of the book was not what I expected based on other tatter's reviews."
2,A great singer deserves a far better biography,"It is a mystery how this apparently unedited mess made its way into the Baskerville series. Some of their other ""Great Singers"" bios are definitely worthwhile. I'm not talking about a split infinitive or two, but rather about such choppy syntax and punctuation that the reader has to do all the work to derive any meaning at all. Also, it conveys no real sense of the great Stevens. The 40-buck price in the jacket flap makes it all the more jaw dropping. The publisher should have at least hired a temp for a few hours to clean up the worst of it. I'm wondering if the sole criticism in Mr. Pennino's defense is a friend or relative. With luck, Stevens will someday receive the documentation her talent merits."
3,What a Disappointment,"I was overjoyed to see Truffaut's ""The Green Room"" finally released on DVD, even if it is via a disc-on-demand service. Bizarrely, MGM is committing profit suicide by releasing it under one of its obscure alternate Euro titles instead of the more familiar one under which most of us know it.The disappointments begin with the source, which is a PAL transfer with all the attendant problems that creates. Color is washed out, everybody's voice is pitched too high and the film only runs 90 minutes, not the 95 stated on the box. It's not letterboxed, either, as Amazon claimes; it's full screen.How about the quality of the transfer? Terrible! The disc freezes up at numerous spots and the picture breaks up frequently. Looking at the recorded side of the disc, it appears striped rather than displaying the smooth, consistent color of a healthy disc. Amazon needs to check their DVD recorders!I'm hanging on to my old VHS copy."
5,A Great About a Movie Stars Life? You Better Believe it!!!,"I would like to thank Marsha Daly for giving us this in depth book on the life of one of the worlds biggest stars. She truly captured Stallone in all his glory. The subtleties and and detail she went into make the diffrence, seperating this book from any other written about Stallone or any movie star. The subject certainly helps, but the writing could make a janitors life seem intresting. There is so much to be learned from the life of Stallone, and so much more to him than anyone knows, and this book certainly shows that. I couldn't possibly thank you enough for writing this book Marsha Daly"
4,moka brew coffee,"Bought this product after drinking great coffee in Amsterdam that was pressure brewed,[senseo one cup],and this machine is close but no cigar.The taste from this machine is better than drip machines but not as frothy as the Senseo.Senseo draw-back is buying your coffee in those pods,very expensive.This machine is low pressure,maybe the difference in taste."
2,nah don't buy it,Please do yourself another favour this year by not buying this textbook. The writter had a difficult time explain the meaning of money and frequency confuse what he was wrtiing in chappeters.
4,A Perfect Murder?,"I greatly enjoyed this book. The half-Caucasian, half-aborigine Detective Inspector Napolean Bonaparte (Bony to his friends) becomes involved in this case hoping he's found the perfect murder. A man named Marks visits Windee Station then vanishes. The local police assume he was lost in the bush but Bony has reason to think differently. This mystery is populated with a host of interesting outback characters, aborigines, blackmailers, secondary mysteries, and an awe-inspiring fire. The vision of 1930's Australia is exotic to us in this day and age, yet presented with complete understanding. It is worth noting that Bony and his contemporaries are well aware of his biracial status and some of the language used may bother some. The original copyright of this story is over 60 years ago though, and Mr. Upfield's heart and intentions are in the right place."
4,At these low prices a great accessory,"I didn't like the original suggested retail price and put this off purchasing more essential accessories for my Nikon 8400. Wa-La! The price drops 50% or more, cheap-o bucks and I did it. Actually, its only a battery pack, but when that special Litho battery dieds or no replacements are around, slap in a set of the ever common AA's or AA rechargeable batteries and I'm back in business. I also like the additional shutter release for vertical photos and the extra heft in weight it gives the camera. The battery access cover needs to be twisted off (very easy) to allow the CP10 to slip into the 8400, but they have a storage spot for the cover so it never can be lost or left somewhere. All said in done, I'm glad I have mine. Again, especially at these prices."
2,"Great concept, but...","I am a new owner of a Nikon 8400 camera (a great item, by the way). I like the MB-CP10 Battery Pack for taking vertical photos. It adds body and convenience to the camera. However, I was disappointed to find out that it is not a supplemental battery. The user must either use the camera battery OR the CP-10. So, if you are using this item for taking vertical pictures...understand that you will only be using the ""AA"" batteries, which burn up pretty fast."
4,"Wiccan imagry, but not unfamiliar to anyone...","the Tarot of the Old Path is certainly pagan in tone. the illustrations are subtle, incorporating traditional tarot symbols (like the two pillars in the high priestess card)without being any less origional. i found that the cards had enough similarity to standard rider-waite decks to be familiar, but were much more attuned to Wiccan philosophy than to ceremonial magick. I would recomend this deck to Wiccans and Pagans primarily, but also to anyone who collects or likes a variety of artwork."
2,The book is not necessary.,"The Tarot of the Old Path deck is beautiful and quite original, but all you need to interpret it is the instruction booklet included with the deck. The book doesn't add much except the meanings of the flowers pictured on the cards--which is less interesting than you'd think."
1,You ripped me off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am very unhappy with this entire service. I lost my christmas money by giving it to you and not recieving anything. It has been more than a month since I ordered this game and I have not recieved it or my money back. I hate you people and your ability to prey on the innocent. I hope you go out of business.
5,The best racing game that doesn't have a nude for a mascot!,"Don't listen to the cons up there, this game has great graphics, long levels, tons of secrets, and great background music. And if you don't want to race, you can play the totally exellent stunt level!"
4,Nothing Went Wrong,"Well, I ordered this item for someone else to get before Christmas. It arrived in excellent time in the condition described. It wasn't brand spanking new, but it was good. It worked better than the one I owned, which required several tries in my N64 to work. The packaged arrived in 3 days, when I believe it said a minimum of 4 or so, so I was pretty happy and surprised when it did get here. Trusted, definitely."
5,Cool Fast and Fun What more could you want?,"Rush two is a great improvment on the first rush. With the ability to adjust each of the 12+ cars color,handling,engine sound,and mags this game has it all. It also has a great sound track to go along with it's well designed tracks. Two player action is great and the stunt course provides hours of fun. Of all the racing games for the 64 this has to be one of the better ones money well spent!"
4,Good heavy-weight steel,"This works well for us, the arms that hold the board up are of fairly heavy-weight steel so they seem reliable. We just switched from a T-leg to a 4-legged board and it works a little better with the T-leg than the 4-leg (the type pictured), but is satisfactory for either. Remember that most irons must be empty of water before you can store them flat (or they'll leak)."
1,Looks are deceiving,"I purchased this Ironing Board Hanger cause I have a 'Y' shaped board like the one in the picture. When you hand the board on it, the hanger twists a little thus not hanging flat against the closet door. Also, the whole contraption hangs too high up so the door won't even close when the actual iron is on it."
4,Does the Job!,"I bought this in white to match my linen closet door and it does the job it's supposed to. I was a little disappointed in how flimsy it was once I put it together, but once I hung it on the door and put the iron and board on it, it was clear that it wouldn't be falling apart anytime soon.The assembly was incredibly easy and only took a matter of minutes and it looks good over the door and allows the door to close completely. I have a T-leg ironing board and it's not a problem for this to hold it in place.Overall, it does the job, but it seems like the price should be lower, considering the product itself isn't that high quality to begin with."
1,poorly made,I just purchased this product and when I tried to place my 4 leg iron on it it slipped right through. I have a fairly standard board from macy's so I dont think it was because of that. It was very flimsy to begin with anyway. The pieces fit together loosely and it had dirt on it when i took it out of the plastic wrapper which should have been the first clue. If you have anything other than a T bar iron board this product is not for you
1,Not good for V shape ironing boards,This product is no good for V shaped ironing board legs. When you move the door it's hanging from the board falls down. Material is also very flimsy.
2,"Not exactly what I wanted, but service was great","The application I was looking for to - hang my iron up - this holder did not work for me. I was unable to put the iron upright and when I put it flat the water would all come out - not good. So, I chose another model."
4,"Works very well. But, I can't say it's better than other brands.","There is not much you can say about rubbing compound. But, this one works very well. Hot Tip: Use a damp, cloth towel to apply it. If you use a dry towel, the rubbing compound will dry up quickly and stick to the towel. Use a damp (very damp) piece of cloth towel to apply this stuff. An old wash cloth or hand towel works great. Rub it on the car with a circular motion. When the applicator towel becomes grimey, wash it with soap and warm water then continue. Or, use a fresh piece of damp towel. You can rub out small scuffs and scratches with this stuff. Allow the products to dry to a haze then use a soft, clean, dry towel to wipe it off. It comes off very easily. Then apply wax or sealer."
4,Solid book,"I bought this for my son, a rising senior in high school. I was surprised that he immediately picked it up and read it, and said it was very helpful to him. However, I was also surprised that it included some essays that were very short, but conveyed a unique thought process. I would be scared to death for my son to send a couple of paragraphs and have that be his one shot at promoting himself.Admissions counselors would probably like this book, mainly because it would promote more variety for them, as they have to wade through hundreds of writings."
3,Good for basic Introduction but lacks depth and references.,"I have not read the dummies series, that was my first and maybe last book of the series.Just lack of depth is implied by the title. Otherwise for basic Indroduction the book wasgood."
5,Fabulous!,"I bought this book for me & several friends, we just love the book! I recommend it to anyone who has trouble remembering all of the astrology information, this is a great item of reference!"
3,Not a serious introduction.,"If your curiosity on the matter is light and superficial, this book will do just fine. You'll find general and easy to understand explinations for a variety of topics in astrology along with an astrological ""cookbook"" for a quick chart analysis. The book comes short on the topic of sign compatibility rendering it too simplistically for any real use, though.I also feel that the book is too trivial at times, harming astrology's already battered image; but this is more a personal opinion than a fact.If your interest runs a bit deeper and/or are looking for a professional introduction, there are more serious and in-depth books out there."
3,"Fast Car, but not for all surfaces.","Nice, fast car. Nicely detailed. But it spins out on too many surfaces. We have hardwoods floors, and the wheels cannot grip enough to let the car really go. Instead, it spins in circles. Now, I tried this on a sheet of drywall (we live in a veritable contruction zone), and it drove better there. I imagine it works well on the track that you can buy for it. But keep in mind that it doesn't neccesarily perform as well on all floors, even hardwood."
5,Sit back and close your eyes,"What can I say, Hed Kandi have done it again ! I got home from work, poured myself a whiskey, put Serve Chilled into my player and pressed play. I woke up the next morning in the same couch I had been relaxing in the night before!Disc 1 has to be my favourite, with tracks that smack of Cafe Del Mar and Mono. CD 2 is even more chilled and of course my all time favourite Morcheeba kicks the CD off with a good swing.A must for all Hed Kandi Fans !"
5,Best entertaining book ever published!,"I adore this book! The history, the inside information, the recipes, the atmosphere sure makes me wish I had been alive to see the 1960s. There is a pasta recipe that is so very good, you must try it! Wonderful publication, thanks Ms. Baldridge for sharing your memories!"
5,Jackie Kennedy's style,"This book has wonderful stories, told by Letitia Baldridge, about the Kennedys' early years as a couple and then their first years in the White House. It's told from the perspective of Jackie Kennedy's style in entertaining, but of course it includes nuggets about the Kennedys as real people. I love the photos and the menus and recipes from the head chef during their White House years. The stories are just great."
5,TRULY MAGIC....from author of EXPLOSION IN PARIS...,"Just the cover alone is worth buying this stunning, captivating book! The photos capture the timeless elegance, style and taste, not only in Jackie's clothes but her entertaining, choice of menu and recipes, personal notes...Camelot, undoubtedly! TRULY MAGIC, the book AND the Kennedy administration! I think I own just about every book written about the Kennedys. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!! I've bought this as gifts also."
5,one of my most favorite jazz albums of all time,"When I used to make tapes for friends that didn't know or like jazz music and I wanted to introduce them to jazz, I started the tape with the intro and the first cut on this album. Need I say more? It's a wonderful album with original versions beautifully interwoven with the band's playing of the same tune. I just love the ""movie"" concept of the album. It starts as a movie and finishes as a movie. If you want someone to get to like jazz, buy this album for them."
5,A Happy Discovery,Never judge an artist by sampling one work! Listening to one disc soured me on Haden - hearing the like of the albums from Quartet West changed my mind in a hurry -- great music and wonderful service!
4,"Demons, Fortune Tellers, Religion, Oh my!","This movie is one of the best horror films. The plot is original, the actors believable, the sets very visual... even the soundtracks pretty good! The special effects are fair. The plot involves an attractive womans quest to destroy cheating men in general and in particular, a young man who hopes to become a minister. Alas, he is the last of his line. Whats her deal? Buy it and see! Several known performers in this film: Melba Moore, Hardison, TWO Jacksons (one famous Samuel, oh and Freddie) The climax of the film is intense, the ending is excellent. Bored with other horror films because they're all clones? Buy this one then.... it's a standout!"
5,the must underrated vampire movie of the 90's!,"Very interesting and underrated vampire blaxplotation thriller from writer-director-producer-star James Bond III. What works in this movie is a good storyline with some sex and violence around, the movie was released by the popular independent studio known as ""Troma"" in theaters and has gained a small cult following. The acting is very good. The dialogue is good. And there's also some great cinematography."
4,So Horrible It's Funny!,"First off, Make no mistake this is a troma movie (need I say more)! This movie is so terrible some of the scenes in the film made tears come to my eyes from laughing so hard! The only reason I give this film 4 stars instead of 1 is because of how horribly funny the movie is."
5,A very good and scary black horror film since Blacula.,"I also liked Vampire In Brooklyn, but if I was to choose between Vampire In Brooklyn and Def by Temptation, I would have to say that I liked Def by Temptation better."
5,very good,"i thought the movie was great i thought cythia bonds did her thing, i wish she could have been in more things beacause she did her part very well in that movie i think she played in one other thing after def by temptation and that was the heat of the night after that she was never seen again."
4,"Good movie, Not for kiddies.","A young religious scholar takes time out to visit a friend. While he is in town, he meets a very seductive woman with one thrill -- to secure a soul."
2,=/,"It warms like it says it will but between applying it and such, the warmth caused it to not be as slick as I needed it to be."
2,Didn't like the paper quality and presentation,"I bought them (Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."
1,Boring,"As an Austen fan I was disappointed. To a non Austen fan this book is akin to watching paint dry while listening to a 4 hour lecture on the intricacies of interpretive dance, followed by a cyborg reading the phone book."
1,persuasion,this is terrible. you cannot read it because the lines are all misaligned. a complete waste of money.
5,Favorite Book of All Time,"When people think of Jane Austen they think of her major works such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Emma"" but I think that ""Persuasion"" is one of her best books that is often overlooked. It is a beautifully written story, and every Jane Austen fan should read it. One of my all time favorite books."
4,Stick with it,"After getting through a long period of rather dull set up, this book rewards you with a funny, romantic, light hearted diversion that is well worth reading."
2,Antiquated,The wording was a bit too antique for my liking. The storyline was good but I was disappointed in this book.
2,Persuasion,I couldn't get into this book. I kept trying but decided to just close it out.I would not recommend this book.
2,Austen forgot that a book should have a PLOT,"eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Undervalued by her arrogant baronet father and prideful sisters, meek Anne Elliott's main goal when she sees her jilted ex-fiance is to hide her regret.Not as involving as some of her other tales, with fewer likable characters and a very draggy storyline. I gave up halfway through."
4,My first foray into Austen.,"This was my first foray into Jane Austen. I must admit it took a while for me get accustomed to the literary style, but once I got into the flow of it, I quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to reading more of her classic works!"
4,a beauty...a wonderful read,"I bought this for my kindle..50 cents! Goodness I am almost ashamed. Sick with a cold, I read it almost straight through. Don't know how I missed this before. It is a joy. So much better than much of what is put out today."
4,Definitley worth a read,Another classic that is definitely worth a read. Its one of those books that is slow in a couple of places but the suspense of the ending - or the expected ending keeps you reading. Oh you just want to go back in time and find your own Captain Wentworth!!
1,Tough read,"I could not get interested in this book, or past the style of writing. Jane Austen is just not my cup of tea."
3,book,If you are not ready to wrap you mind around some old time literature don't pick this up. Hard read
5,my favorite work of Austen's,"I was surprised by this one. Persuasion was the only work of Jane Austen's that I had not read in high school. I don't know why it took me until 32 years of age to decide to read it, but I finally did, and loved it so much! It is immediately familiar in the sense that you can sense it as a work of Austen's, but has some slight differences. Anne is less spunky & for some a less immediate heroine. There is certainly less dialogue between characters as compared to Austen's other works. I feel that these things represent maturity & sophistication in her writing that add much depth. I can now say that this is my favorite. I was instantly moved to tears at the crucial point of the story I was so touched and affected by Anne's journey of persuasion....I hope you are too."
4,Persuasion,"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."
3,Persuasion Curiosity,"I had been very Curiousabout is book after seeing it in the Movie ""The Lake House"". I wanted to know what interested the character in the movie so much abou te book. A I begain to read it... At first it was intriging but the further I got into it it seemed to drag on. It is not te type of bok I normally read and I have yet to complete it. The Last book I read before this I purchased in paper back and begn to read ater Supper (7pm) I read and completed the book at 1 amCould not put it down. Pursuasion however I can Put down and unlss im bored woul not pick it up to read. not thatit was a borin book I understand the concept it is just dry."
5,Awesome book,"This book truly is amazing. I really enjoyed reading it. I had to do it for a class, but there came a point when I couldn't put it down. I carried it around with me on my phone and every time I had a spare minute I would read it."
2,Shoddy quality,"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."
3,Not nearly as good as Pride & Prejudice,"Overall, Persuasion was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more with some plot adjustments.I felt like I was never well acquainted with the object of Anne Elliot's affection, Captain Wentworth. Although Austen described why Wentworth was such a good man, I did not participate much in Anne's love for him (although I did empathize with her feelings). There were great moments and good characters, but there could have been so much more in the relationship between Anne and Frederick Wentworth.Also, I was disappointed that the the end was summarized in narration. The climax of the story pertaining to the romance and to the foes of the family, though starting out well, ended too soon in narration rather than dramatic action."
3,A fun classic novel,"I rate this book three stars. This is the first book from Jane Austen I have read and am not accustomed to her style of writing. I liked this book very much, don't get me wrong, but at times it dragged on, going over tons of social class and position stuff. The end is expected, but suprising at the same time. There is romance in the book, but not enough for my satisfaction. But overall this books is a good one! I would definetly buy it regardless of my personal tastes."
3,Not Austen's Best,"If (like me) you value Austen primarily for her wit, you may pass on Persuasion.Persuasion is a bit tedious. It's all mincing and moralizing, with none of the wit and good humor that make Pride and Prejudice worthwhile. Persuasion's protagonist, the wilting Anne Elliot, is a doormat for her self-involved relations, whom she not only tolerates but also excuses. Anne's blushing weakness may add to the melodrama (maybe the romance), but it also sucks all the satire out of the narrative. As a result, the reader is deprived of a richly deserved laugh at the pompous antagonists' expense. And without a good laugh, the story is hardly worth the trouble."
5,favorite novel,This is my favorite Austen work. it's a bit more mature than her other works. Love lost and regained. This also shows how a young woman can mature into a self-confident and very responsible young woman in the face of a daunting and selfish family. Mrs. Smith who is Miss anne Eliot's close friend and the description of her character in the book is much more enjoyable than any of the movie versions can portray.
5,Closest to my heart,This is the closest to my heart because it was the first Jane Austen movie I ever saw and the first of her books I have read. I found Anne to be such a kindhearted soul and her transformation from the beginning of the book to the end made my heart leap with joy for her and Captain Wentworth.
4,Nice Book,You get a nice book for the price. The footnotes help with understanding for younger readers and those not familiar with the English time frame in which Austen wrote.
1,Did not enjoy Persuasion on first read but may re-read,"I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an 18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, and I feel it would be a crime not to read the original first.If I enjoy Pride and Prejudice I might just return to reading Persuasion again, just to see if I find it a much better read."
1,Size of Print,"The print in this book is very small and I find that my eyes begin to hurt after awhile. It definitely, for me, interferes with the pleasure of reading the book."
3,Persuasive?,"Persuasion for me was very interesting. It was not necessarily my favourite Jane Austen book(mine is Emma)it is very good. I like the relationship between Anne and Wentworth. It is evident he still harbours feelings for her even after she broke his heart, I loved how they both admitted their love for one another and finally came to terms with their feelings. If you are a Jane fan then read it but it probably will not be your alltime favourite."
4,Another one from the master,"I first read Jane Austen as a freshman in college, reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in one fabulous day, a singular feat for me. I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and straighforward. This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at first with a myriad of relatives and relationships. But at its core it is a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her. It is not merely a good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of those, and a lovely read."
4,"Difficult at first, but well worth it","Persuasion, like other Jane Austen novels, contains characters who are class conscious to the point of being absolutely ridiculous. Anne is the most sensible one of the bunch. She decided that these class distinctions are less important than helping an old friend. Sir Walter Elliot and his oldest daughter, Elizabeth, are completely willing to associate with those of a higher class than themselves but will avoid people of a lower class. They avoid anything that would ruin their image. Mary, the other Elliot daughter, is just as selfish but in a slightly different way. Jane Austen's dialogue is difficult to follow at times, but worth the extra work it takes to understand the story."
4,"A good, quick book","This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece. I actually found it quite quick. My only gripe is that this story (compared to ""Mansfield Park"" or ""Pride and Prejudice"") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope. I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters. It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete."
3,"Great book, but this copy is so tiny.","I love this book, but this copy is not even 4 x 6 inches. The print is very small. I would buy a bigger copy if I had the chance again."
4,Not up to par with Austen's other works,"Although Persuasion was an amazing book, it just did not add up to Jane Austen's other works. While not as silly as EMMA, it did not have the character development or interesting story line(s) of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Still, a good read, if you're an Austen or romance novel fan."
4,"Love the interesting, detailed characters","My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror! Other than that, it was refreshing and fun to read a Jane Austen novel that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago."
5,Persuasion,"Jane Austin has been one of the best reads I have had the pleasure of reading, was easy to put myself into the time and place of this wonderful book"
4,My favorite Jane Ausren novel so far,"Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels. This is the most suspenseful of her books that I have read thus far, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,Just don't like Austen!,"This is the third book by Austen I forced my way through, but I must admit, I find her writing dry, humorless, dull, and always the same themes. It's the constant talk about class, and who is good enough for whom, and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess, I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street, so far, is superb. One really understands Michael Fane and his little sister!"
1,How does Chinese water torture sound?,"Chinese water torture? Sounds like a welcome diversion from this boring redundant work of ""art"" to me. I feel for the trees that were wasted in the process of creating this horrendously boring soap opera in paperback. It is possible that I missed something while reading this work because I spent most of the time trying to stay awake. However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime ""soap"". In conclusion, not only do I NOT recommend this novel, but I pledge to do my best to begin an anti-Persuasion League, to prevent the widespread development of narcolepsy in high school students who are forced to read worthlessly painful novels."
1,the book Persuasian,As it is written in old English it is very hard to understand what she is talking about!Imogene Blue
2,Weird line breaks,"I downloaded the sample chapter to read with the Kindle App for iPod Touch, and the line breaks were all weird. Maybe not a problem on a real Kindle? I haven't had this problem with other books."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"I almost feel ashamed that I did not like this book, after all it is Jane Austin! I loved Pride and Predujice, I loved Emma but I found Persuasion tedious. The characters were not interesting, the story rather disjointed and lackluster. I made myself finish it thinking perhaps it would get better, for me at least it did not."
2,Not the best,"Like all Jane Austin novels, this was very class conscious, overly verbose, and difficult to relate to for a modern audience. It lacked the charm of some of her other books and the story dragged excessively. A long and wordy read, I would recommend reading ""Sense & Sensibility"" instead."
4,Refreshing!,"In Jane Austen's last novel, Persuasion, we meet the Elliot family: Sir Walter and his daughters, Elizabeth, Mary and the youngest daughter Anne. Over 8 years ago Anne became engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a man with no one to recommend him. After much persuasion from a family friend, Lady Russell, Anne breaks off the engagement. When the reader meets Anne it is more than 8 years later and circumstances have brought her and the now Captain Frederick Wentworth back into each other's lives. Will they be able to rekindle their relationship or did Anne's initial refusal ruin all hope for them to be together...?Reading Jane Austen is truly refreshing! The subtleness with which Austen delves into the relationship between Anne and Captain Wentworth among other characters is beautifully done. A great read!"
4,Love it,One of my favorite books of all times. This story never grows old. Love every bit of and never grow tired of reading it over again. Wonderful.
5,A Classic,I chose this version because it was free and I'm a big fan of Jane Austen. It's nice to have her collection available to read when the time becomes available and it's difficult to beat the price.
3,Good Read,"Starts out very slow and too much background detail, but once the characters are established it is a good read. Typical Jane Austen style"
2,not my favorite austen,"i think this is the worst of the austen novels for me,alot of people choose this novel. as their favorite, my favorite,1-emma,2-mansfield park,3-northanger abbey 4-sense amd sensibilty, 5-pride and predjudice 6-perssuation ,. i think this novel is dry,and not alot happens.although i am still an austen fan, this one is my least favorite.so i recommend, if you have never read an austen novel, please do not start with this one, i would start with her best known novels , sense and sensibilty or pride and predjudice and save persuaition for last. also keep in mind her novels are about middle-class or upper middle class girls looking for marriage."
5,Classic,extra period piece. Jane Austin at her best. I'm a Jane fan. /Excellent look at the interworking of Edwardian England.
5,Great book,Great authoress of all times. Enjoyable story very well narrated. Characters excellently described. The book vividly takes you back to another era!
1,"The tape, I'm afraid, is very bad indeed.","I bought the tape with delight, but found that I can not listen to it. Whatever producers do to reduce the hissing of the 's' sounds, these producers did *not* do.Just the first few minutes of the first side were extremely distracting and irritating. I couldn't imagine the actress - whose voice is really lovely! - talking about the 'ssea' and Lyme Regissssss by the second half of the book.I am sorry to have to say it, but there it is."
2,A boring and snobby book.,"I don't know what all of you are talking about. I found this book to be boring, bourgeois and completely unsympathetic. I can not imgaine anyone relating to any of these characters, unless you are extremely rich and live in 19th century England.It was, however, well written."
2,"Tiresome, simplistic romance","Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award. Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19. Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums."
2,Persuasion by Jane Austen,I found the book to be a slow read primarily because the use of the English language is so different.
2,Such a huge disappointment.,"When I saw Masterpiece Theater was doing a series on Jane Austen and her novels, I decided to read them in the order the shows would air--starting with Persuasion. It was the first and last of Austen's that I will read. She may well have captured the mores and social rules of the time, but she didn't create characters I could really care about. I stuck with it to the end and found the revelations about Mr. Elliot to come out of nowhere and the ending romance to be something we could see coming from the very start. I'll take Edith Wharton over Austen any day."
1,Not Austen's best,"I am a fan of Jane Austen's work, but this is definitely not her best novel. It was written later in her life and lacks the emotion and plot that are so captivating in her earlier works. Read 'Pride and Prejudice' instead."
2,not one of her better works,"after reading P&P and Northanger, i just couldn't slog my way through another of her books. but this one looked more interesting than any of her other works, so i thought, ""why not, i'll give it a try."" big mistake. by far her worst (that i've read, but i still have emma and s&s to go, and no plans on ever reading mansfield park). but i think it is safe to say i am not a fan of austen's. she's dull, and she turned an interesting idea into a dull book. i only gave her two stars instead of one because the premise behind the book was such a good one."
4,great bio,"Middlebrook wrote a pretty good biography of one of our more important poets, though I'll say that Sexton is an example of the artist being more interesting than the art. What makes this biography so exceptional is the access Middlebrook had--she had access to Sexton's psychiatric tapes. Middlebrook can really give a full account of Sexton's life and psyche. And believe me, that woman was really screwed up."
4,"""distinction between creativity and self-destruction""","This is an extraordinary individual who lived through her language that spoke of her creativity and powerful forces of mental agony. Surely her sufferings and dysfunctions created poetic dilemma that opened eyes to not only individual/relational pathologies, but also the social/cultural/intellectual binds of the women of her time. I am deeply touched by her life, passion and her unpretentiousness, and at the same time, feel great empathy for her family, particularly her daughters, for the price they paid for such complex environments."
2,Is Making Someone Look Like a Mess a Feminist Statement?,"Obviously I do not think so. Sexton was I think more aware of the impact she was making and what ""turf"" was available to women writers in the Fifties. Same as today -- the body. Writing about her own body she could reach for universality. But Middlebrook is not willing to really examine her poems except to analyze their ""clang"" or rhyme scheme, and after awhile comes off as kind of dull-witted; eternally pointing out that Sexton can rhyme. The meaty stuff of why Sexton became a celebrity, commanded high speaker fees (for her time) on such small book sales Middlebrook doesn't go into. I would rather read the biography by Sexton's daughter Linda if I can find it. I think Linda also forgave her mother for being sexual, later; but I may be wrong."
2,Psychiatrist overstepped; did it help?,"Patient records are privileged; Dr. Orne justifies releasing tapes of Anne Sexton's therapy because the daughter of A.S. approved. He wrote the preface to the book, displaying a rather passive attitude to the malfeasance of the therapist who slept with A.S. And does the end--understanding creativity/a poet's life and death--justify the means? Do outpourings in therapy tell readers about where creativity comes from, how it is shaped, the interplay of life and art? I doubt it. People ""edit"" their therapy talk, too, though differently from their public utterings. Readers may be seduced by these secrets, hoping to find answers that cannot be given, even--maybe especially--by therapists. I think the biographer overplays her hand, and might have done a better book without the controversial tapes."
2,"Probably wouldn't buy again, but it worked.","It was a chore getting this grass to stay down in the tank, but finally managed to use a few sprigs of it. If you purchase it, leave it is large of a section as you can, put it down first, then dump your rocks/sand on top of it and pull it up to height. Also, the sprigs were not as ""soft"" as I was hoping. No motion underwater."
2,Looks nice but...,Had high hopes for this product but it looks and actually feels rather sharp to the touch. So much so that I removed it from the tank becuase I was afraid my Clown Loach and Cory's would hurt themselves on it. Would probably look good in a tant without a lot of bottom feeders.
4,Vintage Dave,"Closer begins with a lively tune with an unfortunate title; that, however, does not detract from the catchy beat and melody. This number is one that will cause one to hit the repeat button. As for the remainder of the CD, it hums along nicely, following a pattern of predictable, yet enjoyable Sanborn. Track nine is another one that gets under you. I would definitely recommend this as an introduction to David Sanborn or for the loyal fan."
3,It's Alright...,"Well, the only main problem is that instead of the classic ""turning a wand into flower"" trick, you have to use a little pot. I thought this took away some of the pizazz, so I improvised. It is durable and doesn't break though. Overall, it was alright."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I had to send this back as soon as I opened it. It comes in a bag, not a box. The cup that the flower ""APPEARS"" from, is so flimsy that it was crushed by another box it was shipped with. It would have never lasted with a child handling it for long."
4,It's a fun little magic trick.,"I mainly purchased this item for the magic wand. (My 5 year old had been wanting one for some time now.) I came across this item and figured, hey it has a wand AND a magic trick! And it was prime, so the whole deal including shipping cost me about 6 bucks. And it was worth it. My son loves the magic wand and we both have a fun time doing the magic trick. It's really pretty adorable."
1,Doesn't work!,"Maybe we just got a bad one, but it doesn't work. The flower barely fits inside the wand (too wide) and gets stuck, and the magnet isn't powerful enough to pull it back out. My son was pretty disappointed with it, luckily it was just a stocking gift!"
1,Where's the flower?,"What the heck is that? The package finally arrived, but the flower was missing.. end of storyI got 2 peaces of plastic and a piece of metal for 10 bucks (shipping incl).. could be worse..But, seriously?!?.."
4,Good item for young children,My son loved this and needed hand/eye coordination items. This is a great product but the paint did start chipping after a couple of months.
4,CD player case,I needed a new CD player case and found this one at a great price. I listen to books on CD so I like this design. I wish that it had a waist strap instead of a shoulder strap but these CD cases are very difficult to find.
3,Utility depends on need,"This book reflects the research interests of the author, who is a genius, and should not be considered introductory, even at the graduate level. I do not find this book useful for learning anything for the first time. However, it provides an interesting perspective on many classic topics in many-body theory. Unlike the previous reviewer, I found the grandious statements a wonderful feature since most textbooks lack any of the author's voice. Reading this book is closer to attending a lecture than any text of it's kind I've read. I get this book from the library and I wouldn't pay $100 for it especially since the author posts his lectures notes on his website and much of the later material can be obtained from PROLA."
3,"Good choice of material, but quite sloppy","The book contains very interesting choice of material, but the derivations are quite sloppy, the notation frequently changes without warning, and there is huge amount of typos. This is a kind of book that gives you some good insights (aka Feynmann's books), but certainly not the book from which you can seriously learn the subject."
1,"Nice idea - poor quality device, firmware problems","After endless hours with Lingo and Dlink support I give up. There are firmware issues with this device, and Dlink and lingo point fingers at each other.Low volume, dropped calls, and frequent need to reboot the device.If you want lingo, don't use this device, get the standard box they provide."
2,Lingo Poor Service,I bought this device to try Lingo service but was very disappointed by the poor quality of Lingo service. Some features do not work at all and voice quality is not that great. I cancelled it because I was not very happy with this service and decided to continue using Vonage service.
4,Good product but ....,"The product is good. It worked without any hassle. However the Lingo service is not up to the mark. Because service matters ( little more than router) to the people who are reading this review I am writing about that below.The issues1. They say 30-day risk free trial(the trap): But start counting 30 days since the day you order. So while the device is shipped, you start loosing the days.2. Website badly designed: Many a times website does not work. I couldn't authorize phone number porting over website. I had to fax the document. That delayed the process and ate up my trial period.3. Customer service made out of parrots: The customer service people, instead of answering the questions you ask give scripted answers for similar questions. And keep on repeating until you get tired.4. Clogs broadband: It invariably slowed down the Internet connection.5. Cheaper VOIPs are available around."
2,Waste of time,I thought the time I spent on reading this book was wasted as there are several other books out there that explains the new age concepts much better.
2,not very good,"Fantastic books on Christian prayer and fasting are those by Bill Bright, Mahesh Chavda, and Kingsley Fletcher.I've read each at least 5 times, and done a great deal of wonderful fasting myself.This book by Lindsay is nowhere close to the above 3 books."
5,Complete Conan!,"These films are awesome! Lots of fighting, and gore, and mysticsm.I really love the first film! Sure, it is not canon R.E.Howard, but the action is still there! Arnold looks cool using swords and axes! Oh, the Pit part of the story is crap, but the rest is pretty cool.The second film has a lot of Arnold's humor in it, and a really Big Monster! It also has some very cool fight scenes and music, especially when Conan fights the Royal Guard, very cool!Two movies in one package. This is a must have for any Fantasy fan!"
2,Barbaric and Destroyed,"I have been a long time fan of these movies but this DVD release leaves much to be desired. The picture quality was OK, but the mono sound tracks come off as depressingly flat. The music in these movies originally was stirring and should have been again today.The scenes added to ""Barbarian"" are out of place and undercut a main theme of the movie. Those scenes were cut for good reason; I liked it much better before it was ""improved"".Stick with your old VHS if you have to."
4,Good value,4 stars for value. Both Conan movies for $10. What else is there to say.Don't expect to find Red Sonja here. That's not a Conan movie.... technically.
3,I HATE double sided disks!!!,"I like these movies (and unlike most, actually like the Destroyer better), but was very disappointed in the packaging. I just hate double sided disks, for one. Would it have been too much effort to put each movie on its own disk?I also was not pleased with the letterbox version of the Destroyer either.Movies are great, though, if you like the sword and sorcery thing."
1,Discs are defective! Do not buy.,Warning! Do not buy this product. The discs are DEFECTIVE. Towards the end of the first movie - Conan the Destroyer - there is serious digital artifacting that ruins both the video and the sound and sometimes even stops the disc entirely. This has been the case with all three copies that I have purchased.
3,Commentary is a Must!,"If you just bought The Complete Quest, be sure to watch both films with audio commentary. I don't know how it is possible to watch both of these movies with no commentary. Plus, Arnold is so hilarious, you won't even believe it. I felt that ""Barbarian"" was so slow it just did not grasp my attention through out the film. With the audio, you will most surely appreciate different aspects of the film. I do commend the great photography and editing. But i assure you that you will most definitely enjoy the commentary. ""Skull! Dead People""! -Arnold"
1,Booklet Missing,"In response to the last reviewer, I did not get anything in the lefthand sleeve either. I bought this set and there was no booklet in the lefthand side, though there was a sleeve for it. I brought it back for another one, and the replacement had no booklet either. Did the company producing this DVD change their minds about putting something in the sleeve, or did I get two bum copies in a row? The one star rating is because of the negligent packaging...the movies were fine."
4,Still cool after all these years,"The acting, dialogue and story is very simple, yet it is so good. I would say this movie is way better than twilight + eat pray love combined (and I watch all genre). I hope they figure out a way to transfer it to bluray."
5,The 2 Conan Movies,"A low price and you get both the movies. If one must indulge in western society's filth then let it be this old Arnold movie. Great Lines in Part one Part two is awful but still great.Beggar: A pittance to protect you from evil.Subotai: I am evil!Mongol General: Hao! Dai ye! We won again! This is good, but what is best in life?Mongol: The open steppe, fleet horse, falcons at your wrist, and the wind in your hair.Mongol General: Wrong! Conan! What is best in life?Conan: To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.Mongol General: That is good! That is good.The guy who played Subotai was great I think he was a surfer friend of the director.James Earl Jones is the best villain in history.See Conan do battle with the cult of Thulsa Doom.Then read the books which are far better. SeeThe Complete Chronicles of ConanGovernor make a King Conan movie asap!"
3,Does it come with a booklet?,"I have liked the movies since they came out, but I agree that the dvds could have been remastered with better sound and widescreening. I guess these will do for now given the decent bundled pricing. One quick question. Did anyone receive a booklet in the left sleeve of this set? There's an empty pocket in mine and it seemed weird. Is it just packaging or should I bother to return for a replacement? Thanks for any help from the Conan experts!"
4,Conan The Complete Quest.,"I was really chuffed to see both Conan Movies for a low price on DVD, the picture quality is great but the sound mmmmhhhhh not to good but who's complaining for this price. The only downside was that the manufacturers made a flap for the some sort of booklet but I did not recieve anything atall is this a Scam or is it a genuine mistake? if anyone knows I would be happy to know. All in all a great buy for this price and neat packaging, both movies on a double layered 1 disc."
2,Quite a pointless set.,"The ""Barbarian"" DVD is just the same as the previous, widely available (at least in R2/R4) Special Edition. This one just repeats it.The ""Destroyer"" disc in this set is even worse - just the film. Meanwhile, I'm watching my R4 DVD of ""Conan the Destroyer"", with two commentaries, two documentaries, storyboards, galleries and extra information about Howard's most famous creation.Avoid this R1 set."
4,Secrets of plant life,"I am a professional botanist in Finland and have started to translate King's book into Finnish. I decided to do that because King finally teaches me so many things I should have learned & understood in the basic botany and ecology courses I took ca. 20 years ago.All in all, this is a wonderful book and I would have credited it full five stars if it wasn't for this one weakness. There is not a single picture in the book. Some pictures would indeed have been most desirable, especially from laymens' point of view, for example in connection with the descriptions of anatomical details of leaves. Therefore the readers of the Finnish translation will be privileged in enjoying King's fine and clear text supported with pictures - provided the original publisher agrees to this."
5,What a feast!,"I bought this book for my little girl when she was just over one, purely for the beautiful illustrations. Well - she ooooohed and aaaaahed in mock horror at the bad animals stealing Handa's fruit and at the end rolled around laughing. It's now daily reading material and never fails to delight her. It has introduced her to different animals and fruits so well and it's so lovely to have a children's picture book set in a culture other than English/American. And the illustrations are without doubt the best of any I've seen. Definite for any child's library"
1,Never Received,"My son is a Breaking Benjamin fan and I ordered this direct from the photographer in October of 2006. He took my PayPal payment, but six months later I still haven't received it. I haven't received a refund of my $19.95, nor a recent email explaining the delay.The book may be very good, but they don't seem to care about potential readers."
5,Friday Night Lights + Exlosions in the Sky = Beautiful Chaos,"I've been listening to Explosions in the Sky for quite some time now--ever since the beginning of this year.. and this was before i watched Friday Night Lights. the fact that they don't use any vocals whatsoever makes me love them even more--that their pieces leave it all up to you to feel and visualize whatever you want. My boyfriend just mailed me the first season of F.N.L. and i just thought the pilot was really mindblowing. (partially b/c of the intensity in the football game, mostly b/c of E.I.T.S.) i'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes!! (if i have time).P.S. to all E.I.T.S. fans--they are coming back to the east side (NYC) on March 2008"
1,not what i expected,the name of the song atthe beginning of the dallas carter game is refused: new noise
4,"""Be Perfect""","For anyone who grew up in Texas, this film should strike a chord. This soundtrack which serves as a calling card for the group, Explosions In The Sky"" captures the highs and lows and the ghostly whispers West Texas. My only gripe is that The Stooges' ""I wanna be your dog"" ZZ tops ""Just Got paid"" along with ""New Noise"" by Refused were left off, perhaps for fear of unbalancing this great soundtrack. At any rate this soundtrack should have a place in your collection."
2,"Beware: Not the songs from the film, only instrumentals","This is not the CD I was looking for! I have to agree with B. Mikels: I bought this CD because I loved much of the music in the film, but the only stuff that appears on this sountrack album are the instrumentals which are nice, but not the fantastic music that accompanied and enhanced some of the great scenes in this terrific movie. Songs performed by Public Enemy, Motley Crue, ZZ Top, Joey Scarbury, Run DMC, Poison, LA Guns, are all missing! Where is Shoot For Thrills? Or the Hawaii Five-O theme, or Louie Louie or any of the other terrific music that was in the film? How do I get THAT collection?"
2,What happened,Don't you hate it when you hear a song while watching a movie and its like the coolest song you have ever heard and then you go and dowload it and its lost it magic?
3,NEED HELP,wat is the song that is played during the party towards the beginning of the party it is in the house during the white party (...)
2,Good Soundtrack-For those who don't know the band,"Get this if you've never heard of Explosions in the Sky..Maybe, just maybe, you will be introduced to a new band that can do incredible things for you- that is if you have some sort of attention span, and respect for what beauty via audio would want to do for you!..If you are a fan however, and are looking for a good addition to your collection, steer clear, as the majority of the songs are variations on themes from their real, infinitly better albums.."
5,Love this band,"Explosions came to my college a couple years back as an opener for another band and absolutely blew my mind. I had never heard music like this before, and one of the guitarists was cool enough to let me hang with him after the show and tell me all about his gear so I could (attempt to) replicate some of their distinctive guitar sounds on my own. I am so ecstatic that these guys have been able to get on a major motion picture soundtrack to share their sound with a nationwide audience. Their music truly inspires. Beautiful, beautiful stuff."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this cd as a fan of Explosions in the Sky, not a fan of the movie. A lot of the songs on this soundtrack are only chopped up/switched around versions of the band's full length songs from other releases. It doesn't have the same raw energy that the other releases do, and it's very over produced. I wouldn't recommend this to fans of the band, unless you are a die hard fan and absolutely have to own every EITS release."
3,Refused,"For anyone trying to find the other music from the film not featured on the instramental soundtrack, go buy the Refused - The shape of punk to come CD. This CD features the Final game intro song titled New Noise. Refused is pretty old school so I am happy they got this opportunity to be in this film, too bad the Soundtrack went in the direction it did.""Can I Scream"""
4,I wish it could have been longer.....,"This is an excellent collection of essays by black male writers, excluding the gay part, because as mentioned time and again in many of these essays they must come to terms with their African-American heritage before they even think of coming to terms with their sexuality. I only wish that some of the essays were longer and some not edited. Essays that stood out for me were Coloring Outside the Lines, The Letter, and Dearest Brother Set. They and many others have helped me to evaluate the inner predjudice that lies within the gay community itself, a community whose so called main goal was to establish equality. Don't get me wrong, not all of these essays were like that but of those chosen for this book, essays of that matter were the ones that stood out the most."
3,It was okay,"I guess the reason I couldn't get into this book is because it was written by so many different authors, each complete with their own writing style. Some essays, I feel, were better written than others and some were just worth skipping over."
3,Pleasing kiddies movie,"Though ""Rover Dangerfield"" never lacks the comic zaniness of a full-length animated movie, it's sort of risque and crude, with the king of comedy Rodney Dangerfield voicing the dog, producing and even CONTRIBUTING to the lyrics of some of those songs! Talk about ""I'll never do it on a Christmas Tree"" (which I hated) getting a bad rap.But what makes ""Rover Dangerfield enjoyable is its comic zaniness, excellent plot, and its happy ending. But watch out for scantily-clad animated Vegas showgirls and risque song lyrics and humor. It's definitely a no-no for the kiddies, if you know what I mean."
1,Second Day of Christams Review,"For the second of Christmas I'm going to review....Rover Dangerfield. The only good thing about this film is the animation. Everything else stinks. This is Rodney Dangerfield at his worst. It's basiclly the same thing when Celebrities try to write kids books. Everyone thinks they can do it but it takes talent to do it right but in this case they don't. Too many one-liners and total lack of development. It's clumsy at best. There are also some scences that are too dark for most kids like the dead turkey scence,the scence where we see the ladies in their dressing half-naked and scences where they talk about killing somebody. The songs are gargabe and just as bad as the songs from the Tom & Jerry film. Overall,If you want to see a good Rodney Dangerfield Movie? Go watch Caddyshack or Back To School. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,This is NOT a family movie....no way!,"I was going to show this DVD at work for a family movie day. I didn't preview it, because I saw that it was rated G. Most movies that are rated G are decent for families.In the first few moments of the movie, Rover comments on a poodle's anatomy...I believe he refers to her ""puffs""? Then we see Las Vegas showgirls scantily dressed...next, a guy connected with the mafia, drunk and smoking a cigarette.Um, which part of this is for families?I was totally embarrassed, immediately turned the movie off and apologized to my patrons and put in a REAL family movie...in this case, the original Parent Trap from 1961.I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 16. Heck, I wouldn't recommend it to adults."
5,Hysterical,"This movie is one of the funniest, hippest movies that adults and children alike will love. It is the wise-cracking Rodney Dangerfield at his best. He is funniest when he is trying to be innocent (in his stand-up as well) and this movie is a perfect vehicle for him. A must for any movie library!"
5,Rover Dangerfield,Great movie used to watch it when I was a kid and just introduced it to my neices and nephews and they love it!!!
5,Finally just what I wanted,This movie has been a family favorite since our daughter was just a little one. I have been looking for the disc off and on for about 4 years and I can't tell you how pleased I was to finally find it! Thanks for offering such an eclectic item!
4,"Fun for big kids, too","My family loves this movie. It used to be a Christmas time staple when I was younger and I couldn't find it in stores anywhere. It's funny, and you'll be singing the Christmas tree song for days after watching it. It does have some inappropriate connotations, so if you're one of those stingy ""coddle the children"" people, I suggest you view it for yourself before watching it with the kiddos."
3,good but can be improved,"It is good to have a reference, but it must be absolutely improved.Items like how it is organized is a critical item.Also it is mostly for US celebrities autographs, but if you are looking for non-US celebrities, you may be disappointed."
5,Works great,I was skeptical about this unit but the ease of use and programability of it impressed me. I would definitely recomend it.
5,Absolutely love it!,"I had an earlier version of the Keurig, but it did not have the programmable features this one offers - choice of 4 different cup sizes, always ready to go. It also has a light-up feature that I also love. If possible, I would rate this brewing system as a 10!"
3,Missing items from a sealed box!,"I bought my wife this item for Christmas. I was going to get a sample pack of k cups for it, but the item description (and the box) both say it includes a 12 cup sample pack. Once received, in a sealed shipping box, the item inside had been opened, the k-cups were removed, and the cord had also been unwound. Not amazon's fault since they ship in a sealed box from keurig, just poor QC on keurigs part. Not a good first impression!"
3,Great for awhile....,"As many others have said, this brewer is great until it starts half-cupping. I spend about 1/2 the morning sticking paper clips into the nozzle to no avail. I guess the pump gives out. Has to be replaced about every year."
1,It will inevitably break,"I've had my Keurig for about two years. It broke and I've tried everything. Scale has built up in the pump and now they are recommending you use filtered water. How about having a filter built in like a brita? No amount of descaling using vinegar has been able to get my Keurig working consistently. This product is designed so that there is no way to open it up to clean out scale that has built up inside of the machine. And of course, Keurig can do nothing but offer me the same model at a discount. I think for a $100+ coffee pot, it should work longer than two years.(I do not leave my machine on when I am not using it and make two cups a day at most. So I'd consider it lightly used.)"
1,keurig B70,"Don't buy to expensive, first one only lasted about 13 months. Because we had a lot of K-cups bought another it lasted 2 weeks took it back to Kohl's department store and they replaced it. The new one was not even used because the water tank did'not fit properly (the plastic hook would not hold the tank in place) returned it for another an hopefully it will last longer than the others. We only make no more than 3 cups a day."
2,Great Machine if it would only work for more than a year,"This is my 2nd coffee maker from Keurig and they both came down with the same problem after about a year. They just stop working. I've de-scaled it on a regular basis and even went so far as to only use filtered water on the 2nd machine. Don't get me wrong I love the coffee, but to only last about a year and to fork out over $100 each time is just not cost effective for me... I've owned a Cuisinart drip coffee maker over 5 yrs and paid around $100 and it still works great... My suggestion is to make sure you register it and keep your factory warranty information because I'm 90% sure you will be asking for a replacement before the warranty runs out..."
4,Coffee time,"Great item, very easy to use,no waste, and easy to clean, but seen better deals at BestBuy, and CostCo, but you do save on taxes."
4,questioning quality,Less than 30 days old and keeps asking me to prime the machine. Didn't keep packing so I am dealing with Keurig and hope they will replace if problem persists.
1,Great while it works,"It is the best coffee maker I've ever owned. The trouble is it does not last very long. The first one I bought stopped working in about 20 months. Since I really loved the way it worked while it did, I bought another one. This one stopped working after 14 months. (The warranty is for 12 months.)I may go and buy another one but I'll buy an extended warranty at the same time."
1,some times works some times not,some times it works fine some times it wont take water into the system to make coffe have to shake it a little then it will take the water in
1,big disapointment,"after receiving a keurig as a gift i was so excited. the coffee was good and the operation was simple. i then purchased 4 as gifts and 3 others purchased it after seeing it at my house. this appliance has a life span of about 6 mos to 18 months. you can descale all you want the appliance dies after that time. not one is still working after 18 months. i am waiting for a call back from keurig for 5 days now, still no result. if i had checked with consumers before i bought them i would have seen the low rating. i think that almost $200. for such a short life span is much too much money and the service is terrible."
2,Not reliable,"I thought this was the best thing since sliced bread....until the brew size stopped working, I am on my second machine and the same thing is happening after only a few months with the replacement and now the temp. is not very hot. Great idea but they need to work out the problems!"
5,In coffee heaven,I've used this machine for about a year and it works great. The bolder coffees when brewed on the smallest setting have a little crema on top at times. This brews the best tea I've ever tasted. I love when a product delivers all that it promises.
1,Keurig could be better.,"I had to return this product, because it did not work. It cost me $23.19 in return shipping with UPS, which the seller did not cover. I will not buy from this seller again."
2,"Slow to start, but seems better now","We bought this maker as an upgrade. We have 2 of the smaller older models both in our offices. This one looks great, makes a wider variety of sizes, makes a hot fast cup, and is VERY quiet. The big problem we encountered was it required a full day of decanting (running vinegar through the machine instead of water) to get the flavor cleaned up. The initial 15 cups tasted so much like PLASTIC we had to dump them! So after a series of decanting and then running only water for about 10 containers full, it is now making a tasty cup of regular coffee. Of course, this may not be the coffee maker for people who love the last cup from a pot that's been brewing all day."
4,If you're a lazy person...,"you'll love the Keurig system! Just be ready for weak coffee, loud vibrations that rattle your cupboards, and always filling a half-empty water container. We buy 'bold' coffee and are finally getting used to it (since we're lazy). I thought I could stay with my preferred 50% decaf brewing with their metal filter, but that's like doing brain surgery -- gave up -- just use the K-cups. We put the machine on a rubber mat, and put the coffee cup on a sponge, now it's just LOUD. Not LOUD LOUD :-) We should have gotten a cheaper version; turns out the programmable function only saves a couple of minutes and runs up our electric bill.And you should buy it direct from Amazon, not one of their outside vendors (had minor problems with the ""Small Appliances"" place)."
2,"If Specialty Coffee Is Your Thang, Do NOT Buy!","I was really excited to get this machine, hearing lots of good reviews about it and exploring the over 200 fabulous (sounding) flavors that are offered. However, when i got the machine, there was only one taste i could find: bitter. I tried over 15 different k-cups, ultimately only liking one, the cafe mocha (escape). None of the flavors could be tasted properly. Gingerbread, hazelnut, french vanilla, breakfast blend: BLECH!*If you are the person who goes to Starbucks for flavored coffees and frappuccinos, do NOT buy!The only reason i gave this 2 stars is the concept, simply putting a cup in and some water and receiving coffee in less than 20 seconds.Great idea, terrible coffee."
3,Serious Design Flaw,"I just started using and so far like it, and glad I bought it. There are however two very obvious design flaws. The maximum size of 12 ounce output, is the minimum size of coffee that they sell at almost every place that sells coffee nowadays. Could this be a clue that people want larger output? A quick check here on Amazon shows that the average travel mug is 16 oz and larger. Could this be a clue of what people want? Of course I happen to be one of the millions that own a travel mug, and like most, it will not fit the machine. Looking at all the travel mugs sold here you will note that if they made the area 1 inch higher most mugs would fit. Come on engineers, wake up! Because of the poor design, I have to output to a coffee cup and then poor into the travel mug. I would bet a lot of others are having to do the same. Now, I have to buy a new travel mug. Open for suggestions."
1,Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System,"I purchased this coffee maker from Amazon. I have had it about 2 weeks and it brewed coffee excellent. There were no leaks or any problems. This morning I put a cup in and turned it to brew and nothing happened. It tried to pump and then shut off. I fooled around with it for about 1/2 hour, but finally declared that it had died. I really liked it and will order another as soon as I get a refund on this one. I hope I can give it a better review than I did this one."
5,Keuric K-Cup Coffeemaker,"INCREDIBLE!!This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. I just can't say enough positive about this coffeemaker and the pleasure it has brought into our home. If you love coffee and want the single most enjoyable coffee experience, THIS IS IT!!!BUY ONE!!"
1,Wanna pay more for bad coffee with extra environmental waste?,"Well you're in luck.If it wasn't for so many other commonplace consumer blunders, I would be shocked that these Keurig units have become a mainstay in coffee drinking culture. The fundamental problems as I see it with all these singe serve models are:1. You pay more for coffee.2. The coffee is generally poor quality to start, but the brewing process ensures a bad cup of coffee.3. There are now millions of non-recyclable little plastic cups headed for the landfill.Want a good single cup of coffee, get a quick boiler and a french press, or a single drip cup for over your mug.Virtually any other method of producing a single cup of coffee (while taking perhaps 30 sec. more time) will give you a better cup at a cheaper price."
1,Keurig a bad buy!,My machine died after 1yr and 10 mo. ThAt is why they only give one yr warranty. Also it clogs up frequently. I don't recommend the keurig
2,"You will pay about $10 a month to ""rent"" this...",...then you will need to buy another one. On my third sold from various sources. They all died like clockwork at around 13-15 months.
5,Wow! An impressive machine.,"I was really skiddish about buying such an expensive machine, especially after calculating costs versus my manual cone-drip system. However, after purxchasing this together with the Ekobrew reusable K-cups, I am just blown away at the quality of the machine. The B70 is a solid and well made machine. It is so easy to use that after reading the ""Getting Started"" manual for both the machine and the Ekobrew cups, I made a perfect cup of coffee. So far, after over 100 brews, the B70 is still chugging along, no muss, no fuss. I recommend this machine highly to all coffee afficianados out there that want a quick and perfect cup of coffee."
1,10 Short Months and My Keurig is Already Dead!,"How frustrating! I used it without problem for the entire 10 months. Then all of a sudden this morning, I brew one cup of coffee and it was apparently its last. It's just dead. No error message, no weird noises. Just a dead, blank screen. I had such high hopes mine would be the exception. But no. I hesitate to get another one, but it's just so darn convenient. If anyone has tried the Tassimo as a replacement to the Keurig--is it any better?"
2,we have gone through 3 of these,"We have had 3 of the Keurig platinum coffee makers over the past 4 years. Despite using distilled water for almost every single cup we made, the coffee maker still got scaled up. we have cleaned ours numerous times with vinegar and we have been dissappointed with the results. We love the k-cups and the variety of coffee we can use but we will be trying a different k-cup machine besides the keurig next time :-("
1,Keurig: The coffee maker that doesn't work,"I purchased the higher-end Keurig a year ago and loved it. It kept me happy until it began to clog. I would place the coffee pod into the machine, and water would not process through the pod. It would overflow the pod and make a mess. I rinsed it with clean water and still, it would clog. Nothing worked! It was junk. A few co-workers were talking about coffee makers and one person asked how I like my Keurig. I told the co-worker that it broke long ago and went into the trash. The co-worker told me that the same thing happened to their Keurig and to another co-worker's Keurig.My recommendation: DO NOT BUY!! They make great coffee ... while they work ... but they are junk machines!"
2,Great when working,"I've owned this unit for about 8 months and have had all the exact same issues with my brewer that you'll see on all the 1-2 star reviews. When it works, it's a fantastic little coffee maker, but absolutely infuriating when it won't draw water. Tells me to descale when I've already run gallons of vinegar through it, etc. I'm seriously considering not purchasing another one even with the all the convenience these offer."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"I really did some research before buying a pod coffee maker. I picked this one for the variety of coffee makers you could get pods from and also the size of the cup you could make. Most have one small size cup and that it is. I got it and it works wonderful, the coffee is so fresh and tasty. I would recommend this to anyone. Little more expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for.Enjoy, Nola :)"
5,Perfect!,"This product is perfect. I had to send back the one I purchased on Amazon because it wouldn't pump the water but I purchased another one (same model) and I see no reason to go back to a conventional coffee maker. I love this machine for cofee, iced coffee, tea, and iced tea. I wish one would be made that could be hooked up to a water source because we use it so much that we are constantly refilling it. We get about 4 or 5 servings from it at a time depending on what we are making with it. There's very little clean up involved so this is an extremely easy way to enjoy your coffee and tea beverages without spending tons of money at Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Dunkin Donuts, or any other coffee house. We love it and highly recommend it to anyone else."
1,Keep your receipt handy!,"Buyer beware! Received 25 Dec 09, and it stopped working properly 15 Jan 10. Right in line with many other negative Keurig reviews. The water stopped filling the heating reservoir. We had to unplug/plug back in, and pull out/replace the water tank each time we brewed a cup of coffee. We aren't heavy coffee drinkers, and would estimate we brew 2 cups a day. Our local Bed Bath & Beyond was great and let us exchange for another, with the option to bring back for refund if we have any further issues. Wouldn't have bothered with a second unit, but love the convenience and quality of the coffee. Crossing fingers, and will update if the other Keurig goes the way of the dodo."
5,Perfect for the home office,"I work at home when I'm not traveling to customers' sites. The B70 fills my coffee and tea needs all day. I usually drink about 5 cups of coffee throughout the day. I enjoy having it on-demand and being able to make it quickly. I prefer the k-cups made by Timothy's, especially their Nicaraguan bold and Sumatran bold. For teas, I enjoy the Timothy's Lemon Blueberry.Many reviews focus on the poor coffee strength. That is why I prefer those ""bold"" types by Timothy's and other coffee vendors. They have more coffee and produce a stronger-tasting drink."
3,Keurig B-70 Coffee Maker,"For an item that is made in China & what they pay labor thee, one would think this product would cost us consumers 1/3 the amount! What happened to American manufacturing?"
2,Coffee tastes like plastic,"this coffee maker sucks. we washed it several times, coffee still had a bad after taste. changed the coffee type that came with the maker and still tasted bad."
1,Appealling...but never again!,"Our second B70 model has failed. First one from 2009 lasted 10 months; stopped brewing much at all, even though we followed cleaning instructions regularly. Replacement from Keurig lasted 13 months. Now selecting brew results in little or no action: no pumping, no brewing...nothing. At ~$200 per year, need to find another option for convenient coffee and tea."
4,Machine failed after 1 year... called keurig they sent out another right away,"The machine failed after over a year of great coffee daily. Gotta hand it to them though... they sent out another machine as soon as i called, even though it was out of warranty.... WHAT A COMPANY!!! to stand behind their product like that!!! no questions asked!good for you keurig! we could only wish more companies had your candor and integrity!!!!"
3,Mine too died within a year,"I love the convenience of the Keurig system and wish someone was licensed to make a brewer that was well made. This one was not! It worked flawlessly for 6 months, then the cup size became erratic and a few months later...no coffee... I will get another, but, please, make a ""heavy duty"" one that will last!"
1,Keurig won't fool me twice.,"Most of the five-star reviews on here appear to be from people who've owned their Keurig for a week or two. Yes, mine worked great back then. After about 9 months, averaging less than one cup per day (clearly not over-use) mine started ""short-cupping"". I have experienced the same poor results as others utilizing the telephonic customer service suggestions. My unit does fine when I run straight water through it, but it doesn't have the oomph to force water through the K-cups, and the backflow dribbles the water back into the reservoir. Clearly this is a pump problem, not a plugged line. Mine has passed the warranty period now, so I am simply going to resurrect my Hamilton Beach Brew Station which still works well after many more cups than the Keurig ever did. The Keurig cost three times as much but didn't last a year. No, there will not be a 2nd Keurig in my home, let alone a 3rd or 4th! Buy one if you dare, but don't expect it to last beyond a year."
1,Quit working less than two weeks after purchase!,"Although this brewer is convenient and makes great coffee, I can't recommend it. I bought a new model and it quit working in less than two weeks. The display would read ""not ready"" and then the machine would turn itself off. I searched the internet to see if other people had this problem and learned it is a major problem. I'm mostly disappointed with the Keurig customer service. I called them on a Sunday. You speak to a representative who takes your information. Then, a specialist has to return your call within 24-48 hours. They returned my call 3 days later and outside of the times I said I was available. Unfortunately, my husband checked the voice mail and found it unintelligible and deleted it. I called Keurig back later that day and couldn't speak to a specialist again, and have to wait the 24-48 hours again for a return call. I feel ripped off after spending that amount of money on a defective coffee maker."
1,Unit failed in 26 days,"Started out nicely, but on the 26th day of ownership the B70 developed this problem:After brewing a K-Cup, the unit does not suck in water and after it times out, the blue 'low water level' light flashes, even though the reservoir is nearly full. This can be cleared only by unplugging the B70 so that it reboots, but that wipes out all programming. This has to be done after each cup.We returned it for a refund and went back to our 3-year old Keurig."
1,Beware!! There is a serious design flaw with this model,"My Keurig Platinum worked perfectly for one blissful week. Then the machine began to turn off after finishing the brewing cycle. It's necessary to pick up the water tank and drop it back into place several times until the water begins to draw down. Once you can get it to brew, the coffee is excellent, however it's a big annoyance to have to finagle the tank after nearly every cup. Keurig should't continue to sell this product when they know that it has this flaw, and I will not be purchasing any other products from this company."
5,coffee,I love it. My son and I are coffee drinkers. We wasted coffee with the other coffee makers. But now we just put the coffee in per cup and have nice hot coffee for one.
1,Poor Workmanship,"I've owned two Keurigs in 3 years. Both died. The first one died within the one year warranty, so that was good. The second one died after two years so that was bad and Keuring wouldn't do anything. For the price of these coffee makers, they should have a longer warranty. I have many friends who have had similar problems with their machines malfunctioning in short periods of time. I'm done with Keurig. The machine makes a great cup of coffee, it's just poorly made. I'll go back to my old $30 coffee maker that's been going strong for over 20 years now at work."
3,"Good Product, Except.......","I chose this coffee maker because my daughter has one and it makes a good cup of coffee. The problem is the coffee is not as hot as I like it, and if you are a heavy coffee drinker it could get pretty expensive buying k-cups."
2,Great.... for 2 1/2 years,"I loved our B70 model till it broke down. The water was pumping to the back but not releasing from there. We did all trouble shooting recommended by Kuerig customer service. At the end, her reslove was to offer me a new one at a discounted price of $119. We bought it for $150. Now that im left with a bunch of kcups, I have to get another k-cup coffee maker priced minimally at $100. Definitely not getting a Kuerig."
5,one cup,I bought the B70 a few weeks ago and having a great time with it. I put it on in the morning and whenever I want a cupper I can make it in less than a minute. I got some k-cups on sale so I am set for a while. I often use it just for the hot water and use tea or herbal bags which work great. I love it and hope that I don't have any problems in the future.
2,Short life expectancy,"We bought this machine Feb 2010 & now it's dead 15 months later. First it started short-cupping and then it more or less quit brewing altogether. It would dump the hot water back into the reservoir. It's been cleaned many times & de-scaled often. I usually used the carbon water filter and it wasn't abused or mistreated. It was just expected to work! It's a great coffee maker while it works BUT...when you factor in the cost of replacing the coffee maker annually/semi-annually & the cost of the K-cups, one might as well go to Starbucks/DD everyday. Or go back to a drip coffee maker (my old drip machine is still going strong after 8+ years). The reliability of this coffee maker is extremely short for the money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Bought this product for our office. Worked well for 13 months then stopped working. After having googled this and read many reviews I have realized that this product is very poorly designed. Our coffee maker started by short cupping. Then I attempted to descale it by pouring literally gallons of vinegar through it per the descale instructions. This did nothing to remedy the problem. In fact the computer started to malfunction and pour all of the vinegar/water out without heating it. Descaling did not work. Finally after weeks of trying to fix it I have given up. Of course it is one month past the warranty so I have no recourse. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Numerous other consumers have had the same problem. If you see a good review it is usually not related to reliability/durability. It usually starts with...""I've had this product for 2 days and it works great"" Fair warning."
5,Hard to Beat This One,"We received our machine as a Christmas gift.I wanted to wait a while to do my review. It seems some people have had problems with this model. My wife and I love our Keurig, We got rid of our old coffee pot, and use this one several times a day. Easy to set up, a snap to use, and not much to clean up later. And no problems whatsoever. Highly Recommended!"
1,"3rd Down, none to go","I am on my 3rd B-70 in less than 2 years. The 3rd one lasted 3 weeks. Same problem as everyone else is having. I love the coffee it makes, but I'm tired of trading machines. There is something in the design of the B-70 that isn't right, as witness to the number of 1 star ratings this particular machine has gotten."
1,Worthless junk. Waste of money.,"I'm glad that other companies are now making machines that accept K-Cups, because I will never buy another Keurig brewer again. I had this unit for only a little over a year when it suddenly just stopped brewing. I tried cleaning and de-scaling multiple times, with no luck. It's now in my trash.If you want a coffee maker that will last for a year or so, then I suppose you're OK getting this. If you want one that's worth what you pay for it, stay away."
3,Great when it works,This machine makes great coffee but has been replaced once under warranty and is again not pumping out coffee as it should every time. Works about 50% of the time now. I do de-scale on a regular basis but I suspect that it is the pump that is not working correctly as I hear it turn off when it stops working.I'm looking for a more reliable model.
1,Makes Krap Koffee,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I can say this with complete confidence: Keurig machines do not make good coffee. Both of my lazy siblings and my stepmom bought them because of excellent marketing. After experimenting many, many times and honestly trying to get a decent cup of coffee out of them, I give up. I would rather have nothing than this blech. If you want a cup of something vaguely resembling weak coffee in 30 seconds, spend your $170 on this. If you want honest to God coffee, get a press pot or a cheap drip maker from Goodwill that steeps the grounds for +/- 5 minutes. The garbage Folgers we put in a perculator at BSA camp makes MUCH better coffee. Seriously."
1,"Great when it works, just died for no apparent reason.","This Platinum B70 coffee maker was working just fine for the last 2 months I have used it. Today, I came home, and it keeps saying ""NOT READY"", but I have enough water in the reservoir, and it is primed, and I have switched several k-cups in with no obstructions. I wish the machine would tell me specifically why it is not ready; I have absolutely no idea why it stopped working. Very frustrating when you pay $200 for a coffee maker, and it goes out in the first couple of months of using it. Now I have a cheap plastic P.O.S., and I am not very happy about it."
1,best coffee,IM very happy have never tastes a better coffee no waste and does not even take a minute to brew
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought the platinum B70 and it immediately stopped working correctly. The thing repeatedly turned off for no reason whatsoever and if I had the patience to wait for it to work and the machine decided to randomly cooperate it would probably take 15 minutes to make a single cup of coffee. I would start it, it would make some noise like it was working and then shut off. Restart it...shut off. Restart it...shut off. Unplug it and start over and sometimes it would work. So I sent it back for an exchange and the new one I received did the same thing so I sent it back again but this time I asked for a refund. It turns out you get only an 80% refund even though it is faulty and doesn't work right and even though I sent it within 30 days. So I am out $31.00. Then I bought a standard model at Costco. It shuts off by itself too. So I'm 0 for 3 and I'm very surprised this hasn't happened to a lot more people. I doubt if 0 for 3 is just bad luck! Don't buy it!"
1,4 Keurigs DIED - do not buy,"after having gone thru 4 of the Keurig Platinum editions in under 15 months, I officially DO NOT RECOMMEND this product. Machine #1 seemed to suffer from bi-polar disorder and would randomly not be in the mood to brew coffee...so it wouldn't. Then, it stopped brewing all together...couldn't get it to brew no matter how many times I restarted it or how perfectly I cleaned it...so, on to Keurig #2. Within a few weeks Keurig #2 began acting up in the same manner. After reading several blogs regarding Keurig care, I decided that the best plan would be to weekly remove every removable part there was and scrub the crap out of it. Although cleaning on a weekly basis, Keurigs #2 and #3 each quit on me. I contacted Keurig who told me that I needed to clean the machine better...what the? On to Keurig #4 - which decided on the SECOND CUP that it wasn't going to brew anymore. Clearly, this is NOT an issue of maintaining the machine. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
5,Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing system,"I gave this a high rating because I really Love my keurig. I enjoy having the ability to brew 1 hot cup of coffee at a time. I can have a flavored coffee and my husband can have a bold roast regular coffee. We can brew different sizes. The large reservoir is easy to remove, so you can refill with water.i'm glad I bought the keurig."
1,GREAT... for a few months,"This machine is really convenient, and makes nice coffee. The problem is that they are COMPLETELY unreliable and will stop working properly within short order. This unit worked fine for several months and then started shutting off every time after one cycle. I thought it was a cleaning/maintence issue and maybe I needed to do something to clean it out. Turns out, if you google the problem, there's thousands of discussion posts by users with similar problems. Many of them are on the 3rd and 4th replacements. The company is apparently good about honoring replacements, warranties and all, but who wants to spend this kind of chedda and go through the hassle of sending for a replacement twice a year!"
1,Dont waist your time or $$,"My in-laws got me this machine as a new house warming gift. I was so excited!! Then it only worked for 3 days. They took it back to costco and ordered me another one (same maching) here on Amazon. Got the Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System on Friday, and today is Sunday and it will not brew a cup. It is like the water is not getting pushed threw to the 'down spout'. Same problem as the last machine that only lasted 3 days as well. I totally thought i had to be a fluke! But i will not be getting the same machine for a 3rd time. Sad, without coffee!!!"
5,More than expected,"I was more than pleased with the Keurig unit, it is easy to use and a great cup of coffee."
5,Quality Brewer,Easy to use and brews all your favorites. Keurig has hit a winner with this system that brews coffee and teas. I highly recommend it !!!
2,"End Product Is Great, Hardware Not So Much","My wife purchased the B60 model for our home in December of '09. After 2 months of use it stopped working as it was designed - pump failure. I returned it and decided to upgrade to the B70 model. After only three days of use the B70 began having the same issues as the B60, the pump would run for about 2 minutes and the unit would shutoff.Again, I returned the brewer and replaced it with another B70 unit. For roughly two weeks our third brewer worked flawlessly. Now, we're returning it for a fourth. Same issue...pump runs for a couple of minutes and then shuts off.I rated the B70 with 2 stars. If the end product, the coffee, wasn't such high quality I would have rated the B70 a 1 star. If you're in the market for a Keurig brewer I would wait until they redesign the pump before making your purchase. Too much money to buy K-cups and never get to use them and enjoy a nice cup of Joe.Footnote: we always use filtered water in our brewers as Keurig suggests."
2,Great Coffee POOR QUALITY PRODUCT ! BREAKS OFTEN !,"I have now purchased 4 of these machines, and can say the Coffee from them is delicious... Every Cup is great and all the flavors are wonderful... The Bad thing is all of the Keurig B70's I have purchase have the exact same problem after just a few uses... I would not recommend this manufacturer... They all stop pumping the water and need to be turned on and off several times to work each time a cup is made... You can on occasion get a couple cups before the pump stops and needs to be recycled. I have replaced one unit and the replacement does the same thing... I only use filtered bottled water in them so it is NOT due to using tap water as the manufacturer wants to blame...In Short, I love the k-cup coffee, but the quality of the machine itself is poor and not dependable."
4,"Overall, satisfied",The machine wasnt completely drained before it arrived so there was a lot of water in it and in the box. It did function properly though and it arrived it the expected time.
4,Does what it says on the tin.,"Just got this machine Saturday (It's Sunday night). I got the B70, the charcoal filter starter kit, the self-filter kit and some various K cup coffees. I'm very impressed with the unit. The fit and finish are very good. The machine has a lot of weight to it - this indicates good construction to me. Nothing ""wiggles"". Things that swivel do so without wobble. Things that go up and down do so smoothly.Setup took about 15 minutes, it took longer to soak and prep the charcoal filter than anything else.The Keurig goes from cold to ""ready to brew"" in about 3 minutes. Once it starts to brew, it finishes in less than a minute, with about 15 seconds to load more water once its ready to go again. Its very clean, the process itself lends itself to a very orderly and tidy way to make a cup of coffee with no fuss.The coffee itself is quite good, lots of varieties but I don't know much about them. I got a good strong Kona and will be testing different varieties as I go."
1,Price is rediculous..,Costco has the same machine for $145 with 60 k-cups... Just rediculous.. Starting to sigh on amazon.... Prices this season have been jacked sky high...
2,Wanted to love it but......,"I really wanted to love this. After trying a variety pack of coffee k-cups, today I have decided to return it to Costco whence it came.My biggest problem was that I was not enjoying my morning cup of coffee. Sadly, I do not know if it is me, or the coffee after reading so many great reviews.The coffee tastes flat and has a bit of an aftertaste. There was also no complexity to the flavor. I find the flavor is similar to trying to use the french press to make 1 cup versus the 4 cups it can hold. For some reason when using the french press I need to make the entire 4 cups to get the best flavor. I also bring my water to a boil and then let it sit for 20 seconds or so before adding it to the coffee grounds. I was looking forward to simplicity without the waste here.Tomorrow I will go back to using my french press.I give this product 2 stars for concept, and it looks great on my counter."
5,Fantastic Coffe!,"This coffee maker is a dream! Every cup is brewed correctly. You can have different types of coffee cup to cup if you want as well as tea, hot chocolate or just hot water for soup, etc. No more wasted coffee and mess to clean-up. Highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants versatility in their coffee cup to cup, day to day, etc."
1,Two died within a year,"I bought a B-70 for my home. We enjoyed it for about six months, and then it died-- refused to put any water out. I called Keurig, and they blamed it on me, saying I didn't rinse it often enough or thoroughly enough. But they replaced it. The new one lasted a couple of months and died the same death.I'm back to a Bodum. It always works."
5,Received the Upgraded Keurig K75 Platinum Brewer,Brewer came with a Keurig water filter kit. Seems I'm one of the first to receive the K75. From the box to a great cup of coffee in no time. Came with some cofee samples. Received the brewer in 3 days. Let's see how it holds up.
2,Good taste but...,"First of all, make sure you get the Platinum PLUS machine. It doesn't cost much more, and it has a rinse button. This ad seems to be for the plain Platinum machine but I don't see Plus on Amazon anywhere so something is weird.The coffee that comes out of this machine tastes really good, but I hate the machine itself. It is so SLOW. I'd rather just drive to Dunkin Donuts. The water trickles out in a slow drip, which causes maximal splash-back all over the machine. Even when I just want hot water it droooools out so slow. And the controls are hard to remember, I'm always press press pressing to try to get the right size cup of water. I wish I got a different model, maybe not the Keurig brand, but still using the K-Cups."
1,Very Disappointed in Product Quality,"After visiting a relative, I bought a Kuerig Platinum coffee maker and persuaded my mom and aunt to do the same. Now about a year later, all three of the coffee makers no longer work. We have tried everything in the manual to correct the problem without success. The water flow out of the coffee maker is so slow that you cannot even make a full cup of coffee and descaling does not help. I might be able to justify one of our coffee makers having a problem, but all three? When purchasing a coffee maker for $160.00, I certainly expect it to last longer than a year. Stay away from the Kuerig coffee maker or you'll be buying another one in a short amount of time. Very disappointed in the quality of this product and its longevity!"
4,"B70 with higher capacity water, quiet.","Just ordered B70, nice surprise, came with upgraded 72 oz water container. Sitting on granite, can barely hear the pump, very quiet, and working well, with std Ks and also My K with our own coffee."
1,Screw the Environment,"This product just shows how lazy people have become and just haw ignorant and uncaring people are of the environment. It really is sad. Every serving of poor coffee/hot chocolate/etc required you to throw away a small plastic cup that cannot be recycled and will never break down. That is millions of these lille waste bombs a day!! If you can live with yourself for that, you obviously do not care about the planet or anyone living on it."
1,What is the opposite of Green?,"In a world where we have floating islands of plastic. How does this type of product even get patented, let alone sold and popular? Each cup of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, has a plastic cup that, you guessed it, gets sent to the land fill.I have seen these becoming more popular, instead of doing away with such a trash producer, like I would love to believe this world is moving towards.There must be a better greener way to make coffee! Please don't buy this!I can't give it a star, I wish there were negative stars. (I guess I have to give it one, because it won't let me post without)"
3,The short truth,"Here's how is goes. It's very simple. This is a nice looking machine that is incredibly easy to use, very convenient, saves me a lot of time, that is easy to fill and clean. Truly revolutionary.However, be prepared to drink some awful coffee over the next few months. It has nothing to do with the coffee makers... I think it is a flaw in the way that water brews through, the speed, dilution, etc. Yet to try Dunkin' Donuts own brand (which were annoyingly pulled from everywhere - supposedly can only buy in-store - no go in Nor Cal).So there you go... Short and sweet..."
3,A short romance . . .,"Mine died in less than two years, and it was never heavily used. One day, I simply couldn't turn it on. Before that, I could easily remedy the common issues: a clogged system, etc. Since the warranty lasts only for one year, the best Keurig could do was give me a discount on a new product. I ended up paying around $85.00 for an updated model. I do enjoy the convenience the machine offers-- as well as the many coffee flavors. Still, I am disappointed, as such an expensive item should last a few years. Make certain to register your new Keurig immediately. . ."
1,I hit my b-70,For three months I loved this machine now I beat it with my can opener. It won't brew when it says it ready. Now I am searching for a better model or brand. Any ideas?
1,"Well engineered, awful coffee","We have the B77. Did everything we could think of to ensure a good tasting cup of coffee. Flushed the system, used bottled water, different brews from different suppliers. Could not, no matter what we tried, get a cup of coffee that was not bitter or sour. It's going back."
2,Will wake up the family with NOISE!,"I had an older Keurig machine which was bigger but great. I purchased this Model which looks more like something out of sharper Image. the water container has an internal blue LED light that illuminates the water a Star Trek like blue and will flash when the water gets low. So if you like a nice big cup of Joe or tea you'll need to fill it often. Now that said, about the noise factor - this thing sucks in water and growls very loudly, like a coffee grinder. If you are filling a big mug of coffee, you will need to fill your cup twice which means the machine will have to suck water in 4 TIMES which lasts about 6 or 7 seconds. It rattles anything on the kitchen counter from the vibration frequency. Sounds great doesn't it...."
3,Cover your box!,"Got this today as a gift for the wife for Christmas,and it came with its name all over it.... Thanks for ruining the surprise..."
3,Works fine until out of warranty,"If this coffee maker were still working, I'd rate it 5-stars. Shortly after 1 year of service without a problem, it began stopping in mid stream, er, that is, the stream of coffee stops and the device sits there. Other times it would do nothing at all, or only show a single size cup and then do nothing. It's been cleaned numerous times according to the instructions, and the only way we can get it to work when these problems begin, is to turn the power off, wait a minute, then turn it back on. That works sometime. Or, my favorite solution is to simply hit the top of the device with my hand, a shart rap, and it always starts up.If I do get another, it will probably be the cheapest type, so I'm not out as much money in another year!"
2,2 units quit working after about a year :(,"When it works, it is a good unit. It is very expensive per cup. The parent company owns most of the many brands available for the machine so you get many choices of mostly very average at best coffee. The many choices let you think you'll eventually get a great coffee, but **sigh** you wont find the best beans in the greenmountain or keurig parent owned coffees. The coffee you will get will however make lots of money for keurig. Having said that, it is really fast for a fresh cup of coffee, and works good at making quick tea. You can use the large size setting on the b-70 to make a quick pot of your favorite tea, and that can be gourmet tea if you want which is nice. I have had two units. Both broke after about 11 months to a year. So don't expect them to last for a long time. Still I will probably buy a third. Im a 5-7 cup a day person and sometimes you need a quick fresh cup of average coffee."
3,RIP Keurig,"I enjoyed my Keurig B70 for the two years that it was alive. It would stop working and then I descaled it with Dezkal which worked wonders. This time however, nothing could bring it back to life. I tried three rounds of descaler even leaving it overnight. I tried the paperclip. Nothing but the terrible sounds of what seemed like the pump dying. I spent hours trying to revive it but I am declaring my Keurig dead now. My only consoling thought is that this was a Christmas gift from two years ago so I didn't have to be upset about paying so much money for it. Now I have to make the decision: Electronics recycling or a Free on Craigslist ad..maybe someone knows how to actually fix this thing.The Keuring is wonderful when it works...just take into consideration the price and perhaps buying it somewhere that offers extended warranties. I usually don't get those but considering the reputation of these machines failing soon after warranty, I think it would be worth getting one."
5,Have had this machine for more than a year without incident,"I purchased my machine from Costco more than a year ago and has been using it every morning. I find many of the one star comments curious and unsettling. My experience with this machine has been 5 stars. No complaint whatsoever. So, either I got real lucky and purchased a super machine, or these people are idiots who do not know how to operate this simple machine. I am planning to buy another one for my vacation home because I am happy with the one I have.Later, I bought another one because I was so happy with the first one. Then I reazlie alot of the problem and complants may have been caused by hard water in many parts of the country. I think if everyone follow the instructions and use only purified or filtered water, then the machine should work without a glitch."
3,Best coffee machine ever.... when it works.,"We got this Keurig around December 2010, as a wedding present. It quickly became our favorite wedding gift! We loved it... it worked perfectly, it was quick and quiet, and there are literally hundreds (thousands?) of flavors to choose from. However, after about a year, it would only work about half the time. And now, it works about 1/4th the time... and to our disdain, some mornings it won't work at all. Oh no! We've tried all the ""descaling"" techniques and solutions... and have poured several gallons of vinegar down it by now. So, if it stops working, don't bother with all the effort to ""descale,"" it just doesn't work... the machine has some flaw (reading other reviews here and elsewhere will prove that to you. Anyway, it's a great machine... just plan on getting a new one every year or two. (you'll be too addicted to it to say no!)"
1,Piece of junk,"After a year of use, this thing is wack... Doesn't make a full cup of coffee and I have spent around 15 hours screwing around with this thing to no avail. I am going back to my Walmart 25 dollar Mr Coffee tomorrow morning and I definitely will not look back or miss this overpriced piece of garbage!!!! I wouldn't waste your money on this unless you like a 180 dollar paperweight. I had my old coffee maker for 8 years and it only cost 30 bucks... Wish i would've kept it instead of giving it away... Then I could have just punted this POS Keurig out the door!!!"
5,Rolling review-starting at 5 stars April 2012,April 2012-I got myself this machine after using another Keurig model at work. It's only been a couple of weeks but I've had no problems. I did buy this refurbished so I'm hoping the kinks were worked out before I received it. I'm going to be doing a rolling review and update since there are so many complaints about this model.I'm looking forward to great tasting coffee and less waste. My husband & I were notorious for making a full pot of coffee and not finishing it. It's been nice to not have to pour coffee down the drain for the last couple of weeks.Keeping my fingers crossed that there will be no negative updates!
3,Occasional Flashing light,"This is my 3rd Keurig machine. The others lasted 2-3 years each. I've had thisone a month. This one works fine except that about every 15 - 20 cups, the light for the water flashes as if it were empty and it may be full or half full. I then have to lift the water reservior out and put it back in to stop the light. Apparently something gets out of sync with the water pump."
3,Great while it works,"5 stars for the product while it works. Extremely convenient and very fresh coffee since the k-cups are sealed and you are brewing just one cup at a time, i.e. your coffee doesn't get old or burnt sitting in a coffee carafe on the burner/warmer waiting for you to refill your cup. Another plus over a conventional coffee maker is that you don't waste much if any coffee because you will probably drink the whole cup when made via the Keurig vs. letting the extra coffee sit in a carafe that you never drink.1 star for reliability for my unit. Mine stopped working at approximately 9 months of use; it just wouldn't pump the water out.5 stars for service. Mine had a 1 year warranty and they replaced it at no charge to me. Thank you!So the big question is: what is the expected life of one of these units? It would be interesting to hear from Keurig what they think the expected life of the B70 is in terms of years and/or k-cups brewed."
1,Keurig Stopped Working,"After only 43 days, this machine stopped working. It would not pull water through, therefore it would not brew, it wouldn't clean...it just quit. Customer Service was awful...almost non-existent. We returned the Keurig, and replaced it with the Cuisinart that brews K-Cups. It cost more, but it has worked beautifully and is virtually the same machine. It feels more solid, also.I cannot tell anyone that the Keurig is worth the money. As one reviewer said, take out the pump to make it a bit lighter when you toss it in the trash!"
1,Do not use if you have softened water,"I really liked this product. I have a well and have to use softened water. I did not want to buy water just to use this product. I went through 2 units before I gave up. My money was promptly refunded. The company techs said it has something to do with the sodium ions introduced by the salt in my water softener. Although the company recommended using bottled water in their advertisements, they did not mention anything about a water softener. Had they mentioned the water softener, I would not have bought the product."
2,Wonderful . . . when it works.,"I received the B70 as a Christmas gift and was thrilled. It took a while to find a coffee strong enough for my taste, but once I tasted Emeril's Big Easy Bold, I was hooked. Unfortunately, within one month my machine malfunctioned like so many others. It would make a loud noise like it was trying to work and then shut off. I called customer service and they sent a new machine. It worked for less than a week! I called again and they sent a second replacement. I was told that the problem had been resolved and I should have no more problems. Unfortunately, though, I have had this third brewer for just over a week and it is already shutting down automatically. I am so disappointed. I like it enough that I don't want to give up on it . . . but, really, enough is enough."
3,Buyer beware of asst variety advertisement,"Recently purchased a Keurig Platinum B70 Gourmet Single Cup Brewing system with 60 k-cups Assortment & Reusable filter.Although the system works well, I purchased the 60 k-cup assortment thinking that I would get a variety to try in order to make future purchases on the ones that I liked. But, after opening, I found that 48 of the 60 were extra bold flavor coffees. I received ONLY 2 hazelnut ""flavored"" coffees and only one tea. I am very disappointed. I was expecting alot more from the Keurig brand."
3,I am happy,"The first machine we got became tempermental and stopped working. The company gladly sent us a new one, no problem. The machine itself is killer. We love everything about it."
2,Works great when it works. Costly per cup of coffee.,"Had the unit now for about 11 months. It has stopped working. I descaled the unit twice and nothing happen. I am in the middle now of working with Keurig customer support. I will report back my results.After hitting the brew button, the pump starts but no water is dispensed. You have to repeat the process until water comes out, then its either too little or too much water."
3,not strong enough,"I got this with a free my-K-cup accessory and a bunch of the little pre-filled plastic cups. It was intended to solve the Royal Family Coffee Crisis that occurs in the mornings due to my, the King, and the Princess of Noirs' caffeine habits that must be fed at the same time with limited brewing capacity. Now, I think that the packaging and discardable component of the little pre-filled cups is disgraceful, so I use the my-K-cup accessory filled with Peets. Here's another parameter to consider: The Noir Family exclusively drinks Peets coffee at home, and we make it dark enough to repair blown tires. I should have known that this brewer was not going to do it for us. The device is quick and makes a hot cup. It looks great with it's blue light shining through the water reservoir but even set to dispense the tiny cup of liquid through a fully filled K-cup holder with Peets dark roast it does not make a cuppa that enables me to drive safely."
3,great machine but not durable,"We purchased this model through Amazon in April of 2008. It had normal home use. It started shorting out and not working properly after about 6 months of use. I contacted Keurig and was advised that I did not descale frequently enough (rather impolitely, I might add). Since the booklet recommends descaling every 3-6 months, and I use only filtered water, blaming me for the motor burnout seems a little unfair. They replaced the unit but with the cheaper model.The coffee is great, the tea even better, the convenience and ease of use fabulous. If they continue to honor the one year warranty I'm happy about that. I'm not really pleased about the prospect of spending a couple of hours every month heating up and smelling white vinegar as I flush my delicate little coffee machine."
2,Brews coffee WAY too hot,"You have to wait for your coffee to cool down for 20 minutes every time you use this machine because the coffee will come out as EXTREMELY hot. Also, the machine breaks too frequently, requiring maintenance way too often."
3,Overpriced and poorly designed.,"After having used this for almost 2 years and being on my 3rd replacment from Keurig, i will never buy another one of these peices of junk. I would much rather have my old 12 cup coffee pot back especially in the mornings, nothing like having to mess around with coffee for myself and my wives 2 cups before we go out the door and then our 2 travel mugs... If you only drink a little bit of coffee or want this for the other beverages on an occasional bsis, im sure it would be great...but to use this as a coffee machine,,, it doesnt last long enough or function quick enough. There is a design fault with this model, somehow the water corrodes a solenoid and the unit ceases to funciton..> Keurig knows about this and they replace the unit with not much hassle... i gave them 3 stars for customer service alone... the unit istelf would get a 1 or 2 IMHO"
4,Watery coffee,"I'm still breaking it in so I haven't tried a lot of cups. I'm noticing though for at least some, but hopefully not all of the k-cups, it's a weak brew if you go past 8 ounces. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm used to at least a 12 ounce starbucks tall. 50% less as the normal tolerable cup of coffee isn't great. If I have 2 well then the economics start to not be as compelling. I'll probably try some brands that I know have strong followings to see if it's true across the board. However, even 8 ounces is watery in this brand which I have not found to be true for others so hope is still alive."
4,Keurig B70,The product is good but I gave it as a gift. The recipient is very happy with it and the refillable Cup for Keurig.
2,fixed my Keurig,I was so frustrated because I couldn't get help for my brewer. After talking to the customer service person today I was able to get it working.
5,Keurig,"I have been on the fence about putting away my coffee maker and buying a Keurig. My son and his girlfriend rave about their Keurig B-70, so I finally broke down and purchased it! I watched the demo video and can't wait to get it!"
1,Gotta love that plastic smell w/ the AM coffee,"It's time for people to report the Keurig smell problem to the Consumer Product Safety Commision (cpsc.gov) so they will take action and check it out. 1-800-638-2772 8:00 to 5:30 EST. I tried rinsing, vinegar and it still stinks. This can't be safe to drink. When I called they said no one has reported a problem. Considering the number of complaints online it's time to report the problem. I will be returning mine and getting a stainless steel percolator from L.L. Bean but I worry about pregnant mothers and every one else. Do your part and call now or they won't look into it!"
1,Waste of Money,"i bought this for my wife for Christmas 2010 and it only worked for a couple weeks, Keurig replaced it and that one held out for almost a year, but for that kind of money i was really hoping it would last 5 or 10....."
1,Keurig Junk,"I have had my Keurig less then 2 years when the electronics went on it. I called Keurig and was told I had not descaled the machine often enough(I descaled when the machine indicated it was required) some how my lack of diligant descaling, every six months, caused the totaly seperate electronic read out to fail. Keurig ofered me a replacement peice of junk for 69 dollars, wow what a bargin, I paid over 150 dollars for the first one and it lasted all of 18 months. Thanks but no thanks, the coffee was over priced and not that good."
1,Be Prepared to Keep Replacing ...,"Purchased initial unit in February of 2011 - it stopped working about 8 months later. Keurig did replace it, but what a hassle to actually get through to them and then wait and wait on the new machine. The new machine died after 10 months, I'm not going through trying to get it replaced again, just a waste of time and money."
1,Common Mechanical Problem With These,"We purchased this unit a little over a year ago and, as Murphy's Law goes, the unit went on the brink shortly after our one-year warranty period. The machine does funny things now with the water intake. Sometimes we find it pumping water back into the reservoir instead of into our coffee cup! We rarely get a proper sized cup of coffee out of the thing, regardless of the size we select. Quick research on the internet revealed a common problem with these machines and a repair procedure. I'll have to read it in a little more detail to see if I want to mess with this or move on to a better machine. If you're thinking of purchasing this machine, check out this repair posting first: [...]"
2,I've been through 3!,"Officially done with these machines. Despite descaling as recommended, I've had 3 machines fail in the last two years. I love the coffee, but Im over it!"
5,Keurig B70 - Great model,I bought this for our office and everyone raves about it. I have a different model at home which is much noisier. This is very quiet and doesn't hum and vibrate when it pulls water from the reservoir. Might consider getting rid of the one we have at home and buying this model.
3,"Good, but could be better","Although Keurig makes a fantastic system and the best way to make coffee, this particular model, the B70 could be a lot more precise. There is not enough difference between the water output of different size cups. Why bother putting different cup sizes on the buttons. As far as being a superb machine, it is just that. Well built and well designed."
5,This machine is great!,Both my wife and I enjoy this coffee maker. The coffee is always fresh and hot. It takes seconds to make and we can each select the strength of the brew we prefer.
5,best coffee maker in 20 years,"This is the best coffee maker that I've had in 20 years. It makes good coffee better and it makes fine coffee great. It can not however make poor coffee beans taste any better, so do yourself a favor and buy the best coffee you can find and enjoy a really good cup."
3,short changed,"Bought a B70 from bed, bath and beyond in sept 2009. we make about 1-2 cups a day.It works great except every 10-12 cups, the volume is 4 oz. insteade of the 7 oz. the maker is set to. the next cup is then the right volume. I called keurig and did the requested descaling ( about 4 times in 9 months), and the paper clip cleaning. still short volume. they are sending a replacement (hopefully not refurbished). reading all the comments, i will hang onto the old one just incase the new one is a lemon. will update once we receive the new maker."
1,Keurig Model 677 coffee maker,"It was a christmas present, makes good coffee. This week stopped working. All the lights light up, the ready to brew appears, I push the button, nothings happens. I have advised customer service at Keurig and will report what happens."
4,Good Coffee Maker Bad Taste,"This is an awesome coffee maker, but there is a drawback on it. You must do a cleaning cycle in order to get that bad plastic taste out of it. I had to run about 3 gallons of water with about 1/4 of a bottle of white vinegar to remove the taste. Other than that, if it didn't have that taste after washing the tank and running it through with vinegar, I would have given it a 5 star."
4,Love this thing,"I couldn't live without my Keurig coffee maker, I just love it. I only wish that I would have gotten the one with the next bigger cup size. This a super machine that is ready in the blink of an eye. Anyone who wants a quick cup in the morning, is single, or who likes a variety of different blends, this is your machine. You should still keep a full size coffee pot on hand for parties though."
4,Should have listened!!!! (update) Not that bad.,"I didn't listen to everyones reviews or updates on this brewer. It was great.........while it lasted. 4 months later and it's dead. These brewers have a serious defect. The pumps are no where near heavy duty enough to last. We used our brewer once or twice a day and now its DEAD. For the money, they stink!!Update: 5-1-12Ok Ok. Maybe I jumped the gun a little. I think the problem was when you use K-cups at altitude, they build pressure. If you stick the cup in the holder and just close the lid, the pressure release from puncturing the top, blows coffee back up through your brewer. My wife now puts the cup in and pushes it down to puncture the bottom first. We haven't had any of the issues we had before. Brewer has been going for at least 1.5 years.BTW, those Ekobrew cups are the way to go."
1,Lasted three months,"This is my second Keurig, with the first being a the single serve model. Based on my positive experience with the single serve model, I decided to buy the high-end B-70.My Keurig B-70 only worked for three months before it would either not brew, or overflow. I had performed the maintenance ahead of schedule to prevent future problems, but that didn't help.It took a few calls to customer service to convince them that the unit was bad, but once they believed me, they replaced it quickly. The new one (less than two months old) has worked well, and I did notice a few changes between the old unit and the new unit. I'm hoping those changes fixed the problems.Funny thing is that there were no return instructions for the old unit. Seems like they don't want the defective one back.I'm disappointed that the high priced version didn't last, and I'm also glad that I kept my single serve model that has worked for years."
1,6 weeks???,"For the first 6 weeks, great coffee. Then came day 43. The machine failed. We usually have from 2-4 cups of coffee between the two of us per day. Do that math. Not that many cups brewed before failure, and now we have an elaborate paper weight. We're just beyond the amazon return limit. We'll probably eat the 20% return penalty plus shipping, rather than hassle w/manufacturer.Bottom line- great concept, terrible machine."
3,Good and bad.,"I bought the Keurig because I was tired of making a pot of coffee the old way, then having one cup, and throwing the rest out the next day. The Keurig solved that. I like the concept of single cup packets, no mess, no cleanup.I bought the B-70 (platinum) because it offered the most choice in cup sizes. I like a big cup.So far so good.Be advised that this unit is BIG. A lot bigger than my old coffee maker, but that's not a problem unless space on your counter is at a premium.My one and only complaint is the coffee is too weak. There is no menu for brewing strength. I selected the coffee that seems the boldest (Extra Bold). It's limp.Starbucks, where are you in this market? I miss my Sumatra extra bold.I know, I can buy a tiny basket to brew my own coffee, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of the Keurig?So, if you like a Starbucks bold flavor, you won't find it here."
1,"Once you've had it, you'll never go back","I finally replaced this model... Not quite two years old. I bought the B145 OfficePRO which broke in 3 weeks. If the replacement breaks, I'll move to another brand.After a good 6 months the coffee maker now frequently doesn't brew on the first try. Sometimes I need to reset it up to 5 times before i can get a cup out. I've tried cleaning it as specified countless times, and that works for about a day or so. Talking to owners of other models, they have not reported the same issue.While I love the convenience and the quality of the coffee, I can no longer recommend this model."
1,Broke in less than 6 months,"I love the Keurig, but I need a coffee maker that will last a little longer than 6 months.I woke up this morning unable to make a cup of coffee, thanks Keurig. I wish I hadn't given my old coffee maker away."
2,On my 4th Keurig,This is my 4th Keurig B70. Sounds as though I love them. Wrong. 3 stopped working within the warranty period and they were replaced by Keurig. No. 4 died this morning. It is out of warranty. The same thing happened to our daughter and son-in-law. They have had one replaced and the second one died 1 1/2 mos. after warranty. Keurig offered them a new brewer at 50% off retail. They opted to go with another brand. I am going back to a regular brewer. Good Bye Keurig. It is great while it works. Just hold your breath.
1,Could Have Been A Real Nice Coffee Maker,"The product worked well for the first 6 months. Then the pump started to act up and either not start pumping to enter the brewing process or just shut the machine down. I purchased this from a third party and not thruough Amazon, which was a big mistake. They said that they (E & B Electronics) have a 30-day warranty and thats it. I called Kuerig and they basically told me it was the water I was using. The only water that this machine has seen is RO water. Is there any better, not in a standard residential kitchen. At a price point of 200 bucks you would think someone would back their product up. DO NOT PURCHASE A KUERIG SINGLE CUP BREWING SYSTEM WHATEVER MODEL. Great idea but cheap design and parts cause it to be the worst coffee maker I have ever owned."
5,starbuck quality for a lot less,"My husband and I are avid coffee drinkers and we were a little worried about paying so much for a coffee maker, but this is the best purchase we have made thus far. Excellent coffee selection for any type of coffee drinker and the coffee maker is so easy to use and clean up is a breeze. We got the B-70 so we could use our travel mugs however if you have a tall travel mug it will not fit unless you remove the bottom drip tray."
3,Almost there....,"Almost there....In desperate need of K Cups that make espresso, cap, and latte's.Overall speed and cleanup is minimal.Produce duncan doughnut K Cups and this will be a feature everyone wants."
3,after only a month stopped working,"I bought this from Costco about a month ago. This morning it doesnt work, of course it stops at the worst possible time! I call the customer service, still bleary eyed because no coffee, the person on the line recommended that I hang up and view a video online because it was complicated. This is after he has wasted 10 minutes of my time getting all my person info. I dont know about you but I dont have a computer in my kitchen so now I have to turn on my computer and view the video. He apparently had more important things to do then to tell me how to poke a paperclip into two holes. I have had other coffee makers before and NEVER had one break within a month of purchase. I will not purchase this item again. Disappointing product quality and unimpressive customer service."
