1,Didn't get what I expected,"I ordered what I thought to be a value pack because the picture showed 4 bottles. Instead what I got was 1 tiny bottle not even shown in the picture. They wouldn't let me return it because they claim it was ""sizes it was available in"". Why would you put that as the only picture when it doesn't even include the 25ml bottle that you're actually buying? It makes me sick that I spent $5 + $4 shipping on something the size of a mini germX bottle."
2,Incomplete,"This book is interesting but seems incomplete. Toward the end of the book the author begins relating a sequence of events, then stops in the middle and explains that she doesn't know the outcome because her fieldwork ended at that time. I found this odd. I would have liked to have read more information concerning Kuru, how it changed the Fore' and (as would be the natural course of the disease if the cause (cannibalism) had in fact been removed) if there are no new instances of thedisease. The book makes the point of attaching the incidence of cannibalism to a shortage of protein in the diet of Fore' women and children. Has this protein shortage been remedied, or are the Fore' merely claiming to have given up cannibalism to appease authorities?"
3,Not worth it if you like a decent camera phone.,"Beautiful phone with beautiful functions except for the crappy delay when you take a picture with the camera function. When the flash goes off you would expect the next second to take the picture, but NO you have to literally wait at least 3 seconds before you can move or you will get an after shot that you did not expect or want."
1,sucks,the figures are the old school type that are rubber so i only have one thought it sucks. It sucks nuff said
1,Designed to waste tape,"This will print labels, but is designed to multiply the cost of tape by adding unnecessary inches to each label that you will need to trim with scisors. The cheapest black-on-white 1/2 inch tape is already very expensive at 4 to 7 cents per inch, but the final cost will be higher due to the generous padding of each label. Design is hostile to the user as it does not allow control of the length of labels."
4,Brother Personal Labeler,"The only complaint is that it is Very Difficult to change the styles of print. Good selection of print styles available, once you can get to them."
1,Wasteful and problematic,"I bought this because we have a larger more expensive model at work, that functions great all though it uses way too much label tape like the PT1830. I tried for hours to reduce the tab or margin on the labels to reduce all the unused wasted tape length. Even at the narrow setting the labels are much longer than needed and wastes the expensive label tape. After a year of very little use, because it was so difficult to punch in the text size, width, and label length, it finally stopped printing anything except the smallest text available. I wouldn't even try to garage sell this thing."
3,"Works fine, but tape is expensive","I was attracted to the many features of this label machine. When it arrived, it was larger than I expected but it had lots of features. I was dismayed to find, however, that a singe tape for this machine is almost as expensive as the machine itself!"
4,P-Touch 1830 Labeler,"I really love this labeler; it's exactly what I wanted/expected, the price was excellent, I was pleased with the timely shipping, and my only complaint is for the typical wastefulness of Brother P-Touch Labelers on tape. The tape isn't cheap, and each label cuts off a decent amount of blank tape as waste, for every label that you print. But, this I was also expecting as I'm familiar with the brand."
5,Great Product,This product works great and is easy to understand. It is very useful and easy to store. I love it!
4,My Friend's Birthday Present,"Hi, bought this for my friend and she says she loves it! I may have to buy one for myself.Have to tell you that everything I buy from Amazon is terrific so thanks again."
4,Love the PT-1830 Labeler,"I purchased this labeler for the purpose of making 'permanent' labels to identify my flower varieties in my perennial flower garden. I have used the labels on many metal plant stakes in my flower garden and have not been disapointed with them. The labels stick well to the metal and the sun has not faded the letters. I haven't had any type of malfuntion problems with either the machine or the tape. I do remember the instruction book was a bit challenging, but it has been easy to use once I figured it out. My only 'complaint' is that it does use an 'excessive' amount of tape. There is an inch of blank tape at the beginning and at the end of each label.Overall, I would buy this labeler again."
3,Overpriced because it has no AC Cord,"I bought this and returned it when I discovered that the AC cord does not come with the unit. The AC ""adaptor"" will set you back about $25.00. Too bad, because this seemed like a nice unit when I took it out of the box, with its angled keys and clean face.For $59.00, you can get a PT-1950, which has a cord and can be used with your computer USB."
2,Slight,"This book is either a heavily illustrated short story collection or a text-heavy comic. Its unusual format is its most original feature. Its plots are negligible, but its illustrations and text evoke a unique atmosphere of self-conscious nonconformism. Although its target audience is dare-to-be-different teens and college students, its interesting turns of phrase and expressive line drawings are not devoid of interest for general audences."
4,iAUDIO CW300 MP3 Player,"Very useful even with the proprietary software. great for recording lectures, memos as well as music. I've had mine for years ,using it on and off. just 1 AA battery to replace when power runs out. Even in this age of gigabytes and terrabytes, its useful and simple. I just wished it worked with my Apple computer"
5,after a long wait...,"i've been waiting to buy these for so long, and i'm glad i finally did. they look fantastic, and are SO comfortable."
1,missleading sizing information,"My girlfriend ordered me the cherry red 1914 UK 9's ""supposed to be US M 10 but received US 11 Ladies. this was a xmas present and they have to be sent back because they are NOT mens and THEY do not FIT. they are truely a womans boot a man cannot not wear them. when you click on the black they are correct but the red are not. i am very disappointed and will be sending them back and ordering a pair on the Dr. Martain Website"
2,Disappointing,"I was excited to order these beautiful Doc Martens boots thinking that this old established brand was making a fine product. Instead, I paid $120 for boots with unfinished, non-lined leather that rubs off on my socks, a small unfinished, non-lined tongue that slips to one side and also rubs off on my socks, and though adequately sized, lack padding and hurt my toes and are simply not comfortable. They certainly look and sound good in your marketing material, though."
3,Nice boots for people with smaller calves,"These boots are nice- They look sharp (the color is really closer to Oxblood, not clown red as the picture might appear), and have a very comfortable sole. That said, there are some things to consider-*In case you dont know, Dr. Martens shoe sizing runs a little big. If you wear between a 12.5 and 13, go for the UK 11. This is contrary to what is suggested by Amazon (half sizes use next higher size). Width was generous (I have a wide foot, and these seemed to fit fine.)*Calf fit may be a problem. I have 19.5"" calves, and there was no way I could get the boots closed. As a result I had to return the boots. :(*These boots are not the UK made docs. Some people like the UK ones better, others don't care.*Remember boots take some breaking in time- This is true of all boots. They should not be uncomfortable when you first get them, but they will feel better after a couple months of wear."
2,WISH THEY FIT MY FEEEET!!!,"Love this style and LOVE these boots!!! But I normally wear 7.5 US sized womens shoes and ordered 6UK/39EU/8US and they were a size too big but WAY too tight around my foot. PLUS stiff as a BOARD!!! I read that it was really hard to get them worn in, but OMG! Guess I will have to find my perfect Docs in a store where I can try them on and make sure its not going to take the rest of my life to wear them in... Very disappointed that these didn't work out for me :("
4,AWESOME !!!!,I love these boots .... you do have to break them in but after that awesome ...great price also.
4,perfect!,"I saw these on sale in the spring, and couldn't pass up the 60.00 price. I know i'll wear them tons during the fall and winter because doc martens are my go-to shoe for those seasons. Super comfortable, the only issue is that you have to lace them up each time you put them on because they don't have a zipper on the side."
3,A little bit too hard,"I bought this item seeking for comfort and strong look. The strong look I got it, but It was too strong that it even hurt my feet way too much. In 3 weeks I've only used them 2 times because the first time I got bruised in the ankle and burned badly. I put on some heavy socks and even with that I couldn't stand it. The material it's made of, it's too hard on food and it doesn't even have a cover to diminish the contact on the skin. This boots I love for the looks but I think it's very, very uncomfortable. I recommend people another type of boot that it's softer on the skin."
5,Very comfortable,"These are very comfortable boots when they fit right. I made the mistake of going one size down rather than a size up. I normally wear an 8 (US) but everyone was saying how you have to order a smaller size so I ordered a size 7(US). I ended up taking the boots to a shoe repair shop and having them custom stretched to fit my feet. So now they fit right and I have no discomfort wearing them all day. I just make sure to wear good quality boot socks with them and even if I have to run in them, my feet don't hurt at all. Keep in mind, that these boots run a little narrower than normal boots due to the stitching on the side. It would be good idea to check your shoe size before buying these to make sure you get the right size and width. Other than that these are the most comfortable boots I have worn since a pair of Wolverine Cowboy boots that I owned and wore many years ago."
4,Sick'ning Pumps,"Within an hour of putting this boot on for the first time, I received three compliments from random people on the streets of San Francisco. So, I think I made a good choice in snatching a pair. I only wish it was available with 20 eyes.10/26/2012I don't wear `em often, but they rock sock and are complimented every time I do."
4,"Not perfect, but really good applications","I've studied Wing Chun for years, and do agree that this CD strays in some places from the traditional approach. However, I also caution that many Wing Chun practitioners are so tradition / lineage oriented that they miss some really great approaches to the style out of shear ignorance. They think if it is different than they do it, it must be wrong. Well, not necessarily so. As far as this CD goes, it may not be the best instructional tool for a beginner, but I think it should accompany anyone's collection simply because the applications presented for the moves of the Sil Lum Tao form are VERY ADVANCED! You don't often see such advanced applications even in advanced Wing Chun classes, because most people don't know a lot of the ones shown here. Anyway, enough said. I'd buy it if you study or want to study wing Chun."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was appalled at the poor quality and poor instruction on this cd! All it shows is a few different techniques from several angles. Unfortunately the technique execution is horrible and completely goes against most principles of wing chun. The presenter obviously has some backround in shoalin kung fu, but next to none in wing chun. If you want some good instruction, I suggest any video from Emin Boztepe and the American Wing Tsun Organization."
1,The Worst,Please...Please...Please...Don't waste your money. This CD-Rom has nothing to do with wing chun. Terrible.
1,Don't waste your money on this ...!,"Save your money. This CD is a worthwhile idea, and was put together well. But, the problem is the wing chun practicioner. He doesn't know wing chun at all. The first form is all wrong. It's obvious he learned wing chun from a cracker jack box. Save your money! Go pick up an Augustine Fong video if you want to see what wing chun is supposed to look like. Sorry if I offended anyone, but the wing chun in the video is garbage.-Lorenzo"
5,amazing,"not only are they an awesome group of guys, but this is some of the best acoustic rock i have ever heard....you must check them out...the only thing better than the cd is checking out the live show!!!"
5,Spanish for OB/GYN Clinics,"The first chapter introduces the reader to the Spanish alphabet, so that the reader may learn how to pronounce Spanish words, and to some basic expressions such as common greeting phrases like ""Good morning"" and ""How are you?""In subsequent chapters the reader learns the names for the parts of the body, phrases for admission into a hospital and phrases for a pregnancy to name a few.Overall I consider his method to be excellent. I enjoyed the DVDs at home and followed the CDs while driving to work, a real great Spanish learning experience.I will recommend this course to everyone."
2,"Spanish for OB / GYN Clinics - Digital Multimedia Course: 2 books, 4 Audio CDs and 2 DVDs","It is useful, but not worth the price. The content does not reflect current OB/GYN practice. DVD are not helpful. It is just only 2 speakers reading course books on the screen. I mostly listen to the CD on the way to work.[[ASIN:0975855034 Spanish for OB / GYN Clinics - Digital Multimedia Course: 2 books, 4 Audio CDs and 2 DVDs]"
5,GE 15839 L40/W Lumiline 40W Incandescent Bulb,I purchased two GE 15839 L40/W Lumiline 40W Incandescent Bulbs. The product arrived in a timely fashion and the experience was great. I would do business with this vendor again.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book because I very much like Susan Estrich's advocacy, and hoped that she'd convince me that Hillary isn't a liar unworthy of the office. Susan failed. This book is one big dodge - an apology for a person I feared was, and now know is, a liar. If she is the nominee, I won't be able to bring myself to vote for her. I'm just sick thinking about it. I don't want another 4 years of a Republican administration, but my conscience won't allow me to vote for Hillary."
1,hurts to read,"I swear, you've never seen so much manuevering in your life. Page after page, Estrich covers Hillary's butt in increasingly implausible ways. It all gets to a point where one only laughs at the lengths to which some people will go to elect this woman. The Case FOR Hillary Clinton? There isn't one."
2,An Embarrassing Brief for Hillary Clinton,"Susan Estrich's argument for a Hillary Clinton Presidency seems to be divided into three parts. (A) She can win. (B) All those mean things people have been saying about her are lies. (C) If Hillary doesn't win, women are in for a world of hurt. There is nothing here that will convert anyone who is not already predisposed to support a Clinton Restoration. It reads like a lawyer's brief with inconvenient facts left out or glossed over. Still, it does provide a window into the mind of a Clintonista who clearly has been champing at the bit to get back into power after eight years of the Bush Terror. Sad, in a way. Horrifying when one thinks about the number of people who will buy the argument without criticism."
1,this book is awful,"The people who've been giving this book 5 stars are nuts. This book is simply awful. One suspects, honestly, that the 5 star ratings are a fraud perpetrated by a single person. The person who rated it one star had it dead on. This book is propaganda."
5,nightmare scenario,"i'm reading this book and i think everyone else should if for no other reason but to understand how close we are to seeing this socialist elected to the presidency and how important it is that conservatives not be lulled into thinking that it can't happen. personally, i am dreaming of 'condi' running for president. she is a world class diplomat. pianist. and figure skater. she has gotten to where she is on her own and not on the coattails of a husband. she is beautiful, honest and intelligent. and i want to see hillary lose, and lose badly. sweet."
1,disingenuous at best,"The effort to characterize hillary as something less alarming than a severely radical leftist has begun - a critical effort if she is to have any chance at all of becoming President. This is to say, a massive whitewash is underway to convince Americans that she wouldn't absolutely destroy their lives. Obviously, this effort will persuade quite a number of people; to put it charitably, it's been quite a while since the average American could be described as a critical thinker.So, this book is the first salvo in what will almost certainly emerge as the most significant political campaign in modern American history. It's a masterful piece of propaganda, and reads well - as one might expect from a writer as talented as Ms. Estrich. But it is propaganda nonetheless. If you are (1) open-minded, and (2) motivated to some degree by gender, then please consider the rational alternative - Condoleeza Rice (honestly, the open-minded part is sufficient...)."
1,STUPID,"Stupid review of a woman (Hillary) who has allowed women's rights to be lowered, so much for Chelsea and her future."
5,Estrich makes her case well,"If I ever had any doubts about supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton for President, this book dispelled any such notions. When I first read the book over a year ago, I was impressed with the manner in which Estrich 'makes the case' for Hillary's superior intellect making her a great choice. Now that I have heard so many say that when watching the debates they notice that Hillary appears to be the smartest of the Democratic candidates, I am reminded of Estrich's book. I bought five extra copies to give to friends!"
4,Good history lesson,This is especially brought to home for us because some of our familyare included in the making of it.So very interesting!
5,Great blade,"Put this blade on a Bosch miter saw, and have been using to cut Bruce engineered flooring at 90 and 45 degrees. Fast, smooth cuts!"
5,AMAZING!,"The Realm of the Wild is an amazing collection of wildlife photography!!! I love wildlife, photography & Kenya! This book portrays the amazing creations of our awesome God & Creator!!! Thanks so much Michel & Christine for bringing these photos to us!!!!"
4,"Good book, but only for french defence starters","Im aware that very recently, and especially throughout this year (2006) there would be published really a bunch of the new french books. Added to existing Psakhis 4 volume series, would be Pedersens new works which would also close its series, and there would be Sam Collins French Advance, which to me at least tell that Everyman too would like to close its series in near future. All in all, there is all of a sudden a lot of material for advanced player.But, there are almost none for beginner. So this book is trying to accomplish that goal. Well, it succeded, but partially. As the previous rewiers noted, the lines are not perfect in every variation, but honestly, I think that is no of much significance for starters. What is more important is feeling for playing french u can catch with this book because author really explained the particularies and plans nicely.Recommended for beginers in french, best followed by Play the french from Watson."
1,very poor,"Some of the other ""Starting out"" books have a lot of ideas, theory and reasons for the first 10-12 moves, which I find very user friendly. This one has almost none of that, just some annotated games. It's more for beginners of chess."
2,Not quite what I was looking for,"The quality of pictures are great. Dont get me wrong. It's the style of poses that has me trying to sell my extra copy. I wanted a monthly viewing of fine men but not in this manner. The poses are more for the views of another man. Not woman. Plus a lot of the men are not at all enticing. But, the quality of photography was nice. I just purchased the wrong type of calendar"
2,D&D's mom,"I have to be vigilant when my 2-year-old uses the Thermos because if he places the cannister on its side, milk will come out of the straw. He also likes to turn it upside down, and milk comes out. I bought two of them only two weeks ago, and one broke today when it fell out of his bag. The cover cracked and the hinge broke off. As a result, the cap will not stay on now. I am looking for other alternatives. Glass is out of the question with my boys!"
2,"Might not leak if you have very neat, careful children. Sharp lid can be dangerous.","I bought two of these cups, excited that they were stainless steel sippies priced less than Safe Sippy and some others. Besides, I'd read that many of those had problems with leaking.Unfortunately, the Foogo leaks as well. As another reviewer put it, it's more of a steady stream. It doesn't seem to leak when the lid is closed, but when open, if the cup is turned on its side or upside down, the liquid just pours right out of the air valve. Ridiculous. My daughter just turned the cup over and enjoyed 'drawing' with the milk that came out in a steady stream.I returned the cups immediately.More worrisome is the fact that several reviewers mention their children getting hurt, one needing ten stitches, from either being pinched by the lid mechanism or cut by the sharp edge of the lid. I feel like I should point this out since it's not mentioned in the most helpful critical review."
4,lunch thermos,"The Foogo is very convenient for my daughter w/special needs who takes a lunch to school each day. We've had one for at least a year and then purchased a second one. No leaks, easily portable and she can drink out of it easily. The best part is that there is no BPAs. Only downside is that it's hard to reach the bottom for cleaning. May have to invest in a special brush. But it's still easier to clean than many other BPA-free bottles which have small openings at the top. It's also reasonably priced.Foogo by Thermos Leak-Proof SS 12 oz Straw Bottle in Blue"
2,"Yes, it does leak","I bought what will probably be my one and only Foogo Thermos in December, replacing an older-model Thermos Funtainer. The lid latch on the old Funtainer cracked off, causing a milk flood in my daughter's lunch box one day.Now, the new Foogo is leaking, and I've tried both the original and replacement straws. I can see what's wrong: Tighten the lid to avoid leakage at the rim, and the straw unit twists ever so slightly, creating a tiny gap where the straw pops through the lid. We've had multiple floods in my daughter's lunch box, and my email to the company last week so far has gone unanswered.We're now using an older plastic Thermos that a) doesn't keep liquids as cool and b) hogs lunch box space. But at least it hasn't leaked. I consider Thermos a quality label. But this design hasn't measured up."
1,very smelly,i purchased one of these for my son today and the chemical smell it has is just awful. i washed it and aired it out but it is still there. it is going back to target asap! i also bought a funtainer straw bottle made by thermos for my daughter and it doesn't smell funny and seems to be basically the same idea.
2,This has a major flaw for kids! The flip lid breaks easily!,"We have had three of these. Two of them have had their flip lids snapped and cracked when my son or daughter dropped them--and kids drop things! The lid is just a very brittle plastic and with a hinge that makes it very vulnerable in a fall. I've temporarily fixed them with superglue but it eventually cracks again. While thermos makes great adult products, a heavy stainless steel can is a lot for a kid. So otherwise its a beautiful mug, but gets very expensive as it breaks and drops. Thermos need to modify this and avoid a design with this brittle flip lid."
1,Junk -- Disintegrated after 2 mos,"At first, I was super excited about this product. It keeps milk cold for 8 hrs, so it's so much easier to hand to your child and not stress about how long it's been out.BUT . . . the straw disintegrated under my son's teeth. When I called Thermos, they told me too bad, and then they said that they don't warranty the straw or the valve. When I asked for the woman's name, she transferred me to a voicemail and hung up.So, also terrible customer service. Beware."
2,Beware of cracking plastic!,"I was happy to find a BPA-free sippy cup with a straw (this was the only I could find) because our speech therapist suggested a straw sippy. They worked great for about a month, but they're not very toddler proof. My son dropped them a couple of times and the ring of plastic around the bottom started to crack. The plastic comes off in sharp small pieces that would NOT be good for him to eat (fortunately he's not sticking everything in his mouth anymore.) It also leaves pretty sharp pieces sticking out. Unfortunately, you can't just pull the plastic piece off because it's glued on."
1,Junk,"I bought two (pink and blue). Both leak. I thought this would be the greatest thing since is was BPA free and cold keep drinks cold. I like the sippy cup by the same company but my daughter has graduated to the straw types. It started leaking from day one. After washing it, I would spend 5 minutes trying to align the vent hole different ways to prevent leaking. It was also dropped from about 2 feet and the hinge broke. No way to fix that so basically it now has no lid. I have emailed the company with no response and don't plan on sitting on hold for 20 minutes like others have. I wish I could take it back. I am going back to Nalgene and Camelbak BPA free. Save your money."
2,NOT LEAK PROOF!!,"We purchased the thermos and sippy cup at the same time. I really wanted to like both items, but they leak way too much. The thermos fell over on it's side the other day (noone noticed) and it made a huge puddle on the floor. It does do a great job at keeping liquids cold and my daughter loves the easy push button top (took her only 1-2 tries to figure it out). But, Thermos needs to do a better job on the leaking issue especially if they are claiming it's leak proof."
2,At first it was great. but didn't stand up to the test of time.,"I loved this thermos at first... but after several months the bottom plastic piece popped off. For the price, I would expect this to last longer. I've used the ""throw-away"" cups with straws for longer than this with no problems."
3,Better than others,"Have tried a couple other straw type cups and what I like better about this one is it doesn't allow the pressure inside to push the drink back out through the straw when it's sitting idle. Convenient for outings since it stays cold much longer than other insulated types and the lid is empowering for my 2yr old who likes to control whether it's open or closed. I also think he's more drawn to it because it's rather adult-like, but the drawbacks are true re: getting replacement straws are not convenient, the straw inside will unattach (we noticed it happens when the thermos gets dropped), but we just unscrew and reattach. There is leakage from the straw if turned upside down or thrown down with the lid open but I haven't found a straw cup that doesn't do this, so I need to determine what the next important thing for me and it's that it didn't puddle up while sitting on the floor. I do want to get more of these because they do to work for our child better than the ohers we tried."
5,Best Bisphenol-A free straw sippy cup,"When I found out that our favorite Nuby straw sippy cups were leaching chemicals, I went on a hunt to find the best Bisphenol-A free straw sippy cup to replace our beloved Nuby ones. We tried cups by Sassy, Munchkin, Sigg, and the Foogo Thermos cup. The Foogo Thermos cup was overall the best cup. It doesn't leek, my toddler loves opening and closing it, it comes in pink (which she loves), and it holds the same fluid ounces as the Nuby."
3,"Great thought, not practical","We purchased this item last month for our daughter to use at school. The plastic straw has already broken off and she dropped the bottle once and the lid cracked in half. We understand that these things happen, but we also expect a little more from an established company like Thermos. Called customer service and no parts available. They are still waiting. I'm sure it's a long trip from China. The idea is great. Keeps liquid cold. Doesn't seem to be made to last. You will probably end up paying a lot for parts and it will end up in a garage sale next year."
3,It does leak,"First off, this bottle does leak. It is very frustrating that there is a tiny air hole in the plastic straw insert, so when the child tilts the bottle over liquid pours out in a steady stream. My son is 18 months old and still doesn't grasp the concept of not tilting the bottle, so I hate giving him this bottle. The only good thing about it is that it keeps liquids cold."
3,Breaks easy!,I loved this cup until my son dropped it getting it off the counter and the lid broke to peices! My son throws $3.00 cups all over the place but the $15.00 cup breaks to peices when dropped once. It has also never been leak proof. We normally only use it to go out because it leaks so bad I don't want it to leak all over the house. I love that it keeps drinks cool for hours but it leaks bad and is not worth the money to have it break so easy. Very disappointed!
3,Good musicans but very bad quality video,"My admiration to Tito's performing never change, iven watching this poor quality DVD, it look like was taking with a home videocamera."
5,A Good Rockin' Blues Album,"I'm always impressed with Mason Ruffner's music, and this album did not let me down. It has a good rockin' blues vibe throughout. All thirteen songs are great. I'm sure that when I listen to this album twenty, thirty years from now, I'll still say that this album and this music sound pretty damn good! Keep 'em coming Mason Ruffner."
5,Better and Better She Gets...,"... but less and less like Jane Austen. So? Who cares? Well, the Austen purists do, but they probably quit reading the series long ago. Yep, Jane is behaving downright unnaturally for a true Regency spinster--isn't it fun? The endless reflection and ratiocination of the earlier books is replaced with more action in the recent books, and I for one consider the change an improvement. This is my favorite book so far; when I read Netley, that will undoubtedly become my new favorite. Read Jane Austen if you want to read Jane Austen; read this series if you enjoy good mysteries with interesting characters and well-researched local/historical color."
2,Much too serious to be interesting,"Stephanie Barron has obviously done her homework; after reading biographies of Jane Austen, I believe Ms. Barron has represented the real Jane Austen quite well. However, the book is far too serious and therefore VERY BORING. I only got to the end of this book because it was the recorded version. Reading it would have taken far too much energy."
4,Blunt is cool,"This book I liked due to the sun sign interpretations of sexual response and psychological action. I resonated with my sun sign needs and actions. I thought it was a little dark in some parts of the interpretations. I wish the author could have taken me deeper into the their interpretations by including the rising sign, Venus, Mars and maybe the Moon on sexual needs, as you should take into account all of these planets. I think that with the darker parts of interpretation their are some psychological dispositions that all sun signs need to overcome in order to experience ""right"" expression. I would have liked to have had that spelled out a little more clearly.Sassy, blunt, and introspective. I would say cool to have on your shelf."
1,"Contrived, Not Well Written - Pretentious","I found this book not well written. It seemed to skip all over the place and had no real journey. Didn't have much luck with the kids at school either - seemed to bore easily. Should re-think ""writing"" in the future. Want a refund."
2,Basically Unimaginative,"Yes, this book to me just seemed unimaginative, and I found the price expensive for the value. I shared it with a young kindergarten teacher I know; she had never heard of the Wiley book and thought the same thing.Obviously, this is not the one essential book to take to you desert island with your kids, but I find it useful as the pictures were cute. As a parent/teacher/librarian, the kids seemed to enjoy the pictures more than the story. The illustrations were great. Overall, would not recommend."
3,Hit and Miss,"McGrath offers an uneven take on contemporary American culture through this eclectic selection of poems. Flashes of brilliance emerge, but often feel bogged down in cleverness. His cynicism spans the spectrum from incisive to caustic, and sometimes the impact of the message dissolves due to the acid edge. Infinite Needs is a favorite, and it makes me think that 100 years from now readers might discover a window into the early 21st century by reading McGrath. The good here is very good; but many left me cold."
5,Very cool!,Very cool and very rare documentary from the '70's. Highlights is the great footage of both Benny Urquidez and Japanese kickboxing legend Toshio Fujiwara. Old school Puroresu fans will dig the great footage of Antonio Inoki and the behind the scenes training at the old New Japan Dojo. Fans of this documentary would also enjoy Fighting Black Kings- a Kyokushin Kai Karate documentary made by what appears to be the same people.
1,"NOT A CS500, it's a CS550 and it doesn't work as well","Don't buy this item if you're looking for a CS500. CS500s work very well, but I was shipped a CS550 and it doesn't work at ALL."
2,Barely worth the money,"I've had this identical model for several years, and I've never really felt that it did me any good. Though I dial up or down the frequency setting, at best I get two, three, or more false readings in any breaker box. Thus, the trek back and forth to determine if I've cut the power to the correct breaker is frustrating."
4,"works, but takes some tweaking","This breaker finder works, but it takes a bit more tweaking than whats mentioned in the manual. I had to adjust the setting up/down until the finder beeped over just one breaker.Considering the price, this would be OK for occasional use, but something better may be better for professional use."
2,It works after you check several breakers.,I have had this unit for a few years and have never been able to trust it. The receiver picks up a lot of false (I think) signals. I went to the panel and checked several wires and got readings on a few. I tried adjusting the sensitivity and still got the readings. The same thing happened at the breakers.I would not want to bet my life on it.
5,Does what is says,"I purchased this at a local store because the price was right, and I had a gift card. I was skeptical after reading the reviews here. I went to my basement, FOLLOWED the directions, and it worked PERFECTLY!! As I have read other reviews of this and other similar products, I think some are not understanding the calibration step.I have a job coming up that is in a larger building/service panel than my house and will update the results after I have used it there."
1,utterly absurd,"The plug-in part does not have a battery and sends a signal only if the power is on. So you can track a good wire and a good working fuse. But if the fuse is out the power to the outlet is off, there is no signal in the wire so you cannot track it or find the bad fuse. Catch 22. Completey defies the purpose as most people search for faulty fuses when there is a failure. Absolutely idiotic."
3,Not as good as the origional,"This product was purchased because I misplaced the plug-in portion of an older model. But, simply put this does not work as accurately as the original product worked...it is too vague for my tastes."
5,Origami All Grown-Up,"A wonderful way to view the art and science of origami. To watch and listen to both the creative and scientific discussions around the idea of a ""fold"" was delightful. Whether watching the medium being transformed, to illustrate complex mathematics, showcases real-world applications in space and the potential for designing drugs that intelligently attack disease while protecting the host is both mind-bending and entertaining. Dirk Spencer, Creator of Resume Psychology, Corporate Recruiter."
4,I couldn't stop folding my netbook after I watched this!!,"I wasn't convinced by the other reviews that I would enjoy this movie, I mean its about folding paper?! But after about ten minutes I was looking around for something to fold! I doubt I'll take up folding as a hobby but just to see what some of these people have created is worth the watch."
5,Ended too soon!,Very much enjoyed this short and fascinating film. The time spent looking at both the art and the science (and how the two are connected) was consistently fun and informative. I was definitely sad when the film ended; would have loved to see more!
1,The Narration ruins this movie,"Terrible terrible terrible breathy weird narration. Made me feel stabby within the first spoken sentence. If only she had spoken with normal cadence. I did manage to watch the whole thing somehow, and the last two artists/scientists were worth the wait. Turn the sound off maybe?"
5,plea for learning by doing and doing while learning,"This film brilliantly illustrates one of those instances when play intersects beauty and utility. This can be done by eluding formalism (ranging from topology to origami), or not. In the former case, one ought to follow inspirational heuristics. It's a showcase for the 'no-limits' nature of human mind and creativity.The takeaway? Outside the obvious surface folding domains/applications, this film ought to stimulate our quest for improvement in a lot of other directions. As well, the human being is so much better at getting from A to B in so many ways rather than explaining the process. It's a plea for learning by doing and doing while learning; very inspirational indeed!___________As a footnote, I would play this film in many a board room/academic environment where knowledge comes scripted at best. At least, the folks in the latter setting have also Paul Feyerabend."
5,So very Interesting,If you love paper and art and the process of how things are done you will love this documentary.Who knew the science of all that is involved in the simple folding of paper?Very neat. Very beautiful.Inspiring.
5,folding as an art and a scientific experience,"Who knew that origami was a scientific art?I first saw parts of this video at the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, L.A., CA. Then I saw it on PBS. The video is a piece of art. It shows how scientific applications (The airbags in your car uses origami) can double your enjoyment and fascination of origami. I encourage all to go to see the exhibit at the JANMuseum, the exhibit has mainly artistic applications.Latch on to this video as a souvenir, even if you don't go to see the exhibit."
4,Unfold a new world,"Remember those little colored squares of the thin Japanese paper from elementary school? Well this DVD unveils a world of origami which I never knew existed, and has nothing to do with the art class you remember from school. This isn't watching some old woman fold paper cranes, but people of all ages and shapes creating ""sculptures"" out of paper. The DVD does a great job of categorizing the different schools of thought in the world of origami, and gives you an insight into all of them. From the traditionalists to the rogues, and everything in between. Some create intricate and accurate living creatures, some are intricate and hard to grasp geometric inventions which also live and breath. There is even a segment about a man using only one fold to produce incredibly interesting creations. If you enjoy visual stimulation through art and exhibitions of intense skill, this documentary is for you."
5,Required reading,"Pastor Gray's book is a thought-provoking, scripturally sound and practical guide for all who are seeking a genuine, life-changing move of God in their church. It takes the guesswork out of preparing hearts and congregations for revival. Should be required reading for all pastors and church leaders!"
1,When The Kingdom Comes,"This was not a very good book at all. What a pompous, arrogant man this Steve Gray must be. Accounts given are not credible or believable. His supposed facts just do no line up. Not worth $1.29, much less $12.99. I give it one star for the pretty colors on the cover."
5,Initial disappointment turned into a great discovery,I was disappointed at first because I couldn't find more than a verse or two with B-Legit in it. I found that Q-Z and Baby S are two of the best MCs that I have heard in years. I definitly recomend that you buy this cd not for B-Legit but for Q-Z and Baby S.
1,A rip-off,"B-Legit is only on about 90 seconds max of this cd, A HUGE rip-off. The tunes are boring. Why would he associate himself with such garbage??"
1,"""Not Legit!!""",This is not B-Legit's album. It goes to show you how the industry will try to pimp great artists.
1,A Poor Leader's Spin,"The author is very adept at pointing her fingers of blame. But since she WAS a General Officer at the time, there is no excuse. This book is simply a spin of ""passing the buck"" and uninformed civilians buy it, hook, line and sinker. I am infuriated at her actions throughout the book. Simply she should have not been promoted and placed in this capacity. A sad comment that one who served in the military knows...""There are no bad troops, only bad leaders."" Karpinski fits this mold and this book does her no justice as the truth was pointed out in the Army's investigation. NO EXCUSE for her poor leadership. Don't buy her spin/lie."
4,First Pilates Cd,Got it unexpectedly fast. I'm a happy camper I can get started this weekend no excuses. I didn't think it would be mailed to me in 2 days
2,too easy,"I was so looking forward to an intense workout. When I put the DVD in and began the workout I was barely begining to work up a small glisten when it ended. The work out was too easy, too short, and not worth 25 bucks. Pilate s for Dummies was more challenging. Save your money."
4,Difficult but worth it!!,"I would recommend this to beginners and die hard Pilates fans alike. To the beginners I would say: ""Yes its tough, but breath through it. Its completely worth the pain lol."" If your just looking to strengthen your tummy muscles this is the workout for you, it tones, and stretches, and has great long term pain relief that I was not expecting. If you just had a c-section I would definitely let it heal before you begin this workout, but as soon as you can, this workout will get your stomach muscles working in top condition. I recommend this to anyone,and everyone."
3,Haven't I seen these moves before?,"The video is pretty good. I feel the burn afterwards and I definitely break a sweat. However, I was a little disappointed to see all the same moves from the 'Accelerated Body Sculpting' Windsor pilates dvd. I may have counted 3-4 new moves in this 20 min. video. I did notice that doing them all together instead of spread out made my abs burn more, but I was excited for something new!"
5,Great Post-Baby Workout,"I had a child about 14 months ago. I had lost all the baby weight but still felt heavy in my mid-section. Within weeks of doing this workout 3x per week I noticed a difference. Within a few months of combining this DVD with a couple other workouts every week, I not only felt my mid-section was back to it's ""'pre-baby"" appearance but that it was better than it's been in a long time."
3,Ok but was expecting more,"The image makes the umbrella look better and the description says its bigger. If I would have known this, maybe I would have reconsider in buying it."
3,computer based strategy game,"I like these kind of games but, I have had this one for a couple of months and find it hard to navigate. There are alot of ""code keys"" (single letters to click on to make troops swing into action) that keeps me using the mouse and key board alot. I am playing in medium difficulty and I have a hard time getting enough troops to survive the front lines to conquer the bases in the rear. But, maybe I need more time. Example: having only foot troops agianst tanks makes it hard to survive. I guess it is a challenge because I keep playing it."
2,Shoddy piece that passes as a vacuum,The piece is basically a brush that collects all the hair on its bristles. I would say the brush is worth 2$ and that is all the product should be sold for. The electrical part of it is totally useless. There is the dirty job of removing hte hair from the bristles to clean. Very icky. Don't buy this.
3,shelster,This is ...well o.k.....I would not buy it again.....it seems akward to use....the pick-up is so..so.
1,Euro-Pro Shark V1705 Cordless Mini Hand Junk,"I bought this one, it barely works. Even after 48 hours charge, the roller stops dead on carpeting, doesn't have enough torque even to barely work on a bare floor. Plus the handle is awkward. Don't buy it."
5,loved it!!!,"this book is so amazing i absolutely loved it! if you ever get the chance to, read this book! its definately worth your time!!!"
1,Unbelievably Homophobic,"For a book written only 11 years ago, the homophobia in it is just astounding. Anti-gay slurs abound from the mouths of the characters, who, of course, are creations of the author. The most evil man in the novel, a Nazi-like police chief, is a closet case with a predilection for pretty young men. The author created that character too. When another character uses racist words, he is taken to task. Nothing of the sort happens to anyone who uses anti-gay slurs and one can only conclude that the author wanted it that way. I cannot recommend this piece of trash to anyone. I looked at the author's blog, where he very unconvincingly denies being a homophobe, but quit seeing a doctor who he thought might be interested in him without even finding out if he was right. But, the doctor was a proctologist, and I wonder if he saw something in the author and decided to take a hike on his own."
5,The Last City Room,"The finest novel written this year. Strong statement? No doubt. When a writer of Mr. Martinez's quality opens up his cache of visual images with understated elegance, you know you're reading something very special. Didn't live during the 60's or can't remember them? Forget it. The story, the characterization, the plotting, and those lovely Martinez words will take you on a voyouristic journey of one man's attempt to understand the world around him and avoid self-destruction."
4,Good overview,It lacked a thorough APA style results section tutorial which wold have been immensely useful. It also didnt provide a very good discussion of synonyms for various terms used by other books.
4,Waylon....the definitive Outlaw!!,"I was never too consumed by the conglomerate Outlaw concept for marketing purposes..Waylon Jenning ..is the consumate Outlaw's Outlaw..he stands on his own merit as a true renegade..I met him and Jessi backstage at the Cannery in Nashville, TN in 1985, where they were performing. I remember Jessi constantly worrying Waylon about eating some food other than sweets. Waylon finally turned to her and said ""I have eaten so much now, I can't breathe""....Jessi then chided him into another piece of Pecan Pie..This video is Waylon at his best...not all his songs, but a very good mix, and well worth the money"
5,Waylon dvd,"Without a doubt this is one of his best ever. Waylon was a top performer and will always be #1. All of the songs are great. I wasn't sure what songs were on it, but I am not disappointed. I don't think it matters what he sings, he can make any song the best you have ever heard. I ordered this on July 9th and received it on July 12th. The seller is great."
1,Incredible but true!,"This garbage is even worse than the film was, which, if you've seen it, seemed to be impossible. Save your money and your mind!"
4,A fascinating account of a little known conflict.,"If the history, ground, tactics and personalities of a distant conflict interest you, then you'll really enjoy this book. John Akehurst commanded an independant brigade of Omani and Baluch troops in a tough but successful campaign against Communist rebels in Dhofar in Southern Oman. Together with the larger picture is a wealth of detail which brings the account to life. One such being when the Brigadier and his wife were shot down in their helicopter while visiting British officers in isolated forward positions one Christmas day. This conflict is almost unknown, but it's successful outcome laid the foundation for the peace and stability of the Gulf nations."
4,Son loves it!,"At Christmas we got this for Seth, my 11-year old son, and he loves the shirt. The huge number of Marvel characters seems to be a center of discussion when he wears it. He knows them all and always goes around ""testing"" people to see how many of these comic book heroes they know. It is already fading some though, with the front colors getting duller sooner than I think they should. Having said that, he wears it so much that maybe it's just so much wearing it and laundrying between that has seemed to fade the colors a little quicker than they should."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen....,"This movie was so bad that I got up and left the theatre before it was over. To call this movie boring would be an insult to boring movies. So many talented actors, so little entertainment. Please don't waste your time on this one. You'll probably come out better watching paint dry. Believe me, that would be far more entertaining."
3,The Cookout (Widescreen Edition),"When Todd Anderson signs a $30 million deal with his hometown team, the New Jersey Nets, he knows that his life is set for a big change. To keep things real, he decides to throw a barbeque at his place just like the ones his family used to have. But when you have new and old friends, family, agents, and product reps in the same house, things are bound to get crazy. This movie had a good message about being responsible and down to earth even after hitting pay dirt. The Cookout is a ok movie, if you take if for what it is."
1,A BURNT COOKOUT,"THE COOKOUT WAS ONE OF THE WEAKEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN.PERIOD.AND DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE,IT PROBABLY STINKS AT HOME JUST LIKE AT THE MOVIES."
3,Cookout Chaos...............................................,"Originally I said I wouldn't buy this movie. BECAUSE we all know too well that too many African American's in one low budget film is pure and simple HELL!Now although I didn't HATE this movie, it's far from great. YET it has quality meanings.1st round pick in the NBA Todd Anderson tries to maintain his ""ghetto badge"" while popping a new Range, a Jacob, and of all things bricks in a ritzy gated suburb.As Todd's mom, Lady M,(Jennifer Lewis)tries to warn him about ""his"" money. She soon discovers that it's somewhat too late. With a gold digger on the loose she has to pull out the swiftness to keep up with Brittany (Meagan Good) who's eyes sparkle like DIAMONDS!Todd has spent more than he can chew. So now he needs to sell himself out for endorsements in order to stay afloat. Can he get what he needs with family all up in there?Ya'll know my saying support ya people!I did laugh some. I liked the cast even though it was ""sterotypical"""
1,"Awful script, wasted cast",Another talented cast wasted on awful writing. Queen Latifah's appearance made this movie bearable to watch.
4,very good,i saw this movie in the theaters before. and i must say that this was one of the best comedies ive seen in years.
2,More like a washed out cookout...,"this movie was far from funny...the jokes were corny and predictable, many scenes were stereotypical and played out. The was a good storyline and the writer could've done much better with it than resort to the corny jokes and stereotypes. Stay away from this movie at all costs...don't pay for it or rent it...catch it on cable like I did. Now I know why this tanked at the movies..."
1,Supreme Letdown,"DO NOT put this as one of the top Black movies. It evokes NO emotion with HORRIBLE acting. It promotes stereotypical roles of Blacks, and it is not even entertaining."
5,Outer tie rod,"MADE IN USA not China. Moog front end parts are the only way to go. They will hold up better than the factory parts will and if proper maintenance is performed, will never need replacing, I have been using them for many years and have never needed to replace one yet, unlike the foreign made ones, sure, you may get a lifetime replacement warranty with the foreign made ones but, once I replace a component, I shouldn't have to replace it again period!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Scarne does it again! First I discovered Scarne invented poker. Now I learn that he invented every other popular card game out there. Don't waste your time or money reading this book. Scarne wastes most of the space, as he does in his other books, bragging about himself. The book is over 400 pages long and it only addresses NINE games: Gin Rummy, Black Jack, Poker, Pinochle, Cribbage, Pitch, Casino, Kalabrais, and Hearts (including, of course, ""Hearts According to Scarne""). Now, if you really really wanna learn how to determine if someone's cheating you in Rummy or determine if the cards in your Pinochle game are marked, I guess you can read those chapters. Much of the stuff in this book appears to be little more than cut and pasted from Scarne's other books anyway.Overall, very little useful information and Scarne is so arrogant throughout the book that you'll quickly grow weary and turn the TV on."
2,"Good for Scoop and Lofty vehicles, but that's it.","While my son loves Scoop and Lofty and plays with them a ton, there is basically nothing else to this set, as the pieces you are left won't build much of anything. You can see on the box that you are only able to barely build the facade of a house with a window and two roof pieces, and a frame of a building. You at least get a caravan/little house with a door, windows, and stairs with the Travis set, my pick for the best of the series. Even the Muck set that comes with the recycling bins and chute offers more play value.With all the vehicles, you can't play heavy with them, as the pieces usually pop off. This set is very pricey, so I would only get it if your child has to have these two characters, becauase that's all you are paying for. It should have come with a little something better to build, especially for the price."
3,"Could be better, but not bad","The price is a bit lofty (pardon the pun) for what you actually get. A price of $25.00 would be better suited. The main reason I got this for my 2 year old son is the fact that until the age of three, there are no good construction toys on the market. At least, none that look like the things they're supposed to be (Little Tikes and Tonka - please, the stuff looks more like spaceships!). My son just loves construction equipment but since he can't have anything metal at this age, this is the only option. The accompanying parts are really of no value and the inherent problem with Lego theme sets is that there is little option for variation in the construction of the pieces. That having been said, this toy got the biggest smile when he unwrapped it (possibly because of the Bob the Builder theme, but maybe because of the appearance too), and he has been playing with it consistently since Christmas. And I think he will for quite some time."
2,"Disappointed, but I should have known better...","First let me say that I have always been a C.the E. fan. I love his work. I've been watching him since the early 90's. He's hillarious. I'm really happy that he's found success in his career.BUT... this book is not good. It's pretty poorly written and really isn't that funny. I think I laughed out loud once. Maybe it's hard for me to make it sound funny as I read it. I'm certain that I'd laugh at things written in the book if the author were saying them in person.I bought it to support the brother and sort of show that WE do read. I should have saved my money. Cedric the Entertainer is a comedic entertainer, not a writer."
5,"Pound,Pound Cedric Bro",couldn't put this Book down.Cedric always covers a wide range of topics&Speaks to everybody but comes straight on with any subject matter.I've dug Cedric for a long time&this Book is a must for Fans of His Material&Vibe.Right On!
4,One of their best recordings.,"FANTASTIC! Very uplifting. This will put you in the mood to praise, praise, praise. It is also greatfor a retreat."
2,Incorrect Material,"There are several websites which directly reference this material in giving legal definitions ([...] for instance). I can tell you that every article on ""proximate cause"" is completely wrong. It conflates the definition with ""actual cause"" and then says a ""but for"" test is used to determine proximate cause. I realize that some judges even get this wrong, but I would be afraid to use an encyclopedia that does.I will go check out an actual copy and then modify this review."
5,Hidden Gem,"I just happened to rent this movie on Amazon Instant Videos and found it to be a very moving story with a terrific title. I was initially drawn to it because of Kim Dickens, Gabriel Mann and Don Cheadle and other work they have done but had never heard of the movie before. A wonderful and worthwhile rental!"
5,Gets the job done!,This is a very good product that gets everything done. Only downside is that the lcd light doesn't stay on. Other than that good product for it's price.
3,It has a problem you can't really avoid,"If these are put into the stapler in several pieces, it's likely that the stapler will get stuck on them. If you put one long single in, it works perfectly. However, there's no way to insure that the staples are in one piece since you and the seller wouldn't know until you check them, and even then, the delivery might break them apart."
1,They don't fit ... not 5/16-Inch staples,"Don't fit - wouldn't fit my 5/16-inch stapler and wouldn't fit m,y wife's 5/16-inch stapler. Different manufacturers too - of for 2 STINKS !"
4,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review,"This is a great game, it is action packed and the online game play is the est feature it has."
3,Call of Duty 4,"The graphics were AWESOME but the game itself isnt anything to get excited about, it only has a 4 hour campaign. Might be okay for online play though.."
5,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - Best (Human Only) War Game EVER!!!,This game is amazing on any console. Both the PS3 and the 360 versions are great in every way. A must-have for any FPS fan.Main story is a bit short but the game makes it up with Online Play.Graphics - 5/5 (up to 1080p on both consoles)Gameplay Value - 4.7/5Online Mode - 4.9/5Sound - 4.5/5Weapons - 5/5 (Modern weapons that are completely up to date)One thing the game doesn't have is Co-op play.If anyone sees this game on sale and doesn't buy it has no right to call themselves a gamer or a console owner.My PSN ID - GTASMYMy GamerTag - GTASMYPS the name on my account is not my name its my mom'smy name is Steven
4,A great multiplayer experience.,"This game is very fun. The single player is enjoyable despite it being a little short, graphics are really a treat for the eyes. The game features some intense combat as expected from a Call of Duty title. But the real treat is in the multiplayer part of the game. You gain experience by completing challenges and killing the enemy as you play online. As you level up your character you unlock new ""Perks"" and weapons to play with. The game is highly addictive for this reason. I highly recommend it for any shooter fan."
4,un poco confuso,"los graficos son buenos, pero lo que no me gusto es que causa un poco de confucion el no saber quienes son tus aliados (por que nunca vas solo)sino hasta que los tienes en la mira. por ese detalle le resto una estrella!"
4,Better than Ghost Recon 2,"COD 4 is a much better and more realistic game than Ghost Recon 2. The only thing it lacks is length. I think they could have had another mission. There are a few different bad guys out there that they could have put in the game. After 6 hours of gameing the story ended. The game itself was very realistic, made me feel I was back in Iraq sometimes.The little mission after all the credits is probably the funnest mission of the game. There should be more of those in the game next time. So once you beat this game let the credits roll through there is one more mission after the credits."
5,Amazing game,This game has to be one of the best games out there right now. Graphics are amazingly crisp and smooth! Game play is great! A lot of people complain that the game is short taking approximately 5-6 hours to complete. Part of the reason for this is the frequent checkpoints so you don't waste 30 minutes and repeating everything. The character constantly regenerates health so you don't die so quickly compared with a lot of other games. You'll enjoy playing without all the frustrations.Highly recommended.Know that there is no co-operative play with this game.
4,"Nice FPS, but no Cooperative","One of the features I love about FPS, no matter how long or short their campaings are is the cooperative option. I love it, it's so much fun. Some people love FPS for their online experience, I love playing online, I just wish it had cooperative, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"This game has a virus on it, do not purchase it! It almost ruined my husband's PS3. I bought it on accident, thinking it was another COD game. When it arrived my husband put it into the PS3 & immediately the screen froze, and it started doing weird things to the PS3. Ridiculous."
3,"Average Game, Overall","One of the things that was really disappointing about this game was how short it was. My next complaint is that this game was too busy. It was jumping between 3-4 different places, in the Mid East and former Soviet Union states. Fun game but not nearly as much fun as Resistance/Uncharted/inFamous."
5,awesome,"graphics are amazing, game play is amazingbuy it.i havent tried the online yet but im pretty sure itll be amazing also."
4,First-time PS3 Owner and FPS Newbie,"First, let me say that I'm a PC gamer more than a console gamer, but I recently bought this game along with my Playstation 3 40 GB. Also, I tend to enjoy simulations and RPGs more than anything.After hearing and reading about all the great and positive things about this game, I decided to buy it. I must say I'm not at all that thrilled. Ten minutes into the game, I started to get queasy and felt like I wanted to throw up. It's challenging enough for a new Playstation player who's used to a computer keyboard to handle a SIXAXIS controller, but the gyroscopic camera movements on-screen are also very nauseating! I had to take a dose of PEPTO-BISMOL afterwards. The controls are just very frustrating; I keep running into walls and the floor and the ceiling, and the walls and the ceiling and the floor. Are all FPS games like this?The graphics are excellent, however. My nephew, who also owns a PS3, is going to be excited when I gladly bequeath this to him."
2,This Game goes Down on 6/18/08,Once SOCOM Confrontations comes out on june 18th get ready to find no one online in COD4
1,AOD4 sucks sucks,"Haveing read numerous review, i decided to buy. After playing, i hate it. I get stuck in the campaign. Too boring i have to pratice over the same tutorial. There is no 1vs1 for beginner offline where i learn and have fun at the same time. sucks. No fun for beginners."
3,"Fantastic, short game","This game is incredible, but short. I've never gone through an entire mission so quickly. Activision might take lessons from UbiSoft or Microsoft when it comes to the amount of game play and content included. Even the original Halo and Splinter Cell both include MUCH more content and game play than Call of Duty 4. I paid $50 for less than half of the game play. Very disappointing. Before we know it, we'll be paying $100 for an hour of game play."
5,Best Game for PS3 So,The best first person shooter so far. RB6 was good this is better. I have only played the multiplayer mode and it just owns. Get the game
3,Should last longer,The game and graphics were amazing but I was able to finish the game within just a few weeks and I am an adult with a job and kids so I don't play 24 hours a day. Would have been better if it was a longer senario.
4,"Good game, great service by amazon.","I chose free shipping and it was delivered on time, this game is fun, overall a good purchase."
5,Great Gameplay,i didn't think this game would be good compared to the newer cod. But the gameplay is perfect along with great graphics.i bought this just to play never thought it would be this good. Great game
3,Overrated,"I own both and I prefer the gaming style of Medal of Honor Airborne. COD4 feels like you're just being swept along with the monotonous storyline. The online play bugged me. It's not fun just being blasted away by other players. There's no strategy, no stealth. Lame."
5,Better than Halo (sorry Halo fans),"I only say it's better than Halo because of the online multiplayer. COD4 is by far the best of its genre. Just the realism of the guns, damage to buildings and people is outstanding. I have Assassin's Creed still in its wrapper because I'm addicted to this game. COD4 beats Rainbow Six: Las Vegas and GRAW2 hands down. I'll pretty much not play those games again.If you don't have COD4 yet, get it. Trust me, you will not regret that purchase."
4,great game,the offline part of this game is flawless but the online needs some workat first they had problems with the servers but it sort of got fixed and they should allow us to pick the rooms ourselves instead of autoplayinghowever this game has got to be the most in-depth online ever with so many unlocks and ranks this game will take a long time to get bored of
3,Short Lived Fun,This is a pretty good game. It is engaging and lots of different action. Its just a little bit short. That's all.
1,Yeah right.,"Not a fan. 12 minutes of playing and my PS3 stopped working. Game play was great, too bad it cost me the functioning of my PS3."
4,Good game. But be warned. There are many hackers online,"I originally played COD4 on wii of all systems. But it was still a great experience. I played the hell out of it. The online was addicting. After a while I stopped playing the wii version and decided to get the ps3 version. The gameplay is still the same,fun addicting,this is an amazing game for how old it is. and people still love playing it online. Except there are A LOT of hackers on the multiplayer. I mean A LOT. You will have to leave every other game unless you want to be in a hacked match...Also sometimes there are some TERRIBLE hosts that will lag your game...Not always but sometimes there will be. If you find a game with out hackers and with GOOD hosts you will have a lot of fun. Just know what you're buying here!.."
3,This game is okay but not so great as other review said,"Having done later version of COD, I didn't find this game as fascinating as others described. Maybe it's because I did play newer version before hand. Anyway, I would recommend not to buy one if you already played and have other COD games."
3,Game,The purchase and delivery of this item was great and simple. The game itself was very easy and I would only recommend it if you have online access.
4,Could be better,"I really liked this game, but I would have liked it more if it was not so short. I beat it in a day. Graphics are very realistic, however the game would have been more fun if the backgrounds were more interactive like in Black for the PS2. I was hoping to destroy most everything I saw. It's a different game than previous COD'S but vastly better. My only other small gripe is I wanted to see another nuke explosion when the timer ran out. All we get is time's up. I'm sure there is more than enough room on a PS3 disc to have seen huge nuclear explosions. Still, the first nuke explosion was very satisfying graphically. It rocked. Maybe in the next COD we can use a few nukes against the bad guys. That would rule!"
5,COD4 fun,The online component is so awesome. The splitscreen 4 player for playing with friends is great as well. I hope they update this to include rumble in the future.
2,Pretty to look at but boring once you get to know it....,"Visually, a very appealing game indeed. Trouble is, there's this pesky linear aspect to it. As with many games like these, one starts to feel like one is a geriatric being wheeled about from one zoo exhibit to the next.Long and the short of it. If you like games for their playability this one falls short IMHO. I guess I'll just have to stick with good old Battlefield 2 as it seems to be the only serious FPS."
3,game of the year,"I thought this game sucked, it was entirely too fast paced for me. I just finished playing MGS4 and you can go through that game without killing hardly anyone. CoD4 is just guns blazzing through the whole game with some 2 cent storyline that should have been just left out. If your too close to the enemy they will smack you with their weapon and your character dies, if you jump out in front on the enemy you can only survive like three shots before you die."
2,Multiplayer problems,"This is a fantastic game and by far the best in the series. However, the multiplayer mode on PS3 has been riddled with technical problems since release date. The biggest of which have been player stats not being recorded and reset, server instability and server outtages. In fact on the weekend of the games release, the multiplayer mode was completely inaccessable for almost a day.Before buying i strongly recommend reading through the forums on the charlieoscardelta website to see what the owners of the game are saying.There is a major patch in the works but as yet there is no E.T.A."
4,New Role-model for Multiplayer FPS,"When I first started playing this game on campaign mode, it was fun, challenging at some points but entirely too short. The campaign could use some length (as with any video game now-adays) although what was available was well written. The thing that i liked best about this game was its multiplayer ability. It reminded me of the good (and cheaper) days of Goldeneye 007 for good old Nintendo 64. Although much better graphics, obviously, and better game engine altogether, this game will just as much be a multiplayer classic as that was, far outdoing the overated Halo multiplayer capabilities where players see who can jump around the best and get a headshot, CoD4 requires less time to become a decent (more time to become excellent) player, allowing people to pick up the game and perform competently enough to grow a few ranks and have fun not getting sniped every time they spawn (in most cases haha)."
4,Great game and good online game!!,Love playing this game online.. way better than rainbow six vegas 2 but not as good as ghost recon 2 AWF online!
5,Excellent....Very Romantic Songs,I liked the way the group Los Fantasmas Del Caribe put together this whole entire CD. It contains in my knowledge their greatest hits.
2,I thought it was a great product...but my cats...not so much!,"I got the unscented because I was struggling to find a cat litter that my picky little angels would use. Unfortunately, this one was not the magic product. I love the arm&hammer; line of products and what little they used this one was a great experience (little weird to say...cat poop and all), but my cats hated it and they have the final say in that department...So, if your cat will use it, then by all means it is a great product, but unfortunately it is up to the kitties on this one.Now when I say great product: clumps well, odor control is awesome even without the smelly good stuff and not as much dust as some other brands I've tried."
4,My cat pees on this.,"When I have to buy something for my cat to pee on, I choose Arm & Hammer Clumping Litter. Ordering it from Amazon is pleasant, because it means I don't have to carry it all the way from my car to the litter box, whining all the way as the little plastic handle cuts into my handflesh.I would prefer some kind of diaper service for my cat, but this is an acceptable second choice."
1,"Sad to say, some things should remain a memory",I was given this by a friend and thought that I vaguely remembered it from my youth. As i watched this I was struck by how poor the animation was and how under cooked the stories were. I know most of the reviews on here are favorable but I just can't say that this one aged as well as some of the other shows that they are bring out now. This one just didn't work for me.
3,Blast from the Past,"I got this mainly because it was something from my childhood. To be honest I was pleasently surprised. The stories were so so, but the cartoon artwork is actually better then some of what you see today. The story is simple enough, histories greatest heroes are gathered to defend a mystical realm. They kick butt, share the love and the story always has a moral. Remember when all cartoons were like that?"
3,"Rather Disappointing, Actually.","I'd hoped for a nice selection of crafts. While a few of the items listed are interesting and ""crafty"" (the quilt, bead crafts, straw hat, hood), most are defintely stretching the definition. I wouldn't consider a garden or a loaf of bread to be a 'craft'... and does anyone REALLY need instructions to figure out how to make a button string? The original Little House books explain quite well how to make the orange flower and button lamp. (And what you'd do with a decorative button lamp is a puzzle to me anyway.) We learn how to make the tassles for Mary's bedshoes, but there are no instructions for making the shoes themselves."
3,A less-than-respectful treatment of the skilled crafts...,"I know that Carolyn Collins and Mary Collier wanted to keep their craft projects as simple as possible, so that they would be fun for our TV-glutted, skill-deprived youngsters. But in doing so, they curtailled themselves from creating a masterpiece of historical analysis like The Little House Cookbook.How about showing some of the REAL projects that we read about in the Little House books, like the dresses that Laura and Mary laid out by drafting patterns on old newspaper, or the cabinetry that Almanzo built to delight his wife?Aside from very young children, the handy people described in the Little House books manufactured items that were more useful and complex than Brownie Scout camp crafts. That it bears the ""Little House"" brand name does not separate this book from the pack."
4,Teacher's View for My Little House Craft Book,"This book is a great opportunity to learn about crafts and stories through the eyes and hands of a pioneer child. Children will enjoy the stories from Laura Ingles Wilder. With each story, a craft is illustrated with colorful pictures and detailed step by step instructions that are very easy to follow. A great teaching tool and a good book to add to your shelf."
5,Great blade for portable trim saws.,"This blade is great. I used it to cut poplar 1x3 & 1x2 for face frame trim, and select pine 1x3. The cut left a smooth finish with no tearout. So much easier to use this on my 18 volt cordless saw than to lug out the big milwaukee circ for trim work."
5,"Animals, animals, animals, and more animals...",I love animals and my parents have been giving me a new animal every week for since my birthday. I like the animals a lot. They are pretty and look very real because the small animals are small and the big animals are big. I want go get all of the animals and I hope they make more animals.
5,Hidden Agenda,"Brooklyn's Oneida have been around for nearly ten years now and in the process have released six albums. To tell the truth there aren't many bands which mix Sonic Youthy punk with kraut-rock and some jazz thrown in so well. In fact there ISN'T a band that does that!!!! Although quite an influential band, they have never really gotten the recognition that they deserve, so hopefully with their sixth album `Secret Wars' things will change.Where their sound was more aggressive, now its become a bit more accessible and ...yes there are quite a few catchy tunes (Treasure Plane, Captain Bo Dignifies Allegations with a Response). In fact, the aforementioned `Treasure Plane' is a fantastic song and really sets the tone of this record. Throughout the album, the quality doesn't dip and the band even manage to pull off a 14 minute song AND not be boring. Well done, a record to treasure."
2,Vitality Super Green,I have been going through cancer treatments for the past seven months doing fairly well through it all. I ordered this product to add to my arsenal of health care products mainly looking for that burst of energy I read about from reviews on this product. I have also read Donna Gates ideas on health and felt pretty much in alignment with them. In taking this product everyday for almost the past month I will say I don't feel that burst of energy I was looking for and though the product carries some good ingredients for the price I will not reorder. I feel I can do better with my green drinks by adding in my own ingredients and probably for less $.
4,Great stuff(:>,My doctor told me to use a green food at least once a day. I especially like Vitality super greens because the greens are ferminted...I just ordered two more containers. The only draw-back is the price... Another product that I enjoy I get a two month supply for just a couple of dollars more than I pay for 1 month supply of Vitality Super Greens. Thus only 4 stars.
5,cris in concert! what more can you ask?,"i've only had the pleasure of seeing cris in concert once at the bottom line in nyc, but it was an experience that i will never forget. while i was unable to attend this concert in celebration of CHANGER's anniversary, i listen to this album and feel like i am there in the audience. she showcases not only the CHANGER AND THE CHANGED, but also a wondeful collection of songs from the start of her career to the time of the concert.cris has a wonderful sense of familiarity with her audience and it truly shows on this wonderful recording.while the cd isn't the same as seeing her live, it is still a magical experience.any of cris williamson's cd's are worth purchasing. she is a sound and soul healer."
1,Hustler Squad SUCK'S!!!!!,"I don't know about the movie Wild Riders because I wasn't interested, but here is my review on Hustler Squad:The cover REALLY FOOLED ME!!! I feel like a sucker! I thought this movie was about five female soldiers that shoot up millions of ememies like in the movie Commando, Rambo 2 or The Losers. BUT NOOOO!!!! The girls didn't do ANYTHING!!! They just shot a couple of bad guys and left the rest of the enemies for the male soldiers! Of course, the action scenes were so-so, the graphics were blurred, and the story was stupid.Another thing, the movie has only 3 action scenes: one at the begining, the second in the middle, and the third one at the end. The first and the third one were the longest but they were set at midnight, so you won't see the action so clear.The only positive thing, is that the dvd has a cool intro with commercials, cartoons and movie previews before the movie starts. The rest is garbage.Adios."
4,no title,"Whew! What a tome! Oversized paperback of over 600 pages and thin paper at that. Filled with any and everything about bicycles you could possible imagine. Lots of terrific illustrations and pictures, many from very early times. Much so darned technical, about all the zillion parts of a bike, that I must admit I skimmed over. Pages and pages of footnotes, a glossary and a huge, huge bibliography containing even videos and artwork and music about bikes. This book just leaves no stone unturned in discussing its subject. It's more than you want to know. Even recipes, which of course I made, two of which were horrible; the pasta carbonera and fruit punch delicious. Perry is to be commended for the extraordinary amount of work done to write this treatise."
4,GOOD BARGAIN TO BUY ESSENTIAL DISCO HITS IN just 1 CD,"Begining with Chic's ""le freak"", it is a good start that this Canadian import shall turn you on first, warming up your legs with Donna Summer's ""BAD GIRL"", following the ""must"" anthem ""we are family"", pumping up the mood to ""born to be alive"" by Patrick Hernandez, I am sure you must be at point of no return: too hot to stop! Rarely, boney M's ""rasputin"" is compiled here in North America! Good deal! CONSIDER THIS IF YOU CARE FOR DISCO MUSIC!"
3,Different artists,"Picked this CD because I wanted ""Born to be Alive"" by Patrick Hernandez..amazingly the CD I got did not have this artist and song on it. Although the seller was based here in the US the postage was from Argentina. So I was defintely a bootleg copy of the CD that was advertised. Will this stop me from buying on Amazon..well CD's maybe."
3,Le CD vol. 2 est moins bon que le CD vol. 1,"Je dois avouer que ce CD a environ 6 à 8 bonnes chansons, pas plus. Il est moins bon que le volume 1. Si vous tes des personnes qui ont grandi dans les années 70s et que vous voulez rappeler des bonnes vieilles années, c'est un must pour vous. Mais, si vous tes fan de disco des années 90s et 2000, je ne vous le conseil seulement si vous reconnaissez les vrais bonnes chansons. Les meilleures chansons sont : Freak, Bad Girls, We are Family, Born to be alive, Rasputin', Flashdance...What a feeling, Saturday Night et Car Wash. En conclusion, Acheter ce CD si vous tes vraiment accros de disco."
1,Error Errors Errors,"This book has the MOST amount of technical and coding errors I've seen in an ActionScript book in a long time (not the worst--ISBN: 0072222662).I've tech-edited two other Flash books and I'm thinking the tech-editors of this book should learn ActionScript before they attempt to tech-edit their next book. Or at least read it before sending it off.They just had to come out with this book before Colin Moock came out with his or else no one would buy it.The Author, Jeff Tapper, is sick of getting emails about how bad this book is and he said it was a fiasco from start to finish so I'm thinking some marketing jerkwad rushed the book out the door.More bad desicions in the marketing department end up wasting some more time and trees.Save your money."
2,My first New Riders Book...Maybe my last...,"I hate to be another person to mention the large amount of typos and poorly formatted code, but I can't help it. It truely is as terrible as everyone says.I have past programming and Actionscript experience, so it's pretty easy to pick out the errors in the code examples. So, I'm hoping that the author's updated downloadable code will help me feel better about spending money on this book.Currently I'm about 200 pages into the book, other then typos and poor code formatting, the book seems like it might be a good primer to help me get started. If they do a second edition of this book they should definitely take the time to explain what's happening in the code in greater detail. Some of the concepts and examples leave you wishing that there was another paragraph/page or two about what was done.This is my first New Riders book and if this is what I should expect, it will definitely be the last. The editors at New Riders should be ashamed."
5,An Excellent Resource for Programmers,I found this book to be an excellent resource for learning Action Script 2.0...As a programmer this book is everything I need to write Flash applications.
5,I am in Love.,I love Rosette and have forever I have wanted this for a very long time and now my collection is complete. :)
5,Don't pass this up!,"Eric Dodge's second CD is fantastic. Fun to listen to and enjoyable to hum or tap your toes along with - each song is unique in content and sound but the entire album blends seamlessly. If you enjoy Country - you will enjoy it. If you would not consider yourself a Country fan but enjoy anything short of hard rock - give it a try. The song themes seem to transcend age group, class, or location barriers and just hit us right in the soul. The absence of four letter words is just a plus to an already excellent recording."
4,"Good, mild introduction to a great satirist","This book is, justifiably, not as famous as _Candide_, but is still a great sample of Voltaire's thinking--and therefore a great example of Enlightenment discourse. In these letters Voltaire criticizes France by praising England, and begins to develop ideas about religion, democracy, and social convention that he continued to work on throughout his life. For my taste, _Philosophical Dictionary_ is more exciting, but these letters are more inviting, and also give insight into the connections between England and France that obviously lie at the heart of their historical antipathy."
2,NOT originally written in English!,"As the other reviewers mention, the main selling point of this edition is that it contains Voltaire's original English versions of some of the letters - this is proclaimed on the back cover, and is the theme of the critical introduction.Yet as the little tucked away ""Supplementary bibliography (2005)"" says on page xxxvi:""Since the first publication of this edition in 1994, it has been shown that Voltaire wrote all the text of the Letters in French, and that the Letters Concerning the English Nation are a translation by John Lockman"".So, this edition does NOT contain Voltaire's own words, but rather a bad translation from 1742. It seems it was too much hard work for Nicholas Cronk to rewrite his introduction, or even for OUP to change the back cover.As it stands, much of the critical material is rendered obsolete, though perhaps less so than the 250 year-old translation.Buy the Penguin edition instead - modern translation, half the price, no disproven theories."
1,Poor Quality,"I replaced because I had lost cruise control everything worked fine for about a mile , started hearing a noise like breaking plastic and the lost cruise control air bag and the horn reinstalled the orignal everything is workiing again except the cruise control the reason I was replacing it .I will go to Dodge and buy an OEM clock spring ."
1,unusable as shipped,poor quality workmanship bad solder connections cruse control plugs not the same as oem and no continuity on one lead
5,Easy to Use!,"This is an awesome camcorder, especially for a first time user. It is very easy to use. The picture quality is awesome. I just got it so I'm still playing around with it. It also takes still pics, which is a good feature if something really cute happens and your camera is not handy, but I try not to waste my disc space on pics since I already have a digital camera. The only thing I do not like about the camcorder is you can't delete pictures or video from the disc once you taken them (like you can with a digital camera)or record over them. Once it's on the dvd it's there for good. Now if there is another dvd like a dvdrw that you can do this on, I don't know. I will look into it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Sure this camera was good for 4 months and about 12 uses. Then when we used it the last time, the battery died. The camera shut down and we were never able to power it back up again, even plugged directly into the wall itself, bypassing the battery. I called Panasonic and they gave me some verification number and an address to get it fixed, they also said they'd send me some papers which I never recieved. I sent it to the service center and they just called me and told me that they need a flat rate of $211 before they even touch it! I only paid $198 for it. I am so mad, I cannot afford to give them $211! I am at a loss here. Why do these companies make junk! I will NEVER BUY PANASONIC AGAIN!"
3,It's OK,"The cam is OK, but the one touch navigation & Joystick control is very bad. The cam came in a old box. Looks like used for the second time."
3,Some pieces are difficult to put together!!,My 3 year old son has difficulty attaching the arms and excavating portion of muck as it requires more *strength*.The box says it is for kids 2-5 .Otherwise it is quite durable but somehow he doesn't get satisfaction of building muck on his own.
1,Watch the size,"These tights were labeled plus size so I bought them. But when they got here I couldn't even get them on. I'm plus size but not more than a size 20, and they were way way too small. I can't even use them."
1,not good,This fell apart the minute I picked them up from their box. They detached from the waistband. Would not reccommend.
4,I LOVE LUCIEN,"I just discovered Lucien K. Truscott, and look forward to reading all of his books. Good plot, believable characters...female protagonist... male author...and done well! Left me wondering, and worrying, how Kara and Mace will resolve their unacceptable relationship. KEEP WRITING, LUCIEN!"
2,"Great Movie, Bad DVD!","Excellent horror movie, but bad dvd. Troma blows, No effort.I wish anchor bay would have done this. The transfer is awful. tHE SOUND IS REALLY BAD. lOTS of hiss. And no extras pertaining to the film. No trailer. Nothing.. I hope in future someone else will pick this one up and give it a better treatment.."
2,Terrible sound quality....,The sound quality in this version is worse than the VHS. You can barely hear the dialogue... No excuse for the price. Shame on the distributor.
3,TROMA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"AS A CHILD BACK IN THE 80'S I REMEMBER ON SATURDAY MY COUSIN AND I WOULD RENT 3-4 HORROR MOVIES FOR THE WEEKEND. FRIGHTMARE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE HORROR MOVIES INCLUDING A HOST OF OTHER HORROR MOVIES THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD,EVIL DEAD, GALAXY OF TERROR, DAWN OF THE DEAD, AND SO ON. FRIGHTMARE IS ABOUT A HORROR ACTOR THAT DIED AND A BUNCH OF PUNKS STOLE HIS CORPSE FROM THE CEMETERY AS A PRANK. HE THEN TAKES REVENGE ON THE PUNK@$$ KIDS. ITS ALL BASIC STUFF WITH GOOD GORE BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE DVD IN FACT ALL OF TROMA FILMS THAT COME OUT ON DVD REALLY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Frightmare.,"Frightmare is too cheesy for my taste, it is a really bad b-movie,troma comes up in the credits/production co and you know it's bad."
1,Not much use,"The light these give out would work well enough for small, dark spaces, however it is the problem of mounting them in such a way that the magnetic switch is close enough to work (ex. turn the light on or off on demand as when a door or drawer is opened) and yet have the light mounted to face a functional direction. I find that the magnet has to be about 1/4 to 1/3 inch away from the light and directly in front in order to work, thus the photo illustrations of the lights as positioned in the drawers, toolboxes, cabinets, etc. simply cannot work for all practical purposes. Therefore I find that I have simply wasted the money that I spent to illuminate my drawers and cabinets. If these lights could be turned on by pressing a switch, they would be far more functional. More detailed information about how the lights operated would have been much appreciated before I purchased. It's a great idea but lacks some practicality."
3,They're very small,"These little lights are just that...little. Each one measures about 2"" x 1"" x 1/2"" (more or less). I didn't buy them for my kitchen cabinets, but tested a light in one to see what it would be like. When the kitchen light was on, the little light made no difference. The only time it was useful was if the kitchen was pitch black. If you are looking for a little light to light a little space in accute darkness, this is for you. If not, keep looking."
2,"Lights light, but adhesive tape is very weak","I purchased this product to provide light inside cupboards in my camper. I installed them per directions and made sure the surfaces I stuck them to were clean. I'm not sure if the foam double side tape on back of the lights was old or just weak, but they did not stay stuck, falling after only a few hours in some places and once they fell down the lights would come on and drain the batteries. The light was adequate for my use so I'm bummed they haven't worked out. I'm going to use some new double sided foam tape and see if that works better. I thought I'd really like this product, but as of now not so much."
3,Good CD,This CD was purchased as a gift to go with another of Erhu music I also purchased. I haven't listened to it as yet but it looks great. Won't be able to provide more feedback until the person it is for receives it.
5,Tradition Chinese Music,Another great album of Chinese themed music. Relaxing and reminicent of the oldest civilization on earth.
4,Great Music for T'ai Chi,"I was looking for appropriate background music for practising T'ai Chi and this album was pretty good. The best cut for my purposes was ""The Moon Mirrored in the Pool"". It is smooth and slow, just right for T'ai Chi."
3,Phases of the Moon: Traditional Chinese Music,"Received this CD in open envelope, not taped. CD case was broken but no damage to CD itself, plays well. Causes doubt if I will buy from Amazon again. It was my first order with Amazon."
3,Not what I expected,I expected more singing and it was on the low end of music I've heard before from the far east.
5,Grand and beautiful,"This is a selection of orchestral music, including some beautiful, grand and moving pieces, from all across China. It is played by a (communist) Chinese orchestra using traditional instruments, organised along modern (European) lines, and the resulting synthesis is one of enchanted magnificence and awe which truly reaches within the soul. It also conveys the mystery and potential of Chinese creativity and its powerful yet delicate beauty."
5,Beautiful music,"This release provides a wide spectrum of orchestral music from the many regions of China. Using traditional Chinese instruments, these musicians present a widely varied set of music that ranges from sublimely tranquil to inspirationaly rousing. Every selection is of outstanding quality. My favorites include The Moonlight Reflected on the Pool and The Dance of the Yao People."
4,"Enjoyable and lovely, but ""traditional""?","This delightful CD is surprisingly melodic and Western. It is ""traditional"" only in the sense that the instruments are traditional. Otherwise it sounds heavily influenced by the Occident. Which is not to detract from its beauty or the virtuosity of the musicians. One would have appreciated more informative liner notes."
4,Nice cover,"Nice quality, functional tonneau cover. Very sturdy construction with quality parts. Fit and finish is nice, but the only thing that I would say that is negative is that it does hang over the back edges just a bit. This is really more of an issue with the truck bed being tapered a bit towards the rear, and I am not sure if the tonneau cover could have been shaped the same way, but I imagine it could have been.I bought this particular model for one main reason, which is for when I have to drive the garbage cans down to the end of the driveway. I can just flip the back part up and throw the garbage cans in there, which fit nicely in the small opening and don't have much opportunity to tip over. Also, I seem to be getting better gas mileage and feel less drag having this cover installed."
1,sounds like a all natural product,"Be warned, I was fooled into thinking this was a natural product because of the essential oils, but after water, the next ingredient is aluminum chlorohydrate. They do not make any all natural claims that I can see, but I read a review somewhere that made the claim."
3,Picture is misleading,I ordered three of these blades thinking I was going to receive the Permashield coated blades. I got the standard bare metal finish. They work fine just not what I expected/wanted.***********Edit************Apparently someone at Amazon updated the picture to the correct blade. Still can't beat the performance of the red Permashield coated blades.
5,Great Value,"I bought this set for my 23 month old son who usually has a limited attention span. It keeps him occupied for an hour at a time. The pieces are simple enough to put together (and I can help him do this with one hand while I hold my 2 mth old son in the other) and sturdy enough so that they do not fall apart easily. He also has the Thomas Train duplo set, but that set requires much more set up and frustrates him easily. This Bob the builder set is a great playset for him since it is colorful, very easy to handle, and very versatile with the different things he can do. He also loves the Bob and cat figures that come with the set."
3,The Resistance,"The invasion is starting to speed up, the animorphs series has started to get a bit continuous between books 25 and 40. Now it looks as if things are starting to change. There are two stories to this book. One is about the Hork Bajir being discovered and the other is about Jake`s ancestor from the civil war which I didn`t like much (why I gave the book three stars). The story seemed to go off the boil a bit because every other chapter was Jake`s ancestor, Isaiah Fitzhenry`s journal from the cival war. Apart from that it was really good. The Animorphs and Ax have to make the most importent decision they`ve ever had to make: Do they continue to fighy the Yeerks in secret, or is it time to let everyone know there is a resistance? It`s good how The Animorphs and Ax save the Hork Bajir with a Beaver morph and... well I won`t say much it`a good book worth reading."
4,It Rox!,"I have been a fan of Animorphs since 1996, when I read ""The Invasion"". Since then, I have collected almost every one. Mostly the books are average, but occasionally, you get the one that stands out - this is the next one to stand out! It is simply brilliant! I still think she should end Animorphs while she's ahead though."
2,"Great band, lousy sound","In the late 1960s the Biograph label produced two lps' worth of California Ramblers (""Golden Gate Orchestra"") sides recorded for Edison. It was great to have them available since Edison's vertical-cut discs could not be played on a standard three-speed phono of the time. Unfortunately, they were not all transferred at the proper speed (some Edison discs were recorded at 80 rpm, many others were recorded closer to 78 rpm, especially after 1926), so the resulting improper pitch deterred from the enjoyment of the great music.30 years later, those same tired transfers, complete with incorrect pitch and fake echo, have come back to haunt us in digital form. There are other Ramblers/Golden Gate collections out there (Timeless and Document each have fine sets avaialble) with excellent remastering; that's where anyone interested in this music should start. Shame on Biograph."
5,Action!,"The cultural icon that I most resemble is Charlie Brown. Not only that, but I have a strong theatrical background and have ambitions of someday being a famous film director. Therefore, as soon as I saw this item in the store, I purchased it. Who can forget Charlie trying to direct the Christmas pageant? Like the other Peanuts figures in the series, Charlie is a bit larger than usual toys this size. Not only that, but he has one big head! Despite the seemingly wierd proportions and dimensions, the figure looks like a real-life version of the beloved comic strip and cartoon loser. The figure includes a directors chair, megaphone, stage notes that can actually be read, and a small part of the stage on which the Christmas pageant is supposed to be performed upon. The stage can be connected with the set pieces of other figures in the series. This is a great gift for any Peanuts fan or that own special lovable loser in your life."
3,Item received not as pictured on Amazon,"The toy I received is not the one pictured here on Amazon. Yes, it is the police station, but the colors are less stimulative and just plain dull: dark blue and gray. I think the one pictured is way more fun than the one we received as far as the visual aspect is concerned. Also, the car included in our package was an SUV, not the little police car pictured. Overall, however, it's a fun toy that my 3 year old enjoys from time to time. He's enthralled with anything 'police', so we purchased the 5-pack police squad to go with this police station which was a good move! This toy isn't sturdy, but it's plastic and will last us long enough."
5,Grandsons Police Station,I had this shipped to a grandson and he is having fun using his imagination playing with this police station. It goes well with the matchbox emergency vehicles.
4,Well I loved it....,"This was a Christmas present for one of my nephews. He's more into electronics, but I thought the set was great."
3,good for those with a short torso or skinny arms,"I almost like this posture corrector. It's padded and comfortable on the shoulders. However, the placement of the D-rings is too high for underarm comfort, making it difficult to sit with my arms at my sides (hands on hips is OK). If the center strap were just a couple of inches longer, the underarm straps wouldn't dig into my arm pits and I'd be a lot happier."
1,Very disappointed,I should mention that I am a physician and I bought this product for myself. The product design does not meet the standard of a brace and the fabric/material is very cheap. It is very uncomfortable and simply useless. I sent it back and I have never received my money back.
3,Pretty Good,"This item works, but is slightly difficult to put on/take off without help. No directions come with product either. For the price, a good deal though."
3,Does okay,"This product is not exactly the greatest. It does sort of put my shoulders in the correct position, but it doesn't adjust in the center like the advertized picture shows, which is where I need the adjustment due to my small build. I put a hand towel under each strap on my chest and that seemed to help. Also it hurts your underarms (which the hand towels also helped with). It's okay though, not worth the price by any means (I could have made this myself with felt fabric), but does help a little."
2,Not as described,"This piece of s*** does not have an adjustable D-ring buckle. It's sewn into place. The straps are too short for a man. You need someone to help fit on. It's a waste of $20. I wish I could return it, but I don't live in the US."
2,Good,Uncomfortable but does it job . Helps keep your shoulders backs and makes you sit or stand up straight while wearing it
3,Does the job,It kept me straight but man did it hurt! It takes time to get use to I guess. Can't keep it on for more then 15 mins at a time.
4,Awkward but in a good way,works great just awkward to put on and take off. Does take the pain out of the middle of my back because it is aiding my posture to stay correct.
1,I haven't received it,"Hi,It has been such a long time and I haven't received it. Can you please help me with it?ThanksBegum Cetiner+31 613 123 777"
2,"Awkward and bulky; if you can stand to wear it, it helps a little!",I used it once and now it's in my closet with other disappointing orthopedics. I'll sell it for a reasonable price!! :-)
2,Effective but gross,"This worked as well as the kava I've used before, but I found it much more of a hassle and an unpleasant experience to actually drink.I am not a fan of the need to massage this in a mesh back for several minutes to make the drink, and if you follow the directions you end up with way too large of a volume to drink in one sitting. I'm not sure how you're supposed to store that, or even if you can. The directions don't say. With the bag that Amazon encourages you to purchase with this at least, many of the large particles escape through and float around in the water. This tasted worse than other kava I've had before and the large particles grossed me out.The kava product I prefer is a much finer ground kind that doesn't require a bag, you just stir it well into milk and drink."
1,Just terrible,As a musician and audio engineer I have to say this book is just terrible. This book contains little to no valuable information. Don't waste your time or money.
5,Notebook glove,"So I did buy this Case for my sony Vaio S460 notebook, and I am very happy with it. It fits like a glove. It is a wetsuit like material, very nice. It keeps it safe from scratches. So I just keep my notebook in this case, and carry ot around in my backpack with ome books. Excelent case, a must buy for anyone who wants to carry their laptop with their usual stuff andnot having to carry an extra bag for tour laptop."
3,Works perfectly except for the corners,"Essentially I have had the same experience as other reviewers. It is a sleeve, not a hardcore protective case, and it functions very well except that the sharp corners of the laptop tend to screw with the zippers on the round corners of the case."
4,Neoprene VAIO Case,Excellent value. Good quality. The little case for the AC power devise is a very nice feature.
2,Be dissatisfied,"Case can protect notebook only from scratches but can't protect from shaking because it made from neoprene which too thin and I think it's too small for vaio 13.3"". I'll be careful and hard to try to put my notebook (model S140E)into case because case is smaller than my notebook."
1,Case quality and style is excellent but,"funny thing is that Sony's own laptop , SZ series, doesn't fit. I had to return it.J"
3,Just a little too small for SZ notebooks.,"I recently purchased an SZ660 Vaio and buoght this AMC1 carrying case from a sony store. I read the product description here on amazon first and it does indeed state it is meant for the S series and 13.3"" notebooks.However, after testing it out, it is too tight for my SZ660. I literally have to stretch the corners to fit around and over the corners of the LCD one at a time. When I remove my laptop, I have to be careful to ""unhook"" it from each corner as to not pull open my LCD from it's closed position.Basically, the material is fine and feels great and offers good protection as a carrying case. It is the size that is the problem for me. If they made the corners a little more rectangular instead of rounded, it would probably fit my SZ660 much more nicely.If you have an SZ notebook, I recommend to not purchase this and to find an alternative carrying case such as Tom Bihn cases."
3,Sony VGP-AMC1 for SZ laptops,"I think this sleeve is designed for Sony S series laptops, and is intended to be used as an additional protection, not a carrying case (no shoulder strap or handle). I bought it for my SZ laptop, and it does fit the laptop but the four corners of the sleeve are really stressed out. In fact, the fit is so tight that I don't think the sleeve would last very long.For a main laptop carrying case, I would recommened the VGP-CCB3 case for a Sony SZ laptop. This carrying case is much sturdier, and it can store the SZ laptop and power adaptor without problems. I use the VGP-CCB3 as the main carrying case for my SZ laptop, and I only use the neoprene sleeve when I transport the laptop in a backback or suitcase."
4,On Vaio SZ-360P/C,"This is a nice sleeve with snug fit on the Vaio SZ series, and I also like the AC adapter case which is really handy if you dont want to carry around a separate laptop bag. The only thing that occurs to me is that the corners are too rounded for the Vaio SZ series, so it is a tight fit on those corners. Maybe some people prefer this tight fit, but I wish it had sharper corners. If you guys are looking for more protection, check out the VGP-CKSZ1, that is one nice case."
5,iPad 2 Secondary Case,"After putting my iPad 2 in a Timbuk2 case (see other reviews) it fits perfectly in this case. Great for backback, overnight bag, etc. Too big though if your iPad 2 is naked."
3,Too small for the Viao 13.3 inch.,"Bought this at the Sony outlet store for the Viao 13.3 inch laptop.The other reviewers are right about the thin neoprene.I'm most disappointed with the zippers, unlike my old neoprene cover for a netbook, there is no neoprene flap protecting the computer from the zipper. This case is too tight on the corners, expect to scratch the machine. There is no sleeve for papers/thumb drives, etc.. that will have to go into the accompanying bag. There are better designed and constructed sleeves out there! (Check Gizmo Dorks models)."
3,Delicious but not very satisfying,"Delicious but not very filling or satisfying no doubt due to the fact it's mostly air. Incidentally, it's my wife's favorite."
3,WHERE IS THE BJORK CARTOON!!!!!,"First let me say that this is a great compilation. There's really nothing bad on this dvd. One glaring omission for me personally, however, is bjork at the oscars (or whatever awards show that was) when Charlton Heston gets up and tries to shoot her after her swan dress comes to life. Does anyone know where I can see that?Gimme that bjork cartoon now. Don't you want my money?"
3,Funny Cartoons but missing some favorites,"Wished they had the first Michael Jackson cartoon in particular - ""Ixnay on the erversionpay, ixnay on the erversionpay""Hopefully when Robert creates enough new ones or stops creating new cartoons altogether, some of the uncollected old ones will be included on a volume 2."
4,Excellent Belt Quality,"The belt is for a 2004 Corolla and it is solid and hope to check on it in a couple of years to see if the quality last. The original belt has more than 63,000 miles on it and was making noise. It has cracks on every inches and still the repair book said that the old belt is acceptable. Did not take any chance, so when the belt arrived, it was installed. And now it is quiet."
5,Arrow Fastener 3/8-Inch Staples,"These staples work very well for affixing phone and internet cable (Cat-3 and Cat-5). Smaller video cable (75 ohm) also fits. Staples grip very well to wood, but also hold on drywall."
4,Beautiful book,this book has beautiful pictures of many Irises and is a pleasure to look through and read. It also gives instruction on how to divide and when to separate every couple of years.
5,Will go through anything.,This flash drive is super small which makes it very convenient. So much so that I accidentally left it in the pocket of my jeans when I put them in the washer. Even after going through the entire wash it still works! I would definitely recommend this sturdy little drive.
2,It's true what people say; this is extremely slow!,"I really like the size of this drive, however, in general it does perform like a USB 1.1 device (or slower). Come'on Lexar...do some testing on your products first!"
4,"Adequate storage, small size, access times may vary","I got a two pack of these recently, so I decided to benchmark them. The benchmarks were inconsistent between the two drives. On the first drive, writes were around 3MB/second, while reads topped out just under 12MB/second. On the second drive, I got 7.5MB/second writes and 17.5MB/s reads.The plastic holder does hold the drive tightly, and it fit on my keyring pretty easily. There is a space on the back of the drive that's available for labeling, but my ink pen just smeared when I tried initialing it. Use a Sharpie instead and let it dry for a minute, that worked fine."
1,A Dismal excuse for a book,"Not impressed. I am a Chem major in my Senior year and I can say with certainty that this book is worthless. The examples are poor, and the problems at the end of each chapter require knowledge not covered within said chapter. I'm not sure what book is better, i'm already out too much money for this one and not wasting more on another one!"
1,Not worth it,"I had homework to do, and since my teacher just ASSUMES everyone has had statistics, he breezed through the stat portion in just a lecture.Well, I hadn't had any stats at all, and needed the solutions manual to try to work out the problems.The solution manual is the exact same as what is in the back of the book. Just the answers to SOME of the problems. Not all. Doesn't show steps.Horrible.I wasted my money."
1,Prepare to waste your time,"This solutions manual is not nearly as helpful as the manuals that accompanied my past gen-chem and o-chem textbooks. The solutions are filled with numbers that have no units , steps are skipped, and there aren't sufficient explanations for tough problems. Overall, this manual does not allow for efficient use of study time. Also, This manual is only about 1/3 the thickness of the text book."
5,OHP,"I want to buy OHP film of this book. But I could not find the way. Please let me know to order OHP for this book. If OHP for Instrumental analysis is avaliable, I want to order that too."
2,"Mask (director's cut, Widescreen)","The movie itself was great and also had added scenes, but this version has a new soundtrack with Bruce Springsteen as the main theme instead of Bob Seger in the original movie. For me this totally changed the movie and especially at the end of the movie with the final song ""Roll me away"" by Bob Seger, was such a special and appropriate song. As you may have noticed, I have purchased the original movie, with the original soundtrack and now have both versions of the movie. Thank you"
5,The mask,This was a movie that I haven't saw in a long time I bought this for someone else but this movie was really good I was happy that I was able to watch it thanks
2,5 stars for Original 2 for Director's Cut,"This Director's Cut is bad, simply because it's not the original threatrical version - I liked the old soundtrack and with this one the Springsteen songs seem way too overused and doesn't fit. It was fine the way it was."
4,tear jerking spectacular,"this movie could well have been rated as an other simple true story, but cher brings this movie sweeping with emotion of love and hate to the eighties, the finale caused me to cry, it was as realistic as if you were there, watch this"
5,Powerful film,Cher&Crew do a Superb job in this film.the Ignorance and Lack of Compassion are reflected thru out this film.it's a Powerful Story and a must see.
5,Very good movie!,"I had never heard of this movie before, let alone seen it, and when my boyfriend suggested it I was pretty wary -- I'm not a big Cher fan (and neither is he), so I took it with a grain of salt that perhaps others' performances overruled her in this film. Not. I was genuinely impressed by her acting in this movie. And Sam Elliott ohhhh don't even get me started. LOVE him. Anyway, it wound up being a very good movie -- I really enjoyed the performance of the boy playing Rocky. A definite recommendation!"
5,A Touching And Unforgettable Film. A True Classic,"What a terrific person. How he could make so many friends despite his disease was very nice. The movie is full of drama and it's topped off with a very sad, but predictable, ending. He wasn't a famous actor or musician, he was just a normal average teen, but his life story and what he accomplished in his lifetime is a better story than 99% of the other biography movies out there. He shows us the best in us and what we can become. Cher did an excellent job playing Rocky's mother. She was very devoted to Rocky and Cher did a excellent job at showing this"
1,Disappointed,As far as the service was concerned I was disappointed as the date for arrival was stated as being the 6th of January and in fact the DVD did not arrive until the 7th. Just in time for me to be able to prepare what I wanted the film for. However the DVD was for USA and not compatable with the machines I tried in the UK. It was not clear on the order form that the DVD was not available for UK machines. I have since returned the DVD and hope to be reembursed.Thank-youPatricia Grady
5,Cher,This is the true movie Cher should have won the Oscar for. I will never forget her remarkable performance.
3,Did not like music in Director's cut,"Buy the original, not the Director's cut. They changed the music from Bob Seger, which I thought fit the movie perfectly to Bruce Springsteen. Bruce's music, while I love the songs, did not match the mood of the movie. I was very disappointed."
4,Not sold on the Director's Cut,"Mask is a terrific movie and one of my all-time favorites. The Director's Cut was interesting in that it showed you some footage left out of the original move. Although fun to watch, I could see why it was left out of the theatrical version. It had a goofy tone that was not matched by the rest of the movie. The use of Bruce Springsteen was also interesting, but not so great that it made me forget Seger's Roll Me Away at the end. The director uses at least half of his commentary time talking about how great Bruce is and how mad he was that his music didn't make it into the original version. And if you aren't a Bruce fan, you will completely miss the timeline the music provides. My advice: obtain any version of this movie that you can, and watch it - it is a classic! But I could do without hearing the director whine endlessly about Bruce Springsteen."
3,Directors Cut ? more like hack!,"This is a great movie but it was ruined for me when the music was changed from bob segers to bruce springsteens, springsteens music is not as good a match to the film as bob segers was.i will be selling this special version and getting the original."
3,Modern Elephant Man.,"I remember seing this tearjerker back in '85 on video only because I'm an Elliott fan, but quite surprisingly, ended up liking it. (-Mostly because it features Lynyrd Skynyrd on the soundtrack, actually.) A heartwarming story about the troubled life of a biker-mom (!) and her different son vs. the world. Though based on a true story, much of the action is naturally (over)played for dramatic effect. It's certainly Cher's finest moment, and Stoltz showed an acting talent he hasn't shown since. (-Apart from ""The Fly 2"", of course.) Stoltz's friend by the way, is that annoying kid who got neck-knifed in ""Friday The 13th, Part 4"". If you like movies that make you cry at the end and happy it's not your life, then you'll want this DVD for your collection."
5,great movie,"this movie has everything going for it.it's true, it's good. Cher, Sam Elliott, Estelle Getty, bikes & great bikers. and people with a back bone.you end up loving all of them. It's a movie you watch over & over."
4,Gift for Friend,I purchased this for a friend and she really liked this movie.I saw the movie when it first aired on tv and I thought it was great.I enjoy most of the movies Cher was in but this is one of my favorites.I especially like Sam Elliott.
4,Moving drama,"An engaging drama about a 16-year-old boy, Rocky Dennis (played by Eric Stoltz), who has a terribly disfiguring bone disease (same illness as the Elephant Man), but also has an incredibly positive outlook on life to go with it. Cher is his mother, who runs around with bikers and takes dope. It's a case of the child being the father to the woman, yet, although he would like his mother to change her ways, he is not critical of her. Her biker friends and Rocky get along marvelously, like an extended family. Cher treats the boy like hard tacks, which seems harsh at times, but is basically best for all concerned. The only misstep is the teenage romance between Rocky and a blind girl played by Laura Dern: it's overy sentimental (it reminded me of the blind girl in FRANKENSTEIN). Perhaps the pathos run a bit thick, but the movie is a moving experience despite that. Based on a true story. Worth a watch."
5,great movie i cannot say enough!,wow so powerful and wonderfully acted i could not take my eyes off of it
5,GOOD MOVIE,I received this DVD in the mail promptly and in good condition. I gave this DVD to my sister for a gift and she loved it. Thank you.
4,Good movie,"It's a movie, just like the one I saw on tv. What else can I say about a dvd to fill this minimum wording needed?"
5,The way they were,"A quick, enjoyable read. This book takes you on the buses, in the dugouts and clubhouses and puts you at the next table in the fast food restaurants frequented by todays major league stars before they made it to the big show. Leinweaver and Bradley capture the essence of minor league life as told in the first person by the guys that lived it. It's funny, sad, sometimes poignant but always entertaining. Don't miss the Piazza story. Overall, great stuff."
1,Minor Moments Major Disappointment,"Read this thing in about 2 hours. One of the most boring books on baseball ever written. All you have to know is that minor leaguers get long bus rides, bad food, and horrible housing. Other than that, not much happened...at least that's the way the author tells it. Nothing funny. Nothing exciting. Nothing at all. The stories are so short, it looks like he interviewed them while standing next to them at a stall in the bathroom. ""Psst. Tell me something quick."" Don't waste your money buying it. Don't even borrow it. Take a nap instead."
4,Fabo,"This book was recommended on my local radio station when reviewing local places to walk, near Washington DC. It is a fun little book and full of useful info."
1,Yuck,"I had high hopes for this product since it had such high reviews from others. I follwed the instructions, but unfortunately I found it inedible and everyone who tried it agreed."
4,good read,"This book was easier to read than most books I've read on the SAS. Not as much UK slang and what is used is easy to understand. I would have enjoyed more detail on the actual missions and less description on the surroundings, but overall good spec ops book."
3,truth be told,very interesting story about true heroes. I thought the US was the only ones with the Special Forces. I thinkthere is a lot more to the story that could be told but for security reasons it had to be left out..
4,Measure Width & Length,"I read all the reviews and one said be sure to measure well I did, however I forgot to measure front to back forgetting about the turning.You need a big microwave."
1,Buyer beware-Not as shown!,"I bought this because the picture shows that is has multiple groups of five holes around the top which would allow great ventilation while heating....not so. I just has a couple a slits (about 1"") in the top and as your food warms it sweats and drips. I would not recommend this product."
5,Good.,This is a good product. This is a lot of required writing for a plastic microwave cover. Duck duck goose.
5,One of those things I had been meaning to buy...,I have wanted to buy a microwave cover for the last year now. I never remember when I go to the store though. Thank goodness Amazon offered one as an add on. Keeps my microwave clean and it's very sturdy. The price wasn't terrible. Would recommend for anyone with a microwave.
5,Large Microwave cover,"I had never even thought of this larger size cover before. I usually used the regular one and if I had too much food on my plate to microwave, I would just have to clean the cover after heating the plate, not any more!"
4,Washing,"This is NOT dishwasher safe. According to packaging, it states to ""hand wash in soapy water.""The product is great but please be aware of this fault in description."
4,Does what you expect,"I would have given this five stars if it didn't say ""love it"" on that choice and you can't really love a microwave cover regardless of how good it is. This products does exactly what it is supposed to and does so at good price so if you are looking for a microware cover get this one. Quality seems to be good with no sharp edges or plastic leftovers."
5,Nordic Ware Spatter Cover,"I bought two of these and they work really well. I haven't washed them in the dishwasher yet, but if I choose to do so, I don't anticipate any problems. There seems to be plenty of space beneath the cover for what you are re-heating. Those who have complained about them not being tall enough must really be heaping the food up. The only problem I ever had was once after heating up a plate of leftovers, there was a lot of hot condensation under the lid, and when I took the cover off, some ran out of one of the vent holes unto my wrist. Call it a learning experience. Other than that, the price was good, they work well, and they are made here. So what's not to like? Five stars."
5,Spatter Cover,Simple product but it works great for the intended purpose. It sure saves on having to clean up splatters. This size fits over full plates or over bowls. Should have bought one a long time ago.
4,NordicWare Splatter Cover,"It's OK for the money, I think. Not as deep as I expected, handle is little slippery when you touch with wet fingers. You can buy the same stuff everywhere in Walmart for $2.00"
5,"Fast delivery,good product and price.",It works! cover whatever you are warming and it catches the splatter instead of the microwave. Wipe it once in a while and your microwave stays clean.
5,No more splatters,"This fits over 11 inch dinner plates, survives nightly washes in the dishwasher and allows enough steam through the vents that my microwave ""auto"" reheat sensor correctly gauges the temperature of the food under the cover. Win!"
4,Does its job good buy,"This does exactly what its suppose to and the price is better than local. Good buy, durable, easy to clean."
2,Spatter Cover,Spatter cover was supposed to fit the Nordic Ware bacon cooker. Unfortunately it doesn't have a tight fit and slides right off from the bacon cooker.
4,Decent size,"It doesn't fit perfectly over my plate like you would hope, but it does cover the majority of a regular sized dinner plate. Food cooks faster and doesn't dry out like it would without the splash cover. Finally I can stop scrubbing the inside of the microwave and just have 1 simple thing to clean! I'd recommend this to anyone!"
4,Serves Our Purpose,"This microwave cover suits our purpose and is more convenient than placing another plate or bowl on top of the plate in the microwave. My only complaint is that the small grab handle in the top of the cover is not deep enough to grab with two fingers, so you always have to use two hands to remove the cover. Otherwise, a good product and good value for the money."
5,Great microwave cover,"This is a great cover when reheating in the microwave. It keeps the splatters from messing up the inside of the microwave. It does build up steam under the cover, so there may be drops of water inside the microwave which are easily wiped up. The cover can get kind of warm, so be careful when removing it. All in all I really like this item."
3,"shorter than expected, handle dips in food","this is shorter than expected but I guess it's my fault for not paying attention to the dimensions, so the 3 stars are not for the height but for the design of the handle. It's indented which makes it dip into the food I am trying to heat and when this food is something liquid it makes a mess and I have to wash it after every single use. Also a little overpriced, as other reviewers said you can get this cheaper at a store."
3,Subpar Quality Control,"I like the product, and it does the job, but final inspection was inadequate. There are 3 slots in the top to let steam escape. Two of the slots were filled with plastic and hadn't been properly opened. Quality control should have caught this before shipping. Nordic Ware has a good reputation, and is made in the USA. Too bad this slipped through."
1,Ripped Off,"I paid $7.13 for this, it's now $4 something. Of course, I ordered this weeks ago. I only ordered it because it said BPA free, however there is nothing whatsoever stating that on the product itself. Amazon says top-rack dishwater safe, the product says hand wash only. So, besides being overcharged and misinformed, I guess I have nothing to complain about."
5,Great product,Love the design - clear to use as a cover on the table for food waiting on someone and good handle to easily remove from hot food in the microwave.
2,Badly warped & returned,"I already had one old splatter cover, but needed a new one and a backup for when the first was dirty.This one arrived badly warped - it wouldn't sit properly, so it didn't contain the splatter..."
4,joshanjoe,Product as described. This keeps my microwave oven clean. Little pricey when compared to Walmart. I will give rating 5 If I get the product with less price.
4,Gets the job done,This is what I expected and it definitely gets the job done. I had seen some collapsible covers before that seemed cool but were a little pricier but now that I think of getting this one out of the way sometimes it may have been worth it.
4,A good tight-sounding string,"Well, it's the first time I've ever replaced a set of double ball-end strings and I can tell you, it IS as easy as they say it's gonna be!No winding string ends round the posts and chopping them off, no slippage, no extra pair of hands needed.But anyway, this is supposed to be a review of the strings, not the double ball-end system, so I'll just say that these Rotosounds are bright and punchy. I'm using them on my Hohner B2ADB and they sound great, even when I lower the E string to C# or D."
2,Sad and very Depressing,"I think Ansay is a fair enough writer, I have only read this one book, so I'm not sure on her style. But this book just left me sad and depressed. I could see the truth in the book, where there are actual people who have lived similar lives. The father-in-law in this book was so awful and evil. It just made me want to reach in it and shake him around for all of the pain he caused his family. I may try another one."
4,"great book, poor illustrations","The patterns are explained clearly and concisely. The authors made sure to make the projects quite interesting. But the illustrations (not photos) of the finished items definitely leaves something to be desired. I wish somebody would update this book, complete with photos.I do recommend this book, but it would be much better with photos."
1,HORRIBLE,"Leather started ""breaking up"" or peeling or separating, not even sure how to describe it, from the center part of the belt. Looked like this leather was ""painted"" on top of the center part. Buckle also started getting covered in some weird spots. I have about 9 belts, and this is the only one ""acting"" weird. Stopped wearing it weeks after getting it. Definitely do NOT recommend."
4,Pretty Good,The staples came just a little broken up but they were still a pretty good deal for the price. Thanks.
1,Got Robbed!,"I ordered a Arrow Fastener ETFX 50 Heavy Duty Professional Electric Staple + Nail Gun, 2 boxes of staples (different sizes), and Berry's #1 staple remover for an Upholstery class. I ordered all of the items at the same time with 1-click. The next day when I reviewed the order I noticed that every item was being sent by different vendors, EACH charging me shipping! $6.04 for the staple remover, 7.16 and 6.84 for each box of $4 staples, and 9.99 for the electric stapler. For a grant total of $30.03 is shipping & handling. When I tried to cancel the order It was already to late. VERY VERY POOR Amazon, and you vendors.People, dont do what I did and not check who was sending out your items....I just assumed it was all from Amazon."
5,Great book!,"This book is not about quick fixes for life issues you may be having. It's a holistic overhaul of how you view life in general. It's not easy, but if you use the lines of thinking Art puts forth in this book, it's much easier to have a more fulfilling life."
3,Remedy worked pretty well for powdery mildew on dahlias,"Every fall I get powdery mildew on my dahlias. I have tried some organic remedies in the past with no luck. I tried Remedy after doing a little online research. I did two applications about a week apart as per instructions. I had one bed full of plants with quite a bit of mildew on them. While it did not entirely remove all of the mildew, Remedy did work well to get rid of most of it. And it seems to me that all the other plants I sprayed that did not have mildew yet have still not been hit with it at all. By now it would have spread to every plant in all three beds. This stuff is a bit caustic, so I wore rubber gloves, goggles and a respirator. I'm really sensitive to chemicals, so I wanted to protect myself."
2,Politically Correct Journalistic Explanation of Human Genetic Diversity,"As mentioned in previous reviews, this is a politically correct journalist tackling human genetic diversity. At a minimum I anticipated a scientific review of the latest research in the field, a survey of recent findings. Instead I was subjected to an endless barrage of Mr. Olson's opinions, and I do emphasize the word opinions, on the genetics of race. I would expect an experienced science writer to at least make an attempt to separate his opinions from scientific fact...no such luck here. Save your money and purchase a book written by a ""real scientist."""
2,A politically correct explanation of human genetic diversity,"This book was advertised as one that debunks myths about human ancestry. What that means is that it systematically discredits the idea of races, arguing that all of us are the products of mixed genetic inheritances. That point is worth making once, but not over and over again as Olson does. After a few chapters, the reader feels as if he (or she) is being lectured by a politically correct journalist. In the end, the effect is counterproductive."
2,A weak imitation,"It is conventional wisdom that good books are written by good writers, and that understanding of the subject is of secondary importance. This book is a disproof of that conventional wisdom.Mr. Olson is a fine writer, but he is not a scientist. Within the first 50 pages he has spent 2 pages on an incorrect explanation of an important genetic concept.Give me instead the real McCoy: Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza is a scientist with true insight. His book, ""Genes, Peoples, and Languages"" is beautifully inspired. He truly understands what he is writing about; and the most interesting elements of Mr. Olson's book are better handled in (if not derived from) Dr. Cavalli-Sforza's book.Mr. Olson, by contrast, is a layman who doesn't quite comprehend that about which he writes. He is the blind leading the blind; and most of his readers don't know the difference, apparently including the nominating committee for the National Book Award."
1,Silly theories.,"For starters. How do Australian Aborigines whose ancestors have lived nowhere but in Austrailia for the last 6,000 years possibly descend from Abraham, the Jewish founding father, who was supposed to have lived just 4,000 years ago in the Middle East? Yet Olson, in his book, ridiculuosly claims all human beings descend from that Abe if he in fact really existed. Fatter than fat chance of all humans being that particular Jewish patriarch's descendants even if he once did exist. Other silly ideas abound in this book. Pass on it!"
5,Excellent book,This book delivers. It is a thoroughly enjoyable exposition of whence we came. I particularly enjoyed the chapter on Jewish genetics. I had no previous how thoroughly the ancient past is still very much with us.
2,Not enough hard facts or analysis,"I was expecting something closer to the 'Seven Daughters of Eve'. Unfortunately, there was very little in the way of what the title promised, that is, a genetic map of how humans migrated throughout the world. There was some discussion, but nothing new.Also way too much of the book was wasted on hand-wringing about the evils of racism. Although, I'm sympathetic to his point of view, that discussion is better placed in a political science book."
2,Unfulfilled Promise,"Mr Olson's book starts out extremely well, but sags after a few chapters. The initial segments on mitonchondrial DNA and our genetics is probably the most readable and understandable treatment that I have seen. About halfway through the book, however, Olson stops trying to trace human migration and development. His emphasis becomes avoiding rascism. At this point, the history and science dwindles away and the emphasis becomes how intermixed our gene pools are. It was almost as if his underlying motivation was a desire to use science to prove a political position. It became rather pedantic at this point. I was very disappointed after the strong start that the book made."
3,A very interesting book,"This book was very easy and enjoyable to read, especially considering how much I learned from it. I didn't particularly like the section on linguistics - the evidence seems much too flimsy to form theories. Otherwise, it's a really neat book."
3,Hitting the road,"Humphreys relates a cross-country trip he took in 1961 taking back roads and going through small towns. He begins near Sandy Hook, NJ, on the Atlantic and ends at Pt. Lobos, CA, near Monterey, on the Pacific. (The ritual of keeping some Atlantic Ocean water in a container and dumping it in the Pacific is foiled somewhere in PA when he learns the pop bottle in which his sample is kept sprung its cork and the water evaporated.) Only 200 pages long, too much of the book reads like an itinerary of towns passed through; once in a while he stops to talk to local residents, but not often enough. The author has a sense of the landscape over which he passes, but not much of a deep feeling for it. Humphreys is also a photographer and the book contains three large sections of typical small-town photographs. Quite a few years later William Least Heat-Moon made a similar trek and wrote BLUE HIGHWAYS, which I thought was more interesting and compelling than this book."
5,A great country album.,"Here's a great follow up to Lacy's debut album.'Hard times' her second album released in 1982 is an all around good set!Three songs charted from this release, there here and there B-sides.1. 'Hard times' B/W 'Old soldier' - top ten hit in 1980.2. 'Hillbilly girl with the blues' B/W 'Me 'n you' - top ten hit in 1980.3. 'Whisper' B/W 'Chins doll' - top ten hit in 1981.The other four tracks are:'Ain't nobody who could do it like my daddy could''You can't fool love''Wide eyed and willing''The girls from Santa Cruz.This is another great set of country music.Lacy's voice and style here are in their prime.This is good easy listening country music."
1,Do not buy,"Took about two weeks to receive and once they arrived they were scratched and flemsy. Also, I ordered another pair from the same poeple, the black tweezers, and they were rusted."
5,Exceeded Expectations,The workouts are workable and enjoyable. Karen Voight has a talent for creating the right workouts to suite different levels without compromising on the benefits.
3,Good and Bad,"I have the Soft Case from a time. The quality is good, very soft, very compact. Only the single thing bad is that the side zipper doesn't open more and it is dificult to thake out the camera. Most of the time the lens cover come down. Because it is compact, also, when u have use fixed at the beld, will be very dificult to put back the camera in."
5,I love it,"Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S1 IS, S2 IS, and G6 CamerasI bought it with the camera and have been using it for more than six months, I like it very much, it is not heavy, it protects the camera very well. it protected my camera in my luggage when i was flying overseas. that is good enough for me to be happy with it :)"
2,It is good but do not buy with cannon S5 IS,"Case is good but dont buy with Cannon S5 Is as it is too small to hold cannon S5 Is. it would be wastage of money if, you buy it for cannon S5 Is."
2,"Nice, tiny no-frills bag","I ordered this to go with the new Canon S5 IS camera I bought, because I thought a new bag would be great. This one is listed as made for the S5, but it isn't. It's too small to be comfortable. I will continue to use my existing camera bag, but am keeping this one for the times when I need a little extra cushioning or have space constraints. I call it workable, but not recommended."
1,Beware: - This case is not for Canon S5 - IS.,"I bought this Case, as it was mentioned as an Accessory for my Canon S5-IS.This case is so small that my Canon wont fit into it.Whoever said that this was a case for Canon S5-IS, guys please read the reviews before buying it, I did a big mistake by buying it."
3,average for Canon S2 IS camera,I'll rate this product as average. I'm satisfied by its look and safety wise but my canon s2 is camera is just fitting it. There is no space to keep extra batteries & memory card. I would've become more satisfied if there would've been some slots to keep the extra batteries & memory slot. Otherwise it is just ok.
3,Does not have a shoulder strap,I bought this item and only then found out that it does not come with a shoulder belt. It only has a belt strap. The bag is just big enough to hold Canon Powershot S2-IS and can not take in any other accessories. I just decided to return it.
3,Okay,This product looks good and compact for my S2 IS. It is little expensive and very compact. does not have any extra space to place extra batteries etc. Not so useful if you want to carry extra batteries/charger or SD card
5,excellent,"this case is excellent. its primary purpose is to protect the camera. exactly fits the camera. i guess they didnot provide the slots for batteries because, they wanted to make the bag small and easy to carry. you can also carry the camera using the neck strap. and this is perfect for that and very stylish. i would highly recommend for a s2 or s3"
3,Review of soft case for Canon camera,"The case is a minimal carrying case. I would recommend a slightly larger case with room for some other items [even very small items]. plus, the way the case is made it zips up from the sides and does not really close around the camera except for a velco attachment at the top. its both unhandy and not very secure."
2,Disappointed,"This case is useful only for carrying the camera - and it is not enclosed to keep out the weather, dust, rain, ice cream drips, etc. It has no practical space to carry spare batteries, spare memory, etc. Look around first."
3,Cramped!!,"Although the quality of the case is nice it does not fit my S3 IS comfortably, i have to push my cam inside and also make an effort to take it out as well. And during all this pushing and shoving the lens cover keeps falling out. SO i would suggest people to go for better alternatives with a little more inside space."
2,Not Big enough for the Canon S2 IS,I saw some reviews about this case being small . I thought it was a good thing as i was trying to save space anyway but i did not realize that i would not be able to fit in the camera into the case. I am still trying to close the zipper and case once i have put the camera in and i have not been able to do it . I would not buy this case for the canon S2 IS .
2,Too small...Won't work for Powershot SX20IS,"We bought this case to store our Canon Powershot SX20IS 12.1MP Digital Camera, which by the way is a fantastic camera. This camera does not fit in the case so perhaps I should have done a better job of researching before buying this case.Even still this case is a disappointment. Very little padding or protection for the camera. No place to store anything except very thin memory cards. Forget extra batteries, cables, etc. I also don't like that you have two zippers, one on each side, that don't meet nor go up the whole way on the case. There is a type of velcro cover that tries to account for that. Not a very good design in my opinion. For what it is, a soft case, I think there are better options out there."
2,Tight fit for intended camera,"The camera bag is well shaped to hold the camera, but it takes two hands and some concentration to get the camera in the bag (with the lens cap that keeps falling off) and then uses a Velcro strap to close the bag. Two little zippers then seal the bag. The included camera strap is too big to fit inside the bag, and it hangs down. I attached an extra shoulder strap to the bag to get the balky bag off my belt, and it is not well balanced and one time hung upside down, dropping the camera on a carpeted floor."
4,Fits the S2 perfectly,After reading a lot of reviews I was having doubts when I bought this for my Canon S2. But my camera fits in snug. I don't try to squeeze in batteries or anything else - and I can carry my camera with its own strap. (case doesn't come with a strap)
2,A Never Ready Case,"This is really a very good case for traveling, that is going to and from a vacation spot or place of interest.Using it as a case attached to the camera is totally, useless, very difficult to get the S3 in or out, zippers cannot close, hard to get the camera back into the case, a really clumsy affair.But as I had said, for getting on a plane or a ship or a car and keeping the camera protected it is useful."
2,Disappointed,"Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I was under the impression that the case would at least have room for a spare set of batteries and an additional memory card. Basically it's just a soft wrap for the camera (I bought an S3 IS), which is actually somewhat annoying when removed to take pictures."
4,good price and fit,Great price for a case to protect the camera. I have a bigger case to keep camera stuff in. I bought this case so I could put the camera in a fanny pack for vacationing etc.
5,Canon Soft Case,"There are no frills to this case, just convenient and smart looking. I purchased it for my S2 IS and it is a perfect fit. There are no extra compartments for storage....camera only space."
5,Fits like a glove.,Fits snug with room for maybe another SD card or a set of batteries and really nothing else (there is a little pocket). This is just a carry case and nothing more. Strap stays on the outside. Looks good and fits good. Must put camera in with lens facing out.
4,I might loose my case,An optional neck strap should be available to run through the belt loop on the case.
3,Just a bit too small,"The case is snug. You will need to plan your shots ahead of time. You cannot quickly remove the camera from the bag. The lens cover ""pops off"" whenever you insert/remove the camera. Look for a case that has more room."
4,It's alright...,"It's too bulky to put it on your belt as if it were a pouch --then again, who would volunteer themselves to look that dorky? The bag does offer great protection for your camera and even has a little pocket inside for extra memory cards (SD). Just don't expect it to hold your batteries, too. It has a nice opening convenient enough to take out the camera in the spur of the moment. It also fits the camera nice and snug."
3,"Good quality, bit small",I bought it for my Canon Powershot s5 (as it was offered by Amazon) but it does not fit well.
4,A tight fit...,"The Canon S5 is not huge but bigger than regular point and shoots. I wanted a case that would fit the camera snugly and minimize it's bulk. I do a lot of light hiking and carry my camera on my belt. This case allows me to do that. I also ride a motorcycle and needed a case that would protect the camera from vibration and chaffing. It is a tight fit around the camera, but after using it a few times, you work out a method that simplifies the process. A good choice in cases if your prime concern is bulk."
4,Canon PSC Delux carry case,Great size that comfortablly fits camera. Easy to put in and take camera out. soft and has nice strong zippers. But has no shoulder strap- Bummer.
2,Returned item,I purchased this camera case for my new PowerShot S5IS. After receiving the camera case I decided to send it back unopened as it appears this camera case is better suited for smaller cameras than the PowerShot S5IS.
3,Too small for S5 IS,"I mistakenly assumed that because the case would accomodate and S1 or S2 that it would also accomodate an S5. Although the S5 will fit inside the case, it's a bit too snug, in my opinion. Certainly no room for a spare set of batteries. Seems like a decent quality case, but it doesn't meet my needs."
3,camera case,"I like the soft sided case but it seems too small for the camera. Once the strap is attached, case will not close completely which causes concern that the camera may fall out."
4,Sturdy for what I bought it for.,"I do not have a PSC... I have an A2000 IS. But the case for the A2000 IS is ugly! I need extra room for spare batteries and the coupler ""plate"" to my Dolcia tripod, so I bought this one. I just wanted a Canon case, I spent all that money for non SLR camera with a decent 6X zoom and 10 mpxl... I didn't want a cheap little case. This case is a bit loose even with a camera that fits in it (I tried it on an SLR camera that's about the right size). There's a big gap at the back that allows the zipper to easily come open. The top closes via velcro, so it helps, but one zipper that goes around the entire camera would've been 100 times better than 2 zippers for the sides and a velcro latch for the top.It's sturdy and nicely protects everything inside. Like I said, I wanted a nice ""Cannon"" brand case that didn't cost as much as the camera, and this is currently the best solution to those conditons."
1,size,"per the spec of this case size:5.4x5.1x4.3, but the actual measuredsize is 4.75x4.25x4.5,the spec size is the plastic box size but not the soft case size"
3,Nice bag for the price,"I bought this case for my Powershot A650 and was pretty pleased with the product. The case is nice and soft and offers good protection. There is a small inside pocket that is good to keep extra memory cards or batteries. So far the case is nice and durable and there are no defects.My only complaint about the bag is that it is a little big for the A650 and bulky. Also the only way to carry the bag hands free is to thread your belt through the loop in the back. It would be nicer to just have a belt clip that way you can take it off and on more conveniently.Other than that, the product is good and I would recommend it to a friend."
1,Amazon mis-direction,"I purchased the Canon Powershot S5 IS and Amazon automatically teamed it with this case. It does not fit and is obviously not intended for this camera, what more can I say? It may be a fine case but I cannot use it for my camera.Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for PowerShot S1 IS, S2 IS, and G6"
2,A Bit Too Small,"I bought the camera and case for an upcoming trip. The case is quite small and has the smallest handle/strap on it. You can hook it on your pinky only! Does have a slot where you could wear it on your belt, but not everyone wears a belt! Could carry an extra memory card in it and batteries, which is nice. But need some way to carry it. I could recommend it if you don't mind holding it in your hand ( or off the pinky)."
1,The PSC-75 is NOT for the Canon S5 IS,"I purchased this soft case for my Canon S5 IS. It was for the S5 but when I received, it was obvious that the case was not meant for the S5. Too small. As a matter of fact, the packaging for the case lists the S3, S2 S1 and G6 as being compatible. It does not mention the S5."
3,Good Case,"Although this case is a great fit for the camera and seems to fit the camera nicely, it does not provide a safe location for you camera. This case is small with little padding and does not come with any sort of strap or belt to hold on to. It is ment to be attached to your own belt. I also did not like advertising the type of camera that I had."
2,Average cover for S5 IS,"I bought this cover as a combo deal with Canon Powershot S5 IS. Before that I also checked this case at Canon which claims that this case is meant for the camera.But the case barely fits the camera and is meant only for the camera. Although the camera takes A4 batteries, but do not expect to be able to fit in the batteries or any extra memory card or charger or anything other than the camera itself in the case.Also, putting the camera in the case is very painful. Most often the camera lens lid will keep coming out while putting in and out.Definitely not recommended with a big camera like Powershot S5 IS."
3,Do not buy this for S5 IS,"I bought this for my Canon S5 IS and its too small for the camera. Even with the neck strap kept outside, I couldn't close the case. Do NOT buy this for an S5. Iam returning the product back."
2,This case was not designed for the S5,"This case was obviously not designed for the S5. In fact the labeling on the box doesn't even mention the S5. When you realize that the S5 is nearly 10 cubic inches larger than either the G6 or S1, it's clear why it doesn't fit.Another concern is how easily the lens cap pops off when you insert or remove the camera from the bag. Considering the tight fit, it's only a matter of time before the lens coating gets scratched by one of the zippers.In short, this case doesn't properly fit the S5. Can you make it fit, sure, but it's kind of like stuffing your size 10 foot into a size 8 shoe, you can do it, but it's painful! Canon needs to design a new case for the S5."
4,Great if you want only a Camera Carry bag,"I was clear with my requirements. I wanted a camera carry bag just to tuck my Canon Powershot S2 IS between shots in a typical outing. For that this bag is just perfect. Of course it is difficult to pack in another set of AA batteries, but then it is fine in that it reduces the overall weight that I have to carry around my neck. As pointed out, you can leave the neck strap outside. It also has a belt loop."
1,Not for the S5 IS - Even though Amazon recommends it to you!,"This case is small. No, I mean tiny. No, I mean almost not visible! Amazon automatically recommended this to me when I purchased the Canon S IS camera. So I bought it. The camera will not fit inside. The interior is, literally, only as large as my fist. So I returned it with an explanation and asked for the shipping cost back. No such luck. Stay away from this case!"
4,Nice small case,"I wanted a small case for my S2IS, and this fit the bill perfectly. No room for accessories, but it sure beats carrying around a purse-sized bag, or risking your camera getting damaged by not having a case at all. Worth every penny!"
1,Camera Case ALMOST Fits,"This case was sold as an accessory for the Canon S3 IS camera. It takes way too long to stuff the camera in this case to make it user friendly. I basically use it for protection when transporting the camera, but it is never used when carrying and shooting.Just a bit too skimpy."
2,Too small!,"While the case itself is well constructed out of good material and has held up for three years under hard use, it is too small to be convenient. It is a pain to get the camera (S2 IS) in and out. If you're slightly off you have to either remove the camera and try again, or the lens cap falls off and needs to be replaced.This exact case, if only slightly larger, would be perfect."
1,Doesn't fit the S5 IS,"I bought this case for the Canon S5 IS I picked up a few days ago. I just received the case today. I can barely cram the camera into it, and then only if I remove the neck strap. There is a pocket for memory cards, but I'd be afraid the camera body might crush them. I'm sending it back. The product packaging states this is for the S2 IS, S1 IS, and G6, so why is it being advertised for the S5 and S3 here on Amazon?"
5,Nice Case,"This case full completely my requirements, it's looks good, compact, ligthly, and the camera fits in it."
3,Not upto the mark ...,I bought this along with S2 IS. The camera does not fit comfortably in the case.
3,Not much space,"The case has room for the camera and a couple of SD cards, and that is it. I thought it would at least have room for my back-up batteries. It is very stylish and space saving, but not all that functional."
3,Buen diseño pero poco espacio,"Excelente diseño pero no trae para colgarlo del cuello o para colocar unas pilas de repuesto, si carga ropa deportiva sin correa se puede convertir en un fastidio cargarlo"
3,Ok Case,I did not understand the description or did not read it carefully. This deluxe case is simply a cover for the camera with a small pocket for an extra disc. I thought that it might be a bag but it was not. It is of good quality but not what I expected.
2,Ok- but not very useful,"The picture is very misleading. The actual case is just large enough for the camera and nothing else. It is a well made case but I needed something that I could use for the camera, spare batteries, spare SD cards, etc....This is unfortunately one of the problems with buying online as opposed to buying at a brick & mortar where you can actually see and touch the product and weigh its ability to serve your needs."
1,Doesn't fit the S3 IS camera!,"I returned this because although it says it fits the Canon S3 IS, it doesn't. I turned the camera every way but the zippers won't close. Not to mention there is no room for anything else. There is a good Samsonite with extras for $10.00 more."
2,Too little,"The camera case is very good for protecting the camera, but is too small for any additional equipment, like batteries, and instruction book. Nor does it have a handle to carry it. The only way to carry it is with the camera strap, or inside another bag."
2,Camera Case Review,"This is a nice leather case, however it is very small. Not really large enough to hold the camera and the cable. It would also be nice if it had a strap. Wish I had purchased something else."
4,Canon PSC-75 good quality but a little tight,"This case is made well for the price, durable, thoughtfully layed out except for one small detail. The case doesn't really accomodate the strap that comes with my S3IS. If you want to put in just the camera, it fits like a glove. Getting the strap in there if you want to put it in your pack/purse/etc and be snag free, is a squeeze."
2,Delux Soft Case fro PowerShot S5 IS,"This case will only hold the camera, barely. Too small to be very useful and really too large to attach to a belt for carrying purposes. Forget the belt loop and allow for some small storage without overly enlarging the case and it would be more user friendly..."
1,Doesn't fit S5. Returned it back,Bought this case along with Canon S5 IS. Had to return it back as it doesn't fit S5. Hardly could insert it. No place or slot for batteries or space SD card.
2,Too Small!,"I was excited to receive the case to go with my wonderful new Canon S5 IS camera. The description said it works with my camera. When I got it by mail, I immediately tried stuffing the camera in the bag, since I was leaving 2 days later for a vacation. NOT HAPPENING! I could barely put the camera in the case, let alone the strap, extra batteries, etc. This case is WAY too small and appears larger in the picture, for whatever reason. Because it's not the fault of the seller, I didn't return it and will most likely just donate it. Takes too much effort and money to send back or try to sell myself.The seller was very timely and I am impressed with their turnaround between when I bought the case and when I received it. THANK YOU!!!"
2,Soft Case,This camera case does not come with a shoulder strap. I felt this should be a universal accessory for a camera case. It also does not have many pockets to store loose items. I was looking for a small and inexpensive case that my camera would fit into. What I got was a cheap case.
2,Prizzy for the quality,"The Case it is not that good may be if the price was 10 bucks it would be okey, cause the camera doesn't fit that well and the case isn`t that confortable"
5,Canon Carrying Case,Excellent quality and construction. Fits S1 IS series perfectly and protects camera. What more could you want?
2,Canon PSC-75 Isn't a Perfect Fit,"Unfortunately, this camera case was marked as the recommended accessory for the Canon SX100IS camera, that I recently bought from Amazon. I was very disappointed when I received the camera case and found that is was significantly larger than the Canon camera. In addition, the is no carrying strap included, so you are more or less forced to attach the large case to your belt.The only plus is that the camera case is definitely high quality materials and construction."
2,It woulb be ok with a strap and extra pocket,"The Canon PSC-75 soft case look nice, but I do not recommend it. It is ok for my Canon SX 100 IS, it has a small pocket inside for memory cards, but do not have a pocket for the extra batteries. I am a woman, I do not wear belt so, I need a strap!!!"
2,The picture is misleading,"The case looks like it has a couple of compartments for separate storage of batteries, connection cables, etc. But, it doesn't, it's just one pocket that requires 3 steps to open and close... Not functional."
1,Read the reviews- Don't buy for an S3 or S5!!!,"As others have recently stated in their reviews, Amazon recommends you buy this with the Canon S5 IS. This bag is too small for that camera to fit. It is supposed to be a tight fit for the S1 and S2, but the newer cameras are bigger and simply will not fit. I am returning this bag."
5,a great accessory,This case is great for carrying the camera around your neck. It is just the right size. It holds an extra SD card and will hang from the camera lens cover cord when taking pictures. A good buy.
3,The camera is better than the case,"The camera is really good, but the case could be better!I have had difficulties in handling the case, especially when putting thne camera in, since the lense hood often comes off while pushing the camera into the case. The zippers often get stuck with the cord that holds the hood of the lense, and I have not yet found a way to store the camera's neck strap in the case when it is strapped to my belt. There is no space in the case for extra batteries either!The plus side is good craftmanship, nice materials and a compact case."
5,Camera Case,"This fits the camera perfectly. However, it looks bigger in the picture. I thought it would hold some accessories as well as the camera, but it doesn't. If you want room for anything but the camera, buy a different case."
4,"Nice case, but a bit small","This is a nice case, it fits the camera perfectly.Almost too perfectly for my taste, there is barely room to get extra memory cards or your transfer cord into the case with the camera. If you are looking for something to just hold your camera like a glove, then this is for you, if you are expecting extra storage space, pick another case."
4,Delux Soft Case Opinion,"This case fits the camera like a glove, is attractive, and feels smooth and soft. It has an inside pocket for storage of extras. However, the case is too tight to store an extra set of batteries and memory card without stuffing them in. This makes me worry that the memory card my get damaged. Further, the zippers on both sides of the case will not zip to the end of their run on the top of the case. They only zip to the top of the sides leaving the the top somewhat open."
3,Decent but Tiny,"I can't stress this enough: READ REVIEWS! I got this hopeing it would protect my camera AND give me a place for spare batteries. Sadly, I have to report that while it does the first, it doesn't take care of the second. I guess I was looking for more of a ""camera bag"" and got this case. There is barely room inside to carry a spare memory card, much less batteries. If you want something to help you carry a few extras (as most people do) then get something else.On a final note, the case does seem to protect the camera well and is fine for that if that is all that you want."
4,Very nice case,"This is a very nice case. The leather seems of fairly good quality and the back has a wide loop to attach to your belt which is nice. There is a small pocket on the back side. It's good to hold one or two SD cards, however the fit gets tight if you are looking to hold extra batteries. I give it a 4 only because I wish there was room to hold more batteries since Digi cams love to go through them."
1,"poorly designed, NO WAY TO ATTACH A STRAP","What kind of idiot would design a camera case that not only does not come with a strap, but CANNOT BE ATTACHED TO A STRAP? I feel stupid for ordering this. The case is not form-fitting, it is a generic bag that more or less fits the IS, but only if you use both hands to add/remove it from the bag. The bag is emblazoned with a pointless logo. The bag has a velcro strap and TWO zippers, all three must be opened before removing the camera, and all three must be closed to secure the camera. There is NO thought behind this product, it is a complete waste of time and space. Canon should be ashamed."
1,Canon PSC-75 Soft Case,"Too small! No room for anything but the camera. Order, through Amazon, a Tamrac Explorer DSLR camera bag #BOOOEOUYHG which gives you room for camera with lens extender, filters and a whide angle lens such as Raynox DCR - 720"
4,Good Case - no storage,"This case is fine IF you have the Camera Strap attached to the Camera - the loop on the case ""loops"" on to that.It's nice enough for protecting the camera - there's just enough room for an extra memory card.I think I'd prefer a wrist strap to the neck one - which always feels too hot to me in the Summer."
1,Way too small,The case is extremely small and does not provide space for batteries. The strap also does not fit inside the case and hence doesn't provide elegant storage. Extremely disappointing!!!
1,Pretty near useless,"I have one. Wish I could remember why. It has too many openings to protect the camera from weather. It still blocks access to any controls. It hangs awkwardly on your belt. I really should give it to Goodwill or the Salvation Army. I will not sell mine, I don't want to be associated with such a useless item.However, it indeed is soft, and kind of nice looking.I am WAY over the age of 13."
1,Poor case!!!!!,"This is not a good accesory for your IS camera. It's too small, there is not strap, no extra pockets for your batteries or cards. I'm really dissapointed with this product."
3,NOT for the S5 (as Amazon said.),"I realize that Canon makes no claim for this case being for the S5, however, Amazon listed it as an accessory. I assumed since they listed this case and no other, that this one would work.The S5 does sort of fit the case, but not perfectly, and it tends to knock the lens cover loose if you try. It's a nice looking case and I'm sure it's great on the cameras listed. I just wanted to warn anyone who might also think it is an accessory. I'm not going to bother returning it, as it was cheap enough and I can use it until I find something else."
2,Way Too Small,"I love my Canon S5, and bought this case with my camera, but am returning the case because it is not big enough to hold four spare AA batteries. I opted to instead buy a Lowepro Edit 110 case that is still small but not as small as the PSC-75."
1,pretty much useless,"The case is very small and the camera, by itself, barely fits in it. The case doesn't seem to have any real purpose."
2,Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case,The camera case has to be strapped to ones belt. There are no long external straps to place over ones shoulder or carry it by hand. This is not a good design for a camera case as the case is too large and the camera and case would be too heavy to be supported by ones trouser's belt.
2,"sorry, I'm not impressed :-(","I'm sorry to say we were extremely disapointed in the camera case. we could barely get the camera in, but what good is the camera and case when you can't even put in the cords, and even a place for the extra memory cards? We bought the camera for my holidays, but we will have to go buy a real case! our old case was small and compact, but had pockets and compartments to keep all the 'gear' in one place, and the batteries, you ALWAYS need extra batteries and memory cards when you are in a different country.and the mini tripod stand, and when we opened this box, and saw this piddly little thing, I have seen thongs larger than this camera case! so I am sorry to say 1 star. that's only because we didn't want to hurt your feelings, we were happy with the rest of the items..."
1,To small,This bag is big and however too tight for this camera.And very unpractical to fit the camera into it.i wasted my monesI would not reccoment it.
3,Not fits that well S5.,"I am not sure about other models, S5 does not fit that well. To insert the camera into the bag is an effort as such. Does not have even one pocket to keep your memory card. Can be used when only you are hard pressed for space in a small piece luggage when you travel. For safety sake it is better to go for bigger one."
2,A little too small,This item fit the camera like a glove. there is no room for extra set of batteries or anything else. Also I did't like the way it opens.
3,Goes well with the camera,I am so happy with the Camera that the bag does not matter. It goes well with the camera (powershot IS S2)and thats about it. Fits perfectly so dont expect to even carry extra batteries in this.
2,Well built but useless,Don't waste your money. This little bag is well constructed and will protect your camera but there is no room for anything else like extra batteries or memory cards. I wound up buying a larger bag very quickly after trying this loser.
4,this is perfect to put on your belt,might be to small for some I have two bags and took this one for my belt to keep my hands free.
2,Barely Adequate,"I rate this case as barely adequate because it just barely protects the camera. The camera can't be completely enclosed in the case since the camera's carrying strap hangs out and any shock protection it provides is minimal. It doesn't fit well. From the side, it seems to have a triangular design, though how that fits a roughly rectangular camera body is beyond me. The camera has to be manuvered around to get it inside. If the case was built for this set of cameras, they should fit right in. It is hard to get the camera inside without knocking off the lens cap. There isn't enough space provided even for an extra set of batteries, although there is enough room for an extra memory card (woopie). A couple of extra side compartments would have been useful. I'm sure I can find a generic bag that will be more useful, but I shouldn't need to after buying Canon's custom bag especially designed for this set of cameras."
3,Tight fit - lacking pockets to carry some items,It fits the camera tight. I could barely close it. I would have liked a design that could carry those small handy tripods. I have a flexable 3-4 inch long tripod. I could carry with my previous camera bag with the camera. This bag doesn't allow that.Other than that it is a OK built bag and sturdy enough for daily use.
2,Not big enough,I would have loved to have a bag which can hold a set of spare battries as well as a spare memory card. This bag is too small to hold spare battries and doesn't have any pockets.
3,"Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S1 IS, S2 IS review","Although amazon recommends this case for my s5 IS, this case is a little tight for this camera. Since the camera lens cap comes off easily, the cap often comes off when I tried to fit the camera in. No space for spare batteries."
2,Not a good choice,"The case looked fine on the photos but it is just too small for the camera.(S5IS) It will fit, but it is very difficult to get it all the way into the case and hard to close. It is then almost impossible to get it out of the case quickly. Also there is not enough room for extra batteries or for that matter not even an additional memory card. Inexpensive but not worth it."
2,Camera case,"It is a bit small for the S5--it is difficult getting the camera in the case without the lens cap popping off. I actually bought a larger case for traveling. It also doesn't have a strap of its own, so there is no way to hold on to it when you are using the camera."
2,Not happy with it,"The camera just fits in without leaving much room for the extra batteries or the cable. These are usually the things you want to keep with the camera. Moreover it isnt even water proof. In the image it looks as if it has a zip running all along the opening but it is not so and the top is protected just by a flap. Also I do not like wearing it with my belt so every time I take the camera out, it hangs from the camera strap with a small tight loop that is fastened by a button. If I unfasten it I have to carry it along, and if I keep it on, it really is a hindrance.I think they could do a better job with the design."
2,Not so good,I was disappointed with the soft case. I would have liked it to have:1. A long strap so that one can hang the case with the camera on one's shoulder.2. A little more space so that the user manual of the camera can be taken alongI bought Powershot S3 1S and I am perfectly happy with the camera. But not with the soft case.
2,"Compact bag, no shoulder strap","I had expected a shoulder strap for this bag. Unfortunately, only had a belt-loop (the kind that you would have to wear with the belt).The case is just right for the camera. Not ideal, if you want the camera for a quick snap.I returned it back to Amazon within a week. Lost some shipping charges in the process.Instead, I got a much better case from SonySony LCS-VAC Soft Carrying Case for most Sony MiniDV, DVD & HDD Camcorders"
3,too small,Although the quality of the product is good. The sizemakes it difficult to use easily.Canon Deluxe Soft Leather Case PSC-75
2,Expensive protection,"As noted by the previous reviewer, this case offers only protection for the camera, with space only for a memory chip and no strap. With a strap and slightly larger, a winner, but as is, I suggest a Tamrac #3 SLR case."
5,Great Compact Case,"First note: for those saying ""this case does not have a strap""...you are correct it doesn't. I was frustrated about this at first...but then realized that the CAMERA strap is the strap!It's a pretty cool design, really. The camera (S2) fits quite nicely, pull the strap out, zip the two zippers and close the flap and you can carry it around by the camera strap.I have plenty of space for the camera with 4 AA batteries and an extra memory card in the rear internal pouch. (yes, it has an internal pouch and I can easily fit 4 batteries in it).It's solid, offers a decent amount of protection, and it's COMPACT. If you are hoping to carry any camera accessories beyond extra batteries and an extra SD card, you should look for another case."
2,Not the best choice,"The bag is nice, but not a good use of space, pockets are closed and the bag can not carry anything else the the camera, not even a space for 4 extra batteries. They could have done better making this."
5,Perfect Fit for Canon Powershot S3 IS,"Contrary to some reviewers, this case accommodates my Canon Powershot S3 IS perfectly. Yes, it is a snug fit but it was designed to enclose only the camera. What about the camera strap? I keep it attached but hang it outside the closed zippered case. If you need to stow the included camera strap and accessories, then a camera bag would be the solution. A camera case is not a camera bag. My suggestion for anyone searching for this case, if it becomes unavailable, is to retain it in your ""Wish List."" Check on its status periodically. You may be surprised, as I had, when it becomes available."
5,S5 IS perfect,"This is a perfect fit for the S5 IS. It fits snugly and protects my camera so I can just throw it into a handbag or backpack without worrying that it will get scratched. There is no room for batteries or anything else. It is more of a protective covering than a case, which is exactly what I wanted. I love the fact that it is leather. It's held up well, still looks great after 2 years of trekking."
5,It does what it suppose to do,"I have Canon S3 IS camera and this case works perfectly. You can actually take your camera out with just one hand (and not have to go through 3-step process as some reviewers are saying) - just open the top, and with two fingers open the zippers (they open so easily) and grab your camera - 2 sec!You also have a small pocket to fit extra memory card, but I am pretty good at keep my card 'low' (and I would never go out on a big trip w/ full memory card). As far as the batteries goes, rechargeable batteries are soo good, I can take 100's of pictures in just one charge, so there is no need to carry extra batteries in this camera bag. If you go on vacation or something, you would bring your charger too and it can't fit in the camera bag - so just leave extra batteries to charge while you are out taking pictures with freshly charged batteries and empty memory card. This little bag actually does what it suppose to, and it is not to replace your carry on baggage!"
3,hu-hummm...,i like that it fits my canons3 is nicely but it can be quite bulky to take with no spare room at all even for the sd cards....
1,Not for an S5 IS!,"This case does NOT hold an S5 IS camera. It is way too small and it cannot be closed or pushed in no matter how hard you try. Unfortunately, I received it the night before I left on a trip and just threw it in my suitcase. After arriving at my destination and opening it, putting the plastic packaging in the hotel wastebasket, I discovered it did not fit, but the trash had been removed. I can't even return it for a refund now."
3,too small for me,Bought it for my S5IS....fits like a leotard...couldn't fir another thing...not practical. Sorry I bought it.
3,Barely fits S5 IS,"Though S5 IS is listed among supporting products, the case barely fits the camera. There are no additional pockets for carrying anything extra like cells. If you just need a case for the camera, go for this. But if you use the camera for long durations, like I do, and need to carry backup cells, go for something bigger."
2,Camera case is a tight fit for the S5 IS,This is a nice case but I found my Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom is a very tight fit in this case. I was also disappointed that there wasn't much storage in it for extra batteries and memory cards.
3,camera case,"This case did not fit the camera that we bought. The case was offered as an accessory, but did not fit the camera to which it was offered. However, we had an old camera that did fit in the case. For that camera, it was very nice."
1,Way too small,"This was a ""pop up"" when I ordered Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom. Assuming that it was the correct item, because it was ""recommended""...I also purchased it without really thinking about it....it was a rip off...way too small for the camera. Basically, I was jilted out of my money.....I warn all users of Amazon to NOT buy this ""forced feed crap"". Because I ordered it, I guess it was my fault. ..I just threw it away as a piece of junk...but I will not use Amazon again. Buyer beware. I learned my lesson. Not worth the hassel of wrapping and sending it back, and they knew that. It was a rip-off, internet style."
2,"Fashionable Yes, Functional No","I have to agree with the consensus here, it's too small for the average user. Unless you plan on carrying your extra set of batteries in another bag, I would stay away. Hence, I'm returning mine."
2,I returned it,Its frankly not what I envisioned.. Its too small for the camera if you get a lens adaptor which frankly is the smart thing to do for ease of handling and lens protection.. Even without the lens adaptor it does not come with a strap and also does not zip up that well.I frankly would skip it and get a bigger one.
1,Fits the Canon S5? - IN YOUR DREAMS!,"This case was recommended for the Canon S5, which I bought as a gift for my wife. The case is 30% undersized for this camera. I could shove it in, but there was no way I could zip it up.Find a bigger case if you order the S5."
2,Canon PSC75 case review,According to the Canon site this camera bag is supposed to fit a Canon S5 IS and it doesn't. I had bought a small bag at Walmart and thankful I did. The quality of the product is just fine but will not fit the Canon S5 IS. So do not purchase it for that camera. As it was cheap I just gave it away.
2,Nearly useless,"If absolutely the only thing you need is to protect your cam when placing it in a larger bag, then this case might suffice for you. The S5 just barely fits in it, and only after tedious squeezing and positioning. Then you have to zip up each side and finally Velcro the top. Not a quick or easy process. You can probably get an extra memory card into the inner pocket, but really, I wouldn't even risk that - the fit is that tight. No shoulder strap, and I'd like to meet the person who lugs one of these hefty cams around by his belt loop.I'll be returning this and getting a normal bag. Bad judgment on my part, should have read the reviews more carefully. I just assumed that since it was made for the S series it would be useful."
2,Better Cases That Do More,I Like factory Accessories when Possible to match a Quality Product But was Disappointed with this. Canon Could Do Better. It Only Holds the camera Little else. It does Not Have any usable storage space and there are Better Choices for what this Canon Case Costs. Save Your Money and Go Into a Discount retailer with Your camera trying Out the Many Cases available. I assure you this is Not the answer to Carry Your Nice Canon Camera in. If You Want a Camera case that Says Canon PowerShot On It then this is for You. Disappointing and Gave It away to a Friend who had the Same Camera.
3,I love it but my daughter doesn't!,"I was really drawn to the G Galore pattern. Its soothing earthtones fit into the decor of our home. In addition, it has everything you could want in a swing. It is durable and easily cleaned. The seat has adjustable recline, vibration, it has removable extra padding and a head positioner (perfect for young infants, yet easily detached once they gain better head control) It sings songs, makes nature sounds, has various speed settings, a timer. It has a tray, attachable toys a mobile. Graco really thought of everything. Now if only my daughter would swing in it! She is 6 mos, we have had it since birth and she rarely will tolerate it longer than 10 minutes. Oh well, better luck with the next kid."
3,I own this swing...,"Its ok, my little buddy enjoys it. I do not like how the tray snaps down into place. I would think it would be a little easier than that. And it is somewhat noisy compared to the one I used w/ my daughter. (sorry its been years and I do not remember the brand)."
3,Own this,"My son has this swing in the Moonstruck pattern but he doesn't care for it too much yet. He's only 2 months. At times, he will go in it, but not longer than 10 minutes. He enjoys the nature sounds. If he is upset, instead of losing my breath making shushing sounds, I take him near the swing and play the water sounds and it calms him. He enjoys looking at the bears overhead. I wish he would enjoy it more, hopefully as he gets older."
3,"work with plantronics hands free headset, but expensive","this cable does what it says: allows you to connect plantronics hands-free headset to 2.5mm jacks.it works, but i think the price is way too high cuz its proprietary."
1,direct connect,"found this cable would not fit my phone. Befor you order this to go with a headset check to see if it is compatable. I received it and had to return it the next day. Sadly I had to call Plantronics tech support to find this out. The new quick connect works well, so I am sure this one would have if it had been used. No fault of the connector, but different phones take different cable ends, I bought because it was suggested to go with my new head set, my mistake for not checking."
1,Product stopped working,Had the cord for less than a week and it just stopped working. It allowed me to hear the other person but they couldn't hear me.
5,Works Great!,Works Great! Just plug it in and it worked! Simple as that! I recomemnd anyone use this if it fits your needs correctly.
1,Beware of compatibility issues!,This cord was supposed to allow my Mitel 5215 IP Phone to connect directly to my Plantronics headset but it did not do so. I checked prior to ordering it and it was listed as compatible but it didn't work correctly. If I unplugged the handset it would work in that port but not in the intended headset port. Luckily I was able to return it without a hassle and purchased the Vista M22 amplifier which did allow me to use my headset.
3,Product Good - Shipment Horrible,"What can you say about a box of stables? They're the right size, they fit and seem to work fine in the stable gun - at least the broken up pieces I received. My complaint is with the condition in which they arrived. The small box of stables was thrown in with another order and banged around loosely inside the shipping box. When I open the shipping carton, the stable box was open and broken stables were strewn all over the inside of the container. The entire contents was in pieces. A little scotch tape around the ends of the stable box would have prevented all of this."
5,as described,Works in my light duty stapler. No jamming issues. No issues. Make sure you buy the right width and lenght for your application.
2,"Right Battery, but No Connector","Granted, the picture provided DOES show just two leads and not the actual connector to attach to the motherboard, but there is no indication that I would have to do surgery on it to get it to install. In other words, I had to cut off the connector on the old battery, tin the leads on the battery and the connector, and tape them up with electrical tape to get it to work. If this is a specific battery to this model computer, I don't see why it didn't come with the connector."
1,It's the Wrong Item,This is NOT a substitute for the CMOS battery in my Sony N505VE. Original battery has a modular end and this does not. There is no way to install it. I ended up ordering directly from Sony and was glad to receive an exact match. I have returned the Amazon shipment.
3,Do It Yourself Projects to Create the Swedish Look,"Here are some practical ideas and projects for creating the Swedish Look. Some such as the instructions for creating a ""Roller Blind with Lace Trim"", are useful, some, such as ""The Garden Gate Radiator Cover"", are of dubious utility and inspiration. Authentic this book is not, but if you are interested in the Swedish style and wish to transform a room or apartment into a semblance of the Gustavian look on a tight budget, it may be of use to you."
1,HORRIBLE,Agree with everyone else. Software is based on FLOPPY DISKS. This is simply unacceptable in 2009. Stay away from this at all costs.
2,Should have ordered from another source?????,"It took a month for delivery. The stated time was 2-9 business days. The delivery was shipped the day AFTER I complained to the company,(Gristedes in New York),...HMMMM.....UPS couldn't figure out how to deliver to a P.O. Box?????(I have had numerous packages go UPS to USPS to P.O. Box) To make matters worst the shipment was short 2 packages of product. I think next time I will stay on the West Coast for faster delivery and a little extra $$$$. GOOD LUCK if you order from Gristedes Market in New York!!!! (And, remember to stay on top of the order to make sure that you actually get it.....)The ONE positive note was that the product was AWESOME as far as freshness and presentation!!!"
4,good dunker,"cookie part is nice and chocolaty but I could do without the swirled icing. It adds too much sweetness, and melts when dunked in my coffee."
5,Excelente Pedal!!!!,Excelente pedal!!! Es un boost sin saturacion excelente para las partes donde queremos que la guitarra destaque!! Indispensable!!! :D Saludos desde Venezuelaaa!!!
5,"Clean, quiet effect.",Purchased this to boost the output of a Yamaha Silent Bass - adds just the right amount of gain with no noticeable noise and no coloration.
5,Wide Angle Lens for Canon S5,Bought this for a trip to Alaska recently and kept the lens on for most of the 200 pics . Love this easy to attach lens.
4,Good lens to have in your bag...,"I have this lens and the teleconverter. The only drawback I have so far seen is that there is a dark arch in the bottom of the pictures when using the flash. I wish Canon had designed in threads for a UV-Haze filter, but they did not. That's a big piece of glass to be hanging out there with no protection from scratches and fingerprints. Be careful. Do not let idiots and people with butterfingers use your camera when this lens is attached. Rather, never let idiots and butterfingered dimbulbs use your camera. Period."
4,Great Lens,"I've only had the lens for a month and it seems to be working out great. I'm no expert and usually have my camera set to ""Auto"" and the picture quality with this lens seems to be very good. I'm anxious to use it on my upcoming trip to Australia.However, as mentioned in other reviews, the lens does create a shadow when using the camera's flash. I would recommend this as a worthwhile addition to the S1/S2/S3/S5 IS Digital Camera."
2,Not very wide and blocks the flash,"This lens only provides a modest bump in wide-angle coverage. Standing in an average room at home, it's the same as stepping back one foot. I'm not sure it's worth the money for that tiny gain.Also, it partially blocks the flash on the S5. If you plan to use it with the built-in flash, expect the bottom third of each photo to be dark. Fun."
4,wide angle,"Fairly decent. Produces pictures with optical blur on the edges if you use zoom. Leaves black semicircle on pictures taken with a flash about 1/5 the way up from the bottom on the picture because the flash isn't tall enough to miss the wide lens. Other than that.. it does capture a few more degrees. If you are going to pick this or the telephoto attachment, get this."
3,Some good Some bad,"I was happy with the clarity of the optics, the fit(when screwed together, they where almost seamles), but, and this is a BIG but, the built in flash does not work well with either the WC-DC58A or the TC-DC58B converter. A dark area created by a shadow from the lense overpowers the rest of the picture area. So if you want wide or additional telephoto capabilities, don't expect to be able to use a flash. It seems there is a more powerful off camera flash from Canon, BUT it is a slave (no direct fire from camera as far as I can find}, thus it is activeated by the on camera flash and you get the same old shadow. Who ever designed this has their head where the sun does not shine, so to speak."
5,The Best Of the Best,This album is the best of Lisa Lashes! Awesome beats combined with amazing melodys will make this album a #1 hit for many years!
4,A song of relaxation...,"I enjoyed this CD. It arrived quickly in a jewel case. It is free of any discernible defects. When I bought this CD, I was looking for one that had just wolves howling. I knew this one had music in it, but after listening to it, the wolves and music mesh very well together. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys wolves and/or soothing music."
3,I used to love this CD,"I used to have this audio tape. One day I really wanted to hear track 8, and I looked everywhere for it and couldnt find it. I thought ""Heck, why not?"" and bought the CD here on Amazon. Its a great CD, although really there are only a few good songs and one magnificent song (track 8) Good for background noise for sure."
5,Fun for the Family,"I bought the Heroscape Game and 3 expansion sets (including this one) for Christmas for my 8 year old son. We brought it with us when we met with the whole family the week after Christmas. My 14 year old nephew, 9 year old nephew and 45 year old brother-in-law had a blast playing it and creating new scenarios each evening. It is a wonderfully creative game with endless possibilities and the Road/Bridge expansion kit is one of the key additions that really adds to the set. If you have to choose just one set to add, I would get this one first. The only downside is that the complex version of the game is a bit too advanced for my 8 year old, but he enjoys playing the basic version and setting up the landscapes."
5,Good expansion with figure,"This is another great heroscape expansion with a pretty good figure (actually for cost 25 he may be a little too good, but whatever). Its worth the cost to have the 5 trees (which are quite large) and the bridge. Great addition to nearly any game board setup."
5,THE LEGION OF CRIMSON HAWK,"This is a very nice add on to the heroscape game! I suggest you buy at least two of them if you want a nice set. The bridge is awesome to use to go over water and lava. The road tiles add to you base movement so you can travel faster. The trees are a very nice addition to heroscape and provide cover to hide behind, yes a very nice set. Buy yours today!"
5,Good Book,"Good book, arrived as described in good condition. The postage is ridiculously high, and if it was not for a gift voucher, it would be prohibative."
5,Great Gift for Avid Chefs,"I have this book in my personal cooking library and have given it as a gift multiple times to others who enjoy southern cooking but want to keep the flavors while practicing healthy eating. The herbs and spices are not overwhelming, and the breakdown of nutrients helps to plan a varied and tasty menu for even a covered-dish dinner for our LARGE family of seven children and eighteen grandchildren."
1,the butchers,"I am a huge troma fan but I must say this is the worst most boring and not entertaining film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through I can't beliee troma would put their name on this garbage the worst three bucks I've spent in a while I wish I could give this ""film"" a negative ratingSAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!!"
3,Decent Album,"Al Green proved by this album that his still has great vocal abilities. This album isn't great as his hits such as ""Let's Stay Together"" or ""I Can't Get Next To You"" but the songs are alright considering that it would be near impossible to create songs that could match the greatness of his early songs. OK album. 3 1/2 stars for me."
3,pretty Good Set but could use R.Kelly,"glad to hear Al Green&Willie Mitchell back together again after all of these Years.the Musicianship is tight&the arrangements are cool as well.Vocally Al Green still has that Soulful ""IT"" Quality that makes the Brother timeless to the Ears.the songs overall don't touch the 70's Peak&Hit Parade that Al&Willie had but not many Acts can touch that magic either.but this Set is Good&a welcome return.when Neo-Soul emerged I said that the first Artist I wanted to Hear come back in the Modern Era was Al Green&I got My Wish. the more I listen to this set the more it seems kinda just there.He could have used an R.Kelly track or three to Modernize his Vibe better overall.this album is already done for me."
1,Disappointed!,"I loved the 70's AG, but I couldnt help but think all the way through this CDGawd!He sounds like Tina Turner during her 'Private Dancer' days.(For most folks that would be a compliment)--but 4 AG?no way!'I Can't Stop' seems to sample all the '70s hits and it just doesn't work. I think AG made a secular CD because his friend Willie was ailing.Al Green should take a few lessons from Allen Toussaint.Stay true to Urself!!!"
4,"The ""Rev"" returns with a vengeance!","Green's first studio album since 2001's ""Feels Like Christmas"" is proof positive that his is a voice that has sorely been missed on today's R & B scene. Of course, the songs sound as if they were recorded in the 70's. That was, without a doubt, Green's and producer/co-writer Willie Mitchell's intent. Each song features dynamic arrangements with REAL horns, superb background vocals, and the definitive GREEN style and sound.After listening to this album's standout track, ""My Problem is You,"" the many contemporary ""usurpers"" to Green's throne should realize that he cannot be unseated.He is a ONE and ONLY!"
2,Not durable.,"Very good mic quality and sound quality for the price, but very cheap construction. The folding portion of the headset broke after 6-months of daily wear and use.The foam covers slip off of the earphone very easily, the headset was comfortable for me to wear with an average head size and as a glasses wearer."
1,cheap quality,"Cheap quality, flimsy, you have to hold it with your hands otherwise it will not stay in your ears. A shame for Altec Lansing. It's a pity they discountinued the AHS-433 model (not folding) which was an excellent product, sturdy and with leather-imitation pads."
2,missing the USB connector !!! microphone stopped working after 6 months!!!!,"I bought this product which is shipped and sold by Amazon, then this headset does not come with the USB adapter like people say on customer reviews. What a misleading review! Shame on Amazon!Update review:The microphone has stopped working after 6 months. I would never buy anything from Altec Lansing again."
3,Not as advertised,"This is advertised as a four disc set. I recieved a sealed, new, two disc set. The music is as advertised and of excellent audio quality, just two discs short."
5,A rare Kitano gem!,"I'm a big fan of Takeshi Kitano films, and I'm glad I picked up this rare comedy gem. Getting Any? is definitely different from his other films, but that does not mean it is not entertaining. On the contrary, Getting Any? holds up very well even after repeated viewings, and more importantly the jokes are just as funny as they were the first time around. It is quite refreshing to watch Kitano and his wacky characters in this all out comedy, that makes fun of just about everything holy to the Japanese culture. I sincerely recommend this film to anyone who likes comedies. It's a must for Kitano fans."
2,Occasionally funny,"I really wanted to like this film, because it is silly, and weird, and has cute topless girls in it. But I found that it was very amateurishly executed. It may have been on purpose, because apparently film maker is quite famous, and he says he is making fun of himself as a film maker. But it just did not work for me, sorry."
5,Heavy-duty Pastry Blender,"This heavy-duty pastry blender feels good in the hands and is very sturdy. Unlike the wire ones I've had in the past, this one will last forever. Dough does get stuck between the whatchamacallits, but it is easily pushed out. I have made scones using this tool, and they came out great! I recommend this for anyone who uses one on a regular basis. You'll never have to buy another."
5,real good book,"i liked this book a lot. ever since i fled iran in the late 70's, i'd been looking for a practical guide for living my life. finally i have found it. i can pick melons in the supermarket like a pro! buy this book."
4,"Overpriced for a ""single"" but nice","This ""album"" contain just 3 mixes of the same song. That being the case, it is probably not worth the money unless, like me, you really like the song, really like the artist and really wanted it anyway. It was worth it for me."
2,Disappointing.,"I deplore shoddy workmanship on some of the maps. One good example is page 25: I can't readily see the difference among the same color family. Considering I'm a color expert, this is a big drawback. Soft yet vivid water-color technique may help improve the quality. Well, the problem may be with the printer rather than with the author.The layout of the book in general, i.e., text and graphics, lacks good aesthetic quality. Better fonts and generous margins would help improve it by a great measure.All in all, the book doesn't live up to its price. By the way, I must add that I have not read the text closely yet and am not disputing the scholarship of the author."
2,Great when it works,"This pen is comfortable to hold and the ink flows nicely...when it works. I've had this pen well over 2 years now and I've finally gotten so fed up with the cartridges that I don't use it anymore. The refill cartridges mysteriously stop working while there's still plenty of ink left. This is not just a fluke and has happened to me and my husband many, many times."
5,best pocket pen around,i've used this type of pen for 6-7 years. First onewas given to me as a gift. Recently replaced thatone. Spring wore out in the first one. Why do I likethem? Very convenient to carry in a pocket. Forthe ladies in their purse. Writes very well. Verysatisfied with this one.
5,If your a fan of Electric Miles this is a must own.,"This is a phenominal album. If you are a fan of Miles' Electric/Fusion era, then you should buy this immediatly. If your a fan of his earlier work, you may find this album a bit more abstract than you would like, however it does showcase Miles' incredible playing."
3,Overbrewed,"I gave up a year of my life to this album. I tried again and again to break into the maelstrom and ended each time on my arse! I can honestly say that now I can listen to it with the ears of one who knows what is coming next, I played it in the car, on my walkman.......any chance I got I listened to this sickening music trying to 'get' it. I failed, it holds no beauty for me. As for the bonus tracks...If Miles left them off the original we can only assume that he thought they were inferior, I know that I do!!!! Save your money and buy 'In a Silent Way' several times and give it to your friends. They'll thank you for ever!!!!"
2,"Great album, but condition was not as advertised.","The copy of this album I ordered was advertised as ""like new."" When it arrived, though, the package was quite a bit more worn than I'd have expected. This wouldn't have been too much of an issue had the first CD not been deeply scuffed in two places, rendering part of it unreadable."
4,Excellent set for the money.,"At the moment, this is the starter set in the series, although they show an even smaller Dizzy set in the catalog but it's not yet available. You get Benny, a fence, an orange cone, a window and building piece. There isn't much to build after putting Benny together, but you can't expect much for the price. Little Benny has the front loader and rear scoop, so your child should love playing with him. The other plus about Benny is that he is small and stout and out of all the Bob Duplo characters, he withstands heavier play without his pieces popping off. The one downside is he is the only one (although Dizzy will probably be the other if it's ever released) that is not able to fit the little Bob character inside. All the other sets come with the Bob figure but this one."
2,Not so good,This one is rather small and doesn't really look or feel like the rest. Not as durable feeling as the others.
3,Too hard for a 2-year-old,"I generally agree with the other reviewers, but I'll add one thing. The box says that the age range for this toy is 2-5. However, the rod connectors are too hard to assemble for a child this young. Even as an adult, I have to be careful when I connect and disconnect those pieces, because I risk breaking them if I use a lot of force. Of course, all that means is that I have to help my children every now and then, but I think the other Bob The Builder LEGO sets are a better choice."
3,Interesante reflejo del poder,"El poder corrompe y el poder absoluto corrompe absolutamente, ha dicho Garcia Marquez. El libro de Ramirez es sin duda una prueba adicional de esta afirmacion, dolorosa prueba para aquellos que crecimos creyendo que la revolucion sandinista marcaba un rumbo para latinoamerica.Extraniamente, la energia personal de Ramirez refleja la corrosion (no puedo decir corrupcion) del poder: nunca he conocido a otra persona con tan mala energia y desilusion del genero humano, hablando de ideales y de luchas en las que no cree. Juraria que este señor se levanta añorando las tardes dulces del poder, como el coronel Aureliano Buendia con sus calzoncillos de godo, la bacinilla en la mano, camino al taller de orfebreria....."
3,Not very comprehensive,"Although the book has a lot of nice pictures, much of the information is basic. I thought it was not very comprehensive. The book itself is tiny, and you could easily read it cover to cover in half an hour or less. I was not impressed. Save your money and go with a more complete book on English Springer Spaniels, like ""The English Springer Spaniel"", also sold on this website."
3,So much potential for this show,I think this show has some pretty lame gender stereotypes but other than that I'm surprised that the so enlightened french made this cartoon(laughing hysterically and snorting). I love this show even though it is done in anime style. I feel this show would have been much better if they ditched the gender stereotypes and gave the characters more in-depth personalities. I think this show would have been a blast if the girls were given real missions instead of standard saturday morning cartoon drek. I feel that calling it a cheap imitation of anime is too harsh a rating. All though I have plainly stated my complaints other than that I recommend Kim Possible a hundred times over this show. It has a strong heroine and is funny too.
1,Sorry but,"I really despise this show. There. I've said it.Sam, Alex, and Clover are all about being the most popular and ""cool"" in their school. They're too ""OMG! Like, let's go to the mall, and OMG like, boys are there!"" and ""Let's flirt with every cute boy we see! Like, totally!"" for my tastes.This is definately for the girliest girl that's ever existed, as anyone else might feel like throwing up after 5 minutes.It's all about how they look, and really... Sorry about this, but if that Jerry guy had real sense, he'd quickly dispose of the girls, who are actually probably causing more of a problem than the ""villians"" they take out.Too materialistic and popularity oriented for me, but hey, if you like this kind of stuff, go for it."
1,Totally Crap.,"Not only is the art below par, the one thing that gets me the most about this show is the blatant idiocy and prejudice of the girls.Throughout the series, the girls are always flaunting their ""popularity"", always putting down the kids who are different, as if they were, as human beings, any less human. The girls may have a go-getter attitude, but they have a very powerful attitude vs. authority problem. In one of the episodes, Alex applies for a job at the mall... but is constantly flaring about how she doesn't ""have to listen to anyone!"" This is the kind of attitude that fosters school bullying problems, and results in school shootings.Sorry, but I'm not interested in teaching my children arrogance, attitude, and to follow the false ""popular-is-best"" lie that society gets trapped in so much."
2,"Throw Me a Bone, Please","Ok, the book is well written, good command of english, well researched, etc, etc, but PLEASE, that which is submitted as great fiction does not need to be abysmally dark and depressing. I stopped reading about half way through when the boat full of war orphans was sunk by the nazi U-boat. Mine you the book was depressing up till then, but that tipped my scale. I'd recommend the book to someone dedicated to reading who can ignore the story's melencholy..."
3,"Good, but not Pulitzer good.","I thought that the writing was very good, the story entertaining, if not particularly moving in any way. I was curious to read this, because the author lives in Berkeley and it had one the Pulitzer.Although I'm not sorry I bought it and I enjoyed it, I guess that I think that a Pultizer-winning novel should somehow reflect some part of reality or bring me to some greater truth, but it didn't it. It seemed very geared towards guys who grew up with comic books and have certain associations with that.The truths seemed to be the truths of men who become fathers, or who are emotionally crippled. So, maybe this is a ""men's novel.""To me, something like the Poisonwood Bible would be Pulitzer material, because you never think of Africa in the same way after reading it."
4,"Superheroes, Houdini,The Golem of Prague...","Welcome to the Golden Age of Superheroes! Fueled by imagination the team of Kavalier and Clay create the Escapist, a combination of Houdini and Superman, who battles Nazis before anyone else and becomes one of the most popular superheroes ever. Michael Chabon has recreated the world of the thirties and forties, a world populated by surrealists, escape artists, radio stars and comic books. With Kavalier, a young man who escapes the Nazi occupation of Prague, and Clay, a New Yorker who escapes from an unhappy childhood, Chabon creates an endearing team. While the book loses focus when Kavalier goes to war, the total effect is one of nostalgia looked at through the eyes of a modern writer with a love for wonderful world of comics. Besides any guy who thanks Jack ""King"" Kirby in his acknowledgements deserves my thanks for remembering one of comics' greatest artists."
5,Better than Wonder Boys,"I think everyone else has pretty much summed up the plot, characters, etc., but I thought I'd add that I read Wonder Boys and didn't really like it, so I almost didn't read A.A.K.C. But, I'm glad I did, because it really is one of the best books I've ever read. Some of the vocabulary is a little heavy so keep a pocket dictionary around; and if you're not familiar with Jewish folk tales and mysticism, it might be good to read something like Gershon Winkler's Golem of Prague book or just review the golem of prague legend itself.Overall, it's the best book I've read since Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita."
3,Couldn't finish it,"I couldn't even finish this book!! Maybe it was just the wrong time for me, but the story line moved so slow that it seemed as though nothing was EVER happening. In my mind, the beginning of the story is the most important part, it's what grabs the reader, and keeps them turning the pages; drags them into the plot and ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" just didn't do that for me."
5,One of my favorite works of fiction,"This is one of those rare but wonderful books that immediately pull you into the writer's world where you just want to stay forever. There is a sense of being in a contemporary Mark Twain novel, really. In addition to having well-developed characters with complex lives, we learn so darned much about everything. I learned something about the history of the comic book and about the way comics used to be produced. I learned more about a myth I knew only a little - the golem. I learned about world fairs and WWII. I was sad when the book came to an end because I then had to leave this world. Frankly, it was quite a spell before I could get into another book. I recommend the book often and loudly."
4,Great Book! Pulitzer Prize though?,I can speak very highly of this book. A fantastic adventure of two boys who write/draw comic books in the run-up to World War II. Kavalier escaped from Nazi occupation of Austria and Clay is a boy with bigger dreams than talent. They are a perfect match - and a perfect commentary on freedoms and life during a very hard time in America's history.
2,Read the Wonder Boys instead,"Having just finished the Wonder Boys, an engrossing and very funny book, I began K and K with great anticipation.What a disappointment. There is a little light humor here and there, but in the main this is a long and rather disjointed tale which totally fails to maintain any momentum. I have persevered to the 71% mark but I'm now beginning to resent the time which could have been spent on the next book in my queue.Do read the Wonder Boys. It's, well, wonderful..David"
3,"GREAT first half, fair second half","I fell in love with this book at the start. The writing was clean, the story immediately swept you in. Yet I couldn't help but feel that at the midpoint of the book (I don't want to reveal when, plot-wise, so as to not give anything away), the book fell off considerably. The first half was stellar for its story -- the story really fell apart toward the end, and the writing was not as tight as it had been at the start. I am still glad that I read it, though, for the burst of wonder and excitement that I had when I opened it."
3,Wide But Not Deep,"If they had tucked a ten dollar bill on page 500 I would have found it. This book kept me turning the pages until the rather weak ending. But, remember the scene in ""Finding Forrester"" where Sean Connery is supposed to be reading his talented protoge's work in front of an audience but the camera cuts away and all you hear is a few scraps of unintelligible vocalization in the background? I felt like Chabon was doing a lot of ""telling"" and not much ""showing."" I could not really feel the intensity of the art his young protagonist was producing, even though I was told how intense it was.Good story, entertaining reading, but I could see the author's hand and that kind of spoils the game."
4,Entertaining,"All readers will enjoy this big, fun book. It is full of humour with characters and descriptions that are slightly larger than life, in keeping with that which drives the plot forward - the history of comic books in the Unites States. I recommend it."
5,WOW! It was amazing!,"I finished ""The Adventures..."" last night and probably won't pick up another book for a few days. When I read a book of this caliber, I like to reflect on it for a few days.I was so impressed by this book! I was interested for the entire 600+ pages. It was exciting, funny, serious, and incredibly descriptive. Sometimes it gave the feeling of a comic strip and I could visualize NYC in the 40's.The characters were well written, I cared about what happened to them. I see that some reviewers complained about a bit of ambiguity, but I prefer that a writer not tell me every detail. Instead we are trusted to know the characters well enough to make draw our own conclusions on the unsaid. I believe Chabon accomplished this, as I did not feel ""left in the dark"" at all.I would recommend this book to anyone who is not intimidated by it's length, regardless of whether or not they are interested in comics. This book is not ""fluff,"" it is deep and intelligent."
4,Dictionary required....,"I can see why this novel won a P. Prize......well written, concise in explanation - maybe too much information for my taste. Subject matter: enjoyable and worth reading. It is not often a dictionary is needed when reading, but this time I marked twelve pages in thirty. A heavy tome with good qualities, but I would not read it again."
1,"Stink,Stank,Stunk","I really wanted to like,love,appreciate and become emamored with this book as if it was a lover, and yet this was not the case I was fond of the setting, of the time period and the storyline placing two young men together trying to find their place in the world, one a visual artist the other a writer and yet the writing always took me out of the storyline Michael Chabon has a style of writing that just comes across as if I was sludging thru a wasteland of armatures never sturdy enough to hold onto the tangible storyline I was always reminded that I was reading and never felt I could just enter ino the story."
2,what a time waster,"Can't for the life of me figure out how this book won the awards it has. Although I finished it, simply because I hate to not finish something I've started, many times during the read I wanted to put it down. Nothing happens, nothing at all and it just goes on and on. Recommended only for the comic book fanatic who is easily pleased."
1,Takes 10 minutes to read 5 minutes of action.,"This is the most overwritten book that I have ever read. This author could write for 2 pages about his own fingerprint. This book could have been cut in half and been much more interesting! I read books to get into the plot, not read a lot of fancy prose."
1,Chabon Has Done Considerably Better,"I agree with most of the others who found the book overblown with characters that should have become more interesting than the comics they loved. What I find truly interesting, though, is the number of people who found this book engaging. I read it on the basis of good reviews. Likely my last Chabon book, which is sad because he has written some wonderful stuff."
2,I kept waiting for the good parts...,"It's possible that I went into this book with inaccurate expectations, but I was dissappointed with it.I think the one big hindrance I had was that I am not an immigrant, I am not gay, and I don't hate German people.These three topics seemed to be the driving motivations for the characters in the book. While the story appears to be floating around a fictitious comic book publishing company, the personal lives of the artist and writer are where we spend most of our time.This author may not appreciate that a heterosexual man may not want to read about a character's homosexual attraction to another man. Or that descendants of German immigrants may not want to read about Germans being so hated and reviled during this period .I'm sure that jewish, gay men living in New York find this book to be wonderful, the author does write very well.But I and most people I know here in the south are probably not part of the target audience."
3,just eeeehh,It was just okay for me. I can't believe this book won a publizer prize. I liked the twist in the Radioman chapter. The last chapter helped resolved the characters.
2,must be a guy thing,"I am finding this book boring, obscure, and irritating. I guess I don't really care about a couple overgrown boys who love comic books. I work with them everyday, though in modern times, it's video games that they like. To me a hero isn't someone who can leap tall building but, rather, someone who overcomes personal demons to become a stronger person who can care for other people. In other words, a female. :-)I am finding this book especially disappointing because I liked Wonder Boys. I admit that I don't plan to put it down, even though I might skim some of the longer paragraphs and give up on looking up the annoyingly obscure words that I've never seen before. But I find it kind of irritating that it's good enough for me not to want to give up on it but not good enough for me to thoroughly it."
2,Mind-numbingly boring,"Chabon has a masterful command of the English language. Either that, or he has a masterful command of a thesaurus. I've never seen such unnecessary vocabulary used anywhere. It was excessive, confusing and at times, it looked like he only wrote these words to show off.Mr. Chabon - Tell a story. Tell it well. Stop writing.Unless you have a lot of time to flip the pages of this directionless and frustrating book, skip it. Read something more interesting and exciting. There's plenty out there."
1,Verbal Gymnastics,Two words describe this book. Slow & Boring. Chabon is one of those authors that apparently writes with a dictionary by his side. I've never seen so many words that I've never heard of before.(Except Clive Barker's Imajica)The story just never moves along and I think that it is written for those with a jewish backround. I just didn't understand all his judaic references. ( Would someone please tell me what a Golem is ?) If you're looking for an adventurous book than this is not for you. If you are looking for another book that plods along and wallows in it's self important vocabulary and all along you are thinking that boy am I smart I can understand everything he is writing than this is for you.To compare this with a comic book as some others are would be to liken charles dickens to spongebob squarepants
5,This book ROCKS!,This book is so engrossing that I missed my stop on several occassions while reading it during my daily commute on public transportation. I didn't mind though. It gave me more time to read!
5,"LONG, but still great","This book is very long but is one of the best books of all-time! The plot is very good with many surpises and the characters are very real. If your going on a long trip this is the book for you. It deserved the Pulitzer Prize and more. The first 70 pages are boring, but keep with it because the rest is worth it the next 550 pages are amazing."
4,Everything happens in this book,"This book is everything you ever wanted and more. The heyday of comic books, WWII, magicians, New York City, love, homosexuality, secrets, even the South Pole!!! You just can't predict what might happen when you turn the page.Michael Chabon is a master of character development. I LOVED all of the characters and felt such empathy for them in their struggles. The main characters were fascinating in their connection to each other....Joe breaking the chains, only to have Sammy chained to what Joe leaves behind.Don't let the size of this book put you off. The chapters fly by, and you'll still be thinking about these characters long after you've finished the ~700 pages."
4,A great but somewhat disappointing American experience,"Through the first two thirds of of Kavalier and Klay, Chabon shows a great mastery of the story-telling art. The novel moves with perfect pace and beautifully constructed sentences. Chabon captures much of the American experience of the era, particularly in regards to the immigrant experience. But Chabon gets hung up on a certain element in the last third (I won't reveal exactly what it is, as it is a major plot factor). Consequently the book almost falls apart in my opinion. Chabon hammers the reader over the head with this certain aspect, and it simply becomes annoying. Perhaps others won't view it as large a hinderance as I do, but for me it became too heavy-handed. Overall, I still believe the book is a great accomplishment and a great read for anyone, but it would have benefited from a little more restraint on Chabon's part in the end."
5,Fascinating,"I took one look at this book and knew I had to read it. It was a little different than I thought it would be, but I thoroughly enjoyed it anyway. Joe Kavalier and Sammy Klayman are cousins. Sammy is just a bored adolescent when Joe, a refugee who took magic lessons, comes to live with him and his mother. Together they get the idea to sell their own comic books and create 'The Escapist', who becomes a major hit. The book talks about the comic book but really centers on the two boys' journey of self discovery over the years. It's another hit by Michael Chabon."
5,Sometimes you have to call a book a great American novel . .,"The phrase, ""the great American novel"" is cliched, and I don't even believe in saying that a book is ""the"" great American novel. But occasionally a book is good enough that I feel I need to call it ""A"" great American novel because it paints a picture of a place, a cultural moment, and struggles in the U.S. in a way that changes the way you can see U.S. culture and history. This is one of those books. I'm not a big comic book reader, but he seduced me with the characters' love of comics, and masterfully touched on such themes as the relationship between art and political resistance, the holocaust, romantic love, homophobia, and friendship through a book about comics. This book is masterful. It is well worth your time."
3,Mixed reaction,"An impressively vast story that fell a bit flat for me. It felt as though the book still needed cutting and fine-tuning and the long opening sentences and frequent use of large words made my attention stray. It was also very much a boy's book, with the few women in the story usually serving mothering or sex roles. Though it's definitely not among my favorites, the story of an unlikely team of comic book writers--a New York boy with low self-esteem and his Jewish cousin from Prague, escaping the Nazis, was unique, though at times, it felt stretched."
2,Boring,"I was disappointed in this book. I didn't even finish it. I tried and tried to like it, but it was just too dense and there wasn't enough reward to keep going. It reminded me a bit of the The Fountainhead, only the story isn't as good and the characters aren't nearly as interesting. They are somewhat intriguing. That's what kept me coming back to it, but after I'd made it halfway through without ever getting to anything that ""hooked"" me in, I decided it wasn't worth the effort."
5,"Baroque, yes. But brilliant, too","I haven't been so taken by a book for a long, long time. Chabon's use of language, while sometimes over the top, is also frequently so evocative and original that I'm amazed. Beyond this, the book is also very funny, quite moving, and full of enough plot to keep the reader turning the pages. I don't even like comic books, but Chabon makes this world so engaging, and so intrinsically woven into the world of pre-war New York, that it becomes fascinating. Really a tour de force. Give it a try."
1,Lacks depth,"The characters, plot, and themes lack any sort of interesting, analytical depth that makes a book worth reading. Chabon is consistently infatuated with the extreme breadth of his vocabulary, which is quite impressive but is not enough to carry a book or make a book ""great."" While reading this gigantic paperweight of a novel, I also read a book by Graham Greene and a handful of short stories by Flannery O'Conner just so that I wouldn't forget WHY I enjoy reading. I slogged through to the end and found that I had held out hope only to be left still wanting something else."
3,Had its moments,"This is the second Chabon book I've read (the first being Wonderboys). Both books had similiar, distracting sections. In Wonderboys, the Jewish family dinner at Grady Tripp's ex-wife's house was too long and couldn't hold my interest. Same with the Radioman section of this book--with Kavalier in Antartica. The transition was not smooth and it took me a while to realize that he was there for the US military. What an awkward section to struggle through.Certainly, the book had its moments. Escapism from Eastern Europe to the US. That alone is enough for those Pulitzer judges to perk up. Nice themes, and generally a nice-flowing story. Not sure it was really worthy of the Pulitzer and I liked Wonderboys better."
1,many toos,"This book was too long, too confusing and too much work to read and understand. Some good proses sections. Moments of insight."
2,This book was not worth the time it took me to read it.,"I had read a number of online reviews telling how wonderfull this novel was, but when I read it for myself I was extreamly disapointed by its lack of everything. I finished the book thinking why did I read this? It dragged in plot and flipped around so much that I could keep things straight. I do not recomend this book to anyone who likes to read, becase you will be let down. And for those people who hate to read, don't go near this book because it will bite you and you'll get discouredged from reading anything"
2,Truly puerile (hence its popularity),"This 640-page essay in political correctness is a bloated bore of a book whose fanatical reception is a frightening commentary on the utter debasement of U.S. literary ""culture."" If you love comic books, never progressed beyond puberty in your mental and emotional development, think like everybody else does, and have an infinite capacity for tolerating tediousness, this is definitely the book for you. The author is far from unskilled in verbal artistry, but his conception of character, plot, and theme is that of a highly gifted high school sophomore. In short, this is a children's book, not something a mature adult can enjoy."
1,About two-thirds too long,"Less a novel than Chabon's ample opinion of his vocabulary, this book needed editing like Britney Spears needs underpants. Too long, too ambitious, too bad I was not warned!"
1,Pullitzer Prize Ausbrecher=Escape,"I really wanted to know how a Jewish boy from Prague made it big with his cousin in New York. His 1935 or so escape from Czech-Republic in a coffin with a dead Golem (no translation offered who this weirdo is and why) made me read on. The pair in the box wasn't stopped by the Reichssicherheitsdienst; they were probably not more on the ball than Homelandsecurity is nowadays, I was withering on the vine of boredom and at page 200 I quit; 400 pages short of the end, never met Houdini or Tesla and other Ausbrecher. The author must have won the Pullitzer-Prize in a sweepstake. Give me a break! Gerborg"
3,Not that great.,One of those books that is too long and seems to be two different books. The first one is interesting enough following the escape with the golum and then working on comic books. I don't know if I'd call it classic. It's just a variation of stories about Hollywood. Then there's a second story that is just boring and not done very well.
2,"A Turgid and Verbose, Yet Original Novel","I had high expectations for this novel when my wife finished it and told me the entertaining subject. For the first 70 pages I was fully engaged and interested, especially about the fascinating story of the artist who escaped from the Nazis during World War II. Thereafter, I started skipping long sections of the novel owing to redundant descriptions and a very slow pace. Unfortunately, Mr. Chabon took an original subject and got bogged down in excruciating detail. It is indeed ironic that a novel about the fast-paced world of comic book characters reads more like a treatise on the art of the comic book. Perhaps the editor and not the author is at fault."
2,Brilliant beginning turns unfocused and long-winded...,"What starts as a wonderful and exciting story of WWII comic book geniuses turns into an exercise in ""admire my writing technique"", complete with painfully long diatribes and head-scratching tangents. In the end, a very disappointing book."
3,Not for everyone,"Chabon is not for everyone. And he's not for me. I once read F. Scott Fitzgerald in a letter giving advice to a young writer, ""It probably isn't a good idea to expand your vocabulary past a certain point. Because then you'll be tempted to use all those long words, and they will weigh your writing down."" I was astounded to read a legendary writer like Fitzgerald giving another writer advice to NOT acquire as big a vocabulary as possible. But this book--to me--shows how absolutely correct Fitzgerald was. Chabon himself once said, ""I have a big vocabulary, and I like to use it."" This book could have used a judicious editor. (The Oct. 5 review below gives examples of what I mean.)"
1,A long journey for little reward.,"I give the book 1 star for the simple fact that I finished it instead of giving up. Instead of giving a literary criticism, which plenty of others have done here, I will say the following:It took me 3 months to read this 600 page book. In that time I read 5 other books from front to back. 3 of those 5 I read in less than 2 days. The other 2 I read in less than a week.My point is this. There are books that grip you and make you continue turning the pages. Read the first chapter at the bookstore and see if this book does this for you. Otherwise, find a different book that does. Apparently some people loved this book. I did not. I finished the book merely because once I had gotten 100 pages into it I felt obligated to finish, no matter how difficult it later proved to be.Not recommended."
2,Don't understand all the hoopla,"While the detail is overwhelming, it is also awkwardly integrated into the story. At times the plot seems lost, and then, all of a sudden, like magic, it is there in full Hollywood-style melodrama. Some moments are absolutely implausible. You'd do better to stick to the Chabon stories... now, they're as light as air..."
5,Good Escapism,"The story of The Escapist and his creators is good escapism. I picked up this novel because it won the Pulitzer Prize, one of the most reliable sources for good literature. I wasn't disappointed. Whether you are a comic book fan or not, this is a powerful story about an important part of history. Highly recommended."
4,"Great, if not a bit pretentious","Although I have not yet finished Kavalier & Clay, I am thoroughly enjoying the book. Chabon is truly gifted -- while reading this, I find myself saddened now and then at the knowledge that I will never write like he does -- although at times his word choice and obscure allusions are somewhat pretentious. In other words, this is a great story that could be told in ""not so many words.""Nontheless, with 100 pages to go, I know I will be awake most of the night trying to finish. I find myself sucked into 1940s and 50s NYC, and involved in the lives of these characters -- all of whom I could befriend -- and it's difficult to put the book down once the plot gets rolling. I recommend Kavalier & Clay to anyone who enjoys well-crafted writing."
5,Favorite book of 2001,"Oh, what a rich, wonderful novel. Chabon will take you on an unforgetable adventure to cherish. The plot is so well crafted, and the characters rich, realistic, and yet somehow 'superheroic.'As a long time comic fan, I especially appreciate his attention to trade. He clearly did his homework. But that's clearly not what this book is about. There is really so much here to look at and love. You've got the Kavalier & Clay duo (emulating the great comic book pairings like Schuster & Siegel and Kirby & Lee) representing the impulse motivated/action oriented hero vs. the mild-mannered, reserved alter ego. You've got a remarkable portrait of American life from the 30's to the 50's and the cultivation of escapism in the American culture. And not least of all, you've characters who absolutely enthrall you and break your heart."
5,a superhero of a book,"wonderful adventure through time and continents. the writing is superb, the story line bold and entertaining. with a well-grounded backdrop of the rise and fall of the comic book industry, the book is a quick read with a plot that is constantly unfolding to keep the reader turning the pages."
3,Disappointing,"After reading some reviews for this book and noting the Pulitzer Prize award, I brought this book on vacation with some anticipation. I guess I expected something like Mark Helprin (A Soldier of the Great War, etc.). This book starts well but the pace slows to a crawl a third of the way through the book and utilizes contrived and unconvincing mechanisms to move the plot forward. Finally, I found the characters rather two-dimensional and not particularly appealing."
3,Feat of Clay,"Confessing that you didn't luv this book is equivalent to pulling out a John Birch Society membership card in some circles-you get a lot of suspicious looks. But once again hype has outstripped ability in a literary fiction phenomenon. ""Kavalier and Clay"" practically drips flop sweat from every page-Chabon obviously put a lot of work and thought into it. But the characters remain flat on the page; his idea of complexity is to make one hero gay and the other commitmentphobic. And a Holocaust backstory will only get you so far in answering the big questions. How about first asking some big questions? This book depressed me with its modest ambitions and writing-workshop earnestness. Could television-watching be lopping off a dimension of the imaginations of young novelists? Will J.S. Foer save the day? Stay tuned"
2,the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,I found this book's start so difficult that I just could not get into it. This happened to my wife too and we both gave up on it.
4,More than a novel about the golden age of comics,"While the initial chapters of this novel are a little slow, stick with it. This is the tragi-comic tale of two young men and their creation of a comic book alter-ego, The Escapist. As the tale of the conception of the character is interesting, it is the divergence of the lives of these two men that make the story so interesting and sad. A commitment, but worth the payoff at the end."
5,Wow!,Best book I've read in years. Chabon creates completely rounded characters that seem to jump off of the page. Highly recommended!
4,"Very good, but not a very easy read...","This book deserved its Pulitzer Prize, but it is not a breeze to read through. As I've told many friends, it is an easy book to put down, but not so easy to pick up again. It doesn't mean it's bad. I found it very rewarding, but it demands a lot of attention and thought from the reader. You will get more out of it, the more you know the City of NY and some of its 20th century history."
3,"Amazing Prose, but...","The first 250 pages of this novel are absolutely wonderful--beautifully written, compelling in plotting and characterization, thematically rich. Then, somewhere during the incipient romance with Rosa, between the digressive cameos of Al Smith and Salvador Dali and ""Citizen Kane"" inspiring Kavalier and Clay, Mr. Chabon lost me...And shortly after that the melodrama was ladled on liberally (the madness of already-lonely men in an isolated exotic locale, viz the scene in Antarctica), which I take it was supposed to resonate against the general themes of illusionism and magic and escape. But for me it didn't work (Not that it won't for you...) When the drive of the strong plot disappeared, and all I was left with was artfully-crafted prose, it became all the more jarring and unsatisfying, I'm sorry to say...Yet still, this book is way ahead of most of the works of fiction published today, for its ambition and the quality of writing alone."
5,I'm done. Now what?,"I recently finished this book, and am having a pretty hard time withdrawing from the story, the rich characters, the time in history and Chabon's incredibly cozy command of our language.The last time I let a writer suck me in so much was when I read Geek Love a few years back. Liked that? You're in for a treat."
4,100 Words or Less,"A mash-up of characters, perspective, plot, and focus that shouldn't work at all - comic book creators during WWII? Oh please! Ah, but it does work.The main driving force behind its success is the likeable, detailed characters. While I didn't always enjoy the multiple plot twists, I kept wanting to learn more about these people. They're unique enough to be interesting, but familiar enough to recognize.My only (minor) complaint is the first half is better than the second half, but even with that, this is a good (sometimes brilliant) novel that deserves attention. Fun. Interesting. Clever. A good read."
5,Chabon crafts another masterpiece.,"Even though I read and adored THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH, which was Michael Chabon's debut novel, I was not at all prepared for the scope of this work of his, which deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.It's an epic story about growing up Jewish in WWII-era New York. It's about the history of comic books, the way humans find means to escape the traps (both figurative and literal) in their lives.The character Joe Kavalier, a master escape artist and master comic artist, is one of the most fully-developed characters I've ever read. The odd romantic triangle that he, his cousin Sam Clay and their muse Rosa Saks find themselves in the middle of is original and charming.This is a great read."
3,Entertaining is not enough,"There's no denying Chabon's brilliant writing skills. Kept me turning the pages even when I didn't want to go on. And, having grown up as a comic book collector, I was supposed to be the perfect audience for Chabon's epic work on comics, Jews, the edges of the Holocaust and WWI, and America of the 20th century. But it just didn't work. Too much drama and entertainment, and not enough meaning. I guess that's no surprise: comics are always entertainment but never quite literature even at their best. My advice: read The Yiddish Policemen's Union and stop at that."
3,"Starts great, ends weakly","Some truly clever and original characters, and the first half of the book is a real joy, but it doesn't sustain, and then end drags on and the characters lose their depth."
5,Truly amazing,"This book is incredible. I was constantly amazed at the way Chabon can say something simple in a completely original way. He remarkably conveys the feelings of the characters so that you feel their joy, anguish, and embarrassment and want them to succeed. I've never before genuinely missed the characters when the book ended. This is an outstanding book and beautifully written."
3,Disappointing,"This book starts off very, very exciting...but quickly loses ground. The settings are absolutely enthralling, but Chabon forgets what to do with his sets. The ending is a thorough letdown, and I feel bad for all the characters involved, especially Clay's son. Not enough rewrites. Looking forward to better things from Michael Chabon."
1,OVERRATED,"This is an amazingly silly book. Poorly executed prose, lame meandering plot and boring characters. It's mind boggling how this book won any award."
1,Couldn't finish this book,"This book [isn't good] to put it mildly. I finally put this book down half way through. I *REALLY* tried to read it all the way through as I always finish a book I start. I jsut couldn't take it anymore. I was bored. I hated Cabon's writting prose, I hated his charachters, I hated this book period. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I'd rather pull all my eyelashes out for fun than read this book.on a side note..maybe the movie will be better!?"
2,Bored..,"I first heard about this book when mention was made of it on The OC, a television show. One of the characters, Seth, liked to read it, or had read it innumerable times.I thought I'd check it out on Amazon, and found that it was a Pulitzer Prize winning novel and that it had a lot of good reviews.I have always liked comic-books, and since the book is the story of two comic-book writers in the 40's, I thought it'd be good.I have to say, that the book didn't really hold my interest. I persevered with it, until just over half-way through, where I was put off by the homosexual antics of one of the characters.I still kept reading, but the gay stuff kept coming up, so I quit reading it.Maybe that wouldn't be enough to put some off, but, as I said, it was quite boring before that even.There are better novels on escapes and magic."
5,"The ending was bittersweet, but satisfying !!!!","I read a review on this site from a person that said he/she had loved the novel, but the final chapter destroyed the experience and only gave it two stars.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, so I respect this person's feelings.BUT, in my own personal opinion, the ending, as bittersweet as it was, I found it very moving and very just to the character of Sammy Clay. I won't give it away, but the man goes on a very difficult journey of self-discovery. A journey that as a gay person, just like the character, can completely understand.As for the child, he is not betrayed by the ending either, the boy gets what he truly needed, his father.I encourage, everyone to read this magnificent novel, I have been recommending it to everyone I meet since I read it a year ago. It's a stunning piece of literature. A true MUST READ !!!!"
5,So Damn Good,"I don't know, this book just clicked for me. Chabon weaves the story of two comic book creators into reality, with enough indexed information and works sited that it reads like a true accout. The story is good. I'll just put it that simply. If you give this book a try, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, I wouldn't want to know you."
2,"Boring, verbose, and ends abruptly",The title says it all. The characters were just interesting enough to keep me reading...kept waiting for some kind of payoff to make the investment of time worthwhile...never happened.
3,Really good for a while,"Chabon is brilliant writer. This could have been a brilliant novel except it gets stuck. The characters, plot, setting all develop in fascinating ways until about 2/3 of the way through. Then the notion of the golem becomes a useless distraction. Too bad. This could have been a great book."
5,Chabon's novel lives up to it's title,"What a treat to read sentences with substance. In this age of skinned and sparse writing designed to stimulate and titilate those with nanosecond attention spans, Chabon carries the torch of literary excellence. The use of Steinbeck's 'inter-chapter' technique is original and unifies the book.(...)"
5,My favorite book,"I loved this book so much. How much? Well, lets put it this way. I couldn't read another book for eight months afterward because they were so disappointing to me in light of this masterpiece. I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said, but I will say that if you're reading this review, you MUST read this book. You won't be sorry."
2,Does not compute.,"Could someone please explain to me how this won any award, much less the Pulitzer? I have loved every Pulitzer-winning novel I have ever read. Until now. Chabon's writing style drove me CRAZY. Too long, too many adjectives, and he does this annoying little thing with footnotes. I could not wait for this book to be OVER."
2,Another Pulitzer Dud,"I am a big Chabon fan and bought this book days after it hit the shelves. I couldn't even finish it. I got 350 pages in and realized I was reading an impressive research project that didn't contain a single character I cared about. It's amazing how often a young writer's learning to please some award committee coincides precisely with failing to please his/her biggest fans. If I want to learn about WWII New York and the history of comic books, I'll browse the non-fiction aisles. When I pick up Chabon, I'm looking for characters I want to take to bed with me every night. Don't expect to find them here."
2,A Pulitzer? Puh-lease,"I chose this book thinking that since it had won the Pulitzer Prize, it must be a masterpiece. Boy, was I disappointed! This novel is long, rambling and seems to go absolutely nowhere. Where's the climax? There is none. Don't waste your time."
4,Better than Before,"To be honest, I wasn't a real fan of Chabon's previous book, Wonder Boys. This book, on the other hand, I thought was considerably better. The characters were much more engaging and the plot, for the most part, was more interesting.The book does go a little off track at the end of part IV. The death of Joe's brother was too predictable to be streched out as long as it was as was Sammy's dealings (to a lesser degree) with Tracy Bacon. Still, there were enough nice things happening in parts V & VI to read past the poor transition."
3,"Good, but boring.","It was a good book, but I'm sad to say that it wasn't the best. The entire book was a grand masterpiece, but what a STRUGGLE it was to get through it! The boredom of this book is astronomical in human sense because the author doesn't seem to get to the point and prefers to stray away from the main story line. Sure, I enjoy him being descriptive of the surroundings and characters but he has overdone it. I was first considering to give this book 1 star, but considering the amount of work and effort Michael Chabon had put into this book, I have no choice to give it a 3. Give yourself a lot of time to read this book and to truly realize the fruits he has to offer."
4,A love letter to the industry he grew up with,"Though it was years later than when this book takes place, I grew up reading comics. This book will most likely find a warm spot in the heart of anyone else who did. Its a story of struggle, dreams, loss, mistakes and adventure during the rise of the comic book. I particularly enjoyed how, like H.P. Lovecraft, Chabon weaves historical facts and persons in with the historical fiction of his novel, right down to the footnotes.It has gotten me interested in reading some of the books he cites in the Author's Note about the history of the comic book."
3,A Deep work of fiction,"If you want a book to really sink you teeth into, one that will require all of your consontration, then this is the book. The story of two cousins and their Comic Book empire is very interesting. But the author goes off on many side stories, telling you background information that happened years before. I found myself wishing he would get on with the story in many cases. But once the story is moving again, it is very interesting and heartbreaking."
3,"Good story, but Uneven","Being a huge comic book fan growing up, I was really looking forward to this one. The first half of the book, was tremendous. It was beautifully written. The originality of the story, the characters, the prose: it was all systems go. The middle dragged a bit, but still kept me hooked. The last fourth of the book....was really disappointing. I didn't buy the marriage between Sammy and Rosa at ALL. The reunion between Sammy and Joe was completely underwhelming. And it ended on such a predictable and corny way. Ironic the novel was about comic books, because this story had a comic book ending."
2,A good example for a synthetic novel,"I like comic strips and respect them as a literary and art form. I am sincerely touched by the horrible suffering brought about by the Holocaust. I feel for homosexuals who are persecuted for their sexual identity. So why does this book not touch me emotionally? I had a similar experience reading Carlos Ruiz Zafon's 'Shadow of the Wind': in both cases the authors seem to be too clever for their own good, mixing ingredients and 'Zeitgeist' that seem to make sure to catch the attention of the reader and guarantee media attention and sales. In the case of Kavalier & Clay neither the story with all its improbabilities nor the characters with their shallowness convinced. A waste of time!"
2,If you don't like comic books you won't like this one either,"It's probably not fair that I write a review for this book, considering the fact I never finished it. Maybe it was just about to turn around and become interesting. But I doubt it. The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay combines a background of the horrors of Jewish persecution under Nazi Germany, with some kind of weird fascination with comic book super heroes. I suppose I just didn't get it since I've never had any interest in super heroes or most comic books. If you're a comic book fan you might feel otherwise. It's well written, and apparently meticulously researched. However, I was a bit put off by some of the writing which uses a form of the English language somewhat above my education level (Which only reached bachelors degree). You like comic books and super heroes? You might love this book. Lot's of people did. But not this guy. It goes back to the Salvation Army for the next reader."
5,Just a great book,"Well developed characters. Continually surprised about how they developed, but still remained in character. Eloquently written. Some memorable and brilliant paragraphs."
3,If only if could've been shorter,"I bought this book because it won the Pulitzer, and I was pleasantly surprised because the winners from the previous three years were boring and unoriginal (who cares about Woolf's pathetic life?) This book doesn't break any new grounds in terms of plot either (the friendships between the two boys seem vaguely reminiscent of Farewell to My Concubine), but it does involve adolescent friendships and comic books, two things that I treasure still. I was glued to this book for two nights because it brought back so many memories of my childhood. The only reason I give it three stars and not five is that it's too long and too much attention was put on one of the boys. Thanks to the panel of judges for the Pulitzer for finally choosing a book with a popular theme."
3,Not Pulitzer material,"A fun read at times, but needed another edit. The author especially loves to randomly toss in OED words out of the blue (the overuse of ""exegesis"" comes to mind). I could have loved this book if the story had been more succinct. Some of the writing was beautifully lyrical but it also often brought the story to a grinding halt for pages while the author jerked himself off over his technique and vocabulary.A good book, not a great book, and too long NOT to be great."
2,What went wrong here?,"I have been a huge fan of Michael Chabon's books up until this one. It took me a while to get into it and then it took a lot to keep me interested. When I got to the part when Joe was in Alaska with that guy who was skinning the dogs and gluing their fur to the plane, I almost put it down without finishing it. But I had to finish it - I had to see where the story would go from there, and then I was sorely disappointed because I felt that the ending was rushed and wrapped up too neatly. If the part about Joe's time in Alaska had been cut out and more attention paid to the ending and the characters, this would have been a much better book."
2,confusion between reality and...,"The writing seemed contrived and pretensious to me, but that kind of thing also seems to win awards for literature, so what do I know? The writing confused me between which was reality and which was make believe."
5,Great Book,"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. I was way better than I had expected, really well written and a wonderful plot."
5,Some of the best writing out there,"I can't even bother to read the reviews with 1-4 stars......it's baffling. I'll just say: if you have any interest in good prose, read this book. There are all sorts of other reasons to read it, sure. But I just want to say that it's some of the best writing I've seen, constantly surprising and exciting, hysterical, with careful and loving attention to vocabulary and language from the 30s/40s. I envy Mr. Chabon, and I will certainly read all his books."
5,A Real Adventure Story,"It's been a number of years since I read ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay"", but while some details have faded, it is a book I think of often. I picked it up without many expectations, but was surprised to find it thrilling, moving and engrossing -- the first great read of the millennium. Even now, ten years after I first encountered it, recalling the opening sequence where Joe Kavalier escapes Prague with a Golem makes me want to find another copy and reread it immediately. Unfortunately, I don't have that copy at hand -- I've passed this book along to others more times than I can count. A testament to it's power is that not one has come back to me! I'll just have to buy it again.If you haven't read this book, get a copy. You won't regret it."
5,A Love Story,"The love abounds in this wonderful novel, but the most shining love story is Chabon's obvious love for the Golden Age greats: Siegel and Schuster, Simon and Kirby, Gil Kane, Shelly Moldoff, Joe Kubert, Will Eisner. Love for men who didn't know the art that they were making, and how they were changing the face of the world.Chabon's style is lyrical, and not strictly my cup of tea. But the passion he has for these characters and these stories leaks off the page, and absolutely pulled me in. The epic sweep of this book is always anchored by the characters that compel you to read further, and the love that wracks your heart.If you're not a comic fan, worry not. This book is for you as well. It's simply a wonderful, engaging novel, regardless of subject matter. But if you read carefully , you might learn why the Golden Age of Comics had it's luster."
3,I haven't been able to finish it,"The writing style is pulitzer prize winning, which it got. But it dragged too much. I hope to go back and finish it. I started the Jack Reacher series instead"
3,If you are a fan of comic books and magic tricks you will love it,"I've read the incredible reviews about this book but to be honest it didn't do much for me. I often felt like the story got bogged down with long descriptions of irrelevant background. I've never been a fan of comic books or magic tricks so this could have something to do with my inability to connect with the characters at times. Maybe I don't fully appreciate the long proud history of comic books and their writers or great magicians such as Houdini. Both topics are the thread that holds the story together. This book is definitely about more than just comic books and magic tricks. It gives an interesting perspective into the way the world thought about things in the 1940's and '50s, especially families, sexuality, religion and smoking :) (everyone smokes heavily in this book). It is a long read and at times quite heavy."
3,"The first half sizzled, the second half fizzled","Chabon's writing is undoubtably talented and imaginative, yet I found his storytelling ( as in Wonder Boys) to be not compelling enough to make me want to keep reading. I lost interest in the characters' lives because the story turned flat and somewhat predictable, and well, basically boring. It was as if another writer took over for the second half. The first, with the descriptions of pre WWII Europe and the stories about the magic stunts was worth everything and I recommend reading the book for those rich parts in the first half. I cared, I cried, I loved those parts. And I was so disappointed with the way the book's energy and creativity seemed to melt away into a movie of the week."
4,Masterful,"I listened to the abridged version of this, which made me miss some of the exposition that Chabon loves to engage in. Kavalier and Clay's lives and the juxtaposition of New York as a city in those lives was very well done. NYC was almost like a third main character. Chabon also did a good job of describing the golem and other Jewish traditions without bogging down the story. Towards the end, a melancholy that stuck with me after the book ended set in. Kavalier and Clay live on, but their lives have gone from marvelous to ordinary."
4,Excellent Read,"This was the first Pulitzer-winner I've ever read, and judging from this book, I won't stop now. This is an excellent read, for anyone, comic book fan or not. I spent four solid hours finishing it off, and not every book can grab me like that. Definite recommendation."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book solely off the enjoyment I had in reading Chabon's ""Wonder Boys"". When it arrived, I quickly dove into it, and for the first half of the book, was engrossed (I am somewhat of a comic book fan, and the subject matter was extremely interesting and well presented). Then enter the predictable and trite parts of the book. As soon as the ""Ark of Miriam"" was sunk, this book went down with it. It became a labor to finish, and when I was finished, I felt like I had been cheated off of a promise. The book just ended. I was left wondering whether or not a chapter was left off of the book accidently. After reading ""Wonder Boys"", I was thoroughly disappointed with this book and I am left wondering whether it is worth going back to read some of Chabon's earlier work. I think not!"
1,Misleading title,"It is with some kind of relief that I discover I am not the only one who hasn't finished reading this acclaimed novel. An American friend had recommended the book to me, and I was attracted by the promising title, which I found rather misleading afterwards. After several attempts and 200 pages of confusing reading, I gave up trying to understand. If you're looking for an exciting story about two young people, this novel is certainly not for you.At the same time, I read ""The Solitude of Prime Numbers"" by Paolo Giordano, in two days - simply breathtaking!"
3,Good but Over-Rated,"This is one of those major event novels which the critics seemingly are forced to gush over, but which proves slightly disappointing. The bravura early chapters are certainly Pulitzer material, but the narrative loses steam and passion. Joe's wartime misadventures particularly seem forced. Chabon's big metaphors become strained. Finally, the oddball marriage and unlikely reconciliation that close the novel feel contrived. You'll learn fascinating things about the comic book business, but you won't get the masterpiece novel you've been promised."
2,Very disappointed,"This to me is a classic example of a known author, who because he is famous, his work becomes sloppy and unedited.He could easily have cut out 1/4 of the book and tightened things up. He drags the characters all over but I never felt like I got to know them. Also the period piece stuff felt really forced. Like he's saying: Look everybody it's the 1940s."
2,Say what?,"I don't consider myself a lightweight when it comes to reading books. I have plowed through many boring books, usually non-fiction tomes.Remember ""Giles Goat-Boy,"" by the English professor, John Barth? That was considered a good book in its day, and I did finish it. I was much younger then.Chabon's book reminded me a bit of Barth's book, with its long, drawn-out arcane descriptions that the respective authors maybe thought would appeal to the reading public.I couldn't finish Chabon's book. I found it boring, confusing, too long, and the book itself (the paperbook) was hard to hold in the hands.I notice that some people found the book really intriguing, so it's probably just a matter of personal taste. But I can say that I personally know of at least one other avid reader who also did not like this book. Diximus."
1,threw book away after reading 500 pages,"When I'll put a book in the trash rather than donate it, then I don't feel right about passing it along.It starts out okay, then it gets a little slow, then it gets disgusting. After that I don't know.I'm just guessing, but I think it got the Pulitzer prize for political correctness."
2,"All things are not ""a matter of opinion"".","Opinion may be ""amazing""; there is nevertheless such a thing as good taste and such a thing as bad taste. Good taste and good judgement will recognize that however admirable some of its qualities are, this book simply does not come together, does not form a unified aesthetic whole. This does not mean ""Amazing adventures"" hasn't other faults; it means its failure to cohere is its most significant fault. (Neither will good taste and good judgement consider Hemingway and Tom Robbins comparable, by the bye.)...Never believe ANY hype (or one who urges you to)."
1,This got a Pulitzer????!,"Hard to believe that so many other reviewers found this book worthy -- including the Pulitzer Prize jury. I was turned off by this author's resort to supernatural forces every time he got stuck on the plot. The vivid prose (hence my single star rating) carried me along, but only briefly."
1,Lasted a week!!,This lamp only lasted a week after I replaced itand has no warranty so they had screwed me up.that's more that 50 bucks thrown in the trash.
1,Misleading..double check compatability!!!,"Be careful. Double check the compatability before purchase. My search query was something like ""EVO Travel Chargers"" This one will come up prevalently in the search results. Reviews were good, concept for the device is good, price good. Then i get it and realize that it won't connect to my EVO. I get the idea that whoever set up the tags to sell this device had cross referenced popular incompatable devices in order to bump up their presence in the search queue. Thanks a heap."
1,Limited and Lame,"My son loves trucks and vehicles. I bought Twenty Trucks (which is great and fun for kids and parnets) after renting it at the library about 20 times.I Love Big Machines was suggested one I would like. I did not. The editing is abrupt and the volume oscillates. In short, frustrating to watch no matter how much your tot likes big machines (my son tuned out quickly and he has a long attention span for vehicles on film.)"
3,Best skiing scenes besides Warren Miller movies!,"The plot was survivable, the characters somewhat believable, and the skiing was incredible! There may not be any better skiing scenes on film, than the ""chase"" scene, and the final ""powder 8"" scene. Any skier would have to agree! If I were rating this just on skiing, it would definitely be 5 stars, but since it tried to have a plot, I can only give it 3! Scott Schmidt was amazing, just like in all his Warren Miller flicks!"
2,I am in love with Teri Polo,"First of all, I bought this DVD at Best Buy for $5.99 so that shows right there that it was not a huge hit with audiences. I thought that price was a steal. Yeah maybe there is nothing special about this DVD and it is just basic and the quality is not that great, but just having the ability to watch it in my DVD player is a much better alternative than VHS.I love the characters and how the develop them. Teri Polo has been one of my favorites in Hollywood since I saw her in this movie back when it came out back in 1993. Peter Berg is great as Dexter Rutecki and I like Paul Gross as T.J. Burke. How hot is Finola Hughes as Bryce Kellogg the rich and snobbish ski bunny. The skiing footage is great and breathtaking scenic views are plentiful. I realy enjoy watching this movie and it brings tears to your eye because these 2 best friends mean so much to each other and it hits you hard when tragedy strikes. I recommend this DVD and see if you can find it for a steal!"
5,Classic movie,"Okay this might not be seen as being in the same category as Forrest Gump or Shawshank Redemption, but this has to be the most loveable movie ever. I can watch this movie over and over because of all the classic lines Dexter says throughout the movie."
4,A Favorite for Years,Great movie!! Lots of fun to watch before you hit the slopes. If only it was in HD.
2,aspen extreme: great paul gross,"I admit, I watched the movie because of Paul Gross. Although the skiing was incredibe, and the scenery terrific, the plot was very poor and the potential for these actors wasted. If you like skiing, and adore scenery, this is great. If you like looking at and hearing Paul Gross being incredibly beautiful and incredibly earnest, as well as witty and charming, this is even better. However, as a travel brochure, it can't be beat, especially with The Poster and The Poster Child there!!!"
1,Wrong DVD in package!,We were SO disappointed when we opened the DVD case - and a DIFFERENT movie was in there! We still don't have Aspen Extreme. TOO MUCH TROUBLE to send it back.
2,BAD FLICK!,"The only good thing about it WAS Paul Gross as a ski instructor. No plot, and I freely admit Mr. Gross was the main reason I've seen is more times than I readily admit to. Peter Berg is annoying, and he don't look half as nice as Paul Gross..."
2,Sadly disappointed!,"I have loved the Ramsey Lewis Trio since the 1960s. This album attracted my attention because it was called ""Blues for the Night Owl"" which was one of Ramsey Lewis's songs from the sixties. It is NOT the same version. It's all done with electronic keyboards with wah sound effects! What an abomination! Some of the other songs are better ---when he does not use those dreadful synthesizers."
2,to hard to get anything done,I purchased these pants and when the got here was out of town so tried on when home and didn't fit.Tried to contact to return to no avail. Emailed from return code so could try and return twice was never able to and to late for Amazon to return.Will not purchase from this place again
3,Slight flaw in the slaw,"When this thing works, it works well -- It punches down strongly and accurately, easily leaving a mark on most surfaces. However, depending on the angle at which you're holding it, it may not properly re-engage after the first strike. When this happens, I have to repeatedly shake it or slap it in my hand to get everything back in alignment, which gets old fast. It's possible that it's a manufacturing defect in my particular device, but who knows."
3,BOUGHT FOR THE BROTHER FAX MACHINE IT JUST AINT MY CUP OF TEA,IT WORKED OUT NICE FOR THE BROTHER FAX MACHINE FAX 575 MACHINEIF YOU NEED SUCH A THING AFTER CALLING THEN TO HELP SET IT UPITS BETTER THAN NOTHING HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE SOME ONE YOU CAN FAXTOO WORKS OFF YOUR TELEPHONE LINE BACK AND FORTHSENDING INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE LINE TO SOME ONE THAT HAS SUCH A MACHINE ON THE OTHER END IF YOU HAD NOTHING ELSE YOU COULD USE LIKE A COMPUTER MAYBE AFTER SENDIND 10 SHEETSYOU WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE INK PAPER $$$ THATS MY WRITE UP ABOUT IT
5,A Man and his Car,"This is a very interesting story of a man who finds a 1948 Chrysler and brings it back to life. It is also a story of his family and how they all get involved in the restoration and it truly becomes ""part of the family"". I own a 1940 Chrysler Royal and this story, of course, was very near and dear to my heart. For a fan of old cars and of perseverance, this is a must read."
2,Ego manual instead of instructional manual,"After purchasing a 1948 Chrysler and seeing this book was available, I was pleased to purchase it and excited to get it. When the book arrived, from Amazon.com, I was initially disappointed; it appeared to be more of a 'booklet' than a book. And for twenty-five bucks, I expected more.Reading the book proved even a bigger disappointment; if I could, I'd return it for a refund. It was more a good old boy's story and rememberances than anything practical or useful.At most, this book should sell for $12. to $15. Even at that, I would not buy it after looking through it.If you want a nice story about a guy and his 48 Chrysler, buy it. If you're looking for an instructional and practical manual, look elsewhere. And save the twenty-five clams."
2,hoping for more,"I received the book and have read it cover to cover. It is an interesting read, and more so for me since I just bought an identical car. I have to say that I was hoping for a little more detail and analysis of options on the specific car. For example, since the title says restore, I thought that there might be some discussion / sources / charts of the original options, colors, fabrics, etc. I think repair, repaint and reupholster is more accurate than restore.The book is longer on the author's personal story than of the car. Given his NASA background I had also hoped for a more technical diescussion.The book is not large or long and cost [money]. If you were to pick it up at a swap meet [for less money] would be the high side of what you might pay.I'm happy to have the book, I was just hoping for more for the $."
4,A Dapper Snapper,"This is a collection of journalistic essays from Hal Crowther, also known as Lee Smith's husband. The guy is a very stylish writer who pulls no punches, and although philosophically liberal, Crowther is quite capable of pissing people off at all points of the political spectrum. His subjects are varied enough to maintain the reader's interest through 300 plus pages and although Crowther comes off as a bit of a curmudgeon, he is able to express sympathy when it is deverved."
1,BEWARE BOOKBINDERS,This awl is not tapered finely for piercing paper but has a short and stubby point at the end that has already ruined two books from a limited edition printing...which SUCKS! Save your money for a better tool- a friendly tip from one disappointed bookbinder :(
2,"Only for oldies, and old noises","This CD is a good mix of the great ladies of jazz; however the master is the original, without any ounce of technology. I have heard new compilations, and they modify the sound, for hearing as new record, not as a phone call.However, in matters of pleassure there are no limits, and there would be some one who loves it."
2,Flimsy Cord,"I had these for about a year before the cord developed a short just from regular use and storage in the included box. They had good sound and were comfortable after I got used to them, but start to hurt after long periods of use. Wouldn't buy again... They've turned me off to the small $50+ in-ear headphones for fear they'll break too easily."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for these earphones after reading the first 5 reviews, but I was very disappointed. The sound quality is weak, especially the bass; the lower grade earphones that came with my MP3 player produce a much richer sound. The only positive is that they are very comfortable."
3,"A decent performer with good design merit, but overall lacking.","These headphones weren't incredibly impressive so I'll leave the review short. There's nothing technically wrong with them, but they have low-resolution in the treble and can sound a little harsh. They don't excel at anything, and for $50-80 you can do a lot better. The design is well-done and the way they were packaged and presented was beautiful -- if only the audio quality followed suit."
1,NO REAL PUNCH,"I AM A PROFESSIONAL CARPENTER AND METAL WORKER AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS PUNCH IS VERY POOR FOR THE PRICE. I BOUGHT MINE A YEAR AGO AND AM VERY SORRY THAT I DID. IT LEAVES NEXT TO NO INDENTATION IN THE MATERIAL AND A DRILL BIT WILL SLIDE RIGHT OFF OF IT. I RECENTLY PURCHASED A STARRETT AND HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS WELL WORTH THE FEW EXTRA DOLLARS FOR AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. DON'T GO CHEAP, GET THE REAL DEAL!"
1,"Does not last long, disappointed","I purchased this a few months ago and probably used it less than 10 times, it quit working and now I have to revert to using a hammer and a manual center punch. Very Disappointed! Would not buy again or recommended to anyone."
1,This movie changed my life!,"Before watching this movie, my biggest regrets were things like my fiance cheating on me and having my business fail. After watching this movie my biggest regret in life is not watching it while eating a bowl of ice cream.That way I would have had a spoon handy to gouge my eyeballs out and fling them at the screen. I truly believe that may have been the only way to keep this craptastical piece of trash from seeping into my head and polluting it for the rest of my life."
5,The do the job right,Sticky Whitefly Trap (5-pack)I've been using these on my plant stands for years and they serve me well. It is very satisfying to see all the insects they trap. One at each end of a stand keeps my plants fairly well protected from whiteflies and gnats. They hang with a baggy tie and so are pretty easy to deal with. I try to avoid pesticides and these traps help me do that.
2,Looks like it was downloaded off YouTube,"The Air Force Story is a wonderful series, but some portions of this DVD look absolutely awful. They say at the beginning of the show that things may be a bit dodgy, but that's being kind. If you don't mind watching a lot of blown-out footage, and pixels the size of small dogs, this is for you. Oh and p.s., the bonus feature, ""Test Pilots Pushing the Envelope"" is only four minutes long, and about a million times more boring than you would think from the title."
2,Interesting but such poor editing,"While this was an interesting book and offered some wonderful ""tidbits,"" the poor editing (spelling and punctuation errors, and numerous grammatical issues) made this difficult and frustrating to read. I was surprised that Oprah Winfrey and Robin Leach offered quotes for the jacket. I wonder if either of them actually read the book and discovered how poorly edited it was throughout. I am always amazed at the quality of many modern publications. It's as if some writers barely made it through their college English courses, yet still found someone with even less experience to edit and publish their works. I hope Dr. Bader learned something from this early effort."
3,"Intense, primal Nugent (3.5 stars)","Now here's a way to complete your contractual obligation. Put out a live album of new songs that sound like you wrote them right before the show. But you know what? This isn't bad. In fact, it's better than a lot of the albums he put out after 1978. And the band plays the tunes with such vigor, you'd think they were playing the hits. Highlights include the killer ""Put Up or Shut Up"", ""The Flying Lip Lock"" (you catch that title?), and the song with the best title of all time, ""My Love Is Like a Tire Iron"". You also get a smoking version of Wilson Pickett's ""Land of a Thousand Dances"" and a cool instrumental in ""The TNT Overture"". And how could you not love the all-out silliness of ""I Am a Predator""? Granted, this isn't a classic in the vein of Double Live Gonzo. However, if you're a fan of the Nuge, you'll dig this."
2,Fairly worthless live album,"I just listened to this in it's entirety today but had heard a couple from this on the radio over the years and really it's not worth wasting your money on, to tell the truth. I am a huge fan of Ted's guitar showmanship and even though I have almost all of his studio albums, I don't find myself returning very often to them because his lyrics are stupid and sexist and just aren't very intelligent. Not that I'm saying that I have to have extremely intelligent lyrics like you might get from Rush, but Nugent's stuff is so dumb he looks like an idiot a lot of the time. This INTENSITIES IN 10 CITIES is about the bottom of the barrel for old Teddy and I am just a few minutes away from selling my copy of this here on Amazon. I have such an extensive collection of all types of music that I don't need this taking up precious space I need for more valuable cd's. JUST SAY NO TO THIS!!!"
2,UGH -- don't waste your money on this one,"As others have said about this album, it's no Double Live Gonzo. Crummy songs (new songs, never recorded before), poor quality (production is very weak, a recurring theme on Nugent's albums after ""Cat Scratch Fever""), all in all a bad album. I bought this when it came out, but didn't play it that much.Stick with his first album, ""Ted Nugent"", and ""Cat Scratch Fever"", and you'll be doing all right."
5,Crazy for Blood Crazy!!!!,"This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a long and terrifying ride on the Simon Clark roller coaster. This is by far the best!!!! horror novel to come out in years. The book grips you right from the start and never slows down. It's a wonderfully frightening story with great characters. When Curt and his sicko friends make the little girl and her dog ""carry the can"" I felt real anger and frustration. Many times throughout Blood Crazy I was moved to feel the same emotions as the main characters. This is not just another gory horror novel but a gripping work of fiction (if you like gruesome reading you'll get your fair share as well). Read this book! To Simon Clark...please! write a sequel and more."
4,Watch out for Mom and Dad - they'll love you to death!,"Simon Clark has written a very different book about post-apocalyptic times. One day Nick, the protagonist of ""Blood Crazy"" wakes up at his friend's house where he spent the night, heads home, and finds his world is forever changed.Totally out of the blue, all the adults in the world start killing anyone under the age of 19.Clark does a great job with character development. It is very easy to visualize Nick and all the young people he comes into contact with.There were a few disjointed areas and the book probably could have been shortened a little but all in all, this was a blood and guts, thought provoking book.There was a very creepy scene (to me) early in the book where one of the adult killers (a Mr. Creosote) was lying on his side on the ground, head propped on his hand, just waiting for the young prey. For some reason, visualizing him casually lying there was scarier to me than if he'd been standing with an axe."
1,Foo.,"A truly disappointing read. Pages turn and pages turn...and very little happens. Could have been an interesting novella, but the story's been stretched over nearly 400 pages. The pacing is so slow, that I found myself skipping ahead fifty or sixty pages, only to find that I could still keep current with the tale. Another fifty or sixty-page skip...same thing. And the laboriously doled-out explanation--when it comes--could have been summarized in a couple of sentences.Thus I say: Foo."
4,"Intense, Gripping Horror","I recently had the urge to start reading horror novels - typically they're really not my style but since I've started wandering the horror sections, I stumbled on some really good authors and novels. Blood Crazy is one of them.The premise is pretty simple - take The Stand, cross it with Lord Of The Flies and you pretty much get the idea. What makes this work, however, are strong characters and an action-driven plot. Clark develops well-rounded characters that readers can actually care about. And while a lot of the action in the book is pretty disturbing, there's some definite emotion here. Clark fuels his story with fast paced action and some very intense imagery that's very easy to get caught up in.All-in-all, I find it hard to believe that Clark isn't a little better known outside of the horror genre. He's obviously talented and deserves more recognition."
3,Adult writes and thinks like teenager.,Good book. Not really scary but very disconcerting in places. I was most impressed with Clarke's ability to write from the teenage point of view. It reads as though a teenager wrote it and the transition of the main character from a unmotivated nobody to a driven somebody is very indicative of the behavior changes a tramatic experience brings to a kid of Nick's age (I'm a teacher). I guess I'm impressed with the psychological aspects of the book as much as the story telling. I'd love to see the movie and I'd like to see the Hamer studios of London produce it.
3,Interesting,Blood Crazy started off kinda...well abit corney. In one sentence it describes a mother-with what we thought-kissing her baby only to be told she was eating the babys face.In the midst of total chaos and walking zombies the town bully still has the time to take a kids eye glasses and tease the child with try to get em. I sorta had to chuckle. Then it picked up. A good story of survival and a mans battle within his self to be responsible.It also relates to CR Jung and the conscious and sub-consious mind. Which was a very interesting factor to the book.
5,I loved it!,"I like how this book is written in the modern language and it is easy for people in our generation to understand. It's a real page-turner and very fast paced. I absolutely loved it and it reminds me of the ""Living Dead"" movies, which I love! I couldn't put it down and I like that for once, the children are not the actual problem. It did seem a little odd in the fact that they never axplained what really happened but I like it because it leaves and open ended question; Who are we really? What could happen tomorrow?, Can we do it?"
2,Psychotic Hemoglobin!,"The world's adults go nuts and start killing their own kids and anyone under 19, which ends with a hokey, new aged, feel bad explanation for human existence and destruction. The ""shocking"" answers, were more irritating than anything else. And I was constantly distracted by the main character's ability to mesmerize and score with every girl who crossed his path. Not recommended for anyone over 30!"
4,gory and thrilling,"I am unashamedly a fan of Simon Clark. Blood Crazy is fun, frightening, heartrending, gory, and always entertaining. Did I mention gory? I hate gore. But Simon Clark's books are so entertaining that I just close my eyes and skip right past those parts that are too hard for me to read. If you enjoy zombie/PA/disaster tales, you will enjoy this book."
5,Wonderful!,"A very good and fresh take on the end of the world novel! ripped off by S.King for his inferior book 'cell' this one will keep you turning the pages as you rush head long to get to the ending....the battle in Ireland heard over the radio is epic! I will NEVER forget this book. I got the softcover...try to find a copy, you won't regret it."
3,"Enjoyable, but nothing new","This was the first book I read from Simon Clark (I've read 4 since then). I found this to be the weakest of his books. Too much wandering and too many coincidences to be believable for my taste. Nonetheless, it is well written. For new Clark fans, I would recommend trying ""Darkness Demands"" first - a darker and more mature novel."
4,Great product!,"I love my new Bissell 3300P Go Vac! This baby is a great product and you certainly can't beat the price- what a deal! This is identical as the Bissell 3300 Go Vac delux except it's purple.It took me about three minutes to assemble it when it arrive and overnight to fully charge the battery. It can be converted to a hand vac easily, it's light weight and compact, a lot more powerful than I expected and certainly is easier to handle than my old dirt devil. It works beautifully to pick up the stuffs on my laminated floor, pergo, hardwood, not as great on tiles but acceptable. I still need my regular vacuum but my regular vacuum can not replace the ease of use this little thing has."
3,Poorly Written/Translated,"While this book is described as being an introduction, it leaves allot to the reader to figure out on his own. The book begins introducing concepts and commands without ever explaining what they are or what they do. If you can strugle through that, it is in later chapters that these concepts are explained in more detail.To be fair, perhaps not having previous SAP experience and the basic knowledge that comes with it is hindering my understanding.This book was first written in German in late 2000 and only recently translated into English. Perhaps there has been something lost in the translation."
2,Installation CDs in this book were not well documented.,"I tried to use CDs to intall Mini-SAP enviroment, I failed many times. The instruction for installation is no clear(e.g.you need to figure out how to set up your system variable, then you can place MBS.R3S at right place; the instruction ask you to insert DATA CD, you will never going to find this CD)There are many bugeres on 1st CD(e.g. HELP function never works)The following is the error message i got during the installation, I have no idea how to solve this problem. Could someone help me out?-----------Info: DBR3LICENSECREATE InternalInstallationDo 2 1Create SAP license table.Error: DBR3LICENSECREATE InternalInstallationDo 2 1See logfile dev_slic for further information.Info: DBR3LICENSECREATE InternalInstallationDo 2 1See logfile dev_slic for further information.Error: DBR3LICENSECREATE InstallationDo 2 1Phase failed.Error: Main {} 2 1Installation aborted.------------------------------"
4,Good reference book,Worth the money if you are new to ABAP. I have some experience and I still find the book useful.
4,Good for already programmers,"This book was assign by the professor to learn SAP programming and the class is designed for non-programmers. The book is excellent if you are already a programmer and familiar with terminology. My husband is a programmer and he can glance at the book and understand very well, but I am just a student and it takes me a long time to put the entire lingo together and make sense of it. It is not working very well for my class because our assignments (little programs) sometimes differ from the book and that is why only a programmer would have the advantage to use the book and take from it what is useful to create other programs."
4,"For those that get ""No changes on SAP objects allowed""","If you get the ""No changes on SAP objects allowed"" then check CD1 for the mbs_patch1.zip file. Check the readme.txt file inside the zip file. It will fix that error. Took me a long time to find out how to fix the issue thought i'd share in case you run into the same issue."
2,I agree that the install is no easy task,The main reason I bought this book was the fact it came with a system where one could practice writing code. I feel this is the best way for me to learn a programming language. I tried installing this with many older versions of Windows but could never get this to work. The book isn't an easy read. I was somewhat disappointed with this book.
5,Sharpen your ABAP skills,"As a SAP professional for 16 years I have seen a great deal of change both in functional and technical areas. This book has helped to seamlessly guide me through the transition from conventional ABAP to ABAP objects. I certainly recommend this book to newcomers and veterans, and should be in the reference library of all Abapers."
1,Software included (minisap) does not work with XP?!,"Book seems to be all right at first!The software that comes along with the book, does not work with windows-xp if xp has all of the latest upgrades and patches from microsoft!?!!?.The so called ""Object list"" will not show!There are patches available for MiniSAP to cure this problem, but it is impossible to get the patches to minisap witout a licence, and you don't get a licence along with minisap!!!!????What a waste off money and time! I should have read these reviews before buying the useless book and software!Shame on the SAP comunity and on the authors of this book!!!Amazon.com should warn buy'ers with ""up to date XP"" on their computer!"
4,Very useful,A good introduction to ABAP objects. Explained the usage of objects a whole lot better than the online documentation.The earlier chapters are very general though and could have been crisper.
3,Mixed Bag,"I'm relatively new to SAP, but have coded other languages (C++,Java,PHP,Perl...). Part of the problem with this book is that I don't like ABAP very much, but part is the dry, complicated explanations the book offers. I re-read a couple of paragraphs 4 or 5 times before they made sense. I think (hope) English isn't the author's first language. The combination of all this made it difficult to get through this.I tried installing installing the mini-basis system on a couple of systems and never got it running correctly (always bombed when I tried to read from database). It would have been nice, but I was able to apply the principles in the book to our dev system well enough.Griping aside, I was writing relatively productive code at work after a few chapters. So if you're persistent and have programmed before, this book can work."
1,Good luck in installing the Cd's!!!,"If you are like me a beginner in the abap ""world"", you will have great expectations on being able to install the CD, learn and practice. Well I am using windows XP, and so far have yet to succeed wiht the CD's. The help is helpless!! and if anyone knows a good reference site or tips on installing this let me know - for now I am ready to bin this whole thing. Thanks in advance."
1,BUYER BEWARE,In order to use the programs in this book you will need to obtain a developer key from SAP. In order to get a developer key you *must* have a SAP customer number ... if you do not already have a customer number buying this book will not get you one and so there is no way to work through the exercises illustrated.
5,SPIRIT(S),"Tried to write a ""snappy"" review...how it all fits into the entire history of Jazz....and wore myself out for 2 years....what it is: IS great music...good sidemen (sidepersons)Phil"
5,syringe holder,makes a real nice gift for someone who needs to carry a shot with them-great colors-good size
4,Work exactly as described,"I like having these cases to protect pre-filled syringes that will be used later on, such as on outings where it would be either impossible or inconvenient to bring all the supplies and draw from the vial.I also find that these cases help provide a barrier for when I put ice packs/gel packs inside an insulated container.I would recommend these to others"
1,"Tacky, sharp edges.","Not a good product, tacky plastic with sharp edges. The review wanted 20 words... so: don't buy it. I'm using a rectangular box that a watch came in, with a folded paper towel for padding. No sharp edges."
5,"Couldn't ask for a softer, sweeter baby sandal!","I had several wonderful sandals for my son this summer, but these were definitely THE favorite! They are soft inside and outside and cute and held up very well to tons of wearing! The only problem I had was keeping them out of his mouth!! They are so soft that he wanted to chew them!I am hopeful that I can find more of this brand/style next year! They went with anything he wore that was brown or tan and he had plenty!!"
3,love the movie .love the soundtrack,"i am a great al pacino fan, and i love scarface, so i decided to get the soundtrack , i love all of the songs especailly , ""push it to the limit."", die hard scarface fans this is a must buy."
4,Scarface (the remixes),"I am a big fan of Scarface! I've read there are two versions of this soundtrack, an original and a remixed version. I took a risk and bought this version, I wasn't sure if it were original or remixed. It was the remixed version, but I was not disappointed. I liked the remixes, they're very good in my opinion. I can't wait to listen to it in Florida! I like Florida and Scarface there for I want to listen to Scarface in Florida. I would rather have the original version and have bought it over this remixed one but I do not regret buying the remixed one. It's fun and it is short you don't have to spend too much time to listen to it all and it pumps you up!Trey"
2,Are you people on drugs?,"I can appreciate some of the great work that Giorgio Moroder has done. But this music is so dated and so bad that it almost wrecks the film. The original Scarface from 1932 has better music than this. Don't get me wrong- I LOVE the film but the soundtrack along with the 80's montage in the film are laughable. Actually I just added one star for the comedic value of listening to ""Push It To the Limit"".Push it to the limitWalk along the razor's edgebut don't look down, just keep your headand you'll be finishedOpen up the limitpast the point of no returnYou've reached the top but still you gotta learnhow to keep it80's kistch at it's worst!!!"
2,Where Is The Instrumental Giorgio Moroder Track Over The Opening?,"Over the opening montage is a great Giorgio Moroder Track, never onany Scarface CD, Any Info?? Also, sorry the updated remixingdoesn't work, They should have kept it like the original soundtrack only remastered!"
1,Whoa and ..........,"I was not aware that this is a ""re-mixed"" version, there is no description provided by the seller that said so.I am very disappointed with the soundtrack and amazon's apparent lack of info on the product.I feel that I was 'baited and switched'..... BEWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE BUYING, READ THE REVIEWS! (my mistake)"
2,Could do better in this price range,"I've had this hair dryer for a while and the biggest issue I have with it is that regardless of the heat setting, it dries out my hair. Badly. Also, the attachments have a tendency to fall off which is a problem when you're mid-drying and it's too hot to put back on. I'm finally getting around to replacing it so that my hair stops getting damaged!"
2,Took it back,"I don't know if the dryer I bought was just defective or something, but it was loud and put out very little air for as loud as it was. High speed was not a high speed. Air leaked where the cord attached, so back it went. Bought a Conair online and am very pleased with that."
5,good,"We bought it not long ago, about a month. My wife like it! it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed) the sound is ok I guess. hope it will work for a long time."
3,It's ok,"It works good, dries my hair quickly with adjustive speed and tempratureBut a bit too long and heavy to handle, especially with the filter, tiring for my armAnd it will be better if the handle is foldable"
4,A Consumer Report Recommendation,I usually look up Consumer Reports on most of my purchases. Over the years they have proven to be trustworthy and my purchases at their recommendation has saved me money and headaches. The Revlon hairdryer has just been purchased but I like it already. It is priced affordably but has many options and handles easily. Not disappointed in the least.
1,Horrible,I bought this dryer based on reviews. I have had it about 2 months now and every time I use it the handle gets so hot that I actually get 1st degree burns on my palm. I am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer. Stay away!!!!!!
2,Faulty electric cord connection,"I have had 2 of these. After about a year, first one burned a hole in the cord where the cord and handle meet. I made the mistake of replacing it with the same model hair dryer. This hair dryer only lasted 6 months and the electric cord started becoming detached from the hair dryer on the inside, causing interruptions in air flow while drying my hair. After 2 with bascially the same problem, I chose to replace the second one with a Conair. Hope to have better luck with a different brand...."
1,Don't buy it,"I purchased this dryer only a couple months ago and it's already overheating and shutting off. I carefully keep the lint filters clean, but it doesn't help. It doesn't work as well as my old Remington dryer, either."
2,Too hot and no airflow,"I got this blow dryer to replace an old one thinking it was the same brand because both were around $20.This one is much much worse. The dryer gets too hot and because the air flow is not strong enough, you end up burning your hair instead of drying it. If the fan was stronger I think there would be less of a chance to burn the hair, and it would cause less pain on the scalp. Also because it doesn't really blow dry (just gets hot) it takes longer to actually dry the hair.Steer clear of this blow dryer. Not worth the pain and money."
2,Electrical problems,"I've had this hair dryer for approximately 6 months and just noticed, as others have, that it is sparking. It's really too bad, because up until the time I thought I might be electrocuted, I liked how fast it dried my hair and the condition of my hair after drying."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DRYER!!!!,"I am not sure if I got a dud one or not but my experience goes like this. For the first two months of owning this hair dryer, it did a fine job. Nothing out of the ordinary--dried my hair just fine. The last time I used it, I noticed the general smell of burning hair when I was done. The dryer did not feel overly hot so I wasn't sure what happend. The next thing I noticed was the floor of my bathroom. There was alot more hair on the floor than usual. Upon closer inspection, I felt sick to my stomach. I noticed that there were actual clumps of hair that had fallen out---including the root. They smelled like burning hair. There were sections that had 10 hairs clumped together by the burned root. I was scared. Needless to say, I am running out today to buy a new hairdryer. Because of the burning smell, I know the hairdryer is to blame rather than a medical condition or something else environmental. Do yourself a favor and purchase a different hair dryer."
1,Flames shooting,"Beware that after some use of this dryer, the cord loosens at its connection to the body of the dryer. If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately. I didn't. I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again. The next event was flames shooting out at me through the spot where the cord exits the body of the hair dryer. It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.When this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection."
1,Fire Hazzard!!! Watch Out,The 1st time the hair dyer went up in flames at the part where the cord attaches to the hair dyer I thought it was a one time thing. I bought a 2nd one and only months later the same thing happened. I am sure the hair dyer is defective so buyers beware.
1,HAIR DRYER SPARKES FIRE - DO NOT BUY,"I purchased model #RV 484 Ionic Revlon Dryer(grey & maroon color). While I was drying my hair, it sparked fire out of the back of the unit. I have read online that many people have experienced the same situation. They have contacted Revlon without good customer service. The company wants us ot pay $20 to pack it up and ship the unit in. DON'T BUY ANY REVLON DRYERS, many other models have done the same. Some people have burnt their hair!!!!"
1,after years of good service - it went out with a bang,"I have had this hair dryer for a few years, and it has served me well up until now. Just this morning I was blow drying my hair when sparks began to fly out of the dryer, into my hair and onto the floor. In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it's end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase. Please stay away from this hair dryer unless you want to be scared out of your wits when you least expect it and risk burning off a part of your hair (or carpet)."
5,Great Hair Dryer!!,"Had this exact dryer for many years, finally cord got a break in it but dryer still worked good. Never had one last that long. Was happy to find the exact same model was still being built and received it a couple weeks ago, works great."
1,Be aware - dangerous product,"The fact that this hair dryer broke after 2 months of moderate and careful use is bad enough, but what is worse is the way it broke: IT EXPLODED in my hand just seconds after I had switched it on. I am not kidding, I still have a huge scare. It made a big bang, immediately started to smoke and damaged the electrical circuit. There was no outside trigger for this explosion at all. When shaking, the hair dryer now sounds like a box full of beans, everything is loose. I cannot tell you how mad I am that I was exposed to such a big risk! I feel lucky that nothing happened to me, apart from a life-long fear of hair driers!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this dryer less than one year ago and used it every other day. I am not a rough user and other dryers have lasted me 10 + years. On this model, partof the on - off slide plastic button cracked off , making it unusable. Button seems to be made from be less than durable plastic. The hairdryer when working, didn't do as good a job as my little travel hair dryer that is only 1250 watts.Looking at the review of others and my own experience it is a no - brainer that I won't buy this one again. Can't understand the disconnect between user reviews and my own experience versus high ratings for this model in Consumer Reports."
3,Alright dryer,"I bought this dryer becuase I needed one quick and it was cheap. The different setting selection is nice. I have medium thick hair, and a lot of it, that comes down to between my shoulder blades and normally takes me about 30 minutes to dry. It did the job for about a year till it shorted out and sparks came out of it. Not a very long life, but I guess you get what you pay for. I have had other revlon hair styling tools that lasted longer, just not this one."
1,Junk,I purchased this product and within one week there was no warm/hot air at all. Only cold air. Save your money.
1,"not strong enough, too loud",feel disappoint with this hair dryer. It's too loud and not strong enough to blow my hair. I would not recommend this.
1,Be careful!,I started out really liking this dryer but after a few weeks it would overheat within seconds and send out a spark that would actually burn my hair. It would singe it at the roots and burn off clumps of hair. Then it would be cool for a minute and overheat again. I didn't notice a difference with the Ion option but this is my first dryer with that option so I can't compare it to others. Other reviews seem to be great so I may have gotten a faulty one but be careful.
1,I guarantee this dryer will be RECALLED!,"On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair. After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy. Frankly, if you're going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them. They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.Don't buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products. They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either."
1,Another person with burned off hair,"I have owned this dryer for about 6 months. Over the last few months I have noticed the ends of my hair have been dry, frizzy and brittle. My hair has never been like this before. This morning while drying my hair, I noticed a bad smell and then saw clumps of hair with the ends melted together on the floor and bathroom counter. This dryer is a hazard and I cannot believe they are still selling them with all the other complaints I have read about them that date back to 2006! Don't buy this product!"
1,another fire...,"Mine caught fire this morning- also at the spot where the cord meets the dryer. Pop, fire, and a singed wrist... I dropped it on the floor, which is luckily tile, so it only left a black mark rather than catching the floor on fire. What is up with this dryer????"
1,My hair is falling out from this dryer!,"I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it. I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one. After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it. Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out. It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before. I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair! Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower. Please stay away from this dryer! I'm glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn't surprise me."
1,Very dangerous - do not use this produce,"I used this dryer for approximately two years and had no complaints until yesterday... Without any warning, it caught on fire as I was dryng my hair. Fortunatley, I reacted quickly and threw it down without it harming my hair, head or anything else. This product is extremely dangerous and should be recalled off of the market immediately.Revlon Amber Waves 1,875-watt Ion Dryer"
1,VERY DANGEROUS,"I purchased this dryer about 6 months ago, and today when I was using it it started shooting out sparks. I looked it up on google and this has happened to a lot of people. It's even started shooting out flames and caused house fires when it's just PLUGGED IN and not even turned on. Just don't buy it, its dangerous."
1,Crappy Blow Dryer,My wife purchased this hair dryer six weeks ago. Last week the high fan speed setting started acting like the low speed setting. The fan was barely spinning on max. So I opened it up and it looks like they used a questionable motor among other things. Turning it on with the thing open and after 2-3 seconds the smell of fried components is immediately noticeable. The electric motor is pretty exposed to dust and debris which is probably the reason that it started failing.
1,Extremely Noisy,"At this point, most hair dryers are fairly equal in their ability to dry hair. So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer. This model highlighted being quiet as a feature.Totally untrue. It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same. I will not trust Revlon again.Buy it only if you want dry hair and limited hearing."
3,Ceramic hairdryer,"I bought this hairdryer thinking it did not have the ceramic function because none of the literature said anything about it, yet when the dryer arrived, the word CERAMIC was all over it. I was hoping to get the old dryer without the ceramic feature."
1,Unsafe and Ineffective!,"I would not recommend this dryer for two very MAJOR reasons.Number 1: The ""ion"" switch is nothing more than a gimmick and anyone who reports miraculous transformation of their frizzies is most likely experiencing a placebo effect. I have slightly wavy, long, thick hair and this did nothing to either better or worsen my frizziness. To combat frizzies use a leave-in conditioner or gel, period. The dryer is adequate and dries your hair. At least mine did for about a year until...Number 2: SPARKS FLEW OUT OF THIS DRYER. BIG ONES! While in use! The sparks were accompanied by a smoky, burning smell. I dropped the thing and unplugged it and haven't used it since. This is a safety hazard and judging from other reviews my experience is not unique.LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
1,Rapid burnout,"While I really liked the dryer's performance and the flexibility of using it with either the concentrator or diffuser attachments it came with, I'm really disappointed that it's burned out and inoperable after using it (not even daily or at the highest setting!) for under two weeks.Like another reviewer, I've waited a few days and tried resetting the plug and any outlet that I plug it into (all the outlets work with other appliances) and this dryer is definitely dead after a very brief run. Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer's quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines..."
3,"pretty good product, until...","this hair dryer was a good for about a year, until today when sparks started fyling and smoke came pouring out the back. based on another review that said she had the same problem, i would not buy this dryer again."
3,Hope it works,"I just bought this dryer so I have yet to use it. I just wanted to thank all the ladies for their reviews. It helped me choose this dryer. I have been using the Conair 1875 translucent blue dryer for two years. I had to buy a new one each year why? good question, b/c it stops working. I used it last night, and went to use it this monring and ah ha, it doesn't work! It didn't fall noone else uses it it just stoped! I was going to but the Conair ion blowdryer but after reading all these reviews i said let me get away from conair, the dryer never did anything, and if you live in NY you know what the seasons are like here, I have long thick wavy hair that I dry straight, so I'm hoping this dryer really does work I'll let you know, but again thanks to all the reviews they really helped in making my purchase."
1,Ion ozone is toxic,"Ion Electrostatic precipitators release small doses of ozone as a byproduct, ozone is toxic and can eat away at the tissue of your lungs."
2,sparks flying!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I use to love this hair dryer, I even bought it twice...but both times it just nearly killed me...the first time I thought it was a freak accident..but after the second time of a flame shooting out and a loud pop and then sparks everywhere I figuring it time to switch brands..maybe someone from revlon will read this and offer a refund or a least a recall..if this had happened while i was drying my 2 year olds hair he would of freaked out and probably never let me near him to dry his hair..or worse he could of been really hurt!"
2,Doesn't Live Up To Its Promises,"I have long, curly, fine, frizzy hair that I like to blow dry straight. I ordered this dryer because the promise of smoother, shinier, softer hair sounded great. I really couldn't tell much difference in the texture of my hair with this dryer. If anything, it was harder to straighten my hair with it than with my old non-ionic dryer. It definitely took longer to dry my hair with this dryer. This dryer didn't get nearly as hot as my old dryer of the same wattage. I think the ionic button is just a gimmick. I sent this dryer back and will continue to use my old one until it dies completely."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS HOT!,"I rarely ever write customer reviews, but this one seemed to warrant it. Here goes:If you want a hair dryer that BURNS OFF YOUR HAIR AND CAN POTENTIALLY MAKE YOU BALD, this hair dryer is for you! For a waste of $18-$21 American, YOU TOO CAN BE A 21 YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH SYMPTOMS OF FEMALE PATTERN BALDNESS!!!! WOW!This little hottie also turns healthy, beautiful hair into crispy, damaged sh&*--EVEN WHEN YOU HOLD THE DAMNED THING 6 INCHES AWAY FROM YOUR HEAD!But wait, there's more!Wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body AT 6 A.M. one fine Monday morning (like it did for me this morning), and RISK BOTH BURNING OFF MASSIVE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR *AND* SEVERELY BURNING YOUR RIGHT HAND/CAUSING A FACIAL DEFORMITY VIA AN ELECTICAL SPARK! YES!The lesson of the day is: DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER/PIECE OF SH&^ OR ANY HELEN OF TROY PRODUCT IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO KEEP A NORMAL-LOOKING HAIR/VISAGE/SELF. THEIR PRODUCTS ARE D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S C-R-A-P."
2,Didn't last 2 years,"Dryer worked fine for about a year and a half until one day, it powered off mid-dry. I figured I had accidentally shut it off with my thumb (since the control buttons are so poorly placed). The next day, halfway through my drying, it sparked and smoked. It was terrifying!"
3,Decent Price for Decent Amount of Use,"I have purchased two of these dryers within the last ten years, and they worked well 75% during that time. My hair is thick and slightly wavy, and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush. The buttons moved easily, and the dryer's handle was comfortable to grip.The demise of these dryers was pretty much the same: fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here. Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal. I considered buying a third, but having generated sparks with the last two, I opted to purchase a different brand. Overall, if you don't mind the potential electrical danger, it's a decent dryer for the price."
1,buyer beware!,"I bought 2 packs of rivets both of which were fewer than expected. One was short 5 rivets the other short 3. What's the point of labeling it when it comes up short consistently? Also, when using them, the centers snapped at different points. Quite disappointing that they don't all snap as expected within the base. Aesthetically it looks bad due to the lack of consistency when some have a hollow base while others are still filled with the shaft. After reading the label closely Arrow rivets aren't designed to be used with their own tool! ""Not for use with manually operated rivet tools"""
1,"Not what I expected, and not what I wanted to find","The summary of this book sounded ok, the cover art was amazing. My brother had read it and said it was strange. Not trusting his judgement on literature I picked it up and began to read it. Unfortunately I can give you only two words to describe this book, strange, and boring.The way it is written is odd, but I could get over that. The storyline was far too drawn out and jumbled.If after you read this review you still want to try it out I suggest you borrow it from a library, you may find it's not worth your money."
4,I got it here for under 25 on a Fri sale,"I have no idea how it will wear, I have a feeling I will be sorry. on 1st look it is beautiful, wonerful styling. It is a stiff leather, not a flexible, padded shoe. Runs true to size but is not for an E foot only D."
1,Arrived Broken,Product needs better packaging - probably Amazon's fault. It arrived in a big Amazon box with very little wadded-up paper for dunnage. One arm was broken off and another was about to go. It is a good product (we have another hanging on the wall) as long as it arrives in one piece.
4,ski rack,"the racor racks are a good value. they are not fancy, but we used them in 'mud room' for ski's and other snow gear. the singles seem to work better than doubles, as ski weight is concentrated on rack center. it does take some fiddling with ski straps to get the ski's to hang at the correct height and correct distance from ski tips."
5,Wall Mount Ski Rack,This is a great value for the price and is very strong. Cleaned up my ski clutter in an instant!
1,Very poor quality control,"I bought 2 of these racks. The directions state ""Locate studs 16"" on center......pre-drill pilot holes and install rack...."". I did this but lo and behold -- for BOTH racks that I bought, the holes in the rack to drill the rack into the wall were only 15"" apart! My husband had to jury rig a bracket around the racks to be able to secure them to studs in the wall. Since I don't see this complaint anywhere else, perhaps it is an isolated case but BEWARE: measure your rack before installing it."
4,Good Value,"This is a good value for holding two skis. However, the rack itself could use two more screw or anchor points. Having only two screw points at the center of the rack makes it susceptible to twisting or tilting. So unless you are planning to mount this onto CMU or concrete, you will need to add two screws somewhere to hold the rack."
1,Plan on a trip to the hardware store,The two screws provided for mounting are long and the screw heads stripped before driven all the way. If not driven all the way then the bracket will not be mounted securely to the wall. Poor design. Headed to the hardware store to buy more screws to replace the only two originals that stripped. Also instructions say to drill 1/8 inch pilot hole for screws. This size hole would be to large. If I knew it would be so difficult to do an easy install I would have not purchased the product.
3,ski rack,"I am a new homeowner in ski country and have no experience with items of this nature, but this brand was highly recommended by a friend. The installation was easy and shipment was timely. We haven't actually used the rack yet but it appears to be adequate for our needs."
5,A Beatrix Potter must!,You young ones are sure to enjoy this very cute English tale. Some words may be foreign to them but what better way to give them a sense of the big world they live in.
5,A Stunning Achievement,"Stephen Dando-Collins weaves together a history of the 6th Ferrata Legion and Julius Caesar that reads as if it is a fascinating and suspenseful novel. Here you will find a view of the Roman World and the people who lived it, that will open your eyes to a largely hidden history that is much more intriguing than traditional accounts. It is a history that one can relate to from modern times, with its passions and political intrigue. Cleopatra's Kidnappers is one of the best volumes of Dando-Collins' four part saga of Rome's famous legions."
2,"A Poor ""Introduction.""","Don't waste your money on this one. I am a big fan of ""The Little Prince,"" and this fails to satisfy my expectations. I have a small child and I wanted her to be able to hear a simple version of this book. The story is way to simple and the pictures don't ""grab"" a young audience (an audience that would require board books in the first place). The compilation of books is haphazard in nature. I don't know who will be the audience for this book. Fans of The Little Prince will find this selection disappointing and new audiences will wonder what the fuss is over the story, and that would be a real shame. There is no message in this selection of simple books. The box is beautiful and the books appear to be well made. It will make a pretty ""literary"" accessory on my child's bookshelf...but sadly...that is about it."
2,Sparse Expensive Little Books,"Love the story of ""The Little Prince"" and love board books - our son is 1 year old, after all. But really! -Do these books have to be so thin? The only book in the set that is almost worth having is the ""I am the Little Prince"" with the French/English translations. These little books are not engaging in any way and though they attempt to be with the tabs in ""Friends of the Little Prince"" and the flap that covers the stars in ""Counting with the Little Prince"", they are not worth the price. They are almost decorative or probably more of a collection piece than they are for children to be introduced to this sweet story."
5,Great Introduction to French and The Little Prince,"I love this set and am purchasing it for my sister. My 3 year old daughter loves it as well and has for at least a year now. It's a perfect introduction to The Little Prince. Though we read the original story and also play with the pop-up version, she can't listen to the entire story, due to the length. But she knows the characters and loves this set to go along with it, as she loves pointing out the Little Prince, the Fox, the Trees, etc. I love the English/French translations as I am trying to teach her French and at such a young age, it's a perfect introduction that's easily digestible for her. I think the set is exactly what it promises to be - an Introduction to the Little Prince and I can't say enough good things about it."
2,Doesn't get any interest,"The illustrations are charming, but this board book set engenders no interest from my 4 yr old grandson. Maybe, because of all the glitzy toys out there and newer books, it is outdated."
4,History of early 1900s in small towns of Auburn & Carl GA.,"Excellent documentation of life and times in Auburn & Carl GA, in the early 1900s. Both towns were in Gwinnett Co GA at the time. Author lists members attending several churches. Many pictures are included. Of great interest to anyone living in the area, or whose ancestors lived there."
4,Excellent for the price,"These speakers are excellent value for money and a vast improvement on the standard tin boxes found for under 20 bucks. With maximum volume loud enough to wake the neighbours, and a bass level sufficient to give depth to any mp3, why waste your money on more expensive versions - after all, these ain't for your top of the range stereo hifi!"
2,wasnt what i expected,The box you get isnt the box you see. the advertisement should match the product your getting. i was dissapointed.
4,Good for home schooling,We supplement our children's regular education with some additional home schooling and this is a wonderful resource that is easy to use.
2,Geography coloring book,"In my opinion, this book is only suitable for adults who love geography.Cons :- It has a 'newspaper' feel to it because the quality of the paper is quite poor and in some pages I found the words smudged.- The fonts are really small and not consistent. In most pages the words are so small I can not be bothered to read them.- The entire book (expect for a few pages) the paragraphs are not ""justified"", i.e. all the words are aligned to the left only. This makes the book looks messy, crowded and not user-friendly."
3,Small Print,"We start homeschool on Monday, so I can't say for sure if my girls will like this book. But, I can already tell it is hard to read because the print is so small."
3,reference,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good reference materials in class/ this one was drawn in more than stated"
3,"great idea, but the recycled paper isn't ideal for coloring","Though I love the idea of coloring your way through the world, the paper quality stood in the way of this book being used. Perhaps it was just an odd run that came out on the light grayish recycled paper. This really should be on heavier, bright white paper."
2,Confusing organization,"I bought this as a compliment to a basic geography workbook (daily geography), thinking it would reinforce the concepts and be a fun coloring activity to boot. Unfortunately, it is not organized in a way that makes sense or follows a build-on-concepts kind of format. The book begins with a nice overview of the globe, but then jumps to discussing volcanoes. It will take some searching to find appropriate pages that would accompany a basic geography text. Overall, is more ""wordy"" and less ""picture-y"" than I expected."
3,To make a dull class a little more interesting,"This book is ok. It has a lot of maps, but most of them probably aren't the maps you'll need. One interesting fact about the book is it contains the flags of various countries and some other topics you might need to know for your Geography class including where certain fault lines are and pangea. Good luck with your studies"
5,Master Choi's Book is the Perfect Guide for Instructors,Master Choi's book Practical Tae Kwon Do is an excellent guide for new students and also for instructors. It covers forms from white belt to black belt with easy to follow instructions. The photos make them much easier to follow without having an instructor present. The self defenses are also easy to learn and follow and even include street defenses that an average person can use. For those more serious it also has sparring regulations. Whether you are interested in learning more about Tae Kwon Do or own you own school I would recommend this book for good reading and as a guide to have on your bookshelf.
4,The search for MLK's killer,"This book is investigative journalism documenting the search for Martin Luther King's killer and the facts surrounding the case.Other information that should be added to/corrected in the book's description:Publisher: BantamYear: 1973Published by arrangement with Doubleday & Company, Inc.(Note that Doubleday published their edition April 1972)Bantam book code: Y7156Original cover price: $1.95Pages: 557, which includes an extensive 20-page indexSize: 4.25 x 7 inches"
5,awesome!,"These cheap twenty dollar headphones are just as good as my BOSE headphones! The sound is absolutely amazing, the bass, the quality, everything! There's no hiss and they're very loud if I want them tobe although at low to medium listening levels they work great as well!They're very convenient since they fold so compactly and they're very comfortable on my head.This is a MUST BUY!"
2,Good sound - but you need a big head!,"The sound quality coming out of the headphones is pretty nice. However, if you are using headphones while doing an activity then prepare for them to fall off of your head. I used them while mowing my lawn, and I had no luck keeping them on. Finally I ended up putting my ear between the clip and ear piece so that they stayed in place. If they wanted me to use this technique then there is really no need for the part the goes behind your neck. These headphone are way too wide, and there is no way to adjust them smaller. These are great if you are sitting down and listening to music, but if you are on the move then go with something else."
1,Premium Behind Head Headphones,These headphones suck! They do not stay on. Although they are nice and compact and you can fold them...they are made way too wide. Save your money! You will spend more time during your workouts hoping that they stay on your head. The music is even harder to hear for this reason!
1,These are screamers,"I bought a pair of these hoping for the best. I wanted a set of folding, behind the neck phones for travel. Typically, Altec-Lansing products tend to scream at you with enhanced highs...but your ears adjust and then they sound pretty good. These are the exception. These babies really scream, and the lower end doesn't hold up like on most Altec-Lansing products. In a word, ""awful"". After forcing myself to do some extended listening to see if they would come around, I couldn't wait to chuck these babies in the trash."
2,"Good, but not great","Not one of Dyango's best recordings. I like his earlier recordings, but this one simply did not hit the spot."
3,Honor preserved?,"If written today, I'm certain that Dress Gray would be even grittier. That being said, for the time it was published, it was an impressive review of West Point. The mystery surrounding the death of a cadet causes the underbelly of the military academy to be exposed and one of its most loyal cadets to question his views.Well presented and thought provoking (although in dire need of better editing.)I do believe the basic honorable qualities of the institution are preserved but, again, the reader may come away with a differing opinion than mine on that point. The author clearly has a negative view and that bleeds into even the obvious attempt to present an unbiased view. I guess it all depends on what the reader's view of military academies in general and West Point in particular might be. Mine is very supportive so I can and did come away from this with an unchanged view: Those academies, thought targeting honor, are run by humans some of which may be honorless."
4,Gives superficial overview of academy,"Although this book gives superficial overview of academy, it does bring back memories of the place The good, the bad and the awful. I will always rate a good book about WP as a good read- Class of 75"
4,A good place to start,"I bought this book only because I though the sequel sounded interesting. But Dress Gray held my attention better than I dreamed it would. My only complaint is the frequent over-use of foul language. The laungage may give a level of realism, but in my opinion, it took away from the plot."
2,"Interesting storyline, but...","The author is clearly not fond of his alma mater, and I find it hard to believe that such high-ranking officials at the Academy would be involved in this type of coverup. In any case, this is a fast, easy read, and will certainly entertain.PS: I certainly hope the publishers have fired their proofreader; there were literally DOZENS of typographical errors in my copy."
3,Hard read for anyone not associated with West Point,"This was a good book, even though some ideas were a bit far fetched (evil com, for example). I think in order to truly appreciate this book, you have to be somehow connected to West Point (a cadet, a grad, or an officer/NCO who lived there). In other words, don't read this book if you are a candidate hoping to know what West Point is like because you will come away empty-handed. Finally, there is foul language in this book; however, I doubt Truscott was trying to tip toe around things when he wrote Dress Gray. The language helps paint a clearer picture of cadet life.ES, USMA '02"
2,Not worth the effort or money.,"I bought this book because a friend had recommended it and I read the reviews posted and thought I might learn something about the Academy and enjoy the book at the same time. I learned LITTLE that I wanted to know about West Point and spoke to West Pointers who said the book was highly fictionalized for effect quite often. I think the guy must have learned something there because he doesnt write badly, just not well enough to get me to buy another of his books. AND I have a hard time imagining Lee, Eisenhower, Grant or Buzz Aldrin having such filthy mouths as just about everyone in this book! Pointers I spoke to said the school frowns on talk like that."
1,Whinny,"I read this book awhile back and I was not impressed. Truscott sounded like a self-righteous and bitter crybaby who probably should have spent his college years back in the 60's with all the other hippies. I am sure West Point has its problems but the way that Truscott eviscerates the school you really have to wonder is it that bad? I also did not get a good sense of what the school was like for the cadets. I mean apart from plebe year how was it for the average upperclass cadet? If you want to read a book about a military college that celebrates both the good and the bad evenly. I recomend The Lords of Discipline by Pat Conroy. A Sense of Honor by James Webb. Or even the Academy by Ed Ruggero. West Point actually banned this book for 20 years, and probably for the first time my life I can probably say that I agree with a book banning."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this movie because I really enjoy mockumentary movies. I was hoping for a Christopher Guest-type movie. This movie was supposed to be about the funny things that happen at garage sales. Instead, it was a series of ""talking-head"" scenes in which people display their odd personalities. If it were funny, I would have been okay with that. It was not. There were a couple funny scenes, but overall I would recommend you skip this movie."
3,What a Bore,"I really didn't like this one. I tried so hard to get into it, but had to always force myself to read it in hopes that I would finish it and be able to start on something else. The characters were dispassionate and boring, cruel and heartless, thoughtless and confusing. I don't think I took anything valuable away from reading this novel."
3,"Good, but not as good as Vol. 1","This is still better than average. After all, there are not many good Nu Jazz CDs today. Jazzelicious did a good job on Carmen McRae. It does not sound like old classical vocal jazz. Some people may think that it is not based on Carmen McRae, who is famous for straight vocal jazz."
4,Great music for anyone,Great music. Extremely sexy and unlike anything else. It's great to see a CD come out with such great musicianship and songwriting rather than just another pop act. This music is great for making love or getting over heartbreak. I definately recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates real music.
1,"Poor quality, poor performance","The first time I ordered these clippers, they were doa out of the box and had to be returned. When the new pair arrived, I found the performance so lacking that I returned them as well. The blades are too narrow to do the job quickly, and the clipper guards actually gouge into your skin. Avoid these clippers at all costs!"
1,"Vidal Sassoon's VSCL828 ProSelect ""Professional"" Clipper",Have owned these clippers for 6 months and the use was frequent. My experience hasn't been positive. Started off when I noticed the blades weren't sharp. Now after 6 months I discovered the internal springs fractured rendering this clipper unusable. Be warned; Initially I read the warnings but choose to ignore. Quality is poor.
4,Good Information and lots of pictures!,"I like this book because it has an assortment of makers and not alot of history. There are alot of pictures and values which is what I am looking for.The pictures are clear. Most jewelry books seem to have inflated prices on the values of the jewelry. This book doesn't seem to be to far off base.But I'm no expert!I also like that there is a section on ""Fakes"".To bad it has to come to that!It's a good book so buy it!"
5,Good jewelry collectors book!,"This book covers a host of costume jewelry, better than average photos of the manufacturer's signatures or maker's marks (very important if you are a collector!), along with good descriptions and some pricing information. Included in the back of the book are copies of some of the original advertisements for some of the jewelry. Good stuff! I'd recommend this book if you are a collector."
2,Inside the Jewelry Box -,"Ann Mitchell Pitman has included numerous pieces of jewelry in her book, from a wide array of designers. However, the photograpgy does not do the jewelry justice, and the lack of dating for most of the pieces is no help for the beginning collector. With all of the excellent books being published these days for collectors of costume jewelry, this book would not be my first choice."
5,"""Must Have"" Resource for the Costume Jewelry Collector","Fabulous resource for the casual collector to the experienced dealer. Covers a wide variety of lesser-known jewelry makers, complete with gorgeous photos showcasing each line. Best of all, has pictures of old advertisements complimented by the actual jewelry advertised. The list of resources in the back is quite helpful to those wanting to buy or learn more but not knowing where to start. Buy this book and broaden your knowledge of costume jewelry - you will be a smarter buyer and more informed seller."
5,A Beautiful Book for Jewelry Lovers,"Ann's book was such a joy to sit with. She has a beautiful selection of jewels and lots of little known information about various manufacturers. Written in a warm style (after her columns), I just had a great time reading it and absorbing her collecting tips. She has a good variety of manufacturers (some I've never heard of), and tons of pictures (with value prices). Her more than generous array of gorgeous pins and brooches from retro to enamels to you-name-it satisfied even me. My two favorite areas were the great fruit (and vegetable!) pins, and the bakelite and plastics sections. Super, super, super!! And she finished the book off with a section of wonderful vintage ads.As a vintage jewelry dealer, I have to tell you, if you are looking for a great gift for yourself, or for a fellow jewel collector, this book fills the bill."
3,Haphazard Organization,"The jewelry in this guide is mainly from the author's and apparently her friends' collections. Quite a bit of the jewelry is unidentified by company. The book is strangely organized beginning with around a dozen companies, unalphabetized, followed by sections under the headings of ""Quality,"" ""Fruits & Vegetables,"" ""Bakelite, Lucite & Other Plastics,"" ""Parures & Demi- Parures,"" ""Necklaces,"" ""Bracelets,"" ""Brooches & Pins,"" ""Earrings,"" ""Rings & Things,"" ""Pebble Jewelry,"" and ""Guilloche."" Under these headings there is no discernible organization. The book concludes with a short section on contemporary jewelry, general information on reproductions and care and repair, thirteeen pages of vintage ads, and some costume jewelry internet web sites. The strengths of this book are that the photography is pretty good and the collection of figural pieces is extensive."
5,Man it's BRIGHT!,"I was using a 3 LED handlebar mounted light. It's still there and I have it on when I ride. I ride well before daylight, so a good light is important. So I upgraded to this light. I decided to mount it on my helmet so the light would shine wherever I faced. This works great. And as I said, I still use the bike mounted LED light for additional visibility. The battery pack is mounted on the handlebar, so I use the extension cord provided. The only improvements I would suggest is a lighter weight and less bulky extension cord and a better helmet mount system. The light unit when mounted on the helmet is somewhat, but not overly heavy."
1,amazing...i don't think so,"Amazing Irv doesn't deserve the title. The only trick in this book worth practising is the levitation, it is basically the classic baldacci levitiation, re-popularised by David Blaine and shown on his recent tv special. Other than that forget it. You would be better off with Karl Fulves Selfworking table magic - 97 fool proof tricks, as these require no set up, faked props or - most important, accomplices (i mean, it's hard enough finding friends nowdays let alone stooges). Oh yeah, Diamond Jim, when are you going to republish Pocketfull of Miracles ?Sometime soon I hope."
2,... !,"I was REALLY disappointed with this book. The back of the book reads "" Be ready to create magic anytime, anyplace with this entertaining book..."" While this may be true, the majority of the tricks included in this book can only be performed with quite a bit of set-up. I had hoped that the book would provide me with magic tricks that I could perform ""on the fly"". Unfortunately, almost every trick in the book requires some sort of ridiculous set up using items that one could hardly classify as ""everyday"". Don't bother with this one. Sorry Irv, but I was not amazed."
4,hauting in my mind,"i originally saw ""the singer, not the song"" in an art theater during the summer of 1960. the film impressed me so much i can still remember most of it today. the only reason i did not rate the film 5 stars is british actors do not play mexicans well. but, the script and acting were superb. the film's message is what will haunt your mind, especially if you attend church regularly."
2,Beware!,"Careful! This film was not shot 1:33 as presented on this disc! It was shot in CinemaScope! There's a tremendous difference between a 1:33, panned and scanned presentation and the original aspect ratio!Besides, it's a British film in what appears to be a German version here. It would be bad enough to have German subtitles in a squeezed, P&S; print, but one wouldn't want Mills and Bogarde DUBBED with English titles either!Additionally, the running time indicated on this version is, I believe, inaccurate. It is definitely longer than 117 minutes.Though it has developed a cult following over the years, the film was badly received originally, which probably explains why it has never been commercially released IN English and IN the correct aspect ratio."
1,Non US DVD,"I didn't realize this would NOT play on an US DVD player,,,,so we can't see it. Can I return or exchange it/"
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Before this cd I didnt know much about Jeff Healy but WOW what a guitarist, Jeff Healy has a style which is electrifying and unlike any other. His version of While my Guitar Gently Weeps is spine tingling and the first track on the Album gets it off too an amazing start, badge and running threw the jungle are also great covers. Not a bad track on the album. MUST BUY"
1,"3"" Steel Bedrisers","These bedrisers from Homeplace Group do not fit every bedframe. There are no dimensions listed in the description. In my case, the risers happen to be the same size around as my bed frame legs, therefore, there is nothing for the risers to fit into as the picture shows. Very frustrating as I have torn my bed all apart."
5,"""Sandinista"" the best album I ever heard!","The Clash is a brilliant band. I love how in ""Sandinista"" they can explore diffrent kind of music style and still sound great. I never got bored listening to ""Sandinasta"". I'm 17 years old and I hate how the bands today are! They all sound the same and they don't take risk. The bands back then took risk like ""The Clash"" and that why i like them."
3,The Clash's Experimentation: A few decent tracks out of 36,"I didn't seem to appreciate this CD as much as the other reviewers. Yes, it was more of an ""experimentation album,"" even so it was just overall goofy. Of course, there were some awesome songs like ""Police on my back"" which sounds more like the Clash's older albums and ""The equaliser,"" a trippy relaxing dubby sounding song that is similar to songs on their album ""Combat Rock."" However, there were few songs I liked out of 36 tracks. Most of the songs sounded like something off of Barney or Sesame Street soundtrack, like ""Hitsville UK"". It's not the innovative masterpiece that everyone says it is. But hey, if you want to take a chance, there are a few keepers on this two disk set."
2,The nadir,"When I think back on the first time I heard this album, I remember saying to myself, ""That's it. It's truly over. Punk, Clash, everything is gone"". This gruesome, indulgent, unnecessary and plain awful album was the nail in the Clash's coffin, as far as I was concerned. Somewhere in all these tracks is a decent e.p., if you remember those. ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Washington Bullets"", ""The Call Up"" are okay tunes. If I could find three or four others, maybe there would be an e.p. On the other hand, just looking back at the songlist on this album is depressing me over 20 years later."
4,OUCH!!!,"I got Sandinista! today, I loistened to it as soon as I got it home. All I can say is ouch, my head hurts. I tried to pretend my skip button wasn't there, but couldn't help it. If I force myself to like it I will, it worked with Combat Rock. Well now I am listening to the The Clash's early stuff. What a contrast!! SO if you think London Calling is too out there, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!!!! If you like one type of music don't bother, you'll listen to maybe 4 or 5 tracks. If you like the reggae punk pop disco hip-hop rap dub what ever else Jonesy and Strummer wanted to through in, you'll love this album."
5,more than just music (which is the problem most people have),"First off, this album is amazing. It's just presented in a bad way. It comes off as being too jumbled and because of that your average music fan won't take the time to really listen to it (not just HEAR it, really LISTEN to it). Sure, what The Clash could have done was selected the best 1/3 of the songs and made the album with only those songs, and it would have been presented as a much better album. But this was an experimental album. The Clash were interested in so many different music styles and this was the album where they were going to try them all. Some are hits, some are misses, I will admit. Things like children singing ""Career Opportunities"" just isn't worth my time, but this album is more than just about music, it's about being creative. I can easily understand why people would not like this album, and if you're not ready to do more than just simply hear this album, it may not be worth your time."
4,Worth the cost,"While it probably isn't worth 5 stars and you won't see it on many ""Top 100 Greatest Albums"" lists, Sandinista! is still WELL worth the price and quite an entertaining listen.If you've been able to successfully sit through RHCP's post-1990 albums, either of Sublime's albums, or the The Rolling Stone's Exile..., you can probably handle this. And unlike those albums, there isn't any misogynism or hedonism in the lyrics. You may not agree with the Clash's political stance (and I must admit that I sometimes don't), but at least they're trying to make a positive impact on the world.If you are listening for the first time, it helps to view this as a double album with a bonus LP (tracks 7-18 on the 2nd CD) thrown in. Once ""Lose This Skin"" starts, the record becomes pretty weird and surreal. It's still entertaining though. I recall listening to both discs straight through while cleaning out my house, and it really did seem to make sense."
4,The Clash widenes even more,"This ablumb is great. Its kinda long to sit down and listen to it all in one setting though. The reggae, dub, blues, hip hop, all just sounds great. With tunes like crooked beat, Something about England, Kingston Advice, and Somebody Got Murdered a purchase of this album is truly recommened"
5,What happened to music like this?,"I was one of those punk teens in 1980 when ""Sandanista"" came out and changed my mind about what punk could accomplish. It was more than three chords, it was THE WORLD. Tracks like ""The Call Up"" and ""Broadway"" hypnotized and ""The Magnificent Seven"" just hipped. The CD version takes away the chore of flipping all those sides. But where is Tymon Dogg now? I wish the bands of the Zeros were this musically and intellectually deep. A masterpiece."
5,Must Have,"Is there a rock song that can compare with Charlie Don't Surf? Maybe I'm So Bored With The USA, but the list is short. If you don't own this, get a copy from someone along with The Clash and London Calling and call it quits."
3,Not a very good album,"This album is weakest Clash album I own. There is good material on it , but only enough for about one LP, not the three this album was originally released on. Get the album, but not before you've got all their other stuff."
2,There's a GREAT single disc here ...,"The Clash went around the bend on this one. No one could ever accuse the band of standing still, but this is a case of experimentalism run amuck. The best tracks here, ""Magnificent Seven,"" ""Somebody Got Murdered,"" and five or six others, stand with the rest of this fine band's work. Unfortunately, they felt they had to release EVERYTHING they had at this time (it was a TRIPLE album on vinyl), so there is a lot of downright boring stuff here. I can never get all the way through either disc - I have to program the best tracks on the CD player to avoid getting really frustrated by this one."
2,out house,"The clash blew it on this one.After the overwhelming success of london calling,they had the record company in their hands.What we got as a folow up was a totally waste of vinyl at the time.I remember hearing this being played at the record store thinking it stunk.I thought 20 yrs. later maybe I'd enjoy it more.This album ruined the clash.They had to record a sell out album like combat rock after this garbage.I actually like combat rock way better than this (...).I give it 2 stars for 2 good songs.I couldn't even finish listening to it,so maybe there is another hidden in there.I'm glad I got it as one of my free selections for joining bmg and not the full price."
1,Two Words: Horrie Bull,"Listen, I love The Clash being that they blazed a path for other new punk bands such as Rancid. But This CD is heinous and you would have to be a REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY big fan if you actually want to purchase this. I've heard better sounding music on MTV for Christ's sake. If you want to buy good clash albums, get their first one, give 'em enough rope, london calling, super black market clash, or their live album. The Clash rock hardcore, but call Sandista ""the only album that doesn't matter."" (Unless you're tone deaf or you're a poser and buying it because it's ""THE CLASH"") The only reason I gave it 1 star is because it's The Clash."
5,Amazing triumph by the legendary Clash,"This is an absolutely amazing album that should be owned by everyone who is interested in the Clash or a vast scope of good music. The Clash transend the musical barriers imposed by genres and commercial limitations that are so effective today--especially in the punk genre. By preforming in a variety of styles the Clash tell us that punk is more than a style of music-- it is a deeper message encouraging change, that is best empowered by music. If you do not have this album, pick it up. Not every track is my personal favorite, but after listening to it with an open mind I have discovered new musical interests and expanded my own perspective on music."
4,HIDDEN GEMS,"THERE ARE GEMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RUINED BY RADIO PLAY. THEN AGAIN, THE CLASH HAVE NOT GOTTEN THEIR DUE. SONGS; ""UP IN HEAVEN,"" AND ""POLICE ON MY BACK,"" ARE STUNNING EXAMPLES OF THE BAND'S ""POWER POP"" NICHE. THE CLASH HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE DARK CLOUD OF ""SELLING OUT,"" BUT WHO CARES? THESE GEMS SOUND GOOD, FEEL GOOD, AND SIMPLY, ARE GOOD! OH, IF ONE LIKE'S SOME REGGAE, THEN SONGS; ""VERSION PARDNER,"" AND ""THE CROOKED BEAT,"" SANG BY PAUL SIMINON WILL BE OF GOOD FLAVOR. AS FOR ""LOOSE THIS SKIN,"" TIMON DOGG, AN OLD SONGWRITER PAL OF STRUMMER SANG IT. ACCORDING TO STRUMMER, TIMON DOGG TAUGHT STRUMMER HOW TO PLAY BEFORE THE 101'ers DAYS (TROUSER PRESS, CHRIS SALEWICZ). THIS CD IS WORTH THE MONEY."
4,great album,"i'm one of those untrendy people who doesn't think the clash's first album was their best. i think give 'em enough rope, london calling and this album are their best albums. the thing i like the most is the growth involved. i hate it when a band records the same album over and over and the lemmings just go by it. this is a great album full of various flavours that i found sat together very well. sure there are a couple of songs that aren't fantastic, but so what. great album, buy it, put it on, close your eyes and listen to it.i also don't know why people don't like combat rock, i reckon know your rights is the best song they ever recorded"
3,"some great songs, but ....","This is not a five-star album. ""London Calling"" is a five-star album, heck, it is a six-star album. ""Sandinista"" suffers in comparison, although it is not without its moments.It was conceded by the band that they went into the studio without much prepration, and it generally shows (what with the constant touring, no one can blame them). What we get in the end is a few great songs (Police on My Back, the Call Up, Washington Bullets), several pretty good songs I still like to listen to (Junco Partner, The Leader), and LOTS of unfocused experiments and jams that don't hold up too well. I got this album out the other day and found myself skipping about half the songs; they were just boring or bad.The album justifiably won praise at the time of its release for its embrace of so many types of different music, and the Clash was certainly one of the most versatile bands around. I just wish the album had been more consistently good."
4,A bit too long,"Loved the music, hated the politics. Would that have offended Joe Strummer? I hope not. Their music stands by itself. And while this album was a bit too long, it still represents a great album one of the greatest band of all-time. RIP, Joe."
4,Interesting and experimental.,"SANDINISTA! by the Clash is a triple album and contains a tremendsou amount of music. As the Clash was a very experimental group that liked to work with many different kinds of music, this album gave them the chance to risk a lot of different ideas. And a lot of these ideas worked. There are a lot of good songs on here. But there are also a significant number of disappointments, too. Overall, the good far outweighs the bad, and this is a good album to listen to."
3,HALF CLASSHED,"I miss Joe Strummer like you would not believe. The Clash were a vitally important band. Sandinista was their everything and the kitchen sink album. It's half a masterpiece. It's half a disaster. You know that function on your CD player that you never use, that allows you to sequence the songs you want to hear. You're gonna need that. Although I'm betting that no two people would choose the same songs. Mine would go something like this:1) The Sound Of Sinners2) Police On My Back3) Somebody Got Murdered4) Washington Bullets5) The Leader6) Corner Soul7) Midnight Log8) Junco Partner9) Hitsville UK10) Up In Heaven (Not Only Here)Then you really have something. They should've left the dub experiments in the vault for release on the deluxe anniversary edition. Still the aforementioned songs are among the most searing they ever wrote. So get it and program your own masterpiece. It's half the fun."
4,Follow up to a classic,"If you are looking for London Calling again, this CD is not it. The Clash branched out into other musical forms for this 3 record set. I was 14 at the time this came out and living in London's west end, and the music fit perfectly at that time. Some songs now are a bit aged, and some are just not that good, but as a whole, I think this record set showcases a band taking a different direction and it is one I will keep in my collection."
2,"It's warm, it just doesn't blow.","It is weak! Yes, it's hot, but the flow of the hair dryer is very poor. No wonder it's quiet. Because the 1875 Watts is being used to generate heat, not blow air. It was pretty disappointing....."
3,How About attachments??,"I like the ""quiet hair dryer"" but does anyone out there know where I can purchase a difuser a styling attachement for it?? Please let me know?!"
4,dora bike,I was very disapointed with torn up box and missing bolts from shipping which makes it even worse when there metric! grandaughter still loved it though even with scuffed paint. still a good buy in my book.
2,Poor,"Product was dirty and scratched upon delivery. No fault of FED EX. Easy to assemble, but very cheap construction. Do not recommend. Made in China"
1,No,"Froze up on me, don't buy, not worth the money, spend more for quality. Shop around there are better alternatives."
1,Wonderful Experience For Me!,"Having sat through the movie with a female friend, I now know that life will only get better, since seeing this movie was the absolute worst two hours of my life. I would rather have stomach cramps for two hours than watch this horrible tripe again.I am a male - not the intended audience. I believe that the intended audience must be people with dementia. They would be spared the pain of possibly remembering even one second of this unbelievably bad movie. This movie deserves a rating of zero, plus, everyone involved with this film should be sentenced to prison.Never has there been a more insulting movie passed on as entertainment. I seriously worry about those who enjoyed it.Rating: negative infinity, the worst movie ever made."
5,great movie,I like all the characters and the story line was amusingGreat movies to watch with my daughters. Light hearted and funny
2,Is the girl having mental problems?,"I didn't find Bridget THAT cute in this story after seeing her with That strange make up in her face for that party. It was not fun, made her seems very unworthy of Mark Darcy. Both the guys were stupendous, the cad one suggesting a ""shag-a-thon"" weekend, the fight in the fountain, really nice, they ""saved""the movie. But Bridget with that make-up, the party, being in that prison where the roomates were so cultured that most of them knew English, Mars and Venus, Madonna sounds crap. The movie had too many flaws, the only thing worthy was seeing both guys fighting for her (Why anyway? She is a pathetic woman)."
2,Re-watch the original instead!,"I gave this a 2 star, only because I have actually seen worse movies out there. However, this movie was not really enjoyable at all whereas the first one was quite entertaining. And since this sequel has all the same plot, characters, and jokes as the first--only now less interesting, less endearing, and less funny, respectively...I highly recommend you to re-watch Bridget Jone's Diary instead of this one. Take my word for it, nothing new happens in essence, and any changes they made to pass this as a new movie are precisely what made it so bad."
1,No Reason for This Sequel,"Audiences who enjoyed ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" (2001) had the good sense to avoid this unnecessary follow-up. ""The Edge of Reason"" is a cynical ""romantic comedy"" with no laughs, poignancy or motivation. Another pathetic example of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy."
2,I'm gonna be a meanie,"...and tell you to avoid this twaddle at all costs-this sequel is a sequel, and as such it is a bomb. Maybe it's my invented memory that the Bridget Jones I remember from the first movie was a likeable gal...because here, she's pretty irritating and I have trouble believing that insecurity and a chunky frame is enough to hook a successful lawyer with international connections. 'Cuz that's all Bridget does in this movie-obsess and babble inside and out of her head.Zellweger does a fine zoftig but beyond that, this is a chick flick only for devoted fans of the genre. But what do I know? I'm just a guy that got made to see it."
1,I wish they would have,"just left Bridget alone! This movie just doesn't do the story line any justice. She was living happily ever after, which is where I like my favorite movies to end!"
1,You're Kidding!,"If there was a worse film released in 2004 than Bridget Jones Mark II then I'm glad I didn't see it. After watching this execrable dross it dawned on me that I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life that I won't be getting back.Yet, perhaps it was just me? Much of the audience did laugh from time to time at the often slap stick humour. I just found it predictable and tired.The original film of 2001 was fresh and at sometimes amusing. This sequel, however, showed that you can only get so much out of the one idea. Bridget Jones had morphed into an absurd caricature. She even gets stuck in a Thai jail on a drugs charge! What's more, the feeling of déjà vu when her two suitors are involved in another fight is palpable. It just wasn't funny!If you're even just thinking of seeing this film, don't waste your time!"
2,"Hey Hugh, Colin called you a big sissy!","There's really only one reason to see this movie: a recap of the great girly-man fight between Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. It's almost as funny as the first time around, with some great hair-pulling, body-slamming interludes. The rest of the movie left my mind almost at the same time I watching it, except some painful memories of cheesy looking sets and politically correct third-world prisons. Any movie set in Thailand with no filth and squalor goes way beyond comedy to a kind of propagandistic obscenity. Don't be fooled, tourists of the world, ""Edge of Reason"" is to the real Thailand what Woody Allen films are to the real New York."
3,"Love, Love, Love this movie","This movie was so great! It was so much better than the first Bridget movie. Maybe I feel this way because I love Colin Firth, but there were so many things that I really liked in this movie. If you like love stories that have great endings and make sense they you will love this movie! Watch this movie you will love it too!!!"
5,Brilliant!,"I frankly don't understand why there are so many disapponted reviews. I think the movie is completely hilarious, and is just a good an adaptation of the second BJ book as the first one was. If you are looking for extra depth in the analysis of the reasons for why there are so many singltons around, look elsewhere. This movie is a lighthearted comedy, and excellent one!"
4,I love this movie,"I dont have the dvd yet but i saw the movie and i loved it, although mot as much as the first one. I still found it funny and romantic and i will definitely buy it when the dvd comes out."
3,Not like the Book,"If you read the book Bridget Jones' Diary you might be disappointed by the movie. The book focuses more on her relationships with her friends, who are all wildly amusing and lovable characters. I was disappointed to not see more of those characters adpapted into the screen version."
2,Bridget Jones,"Ugh... Well acted, well edited, and I don't care to watch it. My wife loved this movie, and I bought it for her. She would give it a 5, but only give it a 2.What do you expect? It is a chick flick. I do admit I enjoy Colin Firth and Hugh Grant having a fist fight. It has become a trademark when they are in a movie together."
4,A Delightful Movie.,"Got me laughing throughout. Hugh Grant is hot as always, and the soundtrack is wonderful."
4,"Not perfect, but neither is Bridget!","These movies are so enjoyable to watch. While this is not as good as the first one, it is still very cute and fun. I rather don't like the last bit of the movie in Thailand and jail, but the rest is sweet. Hopefully in fantasy land Bridget is finally enjoying life w/ her smashing Mr. Darcy!"
4,"Must have liked it, I bought it twice","I hadn't a clue that I had bought this, from Amazon.com in fact, when it was first available on DVD. But when some girl friends and I were planning a long weekend at a cabin, we each were able to pick 2 movies, so I picked Bridge Jones I & II. I have to say I loved I better, as I thought II was a bit over the top with Bridge being jailed..."
4,Good movie,Enjoyed this movie. It is comedic and the cast does a great job of delivering that. Easy to identify with the characters and situations.
4,Bridget Jones-Edge of Reason DVD,"If you enjoyed the original Bridget Jones and the occassional raining men, then The Edge of Reason is a must for your movie collection or just for viewing.The sequel picks up where Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) and Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) left off, the start of a new diary, new year, and new relationship. Of course, Bridget being paranoid and self conscious, doubts herself and her new life and, well, you need to watch the movie to find out what happens next. Oh, don't forget, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) still pops up from time to time to help poor Bridget along in a mess that could or couldn't be a relationship."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST,"Finaly bridget jones has landed the man of her dreams, but can their relationship survive a sexy, meddling coworker and the return of bridget's old flame?DVD includes an alternate beginning.worth renting, not buying."
1,Just a disappointment!!,"I disagree with a previous reviewer: I found the ""Edge of Reason"" book much more palatable than the film.There simply aren't enough hours in life to waste even a part of one delineating in detail the reasons I was disappointed by this film after reading the book. Besides, most other reviewers have touched on them: the way Renee was shot SO unflatteringly; great liberties with the storyline and characters; cramming the story into too short of a running time. Enough said.Granted, this review is of the film, not the DVD iteself. But I doubt that any additional features would sufficiently overcome the movie's weaknesses to motivate me to spend money on the DVD."
3,"Not quite as good, but still fun!","The whole gang's back. Bridget, Mark, Daniel and the rest are in for another year of heartbreak and adventure. This sequel could have been a disaster in the making. The Thailand angle could have broke the film. The difference were the performances of Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. They give plausable performances and this film probably would have failed with someone else. Though not as great as the original, it's still fun!"
3,I was okay....,I love Renée Zellweger she carried Tom Cruise (in my opinion) in Jerry Maguire. But this movie did not do her justice. The Bridget Jones character was so annoying I could hardly stand to watch her. The fight scene between the two guys towards the end was the funniest part in the movie.I guess this movie was not meant for me....a guy.
5,I laughed from start to finish!,"It felt like a comical amusement ride. I couldn't stop smiling a long time after it was over. It was good to see specific side characters get attention in this film, like Magda, Jed, Giles, the ""Jellyfisher"", and of course Bridget's 3 best friends. I know that the love triangle with Mark and Daniel is rewritten, but I think it works well. And I love the way Mark fights for her in the end, not only with Daniel, but how he gets her out of the T-land jail! It was soooooo Mr. Darcy. I just wish they had shown all the work Mark went through to obtain her release. The way they showed Mr. Darcy hunting Mr. Wickham down and making him marry poor, stupid Lydia."
2,Disapointing,I loved the first book and thought the first movie was fairly well done so I was excited when I heard they were going to make a movie from the next book as well. Unfortunately this one wasn't as true to the book or as good BY FAR. If you've read the book don't ruin it by watching this.
1,talk about used,"I always buy books, cds etc from Amazon and never in my life have I recieved a used copy of a text that is in such awful condition, I can barely turn the pages- they are all stuck together and the book, well, it looks as if someone completely spilt something all over it. The sender sent a very sweet card and that is always nice. But still, this should never have cost what it did. This book is probably worth less than $10 in the condition it is."
4,Fitzgerald's Storm .... the wreck of Edmund Fitzgerald,"A great book if you're a history buff about sunken ships.I sympathize for the lost lives, but it's the drama ofhow and why it happened. Like the Titanic.a lot of history to be found and learned.Don D."
4,AND THE BELL RANG TWENTY-NINE TIMES,The fitz wreck happened 1 day after my 10th birthday and because of gordon lightfoot's tribute song i have alwayshad a strong interest about this ship.I have seen lots of documentaries and have books about it. This so far seems to be the most informative. This book gives a pretty good description of the Great Lakes especially Lake Superior background information on the crew and the investigation. The only thing I did not really like was some of the description of the feelings and the things the crew were going thru I felt there may have been a little to much speculation on ths part.But all in all are great book. The one part that always seems to really stay with me that maybe kind of haunting is the phrase from Gordon's song that says does anyone know where the love of god goes when the waves turn the minutes t hours
5,Very soft plush meerkat,"This is a very soft plush meerkat who continues to stand upright some months after initial purchase despite being through the laundry twice, stuck in the foldup bed for a week, and smashed in the back of the car trunk. A very good buy and highly recommended for the meerkat aficionado."
1,"Made in India, replacement tips don't fit.","General has shifted production of this punch overseas. If you compare a new punch to one made in the USA, you will find a remarkable difference in quality, but not in price.I suggest that you comb out-of-the-way hardware stores for older production US made punches that are collecting dust on the shelf. It may cost more, but this Indian made punch was a waste of money. I used this punch once, then the tip fell off between jobsites, never to be found again. While I was smart enough to buy a replacement tip at the same time, it doesn't fit. The screw thread size has been changed. The Indian made punch uses a smaller thread than the US made punch. Now I have a $28 punch and an $7 tip that don't go together.That was a very expensive hole."
3,3 stars see below,i only gave 3 stars not to the fault of the tool. the tool seemed to be made very well. the one i recieved was missing the tip that marks the metal. i had to return it. im sure it is a quality tool and i would buy again
2,The cloth feels like plastic not dungaree like.,"I am sorry to tell you. This morning I printed the return label and I will take it to the UPS store.The jeans LOKK OK, but these jeans do not feel like blue jeans.My wife ordered them and did not know until this moment that the cloth is Coated with some plastic.I am an old ""fella"" and I had Levis with the feel of dungarees, denim or the old type of cloth"
2,Not the same as store-bought jeans,"I purchased these 514s in the same size as ones I had purchased at a Levi's store near where I live.The quality of the ones from amazon were nowhere near the quality of the ones purchased at the local store. These ones are baggier, do not fit as nice, and also seem thinner in material than the other ones.Will not purchase jeans from amazon again. Best to go out and try the jeans before purchasing, because it seems even if its the same size/style, the quality leaves something to be desired!"
3,"Love 514, but sometimes vary by size","Most of my casual pants are Levi's 514. They've been my favorite cut for a few years now.Most recently, I order three pairs on Amazon, all 34x32: Silver Fox, Tumbled Rigid, and a standard blue pair.The blue pair has been great. The Silver Fox pair are an inch or two shorter than the other pairs of the same size. And the Tumbled Rigid don't really look very similar to what's pictured, so they're being sent back.It's disappointing that pairs of Levi's vary in size a bit by color or finish. If you order online, please be aware that you might run into that problem."
4,"Good Fit, Good Price",Got these jeans for $30 and this is definitely worth the price. I always wear these when going out with friends to something nice but not business casual.These aren't like the skinny jeans that are super tight and look like girl jeans. They fit just right (though it did hurt the crotch area a little in the beginning but got looser after constant use). Definitely a good pair of jeans to have if you have decently skinny legs.I just feel guilty getting these even though Levi makes their jeans in chinese factories that abuse young farm girls.
2,I prefer the 512s,"I'm not in love with the men's 514s. They were to replace a couple great pairs of men's 512s (which seem to be discontinued?). Anyway, the 514 material is thinner and less like original Levis. Additionally, the low-rise cut is a bit extreme for my taste. Also, the whole color name thing is just dumb! Starvos might be a Greek village, British tall ship or the name of a the Finnish game programer -- what kind of color is that? Bring back the good old 512s."
1,too small,"I bought this jean the Levi's mens 514 slim straight jean, ash grey, and it could not fit me. what I can understand is, I have the same jeans in black and it fits perfect."
4,Nice!,These jeans look great-fit well and a very good price. Not freakishly rock star low cut-but not grandpa jeans either. These are juuuuuuust right (provided you like slim fit and not baggy)
1,Hole formed in around the back pockets after only 3 weeks.,I liked these jeans and the way they looked on me. They felt good and fit good but after only a few weeks a hole started to form around the back pockets. Another week later and the hole was large enough to be noticeable to someone standing behind me. After that I came on here to try to return them since they're obviously defective/poor quality but by that time I was too late. NO RETURNS. I just spent $40 on some worthless rags... thanks for stealing my money Levi and Amazon...
4,Look and feel,"I'm 6'1"" about 180 lbs. and I have finally found a slim fit jean stylish enough to wear out with the comfort to lounge around the house. Put 'em on in the morning and you are done."
5,Levis quality,The jeans were exactly what I wanted. Levis quality was there.The fit is timely for todays fashion in mens' clothing.
2,INKY BLUE CROTCH MALFUNCTION,"I love 514 Slim Straights, I've owned several pairs in the same size. But for some strange reason, the inky blue variety fits very odd. By odd, I mean it creates a pocket on top of your crotch. I know that sounds odd, but believe me, when someone has to tell you about it, its even odder. Had it exchanged immediately."
3,514,They are very thin maybe the 514 is susposed to be but i would not have got them if i had known this
4,Mostly right...,"But lower ""hipped"" and wider leg flares than I expected. I think the picture may not be accurate. But, otherwise, a good fit, and my girlfriend likes them... On me, that is."
2,"Levi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Jean, Dirt Rush","The packaging was great, now for the Jean, the jean material was so thin. It fits good but can't really wear the Jeans in the winter time. I was not to happy with the overall quality of the jeans. Goodbye Levi's you were once a great jean company but have taken a turn for the worse when it comes to the quality and lack there of."
2,Wrong fit,"Bought these same jeans in a different wash and they fit fine. These were at least 1"" smaller in the waist when holding up to others."
2,Wrong color sent,"I ordered the Levi 514 color Kale. A faded color jean was sent. Tired of returning jeans that are the wrong color, always cut different, etc so I'll just keep them."
2,They Do Mean Slim,"These came in much smaller than a seemingly identical pair I bought in the store, both in how tight they were and in the leg length. They were basically skin tight high waters. I had to return them."
2,Thin fabric,I have another pair of these that we're made in Mexico - these from Honduras - the fabric on these is much thinner and substandard
2,Terrible quality. Twice.,"I bought a pair of these last year, wore them for a year, wore them out, and loved 'em.Ordered a new pair this spring. Two days later, split the seam from crotch to knee when I squatted down to pick something up. A wee bit embarrassing and a lot of hilarity later, I got home. About a month ago, I ordered another pair; I figured it was just a defect in the first ones, and c'est la vie.This pair is less than a month old, and split a hole in the crotch. I'm exactly the same weight I was last year and the year before; I'm a pretty thin dude. This is ridiculous, and I'm not exactly happy with burning money buying 'em."
5,Love it!,This is so perfect. Exactly what i wanted! Came exactly as described and gives me comfort and confidence when i wear it
4,as expected and came really fast,was as expected and came really fast. i love these jeans. im a bit short and overweight but found my perfect size with these jeans. I dont need to have them shortened. I just fold back the last 2cm or so and they are fine.
4,Forgiving fit,"These have that stretchy-elastic sort of fit that's snug, but would probably be forgiving after a week of beer and pizza. Unfortunately, the reality of today's Levi's is that they'll probably only last a year of regular wear, but these don't seem any more flimsy than average pair.A note if you're trying to decide between a 33 and 34 waist: it seems like the proportions jump all around between these two sizes. The 33 waist jeans fit tighter in the legs; the 34 waist is noticeably looser all around (not just in the waist)."
2,levi's 514 jeans,"I did not expect the jean's to be as thin as they are. The 512's were much ""sturdier"" jeans except you have a problem finding them in the slim cut. I returned the jeans because they would not last very long even doing yard work."
2,Not up to quality expected from Levi's,"I ordered the Levi's 514 hoping to find a slim cut, low rise jean. Unfortunately, it did not fit like a Gap jean of the same size: the waist was too small. More than that however, I thought the quality of material was much lower that what I had expected from Levi's. The cloth was lighter in weight and the construction did not look as I had expected from previous purchases of Levi's 505 jeans."
1,"I hate to do this, but...","I love these cut of jeans, I love buying from Amazon, but to put it simply, what I received was not what I ordered. Either that, or the picture is extremely deceiving.Be careful when ordering these jeans from Amazon, as it has been my experience that they do a pretty poor job sending you the style and color of jeans you actually order-- which is almost understandable given how similar all the styles are. But I ordered a pair of dark blue jeans, and I received an extremely faded and intentionally distressed pair of jeans that I would be embarrassed to wear to work. Just a warning-- Amazon screws up quite a bit, and when they do, it's a big hassle."
1,the discription is not correct,not a single word it is a STRATCH one... ha ha ha and I need 5 more words to complete this review
2,run small,I ordered a sz 38 but fit more like a 36-34 . The jeans run small so choose your sizes wisely.
2,Cheap,"Not at all what I expected. Cheap, flimsy fabric that feels nothing like true denim. I decided to try them out and keep an open mind, but after washing them I noticed horizontal lines around the pockets. Not worth the price. Amazon missed it on these."
4,really comfortable,"i like these jeans, Levis really does know how to make a pair of jeans, their comfy, fit right and sit properly all over. I would recommend them to anyone. this company took its time with shipping them out though..."
5,Great jeans,"I never buy anything but levi's because no one else continually deliver a great product that will last years of use. Great, modern looking fit."
2,Incorrect sizing...,"Generally, I'll give Levi's 514s five stars. They fit me well, and take my mistreatment (bouldering, for starters).However -- this pair purchased through Amazon is roughly two inches shorter in the inseam than every other pair I own, which are labeled as the exact same size. Guess I should have listened to the other reviewers who claim to have received ""irregulars"". If you order this product: good luck..."
4,"Quick, easy transaction, fantastic quality.","I love the jeans. They are comfortable, high quality, and good looking.I personally thought they were a bit expensive for what they were worth, but the price changes for Amazon items all the time, so it really depends. (Also, I'm not a huge clothing shopper, so I don't know what the ""usual"" price).The jeans arrived like you would find them in a store, with the measurements in a clear plastic sticker along the side of the pants, and the brown tag on the back.I don't think these jeans are ""incredibly amazing"" or ""fantastic"" but I do think they will last a long time, and look great."
2,They fit but smell like solvent,"These jeans fit well for a slim man and the fabric seems to be in good quality. However, the dye they used smells like solvent, even after many washes. I would not recommend them."
3,Levi Mens jean 40 x32,"Bob, just saying the 40inch waist was OK but I needed to get the legs taken/adjust up, was looking for a black but I've just got the wrong body. I should have been a bit more vigilant about my own specific specifications (I like the sound of that) making that type of mistake can be frustrating for the customer and the sales staff. So, I say before you/I order to make absolutelty sure of sizing (Yours and the product). This can be taken to any Item of clothing, the last thing you need is hostility to a certain sites/shops then realising they do have something or an alterate solution to the problem and discuss things in a civilized fashion. Anyway, best regards from Bob Sayer, I will be purchasing in the future guaranteed!"
1,HORRIBLE,THE JEANS GOT BROWN BECAUSE OF THE RUSTING ZIP! TOOK ME AGES TO GET IT OUT! ITS MORE CREAM THAN IT IS WHITE! IM VERY DISAPPOINTED
4,"17 years old 6'5""","Great jeans for teenager. If you know your correct size, fit is perfect. Ordered on line because stores do not carry 36 length."
4,Thin And Soft,Thin and soft. It's better for summer wearing.But I think the stylish is just so so though is a classic one.
1,looks cheap like a house painters,The material looked like canvas. I have other Levi 514 so was very disappointed as to the appearance of these jeans. Back they went.
3,514 jeans,Well made but dissapointing. Neither the waiste or inseam dimensions were as listed on the Levi lable. Levi return policies make it not worth the trouble to reject.Levi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Denim Blue Jeans
4,Was not as expected,"In the picture looks different to what it is, but I gave it 4 stars because it is not bad.As for the purchase and shipping all positive"
2,levi mens 514 jeans,The fabric is not the usual jean thickness it is very thin. This denim is very soft and does not feel like it will wear well.
2,International sizes beware,Beware if your from Australia and interested in slim straight Levis. I buy Slim straights at home in the same size but different colours and thats pretty much all i buy cause Levis are the best jeans. I thought i would take advantage of the hugely discounted prices on Amazon $40 instead of $150 in Aus stores. Beware slim straight in the US is freaking enourmous the waist fits fine but the bottoms of these jeans have a flare on them bigger than my parents wore in the 70's. If you want slim straight maybe try ordering skinny style instead. Service by Amazon was quick though and i got them in a couple of days and they are actualy nice looking Levis im just annoyed that they are way to long and loose.
2,Cheaply Made,"I don't know what happened to Levis, but these jeana are cheap. Upon the second washing, the left rear pocket tore at the seam, AND a hole started at the crotch...so much so that the jeans became un-wearable...I'll never buy these jeans again."
3,Different fit from other 514s,Interesting stretchy material but beware that the sizing is different from other Levi's 514s. The length is shorter and the waist feels looser (perhaps because of the stretchy fabric.) than the twill levi's 514s I bought at the same time....also from the regular demin Levi's I bought a couple of months ago. This seems to be a common problem with Levi's these day... oh and don't forget on most Levi's these days the fabric is lighter weight.
5,Great Buy,These jeans are awesome the colour and feel are second to none. It makes me feel sexy when I wear it.
4,great jean with two issues,1) they decolorate FAST after washing them2) They are a lot larger than a 33. It's equivalent to a 34...
3,514 Slim Straight,"So I've ordered three pair of these jeans to date (2 indigo wash, and one dark blue)I love the way they fit and the price sure is good. HOWEVER, the indigo wash style is of very poor quality and BOTH PAIRS I OWNED got developed holes in the crotch/butt area within two washes. So very thinIt sucks because I really like the jeans, but I can't keep spending money to wear jeans 5 times! I guess you get what you pay for."
4,"excellent cloth, fit perfectly","I must recomend this Jeans, the cloth is very light, soft and confortable. The fit is perfect. These possess the normal quality and durability you have come to expect from Levis. The 514, in short, they fit great, feel comfortable and look good."
2,looks good; poor quality,"I like the Jeans, they look great; however after the first wash the right pant leg above the heel shredded and then the second wash did the same to the left. Odd Jeans I thought were more hearty than that? I would have liked to return them but as I was on vacation the 30 days expired. As I was on vacation two different washing machines were used, so it isn't the machines fault, and after the first leg shred, I looked to see if perhaps it got caught on the shoe... the tear was too high, the pants definitely didn't drag... really disappointed with the product."
3,Not consistent with other 514 Slim Straight jeans,"The waistline is the same size as my 31x32 light grey 514 jeans, and the length of this pair is longer than the pair I owned which was also 32 length."
3,Nice look but bad fit compared to other 514s I've owned,I read a review that all the washes of 514 fit different. I have two pair myself and they both fit completely differently so I can attest to that. I have a pair of the black ones and they fit awesome for what I want. They fit more like skinny jeans that taper in at the ankle and fit nicely around my boots without making you feel like you can't bend your legs or sit down. They are very modern. The Dirt Rush wash however fit nothing like that. They are baggy all around and look like they almost flair our at the bottom. They are very loose all around and look like something I might have worn 10 years ago. Not a fan.
1,"No consistency anymore, you wont get the same thing twice","How can Levis give four completely different pants the same model number? It is a joke of the first order. How are you supposed to ever find the jeans you like when you can *NEVER* count on getting them twice in a row using the same model number? Who is the genius who decided that '514' should be applied to all manner of totally different pants? Who decided they should be made in disparate countries from production run to run? I will never patronize Levis again - number one they are made in Bangladesh or Columbia, number two they are literally morons at Levis, and morons don't deserve our business."
2,Do not buy!!,"I feels that i received a fake Levi's Jeans for the Levi's Men's 514 Jean, Tumbled Rigid, 33x30. There's no Levi's written on the zip and the back of the jeans(the red tag on the right back pocket. I feels cheated. Do not buy!!!"
2,"Loose through the inseam, not for skinny guys with a small butt","My physical stats: 5'11"", 135lbs, semi-athletic build. Basically a relatively tall, super skinny guy with almost no butt. I ordered the 29x32, and while the waistband and length were a great fit, I ended up returning this item because the inseam fit was just plain awkward on my body type. These jeans are actually somewhat tight around my calves, but extremely baggy in the thighs through the seat, making for a very strange look. I also ordered a pair of the 511s in the same size, and they fit much better. The denim for both pairs of Levis is unbelievably soft and comfortable, if a bit on the thin side."
4,Love the fit and style. Jean material wears out faster than average.,"This is the third pair I've bought in four years. I do like the simple fit of these Levi's. Nothing trendy. What I don't get though is that the fabric seems to not hold up the way I would expect Levi's to. After a year of normal use (e.g. wearing to work, washing and drying) the cuffs are frayed and knees and seams are getting thin. After two years the knees are worn through and the corners of the back pockets have separated. I have other Levi's that I have owned for five or six years at this point that don't have any holes. If I still liked the way they look as much as these I be wearing them more often.Bottom-line, great fit and style but they really need to get a different supplier for this fabric."
1,Buyer Beware - Factory Rejects,"These are sold as ""regular jeans"", but they are actually factory rejects. I received my pair with a bad hem and a missing belt loop. There isn't anything wrong with factory rejects - as long as you know that's what you are buying. Amazon should have been clear about that up front!"
3,Jim's Jeans,"The jeans are as expected of better than average quality and lived up to my expectations. What is unsatisfactory, is the lack of description of the nature of the fabric. Yes, they are denim, but an overwashed and distressed denim that I would not have purchased had the description been accurate."
2,Feels different....Belt loop fiasco,"Well as I already had a pair of these that I bought from the department store I looked forward to getting these jeans. But unfortunately, the feel of the jean in comparison to my first pair is way off. These seem to be thinker, like as if I were wearing thermal underwear. So being close to the hip I didn't feel natural to me. Not to mention one of the belt loops broke. I would of returned it but I really don't have the time so I got it re-stitched. At least I can you them for odd jobs around the house. I'll have to stick to buying jeans on a more personal level."
3,Great Look But Not Very Durable,"These are by far my favorite pair of jeans to wear as they go with just about any shirt or pair of shoes and they're very comfortable, the only problem is they don't last very long. I have a pretty muscular build, at 5'8 inches I am about 160 pounds with thighs that rub together when I walk. The problem with this is my thighs eventually create tears in the groin of these jeans. So far I've purchased these jeans twice and now I'm going on my third pair. The reason I continue to purchase them is because I know exactly how they look and fit on me so just take this as a warning if you have a relatively thick build and are looking to buy these jeans."
3,great jeans,Great jeans and fit great got the midnight ones. The only complaint I have is that the rear res tag doesn't say Levis it just had the circled r so I'm thinking I got a defective pair.
2,hole in the croch already,levis have beengood to me. this time they missed it. croch is too thin holes there in two weeks. new jeans with holes in crich.
5,"Right fit, color and price","Perfect, straight, fit, not baggy or relaxed. Fits true to size. ""tumbled rigid"" is dark blue with no fading or wear. Stitching is not super-high contrast, but classic. And a great price!"
2,quality is only acceptable.,Item came timely but I was disappointed with the quality of the fabric that is different from the traditional jeans.
2,These are NOT denim jeans,"These pants fit just fine, but the material is not standard denim. It is a thinner material with a different texture. I like the fit but the fabric."
2,sizes are smalller,I bougth two jeans waist 33 both fit smaller and in all the other jeans im 33 so cosider buying a bigger sizeI Didnt returned them because im not in the Usathe shiping time was excelllent
3,"Pants are fine, FIT is wrong.",I ordered and received 29w x 30l. I could not pull these all the way up and the couldn't close by several inches. Since when do we have to remember our different sizes in Levi jeans?
1,Poor construction,"I give this a two star rating because the right rear pocket rips and a hole will start in the rear of the pants along the pocket seamI have purchased 4 pairs of the Indigo wash, each pair has done the exact same thing after about two month of use. In summary the worst pair(s) of Levis jeans that I have ever owned."
2,poor quality,"It is damaged now, just after few wearing and few machine laundry. like to get it refund, but i dont kow how."
3,"Good but too tight, be mindful of where the jeans are made","I had bought a pair of 514 Slim Straight jeans a year or so ago and they worked out great so I thought I'd get another pair, just in a different color. However, this pair that I just received is much tighter fitting than my original pair and the only difference is where the jeans were made. So I would just caution everyone to take note of where the jeans are made, because apparently 30x32 slim straight means different things in different countries. Also, in case anyone is interested, Cambodia seems to make jeans that are more comfortable while Sri Lanka makes them fit much tighter."
2,Doesn't feel like real,"I've bought some Levi's jeans over the years from authorized Levi's shops incl. couple of 501s, 508, and 511.When I received the 514 - I bought from Amazon - I really thought that I was getting a fake Levi's jean. It's so light and thin compare to other Levi's I've.I started to wear it today. It feels ok. But I'm still wondering if I'm really getting a cheap knock-of or the real things.Here's the product linkLevi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Jean"
5,Great jeans,"Levi's 514 is baggier than I thought, but it is not too baggy. Great if you're looking for a jeans that is not too skinny like 511 or too baggy like Regular Fit."
5,Excellent fit,"Love these jeans. So hard to find any pants that fit my body type (38 waist 30 inseam).I found others that ""fit"", but don't fit WELL. These aren't baggy in the seat and sit comfortably right at my waist. Once I found these in the store I went online to buy more at a better price. Very happy."
1,awful,"the material was awful, felt like plastic and my son hated them, couldn't return these jeans fast enough and replace them with a better pair"
2,SIZE RUNS SMALLER AND VERY THIN FABRIC...,"I HAVE SEVERAL LEVIS 34x30 JEANS THAT FIT PROPERLY TO ME, BUT THIS RECEIVED RUNS TOO SMALL AND DO NOT FIT TO MY BODY (THERE IS SOME DEFECT WITH THE SIZE)... ALSO, I DONT LIKE THE FABRIC, IT FEEL VERY THIN AND FRAGILE, TOO DIFFERENT FROM MY OTHERS GOOD QUALITY OF LEVIS JEAN ALREADY OWNED... I REALLY DONT LIKE, IT SEEMS A BAD COPY OR FALSE LEVIS JEANS...!!!"
2,Reaction to my purchase of Levi's jeans,"The fit of jeans was fine and so was the color, but the fabric was flimsy compared to the other Levi jeans I have worn in the past. I don't know if this is because the jeans came from a Beals in Florida and the climate there is warmer than it is in Illinois. I was disappointed with the fabric and felt cheated from what I had expected from my order"
3,Different material?,"I have the exact same model and size jeans purchased at a local retailer. The fabric on the pair purchased from Amazon is much much thinner than that of my other pair. They fit fine, identical but the feeling of a nice denim is missing. Does Levi's have different grades for different markets perhaps?"
2,No good,I would not recommend these. They are very light weight - not really like jeans at all. Maybe I will wear them in the summer because too much trouble to return them. I will buy Lee from now on.
1,Very Cheap,"We are very disappointed with Levis and these jeans. These are so thin and cheap. I have buying my husband good old fashion 512's that are truly slim cut, and heavy denim, and always fit. They quit making the 512's and we need to find something else.These are horrible. If you need these for work, don't buy them!Levis were always the workman's jeans, not any more. We'll start shopping other brands."
2,Levi's Mens 514 Straight Blue Collar Jean...34 x 29,Very disappointed with the fabric. Very thin and wrinkles quickly. Not as slim fitting as theold Levi's Slim 512 jeans. Why did they discontinue them??? They were great quality.
2,Half the thickness of my other 514's,I have 2 other pairs od 514's not sure why but the material on these is only <half> the thickness of my others.Very disappointed....makes them fit and look different - worse.
2,"Good fit, Bad quality","I have worn Levi's jeans for most of my life. In the past two years I have bought 4 pairs of Levi's (514 and 501), and they have ripped in the crotch, back pockets, and side seams. The latest pair (514) lasted about three weeks and three times through the washing machine and it literally started to fall apart. I actually patched up the other three pair of jeans to try and stop the tearing, but it only extended the life a few months. It's a shame, Levi's used to be my go-to brand, but the quality has seriously declined over the past few years. The fit is great, but the quality of material is dismal. It is ridiculous to expect a pair of jeans to last only a few months, and some not being able to withstand a cycle through the washing machine. Until Levi's quality picks up, it is time to find another go-to brand."
1,Shrinks 2 sizes after washing,Looks good but one wash and you'll never be able to fit into these again. Must be the 3D Coating.
2,Levi Mens 514 Slim Jeans,"I recently purchased the 514 Levi slim jean because the company had discontinued a style of slim jeans which had been produced for years. What I found was a little different design which I did not like and what I would consider to be a cheaper material than traditional denim. Would I buy them again, NO."
1,garment failed within three weeks,"Purchased a pair for casual wear. The material ripped at the seam around the back pockets within three weeks of purchase. Not impressed with this product, nor the supplier."
1,I won't buy pants in Amazon again...,"It is my first time that I buy this kind of product in AMAZON, I am really disappointed with what I have received. I was waiting a quality pant, but It wasn't like that."
2,"There are better books, even for non-specialists.","I am a non-specialist using this textbook for an introductory college course, but I have read other linguistics books and scholarly articles. In Understanding Language Structure, Interaction, and Variation, definitions are sometimes incorrect or ambiguous; the writing/editing is sloppy; diagrams are not properly labeled.The textbook does cover linguistics topics necessary for teachers.Contemporary Linguistics by O'Grady, Archibald, Aronoff, and Rees-Miller; Language in Society: An Introduction to Sociolinguistics by Suzanne Romaine; The Study of Language by George Yule; and Language: Its Structure and Use by Edward Finegan and Niko Besnier are much better-written."
4,steve khan the green field,Great percussion!! I like the work that khan has been doing in the last few years. Jazz with a Latin touch.
3,Color not as shown...,I bought this simply for the color which is not the turquoise light retro blue shown but more of a darker teal... I would have liked to known this and would have not bought this one.
5,Great for non-stick pans,The handle on this whisk makes it much easier to use than others I've had. Does a good job whisking in my non-stick pans.
3,Decent,"It's o.k. Like the color, design and quality. It seems a bit flimsy. I prefer a whisk that is a bit more study (stiff)."
3,Top Heavy,"I like this whisk when I use it in my large pot. But if I use it in a medium size bowl, it often flings out of the bowl because it is top heavy. Very annoying because foods splatters all over."
1,Waste of time,I used it twice. The second time was to show a friend how cool an automatic centre punch is... and the tip broke right off... he laughed at me!!!Don't bother with this one - move on!Returned for refund.
2,Should have listened to the Pros.,"Well I guess I got skunked on this one,The rod broke after some very light use (wood. sheet metal) and now I can't even find a replacement part. I went ahead and bought a Starrett for about $10 more.This product was really nice to have and light weight but the quality and durability was poor. I was surprised when the tip came sliding out of the barrel and I could see that it had broke at the top, oh well, I guess I can still use it as a scribe."
1,Only works a few dozen times!,The tip broke off after only several dozen uses. The snapping mechanism wouldn't always catch and snap. Don't waste your money on this -- buy a better tool elsewhere!
3,Worked OK for exactly two years,"Bought one almost exactly two years ago to the date it stopped working. Used it regularly but not every day. Up to then it worked OK, with only the rare misfire. Pressure adjustment was adequate - could be adjusted to work on metal or hardwood (on softwood you don't really need the automatic feature, just push). If you need something day in and day out, spend twice as much and get something durable with replaceable tips, it'll be worth it. If you only need it occasionally, or just want a ""window breaker"", it's fine. (I'm replacing this with a Lisle 30280 - it's barely more expensive and has replaceable tips, we'll see how it holds up.)"
2,Sorta crappy,"Mine stopped working after a short while. Then I bought a Starrett. MUCH better. But, the general has a pocket clip, which is nice.And a warning: if you open an automatic punch to see why it's not working, WEAR EYE PROTECTION. The spring narrowly missed my eye."
1,General Tools Automatic Center Punch,"This tool is a classic case of Junk made in China. The thing was worthless; The ""automatic"" mechanism would not work. I sent it back and got a refund."
1,Do not like it,"I have frizzy curly hair and have used separate diffusers for years. I thought I would try something new with this hair dryer. I have had terrible experiences with it. It takes twice as long to dry my hair and honestly, my hair is frizzier. The only bright spot is my curls are better than usual, but I have lost all my volume. Maybe it was just me, but I do not recommend this item."
1,Beware...,The software and drivers would not install properly (XP with Razr V3) after numerous attemps and I find it a completely useless waste of money.
5,"Outrageous, Highly sacrilegious, Well-Performed","In this mock country radio interview/performance disk, TFS and the AoM take the usual pot-shots at stereotypical Christian Country mores: However, it's very cleaver and well-sung. Not for the sensitive or true Believers."
5,LOVE THIS!,I'd forgot about this album and just recently rediscovered it. It's very well done technically and captures the authenticity of a live radio program. The songs are hysterical and the performance spot-on! I've been laughing for days.Amen Sister!!!!
1,boring,"I have just watched this documentary looking forward till it finishes. There are some interesting views of Washington, but it takes too long and the poor narrative information is just full of unimportant quotations by prominent people. A few days ago I saw ""Over Alaska"" and it was the very opposite of what the previous video offers: excellent views, very well narrated with not only basic information about this marvelous state but also nice legends"
2,Poor sound quality,I ended up returning this product as the sound quality was very poor. People would complain that I sounded like I was in a bathroom every time I used this device. It was very comfortable and had some great features like the charging system. USB charging is great. But the poor quality microphone made me return it.
5,great product,very nice. I had a pink ant before this one. It has great clarity and is easy to handle. Great product.
1,I dont like it because..,"I have owned many many BT devices (about 20) and find this one is not very good. First its very uncomfortable in my ear, second it disconnects all the time for no reason and does not connect automatically to the phone when you power it up. Last but not least..the range is very limited compared to a cheaper Jabra and Motorola BT. Lots of static and scratching noises when I'm only a few feet away from my Z3, Pebl or Razr. I will return it for another one and hopefully that one will work better..."
5,Tell it like it is,"I was lucky enough to be in the audience when Nikki Giovanni was a speaker in the Wisconsin Union's Distinguished Lecture Series. The theater was filled and I have never been in an audience that was so enervated, delighted and astounded by a speaker. Giovanni recited some of her poetry, but mostly she expounded on various subjects with amazing wit and pure straight talk.I was therefore happy to find that such priceless ""rants"" make up the bulk of the book ""Blues:For All the Changes"". It was published in 1999, but is oh so relevant today.Here is a line to chew on.""Even when I was in high school, I couldn't understand why all the studies were of Black people.""I feel blessed to have encountered Nikki Giovanni in person and in print."
1,Black anger in poetic form,"Blues...is a collection of short poetry & prose selections, mainly dealing with issues that personally effect the author and her blackness. It's loaded with stereotypes about non-blacks, while being heavy with hatred & condemnation about people who stereotype blacks. Hypocrisy. While some opinions are based in reality, others are just plain wrong subjective conclusions. Aside from the subject matter, the flow of the poems and prose are hit & miss. Some do have a great rhythm & flow, while others just come off as a ripoff of Rabelasian lists and Celineian thought fragments. Instead of getting this non-black reader to understand her situation & sympathize with it, I instead found myself saying ""Did you ever think you have so many problems with white people because you have so much hatred and annimosity towards them?"" There's definately some ""pot calling the kettle black"" shenannigans going on here."
2,No development.,"I only recently discovered Poul Anderson and plan to read more of his works. Unfortunately, I picked a bad place to start. From his Hugo Award and his many rave reviews, I know he must deserve recognition, but not for this book. He spends most of The Rebel Worlds trying to explain the plot and the different races to the readers, but never really develops much in terms of character or action."
5,The Greatest Love Story Ever,"This is the most sensual love story of two lovers seperated by both class and custom. George is an intelligent Parisian rich in both looks and money. Gavin is a strong young Scotsman working hard to make a living, destined to be a fisherman. The two meet in the countryside of Scotland where George's family vacations. The chemistry is instant.Their love affair begins and ends and begins again so many times. They are tested. They are pulled apart by forces both within and without. One thing is constant- their love.You have to see this movie. It is the best movie I have ever seen. It is the only movie I can watch over and over without boredom. It's a tear jerker and a heart warmer. ..."
1,Disappointed with quality and projects,This book was bought by mistake but I thought I'd give it a try but I was very dissapointed in it. It did not offer very many creative projects or very detailed instructions. I enjoy the original books by Lin Wellford and will continue to use hers.
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book and wish I had not wasted my money. The pages are smaller than the standard 8.5 X 11 and there are not very many projects included. The projects that are included have inadequate directions. Most disappinting- I ordered the book based on a preview picture of a nativity figures done on rocks. Turns out the picture is just that - a picture ONLY with NO directions.
2,Not very useful,"I was dissapointed to find out that this book, without phonetic pronunciations, is virtually useless even to someone whose French is pretty good... If you have never seen or used these words before, I DO NOT reccomend it."
3,Street French,"While I bought the book knowing it was used, I anticipated it being clean and with a minimum number of markings. Unfortunately, quite a few of the exercises had actually been worked in pink pen throughout the book. Other than that, the transaction and shipping went smoothly, and I was satisfied with the purchase."
3,according to Wilson the kzen team is no longer the same,"I read many good reviews of the kzen team only to learn that the prestrung kzen team is a mass produced racquet that Wilson says is not the player racquet it previously offered and is not necessarily made to be restrung. Not sure how to tell the differecne, but the prestrung performance racquet sells for around $90 and the old kzen teams apparently sold for much more. Not sure how to tell though and have only hit the prestrung China racquet, and not sure what i have actually bought."
5,Best Racket ever,I have been playing tennis for 3 years and this racket is great for experienced players it has a great hit and serving power. It is one of the best rackets I have ever used. I would recommened this Racket to any experienced players.
5,K ZEN racquet is excellent,I've bought this racquet a few weeks ago. i received it in perfect condition. I already used it several times and it's an excellent racquet. I recommend it to all amateur tennis players.
5,This is an excellent book by a seriouly driven individual,"This book describes the adventures of one of the most dedicated climbers ever. His drive is so strong that one knows that he will be either successful or dead. He was an accomplished leader in the climbing world and is now dead. Some talk the talk, he walked the walk. The text is blunt, honest and irresistible. I have lent my copy to many friends who have all enjoyed it."
5,Sold a book? Then buy this one. A must-have!,"I'm an advertising professional (and a short-story writer with her first collection), and I've read a bunch of books on book publicity. Most were mediocre and full of useless hype. This one is competent and efficient: well written, informative, and no-nonsense. It will clue you in on the essentials, and give you examples of relevant and intelligent press materials that you can adapt to your own use. It alerted me to the fact that, whether my publisher thought so or not, I REALLY needed a professional press packet, and it helped me create one (galley letter, bio, Q&A;, releases, photo, etc.) in less than a week.Intelligent publicity can really help a good book get noticed. If I had the money, I would hire Lissa Warren to publicize my book. This is the next-best thing."
4,I have tape flags on half the pages,"Unbelievably helpful. Although it is aimed at writers who work with conventional publishing, I am self-published and wish I had read it months before my own book [ASIN:0615483720 The Clutter Book: When You Can't Let Go]was published."
4,Publicity,"This book is all about publicity and how to get it for your book. It starts out with ""What is book publiciity?"" and talks about publicity as a process. There is information about getting a freelance publicist vs. working with the publishing house publicist, how to nurture your relationship with your publicist and the author/publicist dynamic.There is useful and relevant information on touring and author events, interviews, how to create ""Buzz"" and how to develop a ""pitch"". I found the chapter on things to do if your book is not getting media attenton to be helpful. The book seems to be mostly about getting publicity and working with the publicist. I found the insights into how publicists work very enlightening. -- Val Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas"
4,Great for Authors and Publicity Consultants,"I am a self-published author (children's) and publicity consultant. Even though my clients have been featured locally and nationally, I've found some great tips in this book. This is a must read for anyone who is writing and/or promoting a book. Thanks Lissa."
2,More self promotion than helpful author reference,"Yes, there are some websites and guidelines to help the new writer, but I was very put off by all the author's focus on herself as opposed to the author. For example, when talking about the role of the publicist (which Warren is) here are some of her ""helpful"" tips for the author: ""She can brake your book. Never lose sight of that fact."" ... and when you return from an author tour and thank the publicist, ""better yet send her flowers or chocolate or a gift certificate for a massage."" and, her ever helpful statement, ""so you see, your publicist is at the center of it all."" There are much better books for authors, including Deval's and Tom & Marilyn Ross' books."
2,Not for the self-published author,"This book is good (and quite detailed) if you have hired a publicist or belong to a major publisher. But, if you're looking for a book to guide you on how to publicize yourself, this is not it.Maybe this will be more helpful for my next book!"
5,Fantastic Book For Authors,"The Savvy Author's Guide to Book Publicity helped me tremendously in planning my future publicity campaign. You'll learn when to begin your campaign, who to approach and where, along with advice for doing it yourself or hiring a freelance publicist. All authors faced with having to promote their own books should know the information between these pages."
4,Quirky adventure,"Very similar to Simon R. Green's ""Nightside"". This quirky adventure is based on funny dialogs rather than on real action or suspense. Thanks to a little green elf who hires him to find a stolen unicorn, PI John Justin Mallory finds himself in an alternate New York where there are yellow elephants instead of taxis, horses talk and stuffed animals don't actually realize they are already dead, where hawkers sell suntan lotion in the middle of a blizzard and there's a Department of a Redundancy Department, among other things. Hilarity ensues, of course.But what I love most is, that amidst all the crazy stuff, Mallory is still a rather ruthless man, punishing and getting rid of anybody who betrays him or hurts his friends and without remorse too. Thanks to Mallory's personality, the book feels grounded, not just... out there."
4,very good/light,"First, I always love Mike Resnick's stories. Some I love a little better than others. This was one of the others. It was fun and light. I could stop reading one night and pick up easily the next. But, I never got stuck reading past my lights out time -- a sign that I wasn't totally engaged. Finally, at the end of the book I felt some connection to the main character, but it took until then for me to really care. This was not a grab you and drag you to the end novel. It did make good light reading."
3,Good but a little wide,"It's a nice product and it's good to have the shelf on the top, but it is just a bit too wide for a standard soda can and when loading often the cans slip sideways and fall through the middle. Annoying to load. Once fully loaded works okay."
4,Well.....,"Well, we were so excited to get our package today. It arrived so quickly! We opened it and proceeded to use the first of the two racks we purchase to load with our Coors cans...oops...Coors cans are ever so slightly longer than a Coke can and do not fit. :( . The Coke cans fit fine and we will keep one rack but we will have to return the other. Even though the width is 6.5"" and the Coors can is 5.25"" it does not fit due to the interior width being slightly less than that."
2,bad cluch,I bought this drill for my wife an daughter in less than a yearThe clutch is bad. The drill has driven only sheet rock screws!
1,Worst writing ever,"This author writes at a junior high school level, and this book reads like a junior high schoolers book report. Simple, boring details abound. Read absolutly any other book about St. Bernard before you read this one."
3,Needs improvment,"I was wishing for the perfect larger pillow to keep my 3 & 5 year olds heads from dropping as they sleep, but it's not much different then the littler ones I purchased for them as babies. Biggest problem is I have no way to attachd the strap in my cars back seats the headrests are contoured with no metal bar or area I can connect the strap too. I tried the latches in the back that are up top and had no way to make that work either. I've tried things to hold it in place, but it slides around alot and really does not stop the head from flopping as I hoped. The idea is ok, but needs improvement."
4,Good,The KidCoddler is okay. I couldn't really get it to stay put around my daughter's head. She ended up using a pillow and blanket instead. Oh well. Hopefully you'll have better luck b/c it is a great idea.
4,Good Biographies.,"Good details, and some fine history made this scarcely studied topic a worthy read. The book focuses on the Mongols finest commanders and their campaigns. Ghenghis, Kublai, Hulegu, and Tamerlane. I liked the latter chapter the best. For a book of less than 200 pages, you get a wealth of information. There are also fine full page illustrations, photographs, drawings and maps."
5,Great!,"This book is absolutely wonderful, good historical detail, good illustrations and all rendered in a very readable and cohesive manner...I hope that everyone who wants a concise and vivid recollection of Mongol early military conquests gets this old, but superb jewel..."
5,Very comfortable!!!,"would recommend to friends and familyThey fit like a glove!I have worn birkenstock for many many years, and the comfort level is still there for me :)"
3,Birkenstock Clog a bit Heavy,"Shoe is a bit hard to get used to wearing. I am taking my time at breaking them in, but if you havesore or sensitive feet, you have to be patient. I am older, and the shoes feel heavy on my feet. Ido have foot problems though. A normal foot will probably adjust to this shoe better then I have."
1,"Great Shoes, Bad Seller","I got these as a gift for my wife. She loves them, the soft foot bed is great, extremely comfortable. She had a bargain pair before but these are a step above.The seller however is horrible. They'll let you place orders and even charge your card but a week or two later send an email saying they are ""out of stock"" and will refund your money. Not good for Christmas shopping. I ended up at a local retailer."
2,Inadequate Description -- Wrong Shoe Sent,"I wanted Birkentstock Boston Black Shoes.They came, but in SUADEI would never have ordered suade.Many times I find the Amazon product description inadequate.I spend many hours trying to figure whether the description shows the product I want to order.Now, looking, I did not see the same page as when I ordered.LIke virtually every other time, I am unwilling to go through the trouble it takes to return.I will wear these and next time I will be extra extra careful.Disappointed,Karl Loren"
5,Fantastic Shoes!,"These shoes are incredibly comfortable. I have worn them everyday since I got them, and I am definitely 100% satisfied with my purchase!"
5,"Amazing, comfortable shoe!!","These are great, but they do fit a bit differently than the Arizona/open toed style--I did order one size smaller and it worked out fine. Well worth the money."
4,Stan's the Man,"Truly a remarkable album!Stan the Man covers the Bass both electric and acoustic,well there is no word to desribe it.Backed by Tony Williams (Tony Williams Lifetime),Jan Hammer (Mahavishnu Orchestra),and Bill Conners (Return to Forever before Al Di Meola),you will be playing air bass before track three is over just like all my friends have the first time I played it for them.I rate at 4 1/2 stars as I quit giving 5 star reviews, but it's really close!Jan Hammer's signiture keyboards is all over this one as is Tony's pounding drums. Bill Conner's guitar playing gives it a little more edge to the sound.The second half features the use of the acoustic bass haves a little more classical feel at times,interesting to say the least.I prefer this over ""School Days"", but both are good (actually I listen to them back to back.)"
3,mixed feelings,"amazing player, but the songs on this album are so lame, i can't sit thru the thing. the writing just isn't on par with the great jazz fusion that was being made at the time, or since. an album every bassist is supposed to own, but there are plenty better ways to dig Stanley, on his own and certainly as a side man playing better material."
1,EX venom,"I got this figure for free in a grab bag first! This IS a pretty rare figure but the DEMAND is next to zero so it has 0 value. But that could all change if for some reason the this Venom becomes popular. It is realy poory done with almost no moving parts. But if you have a flea market booth, I bought ten for $0.99 and sold them for $5 each and sold out in a day. For some reason PPL see ""exclusive and they pounce on it?"
3,X Venom Action figure spiderman,"Not a fun toy really. Very small, and not durable or movable links really."
5,1/16 inch punch,"This is a very good 1/16 inch punch, it worked like it supposed to be. It is made with real metal, I think it is stainless steel. It arrived on time with a reasonable price on Amazon and with no manufacturer's defects, that's good enough for me."
3,Insulated Staple for Coax and RJ45 cables,"I use these when I need to run Coax, and Rj45 cables. It prevents the wire fron getting crimped. It also helps prevent signal loss. Plus when using the Stapler, I can tack with just one hand, as opposed to using a hammer, and nail."
3,ok but...,"These staples bend ..they don't go in the lath or soft wood where i have been working on. I am running cat6 cables and when the staples go all the way in it looks fine, but 4 out 10 staples bend...not good.I give 3 starts because i have 60% rate of success."
4,Stays on through everything,"I used to use the ear buds for my iPod but they would always fall out when I ran (so annoying!). I found out about these headphones in a rave review of them in a magazine. I must say that the review was right on! They stay on through everything, even sit ups and yoga! Another good thing about them is they are covered with water resistant rubber instead of foam that absorbs your sweat-not a nice feeling. The only downside about them in comparsion to the ear buds is sound quality in noisy areas. Because they only sit on your ears instead of in them, if your in a noisy area a good amount of that of noise is able to filter through. Other than that, they are great headphones!"
3,I don't know,"I bought these headphones based on reviews b/c I wanted some headphones that would not fall off when I ran. They may work a little better than the ones I had, but they are not all that great. So I don't know if I would recommend it."
4,Great item,"They are very confortable to run and the sound quality is acceptable, you still hear the outside and enjoy the music. I would have given the 5 stars with more sound clarity. I have both the gray and these, white look cool like my daugther says ipod-ish."
1,"Too Small, And bad sound!","Length:: 1:49 MinsI recommend spending double the money and get the Sennheiser Sport PMX 70 (or better: the updated PMX 80). These headphones are very small for male ears and sound like a can of beans. They actually came off a couple of times as the behind-the-ear design is too small and flexible. They are light-weight, though. So together with the bad sound you won't notice when they fall off and you step on them - no difference either way. I also doubt that they are ""sweatproof"", as only the rubber pieces that touch the ear are ""washable"" with a wet washcloth - the actual drivers have large openings where sweat will run in (yuck). The 24 Ohm impedance makes them also a bit on the quiet side. I definitely NOT recommend them!"
4,love this album!!,"I happen to have the vinyl album (yes, a record) and I plan on buying the CD (for ""burning"" onto my MP3 player). Yes, this album was way overlooked. My favorite songs are ""Let me talk"", ""Turn it into something good"", ""In Time"" and a host of others. I am a true EWF fan and agree with the other reviewers when they said that this album has very good songs. It's just too bad that the radio didn't notice them. For those who want to buy this EWF Faces CD, it's a gem..."
3,Faces,"First of all I have each and every EWF recording and I love this group so please don't hate me for my review on this double record album..While the tunes are nice and sometimes catchy they too many of them and they are not as memorable as tunes on previous albums ..""Let Me Talk"" is predictable and the bass line is too corny to take seriously. The title track is too long and the tempo gets dropped during the song..There are some great moments on the album but not enough to warrant a double set, and I know I'm not the first one to say that this would have been a better product if it were just one ablum..I know I'm going to get a lot of heat for this , but I'm sorry after the previous ten albums this offering don't show any growth in their sound. My theory is that this was the first album using a great number of outside writers that wrote tunes ""for"" EWF and the spirit of the band is missing..Sorry if I offended any hard-core EWF fans like myself..."
4,Coulda' Been Storter,"Let me explain ""Faces"" in the simplist possible way-thisalbum contains the Carribean-inspired pop-funk of ""Let Me Talk"",the grooving ""Pride"",""Win Or Loose"" and ""In Time"" the wonderfulballad ""Turn It Into Something Good"",the tough-rocking funk of""Back On The Road"",the highly dancable ""Share Your Love"",""Song In My Heart"",""And Love Goes On"" and the afro-cuban jam of the elongated tital song.If this had been whittled down to a singleLP containg these 10 songs it would've been a classic-on a par with it's predecessor ""I Am"".But filling it out with four entirely dispencable ballads was a useless proposition unlessyou spend your time PINNING for ""Sparkle"" or ""You Went Away"".All and all-a great double album that coulda' been a CLASSICsingle album,but worth searching out for it's meat,not the fat."
3,Southern Methodism in the early century,"Dr. Steel's book was originally published in 1921. The book has three chapters, plus a foreword. The chapters are: 1. The Modern Theory of the Bible: A critique of the modern intellectual trend to classify/study the Bible on the same level as Homer's Iliad. 2. Genesis in the Light of Modern Science: An explanation, by Dr. Steel, of how Genesis portrays an accurate, scientifically sound depiction of the origin of the universe. 3. The Hebrew Prophets: Praising the Prophets, from Moses to Micah, as visionaries with steadily improving visions of the coming redemption in Christ."
3,Shark Cordless Sweeper,"This sweeper is lightweight and easy to empty, but the swivel sweeper is much better at getting into corners and close to baseboard. You also have to go back over things more than once. It's okay for a quick clean up if you don't expect it to clean up everything. I'm disappointed because it doesn't do a very good job on hard surfaces especially picking up pet hair. It does a better job on carpet."
2,Loved it at first...then it died,"I desperately needed something to clean the one room that has carpeting in my apartment right after my vacuum cleaner died. I decided to get this because it was cheap and it was at a store near me. It worked great!! And then...four months later, the battery wouldn't hold a charge. Now, after owning it for six months, it has completely died. I didn't even use it more than a couple of times a month after I got my replacement vacuum. It was wonderful for picking up cat litter so I didn't have to sweep all the time. It was also great for quickly cleaning the high traffic areas in my aparment. It was horrible at picking things up close to the wall. I had to pull out the broom and dustpan to clean that. It handled well and has a nice low profile to go under furniture. It also was quiet enough that the cats didn't go running and hiding whenever I pulled it out. But, the short life is why it is getting such a low rating."
3,Eh,Its ok. Getting a roomba now instead. If your a sweeper then this is for you. If you like a clean floor go else where.
3,Good for Touch-Ups,"It works pretty well, but it's more suited for quick clean up if you happen to drop something. Not for primary vacuuming use."
2,Not as good as i'd hoped,I had bought one of the original sweeper sharks and LOVE it! But the clear plasic piece wouldn't stay on so I needed to replace it. BUT after looking for the part it was cheaper to buy this little sweeper shark instead. It is quieter BUT it doesn't work very well. IT doesn't clean carpet or rugs very well unless its a flat carpet that doesn't have anything loose fibers. The only good thing is my kids like to use it. BUT I just ended up duct taping the old one back together and it still works better then the new one.
3,So So,Fairly disappointing. The head of the sweeper is so light that it lifts off the ground quite easily when using. When you can manage to keep it on the ground it does a nice job and it hold a charge for a long time.
3,good,"this product works fine but there are newer versions , even by the same manufacturer, that seem better at the same price. Actually I have no complaint about this product...it works fine for me."
3,It's OK,OK pretty much says it all. Not very powerfull but good for a quick clean-up. If you tip it over in any way the dirt will fall right out of it. Not really any better than a regular non-powered sweeper.
